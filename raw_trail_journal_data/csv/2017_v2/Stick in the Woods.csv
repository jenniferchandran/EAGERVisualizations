Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553018,"I woke up feeling nostalgic today and went through some photos from excursions past. I began backpacking in 1997 with my son, Greg, with the Boy Scouts. I have been on several week-long or longer trips with all of my children and one backpacking trip with my wife, Sandy. I decided to add some photos from these excursions, plus three from a day of misadventure that occurred on my trip to Northern Tier. I also threw in a photograph of my thru hike gear, although there have already been a few changes since this picture was taken.",,Nostalgic photos,"Jan 06, Fri",0
Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553284,"We've been pretty much iced in the past few days, so I'm using the time to start organizing my food for food drops. I don't plan on having too many, but I want to have a few ready to make Sandy's job easier when I let her know I'll be needing her to send a mail drop. I'm using the Achilles Method as described by Dan Feldman in his book, Long-Distance Hiking. I was impressed that the first chapter was on diet/food. I am aiming for 4,000 calories per day with a weight of two pounds. And, yes, those are SPAM singles in the case closest to the camera. They were a birthday present from my mom.

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553918,"Hi. Even though I haven't added to my journal in the past few weeks, preparation continues for my upcoming hike. It's starting to get close, as I will be leaving for Georgia in less than ten weeks. We will be in England the week before I leave for the trail, visiting our new granddaughter/niece and her parents (my son, Greg, and his lovely wife, Kathryn).     I have been walking/hiking with my pack several times per week. Becky and I completed our third marathon in November, and I immediately transitioned from running to hiking. I feel pretty good about my cardiovasculars. Stephen and I had a nice hike in the Bray Conservation Area near Rolla this morning. It is a good trail. We saw an armadillo. Stephen recently purchased a new pack, as he plans on hiking with me for a week. Becky also plans on joining me for awhile, perhaps at Harper's Ferry. Stephen and Becky both own Ospreys and seem happy with them. (Becky particularly loves her ""little whistle"" on the chest strap.    I have hiked in temperatures ranging from 21 degrees and windy to 45 degrees. I continue to tweak my clothing list, as well as my other equipment. I should be able to post a finalized equipment list soon. Stephen and I had a great time experimenting with various alcohol stoves the past week. I have decided to stay with my simple can-within-a-can stove and was able to reduce the weight and efficiency by using a smaller outer can. (There is a photo of my stove in my gear section). We were able to boil 2 cups of water with 3/4 ounce of fuel, as opposed to 1 1/4 ounces with my old stove. The boil time also decreased by a few minutes.    I recently received AWOL's Trail Guide and have been studying it as well as watching some YouTube videos. I don't see a reason to over plan too far in advance, but I think I have a handle on my resupply points at least through the Smokies.    I will continue to add journal entries as the big day draws closer.",,Preparation continues,"Jan 29, Sun",0

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554787,"I had a tough decision to make today. Sub at the school or float the Current River with Murph and Glen. Guess which won out? Although I missed my practice hike with Stephen in the afternoon, I was able to practice a vital skill for hiking; eating Nutty Buddy bars. They are the best! Murph and Glen are my transportation to Georgia next month, so I need to stay on their good side. It was a beautiful day on the river. The only thing that would have made it better was if Mike could have been there. We had the river entirely to ourselves from Acres Ferry to Pulltite, except for the bald eagles (we saw eight), the red-tailed hawk, the red-headed woodpecker, the heron, the ducks, the kingfishers, and the turtles.

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555154,"I believe I have pretty much completed getting my gear together, although I still have several weeks to tweak things. I have added descriptions of much of my gear in the gear section of my journal. I have not listed the small items such as toothbrush, compass, lighters, etc. My cold weather base weight comes out at just over 15 pounds and my projected warm weather base weight should be at least a half pound lighter. I am sure I will be making adjustments as I gain experience on the trail. The photo is pretty accurate, although it was taken a few months ago. If anyone has any input or questions, please feel free to comment in the guest book, and I will be sure to respond. It is less than six weeks until I start on the trail.

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558561,"Sandy, Stephen, Becky, and I just spent a wonderful week in Sheffield, England, visiting our son, our lovely daughter-in-law, and our new grand baby. We had a splendid time. Sheffield is not particularly a tourist destination, and the people tend to be very friendly and open. In between times of spoiling the baby, we also visited two museums, sampled a good deal of locally brewed beers, ate in several restaurants, and went on a daily walk around Sheffield. We walked in numerous directions and saw a good deal of the city of Sheffield. There is a good amount of green space, and we were able to walk in wooded areas quite a bit. This photo was taken while we were walking part of the Sheffield Round Walk Trail and shows residential areas in the background. While we didn't make it to the Peaks District on this trip (visiting the baby took precedence over all else), Sheffield is a very hilly town, and we were able to get some good, brisk walks in. I'm home now and getting ready to leave for the trail in a few days.    I was diagnosed years ago by a nurse friend of mine with ""Old Man Feet."" I've used Amlactin lotion for years on my feet with good success. I didn't pack any for our trip to England, and within two days I developed painful cracks on the bottoms of my feet. I used bandaids (they are called ""plasters"" in England) and antibiotic ointment on the cracks and got along okay. Lesson learned: I will be taking Amlactin on the trail.    I have everything together and ready to go. My final base weight with my cold weather gear is 14.4 pounds, and I feel pretty good about that. I have a few loose ends to clear up (including getting a hair cut and finishing our Income Tax return) and feel like I should be ready to head out on Wednesday.

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558720,"I will always remember when I first met Beau. It was in June of 1994. I was a Camp Director of our annual Cub Scout Day Camp, and Beau was a young Cub Scout who had just moved to Rolla, Missouri, from Arkansas. He was with his parents, Kim and Sue, and was wearing his blue Cub Scout uniform, complete with a red patch vest. His vest was too big for him. Following the suggestion of the Cub Scouts, it was large so he would be able to grow into it over the years. By the time Beau graduated into Boy Scouts years later, the vest fit just fine. Beau was excited and proud to be a Cub Scout, and I told him that I still had my vest from when I was a Scout. I brought my vest to show Beau at our next Cub Scout Pack meeting, and a friendship was born.        Four years later, Beau completed Cub Scouts by earning his Arrow of Light Award and joined Boy Scouts. I had become an Assistant Scout Master by this time and had helped organize a high adventure group within the troop for the scouts (and leaders) who wanted to experience more challenging, outdoor adventures. Beau immediately became involved with this group, and the other scouts quickly took him under their wings and made him, the youngest member of the group, feel welcome. During his first equipment shake down, where new backpackers bring their gear to a Scout meeting for inspection, the older scouts helped Beau go through his equipment to pare out things he didn’t really need on the trip. Beau listened attentively and removed several heavy items. Being somewhat confident and headstrong (a characteristic that would serve him well in later years as a youth leader in the troop) Beau decided to return some of these items prior to the weekend backpacking trip. He struggled toward the end of the first day, and we decided to remove some weight from his pack to help him out. I explained that this was not unusual and that the crew all worked together for the good of all. I had to chuckle when he removed his Boy Scout handbook, complete with a leather case from his backpack. For years afterward, when we were conducting shake downs with new scouts or teaching backpacking techniques to other groups, I would always ask him: “Beau, do you need your Boy Scout handbook on a backpacking trip?” “Yes, Sir,” he would always reply. “And where should you carry your Boy Scout handbook, Beau?” “In your head,” was his answer. Being the youngest member of the adventure group, Beau was too young to attend our trek to Philmont Scout Reservation in 1999, but he participated in all of our training trips and could always be counted on the pull his weight and more. After a particularly challenging hike, conducted in the heat and humidity of a Missouri summer, I told Beau that I would hike with him anytime, anywhere. He would later participate in a Philmont trek as well as a trip to Northern Tier. Beau quickly became a leader in both the high adventure group and the troop as a whole. He was upbeat, kind, and popular, and a natural leader with the boys. He became Senior Patrol Leader in the summer of 1999 and served a six-month term. Being Senior Patrol Leader of a large troop is a demanding job, and most boys are more than happy to step down after their term. I became Scoutmaster in February of 2000 and approached Beau with a proposition. Since the troop would be undergoing a major transition of having a new adult leader, it would help if we could keep stability in the youth leadership. I asked him to consider running for the position of Senior Patrol Leader for another term. He agreed and was instrumental in the smooth transition of leadership. Four years later, my son, Stephen, would follow in Beau’s footsteps and do the same for my replacement as Scout Master.Beau earned his Eagle Scout award. His project, a landscaping project to benefit a local retirement home, was well thought out and implemented. My daughter, Becky, worked on the project, and Beau went out of his way to make sure she felt appreciated. Beau’s deep love for his parents was so evident during this time, particularly his Eagle Scout Ceremony. Like me, Beau wasn’t too excited about what he called “pomp and circumstance,” but he knew what the ceremony would mean for Sue and Kim. Reflecting his love for the outdoors, however, the ceremony was held in a local park.Beau started talking about thru hiking the Appalachian Trail with me while he was still a Cub Scout. It might have even come up while I was sharing my Scout vest when he was so young. I told him how much I loved hiking and that someday I planned on hiking all the way from Georgia to Maine. He decided then and there that he would accompany me. A pipe dream, perhaps, but his decision never wavered. He always told me that somehow, someway he would arrange it so we could hike together.Tragically, Beau was hit by a drunk driver while riding his motorcycle on July 3, 2003. He was very seriously injured and was never able to heal from some of his injuries. Beau passed away on March 2, 2007 as a result of these injuries. A short while later, Kim and Sue returned to Rolla with Beau’s remains to spread his ashes at his favorite backpacking spot. A group of us hiked several miles to a bluff along the Paddy Creek trail in south central Missouri. We spent about an hour laughing, crying, and singing the silly songs that Beau loved. A single butterfly, the only one we would see all day, landed on Kim’s shoulder and remained there for the entire time. Only when we were leaving for the return hike did the butterfly fly away. Kim and Sue told me afterward that the butterfly is the symbol of their grief support group.I will have a small vessel containing some of Beau’s remains with me during my hike. In this small way, Beau and I will be fulfilling our promise to hike the trail together. God speed, my friend. I love you.",,Beau,"Apr 04, Tue",0

Sandy drove me to Murph's this morning at 5:45. Stephen also showed up to say goodbye. Murph, Glen, angd I hit the road at 6:00. Glen was pilot and Murph served as navigator. The poor GPS spent the first hour trying to tell us to turn around before it gave up and pouted. We had quite a scenic drive indeed. At one time it took us thirty minutes to get two miles closer. We enjoyed pizza and beer at Murph's brother's house in Nashville this evening. We will spend the night at his house and will get to Amacolala Falls State Park tomorrow. We will spend the night in a cabin, and I will start on the trail Friday morning. It's getting real!",,On the road ,"Apr 05, Wed",0

I made 13 miles, but it was tough going. I feel good, though. No blisters or sore joints. It is amazing to walk through the Woods while being challenged by the steep grades (yes, up and down). I hiked up and over Sassafras Mountain and then Justus Mountain. I saw several birds. I think one was an owl. I saw a few squirrels but no bears yet. I hiked by myself most of the day.

The view from Preaching Rock was stunning. I guess it's fitting I was here on a Sunday. I left Gooch a little before 9:00 and got to Lance Creek before three. I considered going on, but decided to stick to plan. I only have 7.2 miles tomorrow to Neels Gap. Will climb Blood Mountain tomorrow, which will be my toughest climb yet. I met some really nice people today. I met Snail from Germany, who is also thru hiking. I also met Sticks, Stones, and Bear Pinata (who sleeps in a hammock). I actually came up with her name, and she liked it. It was nice to get in early and chill out for a bit. I may stay in a hostel for the first time tomorrow.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559581,"I got an earlier start this morning and was on thetrail by 8:15. The climb up Blood Mountain was challenging but not as bad as Sassafras. The climb down was incredibly steep and rocky. Often, there were blazes painted directly on the rocks. The view from Blood Mountain was stunning (I added a picture in the photo section). I made it to Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap in good time. The trail goes right through the building, the only time the AT is indoors. I ate an entire pizza (except for the olives). The hostel was closed, so I took a chance and walked down to Blood Mountain Cabins. They were full, so I was getting ready to get back on the trail when my first Trail Angel, Kevin walked by and said they had an extra bed in his cabin. I am staying tonight at Wolf Cabin with Kevin, Joe, and Chop Sticks. I have a bed, a shower, a flushing toilet, and clean laundry for only $18.00. Probably the best deal on the trail.

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559748,"I had a good sleep at the cabin and took another shower this morning just because I could. It was nice not having to watch how much toilet paper to use (one of life's little pleasures). It was a good hike today, with one particularly steep climb out of Tesnatee Gap. I guess to no one's surprise, I am one of the slowest hikers on the trail. It's not just that I happen to stop and talk to people I meet (imagine that!), but I am concentrating on taking it slow, particularly down hills to protect my knees. So far, so good. I also find that on the times I can hike faster, I am choosing not to. Part of this is to rest for the inevitable next ascent or descent, but I am also really enjoying just walking in the Woods. I know there will be days when I will have to make miles, and I figure I will be ready when I need to. I have met some really nice people. Dapper Dan and I met the first night and have been camping together several nights. I met Journey and Tundra today. Tundra is a wonderful dog who is taking her human for a walk. It is a beautiful evening and I'm going to sign off now to finish supper and go visit by the shelter. Happy Trails!

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559894,"I have often said, ""Planning is everything, the plan is nothing."" Today is the first day I ended up changing my plan. I got off to a good start from Low Gap at 8:30. The first several miles were on an old logging road, complete with some impressive stone retaining walls. It was far and away the easiest hiking so far. Soon enough, the AT got back to normal and headed up Blue Mountain. While steep, the trail reminded me more of the Ozarks Trail at home. It was more of an earthen trail with rocks added to make it more interesting, as opposed to the rock scrambling of the past few days. I made pretty good time and ate lunch with some fellow hikers at Blue Mountain Shelter. I then descended to Unicoi Gap. I talked with a young woman who was waiting for a ride and then began the ascent of Rocky Mountain. While the AT is a popular trail, I wouldn't see another person for over four hours and 5 1/2 miles of hiking. After descending Rocky Mountain, I got to Cheese Factory Site, where I had planned to camp. There is nothing left of the old cheese factory, but there was a lot of pre-cut firewood and a huge fire ring. The site was also right by a road. I decided I still felt strong, so I decided to head for Tray Gap Shelter, which was two miles further. The only potential problem was that Tray Mountain was between me and my campsite. Powered by a Nutty Buddy Bar, I completed the additional miles with no problem and enjoyed a beautiful view from the top of Tray Mountain. I got to my campsite at 7:15 and got my tent set up. I had to finish a few of my chores by headlamp and enjoyed chatting with hikers I hadn't met before. I am really pleased with today. I went two miles further than I planned and hiked up and over three mountains. I am a little sore but still feel good. It's late now, and I want to get an early start tomorrow.

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559989,"I rested well but did not sleep much last night. I felt good this morning and was only a little delayed by needing to get water. The water source was very interesting and had obviously been part of someone's home at one time. I got to the trail and immediately got confused about which direction to go. Those who know me will not be surprised. I thought I had it figured out when Alex, a fellow thru hiker came by and confirmed my guess. I have decided there will be a new meaning to Stick in the Woods. I am now going to discretely make an arrow out of sticks by the shelter trail every time I get to a shelter. In the morning, I'll take it apart. I met several hikers today and actually hiked a few hours with Wizard. He is a young man who plans to finish college and run track for his school. Alex and I met up later on the trail, and we both stayed at Top of Georgia Hostel near Dicks Creek Gap. I wasn't planning on taking the shuttle into Hiawassee, but I am really glad I did. A bunch of us went to Daniels for an AYCE (all you can eat) buffet. We then went to Ingle's for resupply.

I left Dicks Creek Gap at 8:20 and strolled into Standing Indian Shelter at 7:15. It was another tough day of hiking, but I still felt pretty strong when I got to camp. I met several people today. I met Mac, a trail maintainer. I was very impressed with the trail in Georgia and thanked him. I ran into Andrew, Chris, Andrew, and David for the last time today. They were doing a section hike and were finishing up. We camped together a few times, most noticeable in ""the Projects"" at Gooch Mountain Shelter. We had all gotten there late and ended up sleeping on a pretty steep slope. I ran into them at Bull Gap. They had helped a young woman hiker who had twisted her ankle. By the time I arrived, a medic was on the scene to take her to the hospital. It served as a reminder how easy it can be to be injured. The highlight of the day was passing into North Carolina. I met Nemo there, and we took each other's photos. He had a hip replacement at 21 years old and is planning on thru hiking (thus the trail name, Nemo).

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560217,"Today took a few unexpected turns. I was not as sore as I thought I would be after the long day yesterday. I planned on only going to Carter Gap Shelter, a distance of 7.6 miles. The trail up Standing Indian Mountain was much less difficult than I expected. At 5,435 feet, it is the first mountain over 5,000 feet on the trail. Unfortunately, there were no views. I continued on and got to Carter Gap at 1:00. I had a nice lunch (another Spam burrito) and caught up with my website, since I didn't have service last night. I felt too good and the weather was too nice to stop. I hiked almost all day in the burned results of last fall's forest fires. I hiked on to Betty Creek Gap and considered staying there but decided to go a bit further to Mooney Gap. Unfortunately, I was met by a sign that said No Camping. I continued on, hoping to find a spot flat enough to camp. I met my three newest Trail Angels, Tristan, Annie, and Annie. They already had camp set up on this nice flat spot near a water source, no less. I asked them if they knew of any other spots up the trail, and they insisted I set up next to them. It is the nicest camping spot to date. We had a nice chat. I ended up going 12.1 miles today and only have 11.4 miles to Winding Stair Gap, where I will catch a shuttle to Franklin for my next resupply.

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560408,"What a day for Easter magic on the trail. I got off to an early start and said farewell to Tristan, Annie, and Annie at 7:45. I made good time to the approach trail to Albert Mountain and was able to talk with Sandy and Becky to wish them a Happy Easter. I also called my mom and got to talk a bit until we lost service. I also received an email from my son, Greg, that included a perfect picture of my grand daughter, Rose, in her Easter dress. The approach trail to Albert Mountain was incredibly steep and rocky. Several times I had to crawl up on hands and feet over solid rock. I was impressed with how alone you can be on the trail. I spent over 30 minutes on the top of the mountain and never saw anyone ekse. It makes you extra careful as the trail can be quite challenging at times. The view from the top of Albert Mountain was cloudy but amazing. It was windy, but I went ahead and climbed to the top of the fire tower. I set some of Beau's ashes free into the wind. I then sat on the foundation for a bit before heading for Rock Gap, where Jose told me there would be eggs for hikers at 2:00. Just a little past the mountain, I crossed the 100 mile marker. Only 2,091 miles to go! I made good time and arrived at Rock Gap at a bit before 1:00. Several other hikers arrived soon after I did. A very nice woman named Ginny passed out colored hard boiled eggs and candy to us. I told her she was my Easter Bunny. I thought this was the eggs that Jose told me about so I prepared to hike on. Several of tbe other hikers told me to wait. I enjoyed visiting with several ""old"" hiker friends and made some new ones. A bit after 2:00, several cars, trucks, and a dump truck full of furniture and stuff pulled up. The Omelet Angels had arrived! These wonderful people put on a feed that had to be seen to be believed. Everyone pitched in and helped set up dining flies, tables, and chairs. There were cookies, candy, and fruit, and perhaps the best hot chai latte in the world. Then the cooking began in earnest. Everyone received a menu to order our personalized omelet and trail sandwich. There was so much food and fellowship that I was completely awed by it. A special thanks to Tarheel, The Cook, TAA (Trail Angel Assistant), Repeat and Di (who was there with her grandbaby), Weatherman, Black Hawk, Emory, Janice, Tom, and Jae. I hope I didn't leave any of you out. You guys are the best! After the feed, a few of us decided to hike on to Winding Stair Gap, 3.7 miles away. Trail Mix, who ate two omelets and his sandwich, decided to stsy at Rock Gap. I are one omelet and saved my sandwich, so I decided to hike on. I hiked along another area that had been greatly affected by last November's forest fires. I again was struck with how alone you can be on the trail. After all of the camaraderie of the past few hours, I was again alone along a somewhat difficult trail. I met Deogenes when he passed me about 1.5 miles from Winding Stair Gap. He was setting up his hammock when I arrived at a campsite near the roadway. I joined him, and we had a nice long chat while setting up camp. He is from Oregon and has already hiked the PCT. We headed for bed around 9:00, when it starts to get dark. This is called Hiker Midnight on the trail. I plan on taking the shuttle into Franklin tomorrow morning and will take my first zero day. I hope everyonehad a happy and blessed Easter!","Mooney Gap

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560524,"I decided to take my first zero day by going into Franklin, North Carolina for the day. Franklin is highly reviewed in books and you tube videos, and I can see why. Ron Haven, the owner of the hostel where I stayed, drove the free shuttle into town. He provides this service for all hikers, even those who don't stay in his hostel. He was very entertaining and informative. I got my hostel bed number and was pleased to see I got a lower bunk this time. Soon, however, a very large hiker from Germany asked if I would consider switching bunks, which I agreed to do. After a shower and washing my clothes, I headed for the Motor Co. Grill for lunch. I had a hamburger and fries. I then went to the Lazy Hiker Brewery for a flight of very tasty beers. I met Brent and Laurie there. Laurie is an Occupational Therapist from Louisiana, and we had a great conversation about the needs of special education students. From there I headed for Dollar General for resupply. After that, I reorganized my food for the next four days before my next resupply. I then headed back to the Lazy Hiker Brewery for supper at the lunch truck next to it. A cheeseburger and fries. Am I detecting a pattern here? I had a small pour of a good APA there while we all waited out the downpour. After the rain slackened, Alex, Kevin, and I headed to the Currahee Brewery across town. It was a nice brew pub in a very large metal warehouse building. I again had a small pour. From there it was back to the hostel to update my journal and head to bed. I plan on taking the 9:00 shuttle back to Winding Stair Gap to continue my hike. Rain is likely tomorrow, but, as they say: No rain, no pain, no Maine. I met several other interesting people. I met Sam and Martin from London while waiting for the shuttle this morning. We had a good chat about England, and they agreed that Rose is probably the most beautiful baby ever. I met Walter the guard dog, who guarded my food while I checked on my laundry. He was very interested in my food. He obviously takes good care of his human, Palace. Well, it's back to the trail tomorrow. I am looking at another 16 miles to Cold Spring Shelter. I should be at Fontana Dam, the gateway to the Smokies, in about four days.","Winding Stair Gap

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560701,"After saying goodbye to Chaos, Mayhem, and Doogie at the hostel (Baloo was still in bed) I got on the shuttle bus back to Winding Stair Gap. Dapper and Alex had double zeroed at Franklin and were also on the shuttle. I started hiking at 9:30 in a steady drizzle. The rain wouldn't stop until around 2:00. I didn't opt to wear my rain jacket. I sweat so much in one, that I have to decide I'd be better off with one. If it had rained harder, or if it would have gotten cooler or windier, I would have put it on, but it didn't. I enjoyed the cooler temperatures, but the rain caused the trail to become increasingly muddy, which added another challenge. I wanted to get to Cold Spring, which was 15.8 miles of hiking. It was a long way, but I got in at 6:15 none the worse for wear. The stone tower at Wayah Bald was on the route today. It was foggy and misty when I arrived, but the view was still eerily beautiful. The forest around the tower was heavily affected by November's fires. The wooden upper story to the tower was completely destroyed. I met my second hiker named Nemo (as far as I know, there is only one Stick in the Woods). He told me he had slept in the upper story of the tower on his 2014 thru hike. He assured me the views were beautiful when they aren't shrouded by fog, mist, and rain. I hiked steadily onward through moderately difficult terrain and reached camp by 6:15. The rain had slackened off by around 2:00. I visited with a group of four really nice fellows about my age who are staying in the shelter tonight. The shelter is a fascinating log structure, one of the oldest on the AT. It was built by the CCC in the 1930s. They told me that the ""youngsters"" had been asking about me and that they had been asked to hurry me along the way. After getting and filtering my water at the stream by the shelter, I hiked on the short distance to the tent area. Most of the young set had arrived a few hours earlier and were having dinner. I joined Billy, Dapper, Alex, Kevin, and Kirk for dinner before setting up my tent. It touches my heart to see what wonderful people they are and how glad they are to see me when I arrive. After dinner I hung my food bag and set up my tent. A light drizzle started while I was finishing up. A heavy rain is now falling as I write this, but I am snug, warm, and dry in my tent. I head for the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) tomorrow. In a few days, I will be in the Great Smoky Mountains.","Franklin, NC

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560837,"I got the best night of sleep on the trail so far and was packed and ready to hit the trail by 8:30. I hiked in a dense fog until early afternoon. The trail up Wesser Bald was moderately difficult. There had been a forest fire in the area just last week, which had closed 10 miles of the section I hiked today. It was very eerie to hike through the charred forest in the thick fog. If it had been warmer, I would have thought I was in Mordor. I made it to the top of Wesser Bald in good time and enjoyed climbing the observation tower although there was nothing to see. Rumor has it that the views are stunning in clear weather. The first part of the descent from Wesser Bald was the toughest hiking I have done since Blood Mountain. There were several rocks that I initially thought were overlook rocks and was surprised to see the trail went down them. I tried climbing down the first one in a conventional manner and fell for the first time on the trip. Fortunately, I positioned myself so I fell into the rock and was fine. The other ones, I turned around and crawled down facing the rock. I have decided that climbing down rock faces is more challenging than climbing up them. There was a long descent into the NOC today, and I get to make a similar ascent to get out of the valley tomorrow. I stayed in the hiker bunkhouse, which was inexpensive. I ate dinner with the same group as last night, and we had a great time. I plan on leaving early in the morning and hope to cover 15.8 miles tomorrow. This should get me to Fontana Dam by Friday. I should be getting my replacement buckle for my pack and helps me be able to make it to Hot Springs when Stephen is scheduled to arrive. I met some wonderful people (and dogs) today. I have posted pictures of many of them. There was Coffee and Cocoa, Old Smokey and Dusty, Ski Poles, and Montana and Montana, Too. I met the Montanas (Dave and Donna) on the trail near the NOC, and we hiked together for awhile. Montana has been section hiking for 19 years and is within 300 miles of completing the trail. He is very knowledgeable and told me to expect many rocky challenges in New Hampshire. Best of all, I now have a standing invitation to come to Glacier National Park. Perhaps a vacation for Sandy and me someday. One of the things I love best about the AT (besides the six to eleven hours of arduous walking every day) is the interesting and friendly people you meet every day. Montana compared the AT today to one long, skinny neighborhood full of great people. I have to agree.","Cold Creek Shelter Campground

I woke up early because I knew I had a long day ahead of me with two tough, although very different, climbs. The first thing I did was check my laundry. I forgot to mention yesterday that I was a bit put out that the coin laundry was as far as possible from the bunkhouse. So I pulled a real hiker trash and took my laundry into the shower with me and washed it there. Everything was dry except my socks. I started hiking in a drizzle which ended a few minutes into my hike. The hike out of NOC was long and steep. We added 3,330 feet over 7.9 miles. I met Blaze early in the day. We had a nice chat. He is also from Missouri.  With a name like Blaze, he was already hiking 25+ mile days. I doubt I will ever see him again. While talking with Blaze, I met the only truly obnoxious hiker I have met to date. He interupted our  conversation by looking us up and down and saying, ""You guys are both Nobos, aren't you?  (A Nobo is an AT northbound hiker. It is a descriptive term only.  A Sobo is southbound).  I said yes, and he dismissively said, ""I'm Southbound. The only time I walk north is to get water.""  He said that Sobos look forward to Georgia since it is so easy for them. (It turns out that he really hasn't done that much hiking).  He then looked at my shoes and told me I'd never make it to Maine wearing tennis shows. I started to explain when he bragged to me that his pack weighs 50 pounds and he did 25 mile days. I remembered that one meaning of ""Hike your own hike"" is, ""You're a jerk and this conversation is over.""  So I said, ""I'm happy for you, and that's why we all hike our own hike.""  I got even, though, by not taking his picture. There were nice views today and the forest is becoming very green. The day ended with another tough climb of a different kind. Jacob's Ladder is a 598 foot climb over .6 miles. It was tough but there was no rock scrambling. I got into Brown Fork Gap after a tough but rewarding 15.8 mile day.","The Nantahala Outdoor Center

Today was a much easier day of hiking. I got into Fontana Dam and met up with Alex, Dapper, Kevin, and Billy. There were some nice views today as well. After getting to the lake, we took a shuttle into Fontana Village Resort.  Kevin and I finally found the Lodge and picked up our packages. Kevin got his permit for the Smokies; I printed mine out at home. After dinner at the grill, we took the shuttle back to the lake and hiked the final mile to the Shelter. I set up my tent and sorted out my supply box which had all my food for the Smokies. I hoped to charge my phone before the Smokies, but the solar charging station was working in reverse. While sorting my food, I met Katie, who was cooking her dinner. She had gotten ill for two days at Neel Gap and had a cortisone shot in her knee. She was wearing a knee brace. I gave her her trail name of Katie Robo-Knee. I also met One Gallon while talking with Katie. Rather than hanging my food in a tree, I stashed it in the back of the bear-proof trash container. I took a cold shower at the ""Fontana Hilton"" and went to bed early with the beginning of a thunderstorm. I slept well and the rain ended during the night.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

4/22Fontana Dam to Russell Field Shelter 
The rain stopped during the night, and I woke to a brisk, but dry, morning. Katie Robo-Knee was getting ready the same time as I was, and we decided to hike together today. They had announced an all-day hiker feed for today, but it wasn't scheduled to start until 9:00, and we decided we didn't want to wait that long. We hiked across Fontana Dam, which was very impressive. Soon after that, we were in the Smokies. We placed our mandatory  $20 permits in the box and started the long climb into the mountains. It was steep and long, but the trail was pretty good. We climbed until we reached the Shuckstack Fire Tower. Those of you who know me know how difficult it is for me to climb fire towers, but I did it. I am actually surprised it is still allowed. There is a railing missing on the first tier of steps, and the floor of the observation deck consists of several layers of plywood. Climb I did, however, and made it onto the observation deck.  One Gallon was already there, and he got to hear the tale of my fear of heights. It was very windy, but I stayed up there awhile. On my way down, the wind blew a piece of window molding off the tower, missing my head by about a foot. There was no worry of me falling, however, because I had a death grip on the railing. Katie Robo-Knee and I hiked all the way to Russell Field Shelter. There, we were in for a huge surprise. A 2014 sobo thru hiker named Woodford wanted to give back to the trail by providing trail magic at the shelter. Along with his mentor, Wildcat, they provided brats with peppers and onions cooked in foil. He ""convinced"" me to have a double brat. They were delicious. True to his trail name, he also offered some Woodford Bourbon to all takers. I had a small amount to sip (and to think I was considering getting rid of my small cup to cut weight!).  It began to rain as darkness fell, and there was quite a thunderstorm that night. It rained most of the night, but I stayed warm and (mostly) dry throughout the night.","Fontana Dam

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561443,"Woke up to rain and hiked in a steady rain at about 45 degrees all day. The trail was very challenging. Sometimes the trail was like a rushing creek. Other times it was like walking through leaf/mud pudding. There were very slick muddy spots, and I ""only"" fell seven times. I also got turned around at the shelter where I ate lunch and actually hiked the wrong way for a few minutes. We all knew this would happen, and it's easier to do than you might think. I hiked exactly twelve hours today 7:15 am to 7:15 pm. I set my tent up in the rain and most everything is wet. It was a great adventure, and I had a wonderful time. It probably wasn't the wisest of decision (I found out later that many hikers took zeroes in shelters) but it was quite an adventure. Unfortunately, my camera might be a casualty. I am going to ask Stephen to bring a bag of rice to Hot Springs. It was in a Ziploc bag in a waterproof pouch, but pretty much everything is damp if not wet.","Russell Field Shelter

It wasn't marked, but somewhere between Mt. Love and Collins Gap, I completed my 200th mile on the trail. The weather was better but still misty. I was completely fogged in at Newfound Gap.

I climbed up on Charlie's Bunion for good measure. I also hoped to see more wildlife but no luck there. It was cold and foggy, so the animals were probably hunkered down staying warm. I also hoped for a long day. I have no deadline for completing the AT, but Stephen will be in Hot Springs on Friday evening to hike with me for a week.

I wonder if hiking for three days in wet feet might have something to do with that. I taped it and felt no discomfort during my hike today. I got another very early start, because I wanted to get to Standing Bear Farm Hostel with plenty of time to get things dried out and cleaned up. After a few miles, however, I couldn't resist taking the .6 mile side trail to see the Mt. Cammerer lookout tower. I am so glad I did. It is an amazing octagonal stone lookout tower perched on the top of the mountain. Built in 1938, it is a marvel. It required scrambling over big rocks to get to it. It amazes me that people worked in the tower into the 1960s, keeping a watch out for fires. I also saw some spectacular views, the first in several days. Even with the extra hour sidetrip, the northern trail out of the Smokies is very good trail, and I made good time. I crossed under Highway 40, where Sandy and I visited on our way home from Savannah last October. I placed a dime under a rock by an AT sign in October and retrieved it today. I also happened to meet Miss Janet, a famous trail angel in these parts. I got to the hostel at 1:15. It is quite a place. Clark pretty much runs the place. I got a bed in the bunkhouse and did my laundry by hand using a washboard. The amount of dirt and mud that I removed was quite a sight. I had a large supreme pizza and a couple of PBRs. I also drank three Gatorades. There was quite a h
iker gathering when I got here, but most have left to get back on the trail (they stayed last night). I had a very cold shower which helped wake me up. Most of my stuff is dry again.

The day began with a long, high ascent to the top of Snowbird Mountain (2,475 feet ascent in 4 1/2 miles. The trail was good, which helped a lot. There is an FAA facility on the top. It was very windy, and I had to lean into the wind to walk off the top. I stayed to watch a large, black bird do aerobatics in the gusts. There was intermittent sun and rain all day. I had beautiful 360 degree views from Max Patch near the end of the day. I was pretty beat when I got to the Roaring Fork camp area. The blister on my right toe was really hurting, and I had to really concentrate on not limping, since this could affect my knee. I found a nice, flat spot for my tent and set up camp. I made dinner at the shelter area, where I met Tump and Poke from Texas. It turns out that Tump (which is a term in Texas for falling over) and Poke had their son coming to Hot Springs from Missouri this weekend to hike with them to Erwin, Tennessee. It also turns out that they run marathons with their daughters. How's that for a coincidence? Poke told me she got her trail name because she is pokey. I told her that in the Yukon, a poke was your stake, your gold. She liked the alternative meaning. I went to bed early and found that the tape I had put around my blister had come off during the day. I cleaned it with alcohol (which stung a bit) and applied a bandaid with antibiotic ointment. I am a little peeved with myself for not taking better care of it earlier.

They say, ""No rain, no pain, no Maine,"" so I guess I am getting all of my bases covered. There was good trail again today with some very steep ascents and descents, but few were very long. I had some very nice views on Walnut Mountain early in the hike.  I saw Tump and Poke along the trail (they left later but hike faster than I do) and got their photo. They are very excited about having their son visit, as am I. I was able to get a text to Stephen, and he was successful in finding us a place to stay tonight: The Belle of Hot Springs Hotel. We will be zeroing in Hot Springs tomorrow and staying at Elmer's Sunnybank Hostel tomorrow night. We will hit the trail on Sunday. It was very cool walking into Hot Springs. This is the first town the trail actually passes through. The AT emblem is embossed in the sidewalk. I got into town around 5:15.  When Stephen arrived, we checked into the hotel, which is a very nice older home. It's really more of a bed and breakfast. The owner was very nice and helpful. We then went to dinner at the Smoky Mountain Diner. I had the Hungry Hiker burger and fries  (of course).  Stephen had the barbecue burger. We also had apple pie and ice cream for dessert. We then went to the Spring Creek Tavern for a beer and enjoyed the local craft beer and live music. We then called it an early night and went to bed.  I met some interesting people on the trail today. There was Snacks, the first southbounder I've met (she took the winter off).  I also met Waffles from Southhampton, England, sitting on a bluff enjoying the breeze. Instead of taking an off year after graduating from University in London to party, she decided to hike the AT. Her real middle name is Rose, and she was very impressed with how cute our Rose is. I hiked into Hot Springs with Dutch. He and I have similar ideas about making sure we take the time to enjoy the experience of the journey and not just hike from shelter to shelter.

We shared breakfast with Classy and her mother, Mrs. Potts. Classy is thru hiking before she begins her residency at John Hopkins. Her mother hiked with her for the past week. We had originally planned on going across the street for ""second breakfast,"" but we were both too full. We headed down main street so I could get my laundry done. Along the way, we stopped to buy some home baked bread and visited the public library. We met Billy and Alex, and Tump and Poke at the laundromat. I got my clothes washed by a machine, and they are cleaner than they have been in a long while. We then went to check in at Elmer's Sunnybank Hostel. The hostel is in the oldest building in Hot Springs at 170 years old.  It is full of history. We slept in the room next to where Earl Schaffer stayed in 1948 when he was in the process of completing the first thru hike. 50 years later, at the age of 80, he stayed there again for his second thru hike. We had a great conversation with Elmer about the building and about hiking in general. Stephen and I hung my tent out in the back yard and for the first time in a long time, everything is dry. We then organized everything back in the room in preparation for hiking out tomorrow. We ran a few errands and then met a bunch of hiking buddies at the tavern for dinner.  We ate with Alex, Dapper Dan, Kevin, Billy, Reed, Monty, Trail Mix, Nate, and Jose.

We were up early and ate breakfast in our room. We were on the trail by 7:00. We knew we needed an early start, because this would be our longest day together: 16.3 miles. The trail out of Hot Springs was rocky and challenging. We gained over 1,300 feet in altitude in five miles. We did enjoy some great views of Hot Springs. It's a wonderful trail town, and we both had a tremendous time there. The hike today was tough, and Stephen did a great job, especially since it was his first day. There were many very steep climbs today. One was up to the Rich Mountain Lookout Tower. Stephen and I hiked up the access trail to look at it. We climbed it as far as we could but there weren""t any views to speak of. We thought we would eat lunch at the Spring Mountain Shelter, but it was tiny and full and facing the sun. We both made use of the tiny little privy there. It is the smallest privy I have seen on the trail, but it served its purpose well. We ended up eating lunch sitting on a log in a shady niche in the woods. It was a much better place. The hike today to Log Cabin Road was tough, and, like I said, Stephen did very well. We called ahead for a shuttle to pick us up at the trail junction with Log Cabin Road to take us to the Hemlock Hollow Hostel, but I was only able to leave a message. We got to the junction a full 30 minutes early and found there was no phone service. We decided to walk the 0.7 miles to the hostel. So, Stephen actually hiked a full 17 miles today.  The staff and hikers at the hostel were greatly impressed (and rightfully so).  Stephen and I enjoyed a large pizza apiece and two Gatorades.

In fact, I slept in until 5:15, a full hour longer than usual. Since we didn't have to worry about the tent, Stephen and I were still ready to go before 7:00. We headed up to the main office where we chatted again with the owner, Diana, and thanked her for her hospitality. While I was uploading two journal entries  (I continue having difficulty with a lot of the changes to trail journals, especially with photos) I am still trying to get my journal texts uploaded.  Hopefully, all of the glitches will be worked out soon. While I was working with that, Stephen surprised me with a Jimmy Dean's Sausage Biscuit and a Honey Bun. We left our oatmeal packets in the Hiker Box along with last night's pasta sides. No sense carrying the weight of excess food.  A nice young woman from the hostel have us a ride back to where the AT intersects Log Cabin Road. Our plan was to hike to Jerry Cabin Shelter, a distance of 10.7 miles. Yesterday had been tough hiking, and we planned on a short day today. We began with a pretty tough climb of nearly 2,000 vertical feet over our first five miles. The weather was blustery and windy with some occasional light drizzle. We made good time until we reached the Big Firescald Knob area. Were we ever met with a surprise. Apparently a few years ago, a new, extremely strenuous section was added to the AT in this area. The old section remains as an alternative route, especially for bad weather. It was only raining a little, and Stephen and I opted for the new, strenuous route. Are we ever glad we did. It was crazy hiking over these huge rocks and exposed rock faces. The ingenuity and skill that went into creating this trail is beyond belief. We were scrambling over huge rocks and climbing up and down huge rock staircases. The trail was 1.5 miles long, but I can't say how long it took us. To make matters more interesting, a heavy rain and wind picked up while we were out there. It paused long enough for Dapper Dan, who we met at the peak, to take our picture by the plaque commemorating the creator of the trail. This is the only photo of this section, because the weather didn't allow us to have our phones out the rest of the time. After this adventure, we made it to Jerry Cabin Shelter at 3:00. We had intended to stay, but the weather cleared while we were eating lunch, and we both decided we felt good enough to continue on. Most of the ""tramily"" were staying at Flint Mountain Shelter, but that was still another 6.7 miles away. We decided to hike on until we found a suitable stealth campsite (an unofficial place to set up camp along the trail).  We had a wonderful hike. After a relatively steep climb of nearly 1,000 feet over two miles, the trail became much easier. We hiked through a beautiful bald (an area in the top of a ridge with no trees) and through wonderfully green forests. The sun was shining, and we had great views of sun and shade on distant mountains (unfortunately, the trees in the way make for poor photos of these scenes).  The trail was good, and we made good time. We made it to the Flint Mountain camp area at 7:15, but we were both kind of sad the daily hike was over. Alex, Dapper, Reed, Kevin, Trail Mix, and Nate were all here. The only ones missing were Billy and Money. Stephen and I found a pretty flat spot for the tent and set up camp. We joined the others and cooked dinner. After hanging the food bags and getting water, we headed for bed. I was used to having the whole tent to myself, but we didn't have any trouble organizing it for two. It is now a bit before midnight and a strong wind is blowing, but I am snug and warm in my bag. The weather is supposed to be nice tomorrow.  Stephen and I plan on hiking fifteen miles  to Low Gap campsite, which is a more primitive campsite.  Stephen is definitely getting a microchasm look at the AT, with lots of examples of trail conditions, weather conditions, and camping/sleeping options. It was a great day.","Log Cabin Road/Hemlock Hollow Hostel

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563029,"Today's hike can be summed up in one word: steep. Since we came 6.7 miles further than planned yesterday,  we consulted the guide book and decided today's destination would be the Low Gap campsite. We both slept well and didn't wake up until 5:15. We got everything packed up and hit the trail at 7:00 for a day with ""only"" 14.9 miles on the agenda. The day started easily enough with a three mile hike to Devil Fork Gap. We then hiked to the top of Lick Rock Mountain (one must wonder where some of these names come from. There was a large rock atop the mountain but neither Stephen nor I were in the least bit tempted to lick it).  The hike to the top required a gain of 1,500 vertical feet over three miles.  A large part of the way we walked along a picturesque stream that features numerous waterfalls. The route was beautiful and very, very steep. We then hiked to Rice Gap which went just as steeply down. We took our time because this can be very hard on the knees and toes (since your toes get scrunched into the front of your shoes).  Likewise, walking uphill can be hard on your heels, and Stephen encountered his first blister on the back of his heel. He applied KT tape and hiked on. We got water and ate lunch at Hogback Ridge Shelter. Hogback Ridge is aptly named, as it consists of many (innumerable?) steep up and downs. Hogback Ridge Shelter also may boast of the privy with the greatest  view on the AT. There is no door (the privy is a bit of a walk from the shelter and faces away from it). The seat is quite low and a board thoughtfully provided for your feet is quite high, so you sit with your knees up by your chin. But the view of the mountains is amazing!  One might be tempted to pass the day away in quiet reflection if there weren't more hiking to be done. After leaving the shelter, we completed Hogback Ridge and were treated to a gorgeous view atop High Rock, where we met a really cool dog named Hobbs and his two humans. They had day hiked to the summit from a cabin. We then hiked down to Sam's Gap and walked under US 23/I-26, right at the Tennessee border. From there we climbed a very steep  hill (perhaps those who laid out the AT feel that switchbacks are for sissies).  We were rewarded with fantastic  views from the meadow at the top. We arrived at the Low Gap campsite at 6:15. We were both pretty beat from the day but quickly got camp set up and supper cooked. For the first time in awhile it was necessary to hang our food from a rope, since there weren't any bear cables. I was excited to meet up with Sam and Martin, whom I hadn't seen in many days. We shared the campsite with Leap Frog and Extra Mile, Waffle, Lion, and a few other thru hikers. As Stephen and I were both pretty wore out, we went to bed early.  We plan for a 14.6 mile day tomorrow and expect to camp at No Business Knob Shelter. We'll start the day with a climb to the top of Big Bald Mountain where we expect great views (and, probably, few switchbacks).","Flint Mountain Shelter

I have added text for the following dates:  4/20, 4/21, 4/22, 5/1, and 5/2. I hope to be adding photos again soon. I believe this will be the new norm because of service issues along the trail. Thanks!
Stephen and I both slept well again and didn't wake up until 5:30. We broke camp and were on trail by 7:20. We were first met by a three mile ascent to Big Bald Mountain, gaining over 1,000 feet in elevation. Unlike yesterday's ascents, which somehow felt like PUDs (an AT term meaning ""Pointless Ups and Downs), this ascent was challenging but fun. For one thing, we could see Big Bald Mountain looming in front of us so we knew where we were headed. We left tree line and entered the bald area and were absolutely blown away by the view. We had a 360 degree perspective of mountains as far as you could see. We could see roads and houses in the distance and layer upon layer of mountains. We spent over 30 minutes admiring the view and were undisturbed by any other hikers. We set a bit of Beau free before we left by hiking off the peak and then along Big Stamp, a long treeless saddle that followed the ridge line. We saw many birds, including a hawk. We then dropped elevation until heading up Little Bald Mountain, which, despite its name, is  tree  covered and afforded us no views. The climb up was intense but short. We then descended about 1,500 feet to Whistling Gap. There are campsites here, and my original plan was for us to stay here.  I'm glad things worked out otherwise, because it was not nearly as nice as Low Gap had been. We then hiked back upward, this time to High Rocks. We took off our packs near the top and took the blue blazed trail to the top of the rock. It required some rock scrambling, but it was well worth the effort to be able to stand on this huge rock with another stunning view. Many hikers forgo the blue blazed trails since they are not officially part of the AT, but my thought is that I will probably be this way only once, and I want to experience as much as I can. We walked/crawled back down the rocks to the AT, retrieved our packs, and began the long descent to Spivey Gap, where the AT crosses Highway 19W. There was a sign on the south side of the road announcing that the trail is maintained by the North Carolina AT hiking club and a sign on the north side staying that this responsibility was now shouldered by the Tennessee AT hiking club. Our reintroduction to Tennessee consisted of a tremendously steep climb out of Spivey Gap following a beautiful stream. The trail crossed the stream on two different foot bridges. At the top of the climb, by the headwaters of the stream, we stopped for a late lunch. Powered by Spam and MRE Cheese Burritos, Stephen and I completed the last three miles of our day and arrived at the shelter area at No Business Knob (again, the names of some of the places we have been).  We set up camp and prepared supper. We only have 6.2 miles to go to reach Erwin tomorrow, and we plan on a very early start. Since we will be there before lunch, Stephen opted to eat tomorrow's lunch for supper tonight. His reasoning was sound. He didn't have to cook, lunches weigh more so his pack would be lighter tomorrow, and, after all, who can go wrong with two Spam burritos in one day? I decided to cook up my pouched rice meal but, who knows, a Spam burrito for breakfast sounds pretty yummy. We plan on a ""nero"" tomorrow (a near zero, since we will only be hiking 6.2 miles) and should be in Erwin before noon. We will then get a shuttle back to Hot Springs to retrieve Stephen's car. The trip to Hot Springs takes about 40 minutes by car/five days by foot. Then it's off to Asheville to meet Stephen's friend Chance. We will spend the night in a hotel in Asheville. On Friday we will return to Erwin, and Stephen will head home and I will continue my journey northward to Maine.  Some of the news of the devastating floods back home have reached me.  My prayers are with every one in Missouri who has been affected by this tragedy. It seems truly unprecedented.","Low Gap Campsite

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563123,"I have been able to catch up on all of my text journaling and have added many photos this evening. I think I have the new system figured out. Today's journal entry:I set an alarm last night for the first time.  We wanted to get into Erwin early to arrange for a shuttle to get us back to Stephen's car in Hot Springs. Rain is in the forecast, and we hoped to get to town before it began. Stephen also wanted to try hiking in the dark.  So we were up at 4:00 and on the trail by 5:50.  We hiked by headlamp for 30 minutes until the sun came up.  The 6.2 miles into Erwin were some of the easiest I have seen. The only ascent of any size followed an old forest road, so we made good time. There were beautiful views of both the town of Erwin and of the Nolichucky River as we drew near. We met Peregrine along the way. He is an Eagle Scout from Maryland who worked on staff for three summers at Philmont Scout Reservation. We took turns posing for and taking photos at the overlook site. We made excellent time and made it to Nolichucky Johnny's Hostel by 9:15. We arranged for an 11:00 shuttle with Shuttles by Tom and spent our waiting time relaxing at the hostel's common area. Marie, our driver, was very knowledgeable about hiking in general and the AT in specific  (she is a section hiker and her husband is a triple crowner) and the forty-five minute drive went by quickly. Yes, five days to walk it (over numerous mountains, of course) and forty-five minutes to drive it.  We got back to Hot Springs and drove to Asheville  to meet Stephen's friend, Chance, who we helped celebrate his birthday, his graduation from culinary school, and his job finding (as a chef at Sea World in Orlando) all in one go.  Chance is lucky to have been born on Star Wars Appreciation Day: May the Fourth be with you.  We relaxed at the hotel for awhile, eating the Taco Bell that Chance brought and doing my laundry.  After this, we went to several craft brew pubs and ate dinner at the Foggy Mountain Pub, where I broke with tradition.  Instead of a cheese burger and fries, I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and fries. We enjoyed time at the Foggy Mountain Pub, the Twin Leaf, the Burial Brewery, and Wicked Weed's Funcatorium (sour beers).  While we were there, we learned that Wicked Weed was bought out by AB just yesterday. Sigh.  I was able to talk to Becky, Sandy, and my mom since I finally had good phone service. I learned more about the intense flooding at home. I also contacted Lillian at school and learned that all of our students and their families are safe. We returned to the hotel before deciding that perhaps a trip to Waffle House was in the cards. I had two eggs, a buscuit, hash browns  (covered, smothered, and capped), and a waffle. Ah, hiker hunger. We returned to the hotel where I worked on catching up on my journal. It began raining in the early evening.  I was admittedly glad to not be in my tent. I'll return to Erwin tomorrow and will either head back on the trail in the afternoon or take a zero at the hostel and strike out on Saturday. Stephen drives home tomorrow. It has been a wonderful experience hiking together this past week. My daughter, Becky, plans on joining me for a week further down the trail, probably in Vermont. It's early morning (4:00) as I write this, and I'll wrap this up to get a few more hours sleep. Rumor has it we are going to a Biscuit breakfast shop that offers a flight of their favorite gravies. Oh, and the hotel offers a continental breakfast beginning at 6:30.  Ah, hiker hunger.","No Business Knob Shelter

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563319,"It's amazing to me the amount of change one can experience in a twenty-four hour period. Last night I was in a very nice hotel (thank you, Stephen!) and tonight I am snuggled up in my sleeping bag with a single sheet of cuben fiber between me and a very windy and cold rain storm (thank you, Tent!).  Armed with strong Wi-Fi and a fully charged phone, I  spent over an hour early this morning updating my journal. At the time I left the hotel, all my entries were up to date, and I had uploaded a good number of photos, some dating back to over a week ago. We all slept in until 7:00 and then got ready to leave the hotel to have breakfast at a biscuit restaurant that Stephen and Chance had gone to the last time they were in Asheville. The food was phenomenal. I had the three biscuit and gravy flight and was able to choose three of their gravies. I chose mushroom medley, a red eye gravy (that was very savory), and the gravy of the day, which was bacon, sausage, and two cheeses. For good measure, I also had two sunny side up eggs and coffee. After breakfast, we said goodbye to Chance and headed back to the hotel. We finished packing up, checked out, and headed to REI for a few things I needed. I decided to purchase a new pair of Super Feet insoles which proved to be a very good move. The balls of my feet felt so much better today. I'm thinking I may be able to get through a third of the trail with my first pair of shoes which are, knock on wood, holding up well with little signs of wear. Inserts will be replaced more often. Significantly, the blister on my toe didn't bother me at all today.  After REI, we drove back to Uncle Johnny's Hostel. Uncle Johnny has written his autobiography, and he was kind enough to autograph my copy, which I sent home with Stephen. Something to look forward to reading when I get home. My original plan was to zero at the hostel.  We got there a little shy of noon, and it seemed awfully early to call it a day. I really wanted to get back on the trail. The weather forecast was not promising, with a call for rain, cold, and wind. I figure you can't always hike in ""good"" weather, and I oftentimes prefer cool weather to hot for hiking. I opted to head out at least to the next shelter which was 4.3 miles away. I started by crossing the Nolichucky River. What a difference a day (and substantial rainfall can make).  Yesterday, the river flowed calmly and blue. Today, it raged along looking brown with white caps. I felt rested and ready and made good time. The trail was somewhat steeply up as I left the Nolichucky valley. There were several very nice footbridges, one of which was an Eagle Scout project. When I reached Curley Maple Gap Shelter, I had a decision to make. The weather still held off, but did I want to hike on or hunker down in the shelter and wait for it. I figure I'm not carrying all of this inclement weather gear for nothing, so I decided to continue on. Besides, it seems to me you can stay warmer in a tent than in a three sided, wooden structure.  I motored on, hoping to make it to a good campsite area I had heard about which was eight miles further on. The trail was typically AT, with lots of ups and downs,  some of them steep. It began to rain at 5:00, but it.was not windy and not so cold that I felt the need of my rain jacket. I hiked in an intermittent rain until I made it in very good time to my destination of choice. There were some very flat spots along an old road, but I opted for a slightly less flat spot down a hill, as I figured it would be more sheltered from the wind. The wind picked up and the temperature started to drop as I arrived. I changed into a dry shirt, put on my rain jacket, and set up camp. I cooked supper and hung the bear bag in a tree before settling in for the night. The storm began in earnest as the sun went down. My thermometer read 35 degrees when I went to bed. I'm quite toasty in my bag, although I am wearing my puffy jacket and stocking cap. As usual, I slept for about 1 1/2 hours before waking up. It is presently 12:30, and the temperature in the tent has actually gone up to forty degrees. It is far colder outside. The storm is pretty intense.  I am listening to very strong winds but, as I hoped, they are.pretty much going over the top of my tent. I am dry and toasty warm now, and I don't know what tomorrow might hold. I don't feel it would be wise to venture out in this storm, so I may just hunker down and wait it out. After all, I do have my mp3 player that I have yet to use. I have Bruce Springsteen's book, Born to Run, on audio books. Maybe tomorrow will be a good time to listen to ""The Boss.""  I have food, water, and shelter, so I am in fine shape. I'm going to put my gloves back on and go back to sleep.  Another day in the adventure.","Erwin, Tennessee (Asheville by car)

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563386,"I slept very well and woke several times to the sound of rain on the tent and strong wind in the trees.  I have no doubt that I have the equipment and ability to hike in this weather today, but the question that begs itself is, ""Why?"" The latest forecast I have is that tomorrow is supposed to be sunny and in the fifties. I checked my guide book, and I can make it to the Elk Park hostel  with plenty of food, even with an extra day off.  Along the way to Elk Park, I want to sleep at the Roan High Knob Shelter for two reasons. One, because it is the highest shelter on the AT and, two, because of its ties with the railroad that I model. Many years ago while attending an annual ET&WNC RR convention, we drove to the top of Roan Mountain to see the ruins of the Cloudland Hotel. We also came across the AT as it crosses the area near there. I should be there in two days of hiking, and then it is 16.3 miles from there to the Mountain Harbor Hiker Hostel near Elk Park, which was also a town served by my railroad, as well as my next scheduled resupply point. I've spent a very serene, restful day so far. The temperature has actually dropped during the day. It is now mid-afternoon, and my thermometer checks out at just under 30 degrees. The winds have abated somewhat but are still quite strong. I've listened to the first five chapters of Born to Run, and it is quite good. The only time I have ventured from my tent was around 2:00. Armed with my trusty trowel and toilet paper, I ventured out to do my ""woodsly"" business. I also retrieved my food bag but left the rope, as I will go back out this evening to hang it back up. I wore my rain pants and jacket and put my feet inside the two plastic grocery bags I carry for this purpose and returned to my tent as dry as when I left. The woods look very impressive in a dark, misty, wet kind of way. I ate a clif bar, a beef and cheese slim jim, and a peanut butter packet. I in no way felt hungry, but I know I still need to eat. It is presently 3:30 and the wind and rain are kicking up the intensity.  In fact, I just looked out of the tent, and it is snowing!  I'll finish the rest of this entry tonight.  It's now evening, and I am settling in to go to sleep. I just finished hanging the bear bag back in the tree. The rain has stopped. My plan is to head for the Clyde Smith Shelter tomorrow, which is 13.9 miles away. Lots of ups and downs, but the only major one is Unaka Mountain which I will encounter first thing in the morning.  The next day, I will only need to go 8.5 miles to get to Roan Mountain and will be over 6,000 feet again.  It is 6,212 feet at the summit. The shelter is at 6,193 feet. It's been quite a day, and I really look forward to getting back to hiking tomorrow. If nothing else, I am well rested.","Unnamed Campsite at Mile 355.0

Stick in the Woods,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563631,"Well, today I have been one month on the trail. It's amazing how fast the time has gone. I woke up at 5:15 to 35 degrees but no rain. I was on the trail at 7:15. The hike up Unaka Mountain was steep, misty, and wet until I got near the top. The sun started to cut through the mist at the same time I got to the snow. Unaka is covered in a heavy spruce forest, and it was like a winter wonderland. Usually we think of Trail Magic as people giving us food, but the hike across the top of Unaka Mountain was true trail magic. I came across a very touching scene. A family has decorated one of the spruce trees as a perpetual Christmas tree in honor of their late son. I left a note in the register and plan on finding more about the story when I get home.  At the summit, I met Shepherd from Australia. He is completing his triple crown (Pacific Crest, Continental Divide, and Appalachian Trails).  Considering his pace, I doubt I'll ever see him again, but we spent time together sharing the awesome winter views and taking each other's photos.  The rest of the day went very well. It stayed cold for awhile, which suited me just fine. I ate lunch in a pretty little glen.  I only planned on 13.9 miles today, so I was in no hurry. I got to camp at 4:30 and had plenty of time to dry out a few things, do all my camp chores, and visit around the fire with other hikers. Tomorrow will be short miles, since I will definitely be staying on Roan Mountain. It will be quite a climb, going up 2,200 feet over 4.4 miles, but I have all day, and the total mileage for the day is 8.5. I am now hiking in ""Tweetsie Country"" where the railroad that I model used to run. It will be very nostalgic to be on top of Roan Mountain again, as we have been there before in conjunction with the railroad. Of course, that time we drove to the top. Tomorrow I get to walk there.
Note: For anyone keeping track, I noticed my trip mile number is not correct. I'll have to check the entries to see where the problem lies.  For now, I'll just put the correct mileage in my entry.

Clyde Smith Shelter to Overmountain Shelter 16.3 milesTotal miles: 384.5
Today was a day of contrasts. I woke up a little late and was not ready to leave camp until 7:40. Since I only planned on going the 8.5 miles to the shelter on Roan Mountain, this certainly didn't matter. The first six miles went very smoothly. Although the ascent up Roan was steep, the trail was smooth and well graded. The last two miles from Ash Gap to the summit more than made up for that. The AT showed what it can be over 6,000 feet. The trail was muddy, rocky, and very icy. The snow from the other day had become ice. The heavy spruce forest was very dark. I slowly made my way to the summit and visited the site of the Cloudland Hotel, which Sandy and I had visited thirty years before on our first trip to the area studying the railroad. My plan was to eat lunch there, but it was very cold and windy, so I continued on to the shelter.  The trail to the shelter was also very icy, and it was bitterly cold there. The shelter is built of logs and, unlike most shelters, is closed on all four sides.  It is actually a log cabin. Monty, Jose, and I ate lunch there, but it was so cold we could see our breath. I decided to move on to lower and warmer places. Several miles of the trail leaving the shelter were on the old coach road that ran from the town of Roan Mountain to the  Cloudland. What a ride those folks must have had. It was very rocky, rough, and curving. As we lost altitude, the snow disappeared and it became warmer. We then reached Carvers Gap, and it was like we were on another world. The sun was shining, and the trail that led up to Round Bald was four feet wide and paved in chat. The views from the bald were spectacular.  Dozens of people were on the bald, including a young woman doing yoga for a photographer with the mountains in the background. It was amazing that such different conditions existed within just 1.5 miles of each other. The trail that led to Jane Bald was quite a bit rougher, and there were far fewer people enjoying those views.  I hiked across the balds with Dutch.  This is the second time we've hiked together.  He is very thoughtful and insightful, and I very much enjoy hiking with him.  The last bald, Grassy Ridge Bald, required an extra half mile side hike off of the AT, and I had that summit all to myself. At the top of the bald, with the wind literally hissing through the trees below, away from even the beaten path of the AT, I set a bit of Beau free. I think he would have liked that.  The trail to Overmountain Shelter  was not difficult, and I arrived a bit after six. The shelter is converted from a large, old barn and could easily sleep over 30 hikers. I set up tent up in the grassy area near the barn and shared a campfire and dinner with Monty, Jose, Nathan, Legs, and several other hikers. I have a 9.2 mile hike tomorrow to the Mountain Harbor Hiker Hostel near Elk Park, where I will resupply and probably stay the night. I plan on getting an early start in the morning.  Rain is in the forecast, and I hope I can beat it to the hostel.","Clyde Smith Shelter

Today was a day of surprises and a little bit of adventure. As predicted, the rain began around 2:00 am and continued steadily until about 4:00. I got up at 4:15, expecting to get an early start to make it to the hostel, 9.2 miles away. The rain had stopped, and I was ready earlier than I expected, so I decided to hike out in the dark. True to form, I missed the turn off to the return trail, and by the time I got things sorted out, daylight had arrived. This was for the best, since I had a wonderful view of the shelter as I climbed away from it. The rain started again in earnest at about 7:00. Crossing over Hump Mountain was an incredible adventure. Hump is actually a bald, and the rain and wind were so intense that I oftentimes had to stop, dig my trekking poles in, lean into the wind, and try not to get blown over. It may have been the most intense hiking of my life. The contrast to yesterday's balds was complete. Yesterday, my views were of distant mountains. This morning, my view consisted of what I could see of the four feet in front of me with my right eye. The gusting wind blew the hood of my rain jacket over my left eye. I had to hold my hood to look up to keep the wind from blowing it back and risking losing my hat. My visibility was often no more than 15-20 feet. I talked to one hiker who doesn't use poles, and he told me he was blown over by the wind five times. Immediately after cresting the summit, the wind largely abated, and the rain slackened soon after. The rest of the hike to 19E was muddy and slippery, but nothing really unusual.  I arrived at the highway a little before noon.  My plan was to hike the 0.3 miles to a hostel, but Dave from Doe River Hiker Rest Hostel was there handing out trail magic (sandwiches and oranges).  He offered me a shuttle ride to his hostel near Roan Mountain. The deal was too good to pass up. Imagine my surprise and delight when I learned that his hostel is located on Old Railroad Grade Road, right along the old right of way of my railroad. Every time we are in the area, my family and I always drive down Old Railroad Grade Road to get a bit of the feeling of what it was like to ride the train.  In places, the cuts are so narrow that a car can barely get through.  It's a wonder how the train fit. Dave is a most gracious host, and I have had a wonderful, restful day today. A group of us drove into Roan Mountain for wood-fired pizza at the  Smoky Mountain Bakers. I ate a delicious pizza with Ribbons, Mountain Goat, Jaba, and Buck. Buck and Jaba are a father and son team. Ribbons is thru hiking with her husband and their five children.  Mountain Goat is from Germany. After eating, we went to the local grocery to resupply. I now have enough food to get me to Damascus, which I plan on reaching in five, maybe six, days. Tonight, I enjoyed visiting with fellow hikers and with Jax and Hazel, the hostel's two dogs. I have everything just about ready and will get an early shuttle back to 19E to resume my hike. Today was truly a surprise-filled, adventurous, and wonderful day.","Overmountain Shelter

If the past few days have been a study of contrasts, today was the opposite. The weather was beautiful all day, sunny yet cool.  There were no major ascents or descents. Don't get me wrong, the entire day was spent either going up or going down;  there is very little flat on the AT in the southern Appalachians, but except for an early hike up Buck Mountain, today was a minor roller coaster of a day. I slept very well at the hostel and didn't get up until 6:15. Since everything was already packed the night before, I was still ready for a morning shuttle ride back to 19E by a little after 7:00. I cannot say enough good things about Dave and his Doe River Hiker Rest Hostel.  I met hikers today who said he gave them free sodas and a free ride into town even though they didn't stay at his hostel. Through my own fault, however, I was almost robbed of one of my most crucial and irreplaceable objects. There is a clear warning on the door to the hostel to never leave anything on the back porch or it will surely disappear. This morning, almost ready to go, I set my hiking shoes, which had spent the night on the wooden upstairs floor, on the back porch since I didn't want to get any dirt on the kitchen floor. A few minutes later, I hear scratching at the back door and open it to find Jax, Hazel, and a new dog at the door. I told Dave that I hadn't met the third dog and he said, ""That's Elvis. He's why we never leave anything on the porch.""  I looked out, and the rascal already had one of my shoes in his mouth, ready to abscond with his ill-gotten gain. I stopped him in the act, although he showed no remorse. He is a very friendly dog with hoarding issues. Losing my shoe would have been extremely serious, but I wouldn't have had anyone to blame but myself, as the warning was clear. I was back on the trail, fully shod, by 7:45. The hike up Buck Mountain yielded beautiful views. It was great weather for hiking, and I made good progress.  Most of the day was through woods.  I took the side trail to see Jones Falls, which was very impressive.  I also walked for a few miles along the Elk River, which looked large enough for canoeing. I did pass two milestones. I forgot to mention yesterday that at Doll Flats (mile 390.7) I said goodbye to North Carolina. Today, I passed the 400 mile mark. I shared time with some very special people today.  Rick and Kevin are volunteer trail maintainers with the Eastman Hiking and Canoeing Club. They were armed with a chain saw and loppers and were clearing the trail of some recent tree falls. Kevin is a past thru hiker.  We spent quite awhile discussing trail maintenance and hiking in general. I also had an interesting chat with Michael at the Mountaineer Shelter, where I was eating lunch. He plans to thru hike in two years, after he retires and his son, who is a Navy Seal, leaves active duty. He gave me a warning about a confusing trail junction I would come to and left an arrow for me as he return hiked back to his car.  Today was also a day of reuinions. I saw Cow Girl, who I hadn't seen since week one. I also saw Katie Robo-Knee, who I haven't seen since we hiked together the first day in the Smokies. We camped together in the tent area of Moreland Camp Shelter along with Dutch. I ended up hiking a long way today (my second longest day) since the weather was good, the trail was reasonable, and I will need to get near Hampton tommorow. The four miles of trail between Hampton (Highway US 321) and Wilbur Dam Road  (which includes Watauga Dam) are closed to camping due to bear activity. I'll either stop before or after that section, depending on how I feel. Considering I did over 18 miles today, it will probably be before. It's a cool evening with a beautiful moon, and it's time for this hiker to go to bed. More adventures tomorrow.

I guess I was pretty tuckered out by the 18.4 miles yesterday, because I didn't wake up until 6:15.  I hit the trail at 7:30. I knew I couldn't make it the 24 miles to the next shelter, and the area around Watauga Dam is closed to camping due to bear activity. Dave, from Doe River Hiker Hostel, had recommended Boots Off Hostel, but the guidebook didn't list where it was located. I really wanted to hike over Pond Mountain today, so I decided to try to call Boots Off during the day to see where they were located and if I could get there from the trail. While hiking this morning, I asked Redwood what his plans were, and he told me he was staying at Boots Off.  He then told me they were located only 0.1 miles from the trail after you are finished with Pond Mountain. Problem solved!  Today was quite a hike. The morning at first consisted of pretty typical woods hiking. I passed an old, dilapidated barn just before Dennis Cove Road. At the road, I met Yard Dart, who was passing out trail magic in the form of cheese sandwiches, fresh fruit, cupcakes, and drinks. In fact, I had met him at Highway 19E but hadn't heard his story. He and his wife, Miss Bonnie, began a thru hike last month. He injured his calf and is unable to hike. So he is following Miss Bonnie, providing trail magic to all hikers he can, all the way to Maine. Apparently, Miss Bonnie is a slow hiker, so I might be benefiting from Yard Dart's generosity for months!  After leaving Dennis Cove Road, I began the hike to Laurel Falls. The trail to the Falls consisted of hundreds of irregular stone steps that lead steeply down to the falls. It was very slow, difficult hiking, and I was again thankful for my trekking poles in case I slipped. The Falls are huge and simply amazing. I spent some time there just watching the sheer amount of water cascading down the falls. The Laurel River is quite deep and wide at this point, and the trail away from the falls began with a walk right along the base of the bluffs, mere inches from the water. It was quite a scramble. Another hiker asked if I saw the size of the fish, and I responded that I had been too busy trying not to fall in. After leaving the falls, I ate lunch near a large foot bridge over the Laurel River and then commenced the hike up Pond Mountain. Pond is classic AT.  It consists of a 1,750 foot change in elevation accomplished by a 2.6 mile walk up followed immediately by a 2.8 mile walk down. It was a relatively challenging climb with lots of rocks and steep trail. There were some nice views of the houses below, and I saw a cemetery way down in a valley that looked like the one I passed by yesterday. I'm not sure if it's the same one or not. Another sure sign that spring is advancing: the rhododendron are starting to bloom.  After reaching the road at the bottom of the mountain, sure enough there was a sign pointing to the Boots Off Hostel. Jim, the owner, is having issues with state licensing agencies over water issues, so no one is allowed to stay in the very nice bunk houses he has built. Instead, I pitched my tent on a nicely graded spot and went up to the kitchen area to visit with other hikers. Jim shuttled us into Hampton where we resupplied as necessary and then went to eat. I gave McDonald's a try and bought two Big Mac meals. I wasn't greedy, though. I told the cashier I only needed one cup. We all got take out and ate around a campfire back at the hostel. There was a big fire, and we all had a good time. I was one of the first to decide to call it a night around 10:00, when it started to rain. That sent everyone to their tents. It thundered for awhile before settling into a steady rain, which is forecast to last two days. It looks like I'll have some wet hiking into Damascus, which I plan on reaching in three days. Jim provides a free continental breakfast starting at 7:00 tomorrow morning, of which I will certainly take advantage. I really hope he is able to work out his issues with the state soon, because he is building up quite a place with great accessibility to the trail.","Moreland Gap Shelter

I woke up at 6:15 to find that the rain had stopped during the night. I packed everything up and headed for the kitchen area of the hostel for the free continental breakfast. I couldn't resist a very yummy egg and sausage biscuit that set me back  $3.00. My total bill for staying at the hostel: $13.00. I lingered for quite a while, and I didn't head out on the trail until 9:15. Cow Girl, Anvil, Pirate, and Knight Rider decided they were going to slackpack all the way to Damascus today. Slackpacking is an option made available by many hostels. They will either drive you to a location north of the hostel and then you hike back or, like in today's case, the hostel will transport your pack to a forward location. That way, the hiker only carries a day pack for the day and is freed from the weight of a full pack. It is a fairly common occurrence on the AT, but a practice that I haven't felt an urge to do. Either way, 40 miles is a very long distance to try to cover in one day. I was happy to settle with my 16 miles. I hope they made it okay, because the weather turned challenging this afternoon. I started my hike along Watauga Lake and soon entered the area off limits to camping, picnicking, or ""lingering,"" due to bear activity in the area. I kept my eyes wide open but didn't see a bear.  There were nice views of the lake, however. After about four miles, I crossed the Watauga Dam and then returned to the woods. The hiking was uneventful until the rain started back up at 2:00. I made it to Vandeventer Shelter by 2:30, just as the rain really  picked up. As I ate my lunch, however, the rain slackened and then quit. I headed out for Iron Mountain Shelter, 6.7 miles away. The rain began again in earnest at 5:00, and this time there was thunderstorm activity. I was as safe as I could be with a good stand of trees surrounding me.  Still, I was a bit nervous, and I made the last three miles in not quite one hour. I met Monty, Jose, and Angela in the shelter. I had planned on staying in the shelter, but Yeti and Hugable also made it here, and I started watching all of the mice running around in the shelter. The rain quit for a bit, so I set up my tent. It is presently pouring outside, although no thunderstorm activity. I have managed to keep most everything at least relatively dry. The rain is supposed to quit tomorrow morning with sunshine by afternoon. I plan on hiking to Abingdon Gap Shelter tomorrow  (15.9 miles) and then a short hike of only ten miles into Damascus, Virginia on Sunday.  
Note:  I realized today that I am now over 20% complete with my thru hike. It is said that the AT is a journey of five million steps, so that means I have hiked over one million steps. Perhaps I should have worn a Fitbit . . .","Shook Branch Road/Boots Off Hostel

Iron Mountain Shelter to Abingdon Gap Shelter 15.9 milesTotal miles:  458.8
I woke this morning to the chirping of birds and the sound of no rain hitting the tent (which was a silent and welcome ""sound"" indeed!).  I woke up at 6:15 and was on the trail at 7:50.  The topographic lines in the guidebook today were deceptive. Since there were no tall mountains to climb, it made the 15.9 miles look like it would be an easy day.  The reality is that there were literally dozens of relatively short, but still very steep, up and downs all day long. As I passed one hiker who was taking a break on a particularly steep incline, he shook his head and said, ""There just aren't any easy days.""  Still, the weather was much better than yesterday with a cold, misty morning followed by a sunny afternoon.  The trail, while undulating, was relatively free of large rocks and challenging scrambles.  I tripped over several roots and stobs today, but only a few times more than normal. Today was a bit of what is called ""the green tunnel.""  No real views, but the woods are very green and beautiful. I came across the most curious monument. At mile 444.2, there is the large stone monument/grave of Nick Grinstaff.  The epitaph on the monument reads:
Uncle Nick GrindstaffBorn Dec. 26, 1851Died July 22, 1923
Lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone. 
He was also buried alone.  Uncle Nick is now visited by hundreds of hikers every year in his location far from any sign of civilization. Perhaps placed here by disgruntled nephew, I plan on trying to discover the back story to this when I get home.  The trail led downward from here to a very boggy, wet area.  Here, the AT consists of a series of many footbridges set above the bog.  From there, the trail crosses Highway 91 and enters the Osbourn Farm. Here, for .5 miles, the AT is a fully disability-accessible trail. There is a ramp with a gate that opens onto a graded, wheelchair accessible trail through the farm. I am pleased to see that at least a small portion of the AT is open to people with severe mobility issues. Just past this section, I had to climb over a fence via a ladder and got to walk right through a herd of cows. I talked calmly to a mother cow whose calf was feeding as I walked by, but none of the cows seemed to care a bit about my presence among them. I'm sure they are used to being disturbed by hikers. I made it to Double Spring Shelter and ate lunch with Jose. I would pass him several miles later as he paused for ""second lunch.""  Like me, he plans to resupply in Damascus tomorrow and decided that eating his extra food made more sense than carrying it.  At mile 457.3, I passed McQueens Knob Shelter, an old shelter that is listed as ""disused"" in the guidebook. It is very small and rundown, although I suppose you could stay there if you so desired. Just a mile past there is the much nicer Abingdon Gap Shelter, where I am spending tonight. I got here at 4:30 and set up camp. I set up my tent, ran a clothes line, and placed everything in the sun to dry. I weathered yesterday's storm pretty well, but everything gets damp after a rain like that. Angela, Monty, Jose, and I enjoyed a much sunnier, drier dinner than last night. Joining us was Pace, a young woman who started her thru hike back in early March. She suffered a broken foot and has been off the trail for four weeks. She is unsure if she will be able to resume her thru hike or do sections instead. I also met her father and her dog, Winston (a cute, little pug), who were with her at Low Gap, where she resumed her hike.  We had a great chat over dinner, and she is thrilled to be back on the trail. I got to bed early tonight and hope to get an early start into Damascus in the morning. I am less than seven miles to leaving Tennessee and entering Virginia, where the trail runs for 550 miles, nearly a quarter of its length. The weather is fair but cool, perfect sleeping weather.","Iron Mountain Shelter

I woke this morning at 6:20 after a very good night's sleep. I was ready to be on the trail around 7:30. Angela left at the same time, and we hiked together all the way to Damascus. We had a splendid conversation covering all kinds of topics, and the miles just melted away. Monty met up with us and joined in the conversation. We all three hiked together to the Tennessee/Virginia border. We were all surprised how quickly it ""showed up.""  It's amazing how quickly you can get to know someone on the trail.  The trail continued to fly by, and we were soon standing in front of the welcome arch at the border of Damascus. This town has the reputation as the friendliest trail town, and I can believe it. Angela had to confirm her shuttle back to her car at Standing Bear Farm. She had been section hiking and needs to be back at work in West Virginia tomorrow. She works in one of the parks; perhaps another potential future vacation destination for Sandy and me?  Many of the hostels in town are already filled with hikers who are eagerly awaiting Trail Days, which is next weekend. I may try to get a shuttle back for it. I'll have to wait and see. There was a vacancy at the Hiker Inn, and Lee, the very nice owner, showed me a room upstairs. She then took me out the back door to point out a short cut to the restaurant where I was meeting Angela.  That's when I saw it. An Air Stream trailer. Lee saw my eyes light up and told me I could stay in the trailer for the same cost as the room. That decision took nanoseconds.  After stowing my stuff in the Air Stream, I met Angela for lunch. She then headed for her shuttle, and I set about the business of resupply. Hiking the AT is really a series of relatively short hikes between resupply points. I took a shower in the Air Stream, dressed in my town clothes, and left my other clothes for Lee to wash (my socks honestly smelled like a swamp).  I purchased denatured alcohol (my stove fuel of choice) and Permethrin at the outfitters, along with a replacement water pouch for my filtration system (one of mine had split).  I then went to Dollar General to obtain five more days of food. There was only one Spam Single left on the shelf, along with three empty display boxes. The secret of Spam Singles is a secret no more. I had to settle with four days worth of pouched tuna. The sacrifices we make to hike the trail!  I carried my supplies back to the trailer, reapplied Permethrin to my tent, backpack, and clothing. We are getting close to tick season, and I don't want to take any chances. I then sorted through my food. Once again, my pack will be weighted down tomorrow for the hike out of Damascus. I then went back to the restaurant for supper (a Cuban sandwich with fries).  I returned to the hostel and visited with several hikers on the porch while I updated my journal. I will be hiking out tomorrow morning. I'm not sure how far I'll go. By getting into town early, I can fool myself into thinking I took a zero in town, since I got here so early today. I'll see how things go and decide down the trail about whether to return for Trail Days. It has been an eventful but mentally restful day. I'm anticipating a good sleep in the Air Stream and then back on the trail tomorrow. P.S.  Many thanks to Mr. David McCracken who included a link to Uncle Nick's Monument in the Guest Book to my journal. It is a fascinating read about a very interesting man.  Thank you, David!","Abingdon Gap Shelter

I woke up this morning in the Air Stream and started thinking about the possibility of taking a zero day.  I got up and began packing up and decided it was just too nice a day to not be hiking. I had purchased a piece of construction paper and a Sharpie yesterday, and I made a sign congratulating the two upcoming graduates from my school in Rolla.  I had tried to send a congratulations video without success. Lee took my picture holding the sign in front of the Air Stream. Monty and Jose stopped by to see if I wanted to go to breakfast. I watched them play a game of chess, and then we walked to Mojo's Coffeehouse for breakfast. We walked along the AT, which offered me a pleasant surprise after I started hiking after breakfast. By the time I got out of town and reentered the woods, I only had 14.5 miles left to hike, instead of the 15.8 I had expected. We had a great breakfast, and were joined by Spitfire, another thru hiker. It was 10:00 before I left Damascus, but I felt good and ready to hike. We actually got to hike on almost level ground for an entire mile today. The AT follows the Virginia Creeper Trail for 0.4 miles out of Damascus. The Creeper Trail is a Rails to Trails project and is very popular for bicycles.  It is about five feet wide and paved in chat. The AT meets up with the Creeper Trail two other times.  Once to bypass a damaged bridge on the AT, and once again for 0.4 miles near the end of today's hike.  Of course, the AT could share the Virginia Creeper Trail the entire distance of about ten miles, but instead it goes up and over Iron Mountain and any number of other steep up and downs getting from Point A to Point B in over twelve miles. Oh well, if it were easy it wouldn't be the AT. The trail was pretty normal. There were some pretty serious rock scrambles early on, a lot of steep up and downs, and a lot of rocky trail. We may be in Virginia, but the terrain still seems a lot like what we've hiked before. If course, this is only our first full day in Virginia. The rhododendron are more and more in bloom, which makes for pretty scenery. There were no real views today due to tree cover, but the weather was sunny and cool, and the mountains could be seen in the distance through the trees. I chose to hike a little extra today to get water and eat at Saunders Shelter, which is about 1/4 mile off the AT. It was a very nice shelter in beautiful surroundings, so I'm glad I stopped. I had been forewarned by Wild One, a hiker that I met hiking to the shelter, that the privy was overrun by bees. Fortunately, I was not in need of the privy, but I did notice a good number of bees around the shelter. I didn't get to Lost Mountain Shelter until nearly 7:00, but I was able to get all my chores done before dark. I plan on getting a far earlier start in the morning. It's a beautiful, cool evening that should provide excellent sleeping weather.","Damascus, Virginia

I woke up ready to face the world at 6:10. I have decided to not set an alarm unless absolutely necessary, since I figure I need the sleep I am naturally getting. It takes a while for my body to decompress from the day, particularly my feet. Keeping my pack underneath them has helped. I was on the trail by 7:30. If the past few days have been rather mundane, then today made up for that. I climbed my first mountain since Pond Mountain.  The climb up Whitecap Mountain involved a 2,000 foot elevation change spread over four miles. A good deal of it was rocky and steep, while a portion was a steady switchback. Climbing a mountain is different from the numerous up and downs of the past few days. One difference, of course, is that you keep going up for a long time. However, there are rewards. In the case of Whitecap, I was able to anticipate a wonderful view at the top, and I was not disappointed. You also get to see blue sky appear closer and closer through the trees as you near the summit. The vegetation changes as you climb as well.  Near the top, the trees are short and scruffy and look like they work hard for their living. Cool breezes often begin, and sometimes it gets downright windy. The trail often crosses the ridgeline as it climbs toward the summit, and the conditions can be markedly different based on the direction. There are usually lots of birds on the more open summits, which are fun to watch. I did observe a group of vultures wrangling over what looked like a dead fawn near the top of Mount Rogers today. I'm not sure you would call that fun. It was fascinating, however. After enjoying the tremendous views from Whitecap, I headed for Mount Rogers, the highest point in Virginia. At first, the ascent was pretty easy, since we hadn't descended that far from Whitecap. I was excited because I would be entering the Grayson Highlands soon after Mount Rogers, and I would be encountering the wild ponies that live there. As so often happens with the AT, the trail was in no hurry to allow that to happen. The final 1.5 miles of the ascent of Mount Rogers and the subsequent three miles descent through the Highlands is arguably the most difficult hiking I have encountered since Sassafras Mountain in Georgia and the new trail that Stephen and I hiked along the bluff faces. The trail consisted of miles of broken rock that had to be stepped around, stepped over, scrambled over, or climbed. So much for the trail getting easier in Virginia. Fortunately, the beautiful weather, the tremendous views, and getting to see ponies more than made up for the challenging trail conditions. My feet are very sore  tonight, but I escaped with no knee or ankle pain. Along this rocky adventure, I was able to see quite a few of the wild ponies. The first group I saw was a family unit with a young foal. I saw two additional herds, each numbering about a dozen members. One entered the camping area this evening and grazed quite near to my tent. There have been reports of the ponies attacking tents at night, perhaps looking for a handout because, despite the warning signs against it, many people feed the ponies.  As I lie here in my tent writing this, I hear a good deal of neighing in the neighborhood  (sorry, couldn't resist that one).  Hopefully, there will be no altercations.  My food bag is safely hung in a tree, so at least no pony will smell a handout from my tent. Yet another milestone I set today is my 500th mile on the trail. It's hard to believe I have already come this far. Today was one of the most challenging days I have had on the trail. I have several options tomorrow based on trail conditions and how I feel. If something exciting happens with the ponies, I'll make sure to let everyone know.","Lost Mountain Shelter

I slept pretty well and woke up at 6:00 feeling surprisingly unaffected by yesterday's hike. The ponies were around and about last night, but they left all of the tents alone. I packed up and was ready for the trail at 7:20. It takes me 80 minutes every morning from the time I decide to get up to the time I start on the trail.  I guess after over forty days of doing this, I have my routine established. The first part of today's hike was still in the Highlands, and I saw some more ponies and also some long horned cattle. The trail passed through The Scales, an old corral where farmers would bring their cattle to sell. After the land was logged, farmers came in to raise cattle, since the land wasn't suitable for crops. The farmers discovered that their cattle lost weight being driven down the mountain for sale, so a corral was built high up in the mountains.  Since the cattle were weighed here for sale, it was called The Scales. After the land was purchased as a park, wild ponies were introduced to keep the land from reverting back to forest. I'm not sure how the long horn cattle fit in. I'm just glad they weren't interested in me.  Several were right by the trail, and I had to walk right past them. After leaving the Highlands, the trail conditions took a marked turn for the better. In fact, except for the last few miles today, the trail was very conducive to hiking. While the trail was steep in several places, the rocks and stobs only appeared every now and then. The trail also reverted back to more of a green tunnel, with no long range views. There were a lot of rhododendron blooming, and I also saw a bush with beautiful orange flowers. I also saw two white tailed deer, the first I have seen. I crossed many streams, usually by way of stepping stones, but there were also several very nice walking bridges constructed over the larger ones. Comers Creek had a very impressive cascading waterfall with a footbridge right in front of it. I guess my ""trail legs"" are pretty well developed, as I ended up with my first official twenty mile day today. The weather was bright and sunny, although a bit warmer than yesterday.  I decided to push on to Trimpi Shelter and arrived there at 6:15, a full hour earlier than I got into camp yesterday. I saw Anvil at the shelter, and he told me that all four of the slackpackers from Boots Off made it the forty miles to Damascus before dark, despite hiking in heavy rain for three hours. That's quite an accomplishment, and one that I will never even try to replicate.  It is pretty warm tonight, and I left one of the vestibules open so I'll have a breeze. It looks like warmer weather is upon us. Tomorrow, I plan on getting to the Mount Rogers visitor center by early afternoon. Uncle Puck, a thru hiker I have gotten to know, wants to head back to Damascus for Trail Days, because he wants advice on footwear. I think I've decided to accompany him so I can attend Trail Days. We'll take the bus from the visitor center to Marion (it costs fifty cents a ride).  According to my guide book, you can also call and have a pizza delivered directly to the shelter located by the visitor center. We'll have to see if we have time, but pizza is always a good idea. Once in Marion, we can get a shuttle back to Damascus. I'll either stay back at the Hiker Inn or pitch my tent in Tent City. I've heard a lot about Trail Days and am excited about experiencing it first hand. There will be lots of vendors, speakers, musicians, and lots and lots of free food. There is a hiker parade Saturday morning, and I will get to march with the thru hiker class of 2017. Either Saturday night or Sunday, I'll catch a ride back to Marion and will continue my journey northward.","Wise Shelter

I slept well and never closed the vestibule or got completely in my sleeping bag. Warmer weather is definitely upon us. I was up a little after 5:00 and on the trail by 7:00. The trail was splendid for walking. There was over a mile that I kept double checking for white blazes, as it was straight, flat, and clear of obstructions.  Could this really be the AT?  I made excellent time all morning.  It was a green tunnel, but there were all kinds of birds singing and there was often the fragrance of wild flowers.  I saw a king snake sunning itself by the trail. I hiked awhile with Weather Girl and, before I knew it, I was at the Mount Rogers Visitor's Center. I arrived at 11:30, and the next shuttle bus to Marion did not leave until 2:30. With the help of Steve, the ranger on duty, we called in a food order.  I couldn't resist the Texas Burger (1/2 pound burger with cheese, onions and barbecue sauce) and fries for $5.99.  A good number of hikers ended up relaxing and waiting for the shuttle bus. We were entertained by Pipes, who demonstrated the origin of his trail name by playing a penny whistle and his bagpipes. The bus arrived to take us to Marion and dropped us off at the Wal-Mart.  Uncle Puck, Juan, and I split the cost of a taxi to Damascus.  Juan and I got bunks at ""The Place,"" a hostel run as a ministry of the local Methodist church. The care taker, Bayou, and Cahoda made us feel very much at home.  We went by another hostel to do our laundry and so that I could catch up on my trail journal. We then went to the local fire department for a free hiker feed. We feasted on fried chicken, baked beans, cole slaw, and dessert. They fed hundreds of people. Not much is going on with vendors, but that will change tomorrow. I did meet Nate, Sharon, and Asher, the Hiking Vikings. Nate and Sharon thru hiked a few years ago and made excellent you tube videos of their experiences. ""Tips from the Trail"" are very informative and fun videos. The Hiking Vikings were the first set of videos I watched as I began to seriously prepare for the trail, and it was very fun to get a chance to visit with them. I'm looking forward to the rest of Trail Days. I will stay in Damascus Friday and Saturday and will get a shuttle back to Marion on Sunday to start hiking again. I am showered, very full of food, and my clothes are laundered. And, oh yes, porcelain toilets that flush with limitless toilet paper.  What else could anyone ask for?","Trimpi Shelter

I had a fun, active day for the first day of Trail Days. Juan Gone and I went for breakfast at 7:15. After breakfast, he made a video of me congratulating the two graduates from my school in Rolla to play at their graduation today. We used Facebook to send it. Congratulations to Ordia, Erica, and their families! We then met Uncle Puck. Near the hostel, canopies were set up, and there were volunteers from a local church who were washing hikers's feet and giving foot massages.  Also there were local health workers who were taking blood pressures (I didn't write mine down, but it was low), and answering any questions.  Every hiker was given a free pair of socks. There were also foot doctors who examined hikers' feet and offered advice. The doctor I saw was pleased with tbe condition of my feet.  He recommended adding a small pad to my next pair of Superfeet inserts that might help alleviate the pressure off of the balls of my feet. It was very impressive the number of volunteers in this one area alone giving their time and expertise to aid hikers. After having my feet examined, I headed over to the vendors' area. I had my picture taken for this year's yearbook and joined ALDHA (Appalachian Long Distance Hiker Association).  I visited many of the vendors and then went for more free food (lunch provided by ALDHA).  Uncle Puck, Juan, and I then rented mountain bikes and a shuttle ride to near the top of Whitetop Mountain.  We then rode our bikes seventeen miles along the Virginia Creeper Trail back to Damascus. It was downhill nearly all the way and great fun. It started to storm about halfway down, but we got lucky because there is a little cafe located right along the trail at that point. As it started to pour, we stopped for ice cream at the cafe, and the rain had subsided by the time we were ready to ride again. We got back to Damascus after a ride of a little over two hours on the bikes. I went back to the vendor area and met Redbeard, who made a very good set of videos about his AT thru hike on you tube.  He now works for ZPacks, and we had a good conversation on thru hiking and lightweight gear.  I then texted Dapper and learned that most of the old group was at the Damascus Brewery.  A nice fellow named Joe offered to give me a ride there after trying to explain where it was. It was great to be back together with Dapper, Space Jam, Alex (now known by her trail name of Boundary), Billy, Monty, and Trail Mix. Reed, Nate, and Jose opted to remain on the trail and not return to Damascus. It was wonderful getting reacquainted again. After sampling some excellent local beer we headed to Food City, where I scored four Spam Singles for my upcoming resupply.  From there, I went with the group to Tent City, where they are all staying. Tent City really needs to be experienced to be believed. There are literally hundreds of tents set up in the fields and woods near the outskirts of Damascus. It's quite a deal. While visiting with my ""old friends,"" I met Bigfoot, another hiker who has documented his thru hike on you tube. His videos are thorough and well created, and he has also made numerous how-to videos on tips he developed while only having 100 dayd to hike the entire AT. It was exciting to get to meet him and his girlfriend, Miss Bigfoot.  He asked if he could film me for an upcoming video he is making, and I was happy to oblige. He asked me about lessons I've learned from the trail and what I use for motivation. I look forward to seeing how it turns out. After that, I chatted with the Damascus law enforcement officers in charge of overseeing Tent City and thanked them for their service. I then mosied back to the hostel to find that Juan had checked out to move into Tent City. I'm staying put, and I worked on my journal and began sorting out the food I already have so I can know what I will need for my next resupply. There will be another really busy day at Trail Days tomorrow, including the Hiker Parade and, you guessed it, more free food.  It's been a very busy time, and I am really glad I came back for it. I'll be back on the trail by Sunday.","Mount Rogers Visitor's Center/Marion/Damascus

I slept quite a bit better last night than the night before. I got up leisurely because I will be staying in the same place tonight. I wandered over to the Fire Station around 7:00 to take advantage of their excellent fund-raiser breakfast of eggs, sausage, and biscuits and gravy. I then went back to the hostel to get my pack to take it to the folks at ZPacks so they could look at the straps that are twisting.  As I passed the Fire Station on the way back to the park, the hobbit came out in me, and I stopped for second breakfast. When I got to their booth, Joe from ZPacks told me they have upgraded the straps on their later version of my pack.  He upgraded all the straps on my pack for free. Thanks, ZPacks!  I then saw Boundary and Juan Gone, and we decided to go get lunch. The Yellow Deli were serving delicious sandwiches at half price for thru hikers, so I had an absolutely yummy turkey and provelone sandwich that set me back all of $3.50.  We then headed over to Sundog Outfitters where the parade was scheduled to start. We were greeted with free hot dogs.  Also, Sundog is the first outfitter I've seen that sells individual mayonnaise packets. When heated, mayonnaise converts to a clear oil that makes it a great way to add fat to pouched meals without having to worry about carrying potentially messy oil. I picked up ten of them. Hikers gathered by the hundreds for the parade, many dressed in silly costumes. We more or less organized by year, with our year bringing up the rear. We had a big banner that we all signed. It was loud, rowdy, and fun. The townspeople got involved by spraying us with super soakers.  About halfway through the parade, Mother Nature decided to get involved, and the heavens opened up with a vigorous thunderstorm. We were all soon soaked to the skin. This did nothing to put a damper on the enthusiasm level. After all, we're hikers who are used to walking in the rain.  After the parade, I went back to the hostel, took a shower, and got dressed in my town clothes (I paraded in my hiking clothes). The rain stopped, and the sun came back out. I went back to the vendors' area.  I saw Bigfoot again, and he asked if he could interview me again about my motivation for hiking and about Beau. I had already cleared it with Beau's parents, so I told Bigfoot the story. I was really impressed with Bigfoot, and thanked him again for his influence on hiking philosophy via his you tube videos. He is a trully genuine, friendly guy. After my interview, I got a text from Dapper inviting me to dinner. I went to BoNo McFarlands and had a good feed with Dapper, Boundary, Space Jam, Billy, Trail Mix, and Bluebird.  I veered slightly from my usual fare and had meat loaf, macaroni and cheese, and cole slaw. I planned on calling it an early night and returned to the hostel to put my wet clothes in the sun to dry. I heard the music of Jackdaw 7 coming from the concert stage through my window and decided to go back to the park and enjoy the concert. On my way, I was excited to see Gizmo and Melanie. I met Gizmo and Melanie on Springer Mountain.  In fact, Gizmo may have been the first person I met on the trail. He lives in Johnson City and has had to leave the trail periodically to go home on business.  He thinks he will be home during the railroad convention, and we hope to be able to get together while I'm back in Johnson City for the convention. After chatting a bit, I headed over to the concert stage. The rain had cooled everything off, and the weather was perfect for an outdoor concert.  I enjoyed listening to Jackdaw 7 and left the concert after they finished a bit before nine to return to the hostel to get everything in order to catch our 10:30 shuttle back to Marion. I have had an absolutely wonderful time at Trail Days and am touched by the friendliness of the people of Damascus.  While it's been a great diversion, I'm looking forward to getting back to the woods to continue my way northbound. Rain is forecast for the next four days. Sigh.  Oh well, liquid sunshine . . .","Damascus, Virginia

I got the best sleep of my stay at the hostel last night and did not wake up until 6:15. There was an unfortunate incident that happened this morning that served to remind me that the real world does not go away just because you are on the trail. There was a couple staying in the same bunk room that I was in that became involved in a domestic dispute this morning. Apparently, they had met online and decided to hike the trail together. I'm unsure of the details, but the dispute involved the ownership of a pack. Things became rather heated but did not cross the line to violence. The situation seemed pretty well sorted out by the time the police arrived, and I believe the woman has decided to return home. I guess it's important to remember that we bring who we are to the trail and don't magically become another person because we decide to walk a long way.  It is ironic that such an incident would occur at the place where most people would consider the least likely at Trail Days to encounter such problems. Tent City is rightfully considered the wildest venue during Trail Days, but the problems of the world can crop up anywhere. Fortunately, there seems to be no harm done in this morning's altercation. After I packed up, I headed over to meet Uncle Puck for breakfast. A very nice woman named Vera accompanied us, and gave us a ride. Mojo's Restaurant is highly recommended by this hiker to anyone who visits Damascus. After breakfast, we met up with Juan Gone and caught our shuttle back to Marion.  We resupplied at Wal-Mart and were typical hiker trash as we sorted through our food, repacking it and discarding the wrappers and containers. We were polite, and everyone who had to walk around us seemed very understanding. I'm sure it's nothing new to them. We then headed to Subway for lunch, and I also bought two McDonald's cheeseburgers to tote with me for supper tonight. Bea from the taxi company showed up immediately after we called her to take us back to the Mount Rogers Visitor's Center, where we got back on the trail. Bea was the only taxi driver to shuttle us this weekend, and the cost was less than a shuttle service would have been. She is a great conversationalist and filled us in on some interesting local history. We were back on the trail by 1:00. It's easy to see how towns can draw you in, since it took awhile to feel natural hiking again. As it was, I only did 6.8 miles today, but at least I am back on the trail. The rain began a bit before 2:00, and as I write this in my tent at 7:00, shows no sign of abating. In fact, it is steadily worsening.  There was a wet kind of beauty in the woods today. The rhododendron are heavy in bloom and add beautiful color. The rain did slacken enough for me to take a photo of a view of Walker Mountain, which I should summit tomorrow. We also encountered a new definition of ""green tunnel"" today, as the undergrowth now often grows right up to the trail so you are brushing against it on both sides. Add a steady rain, and you now have a new way of getting even wetter. After talking with the people from the American Chestnut Foundation, I have started looking for the trees.  I saw numerous ones, but the largest was about one inch in diameter. Sadly, once they get any bigger, the blight kills the sprout. They are easily identified by the sharp points on their leaves.  The Chinese Chestnut, which is immune to the blight, has rounded points.  It will be so wonderful if they are successful at creating a hybrid, so the American Chestnut (with a little help from its Chinese cousin) can thrive again.  I made it in good time to the Chatfield Shelter and decided to call it a day even though I got here just a bit past 4:30. Uncle Puck and Juan Gone made the same choice, as did Gravity and Downhill. Uncle Puck and Juan Gone opted to stay in the shelter, while Gravity, Downhill, and I pitched tents. Later, Lost and River arrived and added to the crowd in the shelter. I pitched my tent, ate my cheeseburgers and some other food (if I eat it, I don't have to carry it!), and finished my other camp chores. Although it was only 6:30 by the time I was done, I decided to go to bed. There is something very relaxing about being all warm and dry in your tent while the rain falls on the roof. It is supposed to continue to rain for the next several days.  I'm not sure how far I will hike tomorrow. How I feel and the weather conditions will largely determine that.  I have plenty of food and supplies to get me to my next resupply point in Bland, Virginia, so I don't have to feel in any big hurry to get there. Time will tell.","Mount Rogers Visitor's Center/Marion/Damascus

The rain ceased sometime during the night, and I woke up at 6:15. I took my time getting ready, trying to keep everything as dry as possible. I was on the trail at 8:00. I knew the next shelter area was 19.3 miles away with three mountains to climb up and over, but I didn't know about the trail conditions.  It looked like the weather was going to smile on us, however, so I decided I'd just start walking and see how things played out. I again saw a good number of American Chestnut trees and stopped to photograph one.  A few miles into the hike, I came to the Lindamood School. Built in 1894, the one room schoolhouse is completely furnished, left unlocked, and is perpetually supplied with goodies for hikers. I helped myself to a peach soda and an orange and also took some toilet paper, since some of mine was a victim of the rain yesterday. The schoolhouse is a beautiful building. There is a sign on the stove asking people to refrain from actually building a fire in it.  There is a list of infractions and their punishments posted on the wall.  A boy caught playing with a girl would earn himself four lashes. Uncle Puck and Juan Gone joined me there, and I stayed for about thirty minutes.  I left a note of thanks in the comments book and some money in the donation box.  From there, it was just a few miles to Atkins, Virginia.   We spend so much time walking in the woods on the AT that it is easy to forget how close to modern civilization we are. Reminders include the high power lines I crossed under today that could be heard buzzing for several minutes before I came to them and were loudly crackling with power when I walked directly under them. We crossed railroad tracks.on the outskirts of Atkins. Walking over a small rise, the Sunoco Station at Atkins and the Highway 81 interchange immediately came into view. Juan Gone had stopped at the gas station for cough drops, and we walked together along the service road, under Highway 81, and then back into the woods. About a mile later, I took the 0.1 mile side trail to visit the Davis cemetery, which dates from the late 1700s. About another mile and I came to a nice campsite complete with picnic table, a few tenting spots, and a privy. Juan Gone and Lost were already there eating lunch, so I joined them, even though it was early for me to eat.  The trail had been good so far, and we all decided to make miles while the sun shines and head for the next shelter. Uncle Puck joined us.  The blister on his heel was really bothering him, and he said he was planning on heading to the hostel several miles closer than the shelter. The trail the rest of the day had its share of steep up and downs but few rocky, difficult areas. There were quite a few muddy spots, but I only slipped a few times and never came close to falling. The area we are hiking through is more pastoral than before, and I walked through several cattle fields today.  The trail crosses fences using stiles, wooden ladders that go up and over the barbed wire. They make me a bit nervous, and I toss my trekking poles over the fence to have both hands free as I climb the one side, pivot direction on top (the nervous-making part), and then climb down the other side. I believe I crossed over ten of them today.  Along the way today, we crossed the one quarter mark. Lost and River were there as well and took a photo of me by the sign. It's hard to believe I am already twenty-five percent done with the trail. I was admittedly a bit weary as I climbed Brushy Mountain, my third mountain for the day, but I motored on and got to the shelter area by 7:00.  Juan Gone, River, Lost, and a friendly section hiker named Needham were already there. I set up my tent, cooked dinner, got water, and was in my tent getting ready for bed by a bit before nine. During dinner, I chatted with River and learned that she is a certified teacher who has been working as a substitute. She told me she really liked working with the special need a students in the resource room and that she was considering getting certified in special ed.  She also has worked a great deal.with horses and has helped with an equine therapy program for children with special needs. I wish her the best is whatever field she finds herself.  I feel confidant she has a bright future.  I settled into bed a bit after nine, dozed until 12:00, and am now completing my journal entry. With no service here, it will be posted as soon as possible. The forecast is for rain and thunderstorms the next few days, but we'll have to wait and see. Despite the earlier forecast, today ended up being a great day for hiking, and maybe we'll get lucky again tomorrow.","Chatfield Shelter

Today was quite a day. There was a storm last night which had ended by the time I got up at 6:00.  I slept well and felt really good this morning. I was on the trail by 7:30. The rain began again less than ten minutes after I started hiking. It was great that it held off long enough for me to get packed up.  I started by hiking up and over Lynn Camp Mountain, which is small and presented little difficulty. At the end of the descent, the trail crosses Lick Creek on a very nice foot bridge. Next up was Chestnut Knob, which is the first major mountain we've climbed in awhile. The elevation increased a little over 2,000 feet over four miles. The trail was good, and the rain let up at about 9:00, so it was a nice climb. A good part of the mountain is pasture, and there would have been nice views except for the fog.  Chestnut Knob Shelter is located at the top of the mountain. It is a unique shelter built of stone and fully enclosed. Go Chill and her trail dog, Sir Barks-a-Lot, were making lunch outside the shelter when I got there. I had met them previous to Trail Days and passed them by.  They skipped Trail Days, so I got to see them again.  She told me she had been able to download some podcasts, so I checked my phone. I had service and was able to add the past two entries to my journal. I added one photo for each day, but stopped there because I still had miles I wanted to hike. I thought I might have service tonight (I didn't).  I ate lunch inside the shelter with Lost, River, and Fireproof. Other hikers arrived while we were eating, including Gravity, who I have camped with a few times.  The rain resumed while I was eating.  It started back up around one o'clock as is still at it as I write this at 10:15 pm.  After leaving the shelter, I had a nice walk in the rain to Walker Gap, and then things got truly interesting. For the next five miles, a glance at the Guidebook would lead you to believe it would be easy, since there is no real elevation change. Don't ever forget to check out the little squiggly lines on the topo map.  If I wanted to give someone a taste of the first quarter of the AT, I would take them on this five mile hike, especially in a cold, unrelenting rain like today. It was like AT 101, a smorgasbord of all the trail conditions we have encountered. There were extremely steep ascents and descents, many of them muddy and slippery.  There were also more moderate ascents and descents, although very little flat trail. There was trail full of rocks, rock scrambling over jumbles of various size boulders, crossing large, rain-slickened rocks tilted at 45 degree angles, and clamboring across the sides of bluffs.  For good measure, there were numerous logs of various sizes across the trail. None of these examples lasted very long, although they certainly repeated themselves often enough. It felt like an obstacle course, or maybe the Reader's Digest Condensed AT.  I was fascinated by all the samples, although, I will admit, I was quite happy to see the end of it when the trail reached VA 623, a gravel road. Unfortunately, I have no photos of the obstacle course, since my phone was triple protected from the elements in the belt pouch of my pack. The last four and a half miles into camp were more typical, and I arrived at 6:45, having hiked 20.1 miles.  Many shelters have an overhang or a porch which allow hikers to complete chores out of the rain, but not Jenkins Shelter. Not surprisingly, the sleeping area was packed full, and the picnic table sits out in the rain. I had no plan on sleeping in the shelter, but it is nice to have a dry spot to regroup. I was able to get my tent up and my equipment inside with very little water getting into the tent, despite setting it up in a steady downpour.   My pack and hiking pants are in the vestibule  (my pants legs are pretty much a muddy mess) while the other clothes I wore today are in my extra plastic trash bag. I opted to not cook tonight but had plenty of other things to eat. My plan is to hike 11 miles tomorrow to US Highway 52 and get a shuttle into Bland for resupply and to get my clothes washed.  I'll leave Bland the next day headed for Pearisburg.  For now, I am content and toasty in my sleeping bag as the rain continues outside. I know the saying: ""No rain, no pain, no Maine,"" but the rain has my permission to cease by morning. We'll just have to wait and see.","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

The rain ended during the night, and I was up at 6:00 and on the trail by 7:40.  It was cool and misty, and I made good time. Although I am pleased with how well I held up after the big miles the last two days, I decided to not push it today. As I started hiking, my plan was to get to Bland and stay at the Zero Days Inn Hostel.  As I walked, I decided I wasn't ready to be in a town yet, and I had enough supplies to make it the extra miles to Pearisburg.  I enjoyed crossing Laurel Creek on a really nice footbridge. While called a creek, it seems more like a river to me.  I hiked through an area of American Chestnuts, none any taller than I am. I stopped to photograph one that represents their plight. There are several sprigs of new growth growing up from a slightly larger tree that had already succumbed to the blight. I was in no hurry, since I didn't plan on going that far anyway. Plans changed again when I got to US 52 on the outskirts of Bland. There is a brand new outfitters right along the trail, which opened two days earlier. They were selling BBQ sandwiches and hot dogs for cheap, and I certainly took advantage. A thru hiker named Patch has a radar weather app, which showed a major thunderstorm with possible tornado-force winds was heading our way. The TV in the outfitters was showing Bonanza (how cool is that?), and there were severe storm warnings scrolling across the screen. I decided to return to my original plan and took the shuttle to the Zero Days Inn Hostel.  I had a good time at the hostel and, frankly,  enjoyed staying inside during the storm. I spent time with Extra Mile and Leapfrog, who I haven't seen in several weeks. I am continually amazed at the quality of people I meet on the trail. We had a great conversation that ranged from everything from what makes a good dad, power lifting, body building, and dealing with stress on the trail. Leapfrog helped get the laundry situation organized, which was no small feat with the amount of dirty, muddy laundry hikers brought in. There was a common area and a kitchen area where we took turns congregating. As soon as my laundry got done (after 10:30) I went to bed. I'm planning on catching the 7:00 shuttle back to the trail, as I hope to make it to Trent's Grocery tomorrow, which will be an 18.4 mile day. The weather is supposed to be nice tomorrow morning with rain developing in the afternoon. I'll be glad to be back on the trail tommorow.","Jenkins Shelter

Today was a very special day for no specific reason.  It's just a day that leaves me feeling blessed and joyful as I write this tonight in the quiet solitude of my tent. I slept well at the hostel and was up by 6:00.  Inasias and I were the only ones requesting the 7:00 shuttle back to the trail, and Jeremy was happy to oblige. I had a great experience at Zero Days Inn Hostel, and Jeremy really went out of his way to make sure things went smoothly. A comfortable mattress and sheets also helped.  I also scored a lower bunk!  I had met Inasias before Trail Days, and it was fun to meet up with her again. Her trail name is an acronym for:  It's Not A Stick It's A Staff.  Her name is in honor of the hiking staff she carries. Inasias is quite talented and sang and played the guitar last night in the hostel's common area. She also writes poetry.  She hikes faster than I do, and I enjoyed watching her disappear into the distance as I hiked through Bland.  She would be the only other person I would see for hours. Hiking across I-77 was interesting. There was a tremendous view as the rain had ended and the sun was shining. The trail was a very narrow sliver of dirt squeezed between a fence (thoughtfully provided so you wouldn't fall off the bridge) and the guard rail.  After following the road a piece, the AT returned to the woods. The hike this morning was truly a walk in the woods.  The trail was, for the most part, good, although muddy in places from the recent rains. The sun was shining. I heard many birds twittering and some wild turkeys gobbling. I saw several squirrels. I stepped over a large pile of bear scat (but didn't see the bear).  I took the opportunity to call Becky and Sandy, and I also called both of my schools back home. It was good to get to chat a few minutes.  I met Gravity near the base of Brushy Mountain.  He had stopped at a stream for water, and I joined him to do the same. We hiked together for a bit. On the way up Brushy Mountain, we passed the 600 mile mark. I ate lunch at the top of Brushy Mountain at a pretty spot complete with a comfortable log to sit on.  Shortly after lunch, the rain resumed.  It also turned colder, but the rain, while steady, never stormed.  Close to the end of the day's hike, the trail crosses Kimberling Creek over this amazing suspension bridge.  Despite the rain, I got my phone out to photograph the bridge. Gravity took my picture on the bridge.  Upon reaching VA 606, Gravity and I walked the half mile to Trent's Grocery. As we walked down the road, I asked Gravity how he came by his trail name.  Among other things, he told me it stood for Specific Gravity, which, he told me, was a term used in brewing beer.  Gravity is an avid homebrewer, who has been brewing since the 1980s!  We had an animated discussion about homebrewing in general and our individual methods in specific.  We now have mutual standing invitations to each other's homes.  It was raining pretty hard when we got to Trent's Grocery. Samantha, the very sweet woman behind the counter, took our food orders, and then we picked up a few resupply needs.  I had a cheeseburger with everything, potato wedges, and cheese sticks.  I drank a Gatorade, a V-8 Juice, a chocolate milk, and chased it all down with a hot chocolate.  While we were eating, we had a wonderful conversation with two local teachers and their families. We discussed thru hiking, the floods back home, and the challenges of education today. One of the women is a retired math teacher and the other teaches chemistry.  It was a tremendous time. Gravity and I excused ourselves so we could get our tents up and everything squared away before dark. The cost for tenting, which includes a bath house with flush toilets, hot water showers, and washer and dryer:  $6.00. The tent area is flat and grassy, with horses in an adjacent field.       Kimberling Creek is roaring nearby, but stiil well within its banks (we hope!). While setting up, we struck up a conversation with Subway, a thru hiker from New York. He is a retired police officer who spent a good part of his career working with schools. He also helped implement an equine program for at-risk youth and for children with special needs.  Needless to say, we had a lot of common ground to discuss.  Everyone then headed for their tents. I plan on reaching Pearisburg by the day after tomorrow,  so I'm looking at a 17 or so mile day tomorrow.  I've been in touch with several friends and family members from back home today, plus I've met so many wonderful new people. I guess it's time to go to sleep and wait to see what tommorow will bring.","US 52, Bland, Virginia (Zero Days Inn Hostel)

I fell asleep listening to the rush of the swollen Kimberling Creek and woke up at 6:00 feeling well rested. The sun came up, and it promised to be a beautiful and rain-free day. Today is a bit of a landmark, as it is my 50th day on the trail. Gravity and I headed up to Trent's at 7:30 for breakfast. I had a ham, egg, and cheese biscuit and a tenderloin, egg, and cheese biscuit.  Both were delicious.  We were back on the trail at 8:30.  The trail was very muddy in many places. There are few water run-offs built into the trail in this area, so water runs down the trail for a long way and collects as marshes at low spots. In spite of the fact that our dry socks didn't last ten minutes, the hike to Dismal Falls went quickly. There is a 0.3 mile blue-blazed trail to the Falls.  I have no idea why it is called Dismal Falls, because it is an impressive sight.  The trail ends up at the top of the Falls, and it is possible to walk right out to the water. There is a campsite located part way down the Falls, but the only access I could locate required a drop of over five feet down a sheer rock cliff. Since I don't carry a magic elfin rope like Frodo and Sam, I contented myself to remaining at the top of the Falls.  From there, the hike to Wapiti Shelter was relatively flat and easy, with a good amount of trudging through more mud required.  I ate lunch with Gravity at the shelter, which boasts of an actual outhouse and not a semi-open privy.  There was then a very steep climb up to a ridgeline, most of which was walking up through what could pass as a creek bed with several inches of water running down it.  Since there was a rock bottom to the trail/creek, the water was clear, and I purposefully walked in it to help wash the mud out of my shoes, socks, and feet. Not that I had much choice, as there wasn't any way to really avoid the water.  Along the way, I came across the marker for 1,000 kilometers, for our metric friends.  Since this is my 50th day on the trail, it looks like I am averaging 20 kilometers per day. On the wildlife side of things, I saw a five foot black snake (who didn't want his picture taken) and another wild turkey. I will be staying in Pearisburg tomorrow night, and Gravity's wife will be meeting him there. I'm looking forward to meeting her, and they are going to take me to the outfitter shop, since my trekking poles need repair.  Because of this, we tented at Docs Knob Shelter, which is only 8.3 miles to VA 634, with Pearisburg a 0.7 mile walk down the road.  I really wanted to visit Woods Hole Shelter, however.  I read about it in the Appalachian Trail Conservancy magazine.  The hostel is in an 1880's Chestnut log cabin, and was originally run by Roy and Tillie Wood.  Their granddaughter, Neville and her husband, Michael, run it today.  The hostel is a working farm, with an emphasis on sustainable living through farming, organic gardening, and beekeeping.  Guests are often invited to share in communal, all-organic meals. Both Neville and Michael are massage therapists.  Neville was leading a yoga class when I completed the 0.5 mile walk down Sugar Run Road to the hostel. It is a beautiful facility, and I got a chance to talk with Neville after her class, and I hope to come back and visit someday.  I also saw Inasias there, and she wrote down her poem for me:
Inasias
That's a long stick you sayAs I come into campAs if I hadn't noticedWhat I carry in my hand.So when you introduce yourself And ask how do you do,""It's not a stick, it's a staff,"" I'll say,""It's nice to meet you, too.""That's a long name you say,But the acronym's less fuss.I-N-A-S-I-A-SMy name's Inasias.
I enjoyed my added trip to the hostel and figured I would still get to Docs Knob Shelter plenty early, because it was only an additional 2.3 miles up the trail. I didn't figure on the rocks. The AT was at it again with long stretches that required scrambling over rocks and boulders of all sizes.  I have never encountered so many large rocks that still manage to tilt and shift when stepped on.  The going is very slow, and it can get very frustrating.  Gravity reminded me of a good piece of advice while we were discussing the rocks: ""Remember to embrace the suck.""  It's all part of the package.  I met Gravity along the way, and we made it to the shelter a bit before 8:00. We were able to find two suitable tent spots squirreled away amongst rhododendron bushes.  Getting water required climbing over some huge boulders and dipping the water from a natural stone basi I've never seen anything quite like it, and it was pretty cool.  We shared dinner time with Crayola, Scout, and Trail Ninja (who has decided to change her trail name).  Gravity had carried along an aluminum bottle of Budweiser that he received from a trail angel, and he was kind enough to share. It was dark by the time we hung our food bags.  I was ready for bed by 10:00.  I slept for two hours before waking up to write my journal. I plan on staying at the Angel's Rest Hiker Haven tomorrow in Pearisburg.  It is run by a friend of Dave's from the Roan Mountain hostel.  Gravity will be spending a few days with his wife, and I will get back on the trail Sunday morning with five days of resupply.  Now, it's time to go back to sleep and perhaps dream of relatively rock-free trail.","VA 606/Trent's Grocery

I slept very well in my little hidey hole under the rhododendron bushes, got up at my usual time, and left with Gravity at 7:45, bound for Pearisburg and resupply. Perhaps I was distracted by the butterfly poster in the privy, perhaps it was the darkness of my tent site, or perhaps it was just my inherent forgetfulness, but I apparently made my first major mistake of the journey. Those who know me well are probably quite surprised that it took this long. I must have left my bag of tent stakes at the campsite. More about this misadventure to follow shortly. We made good progress on the trail today. There were places that were rocky and a few that were treacherously slick, but we made good time. There were a few occasions with excellent views, particularly Angel's Rest. I climbed up on the large rock to get a better view of the town of Pearisburg and of a large factory that Gravity informs me produces filters for cigarettes. We then hiked steeply down into Pearisburg.  Most hikers reach Pearisburg via Cross Avenue, which the AT reaches at mile 634.3. We hiked the additional mileage to 635.4 and met Gravity's wife, Kim, at the Narrows Road Parking Area. Gravity told me it is one of the newer pieces of trail, and that the AT previously followed the road. Along this section, which will be remembered for, among other things, very slick rocks, we met a black snake that, unlike his cousin yesterday, did not mind being photographed at all.  We also saw two white tail deer.  I also saw Diogenes, whom I hadn""t seen since Hot Springs. Along the way, I received a text from Juan Gone, informing me that he had secured a room at the Plaza Motel and would I like to stay there with him? I sent back a yes vote. We met Kim at the parking lot, and she provided us with water and fresh fruit. She is obviously a wonderful person, and she re-extended Gravity""s invitation to visit them in Oak Ridge someday. She and Gravity drove me to the hotel and then left to spend Memorial Day weekend together. I got to the room, showered, and then took my clothes to the sweet lady at the front desk who washed our laundry for us.  I then headed across the road to the Lucky Star Chinese Restaurant, where I had the AYCE (all you can eat) buffet for $6.89.  I don't know how they stay in business, because I alone ate five plates of food (one was salad, though).  I then resupplied for the next five days at the Food Lion and headed back to the hotel. It was as I was taking inventory that I realized my tent stakes were missing. It was 4:50 pm.  There is a hardware store across the road from the hotel that advertised on a tree beside the trail that they were also an outfitter. I scurried over there by 4:55 only to learn that they closed at 4:00 and wouldn't reopen until Monday morning.  Undetered, I headed for Goodwill.  Somehow, I just wasn't worried. I found this wire gizmo for $1.99. Perhaps its original use was to hold clothes; I honestly don't know. I've included a photo of it and would appreciate it if someone would let me know what it was. Regardless of its past history, my newest possession soon became eight new tent stakes.  I was able to bend the heavy wire and then score it with the file on my mini-Leatherman until I could break it to length. I'm very lucky, since had it been like most days, I would have gotten into camp after a hard day's hike, only to discover I was stakeless.  Who knows, I may carry my new stakes all the way to Maine.  Flush with victory over my latest bout of forgetfulness, I headed back across the street, this time to the excellent Mexican Restaurant.  I was accompanied by Juan Gone and also by Leapfrog and Extra Mile, who were in the room below us. The dinner was top notch.  We returned to the hotel and chatted in the parking lot a bit before returning to our rooms. I packed up for tomorrow and went to bed.  I plan on getting an early start tomorrow. Juan Gone and I will hit the local Hardee's on the way out of town. My next goal is to be in Catawba, Virginia by Thursday, where I will meet my friend, Patricia, who has so graciously offered to drive me to Johnson City, Tennessee, so I can attend the annual East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad Historical Society convention.  More on that in the coming days.  For now, it's back to bed, as I still have 72.9 miles of walking to get to Catawba.","Docs Knob Shelter

I slept well and was up by 6:30.  Since everything was pretty much packed the evening before, I was ready to go by 7:15.  Juan Gone and I left the hotel and hiked over to Hardee's, where we ate breakfast. Afterwards, we split ways.  Juan Gone had gotten off the trail at Cross Avenue, while Gravity and I had hiked an additional 1.1 miles of the AT, and had gotten off at the Narrows Road Parking Lot. I had an easy stroll down Main Street to Narrows Road.  We left Hardee's at 8:00, and I was back on the AT by 8:20.  I briefly hiked through the woods, and then exited the trees to hike along US 460 on the Senator Shumate Bridge.  I exited the bridge by circling under it and walked adjacent to the Celanese Factory before reentering the woods. I enjoy the few urban snippets of the AT, since they add an interesting contrast to the usual experience. The original concept for the AT was that small communities would develop along the walkway. That never happened, but the AT does occasionally pass through everyday life.  There were two significant climbs early in the day, but both had good trail.  I passed by numerous Red Pink flowers.  The flowers are bright red with a v-shaped notch in each petal, so the Pink in their name has the same origin as Pinking Shears and not the color.  I also walked out of the woods onto a grassy area that was alive with flowering plants. The trail has pretty much dried out, and what was sticky mud two days ago was spongy trail today.  The morning was cool and sunny, with rain in the forecast beginning at 4:00.  It clouded up around 3:00 while I was eating my lunch sitting on a comfortable log.  It started sprinkling as I finished my Spam and Cheese burrito. I put the rain cover on my pack, but the rain never amounted to anything. It was partly cloudy the rest of the day. It was pretty much a perfect day to hike.  There was a long stretch without water this afternoon, so I made sure I had all water bottles filled at the last water source for over ten miles.  The afternoon hike was pretty typical of the trail lately; mostly easy trail with lots of ups and downs, with a healthy sprinkling of rocky areas thrown in for good measure. I concentrated on ""Embracing the suck"" at the rocky areas, took my time, and greatly lowered my frustration level. I made good time and planned on doing some pretty big miles today.  There were notices stapled to trees that the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter and surrounding area were closed to camping due to the large number of standing trees that had been killed by the gypsy moth infestation.  A mile beyond the shelter was ""The Captain's Place."" Famous for years among hikers, the Captain allowed people to camp in his yard.  His place was reached via a zipline over Stoney Creek, which is a substantial body of water. Unfortunately, the Captain has taken ill, and the zipline has been rendered unusable.  I hiked a few tenths of a mile further, looking for a stealth site.  I noticed a nice one next to a ten foot waterfall.  Then I saw that Juan Gone had aleady set up camp there.  I joined him and set up my tent. My new tent stakes worked like a charm. When looking at the creek to see where to get water, I discovered a substantial rock wall still standing along the waterway. I wonder if perhaps a mill used to stand there. I started the day passing modern-day industry and ended it by camping next to the remains of yesterday's industry.  It was late when I got to camp, having hiked 20.6 miles of the AT today, in addition to the early hiking to get back on the trail. I ended up completing my chores using my headlamp and was settled into bed by 9:30.  As I was getting undressed for bed, I was reminded of one of life's little pleasures: dry socks.  For the first time in many days, I took dry socks off of my feet  at the end of the day.  Oh, happy day! That would be it for today except for the Mystery of the Reappearing Tent Stakes.  Yesterday, I emptied my pack and checked it numerous times in my search for my  missing tent stakes. I had Juan check.  I looked again this morning. Nothing.  This evening while unpacking my pack in the deep twilight, my original tent stakes showed up.  I have no idea where they had been hiding. I'm guessing they were somehow caught in a fold in the bottom of my pack, except that there aren't any folds in the bottom of my pack. I've decided I am going to use my new tent stakes this week and then send them home with my friend Sharon, who is bringing my next pair of shoes to the railroad convention next weekend. I'll pack my original stakes where I can be sure to find them. I'm going back to sleep now. I plan on a shorter day of only 17 miles tomorrow.","Narrows Road Parking Lot/Pearisburg, Virginia

Happy Memorial Day!  Tonight, I went back and reread my final sentence from my journal yesterday: ""I plan on a shorter day of only 17 miles tomorrow.""  Shorter in miles, perhaps, but I was reminded today that there are other factors involved in what constitutes a day on the trail. Even after my long day yesterday, I woke up at 6:00 and felt fine.  I was on the trail by 7:45.  I knew from the Guidebook that I would have two substantial and steep climbs today, but that isn't anything particularly unusual.  I normally prefer my morning hike when I am fresh, but that did not prove the case today.  The first climb was extremely steep and unrelenting.  The AT is a very well marked trail. Sometimes it seems almost silly. The trail follows an obvious switchback, and there will be a double warning blaze on a tree right before the turn.  But sometimes, an additional marking would be helpful. This morning, as I worked my way up the very steep grade, the AT made a sharp turn to go up some log stairs, but the trail also appeared to go under some rhododendron bushes (which it tends to do quite often).  There was no warning blaze, and I lost the trail for awhile until I backtracked and found the stairs. No big deal, but it set the tone for the next challenge. Rocks.  For nearly four miles after reaching the top of the hill, the trail was nearly completely rocks. I tried remembering to ""Embrace the suck,"" but I have to admit that the rocks began to get to me.  I met a pair of very nice day hikers and their dog, Bear, who, in addition to giving me a tangerine, told me the trail would get better after the road.  I started looking for that road and was getting a little grumpy waiting for it to show up.  When it finally did, I noticed Diogenes, Turquoise, and a hiker named Bones sitting by a white pickup truck in the adjacent parking lot. Trail Magic!  A section hiker named Flame spent his Memorial Day afternoon by grilling hamburgers and giving them out to hungry hikers.  I enjoyed the food and company, and it got me to thinking again about those rocks. There will be many miles of them coming up, and I will have to realize that I will just need to slow down and get through them.  I admire the hikers who go by me and seem to navigate them so much better than I can, but I will simply get injured if I try to hurry through. That being said, there were many more miles of rocky trail today, including much of my afternoon hike.  I had thought I could get to my planned destination by 6:00, but it was after 7:30 when I arrived at the Laurel Creek Shelter tent area.  Despite the afternoon's hike being more difficult, my attitude and approach were better.  A friend has asked me what songs go through my head during the day.  I added a new one: ""We will Rock You,"" by Queen.  I was also reminded of a book by Richard Adams, one of my favorite authors.  ""Traveler"" is the story of the American Civil War as told by Robert E. Lee's horse, Traveler.  Adam's did a great deal of research on equine psychology to prepare for the book.  Perhaps the most moving part is when Traveler, who relates his experiences to the cat who shares his barn after the conflict had ended, tries to explain the concept of war.  He confides to the cat that the men were all excited about getting to go to this thing called ""war,"" and it must have been a wonderful place because the men were so excited about getting to go.  Unfortunately, they never made it there, because these men in blue coats kept getting in the way and fighting them so they never made it to ""war."" What brought this to mind today was Traveler trying to explain heaven to Tom.  The best he could do was imagine a place with fewer flies.  He was incapable of imagining a place with no flies.  Perhaps this is how I need to view the best of the AT, as a place with fewer rocks. I know there will be days of hiking on and through them in the time to come, and I need to accept this and just hike through them.This approach helped this afternoon, as did my mental impersonation of Freddy Mercury (I would never subject Mother Nature and my fellow hikers to an out-loud rendition of me attempting to sing, ""We will Rock You.""  I also tried focusing on the beauty of my surroundings, the sounds of the birds, and the wonderful weather conditions we enjoyed today. I really appreciate Flame and his Trail Magic and the two nice day hikers and their tangerine to help me work my thoughts around this way.  Katahdyn isn't going anywhere, and I'll just need to take the time and care it will require to get there and do everything I can to reduce my risk of injury. To return to my daily activities, I got to camp tired but in good spirits.  I perked up physically as soon as I got going on my camp chores. Juan Gone was glad to see me.  He had arrived at 4:00.  He was too early for Flame's Trail Magic at Mountain Lake Road, so sometimes there are benefits to being slow!  I finished up a few things by headlamp and was in bed before 10:00.  My feet, ankles, knees, and, most importantly, my attitude all seem fine.  I know this post is more philosophical than most I write, but it was just that kind of day.  I'm not sure how far I'll get tomorrow, but I am in fine shape to make it to Catawba by Thursday and, hopefully, to Katahdyn by this Fall.  Again, I hope everyone had a wonderful and blessed Memorial Day.","Unnamed Campsite at Mile 656.0

I had another good night's rest, was up at 6:00, and hit the trail by 7:40.  My rock pep talk turned out not to be needed at the beginning of my hike. The trail turned pastoral as I walked through several fields.  The weather was again perfect for hiking, sunny and cool.  The scenes from the fields were beautiful and serene. I saw my first daisies, which are my daughter Becky's favorite flower. I then passed the Keffer Oak, the largest oak tree on the AT in the south (there is one slightly larger in New York).  The Keffer Oak is very impressive.  It is over 18 feet around and is over 300 years old.  I then passed an old barn in the woods and several cows. The trail then turned very steep, with an elevation change of over 200 feet in 0.4 miles.  This was perhaps the steepest and longest sustained climb so far, but still very few rocks.  The first rocks I encountered today were in dozens of large piles.  One hiker tried to tell me that farmers back in the day stacked the rocks to make the rest of the area suitable for farming and grazing.  I'm having none.of that.  I told people I believe they are the AT's maintenance project for next year when they will be spread along the trail.  At least one hiker acted like he really believed me.  The trail rocks appeared as I hiked along the ridgeline of Sinking Creek Mountain.  There was a difference today, however. (Cue the hokey metaphor music).  Today, the rocks were the punctuation marks of the sentences of the trail.  Yesterday, they were the letters of the sentences.  Today, many of the rocks were like the commas in sentences; their purpose was to slow down the action.  Unlike yesterday, there was usually still earthen trail, just with rocks.  For about two miles of the ridge, the rocks were the explanation points, adding some real excitement.  Hiking across huge, tilted rock faces with beautiful views, where a slip could cause you to tumble down a very steep ravine, is pretty exciting.  At one point, losing your balance to the left would have resulted in falling off a cliff.  Somehow, the potential of serious injury by long fall from slipping off a tilted rock face is more exhilerating than potential of a broken ankle by tilted, wobbly rock on a flatter surface with no view.  While my pace was slow, I really enjoyed the ridge walk today.  I shared the view with numerous lizards, a few of whom agreed to pose for photos.  There was one rock who tried to be the period of the sentence and put an end to things  (I warned you the metaphor was hokey).  This rock was actually in an area with very few others.  The trail was covered with leaves and pine needles.  This rock was about two feet long, three inches high, and covered with leaves.  It caused me to do my very first complete face plant.  Fortunately, I was able to get my hands in front of my face before the ground arrived.  The way I learned to use my trekking pole straps also really works, as the poles rolled away from my thumbs and fingers. I landed in soft dirt and leaves and was completely uninjured, although my pack did come up over my head.  An exciting moment, thankfully, with no bad after effects. None the worse for wear, when I reached the north end of the ridge crest of Sinking Creek Mountain, I crossed the Eastern Continental Divide. The Atlantic Ocean is 430 miles in one direction, while the Gulf of Mexico is 1,920 miles in the other.  From there, I had an uneventful walk down Sinking Creek Mountain and then a steep, long climb up Brush Mountain.  A little less than a mile past the crest of Brush Mountain,  a monument to Audie Murphy has been erected.  The most decorated American soldier in World War Two, he was killed in a plane crash near this site in 1971.  Near this site along the trail I found Juan Gone, who had been joined by a very nice southbound section hiker named Just Susan.  We had a good conversation about hiking in general and about what each of us would encounter tomorrow. Just Susan, from Chicago, has recovered from a broken hip to continue her section hike of the AT.  About thirty minutes before sundown, Juan Gone and I headed for the observation point just past Audie Murphy's Memorial to watch the sunset. It was peaceful and serene, and the sun put on quite a show.  We walked back to camp, and I finished my few remaining chores by headlamp.  The closest water source is several miles in each direction from where we camped, so I toted an extra liter up Brush Mountain.  I'll have enough to get to the next water source at Trout Creek, 3.8 miles north. This is the first section of the AT where I have really had to plan out my water stops.  I have 11.7 miles to go tomorrow to get to Four Pines Hostel.  Part of those miles is through Dragons Tooth, which is a very challenging rock formation I will get to hike down.  I plan on tenting at the hostel tomorrow night. I'll get a shuttle ride to the Catawba Grocery Store on Thursday morning, where my friend, Patricia, will pick me up so we can attend the ET&WNC Railroad Historical Society Convention in Johnson City, Tennessee, this weekend. I'm looking forward to seeing my railroad friends again. I should be back on the trail on Monday. Headed back to sleep now to be ready for another big day tomorrow.","Laurel Creek Shelter tent site

I had quite a hike today and packed a lot into those 11.7 miles. I was up as usual and ready to go by 7:30.  Juan Gone, who gets ready faster than I do in the morning, left at 7:15.  We said goodbye for now and gave each other a hug, since it's hard to know if we'll see each other again on the trail. Of course, it's a long way to Maine, and we do have each other's phone numbers.  I said goodbye to Just Susan, wished her luck, and hiked away.  Up the trail to the Audie Murphy Monument. . .  Sigh.  Will I ever learn?  I walked back down to the AT and headed north.  As Just Susan indicated, the first several miles were easy. I saw several squirrels and heard many more scurrying about. I also saw another deer. I got water at Trout Creek.  I had a little less than a pint left when I got there, so it was a good thing I packed extra water to the campsite. I then made the climb up Cove Mountain. At the top, the fun began.  I worked my away across numerous large rock formations.  Often, the only way to tell which way the trail went was to head toward the next blaze painted on either a tree or the rocks themselves. Along the way, I met fellow thru hikers, Karma and B.B. King. Karma is from Roanoke and has already hiked this section many times.  There was one particularly challenging rock scramble where I couldn't find a blaze or see where the trail went.  Karma and B.B. King were behind me and graciously pointed me in the right direction as I moved aside to let them pass.  After two miles of hiking the ridgeline, I came to the side trail to Dragons Tooth.  Dragons Tooth is a huge stone monolith that towers in the sky.  Karma and B.B. King were eating lunch at its base. Karma told me that some people climb to the top of the Tooth.  I checked the Guidebook (not really) to confirm that the AT did not run up the Tooth and was content with photographing it.  I walked back to the AT and ate my lunch before tackling the descent from Dragons Tooth.  I had been warned that it was very tricky and easy to get confused and off trail.  Coming down that section was amazing. There were two places where metal hoops have been driven into the rock faces to aid in getting down them. Everywhere else, it was up to you to figure it out. There were several places where I literally crept along a three inch wide ledge on the rock face for many feet as I worked my way down to the next level.  At one notable spot, it took me several minutes to figure out what to do as I clung to the side of the rock face and tried to puzzle it out. The obvious route led to a dead end, a five foot sheer drop to the surface below.  I finally realized that I needed to go up a different ledge which led to another ledge only three feet below it. I was then able to follow that ledge down to the lower ledge which allowed me to drop only a few feet onto the floor of that section.  In addition, there were steep rock staircases and jumbles of boulders to circumnavigate.  I chose to sit on my butt several times and scoot along a slanted boulder and then slide to the level below.  All the while, I needed to keep a sharp eye out for blazes, since it was quite possible to go the wrong way, usually in a direction that, at least initially, seemed easier. It was an absolute blast.  I know that the more nimble hikers probably weren't as challenged as this old, stove up man, but it was both a physical and a mental puzzle to make it down.  After getting to the end of the most challenging descent, I then hiked the two more miles that were only punctuated with rock and boulder crossings to Newport Road. Here I met E-Brake, who had just finished a twelve mile trail run on the AT.  It turns out that she works at the Four Pines Hostel, where I stayed tonight.  We walked the 0.3 miles together.  A past thru hiker (2015), she has also completed the PCT.  Four Pines is a wonderfully laid back  and informal hostel.  You pay by donation, except for laundry. I went in with two other hikers to cover the laundry fee. There is a beautiful grassy area behind the main building, and I opted to sleep in my tent. I learned that there was a shuttle leaving in a few minutes to the store, so I delayed my shower to go along.  I bought a large pizza, two large Gatorades, a banana, two cans of beer, a bag of Doritoes, and a cowtail (there was a display by the cash register).  Knowing that my hydration and calorie needs were temporarily met, we headed back to the hostel.  There were several hikers chilling by the main building, and Diogenes and Turquoise were there. I learned that Diogenes is an accomplished Jazz musician and singer.  He performed a bluesy version of ""Billy Jean,"" which was spot on.  I took a shower, collected my laundry, and headed for my tent just as the rain began.  With fresh laundry and a clean me, Patricia will be spared the experience of hiker funk for our three hour ride to Johnson City tomorrow.   It will be odd getting off the trail after fifty-five days, but I am really looking forward to the convention and seeing my railroad friends.  I passed the 700 mile mark today (denoted quite delicately on the trail with flower petals) and am only a few miles from being one-third done.  The rain has pretty much subsided now as I wrap this up for the night.  I feel pretty pumped about the day and that I was too busy to remember my fear of heights as I worked my way down those rock faces. We all face real challenges in life, and I feel so blessed that I am able to take on a chosen challenge (let's face it, no one forces you to hike 2,191 miles). Perhaps this experience is giving me a deeper appreciation for those confronting the very real challenges that life has a way of throwing at us. On that note, I wish everyone reading this a peaceful and blessed good night.","Stealth Campsite near Audie Murphy Monument

Today, I got off the trail for the weekend to attend the annual East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad Historical Society Convention in Johnson City, Tennessee.  I believe I have mentioned before that I have a large model railroad in my basement based on the ET&WNC, also known as the ET and as the Tweetsie Railroad.  I woke up at my regular time but was in no real hurry.  I had arranged for a shuttle to the grocery store for 10:00, where my friend, Patricia, planned on meeting me so we could drive to Johnson City for the convention.  The rain had stopped during the night, and my tent was completely dry when I took it down.  I got a chance to visit briefly with Bob, the owner of the hostel (along with his wife, Donna) although he wasn't interested in having his picture taken.  Soway and E-Brake are part of the hostel family as well.  They met while hiking the PCT.  Like I said earlier, there is a laid back, welcoming openness about Four Pines that really just needs to be experienced. I had a long talk with E-Brake this morning about children with special needs and how best to help meet their needs and the needs of their families.  She is truly a thoughtful, insightful, and caring woman.  I packed up my stuff and said goodbye to Cumen, whom I tented next to last night.  Cumen came to Four Pines several days ago with a badly infected toe and is staying there until it heals.  Soway then shuttled me to the grocery store after dropping off two hikers and E-Brake, who was going for another run. I purchased a tub of ice cream, a bottle of orange juice, a can of V-8 Juice, and a bottle of Gatorade, as I waited for Patricia. Patricia is a special kind of Trail Angel.  I did not see how I could possibly attend the ET convention this year since I was on the trail. I told Patricia I was going to miss the convention, and she said I wasn't.  She volunteered to pick me up wherever I was and to take me back after the convention. This involves several hours of extra driving on her part. We had a great three-hour drive to Johnson City and caught up with each other.  We got to the Carnegie Hotel, checked in, and then went to lunch at Smokey Bones.  We had a wonderful server named Caira, who was very excited when she learned I was thru hiking. She loves hiking and the outdoors and hopes to do long distance hiking one day.  She actually caused me to break a promise I made to myself a decade ago.  When I became an administrator and became inundated with paperwork, I swore that when I thru hiked, the only paperwork I would have anything to do with would involve bodily functions. I'll blow my nose and wipe my tookus, and that was it.  All receipts would be refused or immediately thrown away.  Caira wrote such a sweet note on my receipt that I will keep it with my trail  mementos. After we ordered, I got a call from my friend Sharon from Missouri. She has been a dear friend for many years.  Her late husband, John, was instrumental in the formation of the historical society and, along with my friend Chris, published ""The Blue Ridge Sidewinder,"" the society's magazine, for twenty years.  They also published a book of that name.  Sharon will be giving the keynote address tomorrow.  She met us at the restaurant,  and I then received a huge surprise.  My wife, Sandy, had come with her.  I was completely speechless with surprise.  We then went back to the hotel until dinner,  which was at an excellent Mexican restaurant. We were joined by Chris, Denise, Curtis, Cindy, Fred, and Joel, all members of the historical society. Everyone was a little amazed by how much I was eating.  Hiker Hunger lives on!  After we ate, Sandy, Patricia, and I went to Kroger so I could resupply.  It was then back to the hotel.  It is a little strange being off the trail after so long, but I am really excited about the upcoming convention and with being with my railroad friends and, of course, with Sandy.","VA 624, Newport Road/Four Pines Hostel

The first day of the convention was quite a success and a lot of fun.  Patricia and I went to McDonald's for breakfast (Sandy decided to sleep in).  After I consumed two Egg McMuffins and a large coffee, we headed to Mahoney's Outfitters so I could resolve a few gear issues. I met Dave Ramsey, the weekend manager, who noted that we both share our names with someone famous. He is very knowledgeable about equipment and about the AT in particular. He has been active in the conservation of local lands and has provided aid to many hikers.  We had a good conversation about trail conditions, conservation efforts, and American Chestnuts, and he was able to help me resolve my gear issues. Patricia and I returned to the hotel.  Later, Sandy, Patricia, and I went to the Train Show at ETSU.  There were many vendors and several modular layouts on display.  Sandy bought me an ET&WNC Transportation t-shirt for an early Father's Day present. I met my friend, Fred Alsop, at the train show.  Sandy and Patricia returned to the hotel, while Fred and I walked to the George L. Carter Railroad Museum. This museum houses a large, beautifully rendered, and historically accurate model railroad depicting the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad. I always look forward to seeing the progress they have made since my last visit.  The layout building team, headed up by Fred, who in his spare time is a world-renowned ornithologist with many books to his credit, continue to make remarkable progress on this massive project. This last year was no exception.  There is now an incredibly intricate and faithfully executed model of the iron mine complex that existed at Cranberry, North Carolina.  Other progress is being made as well, and it was so cool to watch (and hear) Locomotive 11 pull a freight train through the many towns and through the massive Doe River Gorge.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Last year, the team constructed a model of the store at Shell Creek based on a nearly 100 year old photograph, which also depicted a family posing in front.  A young girl stands on a platform somewhat removed from the rest of the family.  That young woman, now 106 years old, viewed the model a few months ago.  She asked, ""Is that me standing on that platform?""  Fred asssured her that it was. ""My coat was red not blue,"" was her reply.  Of course, the photograph was black and white, so there was no other way to know.  When Fred showed me the scene today, you'd better believe her coat was now red.  There has been another major addition to the museum as well. Sharon has donated John's tremendous model of the Carnegie Iron Furnace to the museum, and the museum team was able to extract the huge model from Sharon's basement in Jefferson City, Missouri, load it into a truck, haul it to Johnson City, Tennessee, and establish it in its new home.  This model is a different scale from the rest of the railroad, so it resides in its own place of honor to be viewed separately from the rest of the layout.  This model railroad is a work of art and is available for viewing by the public.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in railroads, model railroads, and/or Appalachian history.  Sharon also donated John's extensive photo and document collection to the museum, where they too can be accessed by interested parties.  After my visit to the museum, I returned to the hotel.  The society's business meeting was at 5:00, and a delicious dinner was served at 6:00.  And, yes, I did go back for seconds on everything including dessert.  After all, I will be returning to the trail in a few days. After dinner, Sharon gave a powerful, touching speech about the early history of the society and about John's major role in its creation. She also discussed the magazine he created (along with my friend, Chris Ford) and about his model rendition of the ET. It was a beautiful tribute to a unique and incredible man.  After the meeting ended, several of us headed for the bar for a drink and to reminisce a bit more.Today was a very full day, and tomorrow promises to be the same.  While I'm not hiking the trail for a few days, I consider my attendance and involvement in the convention as part of my overall adventure.  Two more days of railroading, and then I, with my new shoes, will again be on the trail.","Carnegie Hotel, Johnson City, Tennessee

Today was another busy day at the convention.  Instead of little toys, however, today was a day for big ""toys.""  We had breakfast at 7:00 at the hotel and were joined by Gizmo and Melanie. As I discussed in an earlier entry, Gizmo and Melanie were the first people I met when I started the trail back on April 7th, and.learned back.then that he was from Johnson City.  They were in town taking care of business and met us for breakfast. It was a very special merging of trail and trains.  We had a great time, and they got to meet Sandy.  After breakfast, Gil Williams gave a presentation on Combine car #15, a very unique railroad car. The 15 ran on the railroad to the very end in 1950 and is 1/3 passenger car, 1/3 baggage car, and 1/3 Railroad Post Office car.  The 15 turns 100 years old this year and is being restored in Spencer, North Carolina. After Gil's presentation, Sandy, Patricia, and I went to the museum, where I met up with my old friend, Ken. He was visiting the museum with his wife, daughter, and grandson.  Ken is an accomplished modeler and an overall great guy.  From there we drove to Newland for another 100 birthday party, this time for the Linville Depot. Along the way, I fulfilled a promise and stopped by Doe River Hiker Rest Hostel in Roan Mountain to say hi to Dave. It was great to see him again as he shuttled yet another hiker back to the trail.  We arrived in Newland in time for the depot's festivIties. After the railroad ceased operation in 1950, the depot was moved and turned into a personal residence .  It lost its depot look, along with its chesnut bark siding. In the late 1990s, it was scheduled for demolition, when the historical society stepped in and acquired the building and had it moved to Newland.  The restoration effort, spearheaded by Jerry Turbyfill, has been a huge success. Since American Chestnut bark is obviously unavailable  (for now!), the depot is now covered in poplar bark.  It is a beautiful restoration that represents thousands of hours of volunteer work by many people.  We attended a ceremony commemorating the depot's centennial birthday.  We also learned that two other southern staples, Moon Pies and Cheerwine soda, also turn 100 this year.  Next to the depot is Caboose 505, which is also being restored.  From there, it was off to our third, and last, 100 year birthday party: Engine #12.  We drove to the Tweetsie Railroad Amusement Park in Blowing Rock, North Carolina.  The 12, built in 1917, operated on the ET&WNC until 1950, and eventually found her way back to the North Carolina mountains when she was acquired by Tweetsie, where she has faithfully pulled passenger cars filled with happy children and their parents around a picturesque three-mile track since 1957.  The 12 is under repair right now, but Tweetsie's other locomotive, the Yukon Queen, filled in for her sister.  We were able to ride behind the locomotive for several trips around the mountain, and the crew let us out by the trestle for photographing a run-by.  As many times as I have done this, it never gets old.  After our train ride, we were treated to a banquet of fried chicken, ham, and all the fixings at the Tweetsie Palace.  The convention ends tomorrow with a train ride up the Doe River Gorge and a walk along the Tweetsie Trail. I'll be saying goodbye to Sandy and Sharon tomorrow morning, and will be back on the trail by Monday.","Carnegie Hotel, Johnson City, Tennessee

We had another beautiful.day for the conclusion of the convention.  I said goodbye to Sharon and to Sandy this morning. It was so good to see Sandy, and I so loved her surprise appearance.  It reminded me what a special woman she is that she supports me on this six-month adventure I am on. I love you, Sandy!  The convention continued with our annual train trip up the Doe River Gorge.  We met at 9:45.  Unlike the last few years, the weather cooperated, and we enjoyed a sunny but cool trip. The jouney began as the train traversed one tunnel, travelled atop some long fills, and then wenr through a second tunnel.  The little diesel locomotive then worked its way up  the grade to near Pardee Point. I will never tire of beholding the sheer size and beauty of the Doe River Gorge.  The rock faces tower over us and our train.  The model of the Gorge in my basement nearly reaches the ceiling, but if I could truly build it to scale, the top would be in the attic. Somehow, I doubt Sandy would approve. Due to rail conditions, we switched to the little speeder locomotive at Pardee Point to continue up to the bridges.  Some of us opted to walk this section.  Jane, Patricia, Fred, and I walked, and Fred  was able to call our attention to different types of birds by the calls we could hear.  There are many types of warblers in the Gorge, and they all have their own, distinctive voice.  We reached the east end of the steel deck truss, which is the present-day end of the line.  I have modeled this bridge, and I always enjoy seeing it again.  Just past it, the railroad used to immediately enter a tunnel and then crossed the Doe River again on a steel thru truss.  All of this within a few hundred yards. Once, years ago, I crossed the bridge to walk through the tunnel and view the other bridge.  This is not allowed today and, considering the condition of the bridge, I was more than happy to comply.  If we could cross it and the other bridge, there is then one other tunnel (partially collapsed), another thru truss bridge (still used for car traffic), a few miles of narrow road through some dramatic rock cuts, and we would be at the Doe River Hiker Rest Hostel.  Instead, we spent some time at the bridge before making the return trip to Hampton.  After the trip, some goodbyes were said before a group of us went for our final activity of the convention, a walk on the Tweetsie Trail.  The section of the ET&WNC from Johnson City to Elizabethtown survived as the standard gauge East Tennessee Railway until the late 1990s.  When it ended operation, the roadbed was converted into a walking and biking trail called the Tweetsie Trail.  It is a beautiful effort and runs nearly ten miles.  We walked along the section that passes the old limestone quarry (mostly filled with water) and where students used to disembark to attend Milligan College. Numerous historical markers have recently been added thanks in large part to Fred and ETSU.  We discussed having our society sponsor additional markers.  After our walk, Patricia and I drove back to Johnson City so I could see the old train depot there.  For many years after the narrow gauge ended, the depot housed a tire dealership and was altered so its railroad heritage was scarcely noticeable.  A few years ago it was purchased by the Yee Haw Brewery, who restored it to its original look.  Now housing the brewery and the White Duck Taco Shop, the depot is a distinctive and beautiful structure.  The Clinchfield depot across the street has also be converted into a restaurant and work has begun to restore the old railroad hotel into office space.  From there, we returned to the hotel where I worked on packing and took a short, although hard, nap.  Later, I went to dinner with Patricia, Chris, Denise, Fred, and Joel and discussed the convention and plans for the future.  As I write this in the hotel early the next morning, I am hours away from getting back on the trail. I have enjoyed the convention immensely, and I have really enjoyed seeing old friends and making new ones.  Seeing Sandy was one of the greatest surprises I have had in a long time.  I am now four days behind the people I have been seeing on the trail, but I look forward to meeting new hikers.  Gravity also took a few days off last week, and I will be meeting him in Catawba.  Full of happy memories of the convention, as well as full of all of the banquet and restaurant food I have been eating, I'm back on the trail today.","Carnegie Hotel, Johnson City, Tennessee

The convention was a huge success, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but the time has come to get back on the trail.  Patricia and I left Johnson City at 7:30 and drove through a steady rain back to Catawba.  We met Gravity at Four Pines Hostel at 10:30, and Patricia then took us to the trail junction at Newport Road.  I thanked her again as we said goodbye, since she is the only reason I was able to attend the convention.  Thanks, Patricia! I hope you continue to enjoy Spam Singles! Gravity and I hiked through a steady rain from 11:00 until just before we called it a day at the Catawba Mountain Shelter tent site a little after 3:30. My new shoes were dry for less than thirty minutes.  They are very comfortable, though. I enjoyed hiking through fields of cows which we entered through stiles and through gates that used springs to make sure they stayed closed. One group of cows were clustered directly on the trail, and it took awhile to convince them to move along and share the trail.  I hiked 7.9 miles and decided to call it a day due to the weather. We are less than two miles from McAfee Knob, one of the best known and most photographed locations on the AT.  The forecast is for the rain to end this evening with clearing skies tomorrow.  It is 17.8 miles to the next resupply stop in Daleville which is certainly doable in a day.  The plan is to get up early, hopefully have good views at McAfee Knob, and then finish up in Daleville tomorrow evening.  It didn't take me long to get back into a hiking rhythm. The trail was pretty typical with some rock scrambling but not too much.  I saw a deer as it burst across the trail in front of me, and a few frogs as they hopped across the trail in front of me. The deer was in all kinds of hurry, but the frogs didn't mind sharing a few minutes of time and posing for photos.  As I lie here in my tent, a whipporwill is singing outside.  It's the first one I have heard on the trip. The rain started up awhile ago but has once again stopped.  Hopefully, there will be good photo opportunities tomorrow morning on McAfee Knob, but, whether there are or not, the hike continues. I'm back at it and have no other scheduled interruptions, so, hopefully, I will continue my slow but steady progress all the way to Katahdin.","VA 624, Newport Road/Four Pines Hostel

Today is June 6th, and I would like to begin by wishing my son, Greg, a very happy birthday. Greg lives in England with his wonderful wife, Kathryn, and his beautiful, bright, baby daughter (and Sandy's and my first grandchild), Rose.  Happy Birthday, Greg!  I woke up early, which isn't a surprise since I went to bed so early last night.  The whipporwill was still at it this morning. The sky was clear, and it turned into a perfect day for hiking. Gravity and I left for McAfee Knob at 7:00.  The hike to the knob was largely uphill and not too hard to hike.  The sun was up, facing the spot where the photos of people in the knob are taken. Photos taken at this time tend to render silhouettes.  I am very pleased at how mine turned out.  I enjoyed walking around the area and looking at the views.  We then set out for the Tinker Cliffs, five miles away.  The Tinker Cliffs offer spectacular views of the valley below and the ranges of mountains in the distance.  It is also possible to see a tiny grey spot on top of one mountain; McAfee Knob. While eating lunch on top of the cliff, I met Scooby, another thru hiker who hails from Johnson City, Tennessee.  He sat down and removed his shirt due to the heat.  It was quite cool all day in the shade of the forest but warm in the sun. Gravity walked by and commented that Scooby had been a Boy Scout.  I immediately inquired what aura about Scooby led Gravity to this insight, as I was impressed when Scooby answered that he had been.  It seems that Scooby has a Philmont Scout Reservation logo tatooed on his back.  He worked at the ranch for six years and is also an Eagle Scout. Scooby also informed me of the inherent danger of giving a friend the trail name, Shaggy.  I told him at least he isn't known as Velma. The trail follows the cliffs for a half of a mile, with one spectacular view after another.  At one point, I saw a vulture fly up to a branch and land.  I was able to creep quite close before it chose to launch itself back into the air stream in its search for dead stuff.  It was quite a sight to watch from above as it took to flight. After the cliffs, the trail follows the ridge of the mountain for over five miles on its way to Daleville.  The way was very challenging at times, with numerous opportunities to work one's way through rock scrambles of all shapes and sizes.  Sometimes you go around them, sometimes you squeeze through them, and oftentimes you find ways to work your way over rhem.  It's as much a mental as a physical challenge. We were again greeted with many fantastic views as we worked our way along the ridge. The trail descends rather steeply the last two and a half miles into Daleville.  The last two miles were easy trail and made for a nice conclusion to the day.  Only a few minutes from town, a little doe darted across the path in front of me.  Rather than continue into the woods, she paused, turned back, and looked at me.  I talked gently to her and was even able to take a picture in which she is sort of visible before she decided she'd had enough and bounded into the woods.  Less than five minutes after this exchange, the trail crosses US Highway 220 at Daleville.  The contrast was somewhat jarring.  I really appreciate when the trail actually enters a town. This makes it possible to resupply without having to figure out a shuttle or other way to get off trail and to a place you can purchase needed supplies  (mostly food).  Gravity, Scooby, Speedy, and I got a room at the Super 8, which has a very economical hiker rate.  We then went to the Three Li'l Pigs Barbecue for dinner and then to Kroger for resupply.  Back to the hotel to sort everything out and get to bed.  Today was an idyllic day for hiking, with mild weather, clear skies, and spectacular views.  Of course, anyone hiking this stretch yesterday did it in the rain and fog.  I guess this is one reason why it is said the hike hikes you more than you hike the hike. Tomorrow's forecast is for more beautiful weather, but rain and shine are all part and parcel of the AT.  I'll have plenty more of both,  I'm sure.","Catawba Mountain Shelter Tent site

There are two milestones I met today.  Today is my two-month anniversary of being on the trail, and, although there were no markers along the trail, I am now over one-third of the way to the end.  I slept okay at the Super 8 and was up at 6:30.  I filled up on Raisin Bran, yogurt, and make-your-own waffles at the Continental Breakfast.  It's difficult getting an early start from town, but Gravity and I were back on the trail at 8:05.  We hiked together for awhile, but then I hiked ahead, and we didn't see each other again until late evening in camp.  I was surprised at how good the trail was leaving Daleville. In fact, I believe today was the easiest trail I have hiked along the entire AT so far.  Granted, there were many steep ascents and descents, some of them quite severe, as we are, after all, still in the mountains.  However, the entire 18.5 mile section I hiked today was surprisingly devoid of major rock scrambling.  Not that there wasn't the opportunity.   Numerous times the trail approached a large rock formation, and I would get ready to start climbing and scrambling.  But every time, the trail skirted the rocks, sometimes almost daintily, and bypassed the formation.  A few times the trail passed through, but chose not to climb over, the rocks and boulders. It's almost as though a kinder and gentler hand laid out today's trail. I saw a bumper sticker a few days ago that read, ""Virginia is for Lovers."" Perhaps the trail engineer for today's trail loved hikers or, at the least, decided to go easy on us for today.  After the third time of skirting a rock formation, I actually voiced my concern to the trail:  ""What are you, and what did you do to my AT?""  I've voiced this concern once before on a short mile-long section, but this sentiment lasted the entire day.  Seriously, I know there will be many more challenging and difficult days ahead, but the trail today was surprisingly good, and I made excellent time.  A few miles into the day, as I crossed through a fence stile, I passed the one-third mark on my way to Katahdin.  In many ways, it doesn't seem possible. The two months I have been on the trail have flown by.  As I said, I made excellent time today and set a steady pace which I kept up all day long.  If I am hiking the same pace without difficulty at mile eighteen as I was at mile one, then I feel I've found a good pace.  As I mentioned, there were many ascents and descents today, and this afternoon led me to the AT's intersection with the Blue Ridge Parkway.  My family and I drove on the Parkway several times years ago, and it provides a beautiful, meandering way through the mountains.  The trail crossed the Parkway three times today, at Taylor Mountain Overlook, at the Montvale Overlook, and at Harvey's Knob Overlook.  I made such good time today, that I remained at the Montvale Overlook for over half an hour, enjoying the view.  The sun had disappeared behind the clouds by then, and it was growing darker, but the views remained beautiful.  Several vehicles stopped, but everyone avoided the homeless guy with the scruffy beard and backpack. I had to chuckle remembering the last time I was on the Parkway.  The kids were young, and I was under my old 1970 Nova, parked at a scenic overlook in a cold, foggy downpour, trying to wire my muffler back up with a coat hanger so we could get to town. Ah, the memories.  Since getting on the trail, while atop many viewless summits, many hikers and I have joked that someone needs to cut down the darn trees so we can view nature. I discovered today, while hiking below several scenic overlooks, that this is indeed done. I hiked among piles of fallen trees, cut to provide views for the motorists above.  Despite taking my time at the overlooks, I still arrived at the Bobblets Gap Shelter area by 5:30.  Tent space was almost nonexistent, but I was able to squeeze my tent between the shelter building and a large tree.  I made sure to locate another spot on the other side of the shelter for Gravity, who arrived a bit before seven. What the shelter area lacks in tent space, it makes up for in privy-ness.  Virginia continues to outdo herself.  Our privy for this spot boasts a vent pipe, a sliding door latch, coat pegs, and disability support railings on the walls by the toilet seat. A doe wandered down out of the woods this evening, perhaps to check out the privy's accomodations, and was kind enough to stay long enough for a photograph.  I visited with Young Gandalf, Summer, and Cheese Steak (one guess where he is from) while I prepared and ate dinner.  Gravity showed up soon after.  It will be a far shorter day tomorrow, as the destination is the Middle Creek Campground only ten miles away.  They provide resupply and are rumored to have the best Bacon Cheeseburgers and Milkshakes around.  I feel duty bound to check this out.  As I write this in the wee hour of 12:30 am, a steady rain has started to fall, so tomorrow may be a walk in Liquid Sunshine.  Like I said last night, all part and parcel of this adventure.  I'm going to sleep now to see what tomorrow will bring.","US 220, Daleville, Virginia

The rain stopped sometime during the night, and I awoke to singing birds and partly cloudy skies. My tent was already dry by the time I took it down.  I was on the trail by 7:50. Today was a short day, as I planned on going to Middle Creek Campground, which is only about ten miles down the trail.  Gravity and I hiked together for awhile this morning. The trail continued as it had yesterday and skirted most of the big rocks and boulders we passed.  I have startes seeing a new type of flower.  Called Galax, this flower sports delicate, pointy flower petals that are quite beautiful and add a nice splash of color to the green tunnel.  I saw another doe this morning who stood for a few moments surveying us before sprinting into the woods.  The trail crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway again, but the mist had closed in so there were no views.  The trail continued to be relatively free of rocks, and there were sections that looked like rocks had actually been moved to help clear the trail. We came across a group of about half a dozen day hikers hiking south back to their cars.  They told us that they were all part of the group that maintains this section of the AT.  We thanked them and congratulated them on the excellent job they were doing. One woman asked if we had noticed the privies.  I told her that they were the best I'd seen on the entire trail, and she told me her husband was responsible for seven of them and had used cedar that he cut and formed himself for the assistance rails beside the toilet seats.  This man has done fantastic work, and if it sounds like I am perseverating on privies, they truly are a vital part of helping to manage human influence in the wild.  Although I see surprisingly few hikers right now, with all of the thru hikers, section hikers, and day hikers, these trails see tremendous use.  By providing privies in shelter/camping areas, the waste problem is largely controlled. Otherwise, these areas would be surrounded by hundreds of catholes. Unfortunately, many hikers are not all that conscientious about digging catholes, and I see many toilet paper ""flowers"" in the shelter areas that lack a privy.  So, as long as I can, I plan on utilizing the Taj Mahal of trail privies that this woman's husband has provided.  Gravity and I split up for awhile, and I hiked alone the last few miles to the Highway 614 bridge over Jennings Creek.  I observed one other nifty piece of trail work.  On the way down grade to the highway, the AT crosses the Buchanan Trail, which is open to horse travel and bicycles.  Maintainers have constructed an effective fence and stile structure that looks rustic but also effectively discourages horses and bikes from gaining access to the AT, which is open to foot traffic only.  Interestingly, some of the signs that prohibit equine and bike travel, also list hang gliders. I'm not sure how a hang glider could possibly be wrangled up to these places, but I guess it is better to be safe than sorry.  In very good time, I reached the Jennings Creek bridge. Gravity was right behind me.  We called for a shuttle to the Middle Creek Campground, and Luke from the campground was there in a few minutes.  We pitched our tents in a pretty grass area right next to a creek, but not before enjoying the bacon cheeseburgers for which they are rightfully famous. I also had fries, an ice cream cone (double scoop), and two Gatorades. Makenzie made our burgers and also made us feel right at home.  I spent the rest of the day purchasing resupply items (and, yes, they have Spam Singles!), airing out and organizing my equipment, resting, and eating.  For dinner I had a grilled chicken sandwich and a strawberry milk shake. Oh, and onion rings. And a Three Musketeers Bar.  And another Gatorade.  Hiker Hunger continues to be a very real thing, and I find myself getting hungry on the trail more frequently and earlier than before. This is apparently a normal occurrence, and I am working at getting more calories into my food supplies but also make sure I ""tank up"" every chance I get. I feel great and have lots of energy for hiking, but I have lost 20 pounds in the last two months.  After dinner, I took a shower and headed for bed.  Bedtime is early tonight, as I plan on a big day of 20.9 miles tomorrow.  I plan on getting to Waynesboro by Thursday or maybe Friday of next week, as my good friend and hiking buddy, Mike, plans to join me through the Shenandoahs.  It will be great to see him and hike with him.","Bobblets Gap Shelter Tent Site

My plans for a big mileage day began to go south early this morning (pun intended).  I suppose I could have eaten my instant oatmeal and cereal bar and gotten a shuttle back to the trail earlier, but the cafe at the campground opened at 8:00 and was offering two eggs, a sausage patty, biscuits and gravy, and hash brown potatoes for $4.50.  Katahdin isn't going anywhere, and the breakfast was delicious. As it was, km Gravity, Redeye, and I got a ride after breakfast and were on the trail at 9:10.  The trail continued to be good, and I made good time up and over Fork Mountain.  I met Namaste and Neptune as they were packing up at a stealth campsite.  Namaste means: ""The light in me acknowledges the light in you."" What a beautiful trail name.  Neptune is Namaste's boyfriend, who recently joined her after graduating with a bachelor's degree in English from Harvard.  A self-proclaimed Shakespeare geek, Neptune and I discussed which were our favorite and least favorite of the plays.  He told me about his favorite source for audio renditions of the plays, and I recommended Ian Doescher's Shakespearean rewrites of the original Star Wars series, beginning with, ""Verily, A New Hope.""  This wonderfully whimsical take on the Star Wars saga, is written as if by the Bard himself. The cover of the first play shows Darth Vader in a ruffed collar. R2D2 plays the role of the Shakespearean fool, and beeps and clicks to the other players, but offers astute and satirical asides to the audience.  Yoda presented a problem, since the wise Jedi Master speaks in Elizabethan English already, he does, so Doescher has him speak only in Haiku. I am obviously a huge fan of these works, and strongly recommend them to anyone, but especially Shakespeare fans.  As you might guess, my visit with these two young people delayed my hiking progress a bit.  The trail passed through a very brushy and grassy area, and I was very pleased that the trail maintainers had cut back the brush for about two feet on both sides of the trail. Wide Sky, a fellow thru hiker, happened by as I was photographing this trail work, so I included him in the photo.  I began to think as I hiked along.  In the grand scheme of things, is there any difference in cutting down plants for hikers' convenience and cutting down plants (in this instance, trees) for motorists' convenience on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Probably not.  I also encountered a new plant today.  It sports pretty purple flowers that grow on tendrils that appear to grow around and choke the leaves of the plant.  I looked carefully, and the flowers and leaves are definitely from the same plant. At several times today, the rhododendron petals had fallen so thickly on the trail that it looked like a flower girl from a wedding had passed by right before I got there.  It was quite a pretty sight. On the wildlife side of things, I saw a pair of black snakes, several squirrels, and a large snail today.  I was treated to a few views from overlooks today.  I met Skywalker (and, yes, his first name is Luke) at Black Rock Overlook. He was perched on the rock, just taking in the view.  I joined him for a bit before continuing down the trail.  Any chance of making the 20 miles I had originally planned ended when I reached the side trail for Apple Orchard Falls and decided to go look at the Falls, which are over a mile from the AT.  I left a note for Gravity, who was somewhere behind me, but he showed up just as I was heading down the blue-blazed trail, and we hiked down together. He later jokingly complained that I added over a mile of uphill hiking to his day, to which I replied that I also added over a mile of downhill hiking as well.  The extra trip was definitely worth it. While there weren't the 604 steps like at Amacolala Falls, there had to be at least 100 built into the trail to the foot of the falls, which features a 200 foot waterfall.  The deck work at the foot of the falls is impressive as well, and it was worth every minute of the two hours we spent off the AT to experience the sight.  It was then up to the top of Apple Orchard Mountain, where an FAA tower, which looks like a giant golf ball, is located.  I remet Namaste and Neptune again as they were setting up camp for the night.  Neptune told me of a view that looked back over the last 100 miles that we had traveled, so I cut through some trees and climbed some large boulders to look.  Another great view. After bidding farewell to Namaste and Neptune with a heartfelt, ""Once more into the breech!"" I continued down the trail to the Guillotine, a large boulder wedged between two rock walls.  The trail passes directly under the boulder, which provides a perfect photo opp.  I waited by the rock for Gravity, so we could take each other's photos.  By this time it was getting late, and I showed up at the Thunder Hill Shelter at 7:45.  I decided this was far enough for today.  I was a little worried about the water supply, but there is a small spring that continually fills a small stone box.  It is unlike any other water source I've come across, but the water was clear and easy to filter.  Gravity showed up a bit later, and we set up our tents near the spring.   It was dark by the time I got in my tent, and I only ""accomplished"" fourteen miles on the AT today, but it was a very full, very wonderful day on the trail.  The plan is to get up early tomorrow to complete the 14.6 miles to Glasgow in time to get into town for resupply.","Jennings Creek Bridge/Middle Creek Campground

I woke up and got going early this morning, because I needed to be in the town of Glasgow today for resupply.  Due to not getting as far as planned yesterday, there were 14.6 miles to cover today, and it's important to get into town early enough to get everything done.  I made sure Gravity was awake as well, and we were ready to hit the trail by 7:00.  I headed out first and made good time the first six miles. I hiked awhile with Long Fish, whom I met last night.  He and I have identical hiking shirts, and it turns out he also runs marathons.  The similarity ends there, however, as his best time is 2 hours, 29 minutes (mine is 5 hours and 3 minutes).  Our hiking speeds ended up reflecting our running speeds, and he soon hiked away from me.  I participated in a bit of good luck/Trail magic today.  Yesterday, I came across a toothbrush lying on the trail.  It looked just like the one I had seen Red Eye using that morning at the campground, so I picked it up and placed it in a Ziploc bag to see if it was hers.  This morning, I came across her as she was leaving the Harrison Ground Spring camping area, three miles into my hike. She was in the process of getting on the trail; if I had been two minutes later, I never would have seen her since she hikes appreciatively faster than I do.  I asked her if she had lost her toothbrush, and she told me no, but that another hiker she camped with last night had.  So I was able to reacquaint this hiker with his toothbrush in a bit of dental trail magic.  Fortunately, I already have a trail name, or I might have become Tooth Fairy.  I made good time for the first six miles, but then the hike up Highcock Knob proved pretty difficult.  It was almost like getting reacquainted with an old friend, as the tough, rock scrambling climb was back. Although steep and rocky, the ascent was only for 1.2 miles, and the rest of the day was more like the new normal.  Gravity caught up with me at the top of Highcock Knob, and we arranged a shuttle for 3:30 from the trail at the James River Footbridge to Glasgow, which is five miles off trail.  We discussed hitching, but decided that for $15 for the pair of us, we would take the shuttle.  The rest of the day from the summit of Highcock Knob to the James River Footbridge was largely downhill.  There were some impressive views of the James River from high on the ridge, but these views did not lend themselves to photos due to the tree cover.  The last mile ran parallel to the James, which is a relatively large river.  The AT crosses the James on the longest foot-traffic only bridge on the trail.  Converted from an old railroad bridge, it is very impressive.  My understanding is that before this bridge was made available, hikers crossed the James on the highway bridge.  Gravity and I got to the bridge in plenty of time to take some photos.  Just after I crossed the bridge, a CSX train thundered by just a few feet from where I was standing.  The AT crosses under the bridge, so I also was able to stand under the train and feel the vibrations of its power.  We then got to the parking lot and visited with some kayakers until our shuttle driver arrived.  He took us into Glasgow, where we stayed at the free Hikers' Village.  The town of Glasgow provides free accommodations for hikers in the city park.  Built initially as an Eagle Scout project, the village consists of a pavilion with sleeping facilities, a tenting area, a hot shower, and privies.  I set up my tent and then took a shower.  Since there was no one else waiting to shower, I saved some time and money by washing my clothes in the shower. I hung them on the village's clothesline, to dry while I went to eat and resupply. Gravity and I ate at the local restaurant, which had delicious Italian food, and then resupplied at the two local grocery stores.  We need provisions to get all the way to Waynesboro, so my pack will be quite heavy for the four mile/2,300 foot elevation climb tomorrow morning. Before eating, however, I got my picture taken next to the large, fiberglass dinosaur that protects downtown Glasgow.  I'm not sure why it's there, but I bet it gets photographed a great deal.  I know that hikers benefit the local economy of Glasgow by shopping here and eating inordinate amounts of food at the local restaurant (I certainly did my part), but I feel Hiker Village is a wonderful gesture and is unlike any other place I have stayed on the trail. Gravity and I have an 8:00 shuttle scheduled back to the trail in the morning.  The temperature is forecast for the 90s tomorrow,  and for the first time, I am sleeping with my vestibule open.  Perhaps summer has finally arrived.  My good friend and hiking buddy, Mike, is meeting me in Waynesboro near the end of the week to hike the Shenandoahs with me.  More good times to come.  For now, it's time to go back to sleep to be ready for another day.","Thunder Hill Shelter Tent site

It cooled off a little during the nighr, and I ended up closing one of the vestibules and draping my quilt over me. I slept well and got up at the regular time, even though the shuttle didn't pick us up until 8:00.  This gave me plenty of time to get ready and to resort my food bag.  I had a bit of extra food.  Instead of carrying the extra weight, I left it on the table and let the other hikers know it was fair game.  It didn't last long.  Our shuttle driver was young  and enthusiastic and talkative, so it was an entertaining trip back to the trail. We started hiking at 8:15 and knew we had fifteen tough miles ahead.  Today reminded me of a roller coaster.  I hiked up and over five named mountains:  Little Rocky Row, Big Rocky Row, Bluff, Punchbowl, and Rice Mountains.  The ascent of each one was steep, rocky, and difficult.  The descent of each one was, for the most part, much more gradual and with better trail.  Up really steep and then down more gradual, like a roller coaster.  There were some very picturesque views along the way.  My favorite today was of the James River from the top of Rocky Row.  You can see the railroad tracks snaking along the edge of the river and, by chance, I happened to see a train moving along the rails.  If the movement hadn't caught my eye, there is no way I would have seen it.  I know it was just as loud and thunderous as the one the day before by the bridge, but I had climbed a long way up to see the one today, and it was quiet and almost invisible from my new vantage point.  I saw several new flowers today, and I also found some blackberries!  I ate a couple of the ripe ones but left the rest for other hikers and maybe a few bears.  I'm guessing that multi-floral roses are an invasive species here like they are at home, but they are certainly fragrant.  As the forecast promised, it was hot today.  There were periods of cooler breezes, and I was in the shade of the woods for the majority of the day, but it was still plenty warm.  There was an interesting and sad monument at the summit of Bluff Mountain, dedicated to the memory of little Ottie Cline Powell. On November 9, 1890, Ottie, who was four years and eleven months old, was sent out with the other students to collect firewood for the school's woodstove.  Ottie ""strayed"" from the school, and his body was found on April 5, 1891 at the top of Bluff Mountain, seven miles from the school.  I have a hard time imagining the poor little guy trudging up to the top of that mountain, but I don't believe there is any evidence on how his body got there.  Water availability continues to be a concern.  My two liters got me the 10.5 miles to the next available water at the Punchbowl Shelter (although the water poured from a piped spring and not a punchbowl).  I drank a liter there and filled all my bottles for the remaining 4.5 miles and made sure I drank a lot of water for the conclusion of today's hike.  I arrived at my destination, the Pedlar River Bridge, at 5:30.  This bridge is another really cool suspension bridge.  The guidebook lists camping 0.2 miles south of the bridge, but I never saw anything that looked campable there.  Instead, I located a little hidey hole under the rhododendron at the foot of the bridge that had just enough room for two tents.  There is a fire ring, so I certainly wasn't the first one to think of camping here.  Gravity showed up a bit after I arrived.  I cooked dinner on one of the concrete pads of the bridge, and we suspended our food bags under the bridge, but not over the water.  Just past the bridge, which I will officially cross tomorrow, is the 800 mile mark.  I crossed over to check (and also because it is fun crossing suspension bridges)  and there is an 800 written in stones on the trail. Tomorrow should be another big day.  There is only one mountain, but it entails a 3,100 foot elevation change over six miles.  There are apparently few available camping spots, and water will again be an issue.  I plan on hiking 18.9 miles to the north fork of the Piney River, with two available water stops, although one is located 0.3 miles from the trail.  I also believe it is supposed to be warm again. Today, while challenging, was very doable, and I expect tomorrow will prove the same.  On a bright note, my pack is lighter by one day's worth of food.  I'm listening now to the water of the Pedlar River flow by my tent and the croaking of bullfrogs, and I'm going to let this put me to sleep so I'll be ready for tommorow.","VA 130/James River Footbridge/Glasgow, Virginia

Well, I spent almost 12 hours at ""the office"" today, and what do I have to show for it?  Over 20 miles in and four encounters with trail magic.  I woke up a bit early and was on the trail by 6:45.  There weren't a lot of camping opportunities where I wanted to end up today and there was one major climb up Bald Knob (which is totally tree covered at the top) and a smaller climb up Cole Mountain (which is a bald).  I had planned to stop along Piney River, where the guidebook indicates camping spots, but it was in a low, marshy area and very damp and buggy.  Gravity and I discussed earlier the possibility of going on to the shelter area, which is a higher elevation with a spring, and not a stream, for a water source. Hence, I walked into Seeley-Woodworth Shelter area at 6:30, eleven hours and forty-five minutes after leaving my previous campsite.  When I am faced with a steep climb (and the four mile climb up Bald Knob was very steep), I say to myself, ""Just another day at the office.""  I was tired but in fine shape when I arrived this evening, but I don't like to string together too many long days in a row.  The number of hikers has certainly diminished since I began.  The shelter and tent area were empty when I got here, and Gravity and I are the only inhabitants tonight.  The only human ones anyway.  I read in the shelter log book that the mice are very friendly and will even climb into your hand. There were several pleas not to kill them.  I have heard a great deal of rustling around my tent tonight, but no mouse has attempted to gnaw its way in so I can pet it.  The day started out cooler than expected, and I made excellent time to the juntion with US 60, the highway into Buena Vista. I encountered my first example of trail magic as the trail came out at the road.  Some kind soul had left a case of bottled water, free to all hikers.  Water is one of the heaviest things we carry, and there are numerous dry sections lately, so any time you can get extra water that you didn't have to carry that you can just guzzle,  that is magic indeed.  There is an unspoken expectation that everyone only takes one, to share the magic with as many hikers as possible.  There was a picnic table at this junction, so I sat down to download yesterday's journal and send a few texts.  I was soon joined by a few other hikers, some just resting and others planning on going into Buena Vista to resupply.  It was then that I met my second Trail Angel of the day.  David drove up to meet his friend, Shawn, for a few days of hiking, and he pulled a cooler out of his vehicle full of ice cold Gatorade. I was never a fan of Gatorade until I started this adventure, but I am now a convert.  I gratefully took one from the cooler, and David also offered me a bag of Doritos.  Score.  David and Shawn agreed to pose for a photo of hiker kindness in action.  I soon hiked on, and I'm positive that the Gatorade, plus the way I procured it, helped power me up the long and very steep ascent of Bald Knob.  I met a turtle on the way up, and he calmly let me take his picture even after one of my trekking poles fell and almost hit him.  Later, I would meet my first bunny of the trip.  She hung around long enough for me to get out my phone, turn it on, and take a distance shot.  When I tried to move in for a close up, she was gone in a flash.  I also saw another deer today, who was feeding on the grass that the trail maintainers have been cutting along the trail.  I believe she had a fawn with her, but they quickly disappeared when I came into view.  The only other wildlife I saw today were flies and gnats.  Summer appears to have arrived in Virginia with a vengence, and I spent most of my day with a cloud of gnats keeping me company.  They don't really hurt anything, but they can be annoying. I hiked along with my cloud of new friends, and enjoyed my third meeting with trail magic at Hog Camp Gap, where the trail crosses UAFS Road 48. Here was another Trail Angel, whose only name he would give was Trail Angel. He said he was worried about the hikers in the heat, so he drove up to the trail with, you guessed it, ice cold Gatorade.  I am continually amazed  at the kindness of so many local people toward hikers.  I heard the whining noise of my fourth Trail Angel before I actually met him.  Logan, a volunteer with the Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club, is the finest kind of Trail Angel.  He was out in the heat trimming the undergrowth back from the trail.  Without such attention, in some areas the trail would be soon overwhelmed by grasses and other growth. I had a good chat with Logan about the trail in Virginia and told him I have been a member of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy since the year 2000.  He thanked me, and told me that the ATC had provided both the brush cutter that he was using and the protective chaps he was wearing. Shameless plug: if anyone who is reading this wants to help support the Appalachian Trail and its community, a great way to do this is to join the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  It's easy to do on-line, and, in addition to helping the ATC with their important work, you also receive a very well produced quarterly magazine full of information about the trail and beautiful photography.  Many thanks to Logan and the hundreds of other trail maintainers that make the AT possible. You guys and gals are the greatest!  I also encountered some  very interesting historical information on the trail today. In the early 1900s, a group of freed slaves established a community along Brown Mountain Creek.  There were two informational signs along the trail, and I saw several examples of stone work that is all that remains today.  At almost the very end of my hike today, I came across the last surprise of the day.  While I obviously miss my family and friends, perhaps Mother Nature felt I might be missing Missouri and St. Louis as well, because she provided me with my very own Arch to walk through on my way to my campsite.  I'm not sure how the poor tree was damaged to cause it to be bent like it was, but it was very cool to walk through it.  If only a Cardinal had been perched on top.  Oh well, you can't have everything.  I have a shorter day planned for tomorrow, which is good considering the length of my hike today.  I may have over 800 miles in, but it's still a long way to Katahdin."," A flat spot by the Pedlar River Bridge at Mile 799.9

I should have learned by now to never assume a day on the AT will be easy, because the trail can always show you a different way.  I woke up at 5:00 this morning but didn't stir until 5:45, since I knew I was only going a bit over fourteen miles today.  Still, I was on the trail by 7:30.  Within ten minutes of walking, I spied a doe grazing in the woods quite a ways from the trail. I stopped and watched her for several minutes.  If she was aware of my presence, she never let me know. I finally continued on up the steep but short climb to Spy Rock.  I had read that Spy Rock is a rock outcropping that requires intense climbing and a spotter is recommended for the way back down.  I decided to take the 0.1 mile side trail to at least look at the rock.  It is huge and formidable and, at least for me, not for climbing solo, if at all.  I was beginning my return to the trail when I came across Patch, who I haven't seen since the hostel in Bland.  As you may recall, Patch has a great deal of hiking experience on the AT in Virginia.  He told me of an alternate trail leading off to the left of Spy Rock that provides a way to the top from the backside.  I took the trail and was able to hike and climb my way to the top, although I ended up leaving my trekking poles behind to finish the climb using my hands and feet.  It was quite a view.  Upon beginning my return to the AT, I found my trekking poles without difficulty but got a bit confused concerning the return route.  I was able to work out a different route that brought me back to the face of the rock.  Back on the AT, I began the steep, rocky climb up Priest Mountain, or as it is commonly called, The Priest.  Just prior to the summit is a shelter where I stopped for water and to write in the shelter journal book.  All shelters have a journal.  In the days before cell phones, these journals played an important role in helping keep track of a hiker's progress.  In case of trouble, a hiker's location could be determined by checking the journals.  They are still a way to see when a friend passed through, and many hikers write witty and creative comments that are fun to read.  There is an AT tradition that hikers confess their trail sins by writing of them in the shelter journal at the Priest shelter.  As confessions are private, I can't go into detail about the trail sin to which I confessed except to assure everyone that no law was broken, no one was hurt, and that I did my very best to clean the handle of the privy shovel at that shelter back in the Smokies.  Stay tuned for www.everysheltershouldhaveaprivy.org.  Feeling much better after confessing my late night mishap, I began the arduous journey down the Priest.  Again, never assume the AT will let you have an easy day.  The descent trail is very steep and extremely rocky, the kind of trail that is most challenging for me.  The trail drops 3,093 feet over a course of 4.3 miles.  About half way down, I was treated to a magnificent view from a rock outcropping.  I paused and ate my lunch there, sitting under a tree to stay out of the bright, hot sun. I mentioned to Sweet Tea, a very nice thru hiker I met on the outcropping, that at least we didn't have to hike down the Priest in the rain.  He agreed, and I finished the descent without mishap, although I did slip several times on some loose rocks.  The AT then crosses the Tye River on another suspension bridge.  I met a pair of southbounders who asked me about trail conditions they would encounter hiking up the trail I had just finished descending.  I was giving them my honest appraisal when Sweet Tea happened by.  I asked him if he had anything to add.  He scratched his head and replied, ""Well, there is a lot of up.""I crossed the suspension bridge (they never get old) and began my final three miles of the day to Harpers Creek Shelter.  A few minutes into my final climb of the day, I began to here pattering amongst the leaves.  Within a few minutes, it begins to rain, hard.  I quickly took off my pack and added my pack cover.  I did not bother putting on my rain jacket since I was already sweat soaked from today's hike.  The thunder and lightening show began next as I continued on.  The storm certainly cooled things down and helped invigorate this hiker who was feeling pretty worn out prior to this unexpected change in weather.  So much for my plan of a leisurely stroll into camp this evening.  I got to the tent area at 5:00, set my tent up in the rain (keeping my equipment if not exactly dry, then at least only damp), and went for water at the creek in front of the shelter building.  The thunder and lightening, but not the rain, having ended by this time.  The rain did slow soon after, and by the time I was setting up my stove, had stopped altogether.  Gravity arrived about this time and was able to set up his camp in the not-rain.  Sometimes being last isn't a bad thing, although there was, of course, no way of knowing the rain would stop when it did.  On a positive note, the rain really cooled things off this evening and dispersed the gnats that had been my constant companions for much of the day.  My wet clothes are in my plastic bag ready to be worn tomorrow (if it's raining they are wet anyway, and if it's not, wearing them is the quickest way of drying them), my equipment is in fine shape (if a bit damp), and I am warm and cozy in my sleeping bag.  Tomorrow promises to be an easy day (but I won't jinx anything by mentioning it!), and Gravity and I plan on spending the afternoon, evening, and night at the Devil's Backbone Brewery. They provide free camping for hikers as well as serving lunch, dinner, and breakfast (breakfast is for hikers only). They also happen to be well known for their beer.  Time to go back to sleep and get rested up for another day of whatever the AT decides to come up with for me tomorrow.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter Tent Site

Note:  I was able to upload photos from 6/11 through 6/14 today.
Today was a special day both on and off the trail that leaves me full of joy and contentment  (although, admittedly, with sore feet).  Stopping at Devil's Backbone Brewery was always part of my plan, and today was the day.  From reading and you tube videos, I knew that the brewery was very hiker friendly, offering free camping, a wonderful restaurant, award-winning beers, a hiker breakfast, and a shuttle back to the trail.  I slept in a bit this morning, because it was ""only"" a 7.9 mile hike to Reeds Gap and VA  664, the road where the brewery is located.  I was on the trail by 7:30 and, after a minor bit of confusion about where the trail headed out (will I ever  learm?), I was ready to tackle Three Ridges Mountain. Or, rather, it was set to tackle me. I know there must have been tougher climbs, but I don't remember when.  There were numerous rock scrambles, some of them extremely steep, as well as lots of loose rocks strewn by the thousands on the trail.  Still, I was rewarded by several beautiful views, and I actually enjoyed the challenge of most of the ascent (with the exception, as always, of the loose-rocks-trying-to-twist-your-ankle part).  One cool thing about following the white blazes is that if you stick with it, you'll get through it.  In time, I reached the summit, and found that the descent was not nearly as rugged as the ascent, another example of Virginia's ""roller coaster"" mountains. Over the past few days, I have made some new trail friends.  U-Turn and Colonel are a daughter/father team that is thru hiking together.  I had the pleasure of talking with both of them today.  Colonel is convinced that all of Virginia seems to be ""up.""  Their relationship with each other is obviously special, and it is a joy to see them together.  Having hiked a section of the trail with my son, Stephen, and looking forward to doing the same in Vermont with my daughter, Becky, it makes me realize what a lucky father I am.  My son, Greg, lives in England, so he won't be hiking with me, but I know he is following along with my adventures and misadventures.  I also had a nice chat with Brooke today, who is combining a love of biology and walking by doing a thru hike.  He was fortunate enough to see a huge rattlesnake the other day and shared his video with me.  It took awhile, but I finally made it to Reeds Gap, and Gravity was soon there as well.  We faced the dilemma of how to travel the five miles from the Gap to the Brewery.  For the first time on the trip, I stuck out my thumb and hitch hiked.  In less than a minute, a car pulled over to give us a ride. A wonderfully friendly and outgoing man named Hurt was more than happy to take us to the Brewery.  I offered to buy him a beer, and he said he would probably be back at the pub that evening.  After good-naturely agreeing to a photo opp, he left us at our destination.  The next thought in my mind was as always now, food and how to get it. Gravity and I went into the restaurant, where I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, fries, and a Backpackin' Brown Ale.  All were first rate.  After eating, we headed over to the tentsite area.  Just in time, it turns out, because within minutes of setting up our tents and getting our gear situated, the now daily thunderstorm began.  Gravity stayed in his tent while I walked back to the Brewery in the rain.  As I was relaxing under the pavilion, I noticed that a staff meeting of some sort was going on.  As soon as it ended, I approached Tony to personally thank him for everything that Devil's Backbone was doing for us hikers.  We started up a spirited conversation about brewing beer, and he offered me my own personal tour of their brewing facility and threw in a complimentary pint as well. I found that all the Devil's Backbone employees I met today are like Tony; friendly, outgoing, and passionate about their products.  Elizabeth took a photo of Tony and me before explaining everything the brewery offered hikers, and then took a selfie with me.  Tony came back to escort me to my tour guide, Carrie.  She showed me their system at this facility, which is used for experimenting with recipes, while their main production occurs at their facility in Lexington. The system here is of German design but was actually manufactured and originally used in Japan.  The system had to be completely disassembled for shipping and, upon arrival, it was discovered that all of the instructions and control information were in Japanese. Their head brewer had quite a challenge figuring out which control did what, and the original Japanese lettering is still on the system (with English translations added above).  Carrie told me about the brewery's ""Family Beer"" program.  Once a year, all Devil's Backbone employees are involved in a meeting where they are randomly assigned to a team with one brewer per team and challenged to come up with a new beer.  The best of these collaboration beers are then produced for sale. Backpackin' Brown Ale, Apricot Jam, and Shroom Ale, are all such family beers.  Carrie's team came up with Apricot Jam and, while I am not usually a fan of fruit beers, I found it subtle and delicious.  After the tour, I sat at the bar to enjoy my free pint, and was soon joined by Hurt and his husband, Peter.  We had a wonderful conversation covering everything from beer, Virginia, education, and what is truly important in life. While discussing the difficulty of the trail over Three Ridges Mountain, I asked Peter if he had ever considered a thru hike.  He said he was still in the forty year training plan for his hike.  We had a great time and, again, I continue to be amazed and humbled by all of the tremendous people I am meeting.  After Hurt and Peter left, it was time to eat again. I went back to my old standard of a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  The food was again delicious.  Hiker midnight approached, and Gravity and I headed for our tents.  The hiker breakfast tomorrow is at 7:00 and the shuttle is at 10:00.  The plan is to go fourteen miles tommorow, which will then get us to Waynesboro early on Friday.  The trail appears to be reasonably easy, but only time will tell.  Mike, a good friend and hiking buddy from back home, will be in Waynesboro and I am excited about sharing this adventure with an old friend along with my new ones.","Harpers Creek Shelter Tent Site

I woke up at my regular time this morning but was in no hurry to pack up, since the shuttle back to the trail wasn't until10:00.  I was one of the first hikers to get to the cafe to order a hiker's breakfast. At one time, Devil's Backbone only provided breakfast for hikers, but now the cafe is open to all.  The hiker's breakfast consists of two eggs over easy, bacon, fried potatoes, a biscuit, and coffee.  That sounded great to me.  In fact, it was so great that the Hobbit in me came out, and I ended up ordering an entire ""second breakfast.""  Dakota, Melanie, and London (the chef) were all super friendly and graciously posed for a photo.  I also remet a very nice family in the cafe.  I had briefly met Paul, his daughter Melanie, and her son Kayler the evening before, and we struck up a good conversation this morning.  Paul filled me in on some of the history of Devil's Backbone Brewery, and we also discussed the local area and touched a bit on baseball (he was wearing a Nationals hat). Kayler had a Grover doll, and I told Melanie about the greatest Sesame Street book of all time, The Monster at the End of this Book.  It soon became time for me to pack up for the trail, and they posed for a quick photo before I excused myself.  Thanks, guys!  On my way out the door, I walked around Maple, who was getting ready to continue hiking with her human, Jason, by resting on the outside deck of the cafe.  Maple is a great trail dog who I also got to know yesterday.  Jason told me she was a rescue dog who was found as a puppy abandoned in a box in the snow. He told me her history, and I told him about our dog Roxie, who had been a breeder dog until the age of eight.  Roxie, a very special Yorkie, spent those first eight years of her life primarily in a cage, but then she lived another ten years with us.  She might not have been cut out to be a trail dog, but she was a special part of our family for a long time and we all loved her very much. I realized if I didn't get a move on I risked missing the shuttle, so I patted Maple one last time, and returned to the tent area and packed my gear. I made it in plenty of time.  The shuttle was a bit late, but we were all back on the trail by 10:45, still with plenty of time to cover the 14.1 miles that were the plan for the day.  Within a half mile, I encountered more trail magic.  According to the note written on the case of Coors Light sitting on the trail, a hiker named Nothin' Yet had experienced a very bad day on that spot and wanted other hikers to enjoy a beer.  They were still cold, and Gravity and I drank one right there, proving once and for all that we ain't no beer snobs.  Thanks, Nothin' Yet, for the beer.  I hope your days get better.  The trail today was a mixture of easy trail and rocks, although their were no big ascents or descents.  I did have another mishap and tripped over a rock, this time landing on my right knee and my hands.  Fortunately, I wasn't injured, and simply told off the rock (which didn't seem to phase it much) and continued on. I encountered some very impressive views and met two southbound hikers who told me of rattlesnakes ahead. Unfortunately, I didn't see one, although the open, sunny rocks were a perfect place for them.  I came across another piece of long forgotten history, as I hiked along a stone wall/fence for several miles.  Someone put a huge amount of work into that wall.  Too bad they didn't also use the rocks on the trail, which I'm assuming was a long abandoned road.  Although it was getting a bit late, I decided to take the side trail to visit The Rocks.  These massive rock structures jut out from the cliff side and hang out far over the valley below.  I scrambled to the top of the larger one to look around.  There was a couple on the smaller of the rocks who were in perfect position to take a great picture of me, but they were, shall we say, involved with each other so I didn't want to disturb them. Back on the trail, I came upon Gravity, who didn't take the side trail.  We hiked together for a few miles until we came to the Glass Hollow Overlook side trail.  Gravity decided not to go down the 0.2 mile trail, as he was concerned about the possibility of an upcoming thunderstorm.  I did go down to the overlook, which didn't actually provide much of a view.  What I did get a clear view of was the rapidly darkening sky. This old man really threw it into overdrive the last 1.8 miles to the campsite. It became very dark and the wind picked up as thunder rumbled in the distance.  I caught up with Gravity as we both motored on.  We made it to the tent site, got out tents set up and our packs inside, literally a minute before the rain began falling in earnest and the storm hit. The rain abated long enough for me to get water and hang my food bag from the bear pole (I didn't eat a cooked supper).  I set up inside my tent and went to bed. As I write this, it is absolutely pouring outside, but all is well inside the tent.  Tomorrow is a short five miles to Rockfish Gap and a shuttle ride into Waynesboro.  My friend, Mike, is already there waiting for me.  After several days of alternatively hiking in very warm, sunny weather and then the now daily thunderstorm, I have developed such an advanced case of ""hiker funk,"" that it is getting difficult for mr to stand myself. Tomorrow will be a ""nearo."" A short hike in, and then a one night stay at the Quality Inn to shower, do laundry, resupply food and a few other supplies, and eat a lot of food somewhere. We'll start hiking the Shenandoahs on Saturday morning.","Reeds Gap/Devil's Backbone Brewery

The rain stopped during the night, and I woke up at 6:10 and started getting ready for the day.  I was especially excited because Mike, my good friend and hiking buddy from home, was meeting me today to hike the Shenandoahs with me.  There were only five miles to hike, but I wanted to get an early start because we would have a big day in Waynesboro.  Gravity had already rented us a room at the Quality Inn, so we would have a base of operation.  As I was packing up, two other thru hikers, Splat and Dory, headed out a bit before me.  I had quickly said hi to them yesterday evening as we were all frantically trying to get tents set up before the storm hit.  I wished them happy hiking as they headed out.  I was on the trail by 7:45.  For the most part the trail was good, and I made good time.  I passed an old cemetary and stopped for awhile among the numerous flat rock headstones.  None of the headstones are marked in any way, so there is no way to ascertain the identities of the souls buried there.  I wondered about the lives, aspirations, frustrations, loves, and challenges of all those buried there.  These were as real to them in their time as ours are to us today.  But it is all lost to history. It made me think that the only truly important legacy we leave on planet Earth is the difference we make in the lives of others. Everything else we do will someday be forgotten.  But, like ripples in a pond, the effect we have on others survives in them to be passed on down to further generations.  I passed slowly among the graves and said a prayer for everyone interred there before continuing down the trail. I soon came across an old chimney and foundation of a long abandoned homestead. I wondered if the inhabitants were buried at the cemetary at the top of the hill.  A short distance past the foundation was a little stream where I stopped for water. This was one of a number of places I could have stopped, but it occurred to me how important this stream must have been to the people up the hill in the cabin.  I wondered how many countless trips had been made by the men, women, and children of this long lost community, toting buckets of water to fulfill their daily needs.  With more than enough water to reach Rockfish Gap, I hurried on. I met Mike at the road. It was great to see him, and I am really excited about hiking with him. We looked up the road and saw a woman unloading food out of her vehicle.  Trail Magic! Splat's mother was meeting her and Dory and was providing a second breakfast for all comers.  She had fresh fruit, yogurt, homemade cookies, cold drinks, and other goodies.  Second breakfast again!  It was here that I heard about the adventure Splat and Dory had this morning.  They came upon a mother bear and her cub while hiking the switchbacks on the way to Rockfish Gap.  The cub scampered up a tree, and the mother bear raised up on her hind legs, growling.  Splat and Dory backed up, but there was no way Mama Bear was leaving with Baby Bear still in the tree.  Thinking quickly, the young ladies hiked straight up the hill to the next leg of the switchback and circumvented the bears.  I think they can be forgiven if they bypassed a white blaze!  Of course, by the time I happened along, mother and baby were no where to be seen.  While we were finishing our delicious second breakfast, a gentleman in a yellow truck drove up and offered us a free shuttle to Waynesboro.  We hustled into his truck and were soon at the Quality Inn.  We had two hours to check-in, so we walked the few blocks to the laundromat.  I ended up wearing my rain coat and pants so all of my clothes could be washed.  I had to turn them inside out when I was able to change because they were soaked inside from sweat. I'm sure I looked as dignified as I felt in my rain clothes. I guess it's all part of hiking the AT. With clean clothes, we headed down the street to Wal-Mart to resupply. Our packs will be heavy tomorrow, since our next stop will be Front Royal on Friday. We then checked into the hotel and showered.  I spread my stuff out to dry.  I'm sure I helped the appearance of the hotel when I spread my tent over a bush outside to dry.  After we were cleaned up, we headed down the street for food.  We went to Jake's Bar and Grill and had a wonderful meal.  The restaurant is fantastic and prides itself in using locally sourced ingredients whenever possible.  Many of their brews are also from local breweries.  I wanted to go there after talking with a woman I met on the trail this morning.  The restaurant was started by the mother of Lance Corporal Jason, ""Jake,"" Redifer, who had longed dreamed of owning a restaurant.  When her son was killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan, Jake's mother established the restaurant in his honor.  What a wonderful tribute to her son.  While we were eating, the rain began.  It slackened somewhat, and we decided to walk the mile to Basic City Brewing Company.  We had gone about two blocks when the rain started to pour down.  As backpackers, all three of us are used to walking in the rain, and at least we wouldn't be setting up tents in it. Also, concrete doesn't turn to mud when it gets wet. We arrived at the brewery, where they were kind enough to give us towels. We sampled a few brews and then headed back to the hotel. We still needed to sort food, get the clothes we were wearing as dry as possible, and get things ready for tomorrow.  With all that accomplished, it was time for bed.  We plan on a short day tomorrow, so we don't need to feel rushed leaving Waynesboro.  There is a free continental breakfast, and I saw a waffle maker so I am ready.  It will be really fun hiking with Mike, and I am excited about reaching the Shenandoahs. Several southbounders have told me of all of the bears they saw while there (this morning, Angus told me she saw eight) so maybe my time will come.  If not, the purpose of this journey is not to see bears (although I am not altogether sure what the purpose is) so I know I'll have a great adventure no matter what.","Paul C.

I was up by 6:30 this morning and finished loading my pack before we headed to the breakfast area at the Quality Inn to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, biscuits, gravy, yogurt, fresh fruit, and cereal, in addition to waffles.  I washed my breakfast down with orange juice and coffee and then arranged a shuttle for Gravity, Mike, and I back to Rockfish Gap and the trailhead.  I am so excited about being able to hike with Mike again.   We were met at the trailhead with more trail magic.  A gentleman named Pat brought donuts and juice to the parking lot to share with hikers.  I had a chocolate covered donut which was delicious, even if I did have a time getting the chocolate out of my beard.  We then shouldered our packs, about ten pounds heavier than yesterday as we were loaded down with several days of food, and hit the trail. Right after beginning our hike, we reached Shenandoah National Park and registered at the kiosk.  It is free to hike in the park, although you have to fill out a registration tag that must be affixed to your pack.  As we had been warned, the trail was initially steep and quite rocky, but the trail soon changed to be much easier to travel.  There were still many steep sections, but the rocks diminishes appreciatively.  At McCormick Gap, we met Don, Kevin, and Brennan with the Potomoc Appalachian Trail Club.  These fine gentleman were preparing to clear underbrush from the trail up Bears Den Mountain.  Once again, with spirit, ""Thank you, Trail Maintainers!""  Kevin has a decal of a white blaze on his car, and Don's license plate proudly reads, ""TRLBLDR.""  We chatted for a bit before we headed up the mountain, which sports several communication towers near and at its summit.  We walked through chest high grass near the summit, knowing that, thanks to the efforts of those wonderful volunteers, this afternoon's hikers would enjoy a much easier path.  We met Don at the top of the mountain.  I learned that he was a Navy veteran who served for many years as a Scoutmaster.  Upon learning that I taught students with disabilities, he shared stories of how he had helped include students with disabilities in his scout troop.  After thanking him for his considerable contributions to our nation, Scouting, people with disabilities, and the AT, I hiked on.  The AT is full of interesting discoveries.  For instance, who would guess that the summit of Bears Den Mountain is adorned with numerous tractor seats imbedded in the ground?  Mike was almost thrown by one before we found a pair to relax in for a few minutes before heading northward to climb Little Calf and Big Calf Mountains.  At the top of Big Calf, Mike helped the mountain grow by adding a small stone to the top of a rock pile located at the summit.  There is a USGS marker denoting the location and elevation of the summit, but, thanks to the efforts of hikers, it is now inaccurate by several feet.  We reached our intended destination of Calf Mountain Shelter by 1:00.  Gravity, Mike, and I conferred and decided it was too early and the weather too conducive to stop for the day.  We knew that water was an issue, because there was a long stretch without a water source coming up soon. We ended up filling all our water bottles at a spring at Mile 870.2, plus we each added an additional liter to prepare for a dry camp.  We ate lunch by the spring, one because it was a pretty place and, two because it helped reduce our pack weights a bit, but with the addition of two extra pounds of water, they were heavy indeed as we hiked on.  At Turk Gap, I was able to meet Redeye's father.  As I've mentioned, Redeye is a joyful young woman whom I have encountered several times during the past few weeks.  She is a true free spirit and epitomizes what is good in ""hike your own hike.""  If there is a swimming hole to be found, rest assured that Redeye will find it. She hikes the trail with boundless enthusiasm and never fails to bring a smile to me when we see each other. Mike, her father, drive down from Quebec to spend some time with her, and they were together at the parking lot at Turks Gap when I got there. We had a great conversation, particularly about daughters, and I shared photos of Becky, who has recently taken up Aireal Silks.  She sends me photos of herself hanging gracefully upside down by silks suspended from a ceiling. Both Redeye's dad and I are rightfully quite proud of the women our daughters have become.  After wishing them well, Gravity, Mike, and I hiked a few more miles to an unnamed campsite alongside the trail at Mile 876.9. It is a dry camp, so we will definitely need our extra water, as we are about six miles to our next water source.  There was room for Gravity's and my tents, and Mike set up his lightweight tarp, under which he and I used to sleep many a night during Scout backpacking trips.  A sign a few miles back warned us of possible aggressive bear activity in the area, so we were sure to do a careful job hanging our food this evening.  Having almost doubled our intended mileage today, we plan to hike through Loft Mountain Campground tomorrow afternoon, enjoying lunch at their campground restaurant, and then hiking until we feel like stopping.  I will never be as free-spirited as Redeye, but I believe there are lessons to be learned about not being too regimented.  I doubt I'll ever grow too fond of swimming holes, though . . .","Rockfish Gap/Waynesboro, Virginia

I woke up this morning at 5:45 feeling rested.  I laid in bed until 6:00 and then got up and started to get ready.  Rain was forecast for the day, and we wanted to get as far as we could before having to deal with that.  Mike was already getting ready.  He told me he had slept well after he got everything squared away.  Sleeping under a tarp isn't for everyone, but it is a viable option.  With the advent of very light tents, tarping has lost a lot of popularity. In fact, Mike has the only tarp I have seen on the trail.  We left early, knowing we had almost six miles to travel before our next water source.  Mike and I each had a liter, while Gravity had a bit more than that. The hike to the foot of Blackrock Mountain went well, and we passed a few views on the way.  While the ascent up the mountain was steep, the trail remained good.  We reached Blackrock Hut in good shape, loaded up with water, and then completed the hike up Blackrock Mountain. One of the greatest things about the AT is that there are so many surprises along the way. Yesterday, the top of one mountain was covered with communication towers and tractor seats.  On another mountain, Mike added a small stone to a chest-high pile of rocks to add a half inch of elevation to its summit.  The top of Blackrock Mountain, on the other hand, consists of millions of huge loose boulders jumbled high above the trail. I left my pack and poles by the trail and scrambled up to the summit.  I'm guessing these massive boulders were deposited by a glacier eons ago.  Climbing to the top involved mapping out a path among the jumble of boulders, being careful not to slip into any number of deep crevices between them.  I paused at what I think was the summit to admire the view before beginning the scramble back down to the trail.  I've learned that coming down a rock and boulder field is always a trickier proposition than going up.  I purposely took a alternate route down just to mix things up a bit.  Back on the trail, it became obvious that the jumble of boulders continued far down the mountain as well.  It is an amazing sight and is a popular destination. Of course, people with cars can park a short distance from the summit and don't need to climb the entire mountain to encounter its summit.  The original plan for the day had been to stop at the Loft Mountain Campground, but our extended day yesterday put us near there too early in the day to stop. Besides, rain is forecast for tomorrow, so we wanted to get further today.  Thunderstorms were threatening today as well, but had dissipated by the time we approached the campground.  We passed by the campground but could not resist the call of the Loft Mountain Wayside Restaurant.  The trail to the restaurant is a few miles further north than the trail to the campground and also requires a very steep and rocky 0.3 mile side trail to reach it.  This provided no deterrence,  and the three of us worked our way down the Frazier Discovery Trail to the Wayside.  I enjoyed a caloric fix of a cheeseburger and fries washed down with a lemonade and a Gatorade, and topped off with a blackberry milk shake.  I saw  Brooke there, and we discussed trail diet and rattlesnake sightings.  He saw another one and shared the video. There was a squall of rain while we were there, but it didn't last long.  Then, there was nothing else but to struggle back up the side trail to the AT.  There were still nearly five miles to the Pinefield Hut (what are usually called shelters on the AT are called huts in the Shenandoahs), so we decided to try to find a stealth campsite like we had yesterday.  No such places presented themselves, so we arrived at the Pinefield Hut close to 8:30, after a long 18.9 mile day (which, of course, does not include the side trail mileage).  The tent area is located high above the shelter and it was already pretty much filled.  Splat and Dory were there, and it was great to see them again. Gravity found a tent spot there, but Mike and I opted to camp behind the shelter on a piece of mostly flat ground.  I've slept on far more slopey places. It is not designated for camping but there are no signs prohibiting it either. We set up camp by the light of our headlamps, hung our slightly lighter food bags on the bear pole, and went to bed. It was an eventful and challenging day.  I am finding myself feeling more worn out during the day, which I am attributing to the heat.  There is a 90 percent chance of rain tomorrow, so it looks like we will be hiking in liquid sunshine again.  At least that will help keep the temperature down.","Unnamed Campsite at Mile 876.9

I slept more soundly than usual last night, and my journal entry wasn't completed until 4:30.  I still woke up at 5:30 and was out of bed by 6:00.  Rain was very much in the forecast, but the sky was still mostly clear at 7:30, when I hit the trail.  Splat and Dory left a few minutes before me, and I joked that they were going to scare off my bear again.  They excitedly asked me to guess who else had seen a bear.  I guessed the names of several hikers that we both knew, but was unsuccessful.  Dory gave me the answer: Momma Splat.  She had seen a bear on the road from her car.  I am beginning to think I am a bear summoner.  I am doomed to never see a bear myself, but those I come in contact with do.  As excited as Momma Splat was to see a bear, I can be okay with this.  Congratulations, Momma Splat!  The weather was warm and muggy as Mike, Gravity, and I set off.  By the time I was half way up Weaver Mountain, I was already completely soaked in sweat.  I have taken to putting my phone in an extra Ziploc bag when carrying it in my pocket, since my pants get so wet from sweat.  Just past the top of Weaver, we came across a 900 written in sticks in the woods.  It is so hard to believe that I have come this far.  There are only about another 100 miles in Virginia, and half way is less than 200 miles away.  Just past the mileage marker, there was a beautiful view looking down into Powell Gap Hollow.  We paused there awhile to enjoy the view.  I took a photo of Mike wearing his red ball cap emblazoned with the number 38. One of Mike's reasons for wanting to hike the Shenandoahs is that he and his brother, Hal, hiked here 35 years ago.  Four years ago, while riding his bike in a race, Hal suffered a fatal heart attack.  Hal's racing number was 38.  The sky was still mostly clear when we left the overlook and headed for Hightop Hut to get water and eat lunch. Here we found Dory, Splat, and Redcap resting in the shelter.  A storm was forcast to begin soon, and they had decided to wait it out in the shelter.  Mike and I ate lunch and headed back out on the trail to meet Gravity, who we learned from a southbounder had just passed the shelter.  We caught up with him just before the Hightop Mountain overlook.  The clouds were rolling in as I took a photo of the view.  As I was leaving, Mike said to look back. The view was already gone, replaced by a foggy mist.  Gravity said he expected the rain to hit in about fifteen minutes.  He missed the mark by five minutes.  There is an old saying that I know I have mentioned before.  ""No rain, no pain, no Maine.""  I actually enjoy hiking in the rain.  As it began, I quickly attached my pack cover and put on my rain jacket. Due to the thunder and lightening, we all agreed to hike within sight of each other and continued our walk through a heavy downpour.  Gone was the lethargy I often feel when hiking in hot, muggy conditions, and I felt rejuvenated and recharged.  There is an excitement about a good storm, sort of like the thrill children get from jumping in puddles.  The heaviest rain abated in about fifteen minutes, although we would face a few more periods of heavier rains within the next few hours.  For the most part, we walked in a steady, cooling rain for about two and a half hours.  The rain had subsided when Mike suggested the 0.1 mile side trail to the South River Picnic Area to cook supper.  We enjoyed the use of picnic tables as well as a restroom that featured flush toilets, running water, and a soap dispenser. There were numerous posters instructing people on the proper methods of food care and storage while in bear country.  After dinner, we headed back down the trail a short distance to the South River Fire Road.  Guthook's AT Guide on Gravity's cell phone mentioned that there was a spot for ""twoish"" tents alongside the road.  It took a little imagination, but we were able to stretch ""twoish"" to ""threeish,"" and we ended up with a dandy little campsite along the road.  We made judicious use of an ""Ozarks hammer"" to drive in some of the stakes, but soon had the two tents and Mike's tarp set up.  We hung the food bags and were able to chat awhile before going to bed. Getting into camp at 6:30 provides several advantages over 8:30.  We covered 15.1 miles today and are in good shape to be in Front Royal by Friday, so Mike can head back home.  It is pleasanrly cool right now. The weather has cleared and there is little chance of rain until late Friday.  Hopefully, today's storm will help keep the temperature cooler, but you pretty much take what you get.  I'll enjoy tonight snuggled in my sleeping bag and see what tomorrow will bring.","Pinefield Hut Tent site area

Mike and Gravity did not visit the cabin, so I had fallen a ways behind them.  When I caught up, they told me that a fawn had just dashed across the path right in front of them and that they had heard a large animal moving in the woods.  They were not able to see it, but they were both pretty sure it was a bear.  We stopped at Lewis Mountain Campground for water and to dump our trash.  This campground has an interesting history of beginning as a blacks-only campground in the days of Jim Crow laws.  According to the informational sign, the food and entertainment were so exceptional that white people wanted to be able to come to the campground as well.  It was integrated in 1950, several years before other facilities of its kind.  From there, we climbed Bearfence Mountain.  I took the side trail to the rock overlook and was treated to a magnificent view.  I also saw Bones and his trail dog, Ross, as well as Van Gogh.  I hadn't seen them in weeks.  Ross was especially friendly, and I figure he remembered the Slim Jim he had dog-eyed me out of during that lunch all that time ago.  It was a bit like a reunion seeing them again.  I also saw Pippi and Redcap on the overlook.  They had both been at the shelter yesterday when I heard about Momma Splat seeing a bear.  My reputation as a Bear Summoner grew a bit more, because, as you might have guessed, Redcap, who had passed near the Pocosin Cabin just a short while after we did, had seen a bear on the trail.  I'll bet he saw the one that spooked the fawn earlier.  Pippi, who, like me, has yet to see a bear, asked me to summon one for her. I told her that I will do my best.  After admiring the view and taking some photos, it was back to the trail.  Mike, Gravity, and I all ate lunch at Bootens Gap, prior to climbing Hazeltop Mountain. We made good time up and over Hazelton and then hiked the short side trail to Big Meadows Wayside.  Calorie time!  I guess it will surprise no one to find out that I ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a blackberry milkshake.  I also added a Gatorade and an orange juice.  We joined Splat, Dory, Pippi, Recap, and Mechanic at the picnic area.  Speedy and Young Buck were crashed out napping.  Bones and Van Gogh, with help from Ross, were performing on the lawn with Bones jamming on his guitar and Van Gogh on his harmonica.  I lay in the grass taking in the music on my right and the good-natured teasing and conversation of my hiking friends on my left and felt nothing but quiet contentment.   However, there was still four and a half more miles to go, so before too long it was back to the pack and the AT.  The trail runs right along the Big Meadows campground, and I met some special people along the way.  Billy and George from Ohio were only too happy to show off their 1960s Starcraft Pop-Up trailer, which is in excellent condition.  It is very similar to the one we camped in when I was a kid back in the '60s. Those were special times when Mom and Dad would take all nine of us kids camping for two weeks every summer.  And, no, we didn't all fit in the Starcraft, but it was a major part of the operation.  We had such good times.  I thanked Billy and George for triggering my walk down a very happy memory lane, and hit the trail again.  It was getting late, and we wanted to reach Rock Spring before dark.  I had walked about 100 yards, when a voice from above me in the campground shouted, ""Hey there.  Are you a thru-hiker?""  I replied that I was.  ""Would you like a sandwich and a cold drink?"" Like there was ever a question. I hurried up the path and met Riley and Lydia, also from Ohio.  Riley (his trail name is Smokey) thru hiked in 2014. He and Lydia had purposely camped right along the AT so they could provide trail magic to hikers.  I enjoyed a delicious ham and cheese sandwich and an ice cold Gatorade.  Mike and Gravity joined us, and we had a short chat about thru hiking. Again, the kindness and generosity of the AT community overwhelms me.  Thanks again, Smokey and Lydia!  We then actually started hiking with some speed attached as it was getting late.  We passed yet another spectacular view not far from the campground, made even more dramatic by the sun being low in the sky.  There were more beautiful vistas as we hiked along the Franklin Cliffs.  As I began to walk out on the last outcropping, I was met by two very excited young women.  They gestured to me to hurry.  ""We just saw a bear! A mother and two cubs!""  Of course, by the time I got there the bears had moved on and were no longer in sight.  The young women showed me were they had seen them.  It was wonderful to see them so excited.  All in a day's work for the Bear Summoner.  And while I might not have seen a bear, I did see several deer, an oriole, and a flock of seven wild turkeys.  Mike, Gravity, and I made it to the tent area of Rock Spring Hut as the sun was setting.  As I set up my tent, I listened to the good cheer of a group of Girl Scouts who had rented the cabin below the hut.  They were singing songs I remember from Girl Scout Day Camp when Becky was young. There weren't too many dads who volunteered for day camp, but I always enjoyed it.  One of my favorite photos of Becky and me was taking on our way to Me and My Guy at Camp Finbrook.  Becky was so excited wearing my old canvas Boy Scout backpack.  Pretty soon, she will be bringing her Osprey pack (with the little whistle on the chest strap) to hike with me in Vermont.  There was no reason to cook dinner (thanks again, Smokey and Lydia!), so I quickly finished my outdoor chores by the light of my headlamp, got myself ready for bed, and was in my sleeping bag before 10:00.  Tomorrow should be another fifteen plus mile day so it's time to get rested up for it.  It's another cool night, which makes for good sleeping.  I had actually expected today to be a pretty uneventful day, but I have very few of those on this trail. We'll see what tomorrow brings.","Unnamed tent site alongside South River Fire Road at Mile 910.9

Happy Summer Solstice! Today, June 21st, is also Hike Naked Day on the AT.  I can happily report that I saw no one hiking naked, although I did pass two young men in their skivies who appeared to be working up the nerve to participate in the tradition.  The plan for today was to hike to Pass Mountain Hut, a distance of 15.3 miles.  I woke up at the usual time and had camp broken down and was ready to go by 7:45.  I stopped by the cabin below to introduce myself to what I had been told was a Girl Scout troop.  It was actually a church group made up of largely young women and their leaders.  They asked me several questions about thru hiking while I was on my way to filter water.  I wished them luck as they prepared to complete the final ten miles of their thirty mile trek. Gravity, Mike, and I hiked out at 8:00.  The weather was clear and not too warm.  The trail soon turned rocky around Hawksbill Mountain, and there was one section that was made up of millions of small boulders that loomed far over head. A sign warned that climbing on the rocks was prohibited, which seems like a sensible precaution.  Hiking past this section required navigating over many small boulders of various sizes, a skill we would be called on to practice quite a bit today.  The reward was numerous outstanding views, including views early in the day from Crescent Rock Overlook and from several unnamed outcroppings.  We bypassed the Skyland Resort and Restaurant, although we did hike by the Skyland stables.  There I met Jeremy, who works with the horses and is the ranch hand who helps prepare visitors for horseback rides through the park.  While horses are banned from the AT, there are many trails in the Shenandoahs for equestrian pursuits.  I asked Jerimy about mules, and he told me the stables didn't have any but that he had been fighting for six years to get management to change their minds and get a herd of mules.  I encouraged him to keep up the good fight. I continued down the trail, which again soon became too steep and rocky for anything but foot travel anyway.  Mike and I soon arrived at the trail to Stony Man Summit, the highest point on the AT in Shenandoah National Park.  For about half a mile, the AT shares the trail with the Stony Man Summit Trail, and we walked along with many day hikers who quite obviously smelled of soap, shampoo, and deoderant.  After five hot days on the trail, I'm afraid we smelled a wee bit different.  We dropped our packs to hike the 0.3 mile side trail to a spectacular view from the summit. With Mike's help, I set a bit of Beau free into the wind at the very summit. After an interesting conversation with some day hikers from Maryland (I will be there soon!), we headed back to the AT.  We soon passed along the Little Stony Man Cliffs, which provided numerous opportunities for more breathtaking views. Mike told me that it had rained every day that he and Hal hiked thirty-five years ago, so he is now getting the opportunity to see what they missed back then.  We passed a large puddle at the top of one cliff without much thought.  Later, I was told by a day hiker with a very expensive camera that the scene from the cliffs, including that puddle, is immortalized on the back of the Virginia National Parks quarter. I'll need to check that out.  After a very rocky descent from the cliffs, we were again hiking adjacent to Skyland Drive. The trail parallels this road through much of the park and crosses it many times.  I decided to walk up the side trail to the road to the Stony Man Overlook so I could look back on where I had just been.  Mike opted to forgo this and continued down the AT.  Gravity arrived while I was admiring the view.After we departed, I decided to catch up with Mike, as Gravity was listening to a podcast from Beginning Brewing Radio.  I caught up with him at the Pinnacles Picnic Area, where we had decided to eat lunch.  About ten minutes later, Gravity arrived and proudly showed me the photo he had just taken of one of the two bears that had crossed the trail in front of him a few minutes before.  I practiced my now familiar refrain: ""I'm glad for you, and I hope to see one, too.""  He got a clear photo of the bear looking at him before heading back into the woods.   After sharing in his excitemnt and finishing my lunch, Mike and I headed on, after confirming with Gravity that we would meet at the Pass Mountain Hut to camp.  Areas to stealth camp are very rare in the Shenandoahs due to the terrain, and the park has worked hard to carve out adequate tent sites in the area around each hut.  Mike and I hiked up the Pinnacle and, after some more very challenging rock hopping/hiking, we arrived at Mary's Rock.  From the trail side, Mary's Rock is very impressive, and I struggled to find a suitable location to take a photo. Then, we dropped our packs for the side trail to the front of Mary's Rock.  Mary is the proud owner of one of the most massive rocks that I have ever seen. It rises far into the air above the surrounding mountain.  I scrambled to close to the top and posed for a photo.  The view, as with all of them today, was grand.  Back on the AT, we encountered nearly two miles of extremely rocky descent down to Thorton Gap. Thankfully, the last mile to the Hut was better, and we were fueled by trail magic of a bag of apples and bananas tied to a gate by the road. Mike and I set up our tents on two of the three relatively flat areas carved out for tents south of the hut.  Soon, two southbound section hikers from Philadelphia, Mike and Adam, joined us. Being hammock campers, they graciously agreed to set up their hammocks away from the last available tent spot.  I own a camping hammock and enjoy using it, and I was able to examine Mike's and Adam's hammocks to see what improvements are coming down in hammock design.  Fortunately, Gravity arrived in time to claim the last tent spot.  Sleeping areas in the shelters and tent spots are supposed to be on a strict first-come, firat-served basis, and attempting to ""save"" a spot is not considered good trail etiquette. Gravity had big news to share.  He had seen Pippi, who arrived at the picnic area minutes after Mike and I left. She asked Gravity to thank me because soon after our conversation yesterday, she saw a mother bear and two cubs.  My reputation as a Bear Summoner continues to grow. Instead of heading for the picnic table by the shelter, the three of us decided to simply share our own company, and we cooked our dinners sitting on some rocks on front of Mike's tarp. We have just two more days in the Shenandoahs before we reach Front Royal and will need to say goodbye to Mike. As always, it seems, time flies by.","Rock Spring Hut Tent Site

Today was pretty much a hike to get us closer to Front Royal tomorrow.  The plan had been to get as close to Front Royal as reasonably possible, but checking AWOL's Guidebook, Guthook's app, and, most significantly, reports from southbounders, there is little suitable ground for camping between Gravel Springs Hut and anywhere we could hope to get in a day.  So we decided to keep today short, refuel with the obligatory cheeseburgers and milkshakes at the Elkwallow Wayside, and get into camp early.  We can then get to bed early, so we can get an early start tomorrow for the final 13.4 miles to Front Royal.  The trail proved conducive to our plans today, and Mike and I arrived at the Wayside around 11:00.  I managed to remain stoic when I received the devastating news that the milkshake machine was broken.  With a stiff upper lip, I had a root beer float with my cheeseburger and fries.  With short mileage today, we stayed at Elkwallow for an hour and a half surrounded by a large number of bees.  Some people seemed rather unnerved, but the bees seemed far more interested in buzzing around than in getting serous enough to actually sting anyone.  I took a nice nap on a picnic bench and remained unscathed.  There were a few nice views today, particularly the one from Hogback Overlook, but none with side trails.  It was exciting to see Dory and Splat again today.  Momma and Daddy Splat are back, and I hear they provided more incredible trail magic for those lucky enough to be in their vicinity.  Unfortunately, I wasn't at the right place at the right time today.  We saw Dory and Splat as they slackpacked southbound after being dropped off by Parents Splat.  This pair of young women are best buds and radiate a joyful spirit to all around them.  They told me that Pippi told them about the ""bear blessing"" I bestowed upon her at Bearfence Mountain, and that they were actually with her when she saw the mother bear and her two cubs.  I hope to see Pippi again so I can share in her excitement. After parting ways with Splat and Dory, the trail remained good, and we arrived at Gravel Springs Hut by 3:30.  This proved very meaningful for Mike, because he recognized it as the same hut that he and Hal stayed in thirty-five years ago.  We were soon joined by Gravity. We set up camp and ate an early supper. The plan remains to get up early and make as good a time as possible to Front Royal.  It is always good to get to a resupply spot as early in the day as possible, but this takes on added significance tomorrow.  Rain is in the forecast, and apparently a big storm is brewing and headed our way.  It would be great if we could be settled in Front Royal before the worst of it hits. It's been fun hiking with Mike, and I'm happy for him that he got to re-experience the trail he hiked with his brother in his youth.  He'll head for home on Saturday, and, unless the weather is too terrible, Gravity and I will head for Harper's Ferry, Virginia, the home of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the emotional half-way point on the trail.  ETA: Tuesday, June 27th.","Pass Mountain Hut Tent Site

Note:  I am in Front Royal and was able to post numerous photos from 6/17 to 6/22 today.
We were all moving by 5:30 this morning because we knew we had a good distance to cover to get to Front Royal, and we wanted as much time as possible to complete our business in town. It had rained around four o'clock, but it had stopped by the time I got up. I was momentarily delayed when I discovered a surprise visitor on one of my socks, which I hang from the loops of my trekking poles every nught.  A large slug had made himself at home on my sock.  I was able to safely dislodge him and return him to the ground outside.  We were on the trail by 6:40 and made excellent time up Marshall Mountain.  The climb wasn't all that steep, and, with a few rocky exceptions, was good, smooth trail.  We passed one last overlook, and I took Mike's photo there.  It was while climbing Compton Peak that I met my first rattlesnake on the trail.  I actually saw her sunning herself on a rock before I heard her.  She was not pleased with my intrusion and made this fact quite clear by facing me and noisily rattling her tail.  I talked soothingly to her while I got out my phone to take pictures, but she wasn't impressed.  I carefully walked along the rocks and brush to the left side of the trail and got around her. Just then, Mechanic came up the trail, and I warned him about our unexpected companion. He was starting to follow my example,  when the snake crawled across the trail to take up residence where I had just walked. Mechanic was able to make his way past the brush on the right side of the trail, and we both continued on, leaving the snake behind.  I have always loved snakes, and it was quite exciting to encounter this one.  At Compton Gap, Mike was able to contact our shuttle driver, Sharon, and we got a piece of unexpected news.  She needed us at the shuttle point by 1:00, not at 2:00, as we had originally planned.  This left us one hour less to travel the 5.6 remaining miles to US 522.  All of our old legs were churning for the next two hours, but everyone made it before the deadline.  As Gravity chugged into the parking lot at 12:57, I made like a baseball umpire and called him ""safe.""  A few miles before the intersection, we passed out of Shenandoah National Park.  Sharon arrived a little after 1:00 and graciously took us back to Mike's car.  From there it was to the hotel for eagerly awaited showers and laundry.  We then headed for Wal-Mart to resupply for the four day journey to Harper's Ferry.  We then made for the Backroom Brewery, a place that Mike visited prior to joining us last week.  It is an amazing small brewery with 15 different beers on tap, all brewed on site using their three barrel system.  Chris, one of the employees, gave us a tour of the brewery and answered all of our questions.  We sampled several of their offerings while we feasted on pulled pork sandwiches and bratwurst.  I suppose no brewery is complete without a mannequin sporting a flower pot for a head, so I had to ask Chris about this particular addition to their lawn decor.  He told us of the day he arrived at work to find that a black bear had pushed out one of the windows of a storage shed, dined on an entire bag of grain, and fallen asleep in the building.  The bear was still there when Chris entered the building the next day. The mannequin serves as a deterrent to bears, a sort of a Scare Bear.  He added that another mannequin stands guard against deer at their garden site.  ""But why the flower pot for a head?"" I asked.  Apparently, some ne'er-do-well stole the head several months prior to our visit, and they had improvised as well as could be done.  It seems that mannequins, and their heads, are rather pricey.  After this wonderful visit to a great brew pub, it was back to the hotel to sort food, pack equipment, and get to bed. Mike will drop Gravity and me off at the trail head tomorrow morning before heading home to Rolla. It has been great fun sharing the Shenandoahs with him.  Gravity and I will begin our four day hike out of Virginia and on to Harper's Ferry.","Gravel Springs Hut Tent Site

I slept well in the hotel bed and was up by 5:30. It may have rained during the night, but the day dawned clear and cool, although quite humid. Mike had a long drive ahead of him back to Missouri, and Gravity and I needed to get back on the trail.  We left the hotel, grabbed take out at McDoinalds (I ordered two Egg McMuffins), and arrived at the trail at 7:15. We bid farewell to Mike and were back on the trail.  The plan is to reach Harper's Ferry by Tuesday, which should be no problem, as there are only  fifty-four miles separating Front Royal and Harper's Ferry.  Today's goal was Dicks Dome Shelter, 15.2 miles away.  I was in no hurry, because there would be no problem getting there in plenty of time before dark.  Unlike yesterday's hike, when there was a deadline that needed to be met, we would be camping in the woods tonight, so no such deadline existed.  I purposefully set out at a leisurely pace. The morning's trail was easy.  There is always a climb out of.town, but today's was not very steep, and the trail was mostly free of rocks and other obstructions. There is a different beauty to clear trail in the woods, and a beauty that is far easier on the feet. About five miles into the hike, I arrived at the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter.  I stopped for water at the spring and met Toboggan (named for the hat not the sled). Toboggan is another good example of someone hiking his own hike.  He puts in long days of up to thirty or more miles for up to a week or two, but then goes home to Asheville for a week-long break before returning to the trail for another round of high-mileage days.  He asked if he could see the picture I took of him, because he is concerned about his weight loss while hiking, despite eating over 5,000 calories per day. He is certainly burning the calories. I wished him well as he prepared to jet down the trail on another high mileage day, content with the fact that I would be covering only half of his mileage today.  I was intrigued by the description of the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter in my guidebook, which adds a notation of a porch, chairs, and a solar shower to the usual list of privies, tenting, and water.  The. Denton Shelter is the mansion of shelters. There is a separate pavilion with a picnic table and fire ring. There is a porch with a bench and chaiirs.  I checked out the solar, spring-fed shower, but felt no need to try it out. This shelter even has a place to play horseshoes. I did visit the privy, which includes a two section door so you can open the top section for a view, an option that I did not choose to pursue. A few miles past the shelter, I came across an informational sign attached to a tree informing me that for the next twenty-seven miles I would be walking along the western boundary of Mosby's Confederacy, the base of operations for the partisan ranger, Colonel John Mosby, during the Civil War.  I was hiking through rugged terrain, and it was easy to see how Mosby's raiders could attack Federal troops and then seemingly melt away.  I was almost immediately brought back to the present, however, when the trail crossed VA 55, skirted a residential area, and crossed under I-66, a busy interstate highway.  The trail then crossed a stream over a footbridge that featured stone steps and truss-rod suspension.  There was a picnic table there, and I knew there would soon be a long climb out of Manassas Gap, so I decided to eat lunch there and was joined by Gravity.  I took a brief nap on the bench after eating, a nice luxery.  The trail up the mountain was steep and rocky in places, but, again, I took my time. I saw numerous piles of bear scat, but no bears. I passed a stone wall about halfway up and paused to wonder if it was involved in the fighting during the Civil War.  There isn't anyway to tell its age. As always, I am amazed at the amount of work that went into constructing these walls. Even with taking my time today, I reached Dicks Dome Shelter at 4:45.  Actually, the dome shelter, which is small and cramped, is no longer in use.  There is now a brand new shelter, which I believe will be renamed Whiskey Hollow Shelter.  I set my tent up along an old forest service road behind the shelter.  Gravity joined me about a half hour later.  We again opted to cook by our tents, as the shelter was inhabited by a group of loud weekend hikers. I was in bed before dark. The hike on tap for tomorrow will again be relatively short, and includes two features of note.  I will be hiking along the first half of the Roller Coaster, a 13.5 mile section of tightly packed ascents and descents, and I should also pass the 1,000 mile mark.  I am really excited about that and about reaching Harper's Ferry soon.  It's hard to believe I am almost halfway through this little adventure.","US 522/Front Royal, Virginia

I seemed excessively tired last night and slept heavier than usual. I even had an unpleasant dream but don't remember it. I woke up at 5:30, realized there was no big hurry today, and went back to sleep until 6:30.  A rare occurrence for this early riser. We didn't get on the trail until 8:30. Like yesterday, the goal was a bit over fifteen miles, with no deadline to get into camp.  The morning hike was uneventful.  I thought there might be views hiking through Sky Meadows State Park,  but the trail consisted mostly of well trimmed brush and some woods.  It was a pleasant walk, and I did see a doe on the trail.  She observed me for a moment as I came into sight around a curve before bounding into a thicket and immediately disappearing from my sight. While in the park, I met Helena and Art, two very friendly people from the area.  They are avid hikers, bikers, and homebrewers. We had a lively discussion about hiking in general as well as long distance hiking.  They enjoy going to Europe and hiking hotel to hotel or pub to pub.  My family and I have discussed doing this someday during a visit to see my son and his family, but we will want to wait until little Rose is old enough to remember the excursion.  Helena and Art filled me in a bit about the upcoming Roller Coaster, and enthusiastically recommended that we stop at the Bears Den Hostel, located near the end of the Roller Coaster, for lunch and ice cream. Based on their recommendation, Gravity and I will make a side trip there tomorrow.  I had a great visit with two very active and personable people.  Thanks!  I enjoy taking side trails to see interesting sights, so I decided to diverge from the AT to go see the Myron Glaser Cabin. After a steep 0.2 mile walk, I came upon the cabin to find it rented out to a family with a loud, although probably friendly, dog.  I took a.quick photo and departed.  Gravity caught up with me near the Rod Hollow Shelter, and we ate lunch prior to entering the Roller Coaster.  There is a sign on a tree as you enter the Roller Coaster, and some  jester added the caveat that you must be so tall to ride.  Fortunately, I made the grade. The Roller Coaster is indeed challenging, consisting of a series of seven very steep ascents and descents.  It's a fun concept and makes for some difficult hiking, and it is definitely a challenging and rewarding experience to ""ride"" the Roller Coaster.  Several miles into the Roller Coaster, I came across a very significant sign made of sticks alongside the trail: 1,000 miles.  There is a song whose lyrics go something like, ""I have walked 500 miles and I will walk 500 more."" Well, I have now done that and find myself close to halfway done with my thru hike adventure.  It has been a phenomenal experience so far, and I see no reason why it won't continue to be so as I continue.  Helena and Art asked me what was my favorite part of the trail, and I told them it is all of the wonderful people I continue to meet, both on and off the trail. As I near the halfway point, I can look back on the fun times I have already had  and look forward to new adventures in the future.  For now, it's time to sleep. The rest of the Roller Coaster, as well as Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream at the Bears Den, await me tomorrow.","Dicks Dome Shelter Tent Site

I was up early this morning because, even though it was to be a relatively short mileage day, there were two places I wanted to visit.  Also, the first half of the day would still be on the Roller Coaster, so I expected some tough going.  Gravity and I were on the trail by 7:45 and made reasonable time considering the three miles to Bears Den Hostel consisted of three hills on the Roller Coaster.   Bears Den was built in 1933 by local stonemasons for a wealthy Washington physician. It was styled after medieval European castles.  After the death of the physician and his wife, the home was vacant for twenty years before being purchased in 1984 by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club, who later sold it to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  It opened as a hiker hostel in 1989.  It is a fascinating structure and features hostel bunks, a campground, and a rustic cottage.  They also sell ice cream.  I purchased a pint of Caramel Apple Pie ice cream and ate it at a picnic table shaded by a pavilion. I washed it down with a root beer.  Bears Den is a wonderful place, and I'm glad I stopped to visit even if I didn't stay there.  I then ""rode"" the Roller Coaster down the hill to Snickers Gap, which is on VA Highway 7.  While the AT is usually content to stay in the woods, there are times when it follows and crosses major roads.  We hiked along the shoulder of this four-lane highway for about a quarter mile and then crossed it at Pine Grove Road. There was a blind curve close to the crossing and care was definitely required.  I ended up running across, although the oncoming cars weren't really all that close.  It was then back into the woods to continue on the Coaster.  The hike consisted of working over and around countless rocks, and Gravity took a photo of me on one section.  You can tell it is the trail by the white blaze painted on a rock under my foot.  This was a relatively flat transition section between hills, so we decided to stop by a fallen log to eat lunch.  It was here that I met Chuck Squared, as I call them.  Chuck and Chuck (they share the same trail name) are a wonderful couple from Georgia who hike a section of the AT every sunmer.  This year they hiked from the James River and will finish their section tomorrow in Harper's Ferry.  I am so glad that I asked them about their unique trail names.  The Chucks told me it is a term of endearment taken from Macbeth (""My dearest Chuck"").  The term is also used in Wuthering Heights, and, of course, it is a term of endearment that Peppermint Patty uses for Charlie Brown. It turns out that both Chucks are high school Literature teachers. We hiked together for awhile and shared examples of our favorite books and ways to help today's students relate to classic literature.  I am so happy I got to meet them and wish them all the best in both their careers and in eventually completing their section hike of the entire AT.  After lunch it was up another very rocky hill, and, at Mile 1,006.3, I passed into West Virginia. The AT crisscrosses between the Virginias for a few miles, and I won't be permanently in West Virginia until tomorrow, but it was a strange feeling to be in a new state after several weeks and 550 miles in Virginia.  I enjoyed Virginia and never suffered from the dreaded ""Virginia Blues,"" but it is exciting to be in a new state.  I set a bit of Beau free in our new state and continued up the hill to Crescent Rock. My first impression of West Virginia was that their rocks weren't much different than Virginia ones.  There was a gorgeous view from Crescent Rock as the weather was again perfect for hiking today. I paused for awhile to enjoy the view and chat with several day hikers. It was here that I met another type of Trail Angel.  Miss America is a two-time thru hiker who is working this summer as a Ridgerunner.  Supported by both the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club,  her job is to hike the trails, offering assistance and guidance to hikers.  Miss America, who hiked in 2014 and 2015, is obviously passionate about the trail, and we had a tremendous conversation about thru hiking, Ridgerunning, and the joys and challenges of both.  As one of the challenges, I helped her pick up little shards of glass left from a broken bottle that someone thoughtlessly brought and left at Crescent Rock.  As I've mentioned before, anyone who would like to support the work of Miss America and the other Ridgerunners as they help protect and enrich the AT community, please consider supporting the ATC.  They, along with the volunteer hiking clubs like the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club,  are what keep the AT alive and well.  After bidding farewell to Miss America, I descended the last hill and completed the Roller Coaster.  The hiking became somewhat easier, and I made my way to the side trail leading to the Blackburn AT Center.  This is another beautiful building owned by the PATC and managed by Cheryl and Tim. Also built by a wealthy physician, the Blackburn now offers hostel services and camping for hikers. I enjoyed a glass of sweet tea, a soda, and some fresh cantaloupe, which was so delicious.  I had a chat with Cheryl, and she told me about the facilities and about her art.  I had a great visit, but it was starting to get late in the day, and there were still 3.2 miles to go to our planned campsite. The last few miles today were a mix of easy and very rocky trail.  I saw eight deer, but none were interested in photo opportunities. Near the end of the day, I passed a rock overlook and got a neat photo as the sun was beginning to get low in the sky.  I arrived at the camping area at the David Lesser Memorial Shelter at 7:30, and Gravity showed up a few minutes later.  We had a long, rugged walk down to the spring for water, and it was after dark by the time all the camp chores were done.  We are only 6.9 miles from Harper's Ferry and plan on getting an early start in the morning to get there before noon.  I hope to get a place at the hiker hostel at the Town's Inn, which is located in ""Lower Town."" I'll visit the ATC headquarters tomorrow and get my picture taken and placed in the thru hiker registry.  Gravity's wife, Kim, will meet us there.  We'll take care of resupply tomorrow, and I plan on taking a zero on Wednesday so I can spend all day being a tourist in historic Harper's Ferry.  We'll hike into Maryland and beyond on Thursday.","Sam Moore Shelter Tent Site

Note: I recently uploaded photos from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry.
I was up at 5:00 this morning, because we wanted to get into Harpers Ferry as soon as possible. We had 9.3 miles to go and hoped for good trail.  On that score, we were sorely disappointed (pun intended).  Much of the trail today was very rocky and hard to traverse. We persevered, although I did trip and fall once. Fortunately, I was able to twist to the side so I landed on my left elbow and hip and was unscathed.  Like before, it was in an area with fewer rocks, and I missed seeing the one that caught me. The trail remained challenging after we passed into Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.  In fact, it was still difficult after crossing the Shenandoah River via the US 340 bridge.  I saw a doe on the trail past the bridge, just a few hundred yards from the side trail to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy building.  There were numerous piles of bear scat on the trail to within less than a half mile of the river.  The raspberries are ripening, and the bears are eating their share. I even detected a musky odor in the air around a fresh pile of scat, but no sightings.  I mentioned to Gravity that with trail conditions as rough and rocky as they were, if you spent time looking for a bear, you would soon be looking for an ambulance, as attention needed to be given to every step.  There is exciting news about another bear sighting, however. While at Dick's Dome/Whiskey Hollow Gap, I discussed bears with some fellow hikers and explained about my possible role as a Bear Summoner. I asked them to let me know if they saw a bear, and, sure enough, I received a reply from Cathy in my guest book that they had indeed seen a bear after talking with me.  Coincidence? One can never be sure. Thank you, Cathy from Boston for getting back with me and letting me know!  Back to the trail, Gravity and I took the side trail to the ATC and made it there before noon.  Kim had just arrived.  It was quite an experience getting my official photo taken in front of the ATC building and placing it in the registry book.  My Harpers Ferry number is 1175.  My number at the beginning of my hike was 1621, so I guess I am moving up in the world. I spent some time at ATC looking at the exhibits and letting the reality that I had gotten this far soak in.  While at the center, I saw Chris, who I have known now for over a month. We frequently camp at the same place or he passes me along the trail.  Chris is a very knowledgeable backpacker and outdoorsman and is chronicling his AT journey on his YouTube channel, ""Chris Goes Outdoors."" Chris is an accomplished videographer, as well as a really nice guy, and his channel is well worth a look.  I have also decided that the ATC center also now holds the honor of nicest privy.  In a cute touch, there is a blue blaze and privy sign pointing to the restroom.  After signing the registry, Gravity and Kim drove me to the Town's Inn, located in the heart of Lower Town.  I was able to reserve a room in the hostel. The Town's End is owned and operated by Karen, who is delightful and very helpful in getting things arranged so I could stay.  She got a phone call before I could register, so she gave me the key on a handshake that I would return, so that Gravity and Kim (who, by necessity, were circling the block) would not have to wait.  We then drove to Wal-Mart to resupply for the three days it will take to get to Waynesboro, PA.  After eating lunch at an A&W/Long John Silvers, Gravity and Kim dropped me back off at the hostel. I have a quaint room that I am sharing with Mechanic. I unpacked, showered, and left my clothes to be laundered before heading into town to explore a bit.  I also made it to the Post Office (thanks to a very kind gentleman in a Ford Ranger even older than mine) who offered me a lift.  I picked up a care package sent to me from Beau's parents, Sue and Kim. There were goodies of all kinds; you could tell they have an excellent grasp on what a long distance hiker might want in a care package.  The snacks are already almost gone, and Mechanic and I toasted the trail and trail angels like Sue and Kim with the Single Malt Scotch and Fireball.  Thank you, Trail Angels from Providence!  Mechanic and I also shared dinner at the Coach House Grill and Bar across the street from the hostel.  The food and service were first rate, as I continued to make up any calorie deficit from the trail.  After dinner, I spent a quiet hour sitting on the porch, enjoying the breeze, watching the people, and uploading photos for my journal.  Hiker midnight still called at 9:30, and I slept a few hours before awakening to write this.  I am very excited about my zero day tomorrow.  I plan on rising early, eating breakfast at the cafe upstairs, and spending the rest of the day exploring the history of Harpers Ferry.
Note: Colleen, a dear friend from the Evanston days of my youth, recently asked me about my diet on the trail. I thought I would write a bit about what it takes to feed your body while asking it to put forth the effort that a thru hike over rigorous terrain requires.  First, a disclaimer.  This is what I have found to work so far, and my food decisions continue to develop. Everyone is different.  I have met many vegetarians and a few vegans who are doing just fine.  The challenge, of course, is balancing caloric needs with food weight, since food is the single heaviest item in your pack.  The longest I have gone between resupply is six days. At around two pounds of food per day, that makes for a heavy load.  I have lost twenty pounds from my body since I started,  but I purposely started fifteen pounds heavier than the weight I like to be when I am training for a marathon.  I started at 185 and now weigh 165 pounds.  I have lost several inches from my waist, but I in no way look thin.  My first food rule is to never turn down food that is offered if you don't have to carry it. I seldom feel hungry, but I can always eat.  Thru hiking requires lots of energy, so I look for foods that provide the greatest amount of calories per ounce. It's important to find foods you like, because choking down food you don't like is never fun.  That being said, if I'm looking at granola bars, for instance, and one has ten more calories than the other, I choose the one with higher calories.  For me, protein and fiber are secondary to calories, both carbs and fats. This is not a way you want to eat for the long haul, but it has gotten me this far. Here is a typical menu for a day on the trail.  Breakfast: one Clif Bar with nut filling, one Kind bar, and one Little Debbie fudge brownie.  Snacks (eaten throughout the day): two Snickers bars, one Luna bar, one trail mix granola bar, one Special K protein bar, and one small bag of peanuts or almonds.  Lunch: one Spam single, two string cheeses, one large flour tortilla, one two-bar pack of Little Debbie Nutty Buddy bars, one Little Debbie fig bar, two Slim Jim and Cheeses, one pack of peanut butter crackers, and one small box of raisins. Supper: one Knorr pouched meal (I try all kinds to mix things up a bit), one mayonnaise packet (to add fat), and one Nutrigrain bar. I welcome any comments or suggestions, as there are as many hiker diets as there are hikers, and I am always willing to try (most) new things.","David Lesser Memorial Shelter Tent Site

For no apparent reason, I awoke early and was up and ready for some serious touristing by 6:00.  I was the first customer of the day in the little cafe on the second floor of the Town's Inn.  James, the new chef, quickly whipped me up a breakfast of eggs, toast, and country ham.  James, who is originally from Mississippi, told me he was in West Virginia due to losing a bet.  A friend bet him he would like it better here and told him to come visit for two weeks.  After two weeks he was ready to return home but his car broke down. He got a job to get the money to fix his car.  That was over three years ago, and he is still here.  He said he really does like Harpers Ferry and was enjoying his new job.  He certainly did a fine job preparing my breakfast. I was joined by U-Turn, a hiker I met yesterday.  It turns out that she is from Kansas City.  A retired educator like I am, she has previously hiked the Colorado Trail and is making good time on the AT, having started in late April.  Mechanic joined us a bit later, and we all hung around chatting with James for awhile.  It was then time for me to head out into town.  My first destination was the Visitors Center.  I got my Civil War geek on big time this morning at the Center. I met Bill, an amateur historian who volunteers at the center.  He gave me a tour of the museum and we got into a fascinating discussion about Harpers Ferry and its role in the Civil War.  I thought I was there about thirty minutes. Upon checking my watch, I realized I had been talking with Bill for nearly two hours.  Afterwards, I went to look at John Brown's Fort and the armory grounds as well as the confluence of the Potomac and the Shenandoah Rivers.  From there, it was a short walk to the Almost Heaven Bar and Grill for lunch. I ran into Yard Sale there. She was just getting her fish and chips and invited me to join her.  Her lunch looked so good that I ordered the same thing.  We've met before a few times along the trail.  The first thing I noticed about her was her purple Philmont shirt.  I also own a purple Philmont shirt from when I hiked there with my son, Greg, in 1999. Yard Sale hiked there with her Venture Crew in 2012, and that trek sparked her love of backpacking. We discussed our hiking philosophies and what we like best along the trail. We agreed that it was the quality of people we keep meeting along the way.  She planned on hiking out after she visited the outfitters, and I don't hit the trail again until tomorrow morning. Hopefully, we'll meet again. After lunch, I stopped by Scoops and purchased what turned out to be a huge two scoops of black raspberry ice cream in a waffle cone.  I ran into Dutch again, whom I haven't seen in weeks. We caught up with each other and swapped phone numbers.  I then took the rest of my ice cream cone     back to the hostel and finished it there. I was sitting outside letting lunch settle and watching the people when Debbie stopped by.  I first met Debbie when she came by last evening to check on the towels in my room. I come from a large family (I am the second of nine), but Debbie is ""eighth from the bottom"" of a family of fourteen.  She is very proud of her family, many of whom have served in the military.  She is particularly proud of her granddaughter, Haley, who has recently enlisted in the Air Force. She promised me last night she would bring a photo of her by to show me today.  Haley looks to be a beautiful young woman who is making her grandmother justifiably very proud. Next on my must-do agenda was to visit the John Brown Wax Museum just down the street from the Town's Inn. I was disappointed when I saw the Closed sign at on the door. I was turning away when Miss Alyssa saw me and promised that she would be back to reopen in ten minutes. I spent the time hurrying over to the train station because I heard a train coming.  I actually got to witness two long freights pass each other on parallel tracks. There have been a large number of trains though town today, including passenger trains, which made this train lover very happy.  I then walked back to the museum and observed the life of John Brown brought to life through wax. The museum tells the story of Brown""s turbulent life through the use of eighty-seven life-sized wax statues.  It was a lot of fun and featured several buttons to push to provide narration and sound effects.  I haven't been to a wax museum since I visited Madame Tussauds in London.  I had a great time looking at each scene and feel it was seven dollars well spent.  I chatted with Alyssa afterwards. She highly recommended the ghost tour, but, unfortunately, I won't be able to fit that in before I head out.  Perhaps this is a reason to return to Harpers Ferry in the future. Believe it or not, I felt like going for a walk, so I headed up High Street back to the ATC headquarters.  I spent some time there chatting with hikers and the staff and took the opportunuty to actually use the ""privy.""  I then strolled back to my room, took a brief nap, and then met U-Turn and Blood Mountain for dinner.  I met Blood Mountain several days ago.  He actually met Mike first at the hostel Mike stayed in the night before he met us. Blood Mountain made it to Harpers Ferry today and plans to take the train to Washington D.C. and spend a few days there. We ate dinner at the Potomac Grill. I decided to mix it up and had a chicken parmesan sandwich, chips, and a pickle, washed down with an Amber ale. It was a great way to wind down my tourist day. I returned to my room, packed some things for tomorrow, and called some family members.  I then went to bed to get a good night's sleep before heading back onto the trail tomorrow.  Gravity and his friend Ralph, who will be joining us for a few days, will be meeting me tomorrow at 8:00.  We'll have a brief hike through Harpers Ferry,  before crossing the Potomoc River on the Byron Memorial Footbridge. We'll then be in Maryland. The first part of the trail tomorrow follows the C&O Canal Towpath which should provide some very easy hiking.  But that's for tomorrow,  and I'm heading back to bed now.  Today was a great zero day, and I am ready to be back on the trail.","Harpers Ferry, West Virginia

I was in bed last night listening to the sounds of young hikers talking outside, when Mechanic came in to tell me Pippi was there.  I immediately got up to see here.  I hadn't seen Pippi since the bear ""blessing"" on Big Rock.  She excitedly filled me in on the details of her bear sighting.  I stayed up visiting for about an hour.  Eric (now, Pick of the Litter) was also there.  We met standing by the AT plaque atop Springer Mountain, and I have not seen him since. I finally went back to bed around 1:00 and left the younger ones to their own devices. I was up again at 6:30, and Gravity and Kim picked me up at 8:00 to get back to the trail.  We were joined by Gravity's friend, Ralph, who plans on hiking with us to Waynesboro. Ralph is sixty-three and a candidate for hip replacement due to an injury, so it was a tad embarrassing when he blew by me later in the day. Seriously, we hiked together a good part of the day, and he is a friendly, interesting man.  The three of us walked through Harpers Ferry and past Jefferson Rock on our way out of town.  Jefferson Rock is perched atop a rock ledge. It now rests on pillars after being badly damaged by troops during the Civil War.  We then walked past Lower Town and crossed the Potomac River into Maryland on the Byron Memorial Footbridge. We walked beside the railroad tracks but, sadly, no train passed us while we were on the bridge.  The first 2.6 miles of the AT in Maryland follow the C&O Canal Towpath and is said to be the only truly flat section of the trail.  It is remindful of rails to trails, although the towpath was used by the animals used to tow barges down the canal back in the day.  As the trail left the towpath and started up the mountain to the Weverton Cliffs, the flat was over.  As we prepared to reenter the mountains, we were passed by Dory and Splat, who had spent yesterday in Harpers Ferry with Momma and Poppa Dory.  It was great to see them again.  The first climb in Maryland was moderately difficult, but I soon was past the summit, and the trail became appreciably easier. I ate lunch at the Ed Garvey Shelter with Ralph, Dory, Gravity, and Splat. This shelter is quite nice and features a second story that is reached via a balcony located on the back of the shelter.  I climbed the balcony, but no one else was interested in rehearsing Romeo and Juliet.  The 0.4 side trail to water at the shelter is rumored to be the steepest climb in Maryland, but I had plenty of water so I didn't have to check that out.  Maryland only allows camping at designated shelter and camping areas along its 40 miles of the AT, but they do provide ample opportunities along the way.  I made good time to Gathland State Park, which contains an empty tomb, constructed by a man named Gath years before his demise.  Unfortunately, he later lost his fortune and was buried, penniless, in Pennsylvania.  His empty tomb still remains.  The park also is home to the War Correspondents Monument, an impressive structure commemorating the role of news reporters, photographers, and artists in documenting the Civil War.  As I walked past the monuments, I noticed Dory and Splat were at a pavilion with a group of young girls.  Girl Scout Troop 81283 was providing Trail Magic for hikers.  I was offered an ice cold drink and Girl Scout cookies. Thank you, Julia, Carly, Gracyn, and your moms for brightening my day!  The trail continued to allow for good time, and I was soon at White Rock Cliff, which provided one of the views for today.  We decided to bypass Rocky Run Shelter and continue the extra 1.8 miles to the Dahlgren Backpack Campground, which features tent spaces, picnic tables, and a restroom with flush toilets and showers.  Reserved for backpack campers only, there was a good mix of thru hikers, section hikers, and overnight hikers at the campground.  Before arriving there, we also hiked through Fox Gap, looked at the Reno Monument, and read the signs describing the bloody conflict that occurred there prior to the battle of Antietam.  We arrived at the campground at 7:30 having covered 17.2 miles today.  It is hard to believe I am now in my sixth state and will be in Pennsylvania the day after tomorrow.  I felt slow and lethargic this morning, probably a combined result of my zero day yesterday and the heat, but I perked up this afternoon.  It's a good feeling to be back on the trail.","Harpers Ferry, West Virginia

I awoke to my alarm, which was set for 5:30.  I don't normally set an alarm, but we talked about trying to make eighteen miles today, and that would require an early start. It is also starting to get hot during the day, and I like hiking in the cooler morning.  We were on the trail by 7:00, headed for the first destination of the day, and something I have wanted to see for a long time: the Washington Monument. No, I didn't catch the Amtrak to Washington, D.C. back in Harpers Ferry.  This is the original Washington Monument.  The good people of Boonesboro, Maryland, back on July 4, 1827, decided to celebrate their independence by constructing the first monument dedicated to our first President.  The entire town paraded up the hill behind an American flag and went to work.  Constructed of stone, they were able to complete the first fifteen feet that first day.  Farming duties called, and the work did not continue until September, when the monument was completed.  Built without morter, the monument fell onto hard times.  It was modified several times and was used by Union troops as an observation post during the Civil War.  It was ultimately returned to its original appearance, this time secured with morter, as a CCC project in 1934-1936.  It is a wonderful structure, and I was able to climb the winding staircase to the observation deck on top.  It was possible to see the Antietam battlefield, as well as look back on West Virginia and forward to Pennsylvania.  There is a stone courtyard with benches built into the back of the monument , and Splat, who we met there along with Dory, took my picture.  After lingering for awhile, it was time to get back on the trail.  The next destination was the Annapolis Rocks.  To get there, it was necesary to cross Highway I-70/US 40 on a footbridge.  It is a caged in bridge, and lots of truckers blow their horns for you as you cross over, which was pretty exciting.  The subsequent trail to the Annapolis Rocks was quite steep but wide and smooth.  There is a magnificent view, and I sat awhile taking it in before hiking down to a spring for water and returning to the trail. I ate my lunch and continued on.  The weather became quite warm, and I found myself struggling to stay awake while walking.  It was the same feeling I get trying to drive after eating.  After fighting this for a mile and a half, I finally gave in at the side trail to the Pogo Memorial Campsite.  I took out my little sitting mat, found a pretty flat grassy area, and took a nap.  I slept maybe a half an hour when I was awoken by the voices of Gravity and Ralph.  They did not see me and would have gone right by if I hadn't woken up.  I am considering building nap time into my daily schedule on hot days, since I felt much better after my snooze.  It was a good thing I became more alert because Miss Maryland, not wanting to leave all of the fun to her sisters, decided to get all rocky and scrambly on us. The next few miles of trail rivaled the best (or worst) of the rocky trail I have seen. To add extra zest, a thunderstorm began, and the rocks got wet and slippery.  The storm never really amounted to much, and we hiked in sporadic rain the rest of the way. As Ralph and I were climbing one hill, I got to see my second rattlesnake.  This one was a brown timber rattler who must have been approaching the trail as I walked by.  I heard the rattling just behind me on my left, before the snake was on the trail and quite loudly announcing to Ralph that he was an unwelcome visitor.  Unfortunately my phone was in my belt pouch protecting it from the rain, so I couldn't get a picture.  His dignity intact, the rattlesnake quickly slithered off the trail and into the brush. We soon arrived at the Ensign Cowall Shelter Tent Site and decided that we'd had enough hiking for one day.  It was only a bit after five, and we enjoyed a leisurely supper before getting an early bedtime.  We visited with Pippi and JC before we all headed for our tents and bed.  We have 12.4 miles to road PA 16 tomorrow, where we will get a shuttle into Waynesboro for resupply. We'll be saying goodbye to Ralph, although he said he may try to meet up with us for more fun and adventure later in the hike. It was a day of varied experiences, with a mix of sun and rain, man-made and natural attractions,  and easy and very challeging trail conditions. We are a tad shy of ten miles to the state border, where we will say goodbye to Maryland and hello to Pennsylvania as we cross the Mason-Dixon Line.  Except for the heat, I have really enjoyed Maryland, and I'm looking forward to beginning State Number Seven tomorrow.","Dahlgren Backpack Campground

We got up early again this morning, as there were 12.4 miles to cover to get to the road to Wayneaboro, and we wanted to get there as early as possible.  The heat continues to be an issue for everyone as well, so we also wanted to cover as much ground as possible before the heat of the day.  We were on trail a little after 7:00, but it would ultimately take us nearly ten hours to cover those 12.4 miles. The trail was moderately difficult as we approached Warner Gap Road and became quite rugged and steep toward Raven Rock.  It was here that I met a group of young women hiking along the trail. They were Girl Scouts from a local camp who were in the second day of a five day backpacking adventure. We had a great talk about hiking and the importance of encouraging young women to get outdoors and have adventures.  I told the young women about all of the women thru hikers I have met and about my daughter who will be hiking with me in Vermont.  Kudos to these scouts and to their leaders, Ricola and Trippz, for looking for new adventures and proving that Girl Scouting can incorporate great outdoor experiences.  I continued on toward our next destination, High Rock.  Along the way, I saw a tree that should be called Woodpecker Cafe.  Painted with a white blaze, it was riddled with a string of deep holes where woodpeckers have dined.  It made for a great picture.  High Rock was interesting. Located right beside a paved road and parking lot, High Rock is easily accessible. Perhaps as a result of this, it is completely covered in very colorful graffiti. I'm sure this is controversial, but I kind of liked the explosion of color. I had expected to see single markings and perhaps vulgar words, but instead found a riot of incomprehensible color. The view was absolutely spectacular.  The hike from High Rock to Pen Mar County Park was an extremely steep and rocky descent, and the heat of the day was beginning to take its toll. I arrived at the park, filled my water bottles in a drinking fountain, and ate my lunch. Gravity and Ralph soon joined me.  There is a pavilion in the park that boasts a beautiful view and I took a photo from there. Storm clouds started to quickly gather, and we all headed back to this pavilion. Within minutes, the area was engulfed in a very strong thunderstorm. Safe under the pavilion, I actually took a brief nap. It only lasted about fifteen minutes, and the sun was back out. I took a photo from the pavilion during the storm and another immediately afterwards, and the difference is striking. After the storm, the heat and humidity returned with a vengence. Just after the park, I passed another major milestone as I passed from South to North, from the Apa-Latch-ain to Apa-Lay-tian Trail, as I crossed the Mason-Dixon Line from Maryland to Pennsylvania.  I am now in my seventh state. There is a sign and a nice monument. I set some of Beau free at the state line before continuing northward to Highway 16.  The initial trail in the Keystone State contined today's theme of rough and rocky. We finally reached the highway around 5:00 and decided to try our luck hitching into town. Our thumbs were in the air less than three minutes when Sockfat (a 2014 thru hiker) and Harshini stopped in their Honda Element. In a few minutes, we were all three tucked into the back of the vehicle along with our packs, trekking poles, and a bicycle.  It was admittedly cozy, but we all fit.  We all posed for a photo outside the hotel.  Sockfat said he was simply returning some of the kindness he received during his journey.  Thanks again for the lift! After checking into the hotel and showering, Gravity, Ralph, and I walked to the Monterey Pass Pub and Eatery for dinner.  I had the General William Tecumseh Sherman Brisket Sandwich, which came with a half pound of fries. I also enjoyed a house salad and rounded the meal off with apple pie and ice cream.  The food was delicious and a great way to obtain those necessary carbs.  After dinner, we walked to Wal-Mart for resupply.  We then returned to the hotel to do laundry and sort out the four days of supplies that will get us to our next destination of Boiling Springs.  I was in the laundry room when who should rush in the door but Splat, followed by Momma Splat.  Splat had seen me through the door and went to get her mom.  We were soon joined by Poppa Splat and Dory.  It was a great place for a happy reunion with Momma Splat, and I was able to meet Poppa Splat for the first time.  We parents had a wonderful chat, primarily revolving around what tremendous children we have, and I shared photos of my children and, of course, Baby Rose.  We talked quite a while, and it was almost 11:00 before everyone headed for their rooms.  I still had food to sort and equipment to prepare.   We have a 9:00 shuttle arranged to take Gravity and me back to the trail and Ralph back to his car at Harpers Ferry.  It was a lot of fun sharing the trail with Ralph, and he hopes he can join us again later.  Splat and Dory will be at it again tomorrow as well as we continue to close in on the halfway point.","Ensign Cowall Shelter Tent Site

Ralph arranged a shuttle for 9:00 to first take Gravity and me back to the trail and then take him to his car in Harpers Ferry.  This allowed us to sleep in a bit, since last night was such a late one.  After a good continental breakfast at the hotel, we bid farewell to Ralph who may be able to rejoin us later, and arrived back at the trail.  The temperature was already rising, and it promised to be another warm, humid day.  As I talk to hikers, the universal concern right now is the heat.  The trail continues to often be rocky and rugged, but it is the heat and humidity that is making things tougher right now.  I have made a few adjustments.  I added Propel to my water today to help ensure I adequately replace the electrolytes I am sweating out.  I also slowed my pace a bit,  tied a bandanna to the shoulder strap of my pack to help wipe sweat from my face and to try to keep my glasses clean enough to see through, and I made sure to take a brief nap during the heat of the afternoon. Due to how late we were up last night and our late start this morning, as well as another day of warm temperatures and mostly challenging trail, Gravity and I opted to hike 12.3 miles to the Rocky Mountain Shelters area and not push on to the next possible camping area an additional five miles down the trail.  Availability of water also was a factor.  For some reason, most of the shelter areas now contain two mostly identical shelters.  They are very well maintained.  In fact, there was a vase of fresh flowers on the table at Tumbling Run. The structures here also provide a clue to why there are double shelters: one is labeled ""Snoring,"" while the other is ""Non-Snoring.""  We were treated to one view today at Chimney Rocks.  The best part was the scramble up the large rocks that jut out from and above the trees. There are three outcroppings to choose from. I took the middle while Gravity opted for the one on the right. The sky was clear, and there was a view of mountains and a large reservoir, but no little towns and roads.  I ate lunch at the Old Forge Picnic Area, another well maintained facility, that features shaded picnic tables, a water faucet, and a privy. There were several hikers already there.  I decided to eat my lunch early, before I became too worn out from the heat, to try to avoid the afternoon sluggishness that I have felt the past few days. Today was also a day of reunions. I saw Redeye for the first time since Harpers Ferry. She had found a  bright red artificial flower that she was wearing in her hair.  I later found it on the trail and was able to present it back to her at Chimney Rocks.  Being from Canada, the heat is new to her, but she is gamely hiking on.  I later saw her playing in a stream.  She loves the water, and it was also helping her cool off.  I also saw Pirate today for the first time in a long while. He had been forced to take nine zeroes in Daleville after contracting Lyme disease.  We caught up with each other while getting water from the spring at Rocky Mountain.  He says he feels better now, and he looks great.  I just re-treated my clothes with Permethrin in Waynesboro and have been dutifully using my insect repellent every day. This will obviously continue.  I was setting up my tent by 5:30 this evening, and I enjoyed a laid back, unhurried evening. I helped some hikers I just met build a fire, and they shared their bacon (pre-cooked but reheated over the fire) with me. I was in bed early and plan on an early start tomorrow.   The forecast is for more warm weather (it is July in Pennsylvania, after all), and I hope   the adjustments I have made will continue to pay off.  If trail conditions cooperate, Gravity and I may reach the half-way point as early as tomorrow.  Exciting times continue on the trail.","PA Highway 16/Waynesboro, PA

Rocky Mountain Shelters Tent Site to Toms Run Shelter Tent Site 19.2 miles Total miles:  1098.7
I planned on a bigger mileage day today for a few reasons.  First, I will be making it to Pine Grove Furnace State Park tomorrow,  and I wanted to get as close as possible today. There is an AT museum there I want to visit. Also, Pine Grove Furnace is home to the famous ""Half Gallon Challenge."" The goal is to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting to celebrate completing half of the AT.  Those who complete the challenge are rewarded with a small wooden spoon. I guess it really isn't all that difficult, because you still have to pay for the ice cream. Gravity is taking a bye on this, but I am all in.  All I need to do is decide on the flavor.  Also, if we make it to Toms Run Shelter today, we will pass the half way point.  I set my alarm for 5:30 but didn't start moving until 6:00.  I guess I needed the sleep.  We were on the trail by 7:45, which worked out fine.  At first the trail was very challenging, with lots of steep ascents and boulder scrambling. It was fun but very time consuming, and I was afraid we wouldn't get too far.  Fortunately, the trail for the rest of the day was much more conducive to making miles.  I was passed by Pick of the Litter during our rock scrambling. As I mentioned earlier, we first met at the bronze plaque on Springer Mountain.  He is such a friendly, outgoing young man.  He was meeting his parents today and was very excited.  We are two of the few people with Trail Names that get shortened.  I'm usually called, ""Stick,"" and he's usually called, ""Pick.""  I told him to tell his parents that they had done well.  The trail became noticeably easier, and I made better time.  That was until I came upon the Quarry Gap Shelter and met Innkeeper. Those who have read The Lord of the Rings will recall  when Frodo and his fellow Hobbits are rescued from Old Man Willow by a sprightly, enigmatic soul by the name of Tom Bombadil  (he did not appear in the movies).  Frodo and friends were then invited to spend some time with Tom and his wife Goldberry in their magical home in the forest. Now, I'm not being threatened by angst-ridden willows (although I trip over countless roots, but that's another story) and horses aren't allowed on the AT so I have no fear of Black Riders, but weary hikers feel the same reaction that the Hobbits must have felt at the Bombadil's when they enter Quarry Gap Shelter.  I was lucky enough to meet Jim Stauch, aka ""Innkeeper,"" as he was trimming unwanted vegetation from the land around the shelter.  Jim has been the caretaker of the shelter on this spot for forty-two years, and he is the one who designed the present shelter, which was built in 1994.  The entire place is designed to make you feel at home.  You enter through a fenced gate and immediately notice the flowers and shrubs (all native species).  There is a sundial by the path to the lovely spring that feeds into a small pool.  You almost expect to see an elf.  I did not need water, but I replenished my bottles anyway, just to be able to get water from the pool.  There is a special table for stoves, and a pavilion, decorated with hanging plants, over the picnic table.  The sleeping area is immaculate and well designed for comfort. There is an additional picnic table there with a shelf containing board games and reading material.  Three little stone turtles decorate the base of a tree. A porch swing is located by the shelter, and I rested there while I talked with Innkeeper. He is a proud member of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club, and he oversees the shelter and twelve miles of trail.  He told me that his goal is to make anyone who enters his shelter area feel at home. I happily fell under his spell, and Gravity and I chose to eat lunch there, even though it was early for me.  Innkeeper informed us that the area is also home to a chipmunk and a black snake. The black snake effectively keeps down the mouse population, a chronic problem with shelters. It apparently tolerates the chipmunk.  Innkeeper says he has seen them in close proximity many times, and the snake never bothers the chipmunk. I saw the chipmunk scamper across the yard but never saw the snake.  Innkeeper is a wonderful, caring man who is passionate about the PATC, the AT, and hikers.  I am so glad that he happened to be there, and that I was able to meet him and spend some time with him.  I even visited the privy, even though there was no need.  You betcha, the interior was panelled and there were air fresheners inside.  Not every shelter needs to, or even should be, so homey,  but I applaud Innkeeper for creating such a marvelous oasis at Quarry Gap. I have never slept in any of the many shelters along the AT, but I would make an exception at Quarry Gap.  Although I had no magic ring to dispose of, it was still time to go after spending over an hour at the shelter.  The trail was very well maintained and not too difficult.  I made good.progress toward my destination.  It was another warm day, and I am happy to report that my new warm-weather interventions seem to be successful.  I stayed alert and energetic all day.  I was passing Milesburn Cabin when I met Kevin and Matt. They rented the cabin from the PATC and were sitting in camp chairs in the stream drinking beer.  They asked me if I wanted anything to drink, and I gratefully accepted some ice cold water to fill my bottles.  We discussed the differences in our vacations.  They said they were pretty confident they would prefer drinking cold beer in a stream to spending five to six months hiking up and down mountains.  To each his own, I suppose. Anticipation grew as Gravity and I neared Mile 1049.9, located on Dead Woman's Hollow Road.  This is the 2017 halfway point. There is a permanent marker a few miles down the trail that I will pass tomorrow, but we reached the actual midpoint around 5:00.  Redeye was there, and we all posed for a selfie. There was a sign asking us to record in the journal new things we have learned since being on the trail. I responded that I have learned how to spell, Amacolala Falls, ""usually."" Gravity later pointed out that it is actually spelled, ""Amicalola,"" so I'm glad I added the usually bit. I also said that I learned that you will eventually get to your destination if you follow the white blazes.  After celebrating this huge milesctone,  we set out for Toms Run Shelter.  We had a reunion at the tent site area because Redeye, Boomer, Jason, and Maple were already there.  We had a great chat while we all prepared our dinners and played with Maple.  Tomorrow will be the Half Gallon Challenge and  continuing our way to Boiling Springs.  It's hard to believe that I am now closer to Katahdin than I am to Springer.","Rocky Mountain Shelters Tent Site

Happy Birthday, America!  I woke up at 4:30 this morning and quietly stayed in bed resting, figuring to get up at 6:00.  I fell back asleep at 5:55 and woke back up at 6:30. Today was the big day: I'd make it to Pine Grove Furnace State Park,  home of the famous AT Half-Gallon Challenge.  No one else in camp planned on taking on the challenge. Most said they didn't think they could eat that much ice cream without getting sick. Actually,  I know myself and ice cream pretty well and knew it really wouldn't be much of a challenge, but I'd read about it for years and was ready to take it on.  I headed out about 8:00 and soon came across the official half-way monument.  I set a bit of Beau free at the monument and was soon joined by two other hikers, one of.whom took my photo.  I then continued on the three mile walk to the state park.  Pennsylvania is often called Rocksylvania in AT parlance due to the legendary rock fields that must be crossed in the north of the state.  While there are certainly rocky sections now, I am finding southern PA home to some of the most welcoming hiking I have found on the entire AT.  Granted, there are few views to photograph, but the trail winds through pretty woodlands with tall trees and underbrush thin enough to allow views through the trees.  I haven't seen any large wildlife but have encountered many squirrels and chipmunks, and walk among the songs and calls of countless birds. I scared a poor black snake sunning itself on the trail, and it quickly crawled into the woods.  The experience is really quite beautiful and pleasant despite the heat.  I soon arrived at the park and prepared for the challenge.  I only ate two of my three breakfast bars prior to leaving camp this morning and ate no snack bars on the trail, so I was primed and ready. The ice cream delivery truck had not yet arrived, so my choices were limited. I opted for Neapolitan for two reasons. One, it provides for different tastes within the same carton. Two, it was the only type they had.  Ice cream no longer comes in half gallons, so to complete the challenge, you eat the ice cream in the carton and then purchase an additional pint.  The record for consuming a half gallon of ice cream at the store is eight minutes and forty-five seconds. That guy reportedly ate it with his hands. I have standards; no hands. I also only carry a plastic spoon, and the ice cream was hard frozen, so I borrowed Gravity's metal one. As I expected, it really wasn't much of a challenge for me.  I chatted with a very nice family of four who were preparing for a bike ride, posed for pictures from another customer who wanted a record of an actual thru hiker taking the challenge, and enjoyed the experience of eating ice cream. I finished the carton in short order and opted for a pint of moose tracks.  Total time: thirty-two minutes. Total cost: $9.99.  Total reward: a tiny wooden spoon stamped with the words, ""Member of Half Gal. Club."" I expect it will become a family heirloom to pass down for generations.  After finishing the ice cream, I realized I was still hungry, so I ordered a hamburger and a large fries.  The hamburger was delicious, with an excellent bun and lots of toppings.  The large fries were, well, large. For the first time this entire journey I opted to not eat all of the food before me, and I shared my fries with Gravity and Jason.  Frankly, I am a little surprised my food binge did not affect me the rest of the day.  Like a snake that eats a rat and then nothing else for a week, I ate no other food until 7:30 this evening when I dined in camp after hiking an additional eleven miles. However, I felt no ill effects from my feeding frenzy.  After leaving the restaurant, Gravity and I paid a brief visit to the AT museum located in the park.  There were some interesting displays concerning the origins of the trail, one of the original shelters, and a children's exhibit in the basement.  It is an interesting and informative place. I signed the registry before leaving to walk through the throngs of happy Americans celebrating our country's birthday in the park.  There were hundreds of visitors, and I was pleasantly struck by the enormous diversity of this nation's citizenry. I waved to and was waved at by many people as Gravity and I walked through the park.  It's our third hot, sweaty day of hiking since that last shower in Waynesboro, so we tended to keep a wide berth.  Fellow hikers are all used to basically stinking, and it isn't that big a deal, but I do try to be considerate of other people's olfactory nerves, particularly the ones who smell of soap, deodorant, and body sprays. We were soon back in the comfort of the woods, where the shade helped against the heat.  I hiked along until around 2:00 before finding a quiet glade with a comfortable looking tree.  I leaned my pack against the tree, sat upon my little mat, and took a glorious power nap. I dozed for perhaps fifteen minutes and was ready for the rest of the day.  I hiked until 7:00.  The trail was almost deserted. I figure most folks were celebrating our nation's independence in more traditional ways.  Gravity and I camped in an unnamed camping site along a little stream, where we heard fireworks, even if we couldn't see them. We ate dinner, hung the food bags, and went to bed.  The plan for tomorrow is to eat lunch in Boiling Springs and then hiking to Carlisle, where we will resupply for the next section of the journey. I'm going back to sleep now, but before I do, I want to wish everyone a happy and healthy Fourth of July.","Toms Run Shelter Tent Site

Note:  I have now uploaded the photos for Waynesboro to Carlisle.
I slept well and was ready for the trail by 7:30.  The beginning of today's hike was a rather steep and rocky ascent culminating in the Rock Maze, a fun and challenging trek through two large boulder fields on top of a ridge a few miles prior to entering the Cumberland Valley.  While not overly difficult, the mazes provide a fun change of pace as you are required to follow arrows and blazes over large boulders and through narrow crevices to work your way to the other side.  It almost had the feel of an amusement park attraction and was a lot of fun. In one portion of the maze, the person responsible for marking the trail thoughtfully pointed southbounders in the direction of Georgia by adding ""GA"" under a southbound arrow. Unfortunately, the ""ME"" sign for us Nobos was faded almost to the point of indecipherability.  We'll get little help from the Rock Mazes to find our way to Katahdin. The Rock Mazes were an enjoyable diversion from normal trail hiking and provided a sense of accomplishment without actually being all that difficult.  They are a great piece of trail design and a lot of fun.  The trail remained hilly for as few more miles until reaching the summit of Center Point Knob, where the third, and last, halfway marker for the AT is located. Placed just prior to entering the Cumberland Valley, the midway point of the original trail is commemorated by a bronze plaque attached to a stone.  The AT has a long and storied past, which is reflected in this plaque located high on a hill.  The trail then descends into the Cumberland Valley and, for perhaps the first time, there were no mountains to climb. It is an odd experience to know that a road is a half mile away and to actually be able to see the road. I love it when the AT comes up with something new. The trail in the valley is flat or follows mildly undulating hills, running past farmlands of corn and soybeans.  There is a quiet beauty to these pastoral scenes, and I fear they will be forgotten when the foot-weary hiker encounters the infamous Pennsylvania Rock Fields.  I was able to watch two fawns cavorting playfully across a field, obviously lost to any concern other than the joy of playing in the sun.  I witnessed a farmer in a large John Deere go about his business and looked over vast fields of crops.  The hiking was easy and relatively fast, as there were few grades to confront and relatively few rocks.  Interestingly, my legs and knees were much more sore this evening than usual.  I wonder if I was using my muscles and joints in subtlety different ways today, and my body is telling me about it.  About a mile and a half into the valley, the AT runs directly through the town of Boiling Springs.  I really like it when the AT goes through towns.  The trail follows the bank of a beautiful lake before heading out of town on First Street and then back into the woods.   There is an AT regional office right off the trail where I stopped in to say hi and to get water.  There is also a well-equipped outfitters where I purchased new water bags for my Sawyer filtration system.   We were informed by a sign on the Boiling Springs Tavern that hikers were not welcome: ""Proper attire required.""  We figured four-day-old, nasty, wet hiking garb might not be considered proper attire. Instead, we dined at the Caffe 101, where we could eat outside.  I had a chicken cheese steak sandwich, chips, and a pickle, washed down with their signature lemonade tea and a Gatorade.  It was delicious, and we were made to feel very welcome indeed.  I met Wild Card there and heard some bad news.  As you may recall, Wild Card was one of the four hikers who completed a forty mile slackpack into Damascus some time back.  He told me he badly sprained his ankle hiking into Harpers Ferry, and it was not healing.  He was headed home to Connecticut today to rest it in hope that he may be able to return to the trail. It is a somber thought that one single misstep has the potential to end your journey. I wish him a fast recovery and hope he can get back on the trail soon.  Today's original plan was to stay and resupply in Boiling Springs, but the weather was cool, the sky was overcast, the trail was good, and the town of Carlisle was only eight miles away.  We made the distance in good time and climbed down a side trail onto US Highway 11.  We headed west for the half mile walk to the Days Inn.  They offer a hiker rate, and Gravity and I wanted a shower and clean clothes.  The hotel is on the opposite side of a very busy highway, so we walked down to cross at the light.  Instead of pedestrian crossing lights, we found signs expressly prohibiting walking across the highway.  I find it odd that a hotel would have a hiker rate, but a town would forbid someone from walking to the hotel. Being rule followers, Gravity and I waited for the highway to get a red light and for the left turners to do their thing. We then ran across the highway. The sign said nothing about running.  We checked in, took showers, and got ready to do laundry.  After laundry was started, I noticed a large, unsightly stain on the carpet.  I then realized the carpet was wet from where my sweat infused clothing had been piled.  Hopefully, it will fade by morning. Wearing clean clothes, we went next door to the Middlesex Diner for dinner. I had manicotti with meatballs, a house salad, macaroni salad, garlic bread, cottage cheese with apple butter, and homemade tapioca with whipped cream for dessert. It appears my hiker hunger is alive and well. I'll feed the beast again at the continental breakfast in the morning before we hike out to continue through the Cumberland Valley, headed inevitably closer to ""Rocksylvania.""","Unnamed Campsite at Mile 1113.5

I did not wake up until 7:30 this morning, but, when I did, I  felt rested and refreshed.  I got dressed and ate a good breakfast at the hotel's continental breakfast.  I made a waffle and also had cereal and a bagel.  Gravity and I were out of the hotel by 9:00.  We hiked back up the busy highway to the walkover bridge and were back on the AT by 9:15.  The day started in the pastoral beauty of the Cumberland Valley,  but was not destined to end that way.  I made good time as I passed barns with cattle feeding outside, as well as fields of corn, soybeans, and wheat.  The trail was good and the elevation changes gentle.  There were several examples of quite impressive trail construction in getting the trail past boggy, marshy areas.  There were numerous wooden walkways through the valley, some of them quite long.  Later, I would be even more amazed at the trail construction through the rock fields I encountered later in the day. Four miles into tbe day, I crossed under PA 944 through a nifty tunnel and bid goodbye to the Cumberland Valley.  The trail immediately became progressively steeper and rockier,  and soon I was hiking on trail that I consider more typically AT.  It had been a wonderful change of pace to hike in farmland for the past  fifteen miles or so, but now it's back to mountains, gaps, and hills. Rain was in the forecast, and it began around 11:00.  It rained pretty much the entire time I hiked today, and it was the type of rain I love for hiking.  It rained steadily but never stormed.  The temperature was cool but still warm enough that I never put on my rain jacket.  I find this type of rain invigorating and, while I did need to be aware of slippery rocks, the trail never got particularly muddy.  Water falling from the sky does not equal water in a drinking bottle. Although the lower temperature and cool rain meant I drank less, I still needed to pay attention to available water sources, as water availability is an issue on this section of trail. As I entered the more rugged trail, my guidebook indicated that there was a piped spring where the AT crosses an overgrown dirt road. I was looking for signs of an old dirt road when I came across an old wreck of a vehicle resting upside down alongside the trail. I figured this was a clue that an old road was nearby, and  I quickly located the spring and filled my water bottles.  Gravity came along while I was filtering my water and suggested we attempt  to hotwire the old vehicle and drive to Maine.  Any attemots would be in vain, so we decided to keep walking. The misty fog grew thicker. I was able to take a photo of a hazy mountain view from an unnamed outcropping early in the day, but visibility was soon down to perhaps thirty feet.  The fog helped focus me on the job at hand (paying close attention to my feet and the rocks) since I couldn't see much of anything else.  This was important as the trail by this time was quite rocky.   For some reason, I was really tuned in to hiking through the rocks today. Much of the trail was made up of rocks with dirt between, and I was doing a kind of disjointed jitterbug with my trekking poles and my legs to dance between the rocks.  It was actually pretty fun. I originally planned to stop at Cove Mountain Shelter but arrived around 4:30.  I decided to continue the additional four miles to Duncannon, where I hoped to get a room at the Doyle Hotel, an old hotel (actually more of a hostel) with an attached restaurant, bar, and pool table.  It is well-known among hikers. There were still those four miles of rocks to get through, however, and the rocks in Pennsylvania are starting to get serious. The trail construction is amazing, with hundreds of stone steps ascending and then descending steep ravines. Sometimes there is no actual trail, and you work your way through the rocks by finding a way from one white blaze to the next. About a mile from Duncannon, there is an example of new trail construction that is pure AT. The guidebook warns, ""Old trail to west.  AT turns east  (uphill for Nobos)."" Uphill, naturally.  The ""old"" trail followed a forest road on a relatively gentle downward slope toward town.  The ""new"" trail abruptly leaves the road to the east and proceeds up a very steep incline.  It tops a ridge and then begins an incredibly steep decline that includes over one hundred stone steps (an estimate, as I was too busy maintaining my balance on the rain-slickened rocks to actually count). As difficult, and perhaps as pointless, as it was, I couldn't help but marvel at the work that went into constructing the trail.  I eventually made it down and found myself on the outskirts of Duncannon.  Duncannon is a long town, and the AT spends nearly two miles going through it.  The Doyle Hotel is located right on the trail just as you get into town.  Unfortunately, there were no rooms at the inn.  There is a hiker campground 1.5 miles down the trail at the other end of town, but the owner told me of a donation-only hostel a few blocks from the Doyle that is operated by the Duncannon Assembly of God Church.  I followed the trail down High Street until I saw a sign that read, ""Hikers Welcome!  Come as You Are!""  I stayed at the hostel and had a great time.  Located in the basement of their activity building, the hostel includes a shower and a complete kitchen. There are about ten of us staying here tonight. This evening we chatted and watched The Wizard of Oz on TV.  We also had quite a hiker feed, courtesy of Radio, Dirty Duck, and Shlog.  They found a ride to the grocery store to resupply before I arrived at the hostel. They also picked up the ingredients for a true hiker feed.  We all feasted on burritos and baked chicken and finished things off with watermelon.  There will also be bacon and eggs for breakfast.  It's hard to believe that only a few hours ago I was standing at the Doyle Hotel trying to sort out a plan.  This evening turned out to be just about perfect, thanks to the good will of many special people, both hikers and non-hikers. The hostel itself is a wonderful ministry of the church, and the hikers tonight, most of whom I have not met before, filled the room with camaraderie and joy.  As Radio said tonight, ""The trail provides.""  Of course, that means that there are wonderful people and organizations along the trail that provide for each other out of the goodness of their hearts. Tomorrow, Gravity and I will call for the free shuttle to the local grocery store, which is several miles away.  We'll resupply for five days and head for Port Clinton.  I received a text from Dapper Dan today, who lives near there.  He wants me to let him know when I arrive, so he can arrange some special trail magic for me through his family.  What an amazing journey I am on.","US 11, Carlisle, PA

Today marks my three month anniversary of starting the trail. It's quite a thought to realize I have now been doing this for a quarter of a year.  Everyone slept in at the hostel, and most of us started moving around 7:30.  We all pitched in preparing and eating a huge breakfast of bacon, cheesy scrambled eggs, and toast.  After helping clean up (people who know me will not be surprised to learn that I helped wash the dishes), Gravity and I called for the free shuttle to the local grocery store.  Located about a mile from the trail up a very dangerous to walk along highway, Mutzabaugh's Market sends an employee to pick up hikers anywhere in Duncannon.  Within minutes of calling, Kevin arrived in a minivan and took us to the store.  After we resupplied, he returned us to the hostel.  It was 11:30 before we started the almost two mile walk through Duncannon to the Susquehanna River.  Most of the walk was along High Street, a residential area of older but well-maintained homes.  As we passed a home with a huge bear statue in the yard, Gravity quipped that I finally got to see my bear.  The owner of the home was outside, and she graciously took my photograph proudly posing by her bear.  We soon reached the Susquehanna River,  which we crossed via a long highway bridge.  It is always exhilarating to me to cross major rivers on these huge bridges with traffic zooming close by.  I took a photo of the river knowing I would soon be seeing it from another vantage point from high on the ridge above.  The hike to the ridge was, as you would expect, steep and rocky. I did discover a disadvantage to eating a large amount of bacon before hiking.  I discovered to my chagrin that I smelled strongly of stale sweat, dirty socks, and bacon. I'm used to the stale sweat and old sock bit, but throw in bacon and I found myself hiking faster to try to get away from myself.  Hopefully it will fade, since my clothes won't be washed again until Port Clinton.  I was excited to get to the ridgetop for the views of the valley below.  There were a few areas in the boulder fields where I opted to toss my trekking poles ahead of me so I could use both hands to help me scramble over the rocks. I also sometimes unceremoniously scoot on my butt.  Whatever it takes, and I am seldomly refered to as graceful.  Once, I got a tad carried away and tossed my poles to an area below where the trail was located.  This required some extra rock negotiations, but I retrieved them with no harm done.  There were many views as the Susquehanna Valley slowly receeded below me, and several trains passed which I could sometimes see through the trees.  These views did not photograph well due to the tree cover, but I was able to take a pretty good photo from a rock outcropping at the top of the ridge.  I paused there awhile enjoying the view with Simple, a fellow thru hiker.  I then hiked on to the Clarks Ferry Shelter to get water and to eat lunch.  As I've mentioned, water availability is an issue in central PA, but the spring at Clarks Ferry boasts not one, but two pipes for filling containers.  Sort of cold and cold running water.  I knew I was a bit tired when I reached out to turn the water from the pipe off when my container was full.  I ate lunch with Simple, Gravity, and a really nice thru hiker from Austin, Texas whose name presently escapes me.  Hopefully I will meet up with him again.  The weather was quite warm and very humid, so I took a brief nap on the shelter floor before continuing on my way. I soon met a southbound hiker, who was somehow familiar.  I recognized him from somewhere but did not immediately recall from where. I knew it was from somewhere related to the AT but not from the trail itself. It was Lucky, who completed his thru hike in 2014 and hiked part of the way with the Hiking Vikings. I recognized him from their you-tube videos.  We had a good talk and joked about a very funny story he related on one of the videos. He told me that the Hiking Viking himself was close behind him.  I ran into Hiking Viking a bit later, as a steady rain began to fall. We first met during Trail Days, when he was there with Sharon and their adorable son, Asher. I reminded him that the first AT video I watched was his ""Tips From the Trail"" on hiking in the rain, so it seemed fitting that we met again during a summer shower. The Hiking Viking videos are on their you-tube channel, Between the Blazes, and are well done, fun to watch, as well as informative.  Viking asked me if I had an interesting trail story to relate, and I told him about being a possible Bear Summoner.  He asked if he could video my story.  I readily agreed, and the interview will play on his video channel beginning on June 25th.  We talked a bit longer before he wished me luck on the rest of my hike and cautioned me about the upcoming rock fields.  It was great to see him again and to meet Lucky.  Gravity came up while I was talking with Hiking Viking. It was getting late and the rain picked up in intensity, and we decided to hike together for awhile.   The rain turned cold and hard, and we both soon realized we were both pretty much done for the day.  We found a flat little area a bit off trail, waited for the rain to slacken a bit, and then set up camp.  One of the best things about a long distance hike is that you do not usually have to follow an exact schedule. The plan is to arrive in Port Clinton in five days, but both of us have enough food to carry us over extra time if needed.  The rain stopped soon after camp was set up. We ate our dinners, talked a bit, and then headed for bed.  I am continuing to make steady progress northward, and, like I've said before, Katahdin isn't going anywhere.  Like so many days on the trail, today was full of both expected events and unexpected surprises.  We'll have to wait to see what tomorrow brings, and this tired hiker is now going back to sleep."," Duncannon Assembly of God Church Hiker Hostel

I slept well and got a lot of rest after the short day yesterday.  I woke up at 6:00 and was on the trail by 7:30.  The trail was good, with quite a bit of rocks, although most allowed for stepping mostly on dirt using the disjointed jitterbug. It's amazing how quickly something can become the new normal. What I at one time considered moderately difficult, is now counted as pretty easy.  It reminds me of the old joke:  What did the snail say when he climbed on the turtle's back?  Wheeeeee!!!!  I guess everything is relative.  The trail presented me with no real problems today, and I hiked 18.3 strong miles.  About two miles in, the trail crossed PA 225 on a caged pedestrian bridge.  In the parking lot just past the bridge, I saw Leapfrog and Extra Mile, who I have not seen in weeks.  They live in the area and were just getting ready to leave their car for a twenty mile southbound slackpack. It was fun to catch up with each other.  They were kind enough to share some Gatorade, providing a fellow hiker with some Trail Magic.  It was a real treat to catch up with two of my favorite people on the trail, and I hope to see them again soon.  A few miles later,  I came to Peters Mountain Shelter.  The water source is notoriously difficult to get to, and I felt confident that I had enough water to make it to the next spring 6.4 miles away.  I rested a few minutes at the shelter and chatted with a man with a very shy Australian Shepard,  who did not seem to want her picture taken.  I never impose myself, so I have no photo of this very unique dog with the beautiful blue eyes.  I then hiked a few more miles and ate lunch at Kinter View. The view was of the nearby mountain range. I am finding that sometimes the best views are not always the natural ones, but along power cuts instead.  That was certainly the case today.  I stood under the audibly crackling power lines and took the best view photo of the day.  The rock formation at Kinter View was large and provided a shady place to eat and take a nap.  It was here that I met Phys. Ed, a 2014 thru hiker.  He told me there was a rumor out that a hiker feed was taking place near PA 325, which was four miles down the trail. I made good time, driven both by need to get water at the spring near the road, and to check out the chance for some more Trail Magic.  I reached the spring with water to spare, and drank a quart right there and filled my bottles.  I then headed down the trail toward the road.  I soon found that there was a new trail town that needed to be added to the guidebook.  It's called Billville and features an incredible restaurant and lounge, right along the trail in the woods.  Founded by Trail Angel Mary and her friend Chester, the mayor of Billville, there is only one requirement to becoming a citizen. You must promise that you will spend the rest of your life annoying and confusing the humorless.  I had no problem making that promise and was soon enjoying the benefits of being a citizen of Billville. Trail Angel Mary encouraged me to make a salad while she prepared two chicken sausage burritos for me. I also helped myself to homemade cookies, cake, and sodas.  I saw many hikers I knew and met several new ones.  Radio and Dirty Duck were there. They had planned for big miles today, but Mary's announcement that shrimp stew was on the menu for dinner, had them setting up their tents a few hundred feet from the city limits of Billville.  I also saw Simple and Bear King, the hikers I met yesterday. I found out how Bear King got his trail name, and learned he is the antithesis of me.  A section hiker, he began his hike several weeks ago in the Shenandoahs.  On his very first day he saw four bears.  Sigh . . .  I also met Bartender, Minutes, and Cantaloupe. Gravity came along and joined in as well. It was a fun and rowdy time.  Trail Angel Mary is a true gem and does all of this out of the goodness of her heart and her love of hikers.  I made a donation to help her be able to continue her magic, signed the hiker book, and got a huge hug before heading back on the trail. Trail Angel Mary is another one of the very special, unique personalities that make up the AT community.  I promised her I would send her a card after I summit.  We still had over six miles to go today, including a long ascent out of the valley.  Powered by Mary's trail magic, I made excellent time and arrived at the Yellow Spring campsite by 7:30.  I set up my tent and decided to go exploring.  One of the main reasons I wanted to camp at this site is its proximity to the ruins of an old coal mining settlement, reached by a 0.7 mile blue blazed trail which begins at the campsite.  Suffice it to say that the settlement ruins are not quite the draw that McAfee's Knob or Max Patch is on the AT.  The trail is rather overgrown and faded, so I decided to finish my explanations before dark.  I finally located a corner of a building foundation but didn't detect any other signs that there was once a community on the site.  I made it back to camp with no problem, finished my chores, and headed for bed.  It's been another very full day on the trail.  Who knows what tomorrow may bring.","Stealth Campsite at Mile 1153.3

I slept well, in spite of the one deer who continually wandered through the campsite for most of the night. I had heard about this wayward deer, who chews clothes from clotheslines and has chewn off the straps of trekking poles.  She reportedly is impossible to scare away. She appeared on schedule last night, but no one left anything out for her to chew.  I heard her numerous times last night, but she was gone by morning.  I was on the trail by 7:30.  For one of the few times, I walked through spider webs, meaning I was the first to walk the trail this morning.  Yellow Springs is a dry campsite, so I stopped at the spring about a mile down trail to get water.  The weather was cool and clear, and I made good time to Rausch Gap.  There had been a small community here, based on coal mining and repairing railroad equipment, but it was abandoned in 1910 due to the railroad relocating and the mine proving unproductive. There was an informative sign and map alongside the trail, and I saw several remains of stone foundations.  I made a side trip to the cemetery, led there by a dilapidated, wooden sign.  There were several blank flagstone markers, and three engraved stones, all dated 1854.  Poor John Proud, originally from Durham England, had a tough life. He died on May 18, 1854, aged 52 years & 16 days. His epitaph reads: 
Affliction sore long time I bore,All human skill was vain:Till God did please to give me ease,And free me from my pain.
Andrew Allen, also a native of England, met his death by accident at Gold Mine Gap, on June 9, 1854, aged 30 years, 2 months, and 17 days. I had difficulty deciphering his epitaph but gathered he was well respected and loved.  The saddest stone was for little Catherine, the daughter of John and Elizabeth Blackwood, who died June 16, 1854, aged 1 year, 1 mo. & 7 days. I know that child mortality was very high back then, but, being a father and a grandfather, I can only imagine the grief Catherine's parents must have endured.  I paid my respects and then continued to hike through the sparse ruins of their community.   The trail followed one of the old roads that had connected Rausch Gap to the rest of the world, as it started up Second Mountain (I don't know what happened to First Mountain).  The construction of the road had been arduous, as was still evident from how the ledge for the ten-foot wide road had been cut into the right side of the hillside with the resulting rocks being used as fill on the left side. It is still impressive, even today. The AT followed along, until the road veered to the right into a small gap, the aim being to make the trip over the mountain as easy as possible.  True to form, the AT veered left to continue quite steeply so it could go over the viewless summit of Second Mountain, only to meet up with the road again for a short time on the opposite side.  You just have to love this trail.  At the base of the mountain, the trail then led through a field on its way to Swatara Gap.  The field held a different kind of beauty, and I always enjoy the change in scenery. There was an area full of wild flowers with thousands of bees crawling over them collecting nectar.  It was quite a sight.  I ate lunch in a clearing by a stream, where I also got my water for the afternoon's hike.  It was an inviting place, and I took a short nap leaning against my pack, which was supported by a tree.  Refreshed, I then crossed the stream via one of the more interesting bridges I have encountered.  It was actually a large, fallen tree with a walkway built up to it.  Two notches are cut into the upper end to sort of help you get to the upper end of the tree, where there is a sharp, deep drop onto the ground.  It made me a little nervous, but I made it to the ground unscathed.  It was then a short hike to Swatara Gap. I walked awhile with Steve and Grace, who live in the area and were out for a day hike. They gave me some pointers about the up-coming rock fields and told me some information about the area. We walked across a very interesting, relocated railroad bridge before bidding them goodbye. I then crossed under I-81 and thought about the range of bridges I had encountered over the past mile or so.  Everything from makeshift trees, to relocated iron, to modern concrete.  Leaving the bridges, I returned to steep terrain and rocks.  The trail sharply rises out of the Swatara Valley, before following the ridge line northward.  The trail was oftentimes rocky, punctuated by areas of earthen trail.  Yesterday I commented that the best views have been from the power line cuts, and today, the AT made that official. The one view along the ridge line, labeled by a sign on a tree, was from an abandoned power cut.  However, a large amount of foliage has since grown up, which has the unfortunate affect of blocking part of the view.  The trail immediately leading to the view was all rocks, and you pretty much chose your own path from blaze to blaze.  Afterwards, the trail was smoother and ran through thick foliage that has overgrown the pathway.  I talked with Kirby, who I met while he was setting up his tent, and he told me he had found two ticks crawling on him today.  I didn't find any on me this evening, but I am going to reapply my bug repellent at lunchtime as an added precaution. I arrived at the William Penn Shelter tent site at 5:40, after a hike of eighteen miles. I set up camp, got water from a very nice piped spring (the water gave me a brain freeze), and prepared dinner. My guidebook gives both the mileage from Springer and to Katahdin, and I noticed that I am presently 1000.2 miles from Katahdin. Very early tomorrow, I will have less than one thousand miles to go.  That's something to contemplate while I go back to sleep to rest up for another day.","Yellow Springs Campsite

I slept until 6:15 this morning and wasn't ready for the trail until 8:00.  I received a pleasant surprise when I saw Speedy in his tent, which was set up near mine. He arrived after dark, after I went to sleep and before I woke up to write my journal.  He woke up long enough to say hello but was back asleep when I left.  I heard a dog barking when Gravity went to the spring for water. It was Maple, for Jason and she had also arrived late last night and camped at the site nearer to the spring. Just two tenths of a mile into my hike today, I passed the 1,189.8 mark.  This is significant, because at that point I was exactly 1,000 miles from Katahdin.  The trail was surprisingly good this morning for a few miles before the rocks set in.  There was a timeless feeling about today's hike because the range of difficulty changed frequently between almost rockless trail, to rocky trail that allowed for disjointed jitterbug walking, to rocky jumbles that required slow, careful choosing of each footstep.  After 1,200 miles of hiking, I have gotten pretty adept at knowing how fast I am traveling and when I will get to a destination.  Not so today.  It was actually a bit liberating to simply walk along until I arrived at a certain point, because my rate of walking speed was continually changing.  My first stop today was the 501 Shelter, which is considered one of the most deluxe shelters. It is quite fancy, indeed, and is completely enclosed.  There is even a caretaker that lives nearby.  The interior is well lit by a skylight, and there are hiker boxes, one with cast off equipment and the other with canned goods.  I didn't feel like eating a whole can of Spam (there were several), but I did settle on a can of Spagettios with meatballs. I had to pack out the can, but it was worth it. After checking out the solar shower and filling my water bottles, I moved on.  My  morning hike next led to two separate overlooks. Pennsylvania officially got into the scenic view business, as these lookouts, along with a few this afternoon, provided stunning views of miles of pastoral lands with farms, buildings, roads, and woods.  I watched a peregrin falcon circling below me, probably searching for its lunch.  I also met a little bird on the trail that I fear is not long for this world.  The little thing kept trying to fly, but instead would roll over on its back in a sort of somersault.  It looked old enough to fly and did not appear injured.  No frantic bird parent noises were present.  I spoke encouragingly to it for awhile (which I'm sure did a world of good) and ended up leaving it on its own.  When I asked if I could take its picture, it paused in its movements long enough for me to get a nice photo, but I am guessing this was a coincidence.  I'm fearful that the little guy will be some animal's snack if it doesn't get the flying thing figured out soon. I hiked on and was closing in on Round Head, another overlook where I was considering lunch, when I met Leapfrog and Extra Mile again.  Southbound slackpacking, they were kind enough to include Trail Magic for both me and Gravity, and they provided us with Gatorade, fresh fruit, and a huge chocolate chip muffin. Thanks, my friends, for the glorious and unexpected feast.  I still had room for lunch at Round Head (it's hard to beat a Spam and cheese burrito) and then took my now obligatory nap.  Refreshed, I hiked strong throughout the afternoon and evening of trail, again with vastly varying degrees of difficulty.   It is amazing how quickly something can become the new normal. Trail that I would have considered difficult earlier is now becoming commonplace.  I hope this continues when the trail becomes the legendary Rocksylvania. By mid-afternoon, in a clearing for a pipeline, I passed the 1,200 mile mark, commemorated with sticks and stones.  It's hard to believe that at this point, Mount Katahdin is 210 miles closer than Springer Mountain.  About six miles further on, I found a small, unnamed campsite area that will is serving as home tonight. Gravity showed up not long after I had my tent set up, and we ate dinner together before calling it a day.  We are a bit over eleven miles from Port Clinton and Hamburg, where we plan on our next resupply. A shower, clean laundry, and food all sound good as well.  The past few days have been strenuous, but I have enjoyed my journey through Pennsylvania so far and feel ready to take on the truly rocky road that lies ahead."," William Penn Shelter Tent Site

Note: I was able to upload the photos from Duncannon to Port Clinton tonight.
It rained a little last night, but not enough to even get the tent wet. I was on the trail a bit before 8:00 with an 11.6 mile hike ahead of me to get to Port Clinton.  The trail was typical for the area, with some very easy hiking interspersed with more difficult rock maneuvering.  I hiked through an area of planned-burn forest that was burned back in May.  The understory was lush and growing, so it appears the burn was a success.  I interrupted a family of chipmunks chasing each other around a tree.  It was fun watching their play. One posed long enough for a photo. I came across Leapfrog and Extra Mile slackpacking, and they had more goodies for me today. There was Clementine oranges, a honey bun, and French Vanilla coffee that Leapfrog had gotten from her hotel and poured into a Nalgene bottle.  She even remembered paper cups.  It wasn't hot, of course, but it was absolutely delicious, nonetheless. Thanks again, you two!  I made good time toward Port Clinton.  On a fallen tree across the trail, I came across a painted rock that was left there. I believe there is a significance, but I opted to take a photo of it and leave it for another hiker to find.  The descent into town was incredibly steep, but I was soon at the bottom, and entered Port Clinton.  I was excited to find that the trail into town first crossed the tracks of the Reading and Northern Railroad. A successful shortline railroad that employs over two hundred people, I learned a great deal about it from talking with Ray, an employee of the railroad who was kind enough to talk with me and understood my enthusiasm for railroads. I watched some switching being done and a maintenance car return to the home yard.  Ray told me the R&N RR also does excursion trips and even owns a steam locomotive that it runs on occasion.  I spent nearly an hour at the railroad before heading into town. The AT goes right though Port Clinton, which has an old-time charm that immediately impressed me.  Gravity stopped at the Post Office while I walked on to the Port Clinton Hotel.  Housed in an old building that used to serve as a stage coach stop, the hotel also includes a bar and restaurant.  I checked into the hotel and met Pam, who would later be our server at dinner.  The hotel understandably asks hikers to shower before coming in to eat.  Since the last shower I've had was before Duncannon, I was only too happy to oblige. While walking into town, I met Dory and Splat, who joined Gravity and me for dinner. We then all hung out in our room while we did our laundry.  Laundry takes on a huge significance on the trail. It still amazes me how bad a sock can smell only to come out of the washer and dryer all fresh and ready to get stinky again tomorrow.   Likewise, my hiking shirt and pants, which were literally drippng with sweat when I entered town, were almost miraculously transformed into dry, nice-smelling garments. I'm not sure I will ever take clean clothes for granted again.  Of course, all this freshness will last all of about an hour tomorrow.  After the laundry was done, Dory and Splat left to stay at the hiker pavilion at the end of town.  I am looking forward to a special treat tomorrow. Dapper Dan's fiancee, Bekka, is meeting me at the Eckville Shelter tomorrow evening, and she, Gravity, and I are going out to dinner.  She and Dapper are from this area, and she would like to meet me.  Dapper is already in New York, but we keep track of each other.  It's amazing to think back on that very first night on the trail, over three months ago, when we first met while he was setting up his tent.  Dapper, Alex, Space Jam, Billy, and Reed were the first group I hiked with, and I love to keep up with their progress.  I am deeply touched that Bekka told me that they consider me their trail dad. If everything goes according to plan, it won't be too long before they, Juan Gone, Monty, Leapfrog and Extra Mile, Gravity, Dory and Splat, and I, along with other friends I have met and have yet to meet, will be summiting Katahdin, and the hiking part of this journey will end. I am so happy to know that I will, in some small way, remain involved with my new friends as they continue their life journeys after the trail.  This, for me, may be the best Trail Magic of all.","Unnamed Campsite at Mile 1206.2

I slept well last night and was on the trail by 7:45.  I took a photo of the Port Clinton Hotel with the sun in a more supportive position and then headed out of town.  There was a very steep ascent out of town, but it was not nearly as severe as the descent was yesterday.  After I got to the top of the ridge, the trail was the now the familiar mix of difficulty levels that has defined central Pennsylvania.  I encountered two very impressive outlooks today.  The first was Pulpit Rock, where I enjoyed the view with Dory, Splat, and Simple.  From there, I walked a few hundred feet off trail and discovered the Pulpit Rock Astrological Park. Once again, the AT produces interesting, unexpected places to explore, and I spent some time walking among the buildings before settling against a tree on the freshly mowed grass to take my afternoon siesta.  I wasn't the only one who decided to take advantage of the Astrological Park's fresh, green grass to take a nap.  Dory and Splat joined me and napped a while longer than I did.  I left while they were both still asleep.  Of course, they both caught up with me soon, and I hiked awhile with Splat.  We had a wonderful conversation about all kinds of issues, and I told her one of my favorite quotes, ""Hope is a verb with its sleeves rolled up.""  We came to the other spectacular view of the day at Pinnacle Rock and spent time soaking in the view and taking photos. It was here that I met Debi and her daughter, Rachel. I also met Porsche and Bentley.  I have a soft spot in my heart for Yorkies, because we had a very special rescue dog named Roxie for ten years.  She was a special member of our family and lived to be almost eighteen years old.  Like all Yorkies, Porsche and Bentley are indescribably cute. I left Pinnacle Rock fully expecting the now predictable mix of trail conditions for the final five miles to my intended destination. I was surprised to discover that these last miles of the day followed an old roadbed and proved to be some of the easiest hiking I have had the entire trip.  I love the unpredictability of the Pennsylvania AT. I arrived at the Eckville Shelter around 5:00 and set up my tent.  Bekka, Dapper Dan's fiancee, was unexpectedly delayed by their dog becoming ill, but she made it as soon as she could.  Bekka is a lively, boisterous young woman, and we had a great time driving to the Wal-Mart in Hamburg for resupply.  Bekka actively participated and gave me some good ideas on some new foods to try.  As always, however, I was on the lookout for my old lunch standby, Spam Singles.  It may be hard to believe, but not all Wal-Marts carry Spam Singles.  This particular Wal-Mart surpassed my wildest dreams by not only having Spam Singles, but having an entire display of my favorite luncheon delicacy.  Bekka recorded the moment by taking my picture alongside the display.  There is no trash receptacle at the shelter, so Bekka also helped us shed the excess packaging while still at Wal-Mart.  We then headed for McDonald's for a late supper, before returning to the campsite. We must have passed a dozen deer beside the road to and from Hamburg. Fortunately,  they all decided to stay off of the road.  We soon arrived back at camp and said goodby for now to Bekka. Thank you, Bekka, for the great Trail Magic, and I know we will be keeping in touch with each other in the future.  I then headed for bed. I'll sort the food into my food sack tomorrow.  I purchased enough food to get me to Delaware Water Gap and into New Jersey.  It's hard to believe I  soon be in another state.","Port Clinton, PA

Despite getting to bed very late last night after our trip with Bekka, I still got up at 6:10 this morning.  I sorted my food and packed it in my food bag, broke down camp, and was on the trail by 8:45.  There was a very steep ascent out of Eckville to a ridgeline I would then follow for miles. The morning was quite warm and humid, and I was soaked with sweat long before I reached the summit at Dan's Pulpit.  There is a trail register there, and I saw that Monty passed through three days earlier. He left a long message, but it was in French, so I was unable to decipher it. The trail was extremely rocky through Dan's Pulpit and for several miles after that.  About five miles into my hike, I came across a blue blaze painted on a large rock with a sign on a tree above that read, ""Balance Rock.""  I was hot, sweaty, and tired and decided to pass by the side trail without exploration. Then I stopped. I have been checking out all of the side trips I can, so I returned to the blue blaze, found a nice, comfortable rock, balled my hat up under my head, and took a nap. Refreshed after my twenty minute snooze, I climbed over the rock pile to see what Balanced Rock was all about. I scrambled over the ridge to find three large boulders stacked up together, balanced upon one another.  The bottom boulder stuck out further than the others, and the word, ""Lift,"" was painted on the protrusion.  Always up for a challenge, I walked/crawled out to it and gave it a go.  Unfortunately, there was no one there to record my Herculean effort, but to no one's surprise, the tons of rock refused to budge.  There was no good angle to get a photo of the ""balanced"" rocks, but I did the best I could and returned to the trail. Much refreshed from my nap, I continued on through more very rocky terrain.  I thought that perhaps I had arrived at the continuous rockiness, but then the trail smoothed out as it had yesterday, and I found myself hiking along an old roadway again.  I hiked awhile with Scribbles, who is recovering from a bout with Lyme disease.  We stopped at the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter for lunch.  It was here that I finally met Molotov, who, coincidentally, is also recovering from Lyme. Molotov became a bit of a legend his second night on the trail when he was attempting to light his alcohol stove while in the second story area of a two story shelter, and accidentally ignited his fuel bottle instead.  Reacting quickly, he threw the flaming bottle, where it landed amongst the numerous hikers preparing for bed on the lower level of the shelter.  Fortunately, no one was injured and no property went up in flames.  Molotov told me he no longer uses an alcohol stove, although, in all fairness, they are perfectly safe if used properly. I ate lunch and immediately returned to the trail. I guess one nap per day is proving sufficient. As I was getting water from a nearby stream, it began to rain.  As I've stated before, I enjoy a good rain, and continued along feeling quite rejuvenated. A thunderstorm ensued, and, while it rained very hard for awhile, the lightening never got closer than two miles to me.  I hike pretty fast in the rain, and soon arrived at PA 309, where the Blue Mountain Summit Bed and Breakfast/Restaurant is located. Dory and Splat suggested this morning that we meet there for dinner, and who am I to turn down a suggestion for yummy, high calorie food that hasn't been toted on my back.  I was pretty much soaked, but I left my pack on the porch and went inside.  Dory and Splat were at a table with Tyedye, and I joined them. I enjoyed an excellent cheeseburger (mozzarella with all possible toppings) and fries. In deference to the weather, I ordered a locally brewed Stout, which was also excellent. Dory and Splat had gotten a room for the night, but I felt like hiking on.  I was less than two miles from my intended campsite, so I was soon back on my way.  It was still raining steadily, but no more thunderstorms. I was headed for the New Tripoli Campsite, which is located down a very steep 0.2 mile side trail off the AT, just past a large power line cut.  Immediately before the power lines, I found a good looking campsite right off the trail.  I contined past the power lines, but when I saw the steepness of the side trail, I decided to set up camp in the site I had seen before.  That is, until I took a closer look.  That site would have provided little protection against wind in the event we have another storm tonight, and I counted at least six dead trees standing among the site.  After reconsidering, I returned to the access trail to the New Tripoli Campsite and hiked down to it, where I found a wonderful clearing near a little stream.  i quickly set up my tent in a steady rain.  Dead trees, or widow-makers as they are often called, should not be overlooked.  A soft, windless rain continues to fall as I write this. In the past thirty minutes, I have heard two large branches and one entire tree fall in the woods.  There are no dead trees near my tent, so I am as safe as I can be. Tomorrow morning, I will be facing the Knife Edge, an exposed, rocky scramble along a ridgeline.  I am only about fifty miles from Delaware Water Gap and the end of Pennsylvania, so I am expecting the intense rock work to begin tomorrow.  After that, I'll be in New Jersey, my next state on the trail to Maine.","Eckville Shelter Tent Site

I woke up at 6:00 to the sound of steady rain on my tent.  I delayed getting up and didn't start moving until about 6:30. Gravity told me that  rain and thunderstorms were in the forecast all day, and he was concerned about crossing the Knife Edge in the rain. The Knife Edge, as I mentioned before, is an exposed, rocky ridge that is reportedly quite challenging to cross.  I suppose the name, Knife Edge, says it all. It is not recommended to cross it in inclement weather.   Also, Gravity's ankle has him concerned, and he decided to take a zero today to rest his ankle and to await better weather.  I decided to stay as well.  Fortunately, I continue to feel great, but a day of rest certainly wouldn't hurt me either.  It rained all morning, and a strong thunderstorm moved through about 1:00.  I heard three more large branches fall from trees. I spent the day listening to Watership Down on my mp3 player.  It is one of my favorite Richard Adams books, and the first one of his books that I read.  It tells the tale of a group of rabbits, their warren destroyed by poison to make room for a new subdivision, and their epic quest to find a new home.  It is fantastically imaginative, and, although Adams denies any attempt at allegory, makes strong statements about different types of political systems.  Please don't let that frighten you away if you are considering reading Watership Down, as it is first and foremost a great adventure with many wonderful and memorable characters.  When choosing a tale of an epic quest for my mp3 player for times when I wanted to visit with old, literary friends, such as today, I immediately chose this tale of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and the other rabbits trying to find a home.  Listening to it read by Adams is an added bonus.  I also dozed for several hours, so I'm thinking a day of rest was in order.  The few other zeros I have taken on the trail, with the single exception of the other time I zeroed in my tent due to inclement weather, I have kept myself busy with other things and haven't taken time to rest.  I'm in no way been bored, but am l looking forward to getting back on the trail tomorrow.  I got out of my tent around 5:00 this evening and cooked a leisurely dinner. I heard from my friend, Monty, today.  I've been following him via notes he leaves in journals, and he is three to four days ahead of me.  I just mentioned today that I wish I had a way to contact him, and he got in touch through my web journal.  It was great hearing from him.  I'm headed for an early bedtime, so I will be plenty rested as I aim for Delaware Water Gap in three days. It's supposed to be sunny and not too warm tomorrow as I get back on the trail, so I should be able to make as good progress as possible through the heart of Rocksylvania.","New Tripoli Campsite

I awoke well rested and refreshed after my day off from hiking. Today is day number 100 since I began the trail. I didn't know it this morning, but I was about to begin what would turn out to be my most challenging day on the trail so far.  I was on the trail by 7:30 and soon reached the Knife Edge.  It was a slow, rocky scramble across large boulders perched across the ridgeline. The going was quite slow, and a serious slip could have had very bad consequences as the fall off from either side was quite steep.  I slipped and fell twice, but was able to catch myself with no harm done.  It was mentally and well as physically challenging, because you were repeatedly required to figure out how to negotiate the jumble of rock faces and boulders as you headed from one white blaze toward the next.  When one could look up, the views were often spectacular. While difficult, I find experiences like the Knife Edge an exciting change of pace from regular hiking. The Knife Edge ended after perhaps a half mile, and the trail became easier.  The sun was shining, and I passed a beautiful spider web lit up by the sun. It was shaped like a ball and very impressive. I also came across a large black snake crossing the trail in front of me. A bit further on, I reached down to pick up what I thought was a piece of cellephane trash, only to discover I just smeared my hand through slug slime.  Oh well, that's one of the reasons for hand sanitizer.  I continued along the trail headed for my next challenge at Bake Oven Knob, when I passed a southbound hiker.  Before I could say anything, he grinned really big, stuck out his hand, and said, ""Hi! You must be Stick in the Woods!""  A bit surprised, I acknowledged that I was and inquired how he knew me.  This is how I met Hoosier, who has been following me on my journal.  An avid hiker and mountain climber, Hoosier, who does not live in Indiana (no mountains there), planned a day hike today so he could meet me.  He is the first hiker I have met who knew me from my journal.  We chatted a bit, and he warned me about the descent from Bake Oven Knob, which he said was every bit as dangerous and challenging as the Knife Edge, and that the rocks were particularly slick.  After reaching Bake Oven Knob and enjoying the view, I gratefully heeded his advice and found it accurate indeed.  The rocks were again large, jumbled, and covered with a slick lichen.  I remember an account of this area from an article I read years ago.  The author warned that Pennsylvania was where boots go to die as you scramble over thousands of boulders that range in size from your head to small Buicks.  I was finally experiencing this first hand.  The trail did improve as I headed for Bake Oven Knob Shelter  and lunch.  Hoosier caught up with me from his out and back hike, and we talked some more. He has summited all thirty-five 3,500 foot peaks in the Catskills, and over twenty of the 4,000 foot peaks in New Hampshire.  His goal is to reach the top of all 115 major mountains in the New England area.  He has also hiked extensively in the west and really prefers hiking in winter.  He told me he has hiked the Knife Edge in winter and added that one summer there was a hornets nest in one of the trees that added extra excitement. It was fun to meet him, and I greatly appreciate him taking the effort to meet me.  I filled up with water at the spring at the shelter because water can be in short supply in this area.  Gravity noted that Pennsylvania trail was like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, sometimes quite wonderful and other times not so much.  The trail out of Bake Oven Knob Shelter was for the most part good, and I began to make good time.  It took me five hours to travel the first five miles today,  but I kept up a nice pace for the next several miles.  I came across some wild blueberries and sampled several. They were quite tasty. I soon passed the next shelter and stopped at the spring near to it. I was approaching the Palmerton Zinc Pile Superfund Site, and suitable water would be particularly scarce.  I added an extra liter to my usual amount. About a half mile later, I was crossing the Lehigh River on the PA 873 bridge.  I always enjoy the excitement and change of pace when arriving in an urban area. I knew there would be a steep, rocky climb out of the Lehigh River Valley and got my first look at what was coming up as I crossed the river.  The mountain loomed in front of me, and I could see the large, open rock face that made up a good percentage of its side and summit.  I hiked alongside the busy road to cross the highway at a stop light to get back to the AT.  I was struck with an interesting oxymoron. The white blazes indicated that I needed to cross at the light, but there was a large No Walking sign above the blaze.  As before, I settled the conundrum by running across the busy road.  I was soon back in the woods and was hiking up a very steep slope when I encountered my big surprise for the day.  When my guidebook informs me that the AT was relocated due to the Superfund clean up and warns of ""Rocky, steep trail,"" I should really pay attention.   It took me two hours to cover less than a mile as I was again scrambling up a very steep rock face (the same one I saw from below crossing the river). I was often on my hands and knees and several times had to toss my trekking poles ahead to keep both hands free. One several occasions I was perched on a rock face unable to move up or forward until I could decipher the puzzle and figure out how to proceed. All this with a heavier than usual pack due to my extra water.  It was really quite exhilarating, although I will be honest and admit that I was not disappointed when I finally reached the top and returned to more normal trail.  The views back down to the river, highways, and buildings were really quite something to see, when one could look up from the job at hand to appreciate them.  Dr. Jekyll returned with several miles of easy trail, and I again had hope that I could reach my planned campsite before dark.  There are few suitable camping possibilities in this area, and the one I was headed for was 3.4 miles past the ascent.  The blueberries were replaced with many bushes full of colorful, red raspberries.  The ecological work in this area has really reaped rewards,  since a few years ago the area was completely devoid of vegetation due to nearly a century of zinc production. It is still recommended not to drink water from the single small stream that runs through the area, but I did risk eating a few raspberries as I hiked along. I could see a large factory complex below me as I walked along the ridge. I don't know if it was responsible for the damage to the area or another factory altogether, but it was impressive in its own right.   The AT remained true to form by becoming very rocky and difficult a half mile from the campsite.  While I feel like I am really taking Rocksylvania in stride, I have to admit I did say a few unflattering, and even disparaging, things about my favorite trail as I struggled to reach the campsite by dark.  I arrived at 8:25, and had time to string the bear rope and set up my tent before sundown. I was preparing dinner by the light of my headlamp when Gravity arrived.  I was in bed by 10:15.  We covered 16.3 very challenging and memorable miles today, and, while I do feel a little more beat up than I usually do at the end of the day, I am confident I'll be ready for whatever the Pennsylvania AT chooses to dish out, whether it be Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, or a combination of both.","New Tripoli Campsite

First of all, Happy Anniversary to my wonderful wife of thirty-four years, Sandy.  I miss you, and I so much appreciate your love and support over all these years, as well as your support for this crazy venture I have chosen to undertake.  It will be over in a few months, but our crazy venture will continue, hopefully, for many more years to come.  I woke up this morning feeling fine.  It amazes me how my body recovers every night to be ready to have another go at a long walk the next day.  The goal for today was a campsite 14.7 miles away.  Having no idea how challenging the trail would be, I was hiking before 8:00.  Mr. Hyde held the day for the first mile.  There was a very steep, very rocky ascent out of Little Gap, and it took me over an hour to complete the first mile.  I was a little concerned over my water situation but felt confident I had enough to get me to the spring at the next shelter.  Dr. Jekyll made a welcome appearance, however, and the next several miles went by quite nicely.  Granted, there were some very rocky patches, but the trail mostly consisted of relatively clear areasand areas that required disjointed jitterbugging.  I recalled an old nursery rhyme my mom used to recite that helps sum up Pennsylvania trail:
There once was a little girlWho had a little curl Right in the middle of her forehead.When she was good,She was very, very good,But when she was bad she was horrid.
Pennsylvania is home to a great deal of good trail, but when she decides to dish out the bad, it's with several exclamation points.  I got to Smith Gap Road before noon, with only about six more miles to go for the day.  I decided to make a side trip to see if I could meet Mechanical Man, who lives a mile down the road.  I stashed my pack and walked down a steep, paved road, following the blue blazes painted on telephone poles. Mechanical Man is a friend to hikers and allows them access to his water faucet at any time, as well as providing a hostel in his garage, sodas, fuel, and shuttling.  He is a section hiker who lacks only the section from Springer Mountain to Hot Springs to be done.  He is one of the AT personalities I hoped to meet. He wasn't home when I arrived, so I gave him a call. He told me to make myself at home, and he would be back shortly from shuttling some hikers.  I settled in by drinking several liters of water, leaning against the dome addition to his home, and watching the bees and hummingbirds feed on the riotously red flowers that surround his home. I tried to photograph the hummingbirds, but they would have none of it. I was able to reach Sandy on the phone to wish her a happy anniversary.  Mechanical Man soon arrived, and we had a good chat.  He has met and assisted many hikers, including Earl Schafer.  He shared photos of himself with many other AT notables, such as Ed Garvey. His son is an accomplished guitarist who plays in a band called Mojo, and I enjoyed watching videos of the band play Stairway to Heaven, Simple Man, and some other classic rock favorites. Then, Mechanical Man asked if I was familiar with the group, Heart, and played the song I have teased Sandy about for years, saying it is her theme song for me: Crazy on You.  Happy Anniversary, Honey!  I also purchased enough denatured alcohol to fill my fuel bottle for a dollar.  For another dollar, I decided to buy a soda.  Mechanical Man has a selection of bottled Cokes, the ones with names on them, and I shouldn't have been surprised when the one front and center was labeled Sandra. I obviously purchased it.  Again, Happy Anniversary, Sweetheart.  I visited with Mechanical Man and his Doberman, Guinness, for over an hour.  He then gave me a ride back to the trail. I thanked him again and headed back out.  I felt rejuvenated and made pretty good time to the next shelter.  The water was from a spring nearly a half mile down a steep trail, so I stashed my pack, got out my water filtering kit, and headed down the side trail. Hikers tend to look out for each other, and I had gone only about two tenths of a mile when I saw the words, H2O, spelled out in rocks on the trail along with an arrow pointing left.  Sure enough, there was a small, natural box spring that was perfect for filling my bottles.  Thanks to the unknown hiker who saved me the rest of that long walk for water.  I was pleasantly surprised to meet Pippi at the spring, and we had a great time catching up with each other.  I told her about the upcoming Bear Summoner video, since she played such a central role by requesting a Bear Blessing.  Pippi is another wonderful soul I have met on this journey.  I was soon back on the trail, where I met a southbound day hiker from the area, who warned me that the rock situation was very bad from just past this shelter and for the next twenty miles to Delaware Water Gap.  Sure enough, it appears Dr. Jekyll has turned things over to Mr. Hyde,  and the little curly headed girl has decided to be horrid.  I took my time and did the best I could.  Rocksylvania is part of AT lore, and all thru hikers must pass through.  I guess final impressions tend to be lasting, and jutting, pointy, painful rocks are the finale for PA.  However, I won't forget the enjoyable trail and the challenging rock scrambles that also comprise the AT here.  Pippi soon caught up with me, and we traded stories for several miles before she headed past me on her way to an outlook she wanted to check out.  She uses a hammock, which affords her much more freedom in where to camp.  Basically, all she needs are two trees.  I soon came to my intended campsite, which was large, open, and, most importantly, flat. I arrived at 6:30 and soon had camp set up.  I was cooking dinner when Gravity arrived. I made it to bed early, as tomorrow's agenda includes a 16.7 mile walk amongst Mr. Hyde's trail all the way to Delaware Water Gap.  The day after tomorrow, I should find myself clean, resupplied, and in New Jersey.","Unnamed Campsite at 1262.2

Note: I have uploaded all my photos up to Delaware Water Gap. 
I got up a little early this morning, because I knew I had a long day of uncertain trail and wanted to get to Delaware Water Gap as early as possible.  I also was a bit concerned about the water situation, since the last water source was at the shelter yesterday.  While I did tote an extra liter, we had a dry camp last night, which uses water.  Also, I always start the morning by drinking a liter of water if there is a source, and that was not possible this morning.  I had a bit over a liter and a half to get to the next source at Kirkridge Shelter, 10.3 miles away.  I wanted to hike as much as I could as early as I could, before the heat of the day. I did decide to take a photo of all of my equipment before stowing it in my pack.  I'll not list equipment here.  If you are interested, I did fill out the gear section of this journal, and I have made few changes.  It's easy to see how hikers attain the trail name, Yard Sale, if they spread their stuff out early in their hike.  I've known two Yard Sales.  I was off before 7:30 and faced several miles of challenging, rocky trail.  There was also a quite steep ascent out of Wind Gap, and I scarcely covered a single mile in the first hour.  The trail improved somewhat after that, as I worked my way toward the shelter.  There was some extra tricky boulder scrambling at Wolf Rocks, and I got a special treat at the top.  Actually, two treats, as I found Red Eye already there looking at a very unconcerned buzzard who was surveying his domain from the summit.  Red Eye hoped to see him fly, but he wasn't in any hurry to comply.  After Wolf Rocks, I was pleasantly surprised that the trail improves tremendously, as Dr. Jekyll paid a house call.  I had been told that there were rock fields all the way to Delaware Water Gap, but hiked over a mile on pretty decent trail. I was glad, because of my water situation.  I made it to the shelter moderately hydrated and with a little water left, but I was beginning to fantasize about Gatorade and waterfalls.  Unlimited amounts of clean, readily available drinking water is something we very much take for granted.  I made it to the shelter and drank one liter of water and mixed up a liter of Propel and drank it on the spot.  I filled all of my available bottles and played the ""I can get a drink as often as I want"" game for the remaining 6.4 miles to Delaware Water Gap.  Childish, perhaps, but it helped me continue to hydrate and also helped when the trail was rugged.  However, the trail again followed an old road for two of those miles, which made for easy hiking. I guess it is human nature to remember the difficult and challenging times at the expense of the good times, but, in all fairness to Pennsylvania, there was never a day when there wasn't some easy hiking to go with all the rocks.  Soon after leaving the shelter after lunch, I saw something bright red through the trees.  Thank you again, AT, for giving me another unexpected experience. A man with a hang glider (perhaps a hang gliderist?) was perched on a high grassy area preparing for take off.  I set down my pack and sat down to watch.  He waited about ten minutes until the wind was just right and took off.  He immediately disappeared from sight as he veered to the left, but I saw him soaring high overhead several times.  As cool as it would have been to watch that buzzard become airborne, I think the hang gliderist more than made up for that.  I made good progress toward Delaware Water Gap as clouds began to gather and thunder started to grumble. I took a photo of the Delaware River from an outlook just before the storm began. I was into the descent into the valley, with 1.5 miles to go to town, when the storm hit. The thunder was loud and the lightening bright, but believe it or not, the sun continued to shine during the entire storm. The sunlight reflecting on the streams of rain was particularly beautiful.  I thought about all I have written lately about the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character of the Pennsylvania AT, and I like to think that both gentleman turned out to say goodbye to me as I leave their state tomorrow.  Of course, rocks pay little attention to political boundaries, and it is reported that the first twenty or so miles into New Jersey are equally as rocky.  I made it to Delaware Water Gap at around 6:00 and headed for the Church of the Mountain Hiker Center.  Run as a mission of the church, the hiker center is supported by donations.  Rather than stay in the hostel, I opted to tent in the yard.  Also immediately after arrival, the power went out in the entire town.  I took a nice, hot shower in the dark and prepared to go into town for food.  It was rumored that the pizza place uses gas ovens, so I headed that way.  I met Rooster, a fellow thru hiker along the way. The rumor was true, and I enjoyed a mushroom pizza and a beer.  The power came back on while I was there.  Gravity showed up, and he had also landed at the Hiker Center.  Of the four big things: Shower, Laundry, Resupply, and Food, I've only completed the first and the last.  Jerry, a member of the church, said he will be running a shuttle to Wal-Mart in the morning at 7:30.  That takes care of resupply, and I hope to find a laundromat. I still plan on hiking tomorrow and am presently 0.3 miles from the New Jersey line. I couldn't help from feeling somewhat nostalgic today as I prepare to leave Pennsylvania. New Jersey will be my eighth state, and the first one I have never visited before.  Hopefully, I will start my New Jersey adventure with clean clothes.  And if not, I know there is a laundromat soon to be in my future.","Unnamed Campsite at Mile 1276.9

There was no way to resupply last night, so before going out to eat last night I talked to Kenny (aka Ole Dawg), a member of the church who is indispensable to hikers as a shuttler. He said he could be at the church at 7:30 in the morning to take us to Wal-Mart. I got up early realizing I would need to take getting my laundry done literally into my own hands.  The hostel supplied two buckets, detergent, and a hose, and I got to work.  I was able to get my hiking clothes washed and hung on a drying rack and have the rest of my equipment packed before Kenny showed up right on time.  He dropped us off and went to have a tire checked.  Gravity and I resupplied and were ordering breakfast at Burger King when he got back and then returned us to the hostel. Thanks, Ole Dawg, for being such a friendly, helpful man.  We planned on a ten mile day today, so we took out time sorting food and finishing packing. My clothes were pretty much dry when I changed into them.  We started out of town, but I realized no visit to Delaware Water Gap could be considered complete without a trip to Zoe's Ice Cream Emporium. Proudly displaying a large, wire squirrel eating an ice cream cone, Zoe's is an old fashioned ice cream parlor that not only captures the atmosphere perfectly, but also serves great food and unbelievably good ice cream.  I had the ""Ever Popular"" Dreamsicle Milkshake, and, believe me, there is a reason it is ever popular.  After enjoying our frozen treats, it was finally time to leave town.  Crossing the Delaware River on the I-80 Bridge was very exciting. Halfway across the bridge, painted on the sidewalk, is a sign denoting the border between Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  We paused for photographs and I set a bit of Beau free above the river, as cars and trucks roared by a few feet away.  After crossing into New Jersey, I made a brief stop at the Kittatinny Visitor Center before heading back into the woods.  I had a five mile hike along pretty rocky trail to Sunfish Lake, one of the seven natural wonders of New Jersey. This forty-one acre lake was carved out by the same glacier that deposited the millions of rocks I have been traveling through when it melted all those thousands of years ago.  It is a beautiful gem of a lake, high up the mountain.  I paused at a comfortable looking rock pile for lunch and a nap.  Working my way along the shore of Sunfish Lake consisted of scrambling over boulders and walking through rock fields.  In fact, most of the rest of the day's hike, five miles to the Mohican Outdoor Center, was what I had been warned that Pennsylvania would be like.  Dr. Jekyll stayed home in PA, but Mr. Hyde caught the train to New Jersey.  There was no let up in the rocky trail, but I made okay time and got to the center about 7:30.  Along the way, I hiked over the summit of Kittatinny Mountain and was rewarded with quite a view. Simple and Uncle Heather arrived at the summit at the same time, and we took photos for each other.  I met Uncle Heather at the hostel last night.  One of her reasons for hiking the trail is to raise awareness for the need for more diversity both on and off the trail. She said hiking has been a great confidence builder and plans on hiking the other two major trails to complete the Triple Crown.  We had a wonderful talk about the challenges of hiking the trail, as well as the extra challenges she faces. I plan on keeping track of her journey as she completes the Triple Crown. As for me, I continue to love hiking the AT, but it will be a one and done for me.  I called Sandy this morning to wish her a happy birthday, and I have no plans to be separated from her for any more long periods of time.  Happy Birthday, Sandy!  I got to the Center after it closed, but was able to chat with a group of young people from a youth adventure camp before heading to the tent area to make camp. Gravity soon arrived and we had an uneventful few minutes before darkness and bedtime set in. We will probably be in the trail before the Center opens in the morning. My understanding is there are about twenty-five more miles of rocks to go.  Crater Lake is on the agenda for tomorrow, so I'll be able to observe a lake caused by a different force of nature. Time to go back to sleep now so I'll be ready to rock on in New Jersey tomorrow.","Delaware Water Gap/Church of the Mountain Hiker Center

Hours of operation for the camp store at the Mohican Outdoor Center are 8:30 am to 7:00 pm.  I arrived after closing time last night and left before opening time today.  I didn't need any supplies and wanted to get a jump on the day, which looked to be another hot one. Owned by the Appalachian Mountain Club, the Mohican Outdoor Center caters to campers as well as hikers.  An unwritten etiquette exists among thru hikers, and most shelter areas are dead quiet by ""Hiker Midnight,"" which is around 9:00 pm.  It didn't bother me since I am such a light sleeper anyway, but there were people loudly talking and laughing until 1:00 am last night.  My favorite anecdote was of three campers who were walking along the trail near my tent a bit after midnight.  As they approached my tent, I heard one of them caution the others to be quiet. They crept by my tent, only to resume their high volume conversation about ten feet past me.  When we were packing up this morning, Gravity suggested loudly clanging shut the door to the bear box, but, of course, we didn't.  It's not so much the other campers were rude, it's just they were operating under a different set of social expectations that didn't include hiking long hours in the heat the next day.  As it was, we were on the trail by 8:20.  The trail conditions began where yesterday's left off, with lots of rocks.  I made slow progress the first few hours.  I took a short walk along the Rattlesnake Swamp trail and was rewarded with a nice view of the valley below.  I proceeded to the Catfish Lookout Tower, the first one I have seen in a long time.  I climbed as high as I could, as the observation deck was closed.  The view was rather mundane, but I then remembered that such structures were built with the idea of preventing forest fires and not with providing hikers with picturesque views.  The trail notably improved for a few miles to the point that I decided Dr. Jekyll had finally gotten the memo and arrived.  I paused at a stream just three miles into the day to top off my bottles and to drink an extra liter. The heat was already an issue, so I was taking no chances with my water supply. I met Mark at the spring.  Mark (no trail name yet) recently began a thru hike from Harpers Ferry. He is doing a flip-flop hike by first hiking to Katahdin, transporting back to Harpers Ferry, and then hiking southbound to Springer Mountain.  He told me he had hiked a few days with his son, who is presently hiking traditionally northbound, over the Memorial Day weekend and had a great time. For Father's Day, his son gifted him with equipment, and he began his own thru hike.  From Mark, I learned of my latest near miss in the bear sighting department, to add to my litany of near misses. Mark told me that at about 8:30 this morning he was returning to his campsite along the same trail I had used at 8:15 to return to the AT, when he saw a bear passing through the camping area. When I informed him that I have yet to see a bear, he told me that his son, who is presently a few weeks ahead in Connecticut, has seen eighteen.  It may come as a surprise that the most likely place for an AT hiker to see a bear is in New Jersey, so you never know, I might finally get lucky.  I didn't see any bears, but I did see three black snakes and a turtle. The snakes were all in a hurry, but the turtle simply stared back at me when I offered to take its photo.  I'm not sure what kind it is, but it did turn like it planned on following me when I left it to return to hiking. The trail remained pretty good for the most part as I next walked past a large swamp, complete with frogs lily pads, and a swampy odor.  I'm sure it doesn't smell much worse than I do after hiking for two very warm days in clothes that were last washed in a bucket. Mr. Hyde made his return in good time, but there were perhaps three miles of easy trail and several miles of disjointed jitterbug trail today. I was jitterbugging when I passed alongside Crater Lake early this afternoon.  I took a short side trail down to it to get a closer look.  It is a pretty lake, and I accidentally scared a frog who quickly jumped back into the lake.  I quickly returned to the task at hand and hiked the last five miles to the Brink Shelter tenting area.  It appeared that Dr. Jekyll was busy on a house call, because the trail for the rest of the day was quite rocky.  I got to camp at 6:30 and visited with other hikers as I completed my evening camp chores and then prepared to go to bed. I am laying in my tent right now being lulled by the sounds of a lightly snoring hiker (Gravity) and a chorus of bullfrogs from a nearby swampy area. It's past hiker midnight, and all is right with the AT world.","Camp Road/Mohican Outdoor Center

I slept well as usual and woke up a bit after six.  There was a group of three young hikers I ate dinner with last night, and they were up at the same time.  They were on the trail about thirty minutes later.  I don't know how they do it, as it takes me a little over an hour and a half from the time I start moving to the time I start walking.  Upon completing the last step of my pre-hike preparation at the privy, I met Brad, who was waiting patiently outside.  I've actually spoken with him and his hiking partner for a few days now as they pass me on the trail.  I get an earlier start than they do, but they hike faster than I do.  It was a very nice privy, which initiated the conversation (roomy, clean privies have a way of doing this).  Brad, who does not have an individual trail name, told me that he and his wife were thru hiking as their honeymoon. Later, as he and Nicholette passed me on the trail, I got a chance to talk with ""The Honeymooners.""  They met at an outdoors store in Gatlinburg and hiked together for three years before getting married on March 25th and then hitting the trail to celebrate.  They share the joint trail name, ""The Honeymooners,"" as they this adventure together. I told them that Sandy and I also went camping for our honeymoon thirty-four years ago, but that out camping/floating adventure was for a week, not for six months.  I got a bit nostalgic and related how I had nonchalantly laid my head back as our canoe slid under a toppled tree on the river,  only to have the canoe get stuck with my head as the plug. Fortunately, a couple of college kids came along a very long ten minutes later, disembarked from their canoe, and pushed our canoe backwards to free my head. I was fine except for some bruising on my neck. Sandy was thus saved from becoming an early widow, and I was saved from being a potential Darwin Award recipient. I concluded my story with the added bit that, due to this misadventure, I added another item to my bucket list. No matter how I end up dying, I don't want people to read about it in the newspaper, shake their heads, and say, ""What a dumbsh*t."" A man needs to have standards, after all.  The Honeymooners told me they wanted to share this adventure together before they settled into more normal married responsibilities like careers and children.  Being a very proud dad, I told them that having children was the greatest adventure of all and that they would certainly be great parents.  We then parted ways because we all had miles to cover.  A short time later, I came across them again where the AT crosses Culvers Gap at US 206. Unfortunately,  the restaurant up the road wouldn't open for several more hours,  so we all hiked on.  I met up with Mark again, who told me some people were calling him Hobo, but he wasn't sure he liked the name. I replied that there was no sense in adopting a trail name if he didn't care for it. Mark had hitched into Branchville for breakfast and gave me a plum and some honey sticks. I saved a honey stick for Gravity, but the plum was all mine. Thank you, Mark, for the trail magic, and I'm sure you'll obtain a trail name you like. Mark is an older hiker like I am, and I hope to continue to see him on the trail.  A few miles further on, I came across the Culver Fire Tower and climbed it. The views were fine. I am much more at ease climbing such towers now than I was at the beginning of my hike, although they continue to make me a tad nervous. I stopped for water at a stream near Gren Anderson Shelter. The water retained a slight brownish tint even aftering filtering, but I read about this in my pre-hike preparation, and there is no health risk involved. I decided to press on to the pavilion atop Sunrise Mountain before I ate lunch.  This proved an excellent decision, as the pavilion is constructed of stone, including the floor, and was much cooler than the surrounding area. I met up with The Honeymooners, who were also eating lunch.  We were later joined by a group of three young hikers who entertained us by doing pull ups on the beams and making ""Sweat Angels"" on the stone floor.  These are like Snow Angels, only grosser.  I ate lunch and then took the best nap of the trip. Refreshed, I made pretty good time to Rutherford Shelter, which is reached by a 0.4 mile, rocky side trail. Perhaps because of this, I was the only one at the shelter when I arrived. It is in a compact area with a very pretty grassy area for tents.  I set up camp as thunder started rumbling in the distance.  A few minutes later, a thunderstorm blew in, which I weathered quite nicely in the overhang of the shelter. Just prior to the storm, I was joined by Arun, a very friendly man from New Jersey who is on his very first backpacking trip. In fact, tonight is his first night ever backpacking.  An avid trail runner, Arun and I shared ideas and stories about both endeavors. He will be hiking southbound tomorrow, but it was a privilege to be able to share his first ever backpacking evening with him. He may have even inspired me to try a little trail running when I get home.  Gravity, who was privileged to have to hike in the storm, arrived a bit later. He waited until the storm subsided before setting up his tent. The sky was a pretty blue with some fluffy clouds when I headed for bed before it got dark. This is part of the life of a thru hiker: getting excited about being in bed before dark.  The trail was still quite rocky today but with gradually extended periods of less rockiness.  Rumor has it that I will be through with the rocks soon.  It's been a challenge, but I will be glad to bid them farewell.  So will my feet and my shoes.","Brink Shelter Tent Site

I knew it would be a short day today, but I woke up at my regular time and was ready to hit the trail by 7:45. I said goodbye to Arun and headed back up the long side trail.  I was back on the AT a few minutes before 8:00 and headed for my first destination of the day, the High Point State Park Headquarters.  If the trail were supposed to be getting easier, it somehow missed the memo.  However, it didn't take me too long to cover the three miles.  The headquarters is in a handsome stone building on a beautiful lawn. Pippi and Radio were there when I arrived.  I went inside to claim my free soda, which is given every thru hiker, and to look around.  There was a stuffed bear toy sitting on a bench,  and Pippi insisted she take my picture with it. In good fun, I agreed. I had my first major ""costume malfunction"" of the trip after I used the restroom at the headquarters. The zipper on the fly of my hiking pants steadfastly refused to zip back up.  After several minutes of fruitless effort, I had to acknowledge the reality that it would zip no more.  The only option I had for the moment was to use one of the duckie diaper pins I use to hang my socks and skivies on the back of my pack every day to hold my fly together.  I must admit, it looked rather conspicuously ridiculous.  Gravity arrived and offered me a smaller, less attention-grabbing safety pin, which worked for the rest of the day.  I have decided to either pin or sew the zipper shut from the inside, since I have lost several inches off my waist in the past fifteen weeks of hiking, and the pants are loose enough to get by without a functioning zipper. With my trousers, if not my dignity, intact, I pressed on, ever northward.  There were a few areas of easier hiking over the next few miles, as I approached two different areas I wanted to explore.  The first, was a public beach with a food concession stand.  I hiked along the very rocky and bouldery side trail that hugged to lake side before realizing the road was a far easier option. Nonetheless, I finally made it to Little Lulu's and sat at a picnic table watching hundreds of New Jerseyans and their friends frolic in the lake and sun themselves on the beach. I lunched on a tasty cheeseburger and fries, finished off with a strawberry shortcake ice cream bar and a Gatorade.  I again met Pippi, who had already eaten, swam, and showered since we left the State Park Headquarters.  I remain amazed at how fast some of these young people can hike. There are numerous signs informing patrons that there are no trash receptacles at the beach, and that everyone is expected to pack out their own trash. Maria, the sweet lady at the concession stand, offered me her own trash can so I wouldn't have to find room in my pack for my lunch trash. A small gesture, perhaps, but it was greatly appreciated. I returned to the trail and immediately climbed the steep side trail to The Monument, a 220 foot stone structure that towers over the highest point in New Jersey. Built to honor veterans, it is a massive, impressive structure. I climbed the 291 steps to the top and admired the views from the windows. Once again, I have been treated with an unexpected discovery along the trail. I continued on, as the rocks slowly started to diminish. Soon I was hiking through boggy, swampy areas, aided by raised, wooden walkways.  The going was very hot and muggy, but much easier than rocks.  I began making much better time and soon crossed the Murray driveway, where a sign on the trail offered fresh well water to all hikers, ""100 Yards Ahead."" I had plenty of tepid water to make it to Unionville but decided to take the sign up on its offer. I encountered a nifty little building specifically built as a rest area for hikers alongside a spigot dispensing ice cold well water. Queen Bee and Jonesy were resting in the building, whose walls are adorned with maps and posters of the AT. They told me I had just missed meeting the owner of the property, a former thru hiker who built the facility to aid fellow hikers. With my bottles full, i quickly covered the rest of the trail to Unionville, which lies a half mile from the trail itself. Unionville offers free tenting behind the Village Office Building.  I quickly claimed my spot on the well-kept, grassy lawn and headed across the street to Annabele's Pizza, where I indulged in three huge slices of pizza, some potato rolls, and an ice tea. I then headed to Horler's Store to officially register that I was camping and picked up a Andes Ice Cream bar for good measure. I then sat on the store's front porch, called my mom, and uploaded photos. It was then off to Witt's End Tavern for some fun and fellowship with other hikers.  Pippi, Mechanic, Radio, and Gravity were already there, sitting at a table a distance from the bar. They told me that the bartender had very politely requested they leave the bar due to the ""hiker air"" that emanates from us. She gave them each a free beer and provided a charging station for our phones. We were later joined by Dozer, Umbrella Face, Pheasant Man, Boomer, and Red Eye. Lori, the bartender, even brought over the ""Smell Well"" jar, full of sample sizes of personal hygiene products. Hikers naturally become immune to all but the worst cases of our body odor (no more large quantities of breakfast bacon for this boy!), so we forget how we can come across to ""the great washed."" Everyone at the tavern was friendly and accepting. Lori, who is pregnant with her second child, told me she is carrying a little girl named Isabella Rose. I told her about my beautiful grandbaby in England named Rose Elizabeth and shared some pictures.  We all stayed at the tavern until long past ""Hiker Midnight,"" because we were having such a good time. We finally left and returned to tent city. Tomorrow will be another relatively short day to Vernon, New Jersey, a larger town where I plan to do a five day resupply and stay somewhere where I can hopefully remove, albeit temporarily, some of my hiker funk. For now, it's back to sleep to rest up for tomorrow's much less rocky trail.","Rutherford Shelter Tent Site

Even though I went to bed much later than usual last night, I still woke up at 6:15 this morning. Although the plan was for a short day of about twelve miles, we needed to get to town for resupply, so the earlier we got to Highway 94 the better. After packing up, I went back to Horler's Store and got an egg, cheese, and ham breakfast sandwich, which was first rate.  The gentleman who made my sandwich was wearing a Cardinal baseball shirt and we swapped a few Cardinal stories from our youth (watching Lou Brock steal bases, Bob Gibson pitch and hit homeruns, and the 1967 World Series, among others). It was fun meeting another Cardinal fan who remembered the team of the 1960s and early 1970s.  After breakfast, I got back on the trail. There was a short but steep ascent past town but then the trail was, for the most part, easy.  I soon arrived at the Wallkill Wildlife Reserve, a large swampy area that the trail skirts by following its perimeter.  It was here that I met Frisky, a ridge runner. He thru hiked last year and decided he hadn't had enough of the trail, so he applied to be a ridge runner. He told me that he was a college friend of Radio, who then showed up, almost on cue. Gravity also arrived, and we all visited for a bit before returning to our respective tasks. Frisky was southbound, talking to hikers and checking on the trail, while the rest of us continued north.  I climbed Pochuck Mountain, where the trail got steep and rocky, but not for long.  The trail was punctuated several times by steep ascents and descents today, which added a fun variety of conditions. I stopped for water on my way up the mountain by hiking a short, marked side trail to a vacant house in much need of repair with a functioning water faucet on the outside wall.  I don't know the arrangements, but somebody maintains electricity to this house so that water is available.  My thanks to whoever is responsible.  I ate lunch on a log near the top of Pochuck and took my afternoon siesta there.  It turned out to be another hot day.  Refreshed, I hiked down the other side of the mountain and encountered the New Jersey Boardwalk that runs for nearly a mile across the swamp near the Pochuck River. While not the same boardwalk that Bruce Springsteen sings about in ""Sandy,"" it is quite an impressive structure. About four feet wide, it meanders its way across the swamp to the Pochuck River, which it crosses via a suspension bridge. Shortly after completIng the boardwalk, I arrived at Highway 94. The plan was to wait here for Gravity and then find a way to get to Warwick, where there were hotel rooms available, as well as laundry and a grocery store. As I  arrived at the parking lot, a very friendly woman immediately offered me a cold bottled water and asked me my plans. Thus I met Miss Melissa, who provides wonderful Trail Magic, but refuses to be called a Trail Angel (""Nothing much angelic about me""). I told her about the plan to get to Warwick, and she offered to drive us there when Gravity arrived.  She then told me that it might be a better plan to let her take us to Vernon for resupply and come stay for free at her house, where she had a washing machine and a pan of baked ziti ready to put in the oven. Melissa told me she has been caring for hikers this way for fifteen years because the world needs more kindness.  Gravity arrived, and we piled into Melissa's minivan and headed for the Acme Grocery Store in Vernon. It was then off to her beautiful condo, where we showered and got ready for dinner.  Melissa said she had clothes for us to wear while our hiking clothes were in the wash. I was offered a pair of New York Yankee sweat pants and a limited edition t-shirt commemorating the final year of old Yankee Stadium, ""The House that Ruth Built.""  In return for her kindness, I am presently decked out from head to toe in Yankee clothing.  I'm sure the Cardinal Powers That Be will be able to overlook this transgression. I can only hope my rabid Cardinal fan friends who are reading this (you know who you are!) will find it in your hearts to forgive me.  We had a wonderful dinner of baked ziti while discussing everything from baseball (Melissa is, indeed, an avid and informed Yankee fan) to the political state of affairs in New Jersey.  We were joined by Melissa's mother and two of her brothers  (Yankee fans all).  One of her brothers asked if Gravity and I were hikers or if we were headed to a Santa Claus convention.  Perhaps I will start shaving again when I get back home. After sorting our resupply and eating a couple of bowls of ice cream, we settled into bed in the family room.  While she may not allow herself to be considered an angel, the kindness that Melissa has shown tonight is out of this world.  She does all of this out of the goodness of her heart and is a very kind, special person. I guess for one day, in return for this, I can dress up like a Yankee.  In all seriousness, thank you, Miss Melissa, for taking care of a couple of tired, old hikers.  You may not want to be considered an angel, but you act like one.  Come to think of it, better to be a Yankee fan for one night than an Angels fan. After all, the Angels, not the Yankees, took Albert.","Quarry Road, Unionville, NY

I slept like a baby in my Yankee jammies and awoke with my guilt meter for wearing them was at zero.  One of the things I enjoy about the trail is meeting new people who have never been subjected to my corny jokes, so they actually think they are funny.  Example: How did you sleep last nighr?  I slept like a baby. Cried all night and woke up wet.  I really like it when someone asks me about my knees. I get to tell them that when I was a child, I was a medical miracle; I had four kidneys. Then, I grew up and now have two kidneys and two adult knees.  But enough of my corny jokes, and on with my missive about my day. I did sleep well and woke up at 6:00. I was the first one up, so I quietly got the laundry and took it to the basement. Gravity was soon up, and we both finished packing. Miss Melissa continued being wonderful and made coffee and then made me a huge breakfast sandwich with eggs, ham, and cheese. She then drove us back to the trail, where we thanked her again.  She may not consider herself an angel, but I could make strong arguments otherwise. Thank you again, Miss Melissa!  The trail started out steeply, and then New Jersey let me know in a big way that we weren't through with the rocks. I climbed up and over all shapes and sizes on my way to Pinwheels Vista, atop Wawayanda Mountain.  On my way up, I met Mark, a day hiker who immediately started up a conversation. Like Hoosier, he has been reading my journal and found an opportunity to meet me.  He had already read the day's entry, and we laughed about a life-long Cardinal fan in Yankee attire.  He gave me some pointers about upcoming trail attractions before continuing on his southbound way. Thanks, Mark, for reading my journal and coming out to meet me. It means a lot to me.  I was soon climbing a steep, rocky stairway called, naturally, the Stairway to Heaven.  I sang the Zepplin classic to myself as I climbed.  The views from Pinwheels Vista were fantastic. The trail became easier and I started making better time on my way to the Wawayanda State Park Headquarters, where I got water and ate my lunch.  I left lunch feeling great. I didn't bother with a nap, as it was cooler today, and I didn't feel sleepy.  My plan was to make it to Highway 17, get an ice cream at the Creamery down the road, and make it to Wildcat Shelter well before dark. However, we all know what can happen to the well laid plans of mice and men.  In this case it was huge rocks along miles of ridgeline.  To quote AWOL in my guidebook: Despite the unimposing profile, rocks, abrupt ups & downs make this section challenging.  I really should read the small print more carefully.  They next several miles, the last in New Jersey and the first in New York, were very slow going, indeed. I repeatedly had to forgo using my poles as I crawled up, over, and down huge rock formations along ridgelines. At one place, the rock cliff is so steep that a ladder of rebar is driven into the rock face. Everywhere else, the hiker is left to his or her own devices to figure out a pathway. It was a real challenge which I enjoyed, but my progress was very slow. I finally arrived at the state line, denoted by white paint on the rocks. I paused to set some of Beau free and take a photo. I'm now in New York full time. Not much past the border, I climbed to Prospect Rock, the highway point of the AT in New York. The spot is marked by an American flag flying on a homemade, wooden pole. The wind was blowing, making for an impressive sight.  I continued on, my hopes for ice cream steadily dwindling, when a southbound hiker informed me that the trail for the last few miles to Highway 17 were quite easy, although he didn't know about the last two miles I planned to cover between Highway 17 and the shelter. I found that the prospect of ice cream and wanting to get to camp before dark is as strong a motivation as a thunderstorm.  I made excellent time to the highway and quickly covered the short distance to the Creamery.  Alas, it closes early on Sundays, and I was a few minutes late. Oh well, if I had gotten an earlier start this morning,  I would have had to cut short my time with my favorite Yankee fan, Miss Melissa, and that wasn't about to happen. I was soon back on the trail with only two miles to go to the shelter.  I made great time for the first 1.3 miles and was planning my evening since I would be getting in close to dark. I then was introduced to the Eastern Pinnacles and to Cat Rocks.  The views were great, as was the time and effort to get there.  I took my time,  reminding myself of my natural lack of flexibility and balance. It took quite a bit of hand and feet climbing and a bit of butt scooting, but I made it through.  I was off the rock faces, but not to the shelter, before dark.  Donning the nifty head lamp I procured from Steohen, I made it to the tent site area about ten minutes past datk. A group of fellow hikers were around a fire. I quickly set up my tent and then tried to find the spring beyond the shelter to get some much-needed water. I was unsuccessful at first, and found myself wandering around in a boggy area looking for the blue blazed trail. I now better appreciate the old saying, ""Where in blue blazes is it?"" There was no sense in getting frustrated, and I ended up returning to the fire, hoping for better directions. Instead, one hiker, who had gotten equally as lost and confused in the daylight, went with me and showed me the small box spring.  I had been pretty much on top of it earlier.  It was a good source, and I soon had water. Returning to the fire ring, I had a cold supper of extra food bars as I enjoyed the fellowship that such a fire can bring. It has been several weeks since I have been in an area with a campfire.  I had a long conversation with Bear King, whom I haven't seen since eating with him at Trail Angel Mary's.  We have very similar taste in music, as well as a shared interest in brewing. I told him about Stephen's and my home brewery, Brakeman's Best Brewing Company.  I happened to mention that all of our wheat beers are named from lines in the song, Big Rock Candy Mountains. This turned out to be Bear King's favorite song, as his granddaddy in Texas used to sing it to him when he was young. I stayed at the fire for a long time, enjoying the conversation and decompressing from my day. I got a text from Gravity, who made camp at a stealth site several miles back. I'm sure we'll find a way to get back together soon. It's hard to believe I have another state under my belt and am in New York, a state that has certainly already made a believer out of me.  I'll be back at it tomorrow with a slightly shorter goal to reach Fingerboard Shelter, 14.3 miles to the north.  Right now I am in my tent as a steady rain falls outside. I hope it ends by morning.","NJ 94, Vernon, NJ/Miss Melissa's House

I awoke at 6:10 this morning to the sound of a steady rain on my tent. I decided to wait a few minutes before getting up and promptly fell back asleep.  I woke back up at 7:30 to find that the rain had stopped.  I began packing up. Before too long the rain started again, and I ended up breaking down camp in a steady rain. I kept things as dry as I could and was on the trail by 9:00.  Although this was over an hour later than my usual departure time, I ""only"" had 14.3 miles to go to my planned stop at Fingerboard Shelter.  I was looking forward to getting in several hours before dark to get things dried out. I failed to factor in New York Hiking Time.  Bigfoot, who I've mentioned before, completed the AT last year and has made many helpful and informative videos.  One was about his ten biggest surprises while hiking the AT. His number one surprise?  How difficult New York was.  I hiked straight through today, stopping once to send a few texts and upload my journal and once for lunch. I made it to Fingerboard Shelter at 8:20 this evening as the sun was setting.  It was quite a day.  I started off in a steady rain, and reached Fitzgerald Falls in good time.  Just before the falls, as the rain was letting up, I met Tony, Tracy, and their daughter Hannah.  Sometimes you can sense when you meet people who are joyful and full of life, and this certainly goes for every member of this wonderful family who are hiking a section of the AT in every state. After sharing friendly hellos, we chatted awhile about hiking and about family.  I told them I would be hiking with my daughter soon in Vermont, when Becky flies out to visit her friend Julia and hike with me for five days.  Hannah is a special education teacher who works with students with behavioral and emotional disorders, so we have that in common as well.  We parted ways after only a few minutes together, and I  was in a good mood when I met them and in a better one for having met them. I love meeting people who put an extra spring in my step, and this family certainly did that. Fitzgerald Falls is a pretty waterfall right along the trail.  The trail goes up alongside the falls on steep rock steps. I would now be challenged the rest of the day with steep ascents, descents, and rocky trail. Unlike the last few states where easy trail was interspersed with challenging sections, with one exception when the trail followed a road for 0.4 miles (although even that was uphill), you worked for what you got today.  I hiked up and over Buchanan Mountain, Arden Mountain, and Island Pond Mountain, each one sporting challenging rock scambles that often required climbing with hands and feet.  The descents were also quite steep, and the conditions were made more interesting by the rain-slickened rocks and the wet dirt and leaves.  I slipped numerous times but never fell.  In spite of the difficulty, I tried to remember to look up and appreciate the rugged beauty of the land through which I am journeying.  On the way up Island Pond Mountain, I encountered the famed Lemon Squeezer. The trail goes through a short tunnel, and then you literally squeeze your way through this very narrow crevice. Both sides of my pack were scrapping against the rock walls of the squeezer as I forced my way through. After feeling thoroughly juiced, I then faced the arduous task of climbing out of the squeezer.  I was feeling at a loss on how to get up and over a particularly tall rock overhang when I was met by Ten, a fellow thru hiker I met a few days before.  When she first heard the sounds of my juicing, she thought I  was a bear.  She then entered the squeezer herself and saw me.  We puzzled over the task at hand for awhile and finally took off our packs and muscled them over the top of the overhang. Ten then was able to pull herself up and over the obstacle, and I followed behind.  I was making it, but I gladly accepted the hand up she offered as I pulled my way on top of the overhang. We paused for a minute before tackling the rest of the ascent and agreed it was good fortune we met when we did. She was the first hiker I had seen in quite some time.   Thanks again, Ten, for your help!  The Lemon Squeezer is only two miles to the shelter site, but there were still several other scrambles to be completed before arriving just before dark.  I threw my bear line over a branch and then finished the rest of my chores by the light of my headlamp.  Today was another day that really challenged me. I like the challenges because they are what makes for memories and stories to tell later.  If the whole trail was easy peasy, there would really be no reason to do it. I'm not sure how far I will go tomorrow, but it would be nice to get into camp a bit earlier than I have the past two days. Rain has started falling again as I write fhis, so it could be another wet day tomorrow.  Oh well.  No rain, no pain, no Maine."," Wildcat Shelter Tent Site

Note:  I have uploaded my photos through my stay at West Mountain Shelter. It rained some during the night, but it had stopped by morning.  The day proved to be one perfect for hiking by remaining overcast and cool all day. I saw several hikers wearing jackets.  Many Miles was already packed and getting ready to leave when I exited my tent at 6:45.  I would end up seeing him twice today and was quite taken with his calm, thoughtful demeanor.  He also knows the importance of a good shower, and he told me he was headed to Tiorati Circle and the Lake Tiorati Beach. The beach allows hikers to use their restroom and showers for free. It is also a good place to get water, and there are vending machines.  Ten got out of her tent soon after Many Miles left, and we chatted while we packed up. I again thanked her for her help at the overhang at the Lemon Squeezer.  I've mentioned that spot to several hikers today and found that almost all solo hikers opted for the alternative route. I really enjoyed talking with Ten.  She is trying to catch up with friends, so I don't know if we will see each other again. We exchanged website addresses so we can keep up with each other.  I only planned on going 8.5 miles today to the West Mountain Shelter.  This would set me up well for going through Bear Mountain State Park tomorrow. The AT goes right through the park's zoo.  There is a Trailside Museum, and the trail reaches its lowest elevation of 177 feet above sea level as it passes the bear exhibit. It's all uphill from there.  I also wanted an early finish after the past two days, and this would give Gravity a chance to catch up.  The trail today was very conducive for this, and I made excellent time.  There was lots of rocky trail with relatively steep ascents and descents, but it was just trail with little rock scrambling involved.  I took the 0.3 mile walk down Arden Valley Road to Tiorati Lake, where I again saw Many Miles.  I joined in on his conversation with a very nice mother of two beautiful little girls who were waiting for their swimming lessons.  Their mom offered me a bagel with cream cheese and a banana, which were both delicious. I also bought a dreamcicle from the vending machine, utilized the porcelain facilities, and filled my water bottles at the restroom sink. You could tell they cater to hiker trash by the sign above the sink, which requested that no one wash their clothes or their shoes in the sink.  I was soon back on the trail and had an uneventful walk to William Brien Memorial Shelter where I ate lunch.  I then pushed on to West Mountain Shelter, arriving before four o'clock.  I hiked awhile with Many Miles, but he had to camp closer to the town of Bear Mountain.  He has a package waiting for him there, and the post office is only open for two hours in the morning.  We rested and enjoyed the view from an overlook where the side trail to West Mountain Shelter meets the AT.  The shelter here is little utilized as it is 0.6 rugged miles off trail and there is no water or other facilities available. I decided to hike down the side trail and hopefully find a camping spot closer to the AT.  I was joined in this quest by Baer, a thru hiker I had met several weeks before and by Chris (aka Wolf), a young man who has joined Baer for a week. We found an excellent camp spot a mere 0.2 miles from the trail. I left my pack and continued on to the shelter, from which you can see the New York City skyline. The trail was rugged but well blazed. I read an interesting note in my guidebook about this area, advising hikers to watch carefully for blazes. I mentioned to several people that it would seem to make more sense to simply have someone paint more blazes. Apparently, someone got the memo, for both the side trail and the AT sported many freshly painted blazes. The shelter was stone and had been built by the CCC. The view of the Hudson River was very impressive, and you could just make out the NYC skyline through the clouds.  I've heard it is quite a view when the weather is clear, particularly at nighr. The shelter had recently undergone repairs to its roof, and is an impressive stone building. I was walking back to my campsite when it happened. Wait for it. Build some suspense here. Are you ready? Are you sure you are ready?  I SAW A BEAR!!!  It was walking quickly through the woods to my left, and I had no chance for a photo, but it was definitely a bear.  I was obviously very excited as I returned to camp. I told Baer and Chris, who then told me of the two rattlesnakes sunning themselves on a rock nearby. I quickly went there and saw a timber and a diamondback lying near each other on a large boulder.  I was able to take advantage of this photo opp. I then leisurely cooked dinner, prepared my camp for the night, and hung my bear bag. Bears are active in this area. I know because I saw one!  I was in my sleeping bag before dark. Right at dusk, Jason and Maple, Red Eye, Boomer,  and Skywalker arrived.  Gravity showed up a bit later.  We are all poised to head into Bear Mountain tomorrow. My plan for tomorrow is to resupply at the AT Grill (and camp store) and then spend the night in my tent at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center. I was already planning my comments for when I took photos of the two bears in the zoo, but now that will be unnecessary, as I have finally actually seen one of their wild cousins. It has been another wonderful day.","Fingerboard Shelter Tent Site

I slept well and woke up at the usual 6:10 am.  I hit the trail at 7:45, excited about making it to Bear Mountain State Park.  The trail was quite good with lots of ups and downs, but few obstructions. Soon I was hiking along an old, abandoned asphalt road with a stone retaining wall along the left shoulder.  I imagined families of years gone by motoring along this road in their Model Ts, headed for the Hudson River and the zoo.  The trail abruptly left the roadway and started up a steep embankment.  I stared at what I saw in disbelief.  The trail up the hill consisted of expertly crafted stone stairs. The stairs wound their way up the rock face even spiraling at times.  It was a work of art and made climbing the ascent as easy as climbing a staircase. Some of the steps displayed the grooves where the stone had been drilled and then split. Once at the top of the ridge line, this manicured trail continued toward the Perkins Memorial Tower at the summit of Bear Mountain. There were areas where the stones had been laid like cobblestones to provide better travel through muddy conditions.  Along the way, I passed the 1400 mark, noted by the number spelled out in small stones in the middle of the trail. I recalled the time, half the distance ago, when the 700 mile point had been spelled out in a similar way but with flower petals.  I soon reached the tower, an impressive stone structure with viewing windows along the top.  Unfortunately, it was closed for renovation.  The view from the top of the mountain was spectacular,  and the sky was clear and bright.  You could easily make out the New York City skyline in the distance. One of the many day visitors took my picture as I posed in front of the skyline.  It was here that I discovered the answer to the mystery of the vastly improved trail conditions. In conjunction with Americorps, the state of New York is making huge renovations in the Appalachian Trail in the vicinity of Bear Mountain State Park. A 0.3 mile section was blocked off by orange, plastic construction fencing, with a temporary bypass along the road. There was a large sign explaining the renovation, which included before and after photos of a rocky jumble transformed into a neat and tidy staircase.  It was here that I met Piper, the first southbounder I have met who started at Katahdin.  We chatted a bit about our experiences and about upcoming trail conditions before heading our respective directions.  Upon leaving the bypass, I hiked a short section of more normal trail (probably next year's project) before returning to the new, improved trailway. As I approached the State Park, I found informative signs about the improvements lining the trail.  The process of splitting the rocks and maneuvering them into place was explained in text and photos. My favorite addition are ""coping stones."" According to the sign, coping stones ""keep people . . . away from potentially dangerous drop-offs, providing a sense of safety.""  I laughed as I wondered where my coping stones were while I was clinging to the overhang above the Lemon Squeezer or scaling the rock face above the Lehigh Valley. Actually, these improvements within the park make a great deal of sense and will open up this section for the use of many more day hikers. The trail work is beautifully done, and I wish I had been able to spend more time studying the informative signs and displays.  I just hope that no one gets the mistaken idea that the entire AT is a well-constructed, well-maintained walk in the woods, complete with coping stones to help soothe hikers' anxieties.  I stopped at the food stand and lunched on a tasty cheeseburger with fries, a Pepsi, and a grape Gatorade. You usually request a color, certainly not a flavor, of Gatorade, and I had asked for a blue one. The grape flavor was quite tasty. After lunch, I followed the trail with Hessian Lake to my left and the picnic area to my right. The trail then goes by the swimming pool and enters the Bear Mountain Zoo. The zoo consists of numerous displays of animals, along with different ecological systems, such as bogs, glades, and fern groves. The animals on display are all native to the area. All of the raptors are birds that were injured and would be unable to survive in the wild. When the trail passes the bear display, it is at its lowest elevation of 177 feet above sea level. Had I not seen my bear yesterday, I would have to say that the first bear I saw on the AT was lying in a hammock surrounded by a flock of vultures. I believe the vultures are present on their own accord,  feasting on Purina Bear Chow, and not part of the zoo's official roster. Something set the coyotes off as I walked by (I didn't think I smelled that bad) and the din lasted several minutes.  Proving that zoo keepers can have a sense of humor, there is even a utility pole on display, complete with its own informative sign. Sooner than I really wanted to, I left the zoo to continue on my way. I met Boomer and Red Eye on the way out. Jason and Maple soon joined us as well, and we hiked across the Hudson River over the Bear Mountain Bridge.  The rest of the day's hike was uneventful, with some relatively steep elevation changes under normal conditions. One section was so pretty and so easy to hike that I perhaps for a little carried away and started twirling my trekking poles like batons and singing 76 Trombones out loud.  Fortunately, my spontaneous display of unbridled silliness did not last long, but the happiness that fueled it remained. I soon heard someone else loudly singing, and met Road Runner, my second southbounder from Katahdin. I was surprised that he was not wearing earphones but was simply singing spontaneously as I had before.  We talked awhile and then moved on.  I stopped at the AT market, located right by the AT on Highway 9, ate dinner, resupplied for four days, and chatted with fellow hikers.  It was then a short hike to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center to set up camp.  Owned by the Franciscans, they allow hikers to camp on their ball field and provide water, a shower, porta-potties, and a pavilion with electricity. Another wonderful example of support for the trail and its inhabitants.  There is quite a bunch of us tonight,  but things quieted down at hiker midnight. Today was a very full day, as I knew it would be. Tomorrow looks to shape up as a day to simply hike. Only time will tell.","West Mountain Shelter Tent Site

I woke up at 5:45 this morning and got going immediately since I planned on a slightly longer day today. Looking at the guidebook, it appeared that today would be a day just for hiking, without any added attractions.  The topo lines showed many ups and downs, but none of them of would be for long.  I was on the trail by 7:30, and my estimation of the day proved correct.  As many of you know, I am a model railroader with a relatively large railroad in my basement, measuring 23 x 29 feet. When designing my track plan years ago, I realized that it was important to have some areas that weren't all that busy, as the train traveled from one scene to the next. If the entire railroad was full of busy activity, there would be no sense of traveling from place to place. I thought about that today.  Of course, every day on the AT involves many hours of traveling from place to place, all at the speed of walking.  However, today pointed out to me that there are very few days when the entire day is just a travel day.  It was actually quite nice. The trail consisted of many rocky areas, but none that were all that difficult.  There were countless ascents and descents, but, again, nothing that stood out. The weather was cool and overcast,  ideal for hiking but not for highlighting any scenic views had there been any, which there weren't. It started to lightly sprinkle several times today but always stopped before anything got wet.  I ate lunch in a small glade near a wooden shed and filled my water bottles from a faucet on the side of the shed and took my nap leaning my pack against a sign designating the trail as the AT.  I can't remember another day when all I really did was walk from Point A to Point B. It was actually rather refreshing but should make for a short journal entry tonight. Near the end of the day, I met up with Pippi, Mechanic, and Many Miles on top of Shenandoah Mountain.  There is a weathered American flag painted on the summit measuring perhaps three by five feet, which was painted shortly after 9-11. The four of us relaxed atop the mountain for a bit before finishing the day at a very pretty tenting spot called the Shenandoah Tenting Area. There is an open, grassy field, an old garage with a pavilion and picnic table, a fire ring with two plastic lawn chairs, and an old style hand pump for water. I set up camp, changed out of my sweaty hiking clothes, and spent a wonderful evening just being with my three friends.  Using the hand pump was fun as it had to be pumped quite vigorously to get the water to flow.  We all filtered the water to be on the safe side.  I cooked dinner and ate with the others.  I went to bed at dark.  Gravity, who was delayed by having to do some repair work on his pack,  arrived soon after dark. I plan on another relatively long day tomorrow of eighteen miles.  The only ""scenic"" attraction tomorrow is a deli within easy walKing distance of the AT on NY 52. I just might have to go check out the view.","Franciscan Way/Graymoor Spiritual Life Center

I awoke at 5:45 this morning and went right to work getting ready to hike.  The plan was to do 18.1 miles today, plus I wanted to stop at the Mountain Top Deli for lunch, which added an additional 0.8 miles. I recently had someone ask how I determined how far to walk per day. There are several factors, including: anticipated terrain, available water, weather, days until next resupply, activities planned for the day (such as places to visit and special views), and available tent sites.  The trail goes through a lot of rugged terrain where there simply aren't places to set up a tent. Furthermore, many areas include restrictions that hikers can only camp at shelter areas or other designated spots.  I was on the trail by 7:30 and made good time toward NY 52, where the deli was located. The trail was like yesterday, somewhat challenging in places, but overall easy to hike.  A few miles in, I met Happy Feet, the first woman southbounder I have seen.  From talking to her for a few minutes, it's obvious how she acquired her trail name.  She left Katahdin in early June and is loving the trail.  We talked a few minutes about the trail experience in general and swapped information about upcoming trail conditions before we continued in our respective directions.  I was at NY 52 by 11:30 and quickly covered the 0.4 miles beside the highway to the deli. I passed a large aggregate facility that was busy, noisy,  and quite fascinating.  The deli lived up to its reputation, and I had a yummy chicken sandwich with all kinds of added goodies, as well as a large Gatorade, a bag of crunchy Cheetos, and an ice cream cookie. I ate on the bench outside the building, since I am quite cognizant that it's been awhile since my last shower and laundry opportunity, and I had already been soaked in sweat for several hours today.  I was soon met by Pippi and Mechanic, and Gravity arrived a bit later.  I filled my water bottles at the faucet on the side of the building. Interestingly enough, the water came out of the tap sideways and squirted against the building, instead of heading downward like one would expect. I was able to position my bottles to fill them and then found Gravity to ask him to take care of the problem, as the spigot was clearly defying him. With that bit of humor still hanging in the air, I departed the deli and returned to the trail. I soon encountered a massive tree, the second largest I have seen on the trail. While not the largest, I should pass that tree tomorrow, it is still quite huge and impressive. What does one do with such a tremendous tree on a muggy day after hiking for hours and eating a large lunch? One naps. I settled in on a side away from the trail and prepared for my ten minute power nap. I apparently turned into Stick Van Winkle and slept for nearly an hour. I was finally awoken by two very apologetic women and one very friendly basset hound.  I thanked the puppy for waking me up, as I still had a long way to go.  I can't remember the last time I have taken such a long, hard nap.  It did me good, however, and I hiked strong the rest of the day.  The tree blazing problem in New York was solved with a vengence in one area, where there was a blaze on about every third tree.  Someone even wrote on a blaze, asking the trail maintainer to calm down a bit.  In a move that I'm sure thrilled the ATC, this conscientious maintainer even painted the tips of the trippy rocks. Since there are hundreds of thousands of trippy rocks on the AT (my toes are well acquainted with many of them), I'm not sure what good comes from painting the tips of a handful of them. It is rather unsightly and a bit like spitting into a hurricane. I'm sure the maintainer's heart, if not his or her paintbrush, was in the right place.  I stopped for water at the Morgan Stewart Shelter and got to use another hand pump. The trail continued to be reasonable, although far rockier than in the morning. The disjointed jitterbug was out in force as I wanted to make it to camp before dark. I hiked along Nuclear Lake (it didn't glow) and then up West Mountain, for my first distance view in a few days. I made it to camp by 7:45 and quickly set up camp and threw my bear rope. The sky turned a beautiful shade of orange (Red sky at night. Sailor's delight) as I cooked dinner and prepared for bed. My tent is on the most sloping ground in a long time, but it's not too bad. I just cuddle up against my trekking pole (which holds up my tent) so I don't slide down the hill. Slightly deflating my air mattress helps as well, otherwise it's a bit like being on a Slip and Slide or a ride at Six Flags. Tomorrow should be another relatively long day, which will set us up for an early resupply in Kent the day after tomorrow.  The cheapest lodging we can find in Kent is $200 per night at a Bed and Breakfast, so we plan on getting in early, resupplying, and then hiking out. Which means a few more days delay for that shower and laundry.  I will be helping degrade the air quality in Connecticut, my tenth state, tomorrow.","Shenandoah Tenting Area

I awoke at my regular time and mentally prepared myself for another big day.  The plan was to aim for Schaghticoke Mountain Campsite,  18.3 miles away. This would make it possible to get into Kent, Connecticut early tomorrow for resupply.  After getting water at the stream by the trail, I headed out at 8:30.  Less than a mile into my hike, I crossed West Dover Road and beheld the Dover Oak, the largest tree on the AT.  In its 300 year lifetime, it has grown to an enormous size.  Had I fallen asleep against it, I might very well have slept twenty years.  After admiring its stature and taking some photos, I moved along.  After a few miles in the woods, the trail then began a     0.3 mile trek along a boardwalk over a swamp, which terminated at the Appalachian Trail Railroad Station platform.  Along the way, I met Hugh and his dog, Mollie. Hugh thru hiked the trail back in 1976, about the same time I first acquired the dream of completing my thru hike. Just out of the military at a difficult time in our history, Hugh decided to hike the trail to ""shake hands with America.""  We discussed the differences (he might go five days without seeing another soul on the trail and the only way to contact family and friends was mail and pay phones), as well as the similarities  (wonderful people, beautiful scenery, and Trail Magic).  We parted ways at the train station as I said goodbye to Molly and again thanked Hugh for his service to our nation.  Also at the train station, I met Land Shark and The Edge, two volunteers with the New York/New Jersey Trail Conference, who were headed out with weed eater and chain saw to work on clearing sections of the trail.  Such maintenance is never-ending, since brush quickly grows back to choke the trail, and trees will fall over onto it.  As I have said several times before, these maintainers are pure Trail Angels, and I thanked them for everything they do to help the hikers by helping the trail.  After getting my picture taken at the train platform, I headed out over several miles through farm pasture before re-entering the woods.  I passed a nifty wooden water tower near the trail, yet another little aside that makes the AT so special.  I then met Stan the Man, an avid hiker who plans on thru hiking in five years. I told Stan the Man that I was a Cardinal baseball fan. He had grown up in Peoria as a huge fan of the Birds on the Bat, but now he roots for the Mets. Since there is no longer any real rivalry between the Cards and the Mets, I neglected to tell him that my son Greg's first complete sentence was, ""The Mets are pond scum.""  Stan the Man proved he understands all about thru hiking by gifting me with a frozen bottle of Gatorade (Cardinal red, no less) as we parted ways.  Thanks again, Stan!  Today was perhaps the most idyllic day for hiking yet. It was cool, breezy, and sunny. Most of the trail today was in somewhat open forest, which allowed for the sunlight to shine in dappled patterns on the forest floor.  These patches of sunlight moved and danced as the breeze rustled the leaves.  Add the sounds of the woodland birds and the sight of scurrying squirrels, and it was an easy time to love being on the AT.  I've recently encountered another recent addition at some of the shelters, which have small, stocked libraries.  The one I saw today was particularly special, consisting of an enclosed box with shelves and a glass door, and the instructions to ""Take a book.  Leave a book.""  Maintained by volunteers,  these little libraries add a special, homey touch to the shelters.  Perhaps these libraries mean a bit extra to me, since my older brother, Mark, and my daughter's best friend, Julia, are librarians.  I hiked for several miles today with another Julia, who tries to get out and hike every day. A consulting engineer who specializes in waste water treatment, Julia spends half of each year in this area hiking and enjoying the woods and nature.  She is very knowledgeable about the area and shared numerous tips covering everything from water sources to trail conditions to the fact that the town of Kent recently added a coin-operated shower for hikers.  The time flew by as we walked and talked and, before I knew it, I was in Connecticut. As I do when I enter every new state, I set a bit of Beau free.  Julia actually extended our conversation by hiking with me to the road past her car, before we parted ways.  Well met, Julia, and thanks for sharing your afternoon with me.  The trail then went up and over Ten Mile Hill and crossed Ten Mile River over an impressive walking bridge.  Just yards past the bridge, the Ten Mile joins the Housatonic River, a noisy, boisterous river with lots of rapids, which I hiked beside for about a mile.  I left the river to begin climbing Schaghticoke (pronounced Scat-a-coke) Mountain.  At the foot of the mountain, I encountered my second Trail Magic of the day. Dora the Explorer left a cooler full of Gatorade by the trail. I quickly drank one before continuing up the mountain and then to the campsite. I guess the AT in Connecticut needs to remind us that she can hold challenges as well, and the hike up the mountain was quite arduous, but I was rewarded with a nice view from Indian Rocks near the summit. The trail into the campsite was very steep and rocky, and terminated in a wonderful little cul de sac near a stream.  I made it to camp at 7:45, later than I had hoped,  but with still more than enough time to set up camp before dark.  I said hi to Pippi and Mechanic before finding an area and pitching my tent.  Gravity also made it in before dark. Tomorrow we head for Kent to resupply and to consider if it's worth $2.00 in quarters to shower and then put back on the same sweaty, smelly clothes (no laundromat in Kent yet). That's a decision best left for tomorrow.","Telephone Pioneers Shelter Tent Site

Note:  I uploaded all photos up to and including today.
Today began bright and early with a change in plans.  Gravity and I were discussing the day, when we realized that the town of Cornwall Bridge was an easily accessible 14.3 miles away and included both a motel and a grocery store.  I looked back in my journal entries and determined that it had been eight sweaty days since our last shower. So we decided against making a resupply pit stop in Kent and headed for Cornwall Bridge instead.  The day was as beautiful today as yesterday, although a tad warmer.  The trail off of Schaghticoke Mountain was as rocky as the trail up had been. Honestly, I would not be surprised if the percentage of rocky trail in Connecticut rivals or even surpasses the percentage in Pennsylvania. Perhaps people tend to focus on one aspect of a state. In PA it's the rocks, while in Connecticut it's the scenic, flat trail along the Housatonic River.  Trust me, however, Miss Connecticut earns her credibility as a state with some truly challenging trail. I worked my way up Caleb's Peak and was rewarded with a very pretty view.  It was while I was headed to St. John's Ledges, a very steep rocky descent to the Housatonic,  when a southbounder said those magic words that are music to all thru hikers ears, ""Trail Magic ahead."" He told me a fellow was grilling cheeseburgers for all hikers at the parking lot at the bottom of St. John's Ledges. He said he didn't know how long he would be there, and added the caveat to be very careful going down the ledges as they are almost vertical in places.  He warned me to take my time and be very careful. I hiked as quickly as I could to the ledges and found him true to his word. It was slow, careful work going down the rock faces, and I often found myself clinging to craggy handholds as I worked my way downward. Two thoughts kept going through my head.  One was, where in the world are my Coping Stones?  The second was, Death/Cheeseburger?  I was afraid I would get to the parking lot in time to see this unknown Trail Angel's tail lights disappear in a cloud of fruitless dust. The desire to postpone death or injury won out, however, and I took all the time I felt I needed to descend the ledges. Did I mention that Connecticut isn't all flat? I was further delayed by a black snake that I disturbed at the foot of the ledges. He was none too pleased by my intrusion on his domain, but we parted amicably enough after I took his photo . I finally reached the parking lot and met my latest Trail Angel, Tinkerbell. Tinkerbell, who looks as much like the Disney character as I do, is a section hiker who comes out several weekends a year to grill burgers and provide other goodies to hikers.  He is a very friendly, funny guy who can also grill a first-class cheeseburger. I feasted on my burger and also enjoyed cookies, an orange, and Gatorade. Gravity was close behind me and got in on the action as well. Thank you, Mr. Tinkerbell, who is a true gentleman and trail angel, even if he doesn't believe my claim that I was at Comiskey Park in 1979 for Disco Demolition.  I really should have kept my ticket stub. After thanking Tink once again, I hiked quickly along the next several miles of trail, which run alongside the Housatonic River.  These miles are billed as some of the easiest on the trail. It may be ironic, then, that I took the hardest fall of my trip (pun intended) when I stumbled over a root and performed a very awkward attempt to regain my balance before giving into the inevitable and falling quite hard on my right side. Fortunately, there was no.harm done, and I was soon back on my way. Me and my hundreds of new found friends. The gnats along the Housatonic are almost legendary. I was literally swarmed by hundreds as I walked along.  Gnats don't bother me much. The animal I most fear on the trail is the deer tick, and I regularly apply Permethrine to my clothing and spray on deet at least once per day. Mosquitos are another concern. Gnats don't bite, sting, or spread disease. Like a lot of life's problems, they are simply annoying.  I was fascinated how they kept up with me as a walked.  It was almost kaleidoscopic as they surged back and forth around my face.  Sometimes one would land on the lense of my glasses, and I would see how long it would stay.  Few actually landed on my face, and I just pretended it was some new form of performance art and hiked on. After leaving the river, the last few miles of trail went steeply up and back down to Highway 4.  Gravity and I walked the additional 1.5 miles to the motel (no luck hitching). There are no restaurants in Cornwall Bridge, so we stopped at the Citgo for dinner. I quickly added dining on a gas station cheeseburger to my bucket list (right after savoring good whiskey), and it wasn't all that bad. I also got two ice cream sandwiches and a large Gatorade. We then completed our walk to the motel. I took that long-delayed shower and changed into my town clothes. The motel personnel will wash our clothes tomorrow. I have them in a white trash bag and considered leaving them in the office to get washed first thing in the morning. No joke, they smell so rank that we are afraid they might get thrown out as garbage. The general store opens at 6:00 in the morning, so I will drop off our clothes in person in the morning when we go for resupply.  It's been quite a day, and I must admit that a bed and air conditioning at the Hitching Post Motel is not a bad outcome. Back on the trail tomorrow to start getting all smelly and dirty again as I near Massachusetts.","Schaghticoke Mountain Campsite

Happy Birthday to my son, Stephen! While this entry is about July 31st, I'm writing it in early in the morning of August 1st, which is Stephen's birthday. Stephen hiked with me from Hot Springs to Erwin. He is a wonderful young man, with many talents. He is an avid homebrewer, as well as my walking and lifting partner back home.  I have often said that one of the most gratifying parts of being a parent is when you have adult children who would be close friends even if they weren't your children. I have been blessed this way three times.  Happy Birthday, Stephen, and I hope you have a great day.  I woke up at my regular time this morning and took the bag of laundry to the hotel office. I got dressed and leisurely packed some things.  We had to.wait for our clothes before we could check out and head for the general store for resupply. The plan was to resupply and then head for Belters Campsite, 11.2 miles ahead.  Our clothes were soon returned, transformed almost magically into clean looking, and clean smelling, garments. It is a wonderful feeling to be clean and wearing clean clothes. A warm day was in the forecast, so I knew this wouldn't last long, but it was great while it lasted. It was while packing up that I realized I was missing an important part of my gear.  My fuel bottle, a plastic bottle full of denatured alcohol, was not to be found. I then realized what probably happened.  When I took that bad spill yesterday, all of my water bottles came flying out of my pack onto the trail. I am guessing my fuel bottle also went flying and landed off the trail in the brush.  Again, fortune smiled upon me. On the way to the general store, I stopped at the Benjamin Moore paint dealer across the street. I purchased a small can of alcohol, and the employee there found an empty soda bottle in the trash. My fuel bottle now falsely advertises  that it is Barq's Root Beer, but it will work just fine. Denatured alcohol isn't always easy to find, and had this mishap occurred early in a resupply, I could have gone days without being able to use my stove. The Cornwall Country Market is a homey store that quickly became one of my favorite stores I have visited on the trail.  The owner was very helpful and friendly, as were the cooks in the back and the woman behind the counter.  I ordered a breakfast burrito that was huge and delicious.  I resupplied for four days and also purchased a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch today.  It was the perfect sandwich to eat several hours later sitting on a log in the woods.  I thanked the staff, and then Gravity and I headed back across the street to the Cornwall Package Store. My guidebook contains a teasing comment about this store, and states that stopping to sign their register can be refreshing. It is a tradition there that if a thru hiker signs their guest book, they receive a free beer.  Ethan, the very friendly and personable employee, showed us the available beers. I chose a Founders Session IPA. This is yet another example of a store in a small town reaching out to hikers.  There is a bulletin board with photos from Katahdin that hikers have sent them. Hopefully in a few months, my photo will be on their wall as well. It was around noon when we started back on the trail. The cloudless sky was bright blue, and the sun was busy doing its shining down thing.  The temperature was much warmer than it had been.  My nice, clean clothes rapidly were soaked in sweat again as I tackled the many ups and downs that comprised today's hike.  I decided to take the short Breadloaf side trail to a view of the surrounding mountains. On the overlook, I found the Honeymooners eating their lunch. We had a great reunion and discussed the beauty of Connecticut, the great weather of the past few days, and the difficulty of today's trail.  I hadn't seen them since we shared lunch in that stone pavilion many days ago, and it was good to catch up with them. I also met a wonderful group of young women today. They were with a wilderness school and were on their fifth day of a backpacking trip.  They will also be doing climbing and kayaking. We had a fun conversation about the hardships of backpacking (no showers, and Honesty really misses juice).  It was a great time, and I wish them well on all of their future adventures. I soon realized that today would continue to be a day of steep, rocky ascents and descents with very little easy trail. It was also very warm. I took a short nap by a little stream, and then hiked up another ascent and squeezed my way through a cracked boulder, similar to the Lemon Squeezer. This one was a bit easier and a lot of fun. I began to realize that our goal of Belters Campsite was probably too ambitious for today's weather and trail conditions. Sharon Mountain Campsite was three miles closer.  When Gravity caught up with me, we decided to alter plans and camp there instead. It was about 7:15 when I walked into the site, feeling pretty worn out and ready to call it a day. Several other hikers, including the Honeymooners and Heading Home (he's from Maine) were already there. We all concurred that it had been a tough hike today. I set up camp, fetched water from the nearby stream, cooked dinner, and headed for bed. It has been another very full day. According to my guidebook, tomorrow holds some views of waterfalls, a climb up Mount Prospect, and something called ""Giant's Thumb.""  That should prove interesting.","CT 4, Cornwall Bridge, CT/The Hitching Post Motel

Note: The Hiking Viking uploaded his interview with me on his YouTube channel, Between the Blazes, today. I don't think I embarrassed myself too badly.
Today was a day for milestones. As I mentioned yesterday, today is my son Stephen's birthday.  I texted him first thing this morning.  Later in the morning, as I crossed the Housatonic River for the first time, I passed 700 miles to Katahdin.  This afternoon, near Salisbury, I crossed the 1500 mile marker. As I write this in my tent near the Riga shelter, I have traveled 1503 miles and am only 2.8 miles from the Connecticut/Massachusetts border, so I'll pass another milestone in the morning.  I was on the trail by 8:00 this morning and worked my way off off Sharon Mountain back to the Housatonic River.  I crossed the river  on the US 7 bridge, one of several times I would hike along roads today. I continued on the road past a High School. It was sunny again today and quite a bit warmer than yesterday.  Of course, it felt much warmer walking on an asphalt road as opposed to in the woods.  The trail soon returned to the woods and was much easier near the river, and I made good time.  The trail followed a road again near Falls Village, and I passed a large electric way station.  The electric company has installed a water faucet and cold water shower head on the outside of a building. I filled my water bottles, ate my lunch under a shade tree, and watched several hikers strip down to their skivies and take showers.  I dearly love ""Hiker Trash"" moments.  After lunch, I crossed the Housatonic River again, this time via a modern (completed in 2016) iron bridge. The trail again paralleled the Housatonic, and I soon took a short side trail to view the river as it cascaded down a ravine in a huge waterfall. It was a very impressive sight.  I then hiked up a steep hill beside the waterfall and decided to walk over and view it from the top. Here, my tendency to become disoriented served me well. I missed a turn in the trail as I assumed it went across the parking lot for the falls. Actually, as I discovered later, the trail veers left and never comes within view of the parking lot or the adjacent picnic area. Unaware of this at the time, I walked across the parking lot looking for white blazes. Instead, I had the good fortune of meeting Curt, Edie, and Rolf who were picnicking by the falls. They invited me over. They said they hadn't met a thru hiker before and asked me to join them for lunch. I was offered a delicious ham and cheese sandwich, chips, and cookies. I spent a wonderful half hour visiting with them. I told them about thru hiking and told them they were my most recent Trail Angels. Rolf declared that that was the first time anyone ever called him an angel. I very much enjoyed the visit. Thank you again for your hospitality, Curt, Edie, and Rolf!  I still had ten miles to travel, which included climbing Mount Prospect and then the Lion's Head.  I first backtracked to the falls, located a white blaze, and determined where I had made my very fortuitous mistake. Back on the trail, I worked my way up Mount Prospect.  The trail was steep at times but was without rocky protrusions, so I made pretty good time.  As the trail came down the mountain, it opened into a beautiful field with a tremendous view. Named Rand's View, it is very picturesque and looks like it should be a picture puzzle. Back in the woods, I  soon passed the Giant's Thumb, a large vertical boulder deposited in an upright position by some long ago glacier.  The trail completed its way down the mountain, and I again found myself walking along roads. As I entered the town of Salisbury, I discovered an interesting phenomenon when I photographed the electronic speed indicator that was set up by the speed limit sign entering town.  As a car approached, its speed was flashed on a screen. To the unaided eye, a number was clearly visible,  but through my phone's camera lense, the number flashed and blinked continually, never showing a specific number. I  was intrigued and watched the sign through both my eyes and my phone's camera as several cars sped by (most going significantly faster than the posted 30 MPH). After perhaps a mile, I was back in the woods, hiking up my last ascent of the day to Lion's Head. About half way to the top, I met Leapfrog and Extra Mile, who were again slackpacking southbound today. It was another happy reunion. They cautioned me about the very steep descent i will encounter tomorrow as I hike up and over Bear Mountain on my way out of Connecticut.  While the Bear Mountain in New York prides itself in its new, improved trail work, I'm pretty certain it's a safe bet that there will be very few coping stones on my way down Connecticut's. That's for tomorrow, as I arrived at the Riga Shelter Tent Site area around 7:15 and set up camp. I again met up with the Honeymooners, who told me the sunrise is reported to be gorgeous from here. This shelter certainly boasts one of the finest views of any shelter I have visited.  I finished my chores and hope to get up early tomorrow to catch the sunrise. Tomorrow will find me in Massachusetts,  my eleventh state on my way to Maine.","Sharon Mountain Campsite

I was up very early this morning, as I wanted to watch the sunrise. The Honeymooners had told me that the sunrise view from the shelter was reportedly spectacular. I left my tent at 4:45, found a not completely uncomfortable rock to sit on, and prepared to watch the show. A slight touch of orange was in the sky when I got there, and I quietly watched as it grew in the sky. Brad and Nicholette joined me after a bit, and the three of us shared the moment when the sun came up. It was magnificent. I realize that there is a sunrise there everyday, but that fact failed to diminish the beauty of the moment. With the sun up, it was time to prepare for the rest of the day. As in the last several states, Massachusetts asks hikers to only use established camping areas. There was one such area, 9.7 miles away, and the next one was over 24 miles ahead, which certainly wasn't happening.  There were also three mountains to climb within that 9.7 mile stretch, so I figured on a pretty short day, although strenuous day. It sort of worked out that way. The climb up Bear Mountain was pretty standard fare. The way the climb went, you kept thinking you were near the top (it looked just around the corner). I finally decided to stop anticipating and just walk until the summit arrived. When I did get there, I was greeted by a large stone observation monument, made of unmortered stone. I scrambled to the top and enjoyed the view before heading down the mountain.  As promised, the northern slope.of Bear Mountain is very rocky and very steep.  I took my time and didn't have too much difficulty. It was a bit like a Chinese puzzle, where each new rock face had a solution.  I remembered to ""stay to the left"" at one particularly steep, slick spot, and was able to get past that area by holding onto a tree and doing a controlled slide to a lower ledge.  Three times I opted for the sit down and slide on your butt technique, which, while perhaps a bit undignified, can be quite effective.  Gravity and I stayed within sight of each other, and we both made it down in fine shape.  It was then on to Massachusetts.  The woods as I entered my next state, had a thicker, older feel than was the norm in Connecticut.  There was green moss on the trees and rocks, and the trail followed a large stream for over a mile.  There were numerous small waterfalls and pools in the stream.  It was darkly beautiful and reminded me a bit of something out of the Lord of the Rings. The trail eventually left the creek and started upward.  About a mile beyond, I came to another, much smaller stream.  It was a pretty spot, and I decided to take an early lunch. The weather was warm and muggy, so I also took a brief nap after I ate.  Thunder began rumbling in the distance as I started up Rand Mountain.  Massachusetts AT took a page from the playbook of her sister states, and the climb up Rand Mountain was quite rocky and steep, with many of the large, sloped boulders that can be so easy to slip on.  I felt refreshed from food and nap and made good time up the mountain. Thunder continued to rumble, but it was distant and no rain fell.  I wanted to try to get past Rand and Everett Mountains before the potential rain slickened the rocks.  The top of Rand consists of a half-mile of semi-exposed ridgeline which provided great views of the valley below,  as well as views of areas where rain was already falling. The trees were short pines, not much taller than I am.  A pleasant piney odor filled the air, and there were lots of birds. I crossed the ridge rather quickly, as I did not want to be there if the storm chose to close in. I made it down Rand and almost immediately started up Everett  (say it fast, and it almost sounds like Everest, a slightly more ambitious climbing project). To digress a moment: hiking the AT is the equivalent of hiking to the top of Mount Everest and back down the equivalent of sixteen times. We climb up and down lots of hills and mountains.  A light rain fell briefly as I started up Everett, just enough to make all of the rocks wet and even slicker than they normally are.  While short, the ascent was quite steep and challenging.  Clambering over the numerous sloped boulders reminded me of Southern New York.  I reached the top and sat on one of the concrete foundation pads that used to support a fire tower.  I was joined by Furprittius and his friend, Violet.  I knew I would like Furprittius by the Bob Ross t-shirt he was wearing. I loved watching Bob Ross years ago, and saw him create hundreds of ""happy, little trees."" Although in no way an artist, I do try to incorporate Ross's spirit in the scenery I create for my model railroad. I asked Furprittius if he were a fan or if he just happened to pick up the shirt at a yardsale.  He was a big fan. He had completed a sobo thru hike in 2013 and was out hiking today with his friend, Violet. We had a great chat about our favorite television artist and about hiking.  Being a long distance hiker himself, he was not surprised when I enthusiastically and gratiously accepted the orange he offered me.  Gravity showed up just then, and he got an orange as well.  After a bit more conversation, we parted ways. Gravity and I hiked together down Mount Everett  to the Guilder Pond Picnic Area. The AT parallels Mount Everett Road most of the day down the mountain.  The road was gravel and smooth. The AT was rocky and rough.  You just have to love this trail. The two thoroughfares converged at the picnic area, which provided two wonderful benefits. There were numerous bottles of water labelled for thru hiker use on a picnic table. There was also a solar powered privy, the first I have ever seen. I decided to make use of this high tech marvel and listened to the quiet whirring of some composting machine while I pooped.  The privy was odorless and quite nice. It must have been running on its back up batteries, however, because the rain returned in earnest while I was occupied. Gravity and I walked in a heavy thunderstorm the remaining half mile to the camping area. Instead of being upset that the rain hit before I got to camp, I decided to be very happy that it waited until we were off the mountains. It was only lightly drizzling when I set up my tent and had stopped completely as I cooked supper.  While surprisingly strenuous,  today was a pretty short day and for the first time in a great while, I was in bed before it got dark. Everything in my tent was nice and dry, and I was soon warm and snug in my sleeping bag. It was a very full day as I find myself in my eleventh state.  It's time now to go back to sleep and be ready for tomorrow.","Riga Shelter Tent Site

I awoke at my usual time of 5:45, but my body wasn't done resting yet, and I dozed back off until 6:15. We were traveling only 10.8 miles today to Homes Road to meet up with friends of Gravity who were driving from Indiana to see him. Unsure of the upcoming trail conditions, we wanted to make sure we arranged a meeting place that we could reach before too late in the day. I was on the trail by 8:00 and began by hiking up Mount Bushnell.  The trail conditions up and over Bushnell consisted of a great deal of rocky maneuvering, and I was only able to cover a bit over three miles in the first three hours. I was greeted with a tremendous view from the top of the mountain, as I was above the clouds.  Standing on the mountain, I was looking down on nothing but white, fluffy clouds.  Except for the trees and the standing on a ridge part, I could have been in an airplane.  It waa quite something to realize that I was standing in bright sunshine while the folks below were in complete cloud cover. I hiked along the ridge for close to a mile and met Sarah as I was beginning my descent. Sarah is a Ridge Runner, and I had a wonderful conversation with her. She is interested in conservation and conservation education, and she is passionate about sharing the concept of Leave No Trace. She particularly enjoys educating children. When the summer ends, she has a job lined up as an interpretive ranger in the Georgia State Parks. I shared a tip I use when teaching young people about the proper way to dig and use catholes.  Baby Ruth candy bars make great visual aids, and the mini size ones are great to give out at the end of the presentation.  Anything to help a fellow educator!  I thoroughly enjoyed our chat and walked away in a very fine mood.  Good luck, Miss Sarah, and well met! Just after meeting Sarah, I hiked onto Jug End, another overlook. The clouds were beginning to clear by then.The area to my right still had some cloud cover, while the area to my left was clear.  The view was quite impressive indeed.  Continuing along the descent I passed many southbounders and briefly talked with most of them as we passed along information about upcoming trail conditions, water availability, and good places to camp. I was told that the trail in Massachusetts would become much easier soon.  Such was the case, and I began making better time as I hiked through woods that were darker and fuller than in Connecticut. The land became quite marshy and there were many instances of hiking along boardwalks consisting of split logs. The land then dried out, and I found myself hiking along pleasant pastures, cows, corn, and sheep.  As I prepared to cross MA 41, I met Big Chicken and Monty as they were getting their backpacking trip under way. They told me they were  going out for three days, I believe.  This is Monty's very first backpacking trip. They both hail from Connecticut, and Big Chicken said he had considered planning their route to begin with the ascent of St. John's Ledges, but figured that would be way too mean to Monty. I told them about my cheeseburger/death dilemma I faced the other day.  We had a great chat, and we wished each other well on our respective journeys. Who knows, Monty may put a thru hike on his bucket list for after his children are grown. It was on my bucket list for forty years before it came to fruition.  Good luck, fellows, on this and all your future adventures!  I continued making good progress and soon crossed Sheffield Egrement Road.  Just prior to the road, someone (very likely Sarah) had left numerous bottles of water labelled for thru hikers.  I took advantage even though I probably already had enough and topped off my bottles, as the day had changed from warm to hot. Just past the road, I passed a monument commemorating the last battle of Shay's Rebellion in 1787. Daniel Shay, a Massachusetts farmer, led a rebellion that helped highlight weaknesses in the Articles of Confederation that led to the Constitutional Convention and our new government. I was really enjoying being able to walk without having to work my way around obstructions when I began to climb June Mountain. The ascent was much more gradual than usual, and I was able to continue to motor along.  I did come across a sight that really caught my eye. As I mentioned earlier, the tree cover in Massachusetts tends to be somewhat heavier than in Connecticut, resulting in a darker effect that makes the forest seem older and more somber. From quite a long distance, I noticed a small, brilliant bright light. Intrigued, I finally got close enough to recognize a single, white mushroom basking in a round circle of sunlight coursing through the forest leaves. It looked like the star of the play taking a curtain call at the end of a show. (Okay, maybe I have been in the woods a tad too long, but it did look pretty cool). I soon arrived at Homes Road and settled on a rock to wait for Gravity and for his friends.  I was never one for feeling bored, and I greatly enjoyed just sitting on that rock resting and chatting with the few other hikers who passed by. Gravity arrived first, followed in a bit by his friends, John and Sherri. As I mentioned, they drove from Indiana to meet up with him. They picked us up and took us to a very nice hotel in Lenox. We had a great dinner at the Old Heritage Tavern. As I entered the tavern, I was immediately accosted by a large, framed photograph of the 2004 Red Sox in the midst of their victory celebration.  As you may recall, the BoSox made history by becoming the first team to overcome a three game deficit when they roared back by taking four in a row to defeat the Yankees to earn a berth in the World Series.  They then continued their winning ways by sweeping the Cardinals four games to zero to win the series. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and walked quickly past the photograph.  I felt a cold chill wash across me as I hurried past, and then all was well again. We'll get breakfast tomorrow and then resupply before they take us back to the trail. We had a great time at dinner, and Gravity is blessed to have such good friends. Thank you Trail Angels, John and Sherri! At the hotel, Trail Magic of a very special kind happened today.  The hotel is over fifteen miles from where we were picked up and can't get much business from hikers. When I took our dirty clothes to the hotel's laundry room, I noticed that the machine was already in use. I glanced at the young woman in the laundry room through the little window in the door, and thought, ""She looks a lot like Dory.""  Imagine my surprise and joy to discover it was Dory. They had met a friend earlier in the day, and Dory's mom had gotten them a room in the same motel we are in. There was a joyous reunion with Dory and Splat, who joined us for dinner. They said they were planning on staying in their room and ordering pizza, so if we hadn't run into each other in the laundry, we probably would have been unaware we were in the same hotel. What a wonderful happenstance. It was so good to see them and catch up with their progress.  Chance encounters with friends you haven't seen for several weeks is part of the joy of hiking this trail.  Dory and Splat are a few days ahead, but that doesn't mean we won't see them again as we all begin to close in on Maine.","Glen Brook Shelter Tent Site

I slept very well in the hotel and woke up at my regular time.  I laid everything out the night before, and with the wonder of air conditioning, all the residual dampness from the previous storm was gone. As we shall see, this was short-lived. We met John and Sherri for breakfast at 7:00.  The hotel had one of those really good continental breakfasts, and I had eggs, sausage, cereal, muffins, and fruit. While I find I don't miss coffee on the trail, it is a glorious addition while in town. Although coffee was readily available in the front lobby, I always like to make coffee in the little coffee makers in the room, because they are fun to use. And people say I am easily amused!  We left for Price Chopper to resupply right after breakfast.  John and Sherri then drove me back to the trail.  I thanked them again for all of their kindness. Thanks, John and Sherri!  I got busy and sorted and packed my food on a large boulder by the trail.  I often have extra food at resupply time,  as many items come in packages of six, and I was only resupplying for four days. I don't mind carrying some extra food, but food is heavy and there is only so much room in my food bag.  I usually leave any extra food in a hiker box, but there was certainly no hiker box on the side of Homes Road.  As if on cue, a portable hiker box arrived in the persons of Pheasant Man, Dozer, and Umbrella Face.  These three young men performed a great sacrifice and helped me eat the extra food I didn't want to carry.  They proudly took one for the team. Sherri had also given me some unbelievably delicious designer cookies to share as trail magic, and these three stalwart hikers were the first lucky recipients of her kindness.  By the time everything was said and done,  I began my hike at 10:15.  My plan was to go 14.7 miles to Shaker Campground. The first mile and a half were very slow as I worked my way up and over East Mountain.  The trail took a sharp turn to the right as it crossed over a large rock face, and I, along with apparently many others judging by the signs of foot traffic and pokey holes from trekking poles, missed the turn.  I found myself on a very narrow, soft dirt ledge with a large, impassable boulder in front and a very steep drop off behind. I ended up taking off my pack, working my way back down the dirt ledge, and scouting out the trail. I soon located the turn I should have made, retrieved my pack, and slowly made it back to the trail. There was a view from the top ridge, and then it was down the opposite side, which was also steep and rocky.  Thunder started rumbling on my way down. The rain began in earnest at noon, and I walked mostly in heavy rain and thunderstorms for most of the next five hours.  Fortunately, the trail was much easier to traverse. The rain slackened for a bit around 1:30, so I stopped and ate lunch. Around 3:00 I found a perfectly placed boulder, sat on it while it supported my pack, and took a short nap in the rain.  As I have noted before, I usually like hiking in the rain, and today was no exception.  I met numerous sobos today, but few people want to stand and chat during a storm. There are no more view pictures today because, one, my phone was put away in storm mode, and, two, there frankly weren't any more views today anyway.  It was still raining pretty steadily when I passed a pond about four miles from my destination. I considered getting out my phone even in the rain but decided the pond looked, well, like a pond. Having many other pond and lake photos, I decided to just push on.  The rain pretty much ceased by 6:00, and I arrived at Shaker Campsite around 7:15. There were several thru hikers and a group of section hikers already there, so I had a bit of a time locating a good spot for my tent. It was during my search that I became acquainted with another type of Trail Angel.  I was contemplating a spot, wondering if it would block a path,  when a gentleman approached me, welcomed me to the campsite,  and told me the spot was just fine. This is how a met Joe, aka Tonto.  Joe is a caretaker, one of about twelve volunteers with the Massachusetts Appalachian Trail Committee, who help out at the shelters and campsites along the AT in the state.  He helps out hikers with advice and assistance, as well as maintaining the physical areas.   He invited me to stay at Upper Goose Pond Cabin tomorrow night.  He said he would be there with the group of new backpackers he is assisting.  The Appalachian Mountain Club sponsors classes for new backpackers.  Joe told me they start with seminars in the spring, and then the participants go on increasingly more challenging backpacking trips.  It sounds like the same concept we used with our High Adventure Group in the Boy Scouts. Rumor has it that there might be pancakes at the cabin in the morning. A special thanks to Joe and his fellow caretakers for all they do to help promote and maintain the trail. He is one of the unsung heroes whose volunteer service help make the AT what it is.  Thank you, Joe, and your fellow caretakers!  I hope I can make a layover at Upper Goose Pond Cabin work as I arrange my hiking schedule so I can meet up with Becky in Vermont.  In less than a week, she'll join me for several days of hiking,  and I am very excited.  Bed time now.  There will be cereal bars for breakfast tommorow with perhaps dreams of pancakes for the day after. I do love pancakes.","Homes Road/Hampton Inn, Lenox, MA

I awoke this morning to the sound of rain on my tent. Breaking camp in the rain can be a real challenge. Fortunately, it wasn't a hard rain. I got dressed and then fetched my food bag from the bear box. I brought it back to my tent.  I got out the food I would need for the day and packed my entire pack except for the tent while inside my tent.  I got out of my tent, quickly took it down, and stowed it away.  I was able to keep everything almost completely dry this way. I also packed in record time and was on the soggy trail before 7:30. The rain ceased almost immediately, and it developed into a fine day for hiking. The first order of business was a fairly straightforward hike up Cobble Hill.  The view from the summit was quite interesting and included a stately church and graveyard in the valley below. I was soon joined by Joe and his class of backpackers.  I took their ""class photo"" and chatted briefly with them before they continued on toward Upper Goose Pond.  JP then arrived, and we hiked together for awhile.  He originally planned on having a big mileage day, but changed his mind and decided that ten miles today equalled pancakes tomorrow. It was great to catch up with him, since we hadn't seen each other in several weeks.  As we crossed Jerusalem Road, we noticed a small building with a large AT sign adorning its wall not far from the trail. In another example of fun things to discover along the trail, it turned out to be a small store for hikers, or, perhaps more accurately, a well-stocked lemonade stand for hikers. A sign inside informed us that the hiker stand was operated by two young people. Inside was a refrigerator full of Gatorade and soda, along with boxes of chips, cookies, pop tarts, and other goodies on shelves. There was an outlet strip for charging phones and a take-one/leave-one library.  You could also purchase duck and chicken eggs. A price list and money box were on the shelf by the refrigerator.  It was a dandy set- up, and I was quite impressed with the entrepreneurship of the young people who operated it.  I wrote in the log book and purchased a Gatorade, a Pepsi, and a bag of Cheetos.  Cost in dollars: $4.00. Value of the experience: Priceless.  JP and I enjoyed our goodies at the picnic table and then continued on.  About a mile later, we crossed another road to find a cooler loaded with slices of cold watermelon. I love surprise trail magic even more than I love watermelon.  JP had made up his mind to head for Upper Goose Pond and hiked on ahead.  I soon caught up with Joe and his group and was invited to hike with them. I have hiked most of the 1500+ miles I have so far covered alone, and it was fun to be part of a group for awhile. We made steady time the rest of the day and arrived at Upper Goose Pond Cabin by 3:30. I was able to talk more with Joe along the way and learned that he is a very experienced backpacker with a deep love for the AT and for Massachusetts.  He is also a natural teacher and led his group from behind, allowing them to make the decisions that were required along the way. I was invited to camp with them, and set up my tent with their group. The cabin at Upper Goose Pond is amazing and features a large gathering area, a large front porch, and bunks replete with mattresses upstairs.  I met Ken, this week's caretaker, who explained the set-up.  I was momentarily distracted by the aroma of his cup of coffee, and he told me there would be coffee with the pancakes tomorrow morning. He advised me to be there early, since the coffee goes fast. Don't worry, the alarm is set.  I went down to see Upper Goose Pond, which is actually a beautiful lake. There is a wooden dock and two canoes. I stripped down to my skivies and had a swim. Thoroughly refreshed, I returned to camp to cook supper.  I would later return to the pond near sunset and chatted with JP, Umbrella Face, Pheasant Man, and Sean (one of Joe's backpackers). I wandered back to the tent site and wound down my day sitting at a picnic table sharing stories and laughter with Joe and his hikers.  I headed for bed around 8:00. As usual, I made notes for my journal entry and then dozed off. Usually, I wake up a few hours later and type the day's entry into my phone. Tonight, I had a dream that I was having to hike over very rugged terrain in the dark while writing my journal.  I woke up at 11:30 a tad confused, but my head soon cleared and I got down to the business at hand. For this entire trip I have lived by the adage, ""If you're going to hike slow, you have to hike long."" It's rare for me to have a day where I get in early enough to have hours of free time. Although I love hiking, today was a very pleasant change of pace.  I plan on getting up early tomorrow for pancakes and coffee before heading for Kay Wood Shelter, 17.5 miles to the north. Joe and his group have about a six mile day to wrap up their three-day trip. I have really enjoyed being included in their group.  It's been a very enjoyable day, and I look forward to continuing on tomorrow. Only a few more days, and I will be hiking with Becky.  It's been four months ago today since I left home to begin this venture, and I am amazed how fast the time has flown, and all at the speed of walking.","Shaker Campsite

My alarm went off at 5:00, and I was packed and almost ready to go at 6:30 when I entered the cabin and got my cup of coffee.  While the coffee might not have lasted very long, Ken, the Appalachian Trail House of Pancakes King, kept churning out those blueberry flapjacks until everyone had eaten all they wanted.  It was a fun event, and I'm glad I was there to participate. I had a relatively long day ahead (17.6 miles), so I wanted to get an early start. I bade the backpacking group farewell and told them I wanted to know if any of them ever decided to thru hike.  I told Joe goodbye, and we promised to keep in touch.  I then headed up the access trail to cover the half mile back to the AT.  On the way out, I noticed a labeled American Chestnut tree that was taller than I was and didn't contain a dead stalk in the middle.  I was told that it is one of the genetically altered chestnut trees that I learned about during Trail Days.  The tree is 15/16ths American Chestnut and 1/16th Chinese Chestnut. The hope is to repopulate the eastern forests with these trees, that will be immune to the blight.  This was the first of these hybrids that I have seen.  I was back on the AT by 8:00.  The weather was perfect for hiking and remained that way all day. Except for the last 0.3 miles before the Kay Wood Shelter, the trail was easily hikable (sometimes I wonder if they don't truck in rocks to place on the trail prior to camping areas).  The trail today was comprised of some rocks and roots (lots of roots) and some muddy areas, but overall the trail was quite reasonable all day, and I made good time.  There weren't any views from overlooks, although the trail did wind its way through a variety of woodlands and swampy areas.  It passed Finerty Pond, another beautiful lake-sized body of water.  I met several people today. Pink Man is a sobo thru hiker whom I met early in the day. He was very upbeat and personable and passed along some good tips for when I reach the Whites. I told him about Upper Goose Pond Cabin.  We wished each other well and hiked on.  I met Milk Shake just past the summit of Becket Mountain. I planned on stopping near the summit to send some texts and to call Becky to confirm some information about her upcoming visit. Milk Shake told me she had been consistently climbing upward and, thus, confirmed I had reached the top. We chatted briefly and she asked me where I was from.  She literally jumped for joy when I said south central Missouri (pronounced properly as Missourah).  She is from Mount Vernon near Springfield, and I was the first person from ""home"" that she had seen on the trail. JP happened by at the time, and we explained some of the benefits of the Show Me State to my New York friend, and he took our picture together. Milk Shake is one of the few hikers I have met from my home state, and her excitement over meeting me was heartwarming. Happy Trails to my fellow Missourian!  I was almost to October Mountain Shelter when I met Earl. I could tell by his clippers and limb saw that he was a trail maintainer.  As I've said before,  these unsung heroes are essential to the trail. Earl told me that he began as a maintainer when he joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts as a chemistry professor in 1954. I told him that I wouldn't do the math to calculate his age, but that he was amazing. He informed me that there used to be three separate groups that cared for the trail in this region, and that he was originally a Metawampe from UMass. He was very personable and informative. When I asked if I could take his picture, he agreed since he had just gotten his hair cut.  Thank you for all your years of volunteer service to the trail, Earl, and I hope you have many more years of trail care ahead of you. I ate lunch at October Mountain Shelter and then continued on to Washington Mountain Road and the home of the Cookie Lady.  The Cookie Lady has been baking cookies for hikers for years and also invites them to eat blueberries from the hundreds of blueberry bushes on her farm.  Unfortunately, she wasn't home when I got there, but I filled my water bottles and ate some blueberries.  With nearly six miles left to go for the day I hiked on, confident that I would be in camp well before dark. As we head toward autumn and hike steadily northward, this will continue to be a growing problem as night continues to come earlier.  On the way up Warner Hill, I saw an AT geographic marker driven into the middle of the trail.  Well worn by years of being trod upon, the year it was placed there was still plainly visible: 1977.  That's the year I graduated high school and already knew I would thru hike someday. Perhaps the marker has been waiting for me.  And perhaps not, as it didn't appear to be sentient.  I was coming off of Warner Hill when I met Steven and Gail and their dog, Ziza, as they picked wild blueberries alongside the trail.  It's funny where conversations can lead.  Steven asked if I was a thru hiker.  ""Yes, I am."" He asked me my trail name.  ""Stick in the Woods."" He responds with a corny riddle. ""What's brown and sticky?"" My years as a Cubmaster are not wasted. ""A stick.""  I counter with, ""What do you call a boomerang that doesn't come back?""  Steven replies, ""Also a stick."" We all laugh at our ready wit, and I prepare to tell them my favorite corny riddle. However, I preface it with a question important to understanding the riddle, ""Do you know anything about Star Trek?""  It was on.  Steven and Gail are both as enamored with Star Trek as I am.  We had an incredible time discussing our favorite episodes and favorite series (they prefer Next Generation). We touched on every series, however,  and brought up episodes from all of them. I have a good friend back home who is also an unabashed Trekkie, and we meet for lunch once a month to discuss whatever, but it is very often Star Trek.  My children and wife are also big fans. I proudly claim the title of Star Trek Geek.  We talked for a good long while, at least the better part of thirty minutes, until I finally had to move on to make it to camp before dark.  We parted with a hearty, Live Long and Prosper. I had walked perhaps a hundred yards when I realized I hadn't asked them the riddle that triggered the entire conversation. I called back, ""How many ears does Captain Kirk have?"" They didn't know. ""He has three.  A left ear, a right ear, and a final-front-ear!""  With that, I moved on.  I did make it to camp a bit before 7:30 and had time to set up camp before dark. Many old acquaintances are here, some whom I haven't seen in months. Yeti, Huggables, Dean, and Patch were cooking dinner when I arrived. I also saw Cow Girl. Except for Patch, I hadn't seen any of them since before Damascus. It's always fun to run into hikers you have met earlier. JP is also here, and he is excited about meeting his family tomorrow in Dalton.  I had to finish dinner by headlamp, but I was still in bed by 9:00. A cold rain is forecast for late tomorrow morning.  I talked it over with Gravity, and the plan is to leave early tomorrow morning to try to make it to the town of Dalton before the storm. We can then eat lunch and resupply for two days while we wait out the storm. It will then be on to Cheshire, a small town eight miles north. A local church allows hikers to tent in their yard. It's only a few more days until I meet Becky in Bennington. She flies out on the eighth and we meet up on the tenth. After four months we will have so much to catch up on that Star Trek, one of our regular topics, probably won't come up. Bed time now.  Live long, and prosper.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

I was awake and moving a bit after 5:30 this morning, as I wanted to get an early start so I could at least be as far as Dalton when the scheduled storm hit. I talked to a few hikers who were taking a zero today in a hotel room to wait out the upcoming storm.  It was chilly,  but the sky looked surprisingly clear.  I was on the trail by 7:00 and covered the three miles to Dalton at a good pace on good trail, arriving in town by 8:30.  Dalton is a pretty town with lots of nice homes.  The trail goes right down several streets.  One house had a sign with distances to Springer and Katahdin displayed.  I passed another house and noticed a group of hikers gathered around a picnic table with perhaps ten tents pitched in the yard behind them. There was a gentleman with a large black cat sitting with the hikers.  This was Tom, who for years has let hikers sleep in his backward and has provided help and assistance to them. I read last year that he had decided to stop, due to the large number and questionable behavior of some of the hikers. When I purchased my guidebook before my trip, I checked and found that, indeed, his name was removed from services offered to hikers in Dalton. Tom explained that he hasn't stopped, but by removing his name, the number of hikers staying in his yard has dropped to a manageable number. His location is noted by a discreet dot on the Dalton map in the guidebook.  Although I didn't stay with him, I am thrilled that this incredibly generous man is still in the business of assisting hikers. Well met, Tom, and thank you again. JP arrived while I was talking with Tom, and we walked together through Dalton. We passed an old paper mill, with a large splash dam. It was an impressive sight watching the river cascade over the dam. I assumed the mill was no longer in service, but that proved to be incorrect. As i later walked out of town, I chatted with a Dalton resident who was trimming his yard.  He told me the paper mills in Dalton produce the paper onto which our nation's currency is printed.  No tours and no free samples.  After passing the mill, JP and I walked to the Dalton Restaurant, where I had coffee,  orange juice, and an everything omelet. I confused our server when I asked her what was on the everything omelet.  ""Everything,"" she replied.  It was delicious. There was a sign that said to seat yourself, so it was by sheer chance that JP and I chose the booth labeled ""Pig Pen,"" which contained numerous little pig statuettes on a shelf above the booth. Gravity joined us a bit later, and we all had a fantastic breakfast. JP remained in Dalton to meet his family who was coming to visit, while Gravity and I continued on to Cheshire. The eight plus miles of trail between the two towns was pretty easy peasy, and we made good time. There was an occasional light drizzle, but the forecasted storm never materialized while we were hiking.  The view from The Cobbles of the Hoosic River Valley with the town of Cheshire below and Mount Greylock in the distance was first rate. Rain still threatened when I entered town, so I immediately headed to the St. Mary of the Assumption Church, which allows hikers to camp on the lawn adjacent to their Parrish Hall.  They also allow use of the hall during the day and evening hours. I set up my tent near the beautiful church and visited with other hikers in the hall. After Gravity arrived,  we walked down to Diane's Twist, a small establishment right along the trail that features sandwiches, drinks,  and ice cream. I had a meatball sub, chips, and a Gatorade. I also purchased a chocolate shake to go.  Although it was getting chilly, and I was shivering a bit as I drank my shake, it was so worth it. Miss Diane was very friendly and personable and helps make the day of many hikers as they first walk into Cheshire. Gravity and I then walked to the Dollar General to resupply. I'm very excited that my next resupply will be with Becky in Bennington.  Mount Greylock stands between Cheshire and Bennington, and that will be for tomorrow.  The rain came in earnest this evening, but I was dry and sorting resupply in the Parrish Hall l when it came. It was misting when I went to my tent to go to bed.  The rocks will be wet and slick tomorrow, and my shoes have just about given up the ghost (Becky is bringing my new pair on Thursday), so I'll be taking my time on Mount Greylock, which is the first large mountain we've climbed in quite some time. In two days I'll be in Vermont, and in three days I'll see Becky. Life is good here on the AT.","Kay Wood Shelter Tent Site

The rain stopped during the night, and everything remained dry except for the outside walls of my tent. I got started early, since I was a bit concerned about the long ascent of Mount Greylock, especially with the condition of my shoes. I knew the rocks and roots would be wet and slick, and that there would be lots of places where the trail would be muddy.  I was on trail by 7:10. I began by hiking out of Cheshire and then began a steep ascent up the outermost edge of Mount Greylock.  Although I was correct about slick and mud, climbing Mount Greylock was quite enjoyable. The temperature was cool,  and the trail wasn't usually very steep. In fact, a few times I thought I might have gotten turned around, since I kept running into rather lengthy descents. The trail went through several marshy areas, and while slogging through sticky, black mud was in order, the trail oftentimes provided a raised boardwalk over the worst of the areas.  These boards can also be treacherously slick, and after nearly falling once, I made sure I used my trekking poles for balance.  I stopped to photograph a set of boards when along came Homeward Bound to photobomb my picture.  From Maine (hence his trail name), I met Homeward Bound quite some time back, and hadn't seen him for awhile. We've become reacquainted the past few days. He is a very friendly, outgoing young man, and we hiked together for a bit both this morning and afternoon.  Upon arriving later than expected to the campsite tonight,  he helped Gravity and I find tent spots.  He's another hiker with whom I've exchanged contact information.  Nearing the top of Mount Greylock, I encountered a beautiful little pond with a small shed located across from the trail. As I wàs taking a picture,  I was rather boisterously introduced to Jackson and Hero, who came bounding by me to jump excitedly into the pond.  They were followed closely by their humans, who tried to apologize.  Of course, there was nothing to apologize for, and all five of us continued up the trail to the summit. For nearly the next mile, I had me a trail dog. For some reason, Jackson took a shine to me and walked with me nearly the entire rest of the way up the mountain.  I regret I wasn't able to get his picture, since he, Hero, and the very nice people he was with went a separate way when we reached the summit.  Jackson was one of the cutest dogs I have ever met. A Golden Retriever/Daschund mix, he has the stocky body of a retriever but short, little legs. Perhaps he sensed another short legged person, and that is why he befriended me. I have a good friend back home, who is also blessed with short legs, who would have also loved Jackson.  The tower on the summit of Mount Greylock is spectacular.  I read that the beacon on its top can be seen from over seventy miles away. The clouds had dissipated somewhat as I climbed the ninety circular steps to the top. I had a good view in one direction,  but northward, where I am headed, was still shrouded in clouds, so I was unable to get sneak peek at Vermont.  After descending the tower, I headed over to the Lodge Restaurant and had a sirloin burger, cole slaw, and potato salad. A few hours later, I pretty much devoured the lunch I had in my pack for today, and was hungry again for supper.  Hiker hunger has a hold on me now. While I was eating,  I received a phone call from Dennis, a good friend from back home. It was great to talk to him, and he told me he has been following my adventures and misadventures daily. He and his family have been great friends for many years, and we don't see enough of each other. One of my retirement goals, more important than the good whiskey and cheap cheeseburger ones, is to spend more time visiting friends and family. Yes, a trip to House Springs is in order. Yet there is still that small matter of 600 more miles to Katahdin first.  I also got a text from Becky. She arrived safely in Burlington, and we'll be meeting up in just two days. After first lunch, I got back on the trail. While shorter in miles, the descent of Greylock made up for this in increased difficulty.  The trail was very steep, slick, and clogged with rocks, roots, and muddy patches.  My shoes, while wet and muddy, held together. There was one ascent past Greylock to a smaller mountain, Mount Williams.  It afforded a beautiful view and a comfortably rock overlook.  This is where I ate my second lunch and chilled out for awhile, lying on my back and watching the clouds.  It was incredibly peaceful.  Soon enough, I was back to working my way down to North Adams, a very tidy town that the AT passes through.  Gravity and I walked through a residential area, crossed  the Hoosac River on a footbridge adorned with thousands of painted handprints,  and prepared to re-enter the woods.  The AT goes right up a personal driveway, and the owner of the home thoughtfully provides a hose next to some beautiful bushes, with a note inviting all hikers to get water. I took advantage of the offer before beginning the 1.2 mile ascent to the campsite.  True to form, the trail was extremely rocky as it neared the camping area.  I arrived to find very few open spots.  This is when Homeward Bound helped me out. I quickly made camp and prepared for bed.  I talked with Gravity, and we have decided to push all the way to Bennington tomorrow. That way, he and I can share a hotel room tomorrow night, and I will already be in town when Becky arrives on the 10th. She and I will then begin our hike on the 11th, and I'll be all decked out in new shoes. I'm even more excited about sharing part of this adventure with my very special daughter. We'll be hiking in Vermont, which I reach tomorrow.","Cheshire, MA. Backyard of St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church

After talking it over with Gravity, I decided it would be a good idea to push all the way to Bennington today and simply take a zero in town tomorrow. That way, I will already have a room and wouldn't have to worry about check-in times and the like. Bennington was 16.8 miles away, so I planned an early departure from camp and a steady day of hiking to get to town as soon as possible.  I was on the trail at 7:00.  There was a very steep climb early on that involved boulder scrambling and some hands and feet action.  It has been awhile since I encountered such trail, and although it was time consuming, it was a fun challenge. Near the top, I passed the junction with the Pine Cobble Trail. I looked at my guidebook page and noticed that I had traveled 1594.9 miles and had 594.9 to go.  At that point, I had traveled exactly 1000 miles further than I had to go.  The trail became less steep, and I soon found myself at the Massachusetts/Vermont border.  Homeward Bound arrived a few minutes later and took my picture.  The AT and the Long Trail will share trail space for the next 105 miles before heading their separate ways. I set a bit of Beau free in our twelfth state and said farewell to Massachusetts.  Vermont is often called Vermud in AT parlance, and it didn't take long to see why. While I have encountered muddy patches in every state, there seems to be quite a bit more mud in Vermont. I could see that it is often worse than now, as I walked on the ground alongside large stones set a pace apart down the middle of the trail. Other times, I walked on such stones through muddy areas. There were also places where long lines of planks have been placed, as I have seen in other states. I encountered some corduroy trail with small logs placed side by side by side to form a bumpy, but less muddy, section.  Many times there were no options but to trudge through the mud. Today is the last day for my present pair of shoes. It's a shame to think of my brand new shoes being introduced to the mud, but such are the realities of the trail. Despite the mud, rocks, and roots, I made pretty good time. I met another trail maintainer today. Crapper Trapper, who earned his unique trail name years ago when he was called upon to pack an old, iron toilet ring out of the woods during a clean up detail, was walking southbound toward the Massachusetts border. I enjoyed his tale about his trail name and thanked him for his service to the trail as we went our opposite ways. I passed a beautiful little pond and then entered a long stretch of plank boardwalk across a marshy area near it. I opted not to get water from the stream that ran from it. The stream seemed clear enough, but I always prefer to get water from springs or from streams that don't initiate from standing water. There was such a stream a few miles past the pond, and I made it there with a small amount of water left. While walking along one plank walk today, I saw a large number of snakes. Most slithered away when they noted my presence, but one pair remained long enough for me to get a photo. I'm not sure what type of snake they are, but I walked carefully to make sure I didn't step on one. It is their home, after all. Nearing the end of the day, I hiked along a very pretty creek for over a mile before turning uphill toward Harmon Hill. For over a mile, the trail was a very challenging combination of rocks, roots, and mud. I did my best at the disjointed jitterbug, and often felt like a candidate for the Ministry of Silly Walks, the delightfully silly sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus that I loved as a youth (and, truth be known, as an adult). I ended up stepping ankle deep in a muddy soup on several occasions, as I waited for trail conditions to improve.  Which they did, and I enjoyed a much easier walk for the last several miles of today's hike. I paused awhile at the top of Harmon Hill. The sun was glaring on the mist below, partially obstructing the view. I'll bet there was a great sunset to be seen from there this evening, but I was unable to stick around for it. Gravity met me there, and we continued to the top of the ridge above Highway 9. As instructed,  I called the hotel for a shuttle before beginning the very steep 0.6 mile descent. It was a rather unnerving descent, and I again joked to myself about coping stones. I made it to the bottom without incident, and the shuttle soon arrived to take us to the Catamount Hotel.  The Catamount has a reputation for being very hiker friendly and has lived up to its reputation so far. They do your laundry for $4.00 and, while I look a bit silly in my tie-dyed flowery shirt and leggings (the only clothes I could find in my size in the clothing box), it is a great feeling to be clean. Becky arrives tomorrow from Burlington, and we'll spend the day in Bennington seeing the town and getting supplies for our hike to Manchester Center. I am so excited to see her and to get to share part of this experience with her.  We will hike out of town the morning of the 11th. The first order of business will be the climb out of the valley.  Ah, the ups and downs of life on the trail.","Pete's Spring/Sherman Brook Campsite

I was awake and ready to get moving at 5;30, even though there was no reason to be. I was very excited about Becky arriving today to join me on the trail for several days. To stay busy,  I quietly sorted out my paperwork, organizing what I still needed to keep and what I could send home.  I then sorted out my food bag to determine what I would need to resupply for four days.  Homeward Bound was up soon after I was, since he intended to be on the 8:00 shuttle to the trail.  Gravity enjoyed some extra rest and slept on.  Becky's bus was due in at 11:30, and I planned on meeting her at the station.  I didn't want to wake Gravity to get his clothes to take to the office to get laundered,  but there was no way I was wearing my borrowed flowery shirt and leggings to the bus terminal. i do have standards, after all.  Just in case, I pulled my town clothes out of my pile. Fortunately, Gravity soon woke up, and I took our laundry to the front desk.  Pete promised to have it back to me in plenty of time. I spent a leisurely few hours going through my gear. I ate leftover pizza for breakfast. True to his word, Pete had my clothes back to me before 11:00.  I quickly changed and, now dressed in my worn but clean hiking attire, went to meet Becky. The Green Mountain Express bus line appears to be quite an operation. We would take advantage of the fifty cent fare later in the day to get to Wal-Mart for supplies.  For now, the bus was right on time, and I enjoyed a joyous reunion with my wonderful daughter in the parking lot. My glasses were hanging from my strap, and our first hug bent the temples backwards. Luckily, I was able to bend them back. Our second hug somehow opened a sore on Becky's ear.  So, in true Smith fashion, we stood in a public parking lot with twisted frames and a bloody ear. No matter, and we headed back to the hotel.  I got turned around a bit after going to an ATM at the bank, and we briefly walked the wrong way down Main Street. Unfortunately, there were no sticks and woods with which to fashion direction arrows. There is a nifty compass painted on the road at the intersection of Main and Benmont Avenues that I later used to get my bearings. We stopped by the Post Office on the way back to the hotel to get a shipping box. There were a few things I wouldn't need that I wanted to send home. I included my worn out shoes just because. In addition to my new shoes, Becky brought me a replacement belt for my pack, as the one I have been using was tearing where it connected to the pack bag. It might have lasted to Katahdin, but I didn't want to take any chances, so I had ZPacks send me a free replacement belt home so Becky could bring it. With the help of an instructional video on YouTube, I was soon sporting a brand new pack belt. Becky met Gravity, and the three of us walked back to the Post Office and then went to Cilantros, a burrito restaurant that came highly recommended.  I enjoyed a huge seasoned chicken burrito.  We then returned to the bus terminal to catch the Red Line to Wal-Mart. After obtaining four days of supplies, which should get us to at least Manchester Center, we waited at the bus stop for our return trip. We had almost a forty-five minute wait, but the time passed quickly while we talked. I found a shady spot in the grass and sat down to wait.  We returned to the hotel, where we sorted food and worked on packing. After a short nap, we rejoined Gravity and walked to the Madison Brew Company for dinner.  We had a great dinner with good food, good craft beer, and dessert. Becky and Gravity are both in the media buainess, so they had a great deal in common which led to interesting conversation. I had a touch of stomach distress, the first health issue I've had since my blister back in the Smokies. Fortunately, it soon passed, and I was already feeling better by the time we reached the hotel. We were getting ready for bed, when Becky remembered we had purchased Permethrine to treat our clothes one last time. She went to get Gravity, and we took care of that. We realized that this was the last time we would need to take this preventative measure against ticks. It was then time for bed. We will catch the 8:00 shuttle back to the trailhead in the morning.  The first thing will be a steep, two mile climb out of the valley as we climb Little Pond Mountain. Homeward Bound has hiked this part of the AT before,  and it is one of his favorites, with great views and two fire towers to clumb. I'm very excited about being able to hike with Becky the next several days, and we'll get that all going tomorrow.","VT 9, Bennington, VT

I had another vivid dream of hiking along a wooded trail, only to wake up totally bumfuzzled in a hotel room. I soon reoriented myself and slept well the rest of the night. Becky and I were both up in plenty of time to prepare for the early shuttle back to the trailhead.  Pete gave us a lift, along with Gravity.  We thanked him again for all that he does for hikers.  He told us that four years ago, only one hiker stayed at the Catamount, but this year there have been over four hundred hiker-nights at the hotel. He added that some hotels don't like to take in hikers, but that he finds us friendly, appreciative, and we only stink until we shower and get our laundry done. I can't say enough good things about Pete, Alan, and the Catamount Hotel.  Thanks again, guys!  We were on the trail by 8:45.  Early on, we crossed City Stream on a handsome, iron footbridge and then began the 6.5 mile ascent of Little Pond Mountain, increasing our elevation by 2,000 feet.  After a small descent, we tacked on an additional 450 feet as we completed the climb to the top of Glastenbury Mountain.  The trail along the way was quite reasonable, with its fair share of rocks, roots, and mud, but nothing outrageous.  We stopped for lunch prior to the summit, and I enjoyed a short catnap before we completed the climb.  Becky did well, and the time went by quickly as she filled me in on news from home, details of her day in Burlington, and the fact that the next doctor on Doctor Who will be a woman.  We called Sandy during lunch to let her know how we were doing and to get a cat update (Sandy is cat-sitting Pip and Dana, Becky's pair of feline companions). We then completed our trek up Glastenbury Mountain.  The summit is home to the Glastenbury Mountain Lookout Tower. Constructed in 1927, the tower has undergone recent renovation and is in wonderful shape. Unlike most of these towers, you can climb into the observation deck for 360 degrees views. I am so pleased that the decision was made   to renovate and not remove the tower. Without it, Glastenbury would just be another mountain with a viewless summit. Instead, there are views of mountains in all directions. Looking down on the fir trees that surround the tower also adds a very unique perspective. A light, misty rain began to fall while we were on the tower, and I'm sure the views are far more grand in clear weather.  My original thought was to stop at the shelter prior to the summit and call it a ten mile day. Becky was feeling great, so we decided to add an additional 4.3 miles and continue on to Kid Gore Shelter.  We paused at Goddard Shelter to get water at the nicest water source I've seen in quite some time and to use the privy. Some budding poet has penned a long tale, told in Dr. Suess style, on the inside wall of the privy. It tells of a northbound and a southbound Zax, both of whom refuse to yield the right of way. They remain stubbornly rooted on the trail until they are both paved over by highway construction.  The flies in the privy were numerous and the odor was odorous, so I did not hang around to copy down the poem. So if you want to read this cautionary tale, you will need to hike up to Goddard Shelter yourself.  We continued to make good time and arrived at Kid Gore Shelter at 6:30.  It is located in a very rocky area with few tent sites, but a hiker at the shelter clued us in on a very nice tent site, just big enough for two tents. We set up camp, cooked dinner, and prepared to go to sleep. Our little campsite sits right by the valley that the shelter overlooks, and the sunrises here are reportedly glorious.  Unfortunately, it began raining soon after we went to bed, which will probably put a damper on the sunrise scene, as well as undoubtedly add to our fun tomorrow with wetter rocks, slicker roots, and sloppier mud. We now plan on covering fifteen miles tomorrow, which will put us into Manchester Center the day after that. It is wonderful to have Becky hiking with me to share part of this adventure. She'll hike four more days with me before we both head up to Burlington to spend a day with Becky's best high school friend. I'm now being lulled back to sleep by the sound of rain on the tent.  It's a beautiful sound but will make for a ""One Mud, Two Mud. In Mud, Through Mud"" kind of day tomorrow. Alas for my brand new shoes.","VT 9, Bennington, VT (Catamount Hotel)

One March day, several weeks before I left to undertake this adventure, I was working as a lunch volunteer at St.Patrick's Catholic School, where Sandy worked as the third grade teacher. She came to see me during her lunch time and began explaining to one of the other parents some of the details involved in a thru hike. This woman stared at me with growing incredulity and finally exclaimed, ""And, Dean, you are doing this . . . on purpose?""  Today was one of those days that the uninitiated might use to explain her disbelief.  I woke up at 5:30 to the sound of heavy rain on the tent. I decided it made no sense to get up yet, and dozed back off, hoping the rain might subside.  I woke back up at 6:30 to discover that the rain had, indeed, ceased. Becky and I got moving and had camp broken down and were ready for the trail at 8:00.  For fun, I took a photo of the white mist to the east, where we might have enjoyed a beautiful sunrise view on another day.  As we began hiking, we soon discovered that Vermont definitely deserves her reputation of mud capitol of the AT.  For several miles we trudged along over trail that consisted of hundreds of black, muddy patches. Some were thick and sticky, but most consisted of a soupy, black slurry that soon covered our shoes and our pants legs nearly to our knees.  There were places where rocks were embedded in the mud, making it somewhat possible to step from rock to rock to reduce the contact with the mud, but these were inconsistent and very slick as well.  Numerous times my foot slipped from the stone and then slurped into the mud anyway.  These conditions pretty much defined the trail for the first eight miles. We then began the 3.4 mile ascent up Stratton Mountain.  The mud gradually subsided as we climbed.  And climbed.  The trail never got very steep as we added 1,700 feet to our elevation, but for some reason the climb seemed relentless.  Becky had pretty much decided that the summit and its accompanying lookout tower was a myth when we finally reached the top. I explained to her that if you keep following the white blazes, you will eventually reach your destination. Stratton Mountain is famous as the place where Benton MacKaye was first inspired to create the Appalachian Trail.  As we reached the summit, we were greeted by Hugh and Jeanne, the caretakers. Hugh has worked on the summit of Stratton Mountain for fifty years, first as a fire lookout and then as the caretaker.  He and Jeanne share a small building built in the 1920s. Hugh was very personable and informative.  He and Jeanne, his wife, work 24 hours a day, five days a week, and then have two days off. They work May to October. Employed by the Green Mountain Club, who also maintain the Vermont Long Trail, they add a very human touch to visiting Stratton Mountain, which sees a great deal of visitors, because it can also be reached via a gondola system (which we did not see). It had been partly cloudy for most of the day, but an ominous sky had been gathering as we finished our climb. The views from the lookout tower were still stunning, but we would have seen more had we been there earlier. We heard the first rumblings of thunder as we were descending the tower. We quickly began the three mile descent to Stratton Pond, where there is a shelter.  We were half way there when the thunderstorm hit. We hiked in heavy rain for about forty-five minutes, which also helped add to the mud we again were encountering. The rain slackened to a drizzle when we reached Stratton Pond Shelter. Gravity, Becky, and I discussed staying there while at the lookout tower for a few reasons. One was obviously the weather. Also, the tenting area was 0.5 miles off trail. Becky and I reached the shelter first and went to check it out. At the shelter, which is a large building with bunks below and a loft above, we met Chris (trail name, Varsity), the caretaker for the cabin. Also employed by the Green Mountain Club, Chris lives in a platform tent by the shore of Stratton Pond.  Chris thru hiked in 2015 and left his job in Seattle to get closer to nature and to give back to the trail that he loves.  He told me his tent by the pond is the nicest place he will ever live.  The shelter he oversees is well-kept and includes a large, covered cooking and gathering area. An old friend, Skywalker, and two new friends, Beanie and Spills, were cooking dinner when we arrived. I decided to add sleeping in a shelter to my list of AT accomplishments, and Becky, Gravity, and I are the sole inhabitants of the loft tonight. Becky and I needed water, so we headed down to the pond as the evening wanned. The sun was setting over Stratton Pond and, while we may have missed the sunrise this morning, we were blessed with witnessing a beautiful sunset tonight. We watched a beaver swim across the pond (the first one I've seen this trip).  Thunder resumed as we finished filtering our water, and we walked back to the shelter in the dark and in a heavy rain.  We cooked dinner, hung our food, and toted our gear into the loft.  I dozed off to the sound of rain on the metal roof, before waking to write this entry. I just heard coyotes howling in the distance as I prepare to go back to sleep. My new shoes which I will, of course, be putting back on in the morning are a muddy mess, as are my pants and socks. I'm sure we will again experience even more of Vermont's finest mud tomorrow as we hike to Manchester Center.

Becky awoke this morning to find that she apparently now has a trail name.  I'm afraid I inadvertently caused the situation that led to her new moniker. I didn't write about it last night, but we had a small misadventure with her stove. She borrowed it from Stephen, and I'm afraid I may have added a wee bit too much alcohol to its fuel reservoir last night.  It was already dark when we started cooking, and I filled her stove by the light of a headlamp. Everything was fine until just after the water boiled, when all of a sudden the stove became enveloped in a ball of flame.  Those who know me understand that mishaps with stoves are not an uncommon occurence, and I asked Becky to put on the snuffer as soon as she patted out the small areas of flame. Unfortunately, the snuffer had no effect, and my next course of action was of questionable effectiveness.  Specifically, I tried blowing out the flames. This had a less than positive response, as the alcohol flared up and lightly singed my beard. Except for smelling a bit like burned feathers for a bit, there was no harm done. The pyrotechnics actually appeared far more spectacular than they were.  I took my water bottle and wet down the table around the stove and waited for it to exhaust its fuel. No harm, no foul. However,  Becky is now being addressed as Torch. Works for me if it works for her. The rain ceased during the night, and we hiked today under a clear sky. The mud was bad early on, but there was not nearly as much as yesterday. We disturbed a little, green frog as we slogged by his home. One hiker commented on the state of the trail in these parts, maintaining that they were actually ponds supporting aquatic life. I commented that we should be glad that we are encountering a very muddy season because it gives us future bragging rights.  Apparently, last year was a dry year and the mud situation was greatly reduced.  We, however, can forever claim that we survived the muddy year of 2017.  I always told my Boy Scouts that you don't want everything to always go well, because then you will have no future stories to tell. That being said, by the third time my foot slipped into the slurry past my ankle, and I felt the cold, muddy soup fill my ahoe, I was content that I had enough material for bragging rights and was ready for drier trail.  Which we soon got. The last few miles to Prospect Rock, and the entire trail between there and Highway 11/30 were much less muddy.  We actually hiked for over a half mile on an old gravel road to get to Prospect Rock.  The view from Prospect Rock was beautiful. This being Sunday, we encountered numerous day hikers, as we also did yesterday.  I was again taken with how obviously clean they smell. I mentioned this phenomenon at the shelter last night, and Beanie had the perfect term for clean-smelling hikers.  She calls them Laundry Comets. No improvement possible on that term.  Becky and I made excellent time to the highway and relaxed in the shade until Gravity arrived. We then stuck out our thumbs. Within a few minutes, a woman, whose son thru hiked a few years previously, stopped and gave us a lift to Manchester Center. We had her drop us off, with many thanks, at Mountain Goat Outfitters. Unfortunately, Gravity was unsuccessful in his search for a new pack, but I was able to get the tips on my trekking poles replaced.  Manchester Center is a fascinating place with many shops.  Becky and I went to the bookstore, as we were told they had a public restroom. While the store front is small, the book store is huge, going back away from the street and up to a second story. I was amazed at how large a store it was and, as I climbed the staircase to the juvenile section, commented that it was magical like something out of Harry Potter. Becky then pointed out the four large banners hanging along the stairs: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin.  Too cool. Becky bought a few postcards and commented that she could spend all of her time and all of her money there. After getting what we could at the outfitters, we headed for Price Chopper for a bit of resupply and then to McDonald's so Becky could get fries and a vanilla shake. I countered with a Big Mac meal and a chocolate shake. We then headed for Fireflys, a highly recommended restaurant/tap room. There we met up with two of my favorite people on the trail, Pippi and Mechanic. Pippi had texted me that they were also in Manchester Center, and that they very much wanted to meet Becky. We had a wonderful, often silly, time at dinner. We opted to eat outside due to olfactory issues, but our fabulous server/bartender, Jamie, invited us inside after all the other patrons had left. We stayed a bit longer and then Gravity texted Jen to come and take us to her home. Jen, a friendly and outgoing person, has very recently opened her home for thru hikers to spend the night. She is not yet mentioned in AWOL's guidebook but is in Guthooks. She treated us wonderfully, and I am presently showered and resting in a very comfortable bed. Coffee and coffee cake await me in the morning.  Jen and I talked this evening, and she is also a teacher of students with special needs. We could have talked all night, but hiker midnight (actually hiker 1:00 am) rolled around, and everyone headed for bed. We'll get a ride back to the trailhead early in the morning. Becky can hike for two more days, and we are heading for Wallingsford, which is twenty-five miles to the north. From there it will be in to Burlington to visit Becky's friend, Julia, where, for at least one day, I can be a Laundry Comet, too.","Stratton Pond Shelter

Gravity, Becky, and I shared Jen's home last night with Van Man and his son, Darren. Like me, Van Man dreamed of hiking the AT for years.  He has a friend who was going to do it with him.  After a practice trek, reality set in with his friend,  who decided that this whole thru hiking business wasn't for him (""And you're doing this . . . on purpose?""). Up stepped Darren, who apparently inherited the AT bug from his dad, and the two of them are hiking the trail in a unique fashion. Van Man hikes every day, but they work out their itinerary so that he also drives a support vehicle as they walk their way northward. I've camped with them several times now, and the relationship between father and son is heartwarming.  We had a great visit last night before we all called hiker midnight and headed for bed. It was easy to sleep well in a clean bed next to an open window, and I slept in until 6:30. As promised, there was coffee ready to start and a delicious coffee cake waiting in the kitchen.  We all packed up in a focused but leisurely fashion. Van Man offered to drive us back to the trailhead. After thanking Jen again, we all piled into his van. The first stop was McDonald's, where I fueled my hiking engine with two Egg McMuffins. Van Man then dropped us off on the way to their destination. At the trailhead, we met Skywalker and Spills, who were also returning from town.  The ebb and flow of hikers I encounter continues, as I meet new hikers and lose touch with others, only to hopefully see them later down the trail. Becky and Spills chatted as we prepared to start today's hike. Our first order of business was to climb Bromley Mountain, the first of four peaks we would cross today. The trail was very reasonable and, while often steep, was not terribly rocky and there was very little mud.  The final part of the ascent was walking up a ski slope. A large ski lift is on the summit of Bromley Mountain. Fred Pabst, the grandson of the founder of PBR beer, had the first lift constructed in 1959. A few years later, a wooden tower was built,  which offered a 360 degree view of four states. On a clear day, one could see the Whites in New Hampshire. Unfortunately, the tower was condemned and removed in 2012. Efforts are underway to fund a new tower. The views from the top were still pretty spectacular. Becky and I then hiked down eight hundred feet of elevation to Mad Tom Notch, only to immediately climb nine hundred and fifty feet up to the summit of Skyles Peak.  We ate lunch at the outlook at the top and were joined by Spills, Skywalker, Gravity, and Scunch. Becky (or, Torch, as hikers are now calling her)  and Spills have rapidly formed a trail friendship and swapped contact information.  I took my brief power nap while sunning myself on a large rock. I was pleasantly surprised to be woke up, quite rudely I might add, by none other than my old friend, Extra Mile. Leapfrog, who I saw a few miles later, attended a bridal shower a few days previously, and she and Extra Mile were slackpacking southbound again today. As always, it was great to see them.  Refreshed from lunch, a nap, and a reunion with a friend, I continued onward along the saddle between Skyles Peak and Peru Peak, our third mountain of the day. Becky stayed behind awhile to continue her conversation with Spills but caught up with me near the top of Peru Peak. This part of the woods consisted of very winding trail amongst spruce trees and lots of ferns.  There was a feeling of mystery and age, and the smell of the spruce was strong in the air. I heard the call of some birds that I don't remember hearing before. It was a unique, fascinating place.  After a steep decline from Peru Peak, which was viewless, Becky and I hiked through woods that made us homesick for Missouri. We could have been on the Ozark Trail back home. The miles and time passed by quickly until we reached the ascent to Baker Peak, our last summit of the day. Here, Becky got to experience some true AT rock scrambling, as the ""trail"" consisted of white blazes painted on sharp, ridged, and steeply elevated rock faces. After her initial surprise, she got the hang of it and had soon scrambled her way to the top, where we were rewarded with another view of the mountains in the distance and the valley below.  The sun was getting low in the sky, which made photography diffucult. The view of the sunset from Baker Peak must be spectacular, but we still had a few miles to go, which we wanted to do before dark. We arrived at Lost Pond Shelter a bit after 7:00 and set up camp. We visited with two southbound section hikers and with Scunch. Spills and Skywalker stopped earlier at Griffith Lake to go swimming and camped there.  It was dark by the time we finished dinner (no more misadventures with the stove), hung our food, and went to bed. We will be getting an early start in the morning.  We have a bit over eleven miles to cover tomorrow to get to the road to Wallingford, where we will catch the afternoon bus to Burlington to visit Julia. I'll zero there the next day, before returning on the bus to Wallingford to resume my hike. Dustin, a good friend, who, while a Boy Scout in our troop back home, hiked extensively with our High Adventure group and taught me to fly fish, will be flying out from Denver to hike with me for a few days as I near New Hampshire. As much as I love this trek and making so many new friends,  it is truly special to also be able to share it with family and friends from home.","VT 11 and 30/Manchester Center

I did a rare thing last night and set an alarm.  Becky and I had 11.3 miles to cover to get to Highway 140, and then would need to find a way to the town of Wallingford, 2.8 miles from the trail crossing. From Wallingford, we planned to catch a 4:40 bus to Burlington.  Due to the uncertainty of trail conditions, we wanted as early a start as possible.  After breaking camp and filtering water, we were on the trail by 7:10. The trail was reasonable, and we made good time all day.  We passed Little Rock Pond,  another of the beautiful, lake-sized ponds of which Vermont is rightfully proud.  We met a fairly large frog who was initially skittish about a photo opp. I got a passable photo, but Becky persevered and captured a face-on image that looks incredible.  We hiked on, climbing toward White Rocks Cliff. Along the way, we met Mama Bear and Cub. This mother/daughter duo have been section hiking together for eight years.  They both exuded such joyful personalities that Becky and I were both happy to pause and chat for a bit. Mama Bear told us that the two of them had been best friends for twelve of Cub's twenty-two years.  Cub added that it had cost her mother a piece of toast. Becky and I were perplexed, so they explained that twelve years ago, Cub had not been hungry for dinner and asked her mom to make her a piece of toast instead. ""Why don't you make it yourself?"" was her mom's response. ""If you make it for me, I'll be your best friend for ten years."" What parent could pass up an offer like that, especially when an extra two years got tacked on. To further cement the bond, Cub is presently attending Brown University, whose mascot is a bear. Mama Bear was proudly wearing her Brown University ""Mama Bear"" t-shirt. Cub plans a 2020 thru hike, but she promises to continue section hiking with her mom. It warmed my heart to meet yet another parent/child hiking team, as I returned to climbing the mountain with my favorite daughter.  We were making such good time that we decided to take the 0.2 mile side trail to White Rocks Cliff, where we were rewarded with one of the more spectacular views we have enjoyed in Vermont. We then hiked through a  fascinating section of forest, populated with towering evergreens above and short little evergreens below. It was beautiful to walk through, and the sharp but pleasant odor of spruce permeated the air.     We reached the Highway by 2:00 and thought we might hitch into town. We saw about six cars in fifteen minutes, none of whom stopped  (although most people waved). Perhaps we could have walked to town, but the highway was very curvy with absolutely no shoulder. Besides, it would have added an additional 2.8 miles to the day.  We called Green Mountain Taxi instead and were soon at Cumberland Farms, the gas station in Wallingford from where you catch the bus.  Becky and I thought about exploring the town, but opted instead to remain at Cumberland Farms, where we rested against our packs and consumed slushies, pizza, Gatorade,  and ice cream.  We might have resembled hiker trash, but we were friendly and unobtrusive hiker trash, and the employees and patrons were all very kind and open. The bus arrived right on time, and we enjoyed the three hour ride to Burlington. It rained most of the way, but was only lightly drizzling when we reached our destination of the University of Vermont. This beautiful campus partially resides along Prospect Street. Specifically, North Prospect Street. I guess this explains the street sign on campus that I just had to photograph despite the rain. It reads: NO PROSPECT.  It was a short walk to Becky' friend Julia's apartment. It was good to see her again. Becky brought me ""civilian"" clothes from home, and for the first time in months I was decked out in blue jeans, a cotton t-shirt, and my favorite ball cap. This cap, a gift from Stephen, is a subtle sign to all that a true Star Trek geek resides under it. Every once in awhile, I meet someone who catches the reference to one of my very favorite Deep Space Nine episodes.  ""Go, Niners!"" She also brought my Vessell's t-shirt from my gym at home. It's a good thing that she remembered my belt, since my jeans, a little tight when I left home, seem to have mysteriously grown larger since I left home. Becky and Julia enjoyed catching up with each other before we headed to the local laundromat.  Toting our muddy, stinky clothes in a large trash bag, I headed for the street to begin the walk to the laundromat. Becky and Julia reminded me of another modern-day convenience which I apparently had forgotten: Julia has a car. We spent a relaxing hour washing our clothes and then returned to order pizza at Julia's before heading for bed.  On tomorrow's agenda is climbing Mount Mansfield, Vermont's highest peak (what else for a thru hiker to do on a zero day than climb a mountain), and catching a Vermont Lake Monsters minor league baseball game.  I'll ride the bus back to Wallingford the next day to get back on the trail, clothed in nylon, capilene, and wool. At least I'll be able to pass as a Laundry Comet for a few hours before trail reality sets back in.","Lost Pond Shelter Tent Site

Everyone slept in today, and I got some extra rest. Today is Battle of Bennington Day, a state holiday in Vermont.  Julia was off work for the holiday, so we could share the day with her. A quick reality check informed us that a hike up Mount Mansfield would consume the entire day, so we decided to explore Burlington instead. We walked past blocks of old homes on our way to Church Street, which is closed to vehicular traffic and is home to many trendy shops.  We decided to eat lunch at the Burlington Pub and Brewery, the oldest craft beer pub in the state. The food was delicious, as was the Irish Red beer. We also ordered a Vermont Cheese Plate, which consisted of six different cheeses, ranging from a soft goat cheese to several types of cheddar to a strong blue cheese. They were all excellent.  After lunch, we decided to walk down to the shore of Lake Champlain. We strolled along the shore admiring the large number of boats of all shapes and sizes and the views of the Adirondack Mountains in the distance. There is a very busy walking/biking trail along the shoreline.  It was a nice feeling knowing that, after showering and doing my laundry, I fit right in with all of the Laundry Comets. It's funny, I didn't notice the ""clean effect"" today like I do on the trail. We arrived at a beach and enjoyed watching the antics of several dogs, whose humans were throwing balls and sticks into the lake for them to retrieve.  I settled against a large boulder and took a nap while Becky and Julia continued their exploration of the waterfront. After their return, we walked back toward the main part of town.  We passed an ice cream stand selling Maple Creemees, which are soft-serve maple flavored ice cream cones that are quite yummy. We then worked our way back up Church Street. I resupplied at a CVS store and was able to find most of what I needed.  We spent time in an outfitters shop that not only has a very large selection of outdoor equipment, but also contains a huge consignment shop of used equipment in the basement. It was like the Goodwill of camping stores.  I didn't need anything, and we soon covered the road back to Julia's house. I sorted my resupply and had a relaxing few hours with Becky and Julia before it was time to leave for the Vermont Lake Monsters game.  The Lake Monsters are an A level minor league affiliate of the Oakland As, and they were playing the Lowell Spinners this evening at beautiful, downtown Centennial Field on the University of Vermont campus.  We leisurely strolled for the thirty minute walk to the  stadium, enjoying the cool evening weather, which was perfect for baseball. We paid $7.00 apiece for tickets and sat above the third base line.  We ate baseball food (peanuts, soft pretzels, and Cracker Jack) and drank baseball beer. I had my picture taken by a statue of Champ, their mascot. I bought two Lake Monsters ball caps, and Becky purchased some souvenirs for the folks back home.  The game was wonderful. I am a lifelong baseball fan and especially love minor league games.  It was great fun to watch Champ's antics, and there were silly diversions between every inning.  It was a good game, with the Monsters coming away with a 7-4 victory. I purchased a score card for fifty cents and kept score, teaching Becky a few scoring tips along the way. There was a humorous sign in the restroom at the ballpark, admonishing employees to wash their hands before returning to work. The sign also adds this bit of advice: ""Also, check your shoes for TP . . . That would just be embarrassing."" Perhaps similar signs should be in privies, reminding hikers to use hand sanitizer and to check their shoes for that embarrasing bit of TP. The game ended a bit before 10:00, and we walked back to Julia's. Becky and I packed everything for tomorrow. I'll catch a 7:30 bus back to Wallingford and should be back on the trail by 11:00.  I have a four day push into Hanover, New Hampshire, where I will meet up with my friend, Dustin, who will then hike with me for three days. He is flying in from Denver to share a part of my adventure. It has been trully wonderful hiking with Becky and then sharing this very special zero day in Burlington with her and Julia.Becky and I will share the bus briefly until she gets off at the Burlington airport. We won't be separated for too much longer, however, as I continue to close in on Katahdin and the conclusion of this little ""Walk in the Woods.""  And, I'll be home for post season action.","VT 140/Wallingford, VT

I woke up this morning fifteen minutes before my 5:45 alarm, got dressed, and did my final packing. After thanking Julia and giving these two dear friends a chance to say goodbye, I left with Becky for the bus stop. There was no established fee for the twenty minute ride across Burlington to the airport, but the driver worked it out so Becky could ride with me in the bus and not have to take a taxi. As I knew it would, the time we were together flew by.  We had a wonderful time both on and off trail, and I'm so happy she was able to share a part of my journey with me. A huge thank you to Becky's friend, Julia, for putting us up in her apartment and sharing the time with us. I had an uneventful, restful ride back to Wallingford through the rolling Vermont countryside.  The weather was cool and sunny, perfect for getting back on the trail. The taxi arrived right on time to take me to the trailhead. Upon arrival, I knew I was going to be delayed a bit in my start. Trail magic!  Jeboots started a thru hike with a friend back in April, but was forced to give up the hike due to her friend's injuries. She decided to drive to Vermont from Florida to provide surprise trail magic to hikers she had befriended while on the trail. She was also sharing her kindness with the rest of us as well. I enjoyed a banana and an orange along with a can of Coke and a bag of cheese crackers.  She urged me to take extra with me, but my pack was already full with four days of food. I stayed and chatted for a few minutes but then got going, since I was getting such a late start. The AT often leaves a road via a steep hill, and this was no exception. I traveled maybe a tenth of a mile to a parking area for day and section hikers.  As I entered the parking lot I was met by Sammy the dog, along with Mary and Mike, who were providing, you guessed it, Trail Magic. Their son had thru hiked in 2012, and they were paying forward by providing fresh vegetables, wonderful homemade cookies, and drinks. I ate fresh broccoli, cauliflower, and tomatoes with ranch dressing, drank a cold bottled water, and several of the delicious cookies. Mike coached baseball for many years and was sporting an Expos cap. We discussed baseball for awhile, and I told them about seeing the Lake Monster game last night. Although my pack was already heavy, Mary had no trouble convincing me to take some extra cookies with me.  Some hiker back in Virginia told me that Trail Magic dried up as you went north, but that hasn't been my experience at all. Kind, giving people live everywhere. Thank you, Jeboots, Mike, and Mary for being the Trail Angels that you are (you, too, Sammy!).  Full of human (and canine) kindness and cookies, I returned to the trail. I initially hiked up Bear Mountain  (I'm guessing every state with mountains has one called Bear) which was rather steep, but the trail was good. After the descent, I walked through an area that reminded me of home. This must be the area that Milk Shake told me abour, since I could have been on the Ozark Trail in Missouri. I then crossed Clarendon Gorge via a suspension bridge that was dedicated to a hiker who had lost his life crossing near this spot years ago. There were two very steep ascents out of Clarendon Gorge,  one a rock scramble and the other a dirt trail. I find I prefer the rock scrambles because they are more interesting and you can step up from rock to rock. The steep dirt ascents require leaning forward on tiptoe and pushing forward with legs and poles. Either way, I made it to the top of each and continued on my way.  Both ascents offered slightly different views of the Rutland airport below.I passed a sign on a tree about a mile from Governor Clement Shelter, announcing that I was 500 miles from Katahdin. In some ways it feels like I just started and in others like I've been on the trail forever.  Perhaps because this entire experience is just so different from anything else I have ever done. Whatever it is, I know I'll just keep walking until I reach that final white blaze. I reached Governor Clement Shelter right at 7:00. I thought about pushing on a few more miles since I want to get to Hanover to meet up with Dustin in a few days. The next possible tenting area I could find in the guidebook was still four miles away, so I decided to camp and get an early start tomorrow.  I'm glad I did, as I was required to use my headlamp earlier than I expected to finish my outdoor chores. It was too dark to see just a bit after 8:00. I was in my sleeping bag by 9:00 and plan on getting up early.  Rain is in the forecast, and I hope to be on the trail before it begins, and I hope to cover some pretty good miles tomorrow. I usually sleep for a few hours before writing my journal (it is presently 2:46 am), but this evening I tried to take some notes and do my journal before my initial sleep.  Here are my notes (as best as I can decipher them): ""Up early/bus/breakfast -- Got to station, oatmeal luggage isn't how she imitated. It's who owls at night. Thieves --""  I guess I'll continue getting those first few hours of sleep after all. I can't have someone stealing my ""who owls"" or my ""oatmeal luggage,"" even if she isn't imitating it.","VT 140/Wallingford, VT (Burlington, VT)

I was up and going earlier than usual this morning for two reasons. The first was that I had a big mileage day planned, since the only town that makes sense for Dustin to meet me in is Hanover, NH, which was still 57.2 miles away. Rain was also in the forecast, and I wanted to be packed and hopefully on trail when it began.  My pack was leaning against a tree, patiently waiting for me to finish in the privy, when I first heard rain drops on the roof.  Rain would be my almost constant companion from 7:00 this morning until 5:00 this evening.  I started the day by hiking up Mount Killington, the second highest peak in Vermont.  It was a long, steep, wet climb, but there were only a few instances where the going was difficult. I added 2000 feet in elevation over a 4.3 mile climb and reached Copper Lodge Shelter, located just below the summit.  There is a 0.2 mile side trail to the actual summit, where it is reported there are magnificent views. A foggy mist accompanied the rain, so I chose to remain on the AT and bypassed the summit.  The rain intensified on my way down, but, while I did fall once today, it was from tripping over a rock and not from slipping in the mud or on a slick rock.  I ate lunch at Churchill Scott Shelter, about nine miles into my hike. I shared lunch time with Black Horse, who completed a northbound thru hike in 2010. He is presently section hiking the Long Trail. He finished his section ahead of schedule and was chilling out in the shelter, waiting until tomorrow to hike down to the road where his wife will pick him up. The thought of hanging around in a shelter on a rainy day with nothing to do was strangely appealing, but I bade him farewell and hiked out in the rain.  After a long descent of Mount Killington, I reached US 4, another busy highway to cross. At one such intersection, a poster full of helpful hints was mounted on a tree.  Titled, Don't be Roadkill, it offered such advice as waiting until there were no cars visible, walking straight across the road and not diagonally, and running if necessary. Sage words of wisdom indeed. Just prior to the intersection (where I really did have to run as a car appeared after I began crossing), 1700 was spelled out in sticks beside the trail, denoting another hundred miles completed on my journey.  A mile past the highway is the Maine Junction, where the AT and the Long Trail split ways after sharing the first 105 miles of Vermont. Both the AT and the Long Trail are blazed in white, so it was imperative to turn the right way at this point. People tell stories of wayward hikers who have hiked miles on the Long Trail before realizing their error. It is certainly well marked now, and a helpful soul added further clarification with a Sharpee, labeling the correct way, ""AT,"" and the other way, ""Not AT.""  I made the correct choice and soon hiked into Gifford Woods State Park. The AT goes through the park and runs parallel to a large lake for awhile before heading down to the very impressive Thundering Falls. I decided to walk over to the park office to fill my water bottles.  The office includes a covered pavilion where there was a fire place with a fire burning. There I met Maria, a friendly, outgoing park employee, who encouraged me to come and warm and dry myself by the fire. I stayed for about a half an hour, conversing with Maria and with Sam, the park manager. We had quite a conversation about Vermont mud (this has been a very muddy year, which I arrested to), sobos and nobos (there was a sobo vs. nobo volleyball game last week--nobos were the victors), and about other hiking and camping topics.  While I took a photo later of the very impressive Thundering Falls, I opted to use my photo of Maria and Sam as my journal photo for today, because the main thing I will take with me from my visit to the park was the friendly, lively interchange I had with them.  I left far sooner than I wanted, but I still had over six miles to go, and I really wanted to make it before dark. I was initially shivering from the ice cream drumstick I bought (it is never too cold for ice cream), but I soon was plenty warm from hiking. The hike up Quimby Mountain was tough, primarily because it came so late in the day. The entire climb was in steep switchbacks, with the summit remaining stubbornly in the distance for what seemed a very long time.  I finally reached the top and made better time to Stony Brook Shelter, arriving at 7:45.  Dusk had definitely settled in, but I was able to get most of my camp chores completed without my headlamp. Skywalker was in the shelter and told me that Gravity was camped in the tent area. It was good to see him again. I plan on another longer than usual day again tomorrow, and the terrain seems more conducive. There is apparently another chance of rain tomorrow, so I may be hiking again in what I like to call liquid sunshine.  Either way, I hope to get another early start, so I'll just wind this writing up and go back to sleep.","Governor Clement Shelter Tent Site

I was much more sore than usual when I arrived at the campsite last night, especially my shoulders, so I was pleased to find that I felt no pain this morning.  I planned another relatively long day of 18.1 miles today. I would not be able to make it to the shelter which was twenty-three miles away, so I looked on Guthooks, which indicated a small, unofficial campsite by Pomfret Brook. That became my objective for the day. As I was packing, I met Stretch, a sobo whose tent was near mine. Communication between sobos and nobos is very helpful, because the one has already accomplished what the other still has to do. Many times I have commented to sobos on the trail what will be coming up for them and have had the favor returned. My present concern was Hanover, where lodging can be expensive and scarce. Stretch told me that Dartmouth College allows hikers to camp for free in the woods alongside their softball field. She also let me know that the site is within easy walking distance of a food co-op, that offers good resupply options, as well as delicious rotisserie chicken and ice cream. Hanover problem solved! Thanks again, Stretch, and good hiking to Springer.  I was a little later getting on trail this morning but was confident I could make my objective before nightfall. For most of the day, the trail was pretty reasonable considering the amount of rain that fell yesterday.  Today, on the other hand, was cool and sunny. I did come across a very steep, rock drop off, that the trail designers solved by tying an aluminum ladder to trees so it leaned against the rock face. A bit later on, I slipped and fell on a tilted, flat rock before a stream. I fell completely down, but no harm done. It actually was a wonderful piece of happenstance. I berated my carelessness out loud, reminding myself with a few choice words that I needed to be careful, and, of course the blankety-blank rocks were slick.  I hiked perhaps a hundred feet beyond the stream and saw a blue tent like mine set up on a small, stealth camp spot.  I said to myself, ""That could be Brooke."" Well, it was Brooke, who I haven't seen since the Shenandoahs. He recognized my voice as I rather colorfully counseled myself by the stream, and he got out of his tent to say hello. We had a good chat about our progress before I continued on. It was good to see him again, and I owe it all to my inherent clumsiness.  I made good time to my next objective, The Lookout, a privately owned cabin with a lookout perch constructed on the roof. The owners allow hikers to stay there, and I wanted to check it out. Right before I got there, I saw Spills, who was slackpacking southbound today. We talked about the rest of my time with Becky, and she asked me to tell her ""hi"" for her.  The view from The Lookout was spectacular, and the weather cooperated by being sunny and clear. There was a sign by the door, cautioning that there was to be no ""tires"" of any kind.  I demonstrated my quick thinking by asking Skywalker what purpose there was to banning bicycles and ATVs before realizing that some jokester had changed the ""f"" on the word ""fires"" to a ""t."" Sigh.  It was apparent that it was a sunny day following a rainy one by the number of tents, sleeping bags, and other equipment spread out on the bushes surrounding the cabin. Fortunately, I had not had to set up or break camp in the rain, so my gear remainded pretty much dry.  I enjoyed the view from the perch for a bit and ate my lunch before continuing on. The woods today often consisted of a myriad of slender trees intermixed with larger ones that allowed the sunlight through in a bright, dappled fashion. It was quite beautiful.  The trail also poked out of the woods several times today and crossed sunny meadows of grass and wildflowers.  The contrast was amazing. So much of the AT is in the woods that it is unexpectedly refreshing to walk in fields, particularly ones with colorful flowers and with farm houses and mountains in the distance.  The trail also wound its way through very thick brush, higher than my head, which, honestly, was not my favorite part of the day. I learned about On the Edge Farm from a passing sobo but probably would have checked it out anyway from their sign on the AT information board by Bernard Gulf Road (VT 12). Located a mere 0.2 miles off trail,  On the Edge Farm offers all kinds of tasty and healthy homemade options. I chatted with Dana, the owner, as I purchased a huge piece of watermelon, a banana, a Gatorade, and a delicious Vermont Maple Soda. I sat at the picnic table with Bisquick as I ate.  Fresh fruit has become a new go-to food for me when it is available. This side trip delayed me a bit, but I'm really glad I stopped, as it did wonders to refresh me for the several relatively short, but very steep, hills that still separated me from Pomfret Brook. I covered the last four miles of the day in fine spirits and found a nice little flat spot, with a fallen log that served nicely as a bench, just up the hill from the brook, which is actually quite large by AT standards.  I set up my tent,  threw up my bear rope (always much easier done before dark), and got water from the brook as the sun set. I arrived at 7:20, and it was too dark to function without a headlamp by a bit after eight. As I cooked my supper by the light of my lamp, I realized that for the first time of this entire trip, I am camping all by myself. While I tend to be a social person, I found myself trully enjoying the solitude. I'm presently snug in my sleeping bag on a slightly cool night, listening to the water of Pomfret Brook, probably somewhat swollen by the recent rain, rush by.  I plan on an early start tomorrow,  as I have 18.8 miles to travel to get to Hanover. My friend, Dustin, will be meeting me there to hike the next three days with me. He's a good friend and an accomplished outdoorsman, who, years ago as a Boy Scout, patiently tried to teach his Scoutmaster how to fly fish. He's flying from Denver to hike with me, and to add another chapter in this journey's storybook. I'm really looking forward to sharing a part of it with him.","Stony Brook Shelter Tent Site

In spite of my alarm being set for 5:00, I was unable to begin functioning this morning before 5:30. I guess my body knows how much rest it needs, and I should quit trying to mess with that. I packed up and was on the trail before 7:00. I was excited to get to Hanover because my friend, Dustin, was flying in from Denver to hike with me for several days. Dustin, an Eagle Scout from the troop where I was Scoutmaster, is an avid outdoorsman who, among other accomplishments, introduced me to fly fishing. Several southbounders had told me that the trail into Hanover was not too difficult. Like the past few days, there were numerous ascents and descents, but none of them long. The trail was also just that, trail. There were few obstructions to slow my progress over the last 19.6 miles to Hanover.  The weather also cooperated again, and the day was sunny, cool, and breezy. The woods were again quite fetching, and the trail frequently entered open meadows with views of the mountains in the distance.  As I walked into one such meadow, I observed a small group of sobos enter the field at the other end. It was an enjoyable several minutes as we were both able to watch the other approach.  We paused and talked a bit about upcoming trail conditions before wishing each other Happy Trails and continuing on our respective ways.  It was this way that I learned about the hornets nest that was ahead.  Apparently, several hikers had been stung and informal warning signs had already been posted near the hive. One hiker advised to not take time to read the sign but to immediately bypass the hornets by cutting around them through the woods. I was thus prepared when I saw the note. I observed several hornets flying around the trail as I worked my way through the brush, but was not stung. I, of course, made sure to warn any southbound hiker I saw after I passed the hornets. I encountered a slight delay of a much more pleasant type this morning. Blackberries. Bushes and bushes of wild blackberries grow in this one open section, and I paused to eat quite a few. I have never seen so many blackberries in one place before.  Interestingly, I saw no others anywhere else today.  After passing the blackberries, I continued to make good time. I wanted to make it to Hanover with enough time to meet Dustin and set up camp before dark. The trail led out onto the road in West Hartford, crossed a stream, and then made a left turn onto another road.  I didn't see a blaze and asked a woman who was barbecuing on her porch for directions. This is how I met Trail Angel Linda. ""It goes down that road past the old church,"" she told me. ""Before you go, would you like a cup of coffee or a cold soda, or both?"" Before I knew it, I not only had two cups of coffee and two sodas, but also two steak sandwiches, a cupcake, and other goodies. Linda has been taking care of hikers who pass by her home for years.  She said her record was 1,500 in a single year. We passed the time awhile, and I signed her guest book, before I left to continue on to Hanover while I still had enough time.  As i was leaving, I was pleasantly surprised to meet up with the Colonel and U-Turn, whom I haven't seen in months. They had decided to do a flip-flop hike, heading to Katahdin after Harpers Ferry and continuing southbound from there. It was great to see them again. I then left and began my final push into Hanover. The final mile and a half is along roads, and I texted Dustin when I reached the road. He replied that he had just recently arrived in Hanover. He hiked out to meet me, and we met just south of the Connecticut River, which is the border between Vermont and New Hampshire. We crossed over the river together,  and Dustin, who was a friend of Beau's, helped me set a bit of him free into the air above the river.  Dustin was a member of the group of us who spread Beau's remains at his favorite hiking spot all those years ago, and we talked again of the butterfly that landed on his dad's shoulder during our ceremony. It was a moment of quiet reflection in the midst of our joy at seeing each other again and another reflection of the influence that Beau had on the other scouts in our troop. Dustin and I then hiked into the town of Hanover, found the spot in the woods behind the softball field, and set up our tents. We headed to the grocery store so I could resupply and then to Murphy's, a pub that also serves food. We had a great dinner before heading back to the woods.  We'll hike out together in the morning. It's great to see him again and to be able to backpack with him again, this time as two adults.","Stealth campsite along Promfret Brook

I slept in until 6:00 and then began to leisurely prepare for the day. Dustin was also up and getting ready.  I sat on a log and sorted out my resupply that I had purchased at the co-op. All I did when we got back to camp last night was dump everything loosely in my food bag so we could get it strung up in a tree. Granted, there was little chance of encountering a bear on the outskirts of Hanover, but there are always other critters, so Dustin and I decided to be safe and hang our food. Considering how quickly I was forced to make my purchases last night (we arrived at the co-op at 7:50 and they closed at 8:00), I did a pretty good job of getting what I needed. All hikers handle their food supply in different ways. Some buy ingredients and prepare meals almost like they would at home. Some go stoveless and use only ready to eat foods. I like to organize my food by type of meal and have started pre-packaging my lunches and snacks into individual quart-size Ziploc bags. It may be a bit compulsive, but it works for me. It didn't take long for Dustin and me to get packed. We then headed back to the co-op to fill our water bottles, use the restroom (a privy that flushes!), and get some breakfast. I bought a tasty egg, cheese, and sausage biscuit and a bottle of orange juice. With all this, we were still on the trail by 9:00.  We started with a short, steep climb followed by several miles of a more gradual upward direction. Although I enjoyed the challenge of getting to Hanover to meet Dustin, it was quite refreshing to hike with a more relaxed attitude. We have about forty-five miles to cover to get to Glencliff, where we will spend our last night together in a hostel before Dustin returns home. It was really fun to be hiking with him again after all these years. We hiked for two hours and took a short snack break. I was feeling a bit drowsy for some reason and leaned up against a trail sign for a short, ten-minute nap. We then hiked to the base of Moose Mountain and ate lunch. The eclipse was under way, so I made a crude pin-hole camera out of a piece of foil from a tuna packet. It was also interesting to note the changes in shadows, particularly of our trekking poles. The shadow edges were fuzzy and shifted when the pole was  moved back and forth. Unlike back home in Missouri, where there was totality, I never noticed the light dimming much. Becky sent me a photograph from home, taken at totality, and it was stunning. We met several day hikers on their way down from Moose Mountain who had climbed to the summit to get a clear view of the eclipse. Dustin and I worked our way up Moose, which was Dustin's first real climb on this trip. A friend from home asked me recently how many named mountains I have climbed so far, and I really have no idea. It is certainly in the dozens.  Perhaps when I'm home I may spend a few hours with my maps and try to figure that out. We arrived at the summit and were greeted by a very nice, although somewhat hazy, view. Another thru hiker was there who took a photo of Dustin and me with the mountains in the distance.  We discussed what mountains they might be, and if one of them was Mount Moosilauke, our first major mountain on the way to the Whites. Located about three miles south of the White Mountain National Forest,  Moosilauke lies just thirty-eight miles from where we were standing on Moose. Dustin and I continued on and were almost immediately forced to make a decision. We had considered looking for a stealth site near the northern peak of Moose Mountain but found out that camping was prohibited there. Our options were to camp at Moose Mountain Shelter or try to push on another six miles to Trapper John Shelter, named for the fictional character from MASH. The trail between involved a quite steep descent and an immediate ascent, so we decided to call it a day and camp at the shelter area. We talked about all kinds of things as we took our time setting up camp. I strung a clothes line to air out my sleeping bag. The water source was very marginal, and we carefully scooped out a liter apiece for cooking. We were both very glad that we had each toted an extra liter up Moose, since the guidebook warned about the condition of the stream by the shelter. We walked over to check out the shelter building and located the privy, an open air affair unlike any one I have seen before, and then cooked dinner. Gravity arrived just prior to dark, and got to meet Dustin. We called it an early evening and headed for bed at 8:15. Today was a great day of hiking and camping with a good friend, and we'll be ready for more tomorrow. The guidebook mentions a ""precipitous drop-off"" along Holts Ledge, where we will be headed in the morning. Since I strongly doubt there will be coping stones, it should prove interesting.","Hanover, NH (Dartmouth College)

In spite of good intentions, I slept in until nearly six o'clock this morning.  Dustin and I were ready for the trail before eight, when I headed for the privy. It was an unusual one, with a raised platform, four roof supports, and no walls. There was also no toilet seat. I can't imagine what would induce some ne'er-do-well to make off with a privy seat, but all that remained were the hinge hardware and a roughly oval, wooden hole. No matter, as nature called. As soon as I could, I returned to our campsite to begin out daily hike. Unfortunately, I failed to notice my parachute cord clothes line that I strung up last night, and it got left behind. Nearly twelve hours and a challenging day's hike later, Gravity refused my friendly request that he go back and fetch it for me. Truth be told, his refusal was a tad on the rude side. Go figure. We started the day by completing the ridge hike along Moose Mountain and then began a steep descent to Goose Pond Road. At the road, we found a five gallon jug of water that some Trail Angel left for hikers. While we had enough water to make it to the next source, it was refreshing to be able to get a good, extra drink. We then began the sharp ascent up to Holts Ledge. Along the way, we met JayBird and Towhee, a couple who were doing a flip-flop thru hike.  JayBird had previously completed a nobo hike in 2011 and completed the Pacific Crest Trail in 2012. It seems I finally met my match in love of ice cream. JayBird and Towhee hiked north to Pine Furnace State Park in Pennsylvania,  which you may recall is the home of the famed AT Half Gallon Challenge. They decided they like ice cream so much that they got a ride to Katahdin and are now returning southbound to enjoy a second helping at Pine Furnace when they complete their thru hike. They are a delightful couple, and I wish them all the best as they complete their quest for more ice cream. With a lightened step and a warmed heart, Dustin and I continued upward to Holts Ledge.  Upon arrival, I found that while there is a precipitous drop-off, as advertised in the guidebook, it was not necessary to hike along it. Nonetheless, Dustin was kind enough to gift me with my own, personal, portable coping stone. I took a photo of him at the view from the Ledge, holding my stone, before I tucked it away in my belt pouch. I will carry it to Katahdin and will never be in need of coping stones again. I figure I will just transfer it to whichever belt pouch is facing the precipice I am transversing.  On the way down from Holts Ledge, we came to Trapper John Shelter and decided to eat lunch there. It was 0.3 miles off trail, but I couldn't resist going to a shelter named after a fictitious doctor. The shelter was a standard eight-person affair that includes the remains of a large, stone fireplace left over from the cabin that used to reside at the spot. There was a good water source and a very ambitous chipmunk.  The little fellow must have figured we were intruding on his home and were the height of rudeness by not offering him a host gift. If we left our packs unattended for even a few seconds, he would rush over from his perch by the fireplace to see if he could help himself to any goodies. Although it is a very rare occurrence for me, I decided to visit the privy after my lunch time nap (taken while Dustin kindly safeguarded our packs from Mr. Chipmunk). I had to return for my camera, because this privy more than made up for the one this morning.  Not only did it feature an arm chair for a toilet seat, it also provided helpful instructions. A large ""Exit Only"" arrow was thoughtfully provided on the back wall, with the arrow pointing straight down. As directionally confused as I am known to be, this little reminder, while probably unnecessary, certainly provided me with a hearty laugh. Back on the trail, Dustin and I continued toward today's objective of the summit of Smarts Mountain.  It became very warm and muggy.  In just two miles we reached Grant Brook and decided to drink our fill and also tote an extra liter up the mountain,  since the water source at the top is considered unreliable. Here we met Minutes, Sun, and Gravity (who had passed us by not going to the shelter). The brook and the area around it were cool and inviting. We all delayed awhile as we got water, none of us enthused about the upcoming climb up Smarts Mountain.  We left the brook with full bottles and an extra two pounds of.water at 4:00 to complete the 3.7 mile hike to the top, with an elevation change of 2,100 feet. Dustin was introduced to rock and boulder scrambling, along with some very steep climbing and ridge walking. It took us nearly three hours to complete the hike, as thunder started rumbling ominously in the distance. The end of the climb was extremely steep and included one area where there were log stairs, followed by rock stairs, followed by rebar stairs. Most of the time, you were left to your own devices to figure out how to keep moving upward, in true AT fashion. I know I will be in the Whites in a few days, so I might as well get all the conditioning I can get. We finally reached the tent area at the summit as the wind picked up and the thunder increased.  Gravity arrived shortly after, and we soon had our tents set up. Room was tight, and we needed to make sure we had adequate tree cover for the imminent storm. This is when I realized I no longer had my parachute cord, as I wanted to add an additional tie from my tent to a tree on the windward side of my tent. After Gravity rather ingratiously refused my request to run back the 12.3 miles to fetch my rope (hey, he could have slackpacked), I made due with an extra shoelace. The rain picked up thirty minutes after our arrival, and we all headed for our tents. The thunderstorm began in earnest at 9:00. I could hear the wind blowing hard in the treetops, but the trees offered good protection and little reached my tent. The rain has stopped for now (it is 12:30), and the temperature has stopped significantly. There is a fire tower 0.1 miles further on at the summit of Smarts Mountain, and I would love a good view of my upcoming challenges in the Whites. I'll settle for a non-rainy morning, but I guess I'll take what I get. I had another great day with Dustin and am pleased that he is getting a representative taste of what hiking the AT is all about. We plan on 12.9 miles tomorrow and will see what the trail dishes up for us tomorrow. I'm sure it will be fun, even though it probably won't include ice cream.","Moose Mountain Shelter Tent Site

The storm passed through during the night, and this morning dawned chilly and misty. I wore my warm pull over for the first time in months while I was getting ready but changed into my regular hiking shirt when I left camp. Dustin and I stopped at the fire tower at the top of Smarts Mountain and, despite the misty fog, climbed into the enclosed observation deck at the top. We watched the fog rush by and could catch glimpses of patches of sky, lakes, and mountains. It was quite a show. The mist cleared as we hiked down the mountain to South Jacobs Brook. The descent trail was far less of a challenge than the ascent had been last evening. The brook was wide and beautiful, with the trail crossing it on a substantial foot bridge. Dustin, an avid fisherman, explained to me how he would approach fishing in the brook. We collected water and sat a while by the stream. As Dustin sat gazing at the water, I was reminded how he had always seemed at home in the outdoors, even as a young Boy Scout.  It is such a joy to be backpacking with him again, and to be reminded of the fine man he has become.  After resting a bit, we then began the ascent of Mount Cube, which entailed quite a bit of rock scrambling and steep climbing. We passed Eastman Ledges along the way and enjoyed the view. We stopped at an overlook and ate lunch on the open rock face while taking in the view. The final climb to the top was arduous, but an enjoyable challenge, although I was glad when we reached the summit. We could see mountains far into the distance, and we surmised over which ones I might be crossing in the near future. We then hiked down the mountain to another fast-moving stream, Brackett Brook, where we again obtained water and each of us packed an extra liter, anticipating another dry camp at our destination of Ore Hill Campsite.  I learned about an unusually wonderful Trail Angel a few days before, who we would hopefully meet today. Called the Omelet Man, he reportedly sets up every day along the trail and provides delicious omelets for all hikers. I had been told he was along the next road but was only open until five. Dustin and I covered the next 1.7 miles in record time, only to find that my information was incorrect, and that the Omelet Man practiced his culinary artistry along the next road, which was 1.8 miles further on. The topography in my guidebook indicated only a slight increase in elevation over that stretch, and the race against time was on. It was a fun challenge to see if I could cover the distance before five, and I made it with ten minutes to spare.  Unfortunately, the Omelet Man's unique set up under a large tarp beside the trail was vacant.  I rechecked the information in Guthooks to find that the Omelet Man was open until five every day but Wednesday, when he closes up shop at 2:30. I checked the recent entries in his log book and read reviews from countless hikers, thanking this special Trail Angel for his kindness and raving about the quality of his omelets. I am disappointed I will be unable to meet the Omelet Man and left a note in his journal thanking him for what he is doing for hikers. The next available campsite is too far along to make backtracking a possibility, and we need to get to Glencliff tomorrow so I can resupply for my upcoming time in the White Mountains. Dustin will also stay at the hostel tomorrow night before catching a shuttle back to Hanover on Friday so he can fly home to Denver.  Although our race to the Omelet Man proved fruitless, it provided us with extra time to be in camp together on our last night on the trail.  We leisurely set up camp, spread our equipment out to air after the rain last night, and prepared our dinners. Gravity arrived soon after and joined us. It was a special evening of camping to go along with the day of hiking. I am so happy and honored that Dustin flew all the way from Denver to share this experience with me, and I look forward to visiting him, his wonderful fiancee, Erin, as well as their puppies, Lily and Wilson, in the future.","Smarts Mountain Summit Tentsite

Note: I was able to upload the photos from Burlington to Ore Hill Campsite today.
We got up early this morning, because we wanted to get to the hostel as soon as we could. Before I left, I went to use the privy and finally understood why it gets top billing on the sign along the trail. I wondered at that when I first arrived, because the sign reads ""Privy"" in large letters with ""& Tent sites"" added in smaller letters below it.  The privy is a castle with ""Castellum Excrementi"" proudly displayed above the door.  The toilet is truly a throne, and the word ""Dungeon"" appears above the clean out screen in the back. Using it, I felt a bit like Ned Stark from Game of Thrones before he lost his head. We were on the trail by 7:15. It turned out to be our easiest day of the four that Dustin hiked with me.  We encountered a large pile of moose scat beside a lake but saw no sign of the animal.  The climb up Mist Mountain, the last one that Dustin and I did together, went well.  On the way up, I met my long lost son.  I stopped and chatted awhile with a sobo and made sure he knew about the upcoming Omelet Man. Just before we parted ways, I asked him his trail name. ""Twig,"" he answered. ""Son!"" I exclaimed.  We both laughed as we parted ways. Near the end of our hike today, I came across the number 400 on the trail. As I crossed it, I had less than 400 miles to go. Once we got to the road, it was a short walk down to the Hikers Welcome Hostel, where we would spend the night. They have a great set up, and it is obvious that the hostel is run by thru hikers. There is a checklist of things to purchase. Near the top of the list is the ""Hiker Special."" A pizza, soda, chips, and ice cream for $5.00. Yes, they know what we want.  Dustin and I decided to tent instead of staying in the building, and we took advantage of their clothes line.  I met Bag of Tricks, a wonderfully funny man who works at the hostel.  He does perfect owl impressions: ""Who bakes for you, who bakes for me."" He also tells very funny jokes: ""What is the difference between a thru hiker and Bigfoot?  One is a hairy, dirty, smelly creature that lives in the woods, and the other is a myth."" It was great sharing time with him. He hiked with Earl Shaffer in 1998 and is a true AT character.  Well met, Tricks!  The shower, laundry, and toilet set-up is located outside and quite unique. It was one of the best showers I have had on the trip and having clean clothes again is almost heaven. With true hiker trash humor, there is a brown blaze painted on the toilet seat. At 5:00, we took the shuttle to Warren to resupply and to eat at the Roadside Grill, a wonderful local diner where we ate outside. On the way into town, we passed a random ICBM missile standing near town. I suppose it has been decommissioned, but stands there silently safeguarding the town. Live free or die! After returning to the hostel,  I sorted my food and then relaxed with Bag of Tricks, Dustin, Spills, Scout, Gandalf, Jelly Bean, and a few others while watching some movie and listening to stories from Bag of Tricks. A bat joined us for awhile, but we opened the door and it decided to leave. Dustin and I headed for bed. We'll share in the hiker breakfast in the morning, before Dustin gets a shuttle to the airport and I head out for Mount Moosilauke and the beginning of the Whites.  It has been a wonderful four days for me hiking with Dustin.

Dustin and I both signed up for breakfast this morning, which was served at 7:00. Again, it is obvious that Legion, who operates the hostel, understands hikers.  Two hikers who had been at the hostel yesterday explained the routine. At seven o'clock sharp, we were all seated around the table with a plate and fork before us. Legion appeared bearing a large platter of pancakes, a big bowl of scrambled eggs, and a plate heaped with bacon. By the time we were finished, one lonely pancake was all that remained. Scout found room to polish it off.  During breakfast, Legion talked about hiking the Whites.  He stressed the need to take it slow and to forgo any ideas of doing large miles.  He pointed out that the Whites were in many ways the Crown Jewels of the AT and should be enjoyed, and not viewed as something to be gotten through. Fortunately, I took his message to heart. I had completely packed before breakfast and was ready to hike out by 8:00. I jokingly asked Legion if I could get a shuttle back to the trailhead, a distance of perhaps a quarter mile. ""Sure,"" he replied, ""but it will cost you fifty bucks."" Needless to say that, after bidding a fond farewell to Dustin, I walked. Legion would later shuttle him to the airport. Thank you again, Dustin!  My initial plan was to hike to the summit of Mount Moosilauke and stop at the next shelter which was located part way down the other side, a distance of 7.8 miles. The ascent for northbounders was reported to be long and steep, but it's the descent on the other side that really gets attention. On the ascent, the trail gains 3,458 feet over the course of 4.4 miles.  On the descent, the trail drops 2,932 feet in 3.8 miles. There is a section, however, where the descent is 1,932 feet in a mere 1.3 miles. While I knew it would be a long, hard day, I was excited to climb my first big mountain in the Whites, and to be above tree line. The ascent, while long and slow, was not particularly difficult to hike, and I covered the 4.4 miles in a little over three hours, arriving at the summit at 12:15. The wind picked up as I cleared the last of the trees and followed the line of rock cairns set up to establish the trail when visibility is poor.  It was cold and windy at the top, and completely socked in with fog. Another hiker took my photo at the summit, and then I huddled behind one of the rocky windbreaks to eat my lunch.  About a half an hour after I arrived, as I was getting ready to begin my descent, an amazing thing happened. The wind picked up even more, and the fog was gone in about two minutes. The ensuing views were stunning. Between the cold, hard gusts of wind and the fact I was shivering a bit, not all of my photos turned out, but I am so pleased I got to see the views. I had my photo taken at the summit again, and headed to the shelter, which was 2.3 miles away. The trail was somewhat rugged and steep, but nothing like what would come later, and I reached the shelter at 3:15.  I had planned to stay the night there, but Slingshot had news that altered things.  Gravity and his friend, Felix, who had stayed at the shelter just north of the hostel last night, had recently left to hike on to a stealth campsite near the road at the bottom of Moosilauke. I was feeling fine, so I decided to join them.  The descent was indeed very steep, and I took my time as I worked my way down boulder to boulder. There were places where wooden chocks and rebar grab irons were added to assist, but it was largely a case of trying to puzzle out a doable passageway down through the boulders.  Most of the way down, the trail parallels a beautiful, noisy, fast flowing stream that cascades down the mountain in a series of waterfalls. It took me over two hours to complete that 1.3 miles, but the time flew by, and I was comforted by the fact that I still had hours before dark. I caught up with Gravity and Felix on the way down,  so we reached the campsite together. We had just started setting up our tents when I heard this voice loudly call out, ""Felix J. McGillicuty, how the heck are you?"" I am learning that Felix is very well known among the AT community, and his friend, Stitches, had gotten wind that he was around.  Felix hiked sobo in 1998, and Stitches is a 1999 nobo, and they are good friends. Stitches had her van and offered us a ride into town for dinner.  She didn't need to offer twice. We quickly set up our tents and stowed our gear. Stormy, who was already in her tent, had just returned from town and offered to keep an eye on things. We brought her back a coveted Fanta Grape soda to say thanks. We piled into the van and headed for town. We ate at a pizzeria and had a great time eating and joking with our server. Felix is a natural comedian and a lot of fun to be around. After dinner, we returned to our campsite to go to bed. I'm not sure how far we'll hike tomorrow, but I am sure to remember to take my time, not push too hard, and to continue enjoying my journey through the Whites.","NH 25, Hikers Welcome Hostel

The sun rose on a bright, chilly morning, but I didn't join in until I woke up at 6:30. I packed up, got water from the brook, and headed up the trail to the parking lot on Lost River Road, where a privy was located. Stitches was there, and she brought donuts! I ate a donut and chatted briefly with Stitches, Felix, and Gravity before setting off on the trail. Stitches took a photo of the three of us as we prepared to go. I checked it a bit later only to find it was blurry and unfocused. At first I thought there was something wrong with my camera, only to discover that it had been temporarily sabotaged by a blob of donut icing smeared on the lense.  The price of quick calories. With a cleaned off lense, I began the climb up Wolf Mountain. Much smaller than Moosilauke, Wolf still provided challenging trail. While far easier than yesterday, it soon became obvious that our work was cut out for us.  Along the way to the summit, I met Ralph, Gravity's friend who previously hiked with us from Harpers Ferry, through Maryland, and into Pennsylvania. He decided that was so much fun that he would rejoin us in the Whites. His previous exploit of shinnying up a bear pole in Maryland had left him with a trail name, Polecat.  Polecat waited near the summit of Wolf, while I continued on to catch up with Felix, who is a far faster hiker. He decided he needed to continue on, since he only has a limited number of days before returning to work. I ate lunch with him before he headed onward.  I really enjoyed his positive, very humorous personality and wish him well on his plan to complete his second section hike. The trail down from Wolf was also slow going, slightly complicated with ponds of soupy, deep mud that masqueraded as trail.  I know that Leave No Trace might say to walk right through it, but I checked the depth of the first such ""muddle"" with my trekking pole, which sank in over a foot without reaching bottom. The descent was through a beautiful spruce forest, and I continued my approach of letting it take as long as it took and enjoyed the ride. The trail crossed a power line 0.6 miles from Eliza Brook Shelter, and I got my first look at Mount Kinsman, looming before me. The trail to its summit rises 1,972 feet over 2.5 miles, and is reportedly more challenging than the ascent of Moosilauke. I reached Eliza Brook Shelter at 3:30, hours before I would normally stop hiking. The next camping area was Kinsman Pond Shelter, ""only"" four miles away. Mount Kinsman sits between the two shelters, calmly waiting my arrival. With only about four more hours of daylight, I decided to call it an early day and will take on Kinsman in the morning. I leisurely set up camp and went to fetch water from Eliza Brook, a good-sized stream that I am now listening to as I write this. I noticed Jelly Bean getting water a bit upstream and asked if I could take her picture. Later, as I was reviewing my photos from the day, I originally mistook that photo as one of the trail. Yes, it's just a ""walk in the woods.""  As I completed setting up, a group of about ten young people entered the area and set up camp up the hill from me.  I talked with them as they passed by me and learned they were with Tufts University.  It is a common practice for universities in this area to provide incoming freshman the opportunity to go on a backpacking trip as part of their orientation, which seems like a wonderful idea to me. One of the young women was wearing a Boston Red Sox hat, and I teased her a bit about that. I would later learn that her dad also likes to backpack and that she is considering majoring in physics. I told her that to me her trail name would always be ""Boston."" While cooking dinner, I had a wonderful conversation with Anna and Avi, the two students who are leading the excursion from Tufts. Anna, a senior majoring in Sociology, and Avi, a junior with a double major in cognitive and computer science, participated in the program as freshman and decided to pay it forward by returning as guides.  They both obviously possess thoughtful, compassionate personalities, and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation. Boston came over and pitched in with dinner preparation, which consisted of real vegetables, pasta, and a peanut butter sauce that Avi created.  Anna mentioned that all the meals were vegetarian, although not vegan. She told me she was vegetarian, and I shared with her a way to deal with anyone who ever teased her about it. I suggested that she get a little wild-eyed, stare intently at the person, and say, ""You know.  I didn't become a vegetarian because I like animals. I became a vegetarian because I really, really hate plants!""  In between the jokes and laughter, I shared a wonderful conversation with them about the backpacking program and the importance of being outdoors, and about the effect the program had on them. They are both trully special young people, and I wish them both the best in their futures.  As I have written before, I am continually impressed with the young people I encounter on this trail. All the best to both of you, Anna and Avi! Hiker midnight approached, so I headed for my tent. It is a chilly evening and Autumn is certainly in the air. I look forward to the challenge that Mount Kinsman will undoubtedly provide for me tomorrow, but for now it's time to go back to sleep so I'll be ready for another day, as I slowly close in on Katahdin.","Stealth Camp by Beaver Brook

I was up and moving early this morning, and Gravity, Polecat, and I were on the trail by 7:30.  I now understand the warnings about how much daily hiking distances are shortened in the Whites.  I read one account that maintains that when you reach New Hampshire, you have completed 80% of the mileage but have expended only 20% of the energy required to complete a thru hike.  I'm not sure that that is much of an exaggeration.  The difficulty of the terrain is why Gravity, Polecat, and I decided we would hike together and not just plan on stopping at the same place.  Our objective for today was to summit the south and north peaks of Kinsman Mountain and then aim for the Lonesome Lake Hut, which is operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club.  True to reports we received from people who have already hiked it, the trail up Kinsman Mountain was extremely steep and rocky, perhaps the most difficult ascent of the journey so far. It paralleled Eliza Brook for the first 0.8 miles, which cascades down the mountain with a myriad of small waterfalls. It was tough climbing, but along beautiful scenery. When it wasn't rocks, then it was roots.  Or mud. Or muddy rocks. There was very little of what you might call trail today, but we took it slow and steady, and I was able to enjoy the experience of being in the White Mountains after the 1,800 miles to get here.  I'm very happy that I did not try to push the extra distance yesterday, as it took several hours to cover the 2.5 miles from the shelter to the summit.  Near the summit, we shared lunch with Brother Buzz, Quarter Mile, and Tiny, who I met yesterday at Eliza Brook campground. Brother Buzz thru hiked in 2005, and Quarter Mile is close to completing her section hike.  Tiny is also section hiking. They are all seasoned hikers, and Brother Buzz and Quarter Mile have hiked extensively in the Whites and were a great source of information. I really enjoyed visiting with them both yesterday evening while we prepared our dinners, and today for lunch.  We shared the view from the summit with them, which was absolutely stunning. We could see down into the valley as well as mountains far into the distance. Brother Buzz pointed out where we had been as well as where we are going.  After enjoying the view and posing for photos, we continued on our way.  The trail in the saddle between the summits was not at severe as the ascent had been. The descent was also quite challenging, again through woods of spruce and pine, and it was 4:30 before we reached the Lonesome Lake Hut.  We stopped in for a bowl of soup and to see if there was an opportunity to stay or if we would need to continue on until we found a stealth campsite down the trail. We were offered an opportunity to work for stay. By volunteering to work for two hours after dinner is completed by the paying guests, we could eat leftovers and then sleep on the floor at no cost.  That sounded like a pretty good deal to me, and we opted to stay. Our services would not be required until around 7:30, so after eating our bowl of soup, we headed down to Lonesome Lake. The lake is beautiful and our upcoming mountains were showcased by the setting sun. Liberty was on the far right, Haystack, which looked taller because it is closer was to the left of center, and Lincoln and Lafayette were on the left. They were beautiful to look at now, and I'm sure they will be both beautiful and challenging to climb when we meet them up close and personal the day after tomorrow. The time passed quickly as we chatted with Steam, a fellow thru hiker who opted to work for stay.  From northern Georgia, he began his thru hike the day after I did, on April 8th. We've passed each other a few times before but haven't spent any time together before. He has a wonderful sense of humor, and we had a great time talking and laughing down by the lake. We also shared some time with Momma Duck who brought her babies up to introduce them while we waited. It's pretty obvious that she's used to handouts, but not only are there signs not to feed the ducks, we didn't have anything for them anyway.  As thru hikers, there are seldom leftovers, or even crumbs. It was around 8:00 when we were invited in for dinner. It was fabulous and consisted of stuffed pasta shells, green salad, pasta salad, bean soup, and berry cobbler for dessert. I went back for seconds on everything and added some vegetarian lasagna as well. While we ate, we chatted with several of the guests, most of whom shared stories of their love for the Whites.  After dinner, it was time for the ""work"" part of work for stay. Those who know me will not be surprised that I landed the job of head dishwasher.  For several years I have been an official ""Dishwasher for Jesus"" during our annual Knights of Columbus fish fries during Lent.  I immediately fell into my comfort zone and made short work of the pile of dirty dishes. Tracy, the head cook for today was impressed enough with our work to ask if we wanted to stay tomorrow as well, but we will have to be moving on. Special  thanks to Tracy and all of the crew at Lonesome Lake Hut for making me feel so welcome and feeding me so well. Our plan for tomorrow is to get an early start and to hike to the Liberty Springs trailhead to catch a ride with Tiny into Lincoln. There we will resupply and prepare to continue our very challenging, but so far very rewarding, journey through the Whites. Next up is the Presidential range.","Eliza Brook Shelter

We were up early and on the trail by 6:00 this morning. We planned on meeting Tiny at the Liberty Springs parking area near Franconia Notch to share a taxi into Lincoln.  The taxi was scheduled for 10:00, and we wanted to make sure we allowed plenty of time since we weren't sure of the trail conditions. Lonesome Lake had an entirely different beauty in the morning as we hiked by her to begin our day. The trail was the easiest we've seen since northern Vermont, and we made our 10:00 appointment with the taxi with over an hour to spare. The taxi brought us directly to Notch Hostel where we spent the rest of the day getting clean, resting, and eating. Bookie runs the Notch Hostel with lots of help from her canine friend and trail dog, Star, aka No Shame. She helps Bookie run the hostel and is expert at ""yogi-ing"" food (begging without appearing to beg) and takes very good care of her human.  You can tell she is a true trail dog. Bookie is very friendly and made me feel right at home.  She thru hiked with No Shame in 2015, and is obviously deeply in love with the AT and its community. Unfortunately, she ""stole"" one of my ideas and has already published a calendar of privies on the AT.  Oh well, I'm sure there is room for more than one calendar about such an important topic. Thank you, Bookie, for making my stay at Notch Hostel so wonderful.  I got a chance to have my first conversation with Bartender today.  I first met her way back at Trail Angel Mary's hiker feed. We have seen each other several times since but got our first chance to talk today. She and I talked about how the trail continually provides what you need to keep you going and how it can be seen as a metaphor for real life post-trail.  It was a great conversation and was a real pick-me-up. I met Socks today at the hostel as he was giving orientations. He has been recovering from an illness and is doing work for stay by introducing new people to the hostel.  He is a natural, and he told me he has already been interviewed for a job at the hostel after he finishes his thru hike. He would be great at the position, and I wish him the best both in finishing his hike and in his future employment opportunities. Polecat caught a shuttle to Gorman this morning to get his car and drove back to Lincoln. After Polecat arrived, we drove into Lincoln for dinner and resupply.  We ate at the Woodstock Inn, a brewery/restaurant, and I had a turkey/ham sandwich and fries which were very tasty and a passable Scottish ale. We then went to resupply at Price Chopper. I went to bed early. The shuttle to the trailhead leaves tomorrow at 7:45. I have a big day ahead of me tomorrow as I hike up Franconia ridge.  The challenge of the Whites continues.","Lonesome Lake Hut

I was awake by six o'clock after a good night sleep. I had completed my journal and uploaded my photos before going to bed last night. No matter, I still woke up around midnight. I decided to review the nearly 3,000 photos from my trip thus far and was able to delete about 200 as duplicates. It was rather nostaalgic to review my journey all the way from the car trip to Georgia up to the present. The shuttle back to the trailhead was scheduled for 7:45, and all three of us were on it. The goal was Garfield Ridge Shelter, some ten miles ahead. The climb up to Franconia Ridge, which contains Little Haystack Mountain, as well as Mounts Lincoln and Lafayette, was demanding but not particularly difficult. I described it to a passing hiker as being on a Stairmaster with great scenery. He added that the stairs were rough and uneven but understood what I meant.  Nonetheless, the initial climb gained 2,851 feet in 2.7 miles. I then hiked through a short saddle before adding an additional 517 feet to the summit of Little Haystack Mountain. The summit is above tree line, and I would hike along the treeless Franconia Ridge for over two miles as I crossed over Mount Lincoln and Mount Lafayette. The air was chilly with a pronounced wind, but I was comfortable enough that I never even rolled down my sleeves.  The view was stunning in all directions.  Lonesome Lake was clearly visible,  and I'm sure I could have seen the dock I was standing on yesterday morning through binoculars. From the summit of Little Haystack, you can see the entire trail to Mount Lincoln. I admired the view from Haystack before continuing along the 0.7 miles that led to Mount Lincoln. The views were simular and equally amazing.  A local hiker pointed out Mount Washington, my objective in a few day's time, to me. Featureless in its outline, it still managed to look tall and foreboding in the distance. As with Haystack, the mile-long route between Lincoln and Lafayette is clearly visible along its entire route. I reached Mount Lafayette, at a height of 5,263 feet, without any difficulty, although the trail was more difficult than it looked from a distance. I was almost a mile high as I took in the views from the summit. Looking like a small model, Greenleaf Hut was clearly visible as I hiked along the ridge. While it looked close, a challenging 1.2 mile side trail led to the hut from the peak. Instead, I opted to hike the additional 3.9 miles along the AT to Garfield Ridge Shelter/Campsite. The trail down from Franconia Ridge was more challenging than the climb up had been. I soon was below tree line and was back among the spruce and other trees.  The ensuing climb up Mount Garfield would prove to be the most difficult trail of the day, although not as difficult as Kinsman or Smarts had been.  The foundation of an old fire towers remains on Garfield's summit. On a whim, I took off my pack and climbed up to the summit.  I was required to crawl up a steep rock face with my hands and feet wedged into a crevice along the way, but I managed to make it to the top. Steam was inside the foundation, taking a break before heading down the mountain to the shelter. Getting back to the trail from the summit provided me with a slightly different problem, and I ended up sitting on the rock face and sliding down it while slowing my descent by holding onto the edges of the crevice. It was a bit hairy, and I ended up sliding a bit faster than I had hoped, but I was able to stop my slide at the bottom of the rock face with no real difficulty. The view from Garfield was also amazing, and the sinking sun provided some color to the clouds. I then began the final half mile of my day by beginning the descent of Mount Garfield. The going was slow and steep, but I soon arrived at the side trail to the shelter area.  A pretty stream provided water, and I stopped to fill my bottles before following the 0.2 mile trail to the campsite. At the stream, I met Steve and Christy from Houston. They are hiking the Whites, and we discussed the recent devastation caused by the hurricane. Although I am largely insulated from current events, I've heard something about the hurricane and the resulting damage. Fortunately, their home survived,  but many of their friends and family members were not so lucky. Mother Nature certainly has a way of reminding us who is really in charge. I arrived at the campsite and met Ryan, the caretaker of the site. A recent college graduate, Ryan landed the job of caretaker after working for the AMC as a trail maintainer. We had a great chat as I set up my tent in a little secluded grove down from the shelter. As happens so often, I am again refreshed by the quality of the young people I meet on this trail. Ryan also provided me with information to help me plan out the rest of my trip through the Whites.  I set my tent up along the edge of the site to provide room for Gravity and Polecat, but they did not make it here tonight. My guess is they decided to find a stealth site along Garfield Pond, which is located prior to the final ascent. I had arrived at the site at 6:00 but still needed my headlamp to finish cooking dinner, which I did at the shelter.  Several other hikers from the Notch are also here tonight. It's become quite chilly, and the forecast for the morning is for temperatures in the mid-thirties. Rain is in the forecast for Thursday, which may affect my planning, as I have no inclination to climb Mount Washington in the rain. We'll work all that out in the upcoming days. For right now, I'm going to snuggle back down into my sleeping bag and get some more sleep so I'll be ready for more hiking in the Whites tomorrow.","Franconia Notch/Liberty Springs trailhead/Notch Hostel

Dawn brought crisp, cool air, and I broke camp and was ready to go by 7:30. Gravity and Polecat did not make it in last night, and none of the northbound hikers who came in last night reported seeing them. With no way to find out where they were, I decided to go ahead and hike forward, figuring we can get things sorted out later down the trail.  The descent down Garfield was very steep and was complicated for awhile by sharing space with the stream that cascaded down the mountain from the spring near the campsite.  A relatively flat section followed before the ascent up South Twin Mountain began. The climb up was steep but more predictable than most. It primarily consisted of climbing up irregular stone, and I only had to resort to hand and foot climbing perhaps a dozen times on my way to the top. I posed for a photo at the top as I enjoyed the 360 degree views. A day hiker offered me a pepperoni sandwich, that I gratefully accepted.  The trail along the ridge led through a sparse woods of short trees that allowed the sun to shine on me. The descent from the ridge today was one of the least difficult I have encountered in the Whites. Zealand Falls and its Hut lie at the bottom, and the trail is heavily used by day hikers, which may be why it seemed like more care was taken to provide stone stairs through the steeper parts. I made it all the way to the hut without much difficulty. The trail north of the falls follows an old railroading grade for several miles, which provided very easy hiking for awhile this afternoon. It became obvious that camp was getting close, because, true to the AT way, rocks returned. At least the trail remained relatively flat. I was able to cover over fourteen miles today and arrived at Ethan Pond Campsite at 6:30. The pond is beautiful and popular with anglers.  I got water at the stream that flows into the pond, and went to set up camp.  Nora, the caretaker at the site, offered to help me set up my tent on a raised, wooden platform, since there are few conventional tent sites. Always willing to try something new, I gave it a go. By driving the stakes into cracks between the boards and utilizing some of the eyelets along the edges, I soon had my tent ready to go.  Thanks, Nora, for teaching an old dog a new trick.  After I was set up for the night, I went down to the pond and caught the very end of sunset. It was a beautiful site. Unfortunately, the forecast is for rain tomorrow with snow in the higher elevations. Friday's forecast is reported to be highs in the twenties with strong winds. It looks like my hike to the summit of Mount Washington will need to be delayed. My plan is to hike to Crawford Notch tomorrow and catch a shuttle into town to wait out the storm. Mount Washington is one of the deadliest mountains with very unpredictable and dangerous weather. I plan on getting up early to try to beat the rain and will just need to wait for a good time to climb to the summit.","Garfield Ridge Shelter/Campsite

The weather report for Mount Washington continued to be poor today, with rain and white-out conditions in the forecast.  An advisory was issued warning against attempting to climb it. I got up early to make sure I made it to the shuttle pick-up point by 10:30, as I didn't know the trail conditions coming off the mountain. As it turned out, I had nothing to worry about and was at the Willey Store by 9:00. I left at the same time that Mona did, and we hiked together the entire way to the store. The 2.9 miles proved to be quite easy trail, and we spent our time talking about all sorts of topics.  Inspired by a co-worker who battled cancer, Mona set out from Damascus in May to complete a flip-flop thru hike with no previous backpacking experience. Mona recently went back to school and plans on becoming a social worker to help people who are striving to overcome addictions. She is obviously an empathetic, compassionate person and will undoubtedly help many people in her future.  The time and miles flew by while we talked, and we soon found ourselves off the mountain and then to where we would meet our shuttle. The store opened at 9:30, and the group of hikers waiting for the shuttle spent our time talking and eating. Bookie from Notch Hostel was right on time, and I soon found myself back at the hostel. We got a shuttle into Lincoln at 2:00, ate lunch at the Gypsy Cafe, and resupplied. I only needed a few things, which I got at Dollar General. I also bought some items to pitch in for our spaghetti feast planned for tonight.  The forecast for tomorrow remains grim with dangerously low temperatures and very high winds.  While only cool and windy in Lincoln, the tops of the mountains were covered in fog as the storm and winds continued. Radio was in town after attempting to climb to Franconia Ridge this morning. He and some friends hiked a short distance and was confronted with the weather and came back off the mountain. Mount Washington is considered the most deadly of the ""small"" mountains and is nothing to trifle with.  The weather Saturday looks promising. Unfortunately, there is a 100% chance of rain on Sunday. Right now my thought is to get to at least Mizpah Spring Hut on Saturday and then hole up there if need be on Sunday. The power of Mother Nature is readily apparent in these mountains. I enjoyed a fun evening in the common room of the hostel before heading for bed. Hopefully, there won't be too many more weather-related delays as I close in on Katahdin.","Ethan Pond Campsite

The weather on Mount Washington remained problematic, so there was no hiking today.  I got online and checked out the weather cam from the summit. It was quite impressive but no where you would want to be. Ice, low twenties, and high winds are the name of the game today. I talked to Becky, and she told me that she read that the record low for September 1st on Mount Washington is 24 degrees. Today it was 25 degrees with freezing fog. Tomorrow is supposed to be better, and my plan is to get as early a start as possible and push for Lakes of the Clouds Hut. It will be an eleven mile hike over Mounts Webster, Jackson, Pierce, Eisenhower, Franklin, and Monroe, as I walk up the ridge line. I will probably have to hole up at the hut on Sunday, as there is presently a 90% chance of rain. From there, I hope to take two more days to get to Madison Spring Hut or Osgood Tent Site the first day and then to Pinkham Notch the second day. Of course, these days will be dependent on weather conditions. I walked into the kitchen this morning and found two large plates of cookies that Gandalf baked. The price per cookie: one compliment to Gandalf. I rapidly learned that he was hot (from Mona) and that he takes compliments well (from Wolf Dog). I complimented him on his knowledge of Harry Potter. He then informed me that today, September 1st, 2017, is the exact date of the epilogue in Book 7. So today is the day that young Albus Severus Potter gets on the train for Hogwarts for the first time.  I'll bet Kings Cross Station is buzzing today.  I later passed by as Gandalf, who is just shy of six feet, seven inches tall, squeezed into the tiny restroom on the third floor of the hostel. It reminded me of Harry Potter living in the Cupboard Under the Stairs on 4 Privett Drive. The restroom, while small, is not dusty and I saw no spiders. In honor of Epilogue Day, however, I decided to take a picture anyway. The Notch Hostel was full tonight, and Serena, one of the owners, was kind enough to open her apartment for Dancing Bear, Gandolf, and me. Once again, the staff of Notch Hostel comes through in a big way to help me out.  Thanks so much! After settling in, I went for a walk in Lincoln. I stopped at Udderly Delicious, an ice cream store near Serena's apartment. I met the owner, Mary Jo, who had just made a prototype apple crisp, which I ordered with ice cream. It was delicious. Mary Jo also works as an aide with students with special needs, and we had a tremendous conversation about our students and their education.  It was wonderful to talk with someone who understands special students and their needs. Thank you, Mary Jo, for helping to make my afternoon! In fact, our conversation made me so hungry that I then ordered a large chocolate malt. I went back to the apartment and simply chilled until I decided to go for dinner.  There is a pizza shop right beside the apartment, and I ordered a large steak and mushroom sub and a garden salad. I packed everything I could, so I can be ready for an early shuttle tomorrow.  I have eleven miles to go tomorrow to Lakes of the Clouds Hut. Hopefully, I can summit Mount Washington the next day, but the weather is doubtful. The best way to approach this seems to be one day at a time.  I've had a laid-back, enjoyable day, and I feel ready to get back to hiking tomorrow. And, again, Happy Epilogue Day to all the Harry Potter fans out there. May your wands never backfire and your spells always be for the good.","Crawford Notch, US 302/Notch Hostel

I slept well in Serena's apartment and was up early to make sure I was ready for the shuttle. I was a bit worried that I would get too late a start to ensure getting to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, a distance of eleven miles, before dark. The shuttle arrived right on time at 7:00 and headed for the trailhead after brief stops at an ATM and at Dunkin' Donuts.  It was a forty-five mile drive to the trailhead, and I was back on the trail at 8:30. I enjoy my time in town, but it felt good to be hiking again. The climb up Mount Webster was steep and long, but it held no surprises. There were numerous hand and feet scrambles but nothing that made me particularly nervous. The trail led out onto the Webster Cliffs, which provided some great views. From one point, I could look down and see the Willey Store, which is located near the trailhead. It served as an obvious reminder of how high I had climbed to get there. There were good views from the summit of Mount Webster as well. I was now on the ridgeline, so, while there would still be a lot of ups and downs today as I hiked up and over Mt. Jackson, Mount Pierce, and Mount Franklin, they were never particularly long. I would spend most of the time above tree line watching Mount Washington grow ever closer. It is so different to be able to see what is coming up after so many miles of hiking in tree cover. It was a beautiful Saturday, and the trail was busy with day hikers. Many asked me if I were thru hiking, and I chatted briefly with many of them. I'm sure the trail was far more empty yesterday due to the cold weather and winds. I did meet a sobo who told me that he chose to summit yesterday, although he added it probably wasn't the wisest thing he had ever done. I'm hoping the weather proves good enough for me to be able to reach the summit tomorrow.  There was no trouble reaching today'a destination, as I arrived at the Lakes of the Clouds Hut at 6:00, still comfortably before nightfall. The Lakes of the Clouds Hut sits a mere mile and a half from the summit of Mount Washington. Of course, it probably won't feel like there is anything ""mere"" about it when I am actually hiking it. I was offered a choice of sleeping arrangements for tonight. My first option was in the Dungeon. The Dungeon is the emergency area at the Lands of the Clouds Hut for when the weather turns trully nasty.  It also serves as a place for thru hikers to stay, since there is no tenting allowed over tree line.  It is quite dank and uninviting. The cost to stay in the dungeon: $10.00.  The cost for a place on the dining room floor: $15.00. Best extra $5.00 I ever spent, as I paid for my floor space. Unfortunately, there were no additional work for stay spots, so I had to scrounge up my own dinner as well as pay the $15.00 fee.  Oh well, it will make my pack lighter.  I went to look at the lake for which Lakes of the Clouds is named, although there is only one lake in evidence. Created by a glacier, it's a beautiful little lake with the summit of Mount Washington in the background. It is also home for fragile, endangered plants and an endangered butterfly.  The White Mountain Fritillary is a species of butterfly whose ancestors arrived during the time of the glaciers. As the ice receded and temperatures warmed, the plants on which the butterfly depended on for food were overwhelmed by warm weather plants. The colder temperatures in the higher altitude by Mount Washington provides a refuge for the few remaining Fritillaries. They are presently endangered primarily by warming temperatures. It's amazing what you can learn by reading the posters on the wall of a hut while waiting for the paying customers to go to bed so you can sleep on the dining room floor. I went outside in the rapidly cooling temperatures to get a look at the sunset. It was a beautiful moment on a clear nigh.  I'm not sure what the weather will be tomorrow, but I will be warm and dry tonight regardless of what tomorrow holds.","Serena's apartment in Lincoln

The forecast was not good when I got up this morning. The rain was supposed to start later in the morning, so Gravity and Polecat (who were also at the hut) and I decided to hike to the summit and then calling it a day from there. There was a strong wind and cool temperatures, but the sun was shining when we left the hut.  The gusts continued to increase as we gained altitude. The sky was chaotic, and I was able to observe three simultaneous weather phenomena behind me. There was a rainbow to my left, while a shaft of bright sunlight illuminated a building near the center, and rain was definitely falling to the right. It was quite a sight, and I risked getting my phone out to take a picture. Polecat and Gravity resembled astronauts walking on the moon as they struggled against the seventy-mile winds we encountered on our way to the summit. The buildings on the summit could have been some future lunar base.  It was actually quite exciting, and we commented it was like a ride at an amusement park. We made it to the summit as the wind really picked up, and we struggled to get our pictures taken at the summit sign. In order to get my photo, I had to crawl to the sign and use it to stand back up. I held tightly to the sign to keep from being blown backwards. Polecat sat on a rock to take the photo. We then exchanged places. Gandalf, who summitted yesterday, told me that there were 200 people in line at the summit (you can also drive or take a cog railway to the summit) when he arrived during the perfect weather yesterday. We didn't have that problem this morning, although some people began to show up as we were finishing because the cog railway had just arrived.  I would love to ride the cog railway someday, perhaps in some future vacation.  The weather then trully turned nasty, with hard gusting wind, white-out conditions, and a misty rain. There is a sign at the summit, noting that the fastest wind speed of all time, 231 miles per hour, was recorded on the summit. While we didn't encounter anything of that magnitude, it was still way impressive enough.  Mount Washington is the deadliest mountain in the United States, and there is a list of the 157 people who have perished there mounted on a wall of the visitor's center. Most deaths were from hypothermia, falls, and cardiac arrest. There is room for additional names, so Polecat, Gravity, and I decided not to test the mountain, and will continue our hike on a future day.  We took the shuttle down the mountain. Alexa, who drove our shuttle down from the summit, shared several stories of drivers with cars that broke down, or that had break downs themselves and had to have someone come and complete the drive for them. The road was narrow and steep, but we were in good hands with Alexa at the wheel. We also received a coupon, so our trip back up the mountain, hopefully tomorrow, will be free. We relaxed at the Pinkham Notch Visitor's Center for a bit, before getting a shuttle ride back to the Notch Hostel so Polecat could get his car.  After retreiving his car and chatting a bit with Bookie, we drove to Gotham and booked a room at the Royalty Inn. We managed to get a room with three beds, which made me feel like royalty, indeed. I always volunteer to sleep on the floor whenever we are short a bed, so it's nice to have a real bed. After checking in, we went to dinner in Gorham at a very classy restaurant named SAalt. The food was excellent. We had a pleasant surprise when our server introduced herself as Base Weight, who started the trail about the same time I did. While I don't think we met while she was hiking, I remember hearing about a hiker who left the trail because she bought a house in Gorham. It was Base Weight, and we shared some tales from the trail. After dinner, we resupplied and headed back to the hotel. With four days of food, I'm hoping to not need another resupply until I've hiked back to Gorham, which will mean the completion of the Whites. The weather is supposed to be better tomorrow, and Polecat is taking us to meet the shuttle back up the mountain. He will then head back home. Thanks again, Polecat for sharing in this little adventure.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

The conditions on Mount Washington were quite breezy this morning with sustained winds of 70 mph and gusts of over 90 mph. The forecast was for no rain and diminishing winds, so we decided to give it a go. The shuttle was scheduled for 9:00 and we were there in plenty of time.  Polecat dropped us off and said goodbye. He is such a great friend and hiking partner, and I will miss hiking with him. Thanks again, Polecat, for joining the trek!  Dove was also on the shuttle up the mountain, and we all decided to stick together until the weather improved. The wind at the summit had dropped a bit, but it was still very blustry with sustained winds of over 50 mph and complete cloud cover. We started out a bit after ten and found a white blaze. We followed to the next white blaze, and then a third. I followed that blaze, right back to the door of the visitor's center!  Never one to be afraid to ask directions, I found an employee who kindly showed us the correct path and we were off.  The going was challenging as the wind buffeted us around as we stepped from rock to rock on our way down from the summit.  We made sure to keep each other in sight and moved carefully.  True to the forecast, the wind diminished and eventually the sun came out.  We could see Mount Washington receding in the distance as Mount Madison grew larger before us.  The trail consisted of stepping from one uneven, jagged boulder to the next for the entire day. It made for difficult, challenging hiking that required non-stop attention to the placement of feet and trekking poles. Factor in strong, gusting winds; wet, misty fog; and limited visibility, and you have my morning today. By afternoon, the sun was out and the skies were clear, but the rugged, rocky terrain remained. We covered 5.7 very tough miles today, with only about 0.2 miles being what you would call trail. Again, it is amazing how fast something can become the new norm, and I scrambled from rock cairn to rock cairn all day long, without much thought.  While we were still a few miles from Madison Spring Hut, a young woman passed us, and we struck up a conversation.  She asked where we were headed, and I told her we were for sure headed for the hut but might try to continue on to a camping area a few miles past if possible. It turned out she worked at the hut and encouraged us to consider the tentsite area since it is below tree line, and it is supposed to rain tomorrow. The trail continued to be slow going for a couple of old men, and, while we made it to the hut well before dark, there was no way we had time to hike the additional 3.1 miles to the tentsite. We arrived at 6:30 to find the hut staff waiting for us. Chisa, the young woman we met on the trail, had given the rest of the staff a heads up about our upcoming arrival.  We were greeted enthusiastically, and were immediately offered work for stay, which we readily accepted. Zak, another of the staff members, signed us up. Chisa let me know there were free unlimited pancakes available right away, so I helped myself to two. I was asked to take as many as I could, as the rest would have to be hauled off the mountain as waste. I took six, and Zak added syrup. Gravity and I sat at a bench while the paying customers ate. After dinner, Tim, the resident geologist, gave a fascinating presentation on how the Whites were formed and why there are so many rocks. Let's hear it for glaciers!  We were then invited to eat all of the dinner we wanted, and I feasted on beef, couscous, peas, and homemade cookie bars.         Gravity and I then scoured baking pans for our work for stay. Once again, my dishwashing prowess was put to the test. We scoured the pans and then washed up all of the rest of the dishes from the evening. Zak and Chisa asked if we could stick around for a few days until all of the other pans were scoured, but we told them we would need to leave early in the morning. Two miles of rugged trail still remain before we are back below tree line, and we are 7.8 miles from Pinkham Notch, the objective for tomorrow. Zak, Chisa, and Tim chatted with us before we all went to bed. Chisa thru hiked the AT in 2014 and the PCT in 2016. She also spent four months hiking the Te Araroa trail, a 1,800 mile trek through New Zealand. Once again, I feel so blessed by the people I meet on the trail. Thanks to all of the staff at Madison Springs Hut for your friendly welcome and kindness! Lights out was at 9:30, and I gladly turned in for the night. The weather does not look good for the next few days, and we plan on an early start tomorrow to try to at least get below tree line before any rain begins. The wind is blowing vigorously outside the hut as I write this, reminding me once again of the power, as well as the beauty, of these mountains.","Mount Washington Summit/Gorham, NH

I got up at 5:00 this morning to assure an early start for summitting Mount Madison. Madison has a reputation (well deserved, it turned out) of being a real challenge. Rain was in the forecast, and I really wanted to get over the mountain, down the ridge line, and back in tree cover before it started. Today was perhaps the most difficult day of hiking I have ever experienced. The trail was like yesterday with rugged, jagged boulders to traverse, marked periodically by cairns of stone. The wind was phenominal the entire time I was above tree line. I met a southbound hiker who is familiar with the Whites, and he told me we were experiencing wind speeds of 80 mph. The trail from the hut to the summit is 0.5 miles long, and it took us over two hours to reach the summit. There were places were I literally crawled from boulder to boulder, with my clothing flapping frantically in the wind. It was quite exciting.  Gravity and I holed up against a large boulder and took a summit photo together. Things were no different after the summit. The trail off of Madison lies directly along the top of the ridge line all the way to the trees. There was about a mile that we were completely exposed to the wind as we worked our way across. I stayed on the upwind side of the ridge, so if a sudden gust blew me over, it would be into the rock and not over the edge. I lost my Zseat  (a type of foam sitting pad) when it was blown off the back of my pack. I almost lost my puffy jacket, which I had in the mesh pouch on the back. Of course I couldn't see it, but the hood came out and was acting like a parasail trying to pull out the rest of the jacket. Fortunately, Gravity was behind me and shoved it back in. I kept working my way down the ridge, and things got easier after I got among trees. It's obvious how much wind occurs there, because the evergreens only have branches on the downwind side.  The rest of the descent to Osgood Tent Site was quite steep and very slick from the rain a few days before, but it was made easier by being sheltered from the wind. It took me six and a half hours to hike the 3.1 miles from the hut to the tent site. I was tempted to continue on to Pinkham Notch, an additional 4.7 miles down, but the skies were tbreatening, and I decided I'd had enough excitement for one day. I spent the time waiting for Gravity by setting up my tent and chatting with a flip-flop hiker named Bagel. Gravity seemed quite satisified with my decision to stop, and the rain began to fall soon after he arrived. It was still early, but I was quite content to chill out in my tent listening to the rain.  It stopped around six, but I had pretty much decided just to stay in bed, when I heard a dog bark. It sounded like Maple. It was Maple, and I had a joyous reunion with her and with Jason and Boomer, whom I haven't seen since New York. Red Eye jumped forward due to her visa expiring and will summit Katahdin in a few days. It was great seeing them again, and we all cooked dinner and filled each other in on our latest exploits. They are hiking with Single T, a hiker I met previously at the Notch. Just as it began to get dark, a thunderstorm began again in earnest, and everyone headed for their tents and hammocks. I plan on an early start tomorrow, and if the weather isn't too terrible, I hope to make it to the Carter Notch Hut, a distance of 10.6 miles. As I have learned, however, the Whites have a way of altering my plans in any number of ways, and most of the Wildcat Mountains stand between me and the hut.  I'm continuing to take my time and focus on the moment, which I feel is the best possible approach. While incredibly challenging and difficult, I continue to enjoy my time in the Whites and am making memories that will last me a long time. The rain continues to fall now with thunder rumbling in the distance, and I'm going back to sleep to be ready for tomorrow.","Madison Spring Hut

I was awake and moving at 5:30 because my plan was to hike up and over the Wildcat Mountains today, despite the probability of rain today. The Wildcats are reported to have a very difficult, steep ascent for northbounders with a good deal of slick rock faces to traverse. The initial ascent is nearly 2,000 in two miles with an additional 432 feet of elevation to get to the highest of the Wildcat peaks. It rained steadily during the night, but I was able to break camp during a break in the rain. The initial 4.7 miles to Pinkham Notch was quite easy, but things rapidly changed after the notch. A light, steady rain began to fall soon after I left camp, which continued throughout the day, with a few breaks.  The rain definitely made the climb up the Wildcats more interesting, and I was very careful the entire way up. I slipped a few times but never seriously. As reported, the climb was very steep, with many opportunities to scramble up and over large, rugged boulders. The most difficult sections required hiking up steeply slanted, slick rock faces. I made much use of the trees that grow alongside the rock faces, and I did a great deal of crawling on my hands and feet. The most challenging place involved a twenty foot tall v-shaped notch with rocks wedged in the notch starting about half way up. There was no way for me to climb in the notch. I finally figured out how to pull myself onto the side of one of the rock faces by lying on my stomach and pulling myself up with my arms. It was a bit precarious, but I was able to swing my leg up onto the rock. I was able to wiggle my way up to the first wedged rock and then scramble to the top of the notch. It was the single most difficult climbing move I have had to manage for the entire trip. As difficult as the ascent was, it was not as precarious as the last few days with non-ending strong winds trying to blow me off a mountain. The rain kept the rocks slick, but it will take days of dry weather before the rocks are dry, and if you don't hike in the rain, then you don't make it to Maine. I made it to the top with no real problem. There were lots of clouds, but I climbed the small observation deck on the top of Wildcat Mountain Peak B, which is also home to a Ski Gondola. My guidebook states that there are Gondola rides to and from the AT for $12.00 round trip, but the operation was abandoned today.  I guess chilly, rainy weather is not conducive to gondola rides. was a view of sorts. The Wildcats are comprised of five peaks along a single ridge. They never go above tree line, so I was better protected from the winds. The descent down the mountain was steep but mostly stair-stepped, so getting down to the hut was fairly easy. I much prefer it this way, as do most hikers. I would rather go up steeply than down. I arrived at the hut at five o'clock. Unfortunately, there were no available work for stay positions available, but Helen, one of the crew, said I would be able to work for about half an hour so I could sleep in the hut. I spent the evening chatting with some fellow hikers and writing my journal. When it came time to eat, all of the thru hikers decided to share the available leftovers, so I got to eat after all.  In addition to washing dishes, I also swept the floor of the hut. The floor glittered with what I thought might be pixie dust, until Josh, the resident geologist, informed me it was dust from the mica that is found in the region. I may just go on believing that it's pixie dust.  My plan tomorrow is to leave early and plan on stopping at Imp Campsite, which is 7.2 miles away. Gorham is an additional eight miles beyond that. I don't think I can manage 15.2 miles in the Whites, so I will probably split it into two days. My thought remains to make sure I always allow enough time in a day that I never have to worry about hiking after dark.  My time in the Whites has not surprisingly slowed my progress but has been an incredible experience that will give me many stories with which to bore my friends for years.","Osgood Tent Site

I was up before 5:30 and ready to hit the trail by 7:00. My initial goal was to make it to the Imp Campsite which was 7.2 miles away. After thanking the crew one last time, I headed out. A light rain had been falling earlier but stopped by the time I left.  There was a beautiful view of the pond near the hut with mountains above, and I paused to take a picture.  The first objective today was to climb Carter Dome. The ascent was a challenge but mostly straightforward. The clouds had cleared somewhat, and there was a good view on the way up. At one point on the trail, I had to work my way up a narrow crevice. It took a while to puzzle it out, but I made it up. The summit was completely in the clouds, so I lost any opportunity for views as I left Carter Dome and hiked on to Mount Hight. The descent from Hight was one of the most challenging yet. It was quite steep with very slick, wet rock faces. At one point, the trail followed down a waterfall, so water flowed over my shoes as I worked my way down. As much as I could, I used trees growing adjacent to the trail to my advantage. At one point, I was holding onto a tree as I worked my way along the top edge of a very steep rock slope. My feet completely slipped out from under me, and I landed hard on my right side. Fortunately, I was able to maintain my hold on the tree as my hands slipped down it. Otherwise, things might not have gone so well. As it was, I rolled over to a sitting position, held my trekking poles in front of me, and let go of the tree. I had about a fifteen foot slide down the rock face and was able to stop at the end of the ledge by forcing my feet and trekking poles against a raised edge. It was somewhat precarious and quite exciting and got me down to the next level. I slipped several other times and am a bit bruised and scraped up on my legs and elbows, but I managed to get down to Zeta Pass relatively unscathed.  The skies cleared as I headed up Middle and then North Carter Mountains, providing some very nice views. As the sun shone on the trail, I noticed that it sparkled.  The mica that formed the pixie dust on the hut floor was quite prevalent in the rocks on the trail as well. I also passed some very pretty flowers with bright red berries. The leaves on many of them were already changing color, another indication that fall will be in full swing soon.  The descent from North Carter, while still steep and wet, was less severe, and I arrived at Imp Campsite by 2:30.  I stopped at the shelter and got water from a fast flowing brook. I assessed the situation and felt it was too early to stop for the day. I was a bit bruised and sore but otherwise felt fine. I checked my Guthooks app and found a comment that there was a small stealth camp site, big enough for two tents, about 0.2 miles north of the summit of Mount Moriah, which was 2.1 miles away. It was a bit of a gamble, since you can hike for miles in these mountains without seeing any potential campsite, but I decided to give it a go. The ascent was not overly challenging, although there were numerous places where I needed to use my hands and feet as I crawled and pulled myself up using rock edges, trees, and roots. As I neared the summit, the trail became increasingly boggy between the rock faces, and a few places it resembled a pond more than a trail. There was nothing for it but to wade on through, so my feet and shoes were soaked as I then proceeded to walk up and over slanted rock faces. Fortunately, the rock faces on Moriah are rougher than most, and I was usually able to simply walk up them without slipping too badly. I came across the tiniest of trees, growing in a little spot of dirt on a rock face near a cairn. I guess life will always find a way to happen, given the slightest of opportunities. Near the summit, I met Soars, Alton, and their puppy, Cole (aka Super Puppy). These three love to hike in the Whites, and we all paused our respective adventures to chat. Soars thru hiked the AT in 2009 and the PCT in 2016. He hopes to complete his triple crown by hiking the Continental Divide Trail next year. I first met them as they passed me on their way to the summit, where we helped each other out by taking photos at a view, and then again on their way back down. We had a much more extensive conversation then.  Some people just exude a joyful nature, and that is certainly true of Soars (""like the eagle, not the thing you put cream on"") and Alton. Cole tended to be a bit standoffish, but I guess he's just shy. Our chat really lifted my spirits, and as we parted ways, the muddy bogs and the steep, slick rocks didn't seem so bad. Well met, and good luck on that triple crown!  As we talked, I was reminded of a story that Dove related to me. The day we came off of Mount Washington due to the storm, she was sitting in the cafe at the Pinkham Notch Visitor's Center near a couple who had also decided that perhaps hiking that day was not such a good idea. Another person asked the couple if they were thru hiking, and the young woman misunderstood and said, ""Yes, I'm through hiking, and I don't know if I'll ever do it again!"" Now I know why we are ""thru hikers"" and not ""through hikers.""  After parting with Soars, Alton, and Cole, I soon came to the summit of Mount Moriah. She is the last of the White Mountains for a nobo, and I'll leave the Whites when I reach Gorham tomorrow. I found a small tent spot after beginning the descent of Moriah, nestled in amongst the evergreens. I realized as I was writing this that today is my five month anniversary of beginning my hike.  While I am a bit behind where I thought I would be, I am still in good stead to complete in plenty of time. The Whites have proven to be a huge challenge, and I understand that southern Maine will be more of the same. I'm enjoying the challenge and, while I continue to feel a bit apprehensive of what lies ahead, I'll continue to give it my best all the way to Katahdin.","Carter Notch Hut

I was up and moving again before 5:30.  The days continue to get noticeably shorter, so I'm trying to get as early a start as possible. I was on trail at 6:40 and was pleased to see that I had already done the most difficult part of the descent last night. It was an odd feeling to be saying goodbye to the Whites.  I had been told that the last few miles into Gorham would be the easiest trail I had seen in a long time, and I found that to be true. In fact, I arrived at a bridge so early that I became totally disoriented. I told myself that there was no way I could be there that early. I'd forgotten that I can hike more than two miles per hour on easy trail. I am so glad that I hiked into the evening yesterday, as I arrived at the White Mountain Hostel just a bit after 10:00.  I was able to get my clothes in to be washed, and hung out my jackets, my sleeping bag, and my tent on a clothes line to dry. I showered for the first time in a while. I ordered a cheeseburger from a local restaurant that delivers and caught up with my journal. I expect Maine to be even more sparse with phone service, so I will be uploading my entries when I can. My understanding is that southern Maine is every bit as difficult as the Whites, so I still have my work cut out for me. The friction from my slide down the rock face yesterday burned through a strap on my pack that is used to keep tension on the stay rod. I was able to do a field repair that I hope will hold. I'm just thankful that it wasn't a shoulder strap. I took the 6:00 shuttle to Wal-Mart, and our driver, Mellow, told us it would be the last one we would see until after Katahdin. I resupplied for four days. I ended up purchasing a rather eclectic dinner menu for tonight. I bought an entire rotisserie chicken, a peach, a banana, a tub of whole milk cottage cheese, a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli, and two small bags of Cheetos. If that doesn't get me through the rest of New Hampshire and into Maine, I don't know what will.  Without fanfare today I crossed the less than 300 miles to go mark. There are 298.3 miles to the summit of Katahdin. Like all the miles before these, I find it best to concentrate on taking things one step at a time, but it will be exciting to get to Maine, which should happen the day after tomorrow.","Stealth campsite near the summit of Mount Moriah

I woke up at 6:00 this morning, which is late for me. The hostel serves breakfast at 6:30, and I was dressed and ready in time for waffles, coffee cake, bananas, and coffee. Kyle from the hostel was chef of the day and whipped up some mighty fine waffles. I got a chance to talk with him while he cooked and found out that he is also a published author. He writes science fiction and historical fiction under the umbrella title of Penny Punkers. His website is: Officialpennypunkers.weebly.com. His writing sounds very interesting, and I promised to check it out when I get home. I continue to meet so many interesting personalities on this trip. Full of a yummy breakfast, I hiked out at 7:30. Gravity, who took a few days off to rest and heal, accompanied me.  My goal was the Gentian Pond Shelter/Campsite, 11.8 miles away.  The hike, while strenuous, was nothing like the Whites had been, and I made good time for the conditions. Along the way, I ran into Jabba and Buck, who I have not seen since staying at the Hiker Hostel on Old Railroad Grade Road in Roan Mountain, Tennessee.  A father/son team, they had flip/flopped in Pennsylvania and had just finished Maine going southbound.  To make up a section, they hiked northbound today. I called then flip/flop/flippers.  Jabba runs marathons, and we talked about long distance running while we long distanced hiked together this morning. I know how much I enjoyed having my children hike with me, so Buck is a lucky man, indeed. We ate lunch together on the summit of Cascade Mountain while taking in the view. I accidentally stirred up a hive of bees when I set down my pack, but they were not too rattled and none chose to get aggressive. The weather was sunny and cool today with only a brief, very light sprinkling of rain this afternoon. The long distance forecast calls for nice weather for several days, and I hope to take good advantage of it.  There were some steep sections of both ascent and descent today, but for the most part the trail was pretty good. There were also places of very deep, watery mud, with no way around. There are usually rocks and logs you can try hopping between, but sooner or later your shoes end up wet and muddy. There were also places where long lines of boards had been placed, where the bog was so deep you probably would sink up to your chest. These boards are also quite slick so care and attention are required while walking on them. I passed several lakes and ponds today. Dream Lake was particularly beautuful, and I hiked down the short side trail to get a better view. It was well worth the extra time. When I arrived at Wocket Ledge, there wasn't only a view, there was the number 1900 written out in sticks. I have now hiked 1900 miles on my way to Katahdin. Jabba took my picture standing by the number. I arrived at Gentian Pond Campsite at 4:15 and set up my tent. The water source was the pond, and I could see a beaver house out in the water. I carefully filtered my water and, for the first time this trip, added chemicals just to be on the safe side. I had Giardia once many years ago and am not in a hurry to give it a go a second time. I was leisurely preparing dinner when Gravity hiked in. Soon, many hikers arrived, and the tenting area is dotted with more tents and hammocks than I have seen in one place for a long time.  There are many familiar faces including Jabba, Buck, Medieval, Dove, Uncle Puck, and Dancing Bear, as well as Frodo, Samwise, and Gimli. There are several hikers I don't know by name. The shelter is taken up by a group of rowdy short-time hikers and their very cool dogs,  so all of the thru hikers are tenting tonight.  We are all funneling into Maine, which is presently only 4.7 miles away. It's hard to believe I will be in my last state tomorrow. As I mentioned previously, southern Maine is reported to be very challenging, and she wastes no time getting started. My goal tomorrow is Full Goose Shelter/Campsite, which is 9.6 miles north. About a mile and a half past Full Goose is Mahoosuc Notch, which is considered the most difficult and/or fun mile on the entire AT. The trail takes you through a jumbled pit of boulders and there are places where it is necessary to push your pack through small tunnels before wiggling your own way through. It is not uncommon for it to take up to three hours to traverse this single mile. Most hikers, myself included, want to tackle the Notch early in the morning. Mahoosuc Arm, a steep, challenging climb, immediately follows the Notch. There is then another shelter/campsite past the Arm. The total distance between the shelters is ""only"" 5.1 miles, but that will probably be enough distance for one day. Of course, all that fun won't happen until the day after tomorrow.  I did get some exciting news. Dapper Dan, Alex, and Billy all summitted Katahdin today. Dapper Dan texted me their summit photo. I'm full of pride and happiness for them, and it's exciting to see my friends start to complete their journeys. In some ways it seems like a long time ago and in other ways it seems like only yesterday that I met Dapper Dan as he set up his tent near mine on my very first evening on the trail. I met Alex just a few days later, and Billy shortly after that. Space Jam and Reed rounded out that first group of hikers that I spent nearly a month with. I'm sure Juan Gone will summit soon, and then, God willing, it will be my turn. I guess it really is a bit early to get all nostalgic.  Tomorrow's goal is to get into Maine and then to the Full Goose Campsite. As I've said so many times before, one day at a time. It's a bit chilly with a steady breeze blowing in the trees above.  I'm now going back to sleep to be ready for tomorrow.","US 2/White Mountains Hostel

I was up early and left a bit after seven, even though I expected today to be a relatively short day of only 9.6 miles. Once again, I learned I should never underestimate the AT. The hiking was extremely challenging today, and I got into camp at 6:15, less than an hour before sunset.  The climb up Mount Success had a few difficult sections, and the summit was completely socked in when I got there, with no view at all.  I noticed that the clouds were beginning to clear as I descended, but decided not to backtrack to have a look. Fortunately,  there would be ample views later on.  I reached a major milestone today around noon when I passed from New Hampshire to Maine. I am now in my fourteenth and final state. A group of us stopped at the border for lunch, and I ate with Frodo, Rambo, Gimli, Dove, Dancing Bear, Tango, and Uncle Puck.  I set a bit of Beau free, and he is now in every state of the Appalachian Trail.  Southern Maine is known as the most difficult section of the trail, and she wastes no time getting down to business. I had my first encounter with a huge boulder crawl soon after entering the state. The object is to work your way around these cottage sized boulders with smaller ones jumbled in for good measure. If you slip, it is very possible to fall fifteen or twenty feet between the boulders.  As I climbed and descended Mount Carlo and the Goose Eye Mountains (the West, East, and North peaks), I encountered many rock climbs up steep, slick rock faces and a few more huge boulder areas. I again used the roots and trees along the rock faces to my advantage and had many opportunities to crawl on my hands and feet while grasping roots, trees, and the edges of rocks. Puzzling out the boulders was a different matter, which might utilize any number of the above techniques, minus the roots and trees. Numerous times I had to sit down and slide down a rock face to its bottom edge. One area required dropping into a crevice, turning, and then squeezing through a narrow crack to access the next part of a descent. For once, being short and thin worked to my advantage, as I did not have to take off my pack to fit through.  There were several areas where rebar was driven into the rock faces to make it possible to climb them. One such place required me to climb a rebar ladder and then slide along a narrow ledge to access a second ladder. I made it up the face, aware all the time that a friend of mine had his hike end at this spot a few days ago when he fell while attempting the transfer between ladders. He will be fine, but his injuries negate any chance to return to the trail this season. The flatter areas between climbs were complicated by boggy, muddy areas with some help provided by boardwalks. I had more than one of these either sink into the mire when I stepped on it. A few others would tip steeply up at the other end like a teeter totter. There were places where my trekking poles sank into the mud for several feet, although I never stepped in anything deeper than a few inches past my ankles. The trail conditions were challenging, but the skies had cleared, and I had the advantage of beautiful weather. The views from the summits were breathtaking, as Maine has also started living up to her reputation as a gorgeous state. I've been told that the first twenty-five miles are incredibly difficult and challenging, and then conditions ease up. Tomorrow morning I encounter Mahoosuc Notch, which is known as the most difficult and/or fun mile on the entire AT. It will take several hours to make my way through a ""jumbled pit of boulders."" Tango, Gravity, and I are planning to hike through together. Immediately after the Notch, you climb up Mahoosuc Arm, which has its own reputation for difficulty. We'll have to get started tomorrow and take the time needed to get through these obstacles. Tango and I reminded each other as we hiked into camp that we need to remember to find the fun in these rock climbing adventures we are having. It is quite cool this evening, and it took awhile for my feet to feel back to normal after getting them out of my wet, muddy shoes. I'm toasty right now and am going to wrap this up to make sure I'm adequately rested up for more challenges that Maine has to offer.","Gentian Pond Shelter Tent Site

Today was the day I was to hike through the much anticipated Mahoosuc Notch, famed as the AT's most difficult mile. Tengo Hombre, Gravity, and I hiked out together at 7:30 to finally experience the Notch.  My hope was to hike through the Notch and then climb Mahoosuc Arm, the very steep mountain just past the Notch. The approach to the Notch was far from easy, as we first hiked over Fulling Mill Mountain and then headed down to the Notch.  The descent was pretty steep and included another set of rebar ladders down a steep rock face. Climbing up such a ladder is straightforward, but climbing down one is a bit unnerving. There is really no way to turn around, so you descend the ladder by placing the ball of your foot on the rebar and wedging your heel against the rock as you walk down the rock face.  It's something I doubt I will ever get used to. To add to the excitement, one of the rungs on today's ladder was bent in at the middle.  I have no idea what force hit that step to bend it inward, but it added an extra few difficulty points. We arrived at the Notch and proceeded into its boulder field, from which we would not depart for 1.1 miles. For fun, I started the timer on my watch. I don't know what the record for completing the Notch is, but I had the same attitude I take toward running marathons. Completion is the goal. As Becky likes to say, ""We're completers not competers."" There was no worry that I would break any speed record, because it took me three hours and twenty-one minutes to make my way through that 1.1 miles. The trail led through a jumbled maze of huge boulders that had to be climbed over, squeezed through, and crawled under. White blazes and helpful white arrows led you on, but there were many places where you needed to puzzle out which way to go. Many places had multiple routes that could work. Several times I started one way, only to double back when I reached a point I couldn't figure out how to continue past. The route includes numerous tunnels, which require you to remove your pack and either push it ahead of you or pull it behind you. Many hikers stow their trekking poles, but since my balance isn't always the best, I kept mine with me. There were many places where a dropped pole would be gone forever as it fell between huge boulders, but I managed to hang on to both of mine. Numerous times I carefully tossed them in front of me, crawled, climbed, and pulled myself past the present obstacle, and then retrieved my poles. It was extremely strenuous, focused work, and I can't say I was sad to see it end with my only casualties being a torn off rear pocket from my pants and bloody knees. The scrapes on my knees are all superficial, so no harm done. Also, I had the forethought to take my wallet out of that very pocket this morning and stow it in my pack.  I did have one scary moment when I was working my way along what I thought was a solid ridge between two boulders. There was a spot that had a growth of roots and leaves over it, and when I stepped there, my left leg fell down into a hole over ten feet deep. Fortunately, I grabbed the side of a boulder and was eventually able to get my leg back out of the hole, again with no harm done.  I can't exactly say that making my way through the Notch was fun, but I enjoyed the challenge and remembered to be grateful that I had beautiful weather. Hiking the Notch in the rain would add another layer of excitement. I plan on posting several photos I took in the Notch. There is a campground immediately past the Notch, and I arrived there about 1:30. My initial thought was to decide I'd had enough excitement for one day, but after eating lunch and resting, I felt ready to go on. Tengo Hambre and Gravity were also in agreement, so we hiked up the very steep and challenging mountain named Mahoosuc Arm to close out our day. The 1.5 mile ascent was perhaps the steepest I have encountered yet, with all of the attributes of using roots and trees, scrambling over boulders, and climbing on hands and feet (and sometimes hands and knees). I told Tengo that I felt like I was reverting to an earlier life form, because I would sometimes continue my hands and feet crawling past the point I needed to. The ascent took a bit over two hours, and I was rewarded with some beautiful views near the summit. Also, the boggy, muddy slog that often accompanies ridge walks was much less pronounced today, and for the first time in several days I arrived at camp without my shoes, socks, and feet being soaked with muddy water.  The mile long descent into Speck Pond Shelter and Campground was also much less steep and difficult than usual, and I made it into camp at 6:15. I practiced my new skill of pitching my tent on a wooden platform, as there was no flat, rock-free ground to be found. Gravity arrived soon after I did. The three of us were quite pleased to have Mahoosuc Arm behind us. I only covered 5.1 miles today, but considering that I successfully navigated two of southern Maine's leading attractions, I feel very pleased with my progress today. There are still several more very challenging mountains to climb in the next week or so, and like Tengo and I discussed while in the Notch today, the best approach is simply to take things one step at a time. The white blazes frequently are painted high atop boulders, or point into seemingly impossible situations or tiny holes, but they do ultimately wind up on the summit of Mount Katahdin if you keep following them.","Full Goose Shelter and Campsite

Today dawned as another beautiful, sunny day, perfect for hiking. I was on the trail a bit before 8:00 with Tengo Hambre and Gravity. Our first objective was Old Speck Mountain, reached by a very steep, but short amount of trail. Tengo and I were talking and failed to notice that the AT takes a sharp left turn and begins to descend Old Speck about 0.3 miles from the summit. We should have known, because the side trail to the summit was surprisingly easy. We were distracted by a small flock of mountain grouse we encountered on the trail. They were not impressed with our presence and continued to move slowly up the trail in front of us.  It looked all the world like Tengo was herding them.  One left the trail and kept a sharp eye on me, posing for several photos as I passed by.  There is a wonderful observation tower on the summit of Old Speck, and the views were magnificent.  The observation platform is reached by climbing a ladder to a latched door. There are dual poles at the top of the ladder to hold onto as you complete your climb. Either it is well designed or I'm getting more used to heights, as I experienced almost zero anxiety climbing and entering the observation platform. I was told you can see Mounts Washington and Madison from the tower, and I took numerous photos. Back on the ground, I noticed the quarter moon in the sky above the tower and made sure to include her in my photo.  It was only then, while searching for the trail, that I realized that Tengo and I were actually 0.3 miles off the AT.  We both agreed that the grouse and the tower were both well worth a side trip from the main show. We hiked back to the intersection, made the sharp turn back onto the AT, and began the three mile descent to Grafton Notch. The descent was surprisingly not difficult, and we made good time through the woods. About half way down, the trail went across an open area over a huge, flat, rock face, and a beautiful vista opened to our left. The scene came across us unexpectedly and was just beautiful. Snatches of red in the distant forest offered another hint that the seasons are changing, as did the few patches where red and yellow leaves already lay upon the trail where they have already fallen.  We soon arrived at the road at Grafton Notch and decided to eat lunch. I asked a southbound hiker if she had seen Gravity and learned that he was indeed ahead of us. After eating lunch and disposing of all our trash in the waste can, Tengo and I began the climb up Baldpate Mountain. I paused at the huge AT sign at the intersection of the road and the trail to have my photo taken.  Many hikers hang on the sign in various acrobatic poses, but I was content to simply stand by it. I could only imagine the future conversation: ""Stick, how come your hike ended early?""  I would have to reply, ""I broke my leg falling off an AT sign.""  Not happening.  The beginning 2.3 miles up Baldpate were very easy, and we soon found ourselves at the Baldpate Lean-to. Maine chooses to call her shelters, ""lean-tos,"" although they are exactly the same as a shelter.  ""A rose by any other name . . . ""  We met up with Gravity shortly before the shelter, and he was greatly surprised to find us behind him.  In fact, he had chosen to eat lunch on the other side of the road at Grafton Notch, and heard us talking. He did not investigate because he believed we had to be in front of him.  He told us he asked a southbounder if he had seen two older hikers and was told that we were forty minutes ahead of him.  I guess there are several pairs of old hikers out on the AT.  We arrived at Baldpate Lean-to at 3:15 and were faced with a bit of a dilemma. The weather was absolutely perfect to continue hiking, and the next possible camping site, Frye Notch Lean-to, was only 3.5 miles away. However, the dual peaks of Baldpate Mountain lie between, and they are both reportedly very steep with numerous tall and steeply-inclined rock faces to both ascend and descend. Apparently, our relatively easy ascent of Baldpate was over. We did the math. We had 3.5 miles of challenging trail and four more hours of daylight. The decision was actually an easy one, and we stayed put. It will make tomorrow's trek to East B Hill Road, and then into Andover for resupply, much more lengthy, but that can't be helped. I spent a leisurely rest of my afternoon setting up camp, obtaining water from the rushing little brook behind the lean-to, and preparing dinner. We are all nearly out of food, so we must push on to Andover tomorrow, but at least we know we won't be trying to navigate the Baldpate peaks in the dark. Hopefully, we'll have some more of this perfect hiking weather as we continue to make our way through southern Maine's challenging, albeit beautiful, terrain.","Speck Pond Shelter and Campsite

The wind was blowing in the trees when I woke up this morning but subsided soon after.  Tengo Hambre, Gravity, and I left camp at 7:30 with the need to cross both the west and east peaks of Baldpate Mountain and make it to East B Hill Road in time to make it to Andover for resupply. It took us an extra day to get past Mahoosuc Notch and Arm, and we were all critically low on food.  I arrived at the road today with two mayonnaise packers and three Werther candies in my food bag.  I enjoyed the hike up Baldpate. It was relatively steep but there were few major obstacles to our progress.  We arrived on the west peak sooner than I expected, and I was blown away by the views (which is far better than literally being blown away by the wind). Of all the views I have enjoyed along the trail, I'm not sure if any are as amazing as what I am seeing in Maine. The trail between the peaks began with a short descent of west peak and then a slog through an alpine bog. There were boardwalks over most of it, but a few places were unattended.  One place required stepping on a series of rocks and then balancing along a mostly submerged log to a drier section of trail. I tested the bog with one of my trekking poles, and it sank down for nearly three feet without finding bottom. I heard that a hiker fell into the bog and sank up to her waist. Fortunately, I avoided any such mishap.  The trek up the east peak could only be accomplished by quickly walking directly up the rock faces aiming for the next cairn that marked the trail. It became obvious why hiking Baldpate in the rain is discouraged. The views, again, were incredible. I was able to see the range of mountains we had just crossed, and I could even make out the observation tower on Old Speck.  Things got interesting on the descent. The rock faces were extremely steep and very slick, particularly near the beginning of the descent.  I attempted to walk along the edge but started to slip. I ended up sitting down and sliding about forty feet, controlling my descent with my poles and by grabbing onto roots along the way. The descent was one of the most challenging I have experienced, but I eventually arrived at Frye Notch Lean-to at 11:20.  It was fortunate we hadn't tried this last night, as we would have ended up hiking in the dark. I ate a quick lunch before heading back on the trail.  The shuttle to the Human Nature Hostel in Andover was scheduled at 3:00, and there was 4.5 miles to cover. I had been told that the trail was reasonable over this stretch. This turned out to be true, and I hiked through beautiful forest scenery along what would be considered actual trail.  There were difficult sections, but overall the trail went well.  I arrived at the road by 2:40.  The shuttle bus was right on time. We first went to a general store in Andover that was also a cafe. I ate a hiker burger with homemade chips. We then came to the hostel, which is shaped like a geodesic dome. It is owned by Yukon, who thru-hiked in 2014. He is a certified survival instructor and has appeared twice on the show, Naked and Afraid.  The hostel is in the process of being completed, and is a unique, fascinating structure. After showering and getting my laundry prepared, I took the shuttle to Wal-Mart for resupply.  The shuttle was late, which allowed me to see an incredible sunset.  I returned to the hostel and sorted my food.  I then completed my journal and went to bed. There is a pancake breakfast at 7:00 and then I'm back on the trail. My pack will be much heavier as I now head for Rangely, but at least I'll have more food options than mayonnaise.","Baldpate Lean-to (Shelter)

I was up at 6:00 and was pretty much packed and ready at seven when Yukon announced that it was time for all-you-can-eat blueberry pancakes. The pancakes were huge, and I was feeling full after only two of them.  Kimchi gave me my copy of my hiker card, and she put her copy in their book. The card is a wonderful keepsake.  Several of the hikers who stayed at the hostel last night opted to zero and spend another day, but I was ready to push on. Yukon gave Tengo, Gravity, and I a ride back to the trailhead. A special thanks once again to Yukon, Kimchi, and Eywa for making my stay at their hostel so wonderful. We were back on the trail by 9:45. The trail went up and over Wyman and Hall Mountains. I passed Surplus Pond a few miles in, and for being surplus, it is certainly a beauty. I again wondered how some natural features acquired their names. The forest was again a delight to see, and I also saw numerous red squirrels and chipmunks.  The trail was somewhat steep and rugged, but was again more hiking trail than mountaineering. While there was no view at the top of Hall, I did find one nice outcropping on the way up, for my only distance view of the day. I had a mishap with one of my trekking poles today.  As I approached Hall Mountain Lean-to,  my right trekking pole punched through some very soft dirt alongside a rock. The end of the pole slid almost a foot into the hole, causing me to trip over it. I landed behind over appetite, with my head several feet lower than my shoes. Fortunately, it was in soft vegetation alongside the trail. I was unharmed, although I searched for nearly five minutes before finally finding my hat. My pole was not so lucky. It broke in two about ten inches from the end.  For the time being, I stowed the end in my pack and extended the middle section as long as I could, and continued on with one pole six inches shorter than the other and with a sharp, aluminum tube for a tip. I continually switched poles so the longer, undamaged one was on the side of the trail with the drop-off. The descent of Hall Mountain was steep but, again, not too terribly difficult, and my broken pole was merely an inconvenience. I arrived at Sawyer Brook at 3:45, completing my descent of Hall Mountain. There is a very nice campground by the brook, with several flat tent sites and a picnic table.  Tengo was already there when I arrived, and Gravity showed up by 4:00. We were faced with the same dilemma of a few days ago. We still had three hours of daylight on a beautiful day to hike. This time, we looked at Moody Mountain, which is one of the steepest climbs on the entire AT.  In 0.8 hiking miles, Moody goes up 1,367 feet. There are numerous rebar ladders to climb. After reaching the summit, there is a 1.8 mile descent to the next possible camping area. We decided to set up camp early and tackle Mount Moody first thing tomorrow. I was able to see her peak rising just to the north, offering a silent reminder that I'll have my work cut out for me tomorrow morning.  Immediately after descending Mount Moody, the trail goes up and over Old Blue Mountain, which is also steep, although nothing as extreme as Moody.  Bemis Mountain follows, and then there is a lean-to and camping area just past her peak. Our ambitious goal is to make it to there by tomorrow evening, a distance of 11.3 miles.  We all enjoyed a leisurely, restful evening, setting up camp, obtaining water, and cooking dinner. I was able to use a rock to round out the broken end of my trekking pole, and insert it into the adjusting collar. I made sure there was sufficient metal inside the tube so the pole won't be weak at the joint. By the time I was done, my damaged pole again sports its carbide tip and is only three inches shorter than its sibling. I'm thinking it should get me to Katahdin. Darkness came on a bit after 7:00 and, with it, an early hiker's midnight.  The weather should be clear again tomorrow, and has actually been quite warm lately. We plan on an early start tomorrow to give us as much daylight as possible to hike our mountains.","East B Hill Road (Andover, ME)

Today's plan was for an ambitious 11.3 mile hike to the lean-to past Bemis Mountain. This required hiking up and over Moody Mountain and Old Blue Mountain, as well as Bemis Mountain. The weather, as it has been since I entered Maine, was perfect for hiking, with beautiful clouds and sunny skies. (I'm knocking on wood as I write this). The route up Moody, as predicted, was incredibly steep. While very strenuous, there were few places that were difficult to navigate. The descent to South Arm Road also held few surprises. It took a little over two hours to complete the route up and over Moody, so it would have been possible to have done it yesterday afternoon. Still, I'm glad we waited and took it on while fresh and rested. The summit was covered with trees, but I did pass an overlook with a view on the way down the mountain.  Next up was Old Blue, the ascent of which was 2.8 miles long. It was not quite as steep as Moody, but still formidable. As with Moody, however, there were few areas that presented technical difficulties, and I steadily worked my way up the mountain, arriving at the summit around 12:30.  Although the summit was reported to have a view, I ate my lunch atop the mountain surrounded by short fir trees. It was a very pretty spot, but without a view. Like with Moody, however, I did pass a nice view on the way down. I was feeling very good about the day and anticipated an early arrival at the lean-to. All that was left was 5.9 more miles with little elevation change. The route up ""little"" Bemis Mountain was only a rise of 200 feet in one mile. I suppose if I haven't learned not to underestimate the AT during the 1,950 miles I hiked to get to the top of Bemis Mountain, I'm not going to get it figured out in the last 239.8 miles to Katahdin. Perhaps Bemis took issue with being taken for granted, as both the ascent and descent, while short in mileage and elevation change, made up for it with technically difficult trail obstacles. From mostly hiking along rocky and rooty trail as I had the rest of the day, I was reintroduced to bouldery trail and steep, wet, slick rock faces, particularly on the descent, where they are the most problematic. For years I have used the saying, ""It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog."" Bemis had plenty of ""fight,"" and it was after 6:30 when this weary hiker finally arrived at the campsite. I did remind myself to remain mindful of the beauty through which I was hiking, at least during those places where all attention was on not slipping and falling down a slick rock face. Like its larger sisters, Bemis was tree covered on her summit but offered a beautiful view on the way down. After arriving at the campsite, I quickly set about pitching my tent, throwing my bear line, and going to get water. Gravity arrived shortly after I did and went with me for water. Tengo arrived a bit before I did and opted to sleep in the shelter. As it turned out, it was completely dark by the time I got back to my tent. I cooked dinner by the light of my headlamp, hung my food bag, and was in my tent by 8:30. I hope for another big day tomorrow, covering 12.9 miles to a campsite only 4.8 miles to ME 4, the road to Rangeley and my next resupply. The topo lines from the guidebook look conducive. There is another lean-to 8.3 miles from here, however, in case southern Maine again wants to remind me of what she is capable of presenting along with all of her beauty. I'm resting now and can feel my legs rejuvenating for another day as the aches subside. I'm sure I'll be ready for whatever tomorrow holds, as I continue to make my way through beautiful, but challenging, Maine.","Sawyer Brook Campsite

The day dawned cloudy with a pre-rain feeling. The goal for today was to at least make it to the Sabbath Day Pond (here we go again with the how-places-get-their-name game) Lean-to, and hopefully push on to the Little Swift River Pond Campsite. The terrain looked promising, but I remembered the surprises that Bemis Mountain threw at me yesterday. The trail to Bemis Mountain Second Peak was relatively flat and consisted of a primarily dirt trail with lots of rocks and roots added in for spice. It was very hikable. Nearing the summit, there was lots of walking on rock faces but, again, the going was pretty easy. For the first time in days I hiked over a summit that was in the clouds. There is an eery beauty in the mist. It wouldn't be long before the fog was gone, and the day returned to the sunny, warm weather I have been enjoying.  The descent of Bemis the Second provided the only real challenge of the day, with patches of very slick, steeply slanted rock faces. These didn't last long, however, and the trail for the rest of the day lacked the precarious nature of which I have grown accustomed. Beside the road at the bottom of the descent, I encountered a happy surprise. Trail Magic! Some kind soul left a large cooler with drinks and goodies. I scored a can of Ginger Ale and a blue snowball. They were yummy. Just past the road was Bemis Stream, which includes a note in the guidebook that it would need to be forded. Unlike all the other states, Maine apparently feels no strong need to build footbridges over its larger waterways. Hikers were securing their phones and preparing their clothing at the road. I decided to wait and see what the stream looked like. Perhaps the state is in a drought, because Bemis Stream was easily crossed by stepping from rock to rock across its width, just like countless other streams I have crossed for the past five plus months. That's not to say there won't be future streams that will present greater challenges. After crossing the stream, the trail went up the only major incline of the day. Near the top, it crossed ME 17, and I was greeted with a tremendous view of a large lake with surrounding forest and distant mountains. There was even a bench, and a young hiker asked if I wanted to join him. Unfortunately, if you're going to hike slow you have to hike long, so I only lingered a few minutes before continuing on to Sabbath Day Pond and its Lean-to. The pond is huge and presented yet another gorgeous view. I met Tengo at the lean-to and we ate lunch. It was 2:30 when we finished, and we opted to continue on to the campsite, another 4.6 miles further on. After leaving a note for Gravity, we pushed on. The terrain was similar to this morning, and I enjoyed a very pleasant afternoon hike. Walking through Maine is a delight, albeit a very challenging delight at times. Today, southern Maine showed her kinder, gentler side, and I spent the majority of my day enjoying a true walk in the woods. I arrived at Little Swift River Pond at 5:45 and had plenty of time to set up camp and do my evening chores before dark.  Little Swift River Pond is another absolutely stunning sight. There was an old canoe on the bank, and Tengo borrowed a fishing pole from a young hiker who had pulled it out of a hiker box, and went fishing.  He invited her to go with him, but she said she was cooking dinner. Tengo contends that no activity should take precedence over fishing. Murph, my friend from home, would readily agree. I watched him from the bank as I collected water from the spring by the lake and was pleased that I didn't have to filter pond water. It was almost dusk when I saw one of the best sights I have seen this trip. A moose entered the pond and stood complacently for observation and photos from a safe distance. I hoped to see a moose in Maine, and my wish has been granted. I tried to use the zoom on my camera, with limited success. I suppose I could have paddled out in the canoe and gotten close enough to use my flash, but probably wisely decided against it.  After watching this huge, magnificent creature for a spell, I returned to more mundane activities like cooking dinner. Gravity soon arrived and set up camp near me. Thanks to our afternoon push, there is only a 4.8 mile hike in the morning to ME 4 and then into Rangeley for resupply.  By getting there early, I have an extra lunch in my food bag, so I am a bit better provisioned than I was getting into Andover. The plan is to stay tomorrow night in a hostel and then hit the trail the morning after, ready to take on the next big challenge Maine has to offer: Saddleback Mountain. I received a text from Dutch today. I hiked into Hot Springs with Dutch all that time ago and saw him again at Harpers Ferry. We've kept in touch since then. He wanted to let me know that he was summitting Katahdin today.  Congratulations, Dutch!  Another of my friends has completed their trek, and I'm excited to think that my time is coming soon. First, of course, is Saddleback Mountain. One step at a time/one white blaze at a time.","Bemis Mountain Lean-to/Campsite

Even though we only had 4.8 miles to travel today, I got up at my regular time. I could tell by the orange glow against my tent wall that the sun was getting ready to rise on the lake, and I made sure I was out and about when it did. I was not disappointed. The sun rose directly across the lake from my tent site and was stunning. I finished packing up and was ready to hike by 7:30.  The trail remained relatively easy, and I made good time all the way to the road. There was one very nice view from an unnamed spot. Otherwise I walked in a pretty green corridor. There was one area of very impressive trail work, where a long, winding shelf had been constructed of rock to carry the trail above a muddy bog. Usually in such instances, the best you can hope for is a patchwork of wooden planks, oftentimes with some of them broken and/or sunk in the mire.  More often than not, you hope for rocks and logs to hop along so as to not sink into the soft, sticky mud.  The work that went into the rock shelf I hiked over today was impressive, and I was most appreciative of the unknown crew that constructed it. I called the Farmhouse Inn Hostel while a mile from the road, as there was no reception in the valley through which the road travelled. This is very common along the trail.  The shuttle was waiting when I got there (I told the woman at the hostel that I was old and slow). There was no problem, however, since the driver was an avid fisherman, and he and Tengo were busy talking shop. Gravity arrived a few minutes after I did, and we were soon at the Farmhouse Inn Hostel.  The hostel is truly a very impressive farmhouse on a beautiful piece of land. Gravity, Tengo, and I spent a few extra dollars apiece for a single room with three beds. We started our laundry and caught the 1:00 shuttle into Rangeley.  Gravity, Tengo, and I joined several other thru hikers for lunch at Sarge's Sports Pub and Grub. I had the Hiker Burger with fries. Our table of hikers was surrounded by a horde of avid Patriots fans, as the game was on every television in the place. New Englanders do love their Patriots. After lunch, we resupplied at the local IGA and went to an outfitters called Ecopelagicon. I got my trekking pole fixed for free, replaced my z-seat which blew away on Mount Madison, and purchased a new water filter. My original filter, which I have used since Springer, was getting slow even after backflushing. Rangeley is a beautiful little town with many shops.  Both the town, the nearby lake, and the Farmhouse Inn all make you want to come back for a future vacation. Next time, however, I'll bring Sandy, and we'll bring a car.  Back at the hostel, I spent a leisurely evening sorting my resupply and cleaning equipment.  I heard that Frodo, Samwise, and Gimli had arrived, so I stopped by their room to visit. I also received a text from my good buddy, Juan Gone, who just summitted Katahdin. Gravity, Tengo, and I plan to catch the 6:30 shuttle back to the trailhead tomorrow to get an early start on Saddleback Mountain.  Our hope is to reach Poplar Ridge Lean-to, which is 10.7 miles away. There are three peaks, Saddleback Mountain, the Horn, and Saddleback Junior, between us, and the trail is reported to be challenging. Over two miles is above tree line, so I'm hoping there won't be too much wind. If need be, there is a campsite just past the Horn. I'm going back to sleep now to be ready for tomorrow. The forecast calls for yet another day of sunshine, so I hope to be treated to more of the intense beauty of Maine as I hike over three more of her mountains.","Little Swift River Pond Campsite

I was up by 5:15 this morning and was packed and ready to go in time for the 6;30 shuttle back to the trailhead.  Jet Pack, a past thru hiker who also enjoys hiking these mountains in the winter, gave us a ride. Believe me, I am finding the mountains of southern Maine plenty challenging enough without adding ice and snow.  A few miles into today's hike, before things got steep, I passed Plazza Rock Lean-to, which is famous on the AT for its two seater privy. A sign on the outside let's you know that it's ""Your Move,"" and a cribbage board resides between the privy seats. I don't know how many games have actually been played there, but it's fun to know that bowels aren't the only thing that moves in this privy. (Sorry). I also passed Ethel and Eddy Ponds before the trail got seriously into the climb up Saddleback Mountain and was, as always, taken back by their beauty.  I've encountered many such ponds since I've been in Maine, but the sight of these glacial ponds never grows old.  The hike up Saddleback was long, and the last mile or so was above tree line. Instead of scrambling over endless boulders like in the Whites, the final ascent of Saddleback was up open rock faces. While steeply graded, the rock was rough enough that it was usually possible to walk right up it. The way was well marked with white blazes and cairns. On one cliff face, a large AT logo with a corresponding arrow was painted boldly on the rock, letting me know that I at least didn't have to scale the sheer face of the cliff. Instead, a narrow ledge led to the next level. The views from Saddleback were absolutely stunning in all directions.  Looking north, it was possible to see much of the trail leading up to The Horn, my second mountain of the day.  There were a few tricky places on the descent of Saddleback before the trail again headed upward to The Horn, but nothing too terrible.  I met Tengo at the summit for lunch. We were soon joined by Jason, Maple, Boomer, and Single T.  Maple came right up to me with that special look and successfully Yogied a piece of my Spam Single from me.  (Yogi-ing is when a thru hiker manages to get a handout without specifically asking for one).  We enjoyed a leisurely lunch before deciding it was time to move on. The descent from The Horn was significantly tougher than from Saddleback, but I took my time and eventually arrived at Redington Campsite.  Although there was a 0.2 mile side trail to water, I didn't want to risk running out while traversing Saddleback Junior, so I left my pack by the trail and took my water equipment to a quiet little stream. I was immediately glad that I obtained a new filter and was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I was able to treat my water. Back on the trail, I hiked up Saddleback Junior, my third and last mountain for the day. There was quite a bit more rock scrambling than before, but I made pretty good time up the mountain.  Clouds and fog had moved in by then, and the summit was totally socked in.  The first 0.4 miles of the descent were the hardest of the day. As I slowly worked my way down the steep rock faces and jumbled boulders, I often resorted to sitting down and scooting. On the way down, I met Pip, a fellow thru hiker who left Springer Mountain on April 1st.  He decided to slow his pace for a spell,  and we had a nice chat as we negotiated our way down the mountainside.  I asked Pip if his name was from the Lord of the Rings or from Shakespeare. He replied that it's from his first name, Philip, minus the ""hill.""  I responded that we certainly hadn't been minus any hills lately, and he told me they weren't hills, they were mounrains. How true. Pip's beard is the same color mine used to be, and I explained I am a redhead in stealth mode. I was only headed to the next shelter while Pip had several more miles to go, so he moved on. It was a lot of fun getting to meet a new thru hiker, especially one who must have been hiking around me for months. The trail became much easier the last mile of the day. I knew I was near the shelter when I passed a privy beside the trail. It was a surprisingly long way from the shelter, so I will have a bit of a southbound hike in the morning. I arrived at the shelter at 5:20 and set up my tent on a nice, flat area near the lean-to. A pretty little stream flows right near my tent, so at least I didn't have to go far for water. Poplar Ridge Lean-to is infamous as being the place that Geraldine Largay (trail name, Inchworm), the hiker who perished when she left the trail and was unable to find it again, was last seen.  Such a tragic loss. There is a tribute to her in the lean-to. It started to feel like it might rain while I was cooking dinner and, sure enough, a light drizzle began to fall at sundown.  The rain continues as I write this,  and the forecast is for more tomorrow. I've had a very long run of incredibly good weather, so I have nothing to complain about. I will be hiking Spaulding and Sugarloaf Mountains tomorrow so, hopefully, the rain will remain light. As with all things, only time will tell. Either way, I need to be well-rested, so I'll end this and go back to sleep.","ME 4, Rangeley, ME/Farmhouse Inn Hostel

What little rain we had last night was long gone when I awoke this morning at my usual time.  I was on the trail by 7:30 with the somewhat ambitious goal of making it to the Carrabassett River, a bit over thirteen miles away. The final descent of the Saddlebacks provided a few challenging moments, particularly with the rock faces being wet from last night's rain.  There was far more reasonable trail today, and I made good time hiking through more of Maine's beautiful forests. The leaves continue to change color, which provides extra beauty, both up close and in the views of distant forests.  There weren't any views for most of the day, as the sky remained overcast.   The hike up Lone Mountain was uneventful, and then the trail followed a basically flat ridgeline for several miles to the Spaulding Mountain Lean-to. I ate my lunch there and got water at the spring. It was two o'clock, and there was 5.1 miles to go to the stealth site by the Carrabassett River.  Tengo and Gravity were both also there, and we decided to continue on.  I hiked up Spaulding Mountain in good time, and the trail again followed a ridgeline. I knew we would be descending down to the river, and I continued on as quickly as I safely could, banking on the fact that the AT couldn't remain this easy for too long.  Along the way I came across a bronze plaque that commemorated the completion of the last section of the AT from Georgia to Maine. It was on August 14, 1937 that this last section was completed, and the then 2,054 mile trail was complete. It wouldn't be until 1948 that Earl Shaffer would complete the first thru hike. Much of the trail was completed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, and it amazes me how hard these men must have worked carving out this trail. I paused a few moments by the plaque before continuing on. As the trail neared the river valley, a beautiful vista suddenly opened up, and the skies had cleared of fog.  An absolutely amazing scene appeared before me as I began hiking along the edge of the bluffs above the Carrabassett. The trail became very rocky and covered in a fine, gritty mixture of sand, dirt, and gravel that was extremely slick.  I asked aloud, to no one in particular, if someone could perhaps sweep the rocks before I walked on them. I also came across a single rock, a bit larger than my hand, that held special significance. Although I am still loving my time on the trail, I have now been away from home for over five months, so a rock shaped like Missouri obviously grabbed my attention. I decided my pack was heavy enough, so I was content with taking a photo.  I was absolutely correct in assuming the AT would get serious again as it descended into the valley. I encountered the most challenging boulder scrambles that I have seen in several days. Part of the challenge is often choosing the route to take, since there may be numerous routes. One such spot today really stood out. To the right was a more open route that required swinging out from one boulder to land on another below it. I opted to go to the left, which forced me to drop down a crevice between two boulders, hold my body up with my arms, push though a narrow crack, and then drop onto another boulder below. I had to toss my trekking poles onto a lower surface, and one of my water bottles was squeezed from its pouch, but I landed safely and retrieved my equipment. There were numerous other situations as I gradually worked my way down the mountain. The trail eventually leveled out, and the last half mile or so was still rocky with some boulders, but basically flat as it paralleled the river.  Again, Maine does not believe in footbridges, and when the water is up, the Carrabassett is not crossable where the AT meets it. Fortunately, the water is down, and I got across with little difficulty. The stealth campsite was just north of the river.  It's a very pretty, flat area just off the trail. Tengo and I arrived at 6:30 with still a half hour of daylight. Gravity arrived a bit later. We cooked dinner in the dark. A very light mist, which you could see in the light of your headlamp but not really feel, began at dusk. A very light rain started falling as we headed for our tents. The forecast calls for the rain to end tonight and then for several more days of sunshine to follow. There will be a very steep and rocky ascent of South Crocker Mountain and then her sister, North Crocker Mountain, tomorrow morning. The descent is reported to be more reasonable and leads all the way to ME 27, from where we plan on heading to Stratton for resupply. This little adventure of mine may be beginning to wind down, but there is still plenty of Maine to walk through before I reach Katahdin.","Poplar Ridge Lean-to

The rain stopped during the night, and I awoke to a damp, cool morning. I slept a bit later than usual. I broke camp and was on the trail by 7:45. The hike up South Crocker Mountain was uneventful. The cloudy weather precluded any chance of views, but the changing leaves only added more beauty to the forest itself.  The rocks and roots were all slick with the rain, so extra care was in order all day. I slipped several times but never fell.  The AT passes within fifty feet of the summit of South Crocker Mountain, but I saw no reason to hike to the summit since everything was clouded in anyway. The descent  of South and the subsequent ascent of North Crocker Mountain played out in a similar vein.  From North Crocker Mountain, the trail was a lengthy 5.2 mile descent to the road. I thoroughly enjoyed this last part of my day's journey, which was often somewhat steep but never really difficult.  About 1.6 miles from the road, I encountered the 2,000 mile mark. It's hard to believe I have covered 2,000 miles since I stood on Springer Mountain back in April. Tengo and I posed for photos. I set a bit of Beau free and hiked on.  I arrived at ME 27 around three o'clock. Here I met Sachin, who was waiting for his girlfriend, Hybrid, a northbound thru hiker. He was providing Trail Magic for all hikers, and I got an orange Fanta, a Reese's peanut butter cup, and a Twinkie. He hiked with Hybrid through the Whites, and we were able to swap stories.  Thanks, Sachin, for the conversation and the goodies, and good luck to Hybrid as she completes her thru hike. Tengo called for a shuttle, and we were soon at the Stratton Motel/Hostel, which is owned by the same folks who own the Farmhouse Inn Hostel in Rangeley. I got a room in the bunkhouse and was lucky to get a bottom bunk. There are three whimsical bear statues that greeted me at the hostel, so I added them to my list of non-wild bear sightings. At least I saw one bear on my trip, and I still have over 180 miles to see another. I ate lunch at the Stratton Plaza with Gravity and Tengo, and I also saw Boomer, Single T, Jason, and Maple. I resupplied at Fotter's market and got enough food for four days, although I hope to.make it to Caratunk, the next resupply point, in three. Gravity, Tengo, and I will catch the 7:30 shuttle back to the trailhead tomorrow and begin our traverse of the Bigelow Mountain Range. There are only two more resupply points, Caratunk and Monson, between me and Katahdin, a fact that is bringing home the reality that this little adventure of mine is actually drawing to a close. I've been told that the views from the Bigelow and Avery Mountains are some of the best on the AT. The forecast for tomorrow is for sunshine, so I look forward to finding out for myself.","Stealth Campsite by Carrabassett River

I woke up at five o'clock and enjoyed a quiet hour of lying in bed until my alarm went off at six.  The shuttle back to the trail head wasn't until 7:30, so I had plenty of time. I was ready to go by 7:15, but the shuttle was delayed, and we did not make it to the trail head until 8:15. The goal for today was 10.4 miles to Safford Notch Campsite via the Bigelow Mountain Range. I would be hiking over three peaks: South Horn, Bigelow Mountain west peak, and Avery Peak, which is named for Myron H. Avery, one of the main founders of the Appalachian Trail.  Many hikers contend that the views from these peaks are the most spectacular of the entire trail, and I was eager to find out. The first few miles were flat, and I made good time. I passed the official 2,000 mile marker, a wooden sign attached to a tree. As I've noted before, the length of the trail changes slightly periodically as minor reroutes are completed,  so the permanent signs are a bit off. It was near here that I met two southbounders who came across the Bigelows yesterday. They were disappointed that they had no views at all, since everything was in the clouds yesterday. I crossed the Crockers yesterday, which are mostly in tree cover with limited views. What a difference one day can make, as today was sunny and clear, as beautiful a day as could possibly be imagined.  The majority of the ascent to Horns Peak was steep but uneventful. The trail rises over 2,000 feet in two and a half miles. There,  it briefly levels out near Horns Pond. Another glacial pond, Horns Pond is nestled high on the mountain and makes for quite a view when it makes its appearance from the trail. A favorite fishing spot, there is an old CCC hut by the trail for day use only. I ate my lunch there with Tengo before getting down (or, rather, up) to the business of summitting South Horn Peak. The trail was wicked steep, and I felt like I was climbing rocky stairs up a lighthouse. About half way up the half mile ascent, there is a small box spring, where I stopped to get water. The spring is literally in a box with a wooden lid. I almost passed it by before realizing what it was. I removed the lid and scooped out some of the coldest, freshest water I have enjoyed on the trail. I drank a liter right there, filtering it directly into my mouth and actually had a mild brain freeze. Delicious!  If there is any water on the trail safe to drink, this would be it, but I don't want to take any chances of getting sick this close to the end. I then powered my way up the rest of the way to the peak at South Horn. The final bit was above tree line, narrow, and rocky. I purposefully focused on the trail all the way to the summit, although I could sense the vista that surrounded me. At the summit, I looked up. What a glorious sight! I can't begin to describe the views. There were ranges of mountains as far as you can see, forested areas with changing fall colors all around, and lakes in almost every direction. The view is all around and is as beautiful a sight as I can imagine.  What a blessing to be able to experience it on such an idyllic day. To the north was Bigelow Mountain west peak, 1.1 miles away. The hike between these peaks went well, with the final ascent not quite as steep as the first.  The views were as spectacular as before. Avery Peak was next. From west peak, you could see part of the trail making its way to the top. The last part of the ascent to Avery involved climbing over jumbled boulders while also going steeply up, which presented a bit of a challenge.  Once again, the views were superb. A bronze plaque, commemorating Myron Avery and his achievements, is mounted on a boulder near the summit.  By this time it was 2:30, and there was still two miles to go to the campsite. Most of the descent was steep but unremarkable, and I remained optimistic that I would make it easily by dark. There I go, underestimating the AT again. The final section before the campsite worked its way around boulders the size of houses (no exaggeration). It was getting late, but I forced myself to take my time. A weary hiker on rugged trail trying to hurry to beat the dark is a recipe almost guaranteed to not end well. Although I was unaware of it at the time, I was within a hundred yards of the side trail to the campsite when I heard something loudly crashing its way through the forest.  Perhaps fifty yards from me and headed in my general direction was a huge bull moose.  This was quite a different situation than a female moose calmly feeding in a pond a safe distance away. I immediately moved to put one of those huge boulders between me and the moose, and I doubt he was ever aware of my existence. He soon moved on, although in the same direction as the campsite. I waited several minutes and then cautiously continued on. The 0.2 mile trail to the campsite was not without its challenges as well, including having to duck under this huge, slanting boulder that was almost like a cave. I finally arrived at 6:30. I was able to locate a small tent spot, get my tent set up, and throw my bear rope before darkness descended. It is now getting to be completely dark by 7:00.  I stayed near my tent to cook dinner. I was concerned that if I left the immediate area of my tent, I might not be able to find it again as there really isn't a trail to it. I finished dinner, relocated my bear line to hang my food, and was in my tent by 8:30. There will be a long ridge crossing tomorrow along Little Bigelow Mountain before things level out a bit as I head into central Maine. The goal tomorrow is West Carry Pond, which is 12.6 miles to the north.  It's a calm, cool night, with the forecast calling for yet another beautiful day. I think about those two hikers this morning who, by the luck of the draw, missed out on seeing the panoramas that I was blessed to see crossing the Bigelows. It is said that the hike hikes you more than you hike the hike, and I believe this to be true. Back to sleep now for tomorrow will be another big day.","ME 27/Stratton Motel/Hostel

I slept until 6:00 this morning, and it was 7:45 before I was ready to hit the trail.  The campsite is really quite impressive with tent sites constructed by building up one side of an area with rocks to create a level spot large enough for a tent. A good deal of effort went into each pad's creation. I hiked back out the side trail and took a photo of the cave/tunnel on the way back to the AT.  I was headed north again by 8:00.  The first order of business was to hike up Little Bigelow Mountain, the last of the Bigelows. The climb was straightforward, again in perfect hiking weather.  There was a view as I reached the ridgeline, which stretches on for over a mile. The summit itself is tree covered with no view.  I then began the long descent down to Flagstaff Lake. I ate lunch along its shore, and Flagstaff Lake looks as impressive close up as it does from atop the Bigelows.  A single pair of birds swam in front of me. Unfortunately, I'm not too good with  bird types, but I was told they were mergancers. I have good friends at home that will help me make a positive identification.  The trail all afternoon qualified as regular trail, albeit with lots of rocks and roots to add some spice.  It felt almost strange to just be hiking again and not ascending and descending steep mountainous trails. I came across yet another 2,000 mile marker, and someone had painted ""2,000 miles"" across Long Falls Dam Road. A proofreader with a spray can corrected the error by crossing out the errant number and replacing it with the correct mileage: 2,021.1. Three and a half miles later, I hiked into the West Carry Pond Lean-to area. It was only 5:15, which made for a much more leisurely evening in camp. I walked down to West Carry Pond to get water and sat on the bank for awhile enjoying the view. Another pair of birds, identical in appearance to the ones at Flagstaff Lake, swam together in the lake.  I am presently 13.6 miles from the Kennebec River, which presents a bit of a dilema. Fording the Kennebec is strongly discouraged, and the ATC and the MATC provide a free ferry service via canoe across the river. Unfortunately, the ferry service only runs until 2:00. If Gravity, Tengo, and I can get to the river before then, we will be able to cross and get to Caratunk tomorrow. If not, we'll need to wait until the next day. Our plan is to all hike to Pierce Pond Lean-to tomorrow, which is 4.2 miles to the river and reassess our chances then. The terrain is conducive, as the entire route is basically flat with a slight descending tilt towards the river. We're planning on getting an early start, but not pushing to the point of stressing about it. I'm sure there will be plenty of roots and rocks to hike over, around, and on, so we'll still need to be careful. Either way, the canoe ferry is another fun part of the AT experience, and I'm really looking forward to it. Right before waking up to write this, I had a nightmare that I was being forced to hike at night while writing my journal at the same time. Believe me, trying to hike by the light of a cell phone is no easy task. It's still very early for me to be writing this (10:30), and I'm looking forward to going back to sleep while listening to the calls of loons and the howling of coyotes.  Another wonderful day in Maine draws to a close.","Safford Notch Campsite

It's never fun to hike with a deadline, but there was one today. I was up at 5:00 and did my morning chores by headlamp. I was on the trail by 6:30. We had 13.7 miles to cover to get to the Kennebeck River, and the canoe ferry stops operating at 2:00.  Southbounders told me the trail was pretty reasonable, so we were optimistic about our chances. The first ten miles went well, and we made good time. The forest was beautiful, and we passed several large ponds.  At East Carry Pond the sun was shining so brilliantly that it was difficult to look at the water. I took a chance and took a photograph, which turned out very well.  We arrived at Pierce Pond Lean-to at 11:30, leaving us two-and-a-half hours to cover 3.6 miles.  You will probably guess that the trail became much more difficult at this point and you would, of course, be correct. The trail followed alongside Pierce Pond Stream and became steep, rocky, and rooty. The stream was spectacular and included several waterfalls. Unfortunately,  I was unable to give it the attention I would have liked, due to the upcoming deadline.  I was still able to stop briefly on several occasions to admire its beauty.  I was still optimistic we would make it, but doubts grew. I had a slight misadventure while crossing a foot bridge that consisted of one log to walk across while holding on to two other logs that ran parallel and a few feet above the other log. I had already become complacent about cinching the cord that holds my main water bottle, and when I leaned down to get positioned to climb onto the bridge, my bottle fell out, slid down a boulder, and came to rest in a crevice about five feet below the bridge. I was able to scramble down and retrieve it without too much difficulty.  The trail eventually improved, and we made it to the Kennebeck at 1:15. I could see the canoe on the other side of the river. Soon, Craig the ferryman, paddled across to ferry us across the river. The ferry service is another classic AT experience, and there is even a white blaze painted in the bottom of the canoe.  Craig, who completed a northbound thru hike in 2005 has been helping ferry hikers across since 2003. I signed a waiver, put on a life jacket, and manned the front paddle as we crossed the river. Shortly after we crossed, the river began to rise rapidly due to a release of water at a dam upstream. The river rose several feet in a few minutes and became very swift. There is good reason why fording the Kennebeck is so strongly discouraged. After helping Craig carry the canoe up the bank, Tengo, Gravity, and I headed for the Caratunk House B&B Hostel.  Housed in a building built in the 1880s, the hostel is a beautiful building with real charm. It is a great place to stay, and the milk shakes are first rate (I had two). Tengo and I shared a room for $20 a person. A great deal anywhere.  The owner, Paul, aka One Braid, thru hiked the AT in 1990 and in 1992. He also thru hiked the PCT in 1994 and did a two-year split trip in 2004-2005. A political activist for civil rights, Paul received an official citation from the legislature in Maine for a 395 mile walk he made across Maine in the winter of 1998, encouraging citizens to vote against repealing the state's new law guaranteeing rights for its gay citizens. Paul is a wonderful, thoughtful, and compassionate man, and we enjoyed a long conversation this evening.  I purchased my resupply items for the upcoming three day hike to Monson from his well-stocked store. He then shuttled Gravity, Tengo, Indiana Jane, and me to the Kennebec River Brewery, where we enjoyed dinner and a pint.  Breakfast is at 7:00, and then we will hit the trail for Monson, which will be my last resupply point before reaching Mount Katahdin. I've looked over the last section of my guidebook,  and an October 5th summit date looks likely, which will be exactly six months since I left home. I'm enjoying the spectacular scenery of Maine and the warm friendship of her citizens as I prepare for this little adventure of mine to draw to a close.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

Paul told me last night that breakfast would be served at 7:00, which worked well for getting a relatively early start on the hike in the morning. We were treated to one of the finest breakfasts I can ever remember having. Indiana Jane, Tengo, Gravity, Whiskers, Dr. GoMo, and I were served scrambled eggs with mushrooms, fried potatoes, french toast, bacon, fresh fruit, orange juice, and coffee.  We had a wonderful time chatting while we ate. Paul truly outdid himself, and I so much enjoyed my stay at his hostel. Thanks ever so much, Paul, for your hospitality! Gravity, Tengo, and I were on the trail by 8:30 with the goal of reaching Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to, which was 14.7 miles away. We had Pleasant Pond Mountain to climb up and over, our only mountain for the day. The trail was reasonable all day, with lots of roots and rocks but few real obstacles. The ascent of Pleasant Pond Mountain was made a bit more complicated by the heat. I have discussed my concern about winter coming, but there was no hint of that today. I believe the temperature may have reached the eighties, although I didn't bother to check my thermometer. I stopped for lunch just prior to the climb, even though it was still early. I also got water from a stream and drank a liter right then.  This was a good idea, because I was down to a half liter and feeling thirsty when I reached the next water source, which was 5.1 miles past the summit of the mountain.  The skies were again bright and sunny, and I enjoyed a nice view from Pleasant Pond Mountain. I passed two streams on the way down with very little water and was glad to get to Baker Stream which is a pretty major stream.  While the water was obviously low, there was a good flow.  From there, it was an easy 2.6 mile hike to Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to. I arrived at 5:45, feeling pretty much worn out, which I largely attribute to the heat. The water was quite low in the brook, but there was a slight flow, and I was able to use my scoop to obtain water. I took care of my evening chores and visited with Tengo, Gravity, Indiana Jane, and two southbounders whose names I didn't get, while I cooked dinner. I was in my tent before eight. I'm looking to get an early start tomorrow.  I'm planning on thirteen miles which includes Moxie Bald Mountain, the last mountain before Monson.  I would like to have as much remaining daylight as possible when I arrive in camp, so I'm hoping for a 6:30 departure time in the morning.  Today was a good day, and it's starting to come to me how close I am getting to the end. I should reach Monson the day after tomorrow, which will be my last resupply as I then enter the Hundred Mile Wilderness on my home stretch to Katahdin.","US 201, Caratunk, ME/Caratunk House B&B Hostel

With the days continuing to shorten, getting up at 5:00, breaking camp in the dark, and hiking out at daybreak has become the new norm.  It also promised to be another very warm day, so I wanted to hike in the cool of the morning as long as possible. It became warm very early, and the heat and humidity actually reminded me of home.  Hiking up Moxie Bald Mountain was the first object of the day. Moxie Bald is the last mountain before Monson. It was a steep, but fun, climb, and I soon found myself nearing the summit. There was a marvelous view from near the top. I never lose the feeling of awe that comes over me when I get to the point where such views open up to me. I'm not good enough with words to adequately describe these scenes, and photos can only show so much. The sheer vastness of the vistas are simply overwhelming.  Approaching the treeless summit, I hiked directly into the sun, which made it difficult to see the trail ahead of me. I caught a silhouette of Tengo hiking ahead of me and took a quick photo. I soon reached the top and rested there awhile, enjoying the views. What goes up, must come down, so I then descended the mountain and arrived at Bald Mountain Pond. I paused there to take in that view as well, and to obtain water, since I was drinking a lot in the heat.  A little frog swam up to see what I was doing and kindly posed for a photo   before swimming away to do what frogs do on beautiful warm days in Maine. The trail flattened out after that, although there were many short sections where it went up or down rather steeply. I made good time, although I was soaked in sweat all day. I told myself that it certainly beat cold and sleet, which has been my biggest concern. Tengo and I stopped for lunch at Marble Brook, yet another beautiful brook of which Maine has so many. Tengo, an avid fly fishermen, explained to me which flies he would use and where and how he would drop them into the water when (not if, but when) he returns for fishing. After lunch, we continued on to the west branch of the Piscataquis River. This is another major river that must be forded, and a rope is stretched across the river to hold onto so the current doesn't drag you downstream.  The water level was so low, however, that I was able to carefully walk across on some narrow logs that stretched across the river, and I didn't even get my feet wet.  Another hot three miles found me at Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to. Tengo, Gravity, and I had discussed the possibility of continuing on a few more miles to a possible stealth tent area near Shirley-Blanchard Road, but we decided that it was getting too late (5:00) and we should just call it a day. It was a bit of a walk to the stream for water (a closer spring was dry). I set up camp, cooked dinner, and headed for another early bedtime. I am presently nine miles from Monson. Another early departure is planned in the morning,  and I hope to reach Monson by late morning or early afternoon. As I noted before, Monson is the gateway to the 100 Mile Wilderness, which I will begin the day after tomorrow. I continue to try to be very careful while hiking along the slick rocks and roots. I learned from a southbounder today that another hiker who I know fell and broke her wrist yesterday in the same area I will hike tomorrow. Hopefully, I will remain injury-free as I begin the next,  and almost final, chapter of my thru hike.  I was told on a very clear day you can see Katahdin from Moxie Bald, but there was far too much haze today. It won't be too many more days, however, until I can see her, and then a few days after that to summit her, as my six-month journey nears its end.","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to

I woke up early, broke camp with no problem, and was on the trail as the sun came up at 6:30. The trail was relatively quite good with lots of roots and rocks, but nothing truly difficult. It humors me to think how several months ago I would have thought the trail today was difficult, while now I'm thrilled at how easy it was. Maine continues to be beautiful as I walked along streams, ponds, and even one view of distant mountains. I thought I might have to ford the East Branch of the Piscataquis River but was able to cross it without even getting my feet wet. My understanding is that there are rivers in the Wilderness that will actually have to be forded. Well, I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. The terrain was pretty flat, and I was at the road to Monson by 11:15.  A shuttle from Shaw's Hostel soon arrived and took me to the final hostel of my trip. Shaw's is operated by Poet and Hippy Chick, and they run a top notch operation. I got a special surprise when I arrived. Bartender and Minutes, who summitted a few days ago, are now working at the hostel. I also got to meet Bartender's dad, who came to Maine to summit with her. It was great to see Bartender and congratulate her in person. After settling in, I  showered and put my clothes in the laundry and then headed to downtown Monson. Gravity, Tengo, and I went to the Lakeshore Pub, where I ordered ""The Bomb,"" a steak and cheese extravaganza that must be experienced to be believed. The steak and cheese are cooked together and onions and peppers are added. It certainly lived up to its reputation as one of the finer foods on the trail. At the Pub, we saw Skittles and Jeff.  Skittles fell the day before yesterday and broke her wrist. She had surgery yesterday and plans on being back on trail Thursday. She plans on summitting on October 6th. I wish her the best of luck. I also saw Jason, Boomer, Single T, Scout, and Maple, who was under the table resting in the shade. They plan on summitting around the same time I do.  It's been wonderful spending time with these great young people the past few months.  After lunch, we went across the street to the AT Visitor's Center to learn about the Hundred Mile Wilderness and Baxter State Park, where Mount Katahdin is located. From there, I went to the gas station and the local grocery store for resupply. The cost of food was pretty high, and I needed to buy food for nine days. I finished off my resupply at Poet's well-stocked hiking store. We also met with him about the best way to approach hiking the Wilderness and arranged a food drop for half way through.  Poet's knowledge and insight were a big help, and I was pleased that the plan I had previously worked out for hiking through the Wilderness was quite close to his recommendations.   My plan is to summit Katahdin on October 5th, which will be six months to the day since I left home. Of course, I have some flexibility since the trail is never truly predictable.  I saved the most exciting news from today for last. My good hiking friends, Leapfrog and Extra Mile, summitted yesterday and sent me their photo. Ever the athletes, Extra Mile stands next to the Katahdin sign while Leapfrog is doing a handstand beside him. In their second photo, their positions have changed, and Extra Mile is on his knee proposing. I am so excited for these two very special young people and look forward to staying in touch with them in the years ahead. I again feel so blessed by the friendships I have developed within the trail community, and these relationships will keep my AT journey continuing long after I actually finish hiking the trail. It's now time to go to sleep, because there are still quite a few miles to go before I get my photo taken by the sign on Katahdin.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to

Poet asked me how I slept as I entered the hostel's kitchen this morning, and I was able to reply with one of my favorite corny jokes. ""I slept like a baby,"" I replied. ""Cried all night and woke up wet.""  One of the joys of the trail for me is to be continually surrounded by people who haven't already heard all of my jokes. I actually slept quite well and was packed and ready to go when I came down the steep stairs of the hostel for breakfast. Poet joked the first time I went upstairs that it was like summitting Mount Shaw. Breakfast was huge and included three eggs cooked to order (sunny side up for me), bacon, and fried potatoes. Mounds of blueberry pancakes rounded things out. Poet came in with a pancake cairn, which instantly became my favorite cairn of the AT. Bartender and Minutes helped prepare breakfast, and we shared a fond farewell when I left this morning. I promised to share my summit photo when I get to Katahdin. It was nearly 9:00 when we arrived back at the trailhead, which was nearly two and a half hours later than I have been starting out. Poet took a photo of the group of us and shared some thoughts and insights with us as we prepared to enter the Wilderness.  Poet is aptly named. The goal today was 14.2 miles to the north side of Long Pond Stream, but I realized what a challenge that would be, considering our late start. The first thing I encountered as I entered the Wilderness was a sign that warned of the lack of supply options and the rigors of the trail ahead. The morning hike wasn't too difficult, and I made good time. The weather was cooler and cloudy, so my views of Bell and Lily Ponds were foggy and hazy. There is an island in Lily Pond, which loomed out from the haze. Mud Pond is well named and looked like it might be home for beavers.  I arrived at Little Wilson Falls around noon and hiked the brief side trail to watch the water cascade down to the valley below. I then hiked down to that valley and crossed Little Wilson Stream. There is a campsite where the trail crosses the stream that is complete with an armed couch and love seat, all cleverly constructed from slate. There is even a sidetable by the couch that was complete with a TV remote, a small piece of slate with numbers scratched into its surface. Tengo and I reclined on the couch as we ate our lunch. After lunch, we filtered water and headed out. Gravity had joined us by then, and we discussed options if we didn't make it to our intended destination before dark. We decided to give it our best shot, with the understanding that we all have headlamps and could hike after dark. The trail from Little Wilson was quite steep as I hiked up a ravine. I crossed railroad tracks on the way up, the first time I have done that in many weeks. I then hiked down the other side of the ravine and walked along Big Wilson Stream for awhile before the trail turned to cross it. This proved to be my first actual river fording. I removed my socks and took the inserts from my shoes before putting them back on. I pinned up my pants legs as well. The ford of the stream actually felt quite good on my feet. The riverbed was rocky and very slick, so I spread out my poles and took my time. The water reached a bit above my knees. I was soon across.  Whitters, a hiker I met just this morning, crossed right after me, and I got a photo. River crossings take time, and it was becoming increasingly apparent that I would be hiking after dark.  The trail crossed a talus field of hundreds of boulders as it approached Long Pond Steam, which slowed progress even more. I got out my headlamp around 6:30. It's been awhile since I've hiked after dark, and I had forgotten that it can actually be quite enjoyable. Reaching our intended campsite would involve crossing Long Pond Stream, another larger stream that might require actual fording. The search for a suitable stealth campsite ultimately revealed a snug little area just north of Vaughn Stream, a mere half mile from Long Pond Stream. I set up camp, got water from the stream, and cooked dinner. Throwing a bear rope can be a challenge after dark, but I had no trouble finding a suitable branch and was successful on my first throw.  I was ready for bed by nine o'clock,  which is quite late by today's standard. I'm lying in my tent listening to the music of the stream. I just read in Guthooks that there is a twenty foot waterfall just beyond where the trail crosses, and I plan on checking that out in the morning.  There promises to be mountains and some challenging trail conditions tomorrow,  so I am heading back to sleep to be ready for my second day in the Wilderness.","ME 15/Monson/Shaw's Hostel

While the second half of the 100 Mile Wilderness is famously flat as you head to Katahdin, the first half has its share of mountains.  Today was a mountain day. True to Maine form, I had my share of bouldering and extremely steep ascents and descents. It rained last night, and I heard one long, loud thunder roll, but the day dawned chilly and windy, but dry. I was on the trail by 6:45 this morning, knowing I would be climbing today.  The first challenge was fording Long Pond Stream. The water was low, and I was able to rock hop across. The ascent up Barren Mountain began immediately after. The climb up to Barren Ledges was pretty steep, but then there was a long ridge walk before the final climb to the top. The remnants of an old fire tower remain on the summit. The view from the Ledges was best, allowing me a fine view.  From Barren Mountain, I then descended to Fourth Mountain Bog,  which you travel across on a long boardwalk. I then completed a roller coaster hike of varying difficulty up and down Fourth Mountain, Mount Three and a Half, Third Mountain, and Columbus Mountain.  The descent down Mount Three and a Half was particularly challenging. A helicopter circled near me for a long time early this afternoon, and I was initially concerned that it was involved in a rescue operation. It was while I was climbing Mount Three and a Half that I smelled smoke, and I saw plumes of smoke from a nearby area while on the summit. Gravity told me later that he had seen Wendy, the woman we met at the ATC Visitor Center in Monson, on a day hike, and she confirmed that there was a forest fire in the area. I was never in any danger from the fire, and I have no other information. Near today's destination of Chairback Gap Lean-to, I passed the number 2100 spelled out in sticks. This is the last such number I will be passing, as I had only 89.8 miles to go as I passed the number. The last 0.4 miles of the trail into the shelter has been recently rerouted, and I was surprised to find an easy, round about trail devoid of any rock scrambles or root wads. Again, I have no other information, but it certainly felt odd to be walking on spongy, not rocky trail. The old trail was still readily apparent, and it appeared to be more direct but more difficult. If nothing else, it was a cause for conversation when I arrived in camp. It was pleasant to be able to set up camp before dark, although I ended up cooking by headlamp. There aren't a whole lot of camping options tomorrow, and I hope to be able to make it to Logan Brook Lean-to, 16.8 miles to the north. There are still several mountains between me and there, and I understand the descent of Chairback Mountain is particularly difficult. I'll be setting out early again tomorrow and will just have to see how things work out. Today was an interesting, challenging day, and I expect tomorrow to be the same.","Stealth Campsite near Vaughn Stream

I heard the wind blowing in the trees all night long, and I awoke to a chilly, windy morning. I got up at five and broke camp by the light of my headlamp. The wind was so strong that I needed to weigh my tent down with rocks as I folded and then rolled it up. I was on the trail by 6:45. Today was another mountain day. The first obstacle was coming down from Chairback Mountain. The trail passes through a rock slide of huge boulders, and I spent a challenging half hour scrambling down through this boulder field. The trail became more normal after that as I hiked on to the West Branch Pleasant River. The wind died down, and it became yet another perfect hiking day. There was no way to rock hop across the Pleasant River, so I again prepared to ford it. The water only reached about half way to my knees and was very cold. It was crystal clear, and I was able to see where to place my feet. The guidebook warned that it was a wide ford with a slick, rocky bottom, which proved an accurate description. I crossed without incident and was soon hiking on. The ascent of Gulf Hagus Mountain was long but not too steep for the first four and a half miles. I ate lunch by Gulf Hagus Brook with several other hikers, including Tengo, Jason and Maple, Boomer, Special T, Scout, Wiskers, and Dr. Gomo. It was fun sharing the camaraderie, made a little bittersweet since we all knew the trip was drawing to a close. The final mile of the ascent past the brook was extremely steep, as was the subsequent ascent of West Peak. Just past the summit of West Peak, I saw the letter K with and arrow (K -->) painted on a rock. I puzzled for a few moments as I looked in the direction of the arrow, and then I saw it. Still far in the distance, I had my first sighting of Mount Katahdin. It was quite a moment.  I took a photo but couldn't get the camera to focus on the mountain, the view of which was sandwiched between two trees. I was lucky the sky was so clear that the mountain was visible from seventy-six miles away.  I continued on up Hay Mountain which, while not particulary steep, was a long ascent. Not far past its summit, I arrived at a stealth camping spot near the AT's junction with the White Brook Trail. Tengo, Gravity, and I set up camp, cooked dinner, and prepared for the night.  We got there at 5:45, so we had almost an hour before dark. It's quite chilly tonight, and I am wearing my puffy coat, hat, and gloves to bed.  With their help, I am quite cozy.  The first thing tomorrow, I will hike up and over White Cap Mountain and later in the day will do the same with Little Boardman Mountain. Those are the last mountains I will climb until the last day, when I summit Katahdin.  I presently am less than seventy miles from its base, as my six month journey continues to draw to a close. I remain amazed and humbled at the beauty and vastness of nature as I pass through the Wilderness, but I am also excited about returning home to my family and friends.  I'm sure most, if not all, thru hikers experience these same emotions.","Chairback Gap Lean-to

Today was another early rising day, and I was already getting ready when my alarm went off at 5:00. With darkness setting in so early, it may seem late, but I am in bed usually by around 8:00, which makes getting up early pretty easy. Today is a red-letter day in that I climbed the last two mountains I will climb until I reach Katahdin. The trail immediately started up White Cap Mountain, which was steep and rocky, but not overly difficult. The views from the summit included a fascinating mix of clouds, haze, and sunlight. There was an excellent view of Katahdin, growing ever closer. I remained on the top for awhile, as it was the last summit with a view I will have save for Katahdin. The descent was long but, again, not difficult and led to the East Branch of the Pleasant River.  My guidebook called for fording the river, but rock hopping proved to be sufficient. It was actually more like large boulder hopping, and I got across safely with dry feet.  Tengo and I ate lunch by the shore of Mountain View Pond. It is a beautiful pond and a tremendous place to relax and eat lunch. Immediately after eating, we began the ascent of Little Boardman Mountain, which proved to be very similar to our last ascents.  The summit afforded no views, but the woods through which we climbed were quite beautiful with the sunlight shining amongst the trees. After descending Little Boardman, the trail leveled out, and I was able to simply hike for the rest of the day. There were certainly rocky areas, roots, and boardwalks over mud, but, as I discussed many months ago in Virginia, these areas were more like punctuation to add a bit of interest to otherwise easy hiking. Tengo and I reached Copper Brook Falls Lean-to and marveled at the waterfall that flows right in front of the shelter. It was just a bit after 4:00, so we decided to continue on to Jo-Mary Road. The trail remained conducive to easy hiking, and we arrived at a stealth campsite near the road before 6:00. While I was getting water, I met Ryan and Bronwyn, who are doing a few day backpacking trip.  They are both very friendly and personable. Ryan told me he comes to this area a few times a year to provide Trail Magic to hikers by barbecuing hamburgers and hot dogs. He and Bronwy shared some dried mangoes with us, which were delicious. An avid fisherman, Ryan and Tengo discussed the types of fish in the rivers and the best way to fish them. I'm beginning to wonder if Tengo may just move to Maine after he completes the trail so he can fish these beautiful waters to his heart's content.  I can sleep in tomorrow, as we are meeting Poet with a food drop at 9:00. It should take me three more days to travel through the rest of the Wilderness and reach Baxter State Park. Then, one more day to hike to the Birches, the starting point for climbing Mount Katahdin. My plan remains to summit on October 5th. It looks like Beau's father, Kim, and my wife, Sandy, will be there waiting for me after I climb down from the summit. It's hard to believe I'm this close to the end. It has been a great adventure, and it is very exciting to think I am this close to completing my thru hike. As I have done all along, however, I'll continue taking it one day at a time until I reach the end.","Stealth Campsite by White Brook Trail

I took advantage of the fact that our food drop wasn't scheduled until 9:00 to sleep in this morning. It was wonderful to lie in my sleeping bag and watch the day begin. Tomorrow it will be back to getting up at five o'clock to take advantage of the available daylight. Gary, from Shaw's, was right on time and even brought a thermos of coffee, which really hit the spot. By the time we had everything packed up, it was ten o'clock when we hit the trail. I was able to check the weather forecast, as I was surprised to have service at the road. The good news was that the sunny weather is expected to last several more days. The bad news is that rain is in the forecast for Thursday, the day I have hoped to summit. Tengo, Gravity, and I discussed it, and we are going to try to up our mileage to try to be able to summit on Wednesday instead. It will prove a challenge, but we think we can do it. The trail for the first several miles was very good, and I made excellent time. The trail followed alongside a brook, which provided yet another example of the beauty of Maine. After about four miles, I arrived at Antlers Campsite, which lies on the shore of Jo-Mary Lake. It's a shame I wasn't able to stop for the night, as the campsites were well placed and the views of the lake were spectacular. I decided noon was a tad early to call it a day. After Antlers, the trail became much more rooty and rocky. After climbing the only hill for the day, I arrived at Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to and had lunch with Tengo and Gravity. We decided we would try to get as far as we could before dark, especially if the trail remained the way it was. The chance of getting hurt by tripping over a root in the dark this close to the end is just too real. The trail followed alongside a beautiful stream for several miles.  I waited until I was almost out of water before stopping to filter more, as I figured there was no sense carrying it if I was walking next to it. The trail was an interesting mishmash of roots, rocks, water, mud, and sunshine. I took a photo, but my poor camera didn't know what to think. The resulting photo is quite unique. The trail eventually left the stream by climbing over a ridge. It was here that I met Joanie, Emmy-Lou, Spencer, and Gideon. These four make up one of the more interesting hiking families I have met. They were camped along the trail, waiting for their friend, Protector of the Universe, to arrive so they could hike together. Joanie, who is a person, and Emmy-Lou, a dog, were too shy to be photographed. Spencer and Gideon had no problem with having their pictures taken, which made me happy as they are the first goats I have seen hiking the AT. The trail soon paralleled a stream again, as I approached Nahmakanta Lake. I was still a few miles from where I hoped to be, but it was getting dark and the roots and rocks were still out in force. I began looking for a stealth site large enough for three tents when I smelled a campfire. I came out of the woods near Nahmakanta Lake and saw a very nice campsite with a man sitting by a fire. He immediately invited me over. This is how I met Two-Toned Albatross, an avid hiker who had been providing Trail Magic from this campsite for the past two days. He apologized that he was all out of chili, but did offer me a cup of tea. I realized I had found home for the night and quickly set up my tent as darkness set in. I did take time to check out Nahmakanta Lake as the sun went down. Simply beautiful.    Tengo and Gravity arrived soon after I did, and we cooked dinner and chatted with Two-Tone. He explained that he received his unique trail name from friends, because an Albatross is a strange bird and because he got badly sunburned once while wearing a short-sleeve shirt. He has hiked extensively on the AT and wanted to give back to the trail by supporting thru hikers as they approach Katahdin. He is another example of the special, unique personalities that make the AT community so special. Thanks again, Two-Tone, for the fellowship and the tea!  I had to turn down an invitation to sit by the fire and continue chatting, because hiker midnight arrived early. The plan is to be up at five and ready to hike by daybreak. If we can make good miles the next two days, then we should be able to summit on Wednesday. If we are delayed, we can always take our chances with Thursday. As I learned so well in the Whites, however, storms can get pretty nasty at altitude, and I would hate to have to delay my summit until the weather improved. I have thirty-six miles to cover in two days if I am to summit on Wednesday, so I best get back to sleep to be ready for tomorrow.","Stealth Campsite by Jo-Mary Road

I knew it was going to be a long day today if we hoped to make it to Baxter by Tuesday. I was up before my alarm and was ready to hike by 6:30. Two-Tone got up early as well and offered me a cup of coffee, which I gratefully accepted.  Thanks, again, Two-Tone for your Trail Magic!  I wrote earlier that I was done with mountains until Katahdin, but I forgot to consider little Nesuntabunt Mountain, which I climbed this morning.  Along the way, there is a small, stone cubicle that looks like a little house. I jokingly called it Fred and Barney's summer cottage, and Tengo posed by the door for a photo.  At the summit, there is a short side trail that provides a magnificent view of Katahdin, just sixteen line-of-sight miles away.  Katahdin has a very distinct profile and seems to rise up from the flat lands around it, and the view from Nesuntabunt was imposing to say the least. Tengo stated that Katahdin looked prehistoric, and I understand his point.  I was only thirty-six miles from her base at this point, and I could feel the excitement growing, realizing I will be on her summit very soon. The trail for the rest of the day was rooty and rocky, but not overly difficult. The weather was yet again picture perfect, with a clear blue sky and cool temperatures.  I passed by several ponds and hiked alongside mountain brooks that filled the air with the sounds of rushing water, as I hiked beside a myriad of small, turbulent waterfalls. Any attempt to capture these with photos seemed doomed to failure, but I gave it a shot anyway.  I will always consider being able to experience the magnificence of the natural beauty of Maine in truly idyllic conditions as one of the most special blessings of my thru hike.  I must admit I was ready for today's hike to be over when I arrived at a stealth campsite along the shore of Rainbow Lake at six o'clock.  I had covered eighteen miles and, while a touch weary, soon had my tent up and my bear rope up before dark. I went down to the lake to capture yet another beautiful end of the day, as the sunlight glowed orange against the water of the lake. Tengo, Gravity, and I shared a quiet evening of conversation as we prepared our suppers. I added a tuna salad tortilla to the menu, as I now have an extra day's food in my pack. If I eat it, I don't have to carry it, and I know the extra calories will be welcome as we have another long day tomorrow.  I am presently 7.9 miles from Abol Bridge, the entrance to Baxter State Park,  and 17.8 miles from The Birches Campsite, from where my hike up Katahdin will begin. I should be there tomorrow night. Sandy flies to Providence, Rhode Island tomorrow, so she and Beau's parents will be able to be there when I return from my summit. After all this time, the actual hiking part of my Appalachian Trail adventure is drawing to a close. I'm sure there will be lots of reflection and perhaps even some insights in the future, but for right now I have those 17.8 miles to consider, so I'm going back to lie back, listen to the calls of the night birds, and go back to sleep now to be better prepared for them tomorrow.","Campsite near Nahmakanta Lake

It was another early morning, and I was already getting started when my alarm went off at five o'clock. Today's goal was the Katahdin Stream Campground at the base of my final summit.  The weather today was absolutely beautiful and a bit warmer than yesterday. I went down to say goodbye to Rainbow Lake and to capture its morning look in a photograph. The first objective today was Rainbow Ledges, which proved to be an easy ascent, which felt more like a walk in the woods. There was a great view of Katahdin, again drawing ever larger. The last few miles of the 100 Mile Wilderness passed by quickly. Less than a mile to the end of the Wilderness, as I was crossing yet another bog on a boardwalk made of split logs, I noticed a set of wet dog prints on one of the logs. I became excited, because it didn't take the deductive reasoning of Sherlock Holmes to realize that the prints were probably Maple's, and they had to be fresh since they hadn't dried yet in the sun. I was soon standing on Golden Road, the road into Baxter State Park. I turned right and followed the road to Abol Bridge, the entrance to the park. Sure enough, a red minivan was parked by the bridge, and there I caught up with Maple, Jason, Boomer, Special T, and Scout. Dogs are not allowed in Baxter, so Maple's hike is done.  I got to meet Jason's parents and sister, and we had a great chat about the wonderful attributes of their son and his dog. Scout encouraged me to go stand on the bridge, which turned out to be another excellent vantage point in which to view Mount Katahdin. I am thrilled that I will be summitting on the same day as Jason and Boomer, who have become two of my favorite people on the trail.  I crossed the bridge and stopped at the store there and met Long Jon, the Trail Steward for Baxter State Park.  He explained how the park operated and helped me register for a campsite at Katahdin Spring Campground. As I have come to expect in Maine, Long Jon was as helpful and as friendly as he could be. I know he has worked with hundreds of thru hikers completing their journeys, but he made us all feel special.  Each site in the campground can hold up to six people, so Sir Poops-A-Lot and his girlfriend, Corrina, joined Gravity, Tengo, and me at Campsite #24.  I've known Sir Poops-A-Lot for awhile now. I'll never forget when someone asked him how he got his trail name. He gazed at the questioner for a few seconds and slowly responded, ""Well, it's because I poop a lot."" He is a fine young man, and we were all glad to meet Corinna, who joined Sir Poops-A-Lot to hike the Wilderness with him.  There was a strong feeling of reaching a major goal at the store (not to mention food, coffee, and Gatorade), so I had to shake myself and remember that I still had over ten miles to hike through the park to reach the campground.  I left the store around 1:00 for my final destination short of the summit itself.  Most of the ten miles was easy hiking, following for a good while alongside the Penobscot River,  another spectacular sight.  The trail was not without its challenges, however. In fact, I had a bit of a problem while attempting to cross the lower fork of the Nesowadnehunk Stream. I have successfully crossed literally hundreds of streams and brooks in the past six months by rock hopping and log balancing. Today, with just ten miles to go, I had my first mishap. I first crossed half the stream on a pair of narrow logs that were supported by a large boulder in the middle.  From that boulder, there was a second boulder, but I determined it was too far for this old man with short legs to jump to it. I was perched rather precariously on the boulder surveying the situation and noticed a small, wet rock below the boulder I was on and adjacent to another boulder that I thought would get me closer to the bank. I attempted to step down to the rock, but my foot slipped off of it. I went knee deep into the stream but was able to catch myself by falling into the large boulder. As it turned out, the only consequences were me being wet up to my knee with a skinned up left elbow. No harm done, but it did serve as a reminder that the journey isn't over until it's over.  I took a brief side trail to see Little Niagara Falls, and received yet another great view of another beautiful waterfall. I met a very nice couple near there, named Cookie and Dennison. We chatted for awhile, and they asked me how I felt I have changed and what effect my hike has had on me. I didn't have much of an answer, but we spent a good while talking about the beauty of the place we were in, and I offered to defend their state of Pennsylvania against all comers. I was in a contemplative mood anyway, and I had miles of relatively easy walking to think upon the upcoming completion of my hike. As a distance runner, I have often had people ask me what I think about while I am in the middle of an hours-long practice run. I've never been able to answer that question with any answer other than, ""You know, I think about stuff."" Today, I made an effort to keep track as my mind wandered from the people I have met and the adventures I have had, to the excitement of returning home to friends and loved ones and what new adventures I will be finding, to the people who have contacted me through my journal and what it has meant to them. I made one actual decision. Jason and Boomer both attended Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina. I plan on modeling two of the 1920s era buildings from the school on my model railroad, which terminates in Boone.  Jason and Boomer will be by one of the buildings holding books, while Maple will be beside them with papers in her mouth. ""But, Teacher, my dog really did eat my homework!""  In a more serious vein, I also thought about the fact that while the actual hiking part will soon be over, in what directions will this journey now lead me?  I really don't have any answers yet. Also, this being the AT, it was never long before a huge root wad, rock scramble, or muddy bog would show up that required undivided attention and interupt my reverie.  I was reminded again of one fact of the trail, which is to always remain in the moment. I was crossing a long boardwalk over a muddy bog and had almost gotten to the end of the last flattened log. I looked up for a second to see where the trail would lead, and with my very last step before leaving the boardwalk, my left foot slipped off of the log, and I went ankle deep in oozy mud. Lesson relearned yet again.  I made it to the campground and was heading for the Ranger Station when I heard someone yell, ""Stick!"" I turned and found myself running across the field to share a big hug with Mechanic. Right behind him was Pippi. These two tremendous people summitted today, and I am so happy that I was able to see them again. We have been sharing text messages, but nothing is as good as actually seeing them. I was also able to meet Pippi's mom and dad, who were there to share this special moment. So many of my friends are finishing, as Juan Gone, Uncle Puck, and Splat have all sent me their summit photos, in addition to Dapper Dan and Alex. Splat and Bartender summitted with their fathers, which seems extra special. I guess tomorrow I will begin sending out my summit photo, which hardly seems possible.  I'll also be seeing Sandy and Beau's dad, Kim, who will be here to share my completion. Gravity, Tengo, and I will be hiking up together, which seems like a fitting way to bring this stage of my journey to an end. Of course, it is late now, and Katahdin is a very challenging climb, so I'll close and go back to sleep, remembering that I need to remain in the moment.","Stealth Campsite by Rainbow Lake

Today was summit day. After nearly six months of walking through fourteen states in all different kinds of conditions, the hike ended today. It was a sureal feeling to pack up camp, knowing it was for the last time. Climbing Katahdin is considered one of the bigger challenges on the AT. While many peaks are part of a ridgeline, Katahdin rises up alone. The 5.2 mile climb to the summit rises 4,169 feet. Tengo, Gravity, and I left at 7:00. The climb was everything it was reported to be, and I felt a range of emotions as I neared the summit. The peak was covered in clouds with a brisk wind blowing when I arrived at the famous summit sign at 12:15, after a more than five hour climb. Several other thru hikers were there. I took my turn climbing onto the sign to have my summit photo taken. I asked for everyone's attention, explained a bit about Beau, and set the rest of him free into the winds over Katahdin. We made it, Beau! A thru hiker spends so much time focusing on the summit, that the reality of the descent tends to be overlooked. The only way down from Katahdin is to walk. After we had a group photo of the three of us taken, Tengo, Gravity, and I began our hike down the Saddle Trail, which would eventually lead us to Roaring Brook Campground, where our loved ones would meet us. While the ascent was made challenging by large boulders and rock faces, the descent took us down a rock slide which presented all new challenges. We were met about halfway down by Gravity's two sons, Logan and Landon, who hiked up to meet their dad. We arrived at Roaring Brook at 6:00, and my AT thru hike officially ended. Sandy and Kim were waiting for me. As we left the park, I turned in my yellow slip at the main gate. Everyone who hikes Katahdin is required to obtain a yellow slip from the Ranger Station and to turn it in as they leave the park. This is their way of keeping track if anyone is left on the mountain.  One man, who like me had just finished his thru hike, apparently broke his hand during his descent of the Saddle. Fortunately, I escaped with nothing but some superficial abrasions and a bruised knee. Kim, Sandy, and I drove to Millinocket, where we checked into the Katahdin Inn and then went to dinner at the local Chinese restaurant. Tomorrow we are meeting Tengo and his wife, Gravity and his family, Sir Poops-A-Lot, and Corrina at the AT Cafe for breakfast. I understand that thru hikers get to sign a ceiling tile.  From there, we will drive to Providence to spend a few days with Kim and Sue, and then fly home to Missouri. It will take awhile for the reality of being a successful thru hiker, Class of 2017, to sink in. Tengo and I discussed how our friends and loved ones have also been growing and changing while we have been away tramping up and down mountains. I'm excited about completing my trek and returning home. I certainly feel a sense of accomplishment on completing a forty-year dream. I guess time will tell what, if any, changes were brought about by my adventure. I plan on continuing with my journal until I am back home in a more regular routine. One of my favorite songs is Glory Days, by Bruce Springsteen. In particular, I find the line about sitting around and telling boring stories of glory days to be most compelling. For years, my outdoor buddies at home have had a rule. While it's fine to talk about our past adventures, every conversation must include talk about new, upcoming adventures. I'm not sure in what direction my new adventures will take me, but I do know I will have, God willing, many more of them. I'm going back to sleep in my hotel room now, content in the knowledge that whatever decisions I make tomorrow, they will not include how many miles I plan to walk. Beau and I made it, and that's enough for me for now. I want to thank everyone who has been reading my journal. Your interest and support mean the world to me. I wish you all many adventures, because life is short and there is all sorts of stuff to do.","Katahdin Stream Campground

I woke up today, and for the first time in nearly six months I was not figuring out how many miles I would hike today.  Kim, Sandy, and I went to the Appalachian Trail Cafe for breakfast and met up with our little group. Tengo, Gravity, and I all followed an old AT tradition and signed a ceiling tile. While we are all going our separate ways, we have developed a bond of friendship that will continue into the future. I ordered one of my favorite breakfasts, pancakes with sunnyside up eggs. I like to cut the eggs into the pancakes. I decided to forgo the butter and syrup, something I wouldn't have thought about doing yesterday. It appears my old eating habits are already coming into play. This is good, because if I continued to eat the number of calories I have been eating, who knows what I would end up weighing. The drive to Providence went without incident. We arrived in mid-afternoon. It was wonderful seeing Sue again. We visited a while before deciding to go to dinner at Antonio's Pizza. We enjoyed a large Beaurider pizza.  Nearly every day when he worked near the restaurant,  Beau would order a rather unique pizza consisting of breaded chicken, cheese filled tortellini, mozzarella cheese, and basil pesto sauce. When he died, the restaurant officially added the Beaurider to its menu. Ten years later it is still there. It was definitely different, but I liked it. We then went back to their house and had a relaxing evening visiting and watching the Patriots on television. I went to bed early. Sandy and I will visit with the Wennemarks until Sunday morning, when we will fly home to Missouri.  It's a good way to begin to bring closure to my six-month adventure.",,View Entry,"Oct 05, Thu",0

We had a wonderful time in Providence and Pawtucket today. We went to the Modern Diner for breakfast this morning. Built in 1941, the Modern Diner was the first diner to be accepted on the National Register of Historic Places. The food and service were great. We ate at the counter. I had the Famous Jimmie Gimmie, two poached eggs on English muffins with sliced tomatoes and topped with melted cheese and bacon, served with fried potatoes. It had every right to be famous.  Strawberry crepes rounded out the meal. Delicious. After breakfast, Sue and Kim took us on a driving tour of Providence. We stopped at a small park with a great view of the city. The capital building was front and center. We then returned to their home and chilled out for awhile.  We then headed for the Pawtucket Bucket Brewery. A small brewery, I had a flight of their excellent beers. I talked with Nate, the owner and head brewer. I enjoyed all six of the beers I tried in my flight. Surprisingly, there was not an IPA on tap. I particularly liked the Black Goat of the Woods Spiced Irish Milk Stout. From there, we went to the Viva Mexico Restaurant for another excellent meal. We then headed for the Trinity Brewhouse, where I had the Maple Brown, with Vermont maple syrup added. It was very tasty. Providence definitely boasts a strong craft beer scene. It was then back to the house for a well-earned nap. We then headed for  Foolproof Brewing Company for an evening of stand-up comedy. Four local comedians put on a good show. Afterwards, we stopped by a neighbor's house and sat around a fire chatting.  It was then time to return home and go to bed. We had a busy day that was also relaxing, since we were never in a hurry (and took a car wherever we went). Sandy and I will spend one more day with the Wennermarks before flying home on Sunday.

I woke up around five o'clock after an interesting and somewhat disconcerting dream of hiking down a long, narrow pathway in the dark toward a sliver of light. It took a few minutes for the confusion to subside and for me to realize where I was. I often have vivid dreams and usually enjoy them. Years ago, during a stressful time at work soon after I became a building administrator, I started having reoccuring dreams that always included the Gilligan and Skipper. I would be in some quandary, and Gilligan and the Skipper would try to help but only succeeded in making things worse. I had numerous such dreams over a period of several months. It was near Christmas time, and I was staying the night with my mom in St. Louis, when I had yet another of these dreams, which did not make for restful sleep. I was about ready to drive home to Rolla, and I told Mom that I was going to take a short power nap before leaving. It was then that my Spirit Otter and Spirit Weasel came to help. They walked into my dream, told me that they knew I was under a lot of stress, and asked if they could help.  I told them that if they could find a way to do it without hurting their feelings, since they really were trying to help, I would so much appreciate if they could find a way to get Gilligan and Skipper out of my dreams. They told me they would see what they could do. That has been several years ago, and neither Gilligan nor Skipper have ever been in a dream of mine since. Neither have Spirit Otter or Spirit Weasel, but I trust they are in the background in case I ever need their help again. Somehow, I find this very comforting. I packed up most of my backpacking gear into my pack and put it in the stow bag so I can get it all home on the airplane. The bottoms of my water bottle pouches are pretty much shredded, and both the stay adjustment straps on the bottom are gone. Field repairs got me through, although I had to start putting my big water bottle in my mesh pouch on the last day. I think I'll contact ZPacks about returning it for repair. Considering what that pack went through, particularly in the Whites and Southern Maine, I feel it did a fine job for me.  I then came downstairs and simply sat on Sue and Kim's large, screened porch and watched the world go by for awhile. Saturday is Farmers' Market Day at the park across the street, and I watched as people set up for it. Sue prepared a huge breakfast. After eating, we headed for the Farmers' Market. There were many vendors selling everything from locally grown produce to craft items. We had a great time walking around with Maizy and Maggie, the two dogs that Sue and Kim are dog sitting. I stopped by Yacht Club Soda's tent. Yacht Club Soda has been in business for over 100 years and are famous for their unique flavors. I purchased a grapefruit soda and an orange cream soda that tasted exactly like a liquid dreamsicle. They were both delicious. We then walked down to Beau's Bench that Sue and Kim had installed on Blackstone Boulevard in Beau's memory.  Beau's Bench was featured in the movie, ""Irrational Man."" Joaquin Phoenix is seen sitting on the bench, although you can't see the plaque.  After resting and talking for a bit, we headed back to the Farmers' Market. We passed by a duo playing Irish Pub Rock. They were playing Whiskey in the Jar, one of my favorite Dubliners songs, as the wee ones danced. We listened for awhile before returning to the house. The humans held up well, but Maizy and Maggie were pretty much done in and chilled out on the porch. Sisters, the two dogs are basically joined at the hip and do not like to be separated. We ate a light lunch and visited on the porch for the rest of the afternoon.  It was wonderful sitting on the porch watching the world go by. Sue and Kim provide a kind of Trail Magic by providing a jar of dog treats by their house for all comers. It was great fun chatting with the puppies and their humans who stopped by for a doggie treat.  It's good to know that Trail Magic can happen anywhere.  We had a quiet dinner, and then surprised Sue with a birthday cake and visited until time for bed. Sandy and I will be leaving for home tomorrow. We'll spend the rest of tomorrow into the next day with Becky in Columbia. She'll drive us home on Monday, and I will be back to where I started from on April 5th.  To quote Jerry Garcia from Gravity's favorite band, The Grateful Dead,  ""Lately, it occurs to me . . . What a long, strange trip it's been.""",,View Entry,"Oct 07, Sat",0

I slept well on my last night in Providence, although I did have at least one more hiking in the night dream. I woke up more easily from this one than the one last night. Kim went to church with us this morning, and I attended Mass for the first time since I left home. St. Raymonds is a beautiful church with very impressive stain glass windows. Returning to Mass is another step in re-entering my regular life and routine. We returned to Sue and Kim's house for another great breakfast. Sandy and I finished packing, and we spent the rest of our time visiting on the porch. A light rain was falling. It was a good feeling to be warm and dry under a roof while still being able to enjoy the sight, sound, and smell of the rain through the screens. We left for the airport at 2:30 and arrived in plenty of time for our 4:37 flight to Chicago. I checked my backpack, having placed it in the bag carrier I borrowed from Becky. It occurred to me that it is the first time I have been separated from my backpack since April 5th. My backpack has basically served as my surrogate home for the past six months, but there was no separation anxiety here, so I guess I really am ready to reintegrate into my more normal, post thru-hike life. The flight to Chicago was uneventful. After months of views of sunrises and sunsets, and the one special day when I stood on a ridge above the clouds, I found myself looking down on sunlit clouds in a more conventional way by being on an airplane. Nature's beauty can be found in many places.  I was also surprised to discover that I needed to add one more example in the privy photo series. Landing squarely in the ""I'd never think of this in a million years"" category, the toilets at O'Hare airport now sport automatic toilet seat covers. The would-be user touches the Start button, and a plastic sleeve slides along the toilet seat, providing a sterile, germ-free environment on which to place your tush. I was amazed. After months of privies, cat holes, rationed toilet paper, and hand sanitizer, I guess I can safely say that I have definitely left the trail. We took off after dark from O'Hare on a clear night. The lights of Chicago as seen from my plane window were quite a display of human-created beauty. I observed a highway cloverleaf with the road illuminated by small pools of light from the tiny cars as they traveled along the road, looking all the world like slow-moving, lighted beads on a chain. Simply gorgeous. From the air at least. I'm not sure the drivers on the congested roadway below would agree with my assessment.  The flight went by quickly, and we were soon in Columbia.  Becky met us and we headed to her apartment.  We had a great chat and watched the first episode of the new Star Trek series.

I slept well in Becky's guest room except for the dream of hiking along rocky trail trying to get to her apartment. At least it was not terribly difficult trail. Once again, I woke up only mildly confused. I was able to spend some time with Becky this morning at her office at KBIA Radio in Columbia. She is a Health and Wealth reporter and recently initiated a new program called Missouri Health Talks, which focuses on capturing conversations between everyday Missourians about access to health care. An award winning journalist, Becky has parents who spend their time being extremely proud of her.  If you are interested in her stories, they can be accessed at missourihealthtalks.org or kbia.org. I then took my trekking pole to Alpine Shop and dropped it off so it can be repaired.  I walked there from Becky's office and then back to the parking garage. I spent a rather unproductive fifteen minutes wandering through the parking garage looking for her car (I forgot to make an arrow out of sticks to show me the way) and finally had to break down and call Becky to have her help direct me to her car. Six months on the trail and my inability to orient myself in a parking garage remains unchanged. Sigh. We picked Becky up after she taught her Introduction to Multi-Media Journalism class. She works very hard at this and is quite popular with her students. After her first semester teaching, a student thanked her afterwards for clearly giving a sh*t.  I've suggested she have that put on a t-shirt. We ate lunch at the Broadway Diner, where Becky and I usually eat breakfast after our practice runs. The lunch special was also tasty, and I continue to eat well but only about half as much as I did while on the trail. I'm also back to unsweetened ice tea instead of soda. Reconversion continues. We watched the third episode of the new Star Trek, and I think I'm hooked. Becky then drove us to Jefferson City, where we met Stephen and my friend, Sharon. We had dinner at Arris' Bistro. Sandy and I then loaded our stuff in Stephen's car, and he drove us the rest of the way home. After six months and five days, I arrived back to where I started. Time will tell what impact my six month hiatus will have on my life, but I am already giving thought to my next projects. Tomorrow, I plan on visiting my schools and letting the students see me with my beard. I'll then return home to shave and then back to Rolla for a haircut. I know I will forever cherish the friendships I developed on the trail, and my absence from my friends from home has helped me realize how much I appreciate them. To all of you who read my journal, thank you so much. Your support has meant the world to me.

While I was gone, my friends, Glen and Murph, have initiated pointless, retired guys Wednesday excursions into their weekly itinerary. Today's trip involved a trip to Columbia to visit the oldest tree in Missouri. The huge burr oak is estimated to be close to 400 years old and, unfortunately, is dying. I was told it will probably be dead in two years, although it didn't look all that sick to me.  We first went to Eagle Bluffs to bird watch but saw very few. We did see a fair number of Herons, however.  After visiting the tree, we drove the rest of the way to Columbia and had lunch with Becky.  We had a great time, although visiting Becky made the trip not entirely pointless. Tomorrow is the welcome back party, and I shave after that, which should pretty much wrap up my AT adventure except for the fact I have already been approached by several people about putting together a presentation about my journey. I've started sorting through photos so we'll have to see.",,View Entry,"Oct 18, Wed",0

My family hosted a wonderful welcome back party for me this evening at the Rolla Public House Brewing Company. A large number of my friends and family attended, including my brother, Mark, and my sister-in-law, Lynn, and my sister, Marjorie, and my brother-in-law, Paul. My niece, Jessie, and my nephew, Nate, also attended. Of course, Sandy, Stephen, and Becky were there. Lisa, Christy, Landon, and Maylei were also there, and it's exciting to be able to spend time with them again.  I was blown away by the number of friends who stopped by to share the evening. Stephen put together a PowerPoint presentation with nearly 350 of the photos from my journal that continually played during the party. There was lots of food, including twelve-feet of sub sandwiches, vegetables, and fruit. I contributed a backpackers' gourmet section which included miniature granola bars, nutty buddy bars, and peanut butter crackers.  Perhaps (and only perhaps) the favorite food item was the mini Spam burrito tray that Sandy and I put together, which consisted of tiny tortillas, tiny Spam squares, and tiny cheese pieces. There was also a cake with my summit photo done in icing. The Public House pulled out all the stops to help make the event a success, and our server, Sabrina, was the best. I brought my gear from the trip and answered any questions about it. I also brought a mock-up of my summit card, which I will soon have printed to send to the people and places who helped make my thru hike a success. My friend, Jennifer, gave me an old Cub Scout promise plaque. Randy, a good friend and member of my homebrew group, surprised me with a beautiful, framed wood cutting of a locomotive which will soon be hanging in my railroad room. An unbelievably talented artist with wood (as well as a brewer who has won national awards), I have long admired Randy's artwork, and I now have an original to display. Thank you, Randy!  My model railroad friend, Brad, also stopped by. While I was gone, Brad had ""borrowed"" several of my incomplete hopper cars and returned them to me tonight as beautiful, complete models ready to earn their keep on the railroad. Making serious progress on the railroad is one of my next big projects. Thank you, Brad!  I was so pleased and humbled by the number of people who came by to welcome me home.  Josh, a new employee at the Pub, stopped by to tell me that he thru hiked the AT in 2011 and completed the PCT in 2016. I'll definitely be chatting with him in the future. We stayed late at the pub and got home after eleven o'clock. Over the objections of many, I stuck to my plan and shaved off the beard. With Becky's help (she insisted on helping) it took about thirty minutes, and I am again sporting my ""baby face."" The mop of hair goes tomorrow.  I have had numerous requests to talk about my trip to various groups, and my friends seemed pleased that I now have some new stories for them to hear.  By having my friends fill me in on the last six months of their lives, it is obvious that Tengo was spot on when we discussed the amount of change and growth that our families and friends have experienced during our absence.  Becky has her new radio program and will be performing an aerial silks routine next month. The homebrew club, with Stephen as president, is hosting our first national contest. My granddaughter, Rose, is beginning to talk and can ""go bananas"" when her mom or dad ask her to, and they will soon be moving to Copenhagen, where my son has accepted a position at the University there.  Sandy took over the entire operation of our household while I was away.  In some ways it almost seems like the world was changing and growing while I took a six-month hiatus from all of it to simply take a long walk in the woods. I do know I am glad to be home and am very excited about joining back in with family and friends on new adventures, while maintaining contact with my new Appalachian Trail friends. It seems to me we are all on journeys, and each one starts with a single step. I wish everyone reading this Happy Journeys and want to thank all of you for sharing in mine.",,View Entry,"Oct 19, Thu",0
