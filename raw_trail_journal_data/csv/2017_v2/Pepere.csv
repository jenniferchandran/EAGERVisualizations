Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502729,"In preparation for the AT hike, my wife and I spent some time in the Smoky's a couple of weeks ago. I completed seven day hikes, four along the AT and three on other trails. Prior to the hikes in the Smoky's I spent some time trying to find a partner to hike the complete Appalachian Trail. By accident, I ran into a gentleman at Clingman's Dome who provided me with information about Warren Doyle who has been hiking the trail for many years. After researching Warren's website, I decided to join the group for the 2017 expedition. I've completed the applications and plan on attending the Appalachian Trail Institute program in September.",,Appalachian Trail Preparation,"Jun 28, Sun",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503808,"I continue to search the journals for hiking gear reviews. Currently I'm wrestling with the type of electronic equipment to bring on the hike. I would like to limit the equipment to one piece such as a phone. I don't have a cell phone so I know that will be an expense. The question is what type of phone and service provider would be the best for this trip.I would want a phone that I can use to take and download pictures with, use to write journal entries, make emergency phone calls, has GPS, can interface with many of the current apps and most important is easy to use.I welcome all suggestions or advice in this area.Hope everyone's July 4th was safe and relaxing.",,Hiking Gear / Equipment Selection,"Jul 05, Sun",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505003,"I spent much of this past week and weekend researching what is being used on the trail this year.My approach was to review the gear/equipment selection and reviews from the top 50 journal entries. I then copied that information to a spreadsheet and then added the Backpacker 2015 trail tested product information to the spreadsheet.When there was a match between the journal entries and Backpacker Choice Awards, I highlighted that item. The journal entry had to have a positive review to make the list.As a result, I was able to select a couple of items for purchase this weekend. I purchased the Gregory Baltoro 75 backpack, Black Diamond Ultra Lite ""Z"" poles and the Jetboil Mini stove. I plan on testing these items out in the next couple of months.I want to thank Indigo's review on cell phone market selection. His review was right on spot.Also, the items that Hoozurmama's mentioned in her journal entry were some top contenders from other hikers and the Backpacker magazine.I plan on continuing to review the journal entries and add the information to the spreadsheet and look for items that standout from a hiker review and Backpacker magazine.I'll be concentrating on shoes and tents during this next round.Have a great week.

Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507311,"Just returned this weekend from a camping trip in Michigan. Arrived home to some gear that was delivered while I was gone.I plan on adding my gear to the journal this week but wanted to expand on Indigo's journal entry about tracking current hiker's progress. I too follow several hiker's journals to include Rock Boat, Airlock, Caboose, Trail Pilgram and several others.One hiker's journal that caught my attention was ""Lucky"". He started the hike in Georgia on February 15, 2015 and finished in Maine on July 14, 2015. He hiked through snow storms and all the other weather elements and celebrated his 73rd birthday while on the trail. Oh, and by the way he hiked the complete trail with a hernia which he was not aware of until about a month into the hike.He was able to stop to see a doctor but refused to quit the trail. He wore a support garment which enabled him to continue.Lucky just updated his journal entry with a packing list that can be printed out. He plans on listing some recommendations for future hikers in the next several weeks. I'm sure one of his recommendations will be not to hike with a hernia.Overall, most of the journal entries are very descriptive in nature allowing the reader to feel like they are part of the journey.PepereNOBO 2017",,Kudo's to Lucky,"Jul 26, Sun",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507794,"I can remember when my wife and I backpacked across the Grand Canyon and how the guide harped on reducing are backpack weight. In fact he visited us the night before our hike and began throwing stuff out of our backpack. It even came down to tearing out pages of a book that I planned on bringing for reading material.I then saw Lucky's packing list that he used to complete his Appalachian thru hike this year. He stated that ""The three most important things about back packing are: pack weight, pack weight, and pack weight.""As a result, and using this information as a lessons learned event, I'm changing my back pack from the Gregory Baltoro 75 which weighs close to 6 pounds to the ULA Catalyst which weighs 3 pounds.There were other reasons that I selected the ULA Catalyst. I reviewed the video's on their web site, customer comments and numerous journal entries pertaining to this back pack and decided that this back pack was best for me.I ordered the back pack on Monday and should have it by today.",,Change of Gear,"Jul 30, Thu",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510361,"This past weekend I decided to test out some of my equipment. I packed up my ULA Catalyst backpack and headed out to a local hiking area. I tested my backpack, boots, clothing, water bladder and headlamp for over 16.5 miles. Actually the headlamp was only used in the first 6 miles.I started at 5:15am and finished at 10:10am. I was expecting to be out for 7-8 hours but made the 16.5 miles in just under 5 hours. One thing I learned is that I need to control my speed better. I acted like it was more of a race then a hike.Overall I was very satisfied with my equipment to date.I plan on hiking another 15-20 miles later this week but at a slower pace.My plan for the rest of the year is to hike at least 15-20 miles a week until I attend the Appalachian Trail Institute orientation class on September 27th. After that I will take my first preparation hike from October 2nd thru the 5th.I plan on taking my second preparation hike in April 2016 followed immediately by hiking from Fontana Dam to Davenport Gap in the Smoky's to test out additional equipment.In the summer of 2016 I plan on hiking the Presidential range in the White Mountains and make final adjustments to my gear selections.That's all for now.Ron ScholtesTrail Name - PepereNOBO 2017",,Practice Hike #1,"Aug 17, Mon",0

Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515867,"I was successful in completing my first two objectives. The first was to attend the ATI course in Mountain City, Tennessee. I completed the ATI course the last week of September. I followed this up with attending the orientation course to participate in the 2017 Expedition.The second objective was to complete the first preparation hike for the 2017 Expedition. That was completed the first week of October.In all, I completed five hikes along the Appalachian Trail. Two of the hikes were 6-10 miles and the other three hikes were 16-23 miles. Four of the hikes were in the rain, two of them with significant rainfall.It was an excellent chance to test out my equipment in the rain and it performed flawlessly. Also, it gave me some time in getting use to hiking in the rain. Up until now, I would not hike in the rain, walk through mud or cross streams or rivers. Those days are long gone if I want to hike the Appalachian Trail.My next objective is the attend the second preparation hike in April 2016. I plan on following that hike with a hike through the Smoky Mountains during the second week of April 2016. I then plan on attending a Smart Hike in the White Mountains in August 2016.Everything is going well as planned. Ron ScholtesTrail Name: PepereNOBO 2017",,Appalchian Trail Institute,"Oct 15, Thu",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519913,"I finalized my list of preparation hikes for 2016.In April, I will hike from Bland, VA to Mt. Rogers. This will complete the section of the AT from Bland, VA to Damascus, VA. In 2015, I hiked from Damascus to Mt.Rogers.In May, I will hike the Smoky Mountain range from Fontana Dam to Davenport Gap.In June, I plan to hike the Vermont Long Trail for additional preparation.In August, I will hike from Glencliff, NH to Gorham, NH.All the planning has been completed for the Virginia, Smoky Mountain and Hew Hampshire hikes. Still working on the Vermont Long Trail preparations.I purchased my tent (A Uber Bivy) which I will test out during the above hikes.I plan on purchasing my I-Phone this week and get use to using a cell phone. Up to now I've been able to survive without a cell phone. Does that give away my age?After August I plan on doing short hikes and staying in shape until April 2017.

Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525259,"Good morning everyone,In three days I'll be doing my second preparation hike for the Appalachian Trail. I'll be hiking from Bland, VA to Mt. Rogers Center.A lot has happen in the last month. I finally received my tent and have tried it out a couple of times. I plan on using it during the upcoming hike. I believe I have all my gear now and have tested most of it during earlier hikes.I made reservations at the Amicalola Falls State Park & Lodge for next year. My wife and I will be staying there for a couple of days before I start the hike.As far as hiking the Vermont Long Trail in June, I have the schedule completed and started to make reservations at three stops that we will use for resupply points. We start the hike on June 3rd and finish on June 23rd.I'm still planning the hike along the Smokies during the last part of May.I'm off to take a morning hike and will provide an update later.Ron ScholtesTrail Name: PepereNOBO 2017",,Preparation Hike #2,"Mar 29, Tue",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528346,"What a disaster!!!! I used the same food selection that I used on the first prep hike last October which went extremely well. However, during this prep hike we either stayed in tents or slept in our cars depending on the weather when reached our destination and did not go into town. No large spaghetti dinners this time. What a difference on not having the carbs to start the next day. By mid afternoon I could barely hike up any inclines and seem to roll down the hills.As a result, on one of my falls down the hill I planted my face into the ground. My glasses cut into the top of my right eyebrow giving me a pretty nasty gash. Luckily the person hiking with me got the bleeding to stop and helped me to the end of the trail. Our group also had a retired nurse who made sure the wound was cleaned out and bandaged me up for another half day of hiking. I refused to get stiches at my age.The upside of this adventure is I ended up getting an eye exam and new glasses that were long overdue.My wife and I spent several hours in the grocery store selecting a well balanced carb and protein menu for future hikes. I learned my lesson on this one.My plans are still to hike the Smoky Mountain range in late May and then to move on to hiking the Vermont Long Trail starting on June 3rd.","Preparation Hike #2

Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534991,Had a very successful preparation hike along the Smoky Mountain range this past week. Completed several 10-15 mile hikes with a full pack @ 34lbs. Several shelters were closed due to bear activity. An Appalachian hiker camping in his tent at the Spencer Shelter had a bear bite his foot through the tent.The park rangers caught a bear in the area and euthanized it but later found out that it was not the bear that bit the hiker. They are still searching the area for the bear.The good things from the hike was that my food selection was good. I had no issues with feeling weak especially climbing the long trails up hill and falling down.Now it's on to Vermont next week to tackle the Vermont Long Trail.PepereNOBO 2017,,Preparation Hike Smoky Mountains,"May 25, Wed",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536338,"We arrived in Williamstown, Ma yesterday to start our hike along the Vermont Long Trail / Applachian Trail. The weather forecast looks favorable to start the hike. Our first section will be 13.3 miles which will take us to the Congdon Shelter.",,Vermont Long Trail / Appalachian Trail Prep Hike,"Jun 03, Fri",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537267,"Well both Dave and I started out the hike on Friday morning. We were about 4.3 miles from the shelter when we became separated. After spending time looking for each other it began to get dark so I ended up stealth camping along a creek bed and Dave made it to the Congdon Shelter. On Saturday, little did we know that both of us had a medical condition that caused us both to leave the trail.Our Vermont Long Trail hike was short lived but I did gain additional experience in hiking trails. One of the things that I learned by attending the Appalachian Trail Institute was ""DWDR"" which stands for ""Down Water, Down Road"". I mistakenly took a wrong turn on Friday evening and not realizing it until it was to late, I was off the trail. I found a creek bed and followed it down hill. I ended up camping along the creek bed for the night. The next morning I decided to continue to follow the creek bed down hill which led me to a forest access road, where I found a ride into town. By that time I noticed that my right knee began to swell and I had numbness in all my toes. I made it back to Michigan on Sunday and was able to see a specialist on Tuesday. I have some tests scheduled for Friday to check for nerve damage in my lower back. Depending what they find, I would still like to go back and hike the Long Trail. Anyway, even though the hike was short, it gave me additional experience in preparing for the Appalachian Trail hike in 2017.",,Vermont Long Trail / Appalachian Trail Prep Hike,"Jun 08, Wed",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547034,"Just finished getting all the results back from the cardiologist. All the tests came out good so no issue with the heart. The doctor gave me a clean bill of health to start hiking. I do plan on changing how I carry my water. Up to now I've always used a water bladder but realized the difficulty in judging how much water I was really drinking. I was always in the conservation mode.On the Vermont hike I used less then a litre of water when Dave used 3 litre's before our first fill up. I thought I was staying hydrated but not so. Also, there's the problem of trying to stuff the water bladder back into a full backpack after refilling. I'm switching over to carrying water bottles to better gage the amount of water intake.I plan on doing several hikes at Bald Mountain (Central Michigan) in the next several weeks. My next prep hike will be in Pennsylvania the end of September.PepereNOBO 2017",,All Clear To Hike,"Aug 27, Sat",0
Pepere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578158,"First I want to congratulate all the 2017 hikers that have finished their quest and cheer on those hikers still continuing to hike. 
My original plan was to hike the trail this year but two events occurred that changed those plans.  First my wife suffered a massive stroke in January.  The good news is that we were able to recognize the condition immediately and get her to the emergency room where they started the procedure to reduce the blood clot.  They administered the drug TPA within the allotted time frame and removed the blood clot within several hours of being admitted.  Miraculously she fully recovered after the second day in the hospital.  I never saw doctors and nurses so happy that they were crying and dancing after she recovered.  They said that it is very rare for a person to recover this quickly but she had so many good factors in her favor.
The second event was that I injured my right knee several times during practice hikes that it was necessary to have a complete knee replacement surgery in April.  Because of these two events I was not able to hike this year.  I'm almost back to 100% after the surgery and have made the decision to plan my hike for 2018.  I'll be transferring my information to the 2018 page later this month.  
My plan right now is to start hiking around March 10th in Virginia and hike North for about 45 days and then travel back down to Springer and hike North to where I started.  This way I avoid the crowds at Springer and the colder weather in the Smokies.  I will then travel back to the trail where I left off and continue to Maine.  I plan on finishing in late August 2018.
