I must be crazy but I guess everyone who tries to walk over 2000 miles needs to be somewhat insane.   In 2015, I was attempting a Thru and broke my leg at MM 313. In 2016, I started again at Springer but figured out after 2.5 days that my leg and ankle were not healed enough to complete a Thru hike. The first day out took me forever to get to the shelter and on top of that I was so nervous about falling! I have never had that scared feeling about being out there hiking alone. So I made the quick decision to get off the trail at a place that would be easy to get back to the airport and get a flight home. So from then until now I've worked hard at trying to get my leg and ankle back to Trail form. It is certainly a lot stronger this year than last year and I've been trying to increase my hiking speed. I'm still slow compared to most other Thrus, but I get to where I need to be by the end of the day. I did a few backpacking trips this past year. I completed all the 113 miles of the AT that the RATC (Roanoke Appalachian Trail Club ) is responsible for maintaining. Last year I joined the McAfee Knob Task force which involves hiking up to McAfee's Knob and Dragon's Tooth at least once each month. I had already adopted Fullhart Shelter in 2014, so that's another every month or so hike. In August I hiked from Manchester Center, Vermont to Hanover, NH. Since my thru in 07' I've been section hiking with friends and we have completed, in sections going north, up to the border of NH. A few more years and we will finish that journey also. But the desire to complete a Thru hike is ever present in my mind. I thru hiked in 07 but had to get off 200 miles short. So even though I went back as soon as my fractured toes would allow and completed the Trail, I felt unaccomplished. I know that's crazy and I may not make this whole journey this time, but I need to give it one more try!And that's correct, I'm planning on leaving mid February! Crazy! Stupid! All of those thoughts ran through my head like a train about to go off its track. But I want to be ahead of the bubble, and I want to be able to slow down and take a few more zero days. When I started in March of 2015 the hikers overran the shelters. I'm a fairly slow hiker, and I understand the bubble will catch me, but I'd like to be further along when they do and the group will thin out the further north I go. Last year I acquired a few extra items to help deal with the cold so I know I'll prepared for the weather in February and March. I have a down hood, a new Thermorest neo-air, the one that has a higher R value, micro spikes, tall gaiters, and a Delorme (satellite locator device (having to be rescued off the trail makes you a little nervous about being out there alone). I'm taking different gloves and over mitts that I hope will work in the cold rain and of course a lot of hand warmers. But I know I will still be cold at times especially when I get out of my sleeping bag. So as I once again start this journey, wish me luck and I hope to see many of you on the Trail! A new beginningComes along with renewed hope.The Trail awaits me!",,Again?,"Jan 08, Sun",0
Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553952,"Except for a few things that were on my 2007 hike, I have updated all of my equipment over the past 10 years. My backpack is now an Osprey XO's 58, but in 2015 I lost so much weight the first month the belt didn't fit me. Last year I had the belt fixed so it's tighter and I'm also going to try and eat more. But overall the pack works well and I love the weight of it. My air mattress, the NeoAir XTherm Sleeping Pad will be good for the cold weather at the beginning, but then I'll switch to my 3/4 NeoAir light after the weather warms up. For those of you who use them, you know that they're noisy but it beats having your hip bones pressing into the ground. I've probably used every water treatment system out there. I started out with pills, but didn't like putting chemicals into my body, then a filter pump, next a Steri pen, and now I'm using the all popular Sawyer squeeze. I'm using the lager one as the flow is faster. This one is easy, light and if it goes bad you just buy a new one. I have an adapter so I can pump it right into my bladder. I do carry some pills for emergencies and know I'll need to be careful with the Sawyer in the cold. I guess it will become my new sleeping partner! Over the last years, I've purchased two new Western Mountaineer sleeping bags. My winter bag is a 10 degree and my summer is a 35 degree. Both are light and I'm hoping the 10 degree will get me through mid February to April. I also have a silk liner. I will change out bags when I get to my house in VA , and then have it mailed back to me when I get up north. I had been using a Big Agnes Fly Creek SL one tent for the last 7 years, but I have now switched to the B A Cooper SL one. The main difference between the two is the entry way. I really like the fact I can get in it through the side and it has a lot more head room inside as well. It weighs a few more ounces but I really like the fact that it's completely free standing. I have a Montbell down sweater and Montbell down vest. Together they weigh around 7oz so I thought having both would be more versatile, and I just got a Montbell wind shirt weighing in at 1.4 ounces! I've worn it a lot on training and section hikes and it really works well under my light fleece jacket. And of course I have new shirts, pants, socks etc. I belong to a running program sponsored by FleetFeet of Roanoke, Virginia. They sell wonderful clothes and shoes for running but also for hiking. I now hike in Sacony pant and Capirs. I also have merino wool Icebreaker zip and shirt that they gave me to hike in, so I'm going to wear them up the trail. Thanks Fleet Feet, you are wonderful!Boots or shoes are not something I enjoy buying. I have bad feet, (maybe too much hiking) so I have many pairs of boots/shoes. I have tried all different kinds of boots and trail runners. I really like the Hoka running and trail runners and last year they just came out with a Hoka water proof hiking boots. Im going to start with the boots and switch to the Hoka trail runners as soon as I possibly can. And of course gloves, buffs, and all the necessary cold weather head gear. I'll use the same kind of cooking system I've used for years, the simple Pepsi can stove using denatured alcohol. But when I registered for my thru hike I read where they have banned alcohol stoves in the Smoky's. I've purchased a canister stove and will have it mailed to me when I stay at the Hike Inn just before I enter the Park. I have Black Diamond poles, a Gortex North Face rain jacket and Lightheart rain pants, and high gators ( and Dirty Girls) to start with. I think I'm pretty well outfitted for this adventure, but I find I continuously change and update my gear. Leaving in mid-February is scary for me but if I go slow and get off the Trail when I need to, I'm hoping to get ahead of the crowds!

Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554463,"And now for a little more info about who I am. I retired from teaching in 07 so I could Thru hike the AT. That year I completed all of the Trail except the last 200 miles, because of a few broken toe joints. It was very traumatic for me to have to stop that close to the end, but I did go back and finish it as soon as I could hike again. Since then, I've section hiked with a group of wonderful women. We have made it from Springer to the New Hampshire border since 2008 and will someday finish section hiking the trail together. I looked forward to those section hikes each year, to renew my friendships, and my love of nature. When you section hike, you actually learn a lot more about the AT and its surrounding area because of all the planning and shuttles you have to secure. You also get to stay in many small towns, hostels, motels, and B&B's you don't when you are Thru hiking. But the longing to be out there, to Thru hike, has increased to the point of obsession again! On one of my section hikes, I met someone I hiked with in 07 and he said to me, ""Well, you know that the trail ruins you!"" It gets into your blood and you just have to be out there among the white blazes. As I have said, I live near the Trail. I moved to Southwest VA many years ago from flat Long Island. I immediately fell in love with the mountains. I went from feeling like I to have my toes in the ocean to needing to have my feet in boots on a path. It started with day hiking but progressed to backpacking, and after I went on a weekend hike with my two sons, I caught ""white blaze fever.""And my running ""family"" has become a very important part of my life. As I've mentioned Fleet Feet Sports is a local store in the area and has various programs for walkers and runners. I started participating in their running programs years ago and worked up to the marathon group and even became a mentor for the 11-12 pace group. After my broken leg I went back to the beginning but have since gotten back to the 1/2 marathon bracket. Between the hiking I've done and running at least three times a week, I think I'm ready to try this adventure again. I'm sure if you follow me up the Trail, you might learn more about me as a person than you want to know ??Walk to a shelter Set up your camp for the night Rest your weary bones",,A little about me!,"Feb 11, Sat",0
Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554464,"They say you pack your fears. My biggest fear is being cold. Because I am leaving February 17, I know I'm going to hit some very cold and possibly snowy weather. This year, I have added more cold weather gear to my pack. I have packed micro spikes, hand warmers, three pairs of gloves, a pair of extra socks, a wool buff, hat, and headband. I have a lot of down but I know, if I have it on, and get into my 10° sleeping bag, I will be warm. One of my biggest complaints of last year was that I had cold feet at night. So this year, I purchased down booties! Last year my feet would stay warm, if I wrapped them in my down jacket, but then I didn't have my down jacket to wear. In 2015, a friend I hiked with, had a down hood and when he'd climb in his bag wearing that hood, I would be jealous. And another hiker had down pants, and he said they were his favorite piece of gear. So there you have my reasons for acquiring all that down. The combined weight is 14 oz and I can get rid of it and the added winter gear as the weather warms up. I don't really have the fear of running out of food, but I did lose a lot of weight in 2015, so I do plan on trying to eat more! Also I need to try and drink more this year. I'm going to try to camel up in the morning and when I get to a water source, drink, and carry less water on my back, especially in the south. After breaking my leg in 2015, one of my biggest fears is falling. But, I don't really know how to deal with that except maybe to slow down. This year I'm taking more zeros, and I'm not going to worry about getting to camp or making the miles, and I'm going to really hike my own hike.And now for my NOT fears. I'm not afraid of how hard the trail is going to be; I've done it, it's hard. I'm not afraid of animals; they're out there and you have to be careful. I'm not afraid of being alone; it's a lonely trek and it takes a long time to hike over 2000 miles. I'm not not afraid of pain, as long as the pain moves around. I'm not afraid of hiking in the rain; it's the AT, it's going to rain a lot. I'm not afraid of getting to the top of that mountain, which ever mountain it happens to be; if I put one foot in front of the other and just don't stop, I will eventually get to the top, no matter how long it takes. We all know that the trail is a metaphor for life: so if I work hard, put myself out there, face my fears, put one foot in front of the other, don't judge other hikers, I will make it: as long as I don't get seriously injured. Oh and keep enjoying myself most days!!!!With only days to go, my stomach is doing its own flip-flop hike. One day, I'm great and I can't wait. The next day, I am scared to death to start this adventure again. But, it is going to happen one way or the other. My list is getting checked off, my pack has been packed and unpacked, and I'm boarding that plane shortly!To everyone out there, I can't wait to meet you. I can't wait to begin my stories of 2017!And for those that are reading my journal and following along on my adventure, I want to thank you. And thanks for writing, encouraging me, and inspiring me!

To get anywhere from Roanoke you must go through Charlotte and both flights were delayed about an hour. But I finally made it to Atlanta and on the MARTA to be picked up by the Hiker Hostel. I'll be glad tomorrow when I only have to follow the white blazes!!Josh and Pootz (I hiked with him some in 07 and his wife M&M) arrived shortly after noon. They are working at the hostel for awhile. We made a stop at Wendy's for lunch and I was settled into my bunk by 2:00 PM. Two other hikers are here. Tyler is in my bunk room and Take My Time is upstairs. Both of them have already started, but are taking a rest break here. I spent the afternoon trying to fit all my ""stuff "" back in my pack. I know I had it in there once! So the rest of the day, I just hung around, not doing much of anything, except enjoying the company of hikers and resting. I guess I'm ready and it doesn't really matter as tomorrow I step back on the AT!The weather looks good for tomorrow and that is a plus.

Breakfast was at 8:00 and delicious. There were 8 of us there for breakfast but I was the only one going to Springer. All of the others were back to Woody Gap as they had already done 3 or 4 days. Pootz drove us and dropped off all the boys and he drove me up to Big Stamp Gap. You have to walk a mile south before you actually get to Springer Mtn, the actual start of the trail. Pootz decided to walk the mile in with me so it meant I could slack pack. We took pictures, hiked back, I picked up my pack and off I went. It was a beautiful day. I took my time and just enjoyed the day. I took a break at Stover Creek Shelter and changed into my capris and a short sleeve shirt. It is February correct!   There was another thru hiker there, Hickory who apparently walked south a few miles today by mistake. That would not be fun. There was a section where I didn't see a white blaze for awhile. I know I shouldn't panic but as you walk along you imagine all sorts of things. Did I miss a turn off? I was on a logging road and often the trail does shoot off sharply, but finally I saw one and breathed a sigh of relief. When I'm alone I tend to panic more. But now I have that Guthook app and that helps a lot. I took a few more short breaks and arrived at Hawk Mtn Shelter around 3:20. And I felt good! There was only one young man there, Bearspray. He squirted his bearspray inside the Hiker Hostel and they had to move everyone out of that room. I knew there was 6 or 7 guys behind me but they were taking longer breaks than I was. I put my stuff out in the shelter and the others started to arrive. So here tonight are Hickory, Bearspray , Tru Grit, Treeline , (a father and daughter) Air Force, and a few more that I didn't know. It was a nice group and a warm night and we were all in our bags by dark.  Hiking the ATDeepens your soul forever Changing you inside.","Springer Mtn

It was 9:00 before I was on the trail. It was cool but not too bad. I moved right along to High Tower Gap and the rest of the day kind of went downhill from there. The rain stated and never stopped for the rest of the day. I put my wind shirt and a pair of gloves on and just hiked kept going. I actually caught up to the section hiker I've been calling Air Force three or four times. I kept watching all day for the rest of the hikers to come up behind me but the never did. Because of the rain I only took standing breaks all day. I felt very pleased as I hiked up Sassafras Mtn and Justus Mtn with out stopping. A lot different than last year when I could only go 100 steps without taking a break. I arrived at Gooch Gap Shelter at 1:20. Most of the others came in within the hour. I was going to go on and camp with some of them, but decided against it. I was finally warm and dry after changing into dry clothes and having hot chocolate. It was the best decision as it rained into the night. Others came in to stay and a Boy Scout Troop arrived but luckily they camped. It turned out to be a very pleasant evening talking to each hiker as they arrived. Whistler, an older gentleman, a young man who has a bear canisters, and then after dark 3 southbound section hikers kept us entertained for the night.

I had slept much better last night. The cold rain continued well into the night but had stopped by morning. The wind had picked up though, so the day was cool and foggy. I moved along well this morning and I was at Woody Gap around 11:00. Perfect time for a break as there is a bathroom and picnic tables at the parking lot, but the cold wind had a different plan. I used the restroom, took an orange someone had left for hikers, and hurried up the hill to get warm. It didn't take long as I was soon climbing up to Preaching Rock. I thought it was appropriate for a Sunday morning. There were lots of day hikers on the trail today. At the top I met Giggles and his son Chris. Giggles has a Trail Journal also. We hiked on and off together for the rest of the day. I also started calling the Hiker with my bear canister Bear, as I couldn't remember his name. When I got to Lance Creek, I had to stop for water as there was not going to be any more water for the next four miles or at the shelter. One of my least favorite things is to have to carry water as it adds so much weight to your pack. But at the creek, we had a small reunion. Giggles, Chris, Bear and myself were all there and from up trail I hear Signage! It was the two young hikers from Hawk who had left Gooch in the rain. They had gone to a hotel and were slack packing already! But HYOH, so we caught up on who was where and off the went. As for myself, I sort of trudged on the last four miles as my pack was heavy and the sides of my toes started to blister. But the weather had turned sunny and warm so I tried to just enjoy the day. I was glad to see the shelter sign for Woods Hole. It is .4 miles off the trail. It was a beautiful night with a gorgeous sunset. Here tonight are two brothers from North Dakota who I've dubbed one North and the other Dakota, Giggles, Chris, and Bear. A very nice group and we just talked over dinner and went to bed.

It overwhelmed me with just how small I am and also who might be out there watching us!! The day was warm and sunny and the climb up was not too difficult. My only problem was that my toe blisters were making me very uncomfortable. Our small band of hikers took a long break up top in the warm sunshine before heading down the mountain to the hostel. We all checked in, picked our bunks, took showers, and walked down to the Country Store for pizza. It was a very pleasant day. I purchased a pair of new Oboz boots as my feet were killing me by the bottom of the mountain. I figured they couldn't be any worse. We will see how they do tomorrow on a long day. I mailed my others home as they are still good boots as long as I don't have 30 lbs on my back.

It was very pleasant. Giggles and I left together around 7:00. I was glad, as I was meeting Winkle (I got to know her when I hiked in 07 and she would write to me on Trail Journals). She was going to hike in from Tesnatee Gap to meet me and then back. On the up the hill from Neel Gap, I passed a few tents and then a gentleman from Scotland, William. He is an older man with quite an accent. I hope his name becomes Scotty as then I will be able to remember it. Bear soon came up behind me and said he might go all the way to Blue Mtn Shelter. Then I met up with Chris and we were talking and all of a sudden Dakota and North came up to tell him his dad Giggles was going back to Neel Gap. He was stopping. I felt bad for him as I know how it feels to make that decision. My new boots were working well. I did need to stop and put my liners on, but after that they felt fine. After a few hours of hiking I saw Winkle hiking toward me. It was really good to see her and we hiked back to the gap together. The wind was blowing and it was cold so we sat in her car and I ate the cookies she had made me. It was wonderful. Then she hike up and over Wildcat Mtn. We stopped at the top for lunch. At Hogpen Gap we met Just Lenord. He was giving out some trail magic. I took a small Gatorade, said goodbye to Winkle and off I went. I went up and over White Oak Stamp, Poor Mtn, and finally Sheep Rock Top and then down to Low Gap Shelter. I was pleasantly surprised that Bear, North, and Dakota were there. I joined them in the shelter as they were predicting rain. A little while later other hikers started to arrive. I think there is probably 10 or so others here tonight. There was room in the shelter but no one joined us. Tripping (I met her on Springer Mtn going down with her children), Doc, and a few more came to sit at the table to eat.

I was soooo glad I was in a shelter. We all were slow moving as we were waiting for it to get a little clearer. It still sounded as if it was raining but it was just the fog dripping from the trees. It was deceiving. Dakota, North, and Bear all left before me and that maybe the last time I see them as they were all going to Tray Mtn Shelter. The rest of the hikers were going to the Cheese Factory campsite. I was just going to Blue Mtn Shelter 7.3 miles away. It was really a great day for me as I took many breaks along the way, enjoyed walking in the fog, and felt as if I was the only person out in the woods. The trail was fairly easy but I felt tired. I stopped at one point and made reservations at Top of Georgia as everyone last night was talking about going and taking zero there. And because I made the reservation, I got to request a bottom bunk. Later on the trail became very rocky and I really had to slow down and watch my steps. The water source was .7 miles from the shelter. Did I say I HATE to carry water. It adds about 8 lbs to your already heavy pack. But you must have water to cook and for the next day. I walked into the empty shelter about 2:30 and took my time setting up my tent. This will be my first time in my tent but I figured with no one here, it would be the better option and it is not supposed to rain. I boiled water, made hot chocolate and had a peanut butter tortilla. The wind had died down and the sun was trying hard to come out!Trinity and Ben arrived at 5:00 PM. I was prepared to stay alone but was glad to see someone else get here. A security blanket! They set up tents and then we ate dinner together. They are from Pennsylvania and hiking to the halfway point. That is one long section. We call them LASHERS. Long ---- section hikers. Later on two brothers came in. One set up in the shelter and set up a hammock. I won't see them again as they are already doing 18 mile days. It was a beautiful sunset and it's probably the coolest night so far.

As I walked down the mountain she drove in. She was bringing me the Velcro pieces to hook my Dirty Girl gators to the back of my boots. She also had a bag of tangerines. I ate two and as we were talking the boys from last night came down and they ate some. Then a pickup truck pulled in and out jumped the North Dakota boys.I said goodbye to Winkle and started up Rocky Mountain. It was a tuff climb.

But everything was as wet as if it had rained. I packed up almost everything inside my tent and put the rest in quickly. I was walking about 7:30 but it was slow going as I didn't feel well. My stomach was hurting and a little nauseous. I stopped and took the first of many long breaks of the day. After I ate something, I did feel better. The hiking was fairly easy until Addis Gap and then you have to climb Kelly Knob. I thought it would take me an hour but I was pleased to be up in 45 min. I took my last of 5 breaks on top of Powell Mtn before heading down in Dicks Creek Gap. I also put my ankle brace on for the first time on the hike. That is one hard long down and I was so pleased because as I walked out of the woods the Top of Georgia Hiker Hostel van pulled into the parking lot saving me a half mile road walk.

I've never taken a zero so early in a hike but I so enjoyed today. I woke up to rain and thought ""really good decision "" but the rain stopped and the sun came out and as I watched the people I've been hiking with leave I was not so sure. But I had breakfast, updated my journal, talked a lot to Bob ( Sir Packs A Lot), the owner and the staff, went to town to re supply, and took another shower. All in all a good day. I called and made a reservation at Nantahala Mtn Lodge. I stayed there in 2015 and really enjoyed it so instead of going into Franklin, I'll go there for two days and slack pack one. Tarzan stayed also (I met him at Hawk day 1) and we went to town together and got Zackby chicken and brought it back to eat. We talked a lot and I got to know him better. Tonight in my bunk room is a young man just out of high school who has already joined the Coast Guard but has to wait October to actually go in. His trail name is a Cruz Control. The person over me is Naked Savage from Cape Cod. And then there is a whole other group who are hiking together. I can't remember their names but they seem to be having fun. It was a good day and my body and my feet certainly feel better tonight. Tomorrow I'm back on the trail. But I'm glad I'm here as they are predicting temperatures in the 20s. I hope this beautiful weather is not over. Zero days are good For resting and relaxing.The body says thanks!","Dicks Creek Gap

A few of us were getting ready in the hall by the night light. I had breakfast, said goodbye to Sir Packs A Lot and his crew, and climbed aboard the van. Almost all the other hikers were waiting until 9:00. It's a pretty big climb out of Dicks Creek Gap so even though it was cold, I had to stop and take off clothes. I met a few different section hiking groups that were coming out of Plumorchard Shelter. They had been out for the weekend and they said they froze last night. It was a great night to be in a hostel. After Plumorchard, the 9:00 am shuttle hikers started passing me. I was taking a break and Tarzan walked up. He sat down and we talked for a while. Then we walked together but he is so much faster that he eventually had to pull away. After Rocky Knob, I walked down to the GA/NC border!! One state done, 13 to go! Tarzan was waiting for me to cross the border. Sweet. We took some pictures and then had a big climb out of Bly Gap. It seemed to go on forever. As I approached the top, I met Take My Time standing on a rock taking pictures. Tarzan had still not caught up. Take and I walked together until the shelter. We arrived at Muskrat Creek Shelter and I got a spot in it. It was going to be another cold night. Tarzan built a good fire and the whole group joined us. There were at least 12 hikers sitting around the campfire. I soon settled in the night. Crossing a state lineBrings a feeling of wonderAs you walk closer!","Dicks Creek Gap

I was the first one out this morning but it doesn't take long for everyone to pass me by. It was the first morning when I've left camp that we didn't go uphill. For about 2 miles I just moseyed along. I was coming down into Deep Gap when Naked Savage passed by me running down the rocks. I told him he was going to pay for that in the long run. When I arrived at the bottom, we started talking and walking together. After about 15 min, I noticed we were going down and I hadn't seen a white blaze for awhile. I checked my Guthook app and of course, we were not on the trail. We lost about 30 minutes of hiking time on a already long day. We finally started up Standing Indian Mtn and I took a lunch break at the Shelter. This whole mountain had been on fire and the devastation is very evident. It's heartbreaking and it was very eerie to be walking through it. All the trees are black and the trail is in poor shape. The big group of hikers I've been with the last few days caught up and past me and we all commented on the weird feeling we had walking through the dead forest. As I was hiking down, I could see weather coming in and the temperature was falling quickly. Before I knew it the snow started and I stopped to gear up. But luckily it didn't last long and was just cloudy for the rest of the day. I made it to Carter Gap Shelter and Naked Savage was nice enough to give me his spot in the shelter and had gotten enough water so I didn't have to do the long trek down to the stream. I think he felt awful about missing the trail in the morning. I put my stuff out next to Hat, who I'd not met before, and made dinner quickly to get some warm food in my belly. The big group started a fire away from the shelter but I didn't feel like joining them. It was almost dark when Tarzan and Take My Time came into camp. I was already in my bag so I just talked to them for a short time and then snuggled down to keep warm and go to sleep.

At Betty Creek Gap I changed into cooler clothes and took a break. It's a good spot to stop as it has a great log to sit on. Two young hikers past me and said a big storm was approaching and getting to us around 1:00. That put the fire under me, as I had to climb Albert Mtn (a rock scramble) and did not want to do it in the rain. I made it by noon and up I went. So for those who don't know me I'm a pretty small person and any rock scramble is a challenge for me. I have to figure out how to get up areas I just can't reach. It's not a pretty sight as I throw my hiking sticks ahead of me and many times have to get on my knees and push myself up to the next level. It would be so much easier without the 30 lbs weight on my back. But I did make it up to the top. There's a fire tower at the top, but I've been up it a few times before, and decided I'd rather put the time in on the trail with the storm now gathering around me. I headed down to Long Branch Shelter, but at 1:00 it was still not raining, so just kept going. Around 2:15 at the top of a hill I felt the first sprinkle. Generally I'll walk awhile before getting suited up but I knew this was going to be a whopper of a storm. I put all my rain gear on (first time for rain pants). Of course it just sprinkled for another 20 minutes but then the lighting, thunder, fierce winds, and torrential rain hit all at once. I then just slowed down and was careful with my footing. A group of four of the young hikers passed me completely soaked with no rain gear on as they had waited too long. One was hiking in jeans and a cotton sweatshirt!!! A recipe for hyperthermia. After 2 miles, I arrived at the shelter and was actually pretty dry. Thank you Gor-Tex. Those four hikers were all in the shelter and the roof was leaking so only half was usable. They all decided to catch a shuttle into town and I settled down on the dry half. Two more of their group arrived and they went on as well. Naked Savage (the last of their group) came hobbling in (running down the trail had caught up with him) and he stayed and set up next to me. Meanwhile the rain continued to come down in torrents. Then Trinity and Ben arrived and the boys first tried to fix the roof, then rigged up a system to divert the water using their tent footprints and it worked. We all cooked and ate inside and crawled into our bags. I didn't even brush my teeth. The rain and wind was so hard it was coming in about a foot inside the shelter. We all talked for awhile then grew quite and tried to sleep. It was a big day!Being chased by a Thunderstorm makes one crazyCringing from the sound","Carter Gap Shelter

Naked Savage was the first one out this morning, then I left. There was a trash can at Rock Gap. It's always a nice surprise when you find one as sometimes your trash weighs more than your food. At Wallace Gap, I called to confirm my stay at the Nantahala Lodge. I was looking forward to seeing Wiggy and Maggie again. If you don't need to go into Franklin and want an upscale hostel, this is the place. The wind blew so hard at times it almost knocked me over. I hiked the four miles to Winding Stair Gap and found Naked Savage, Trinity, and Ben all still there. Trinity and Ben were hitching as they needed to go into Franklin to see if she could get new boots. As I walked up, a truck pulled in to pick them up. I scurried across the busy highway and back up into the woods. The trail then goes up for over four miles. Two trail maintainers came up behind me and we chatted for awhile. I told them about the leaky roof at the last shelter. They asked me if I had seen any Trail Ambassadors and I said no. Then they told me a bad storm was expected around noon so I hurried on. Around 1:00 I felt the first drops, so once again I got suited up for bad weather. It did rain but not too badly. I reached Siler Bald around 2:30 and called the Nantahala Lodge. They said they would meet me at Wayah Gap in about an hour so I went down as quickly and carefully as I could. After waiting just a few minutes Wiggie pulled up and as soon as we got my gear and me in the car the torrential rain started up. It poured all the way to the hostel. I took a shower and they got a phone call to pick up Trinity and Ben. The lights kept flicking on and off. I was very glad to be there. Maggie fixed the three of us a wonderful dinner with a salad and dessert. The three of us sat around until almost 10:00 pm talking. That's almost unheard of in the Hiker world. A good way to end a day. Good food and good friends Makes the hard miles seem better Cherish those moments!","Rock Gap Shelter

After a great breakfast cooked by Maggie, we loaded up and Wiggy drove Trinity, Ben, and I back to Wayah Gap. I was slack packing today. That's when you just carry the essentials for the day. It was really nice not to put that small child on your back and walk for miles. It was a cold but sunny day and I went up to Wayah Bald. Even with full packs, Ben and Trinity soon past me by. I'm really struggling on the up hills. I reached the Bald and the devastation was awful. There is a beautiful stone tower up there and although the tower is still there, the roof is completely gone. Everything is pitch black and all the beautiful rhododendrons are dead. I didn't stay long as I had a lot of miles to put in. With a light pack I just kept walking all day. There was actually some flat areas today and when I reached Burningtown Gap there was a couple set up with trail magic. About 6 hikers were standing around partaking and enjoying the sun. I grabbed a Gatorade, a donut, thanked them and kept going. I didn't even stop to eat the lunch Maggie packet me until Cold Spring Shelter. There was no one there, so I took a short break and again moved on with still over 3 miles to go. I hiked to Rocky Bald and called to tell Wiggy where I was, so they knew when to pick me up. It's a really long hard down and I was glad to arrive at Tellico Gap around 4:30. No one was there so I sat down to wait. Soon Trinity and Ben came down the trail and were going on to Wesser Bald Shelter. That would be a 15 mile day for them. I was glad to be going back to the hostel. Soon Wiggy drove up and we were on our way. I had another shower, a great dinner, and I was totally alone in the house. It was superb.

I ate 3 pancakes, fried eggs, and tater tots and hot tea. Since I was the only one there, Maggie fixed my breakfast early and I had packed up last night, so I was on the Trail by 8:30. It was cool and windy but a beautiful day and I was determined to enjoy it. I started up to Wesser Bald and then climbed the observation tower. The grandeur of the panoramic view was incredible. I stood in the morning sunshine and soaked it all in. After a while, King James and his service dog came up the stairs. We talked for awhile and then I moved on down the way, but once again I was walking through a fire burned forest. There were many small potato hills (ups and downs) until the Trail started down for good. At the Jumpoff Rock, the trail goes straight down. I then had to sit down and slide down those rocks. My legs are sometimes just too short for this trail. I scrapped my leg and know I'll have a bruise tomorrow. I continued down and the trail was so badly damaged in places it slowed me to a crawl. There's one place when I looked down there was no trail. I had to hang onto the rocks and make sure my foot was on solid ground before lifting the other foot. I was glad to get down to better trail at the bottom. I texted Trinity and Ben as I walked across the road to the NOC and they were in the restaurant. We then all walked up to register. They had gotten a room in a cabin, not the Hiker Hostel, so I splurged and did the same. I was so glad I did. In 2015 I was on a plastic mattress with port a johns outside. This time I had a beautiful room with my own bathroom and shower. I dropped my stuff, went to re supply, then took a long hot shower. Trinity, Ben, and I went to the restaurant for dinner. On the way there, I saw the North Dakota bothers. I was very glad to see them. It's amazing how much you feel like family out here in the woods. I had my first glass of wine since I started and a large hamburger. Trinity ordered a dessert and the three of us shared it. We went back to our rooms and I packed up and went to bed. Another night alone and I have to admit it felt good. Trinity is leaving in the morning, renting a car and driving home to PA then to Ohio for a medical school interview.

I got up at 6:00 and was on the trail at 7:00. Like yesterday's climb down, today's was just as hard getting out of the Gap. It's pretty much up for 5 miles. It has a few breaks here and there but it's mostly up. But it was a sunny day and I just kept going. I feel like everyone else is speeding up but I'm slowing down. I finally took a break after I passed Swim Bald and I had reached the top. I ate lunch and that apple I've been carrying for days. It was delicious. I then walked the mile to Sassafras Shelter to load up on water. Ben and I were planning on going a few more miles passed the shelter so tomorrow wouldn't be so long. I wasn't sure about water at the campsite so I thought I'd get some extra. Ben caught up to me shortly after I left the shelter. We took a long break up at Cheoah Bald. It is so beautiful up there. In 2015 I spent the night here. But we soon moved on as we had 2.4 more miles to go. I eventually got there, but the ankle on the leg I broke in 2015 felt like it was on fire. It has been bothering me more each day. I think that's why I'm going slower. Ben and I set up camp behind a clump of trees. He threw a bear line and we ate dinner. Soon some other hikers arrived and they built a fire. The smoke rolled downhill right into my tent. It bothered me most of the night and I worried that they hadn't put the fire out.

I was glad when it was time to get up. I was on the Trail about 7:15. It was a chilly but sunny day and soon I had to stop and take clothes off. It was a very long down into Stecoah Gap but then what goes down must then go up. And an ugly up it was. It is called Jacob's Ladder and each ""rung"" gets steeper until you feel like the trail is inches from your nose. But I finally made it to Brown Fork Gap Shelter and took a break on a log down from the shelter to eat. As I was sitting there, a hiker came along and sat down. He was there for awhile but the only thing he said to me was ""When did you start?"" I told him February 17 he said the 24th and that was the entire conversation. Pretty strange, I thought. But then North showed up and we caught up on each other's happenings. His brother had gone home. I still had 6 miles to go so I left first. Mr. Personality passed me and by the time I reached the top of Brushnell Knob, North caught up to me and we enjoyed the beautiful view together. I made it to Cable Gap Shelter around 4:30 pm and only North was in the shelter and as it was going to rain, I decided to bunk in tonight. I'd never stayed in this shelter. It's very small. Thor arrived and he also decided to stay in it. The rest of his crew came down the mountain one at a time but they all choose to camp down the hill. I was glad as they are very loud at night.

Both North and Thor were up and out before me, but I soon followed. And of course the trail headed up. But when I got to the top there was a great view of Fontana Lake. Even in the gray morning mist the lake below looked stunning. There were many small potato hills again and I was feeling pretty sluggish. My ankle was hurting and my broken leg was bothering me. The down hill was the worst, because of the rain and wet rocks it was treacherous and I had to watch every step. Add to that I'm afraid of falling again and it makes for a slow trek to the bottom. But I finally made it to the marine boat area. You need to call the Hike Inn from there but of course the phone was out of order. I panicked a little, but read a sign that if you had Verizon, you could call from the Fontana Shelter a few miles north. A few years ago they re-routed the trail so now you walk along the edge of the lake. I was nervous about not being able to get in touch with Nancy (the woman who runs the Hike Inn) so every time I got to the top of a hill I tried to call her. And the third time I got through. Then I had 30 min to get to the pick up spot. As I walked by the shelter I waved to North. I was at the parking lot waiting and he walked up and we talked some more. Then Nancy arrived and I was whisked away to my own room and hot shower. The Hike Inn is just a very small motel of 5 rooms. I was in room 5. It was nice to again have my own room and especially nice to have my own bathroom. I took a shower, dried every thing out and wrote in my journal. After a lot of thought, and a few days of hiking in a lot of pain, I've decided to end my hike here at mile 166. I'm safe and warm and can get picked up easily by a friend tomorrow. It's been another great journey, but my broken leg/ankle is just not up to the strenuous daily grind of a Thru hiking. I will go back to section hiking and enjoy every moment I have in the woods. Thank you all for joining me on my journey even if it didn't turn out like any of us wanted and maybe I'll see some of you up the Trail someday!
