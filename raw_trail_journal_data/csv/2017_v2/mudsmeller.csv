mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554618,A few years back I bought an Osprey Aura 65. I LOVE this pack however at 6+ pounds I know I need to switch it out. Currently looking at the Osprey Exos or the REI Flash. Also bought the Cat's Meow Woman's sleeping bag. I switched that out for an Enlightened Equipment Quilt. Switched out the MRS pump water filter for the PureFilter Water Purification systems. More research to be done and feeling the time squeeze!,,AT Prep,"Feb 14, Tue",0
mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554632,Also on the list of preparations is of course physical conditioning. Are you familiar with PRP injections? Well I had both knees injected last summer/fall and working on strengthening them since then. Walking up to 10 miles easily now.However the terrain is pretty flat here.

mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554887,"Yesterday I did my first 14 mile hike on a pretty well groomed trail (not pavement). 2 weeks ago I did a 7, a 4 and a 10 mile. This past week i did an 8, a 4, and yesterday's 14. The trail itself had hardly any elevation change but lots of roots and step overs. The forward motion feels great and by mile 12 my feet were feeling the steps. Still with 2 months of training to go I will fill in with elevation and pack weight. I have been trying out the ProTec wraps for my knees. After lots of different trials with and without them it looks like they will be something my knees will benefit from. I first heard of them from Neemor's World You Tube post AT video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuUpg6ngVIgToday my body is tender but not sore Gonna do a bit of yoga today to stretch and open up those joints. not sure what the rest of the week will look like yet.",,14 mile prep hike,"Feb 20, Mon",0

Through the prep process at the time we had heard of Rain Shed Fabrics. I really like this company and the products they carry. Earlier this month I ordered 65"" wide and 90"" long lightweight 30 denier coated ripstop (1.1 oz.). This will be the footprint for the tent. Also did some digging about making rain kilts.

I am planning on using Bronner's Soap for my toothpaste, skin cleaner, dish clean-up, etc. and even my hair shampoo. Well I thought I should at least use it on my hair before I embark on this journey. Surely don't need any surprises on the trail as I figure there will be enough of them. So this morning washing the hairs on the head with Bronner's was experimental while still in civilization. Actually pretty good results! No conditioner and just air dried. Maybe I won't have to shave most of my hair off before I begin this crazy trek after all. Simple pleasures",,Bronner's Soap,"Mar 07, Tue",0

THANKS STEPH!!I'm not wanting to rely totally on food drops or totally on town foods. Gonna mix things up until the wisdom kicks in I must say I'm pretty blown away with this dehydrated food idea. I dehydrated a PINT of homemade Marina sauce and that is the picture! One sheet of tomato leather is one whole pint!! Here are three pints. Crazy! Also made lots of oatmeal, powdered goat milk, pecans and dried fruit bags. Lunches will be tortilla, PB, honey, protein bars and like that.

My mind wandered to all the hikers out in the rain in the very area I was driving through. Well I have slept in a tent on the Superior Hiking Trail (SHT) in what I call a rain attack with wind and lightning overhead for two nights in a row. However when morning came and the attack was over packing camp in wet conditions was all I was subjected to. I ask myself why am I keeping a journal and answers like sharing with my friends and family come to mind. Also, to look back and laugh or cry or whatever as I remember a place I once was. Well I think I am in that place as I have NEVER HIKED IN THE RAIN!!! My daughter says ""Mom, it will be fun, like jumping through puddles and catching raindrops on your tongue!"" HAHAHA! Ok.

Well I know I will encounter this situation eventually but surely not on the first day. Will start Tuesday instead. Getting aquainted with the gear in the field will go more smoothly in nice spring weather right? That way I'll be ready for Thursday's storms!

I know now what it means to hike into or out of a ""gap"" and these were probably baby gaps Spring is here and trees have the start of leaves. Dogwoods blooming all through the woods. Water is not a problem. Tomorrow looks like 13 miles to the next shelter and not many options before that to tent. I will be starting early to do half before lunch and half afterwards. Beans and quinoa for dinner :) I took a bunch of pics but will put a few on here and a short video.

mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563686,"Just over a year and a half ago I lost a dear friend. His family talked of pennies from heaven and at the most unexpected times the pennies will appear. These penny appearances were his way of letting you know he was with you. I rolled my eyes in scepticism however the act of finding pennies is happening. Since his passing the craziest ""findings"" have followed me. I don't look for them and I never really found pennies before. I was still sceptical for a time but not anymore. I found  a penny on a huge pile of boulders on top of Black Rock Mtn. up in the middle of nowhere. Two found at the train station waiting for this adventure. Two found at the moment the shuttle was secure for the first trail head. There are even more bizarre findings... everyday so far! Along the same theme I remember my mom always had butterflies landing on her. After she passed away butterflies started landing on me. I know what you may be thinking...the woods are getting to her! Since I started this hike I have had butterflies landing on me every day! I may be a believer in the fourth dimension. 
Practical side...The hiker community is quite the mix of all sizes, ages, shapes. They have been all very friendly and helpful. One night I listened as a young girl spoke of an older hiker who told her how to hike up hill without expending more energy than needed. He said to take tiny steps uphill with legs pretty straight.  ""Like a robot"". She said it took some getting used to but actually saved muscle strength. A must try.
Practical side #2. I have been using wraps to put peanut butter and honey on. After a day or so the wraps had turned into one big glob of pasty white dough. Unable to separate pieces I just grabbed a glob and proceeded to choke down the blob. Another helpful hiker advice was to take a bag of whole wheat bread and squish it down. The pieces of bread will always separate! No blobs! Hey, it works :) Now I can buy yum bread w nuts and seeds!!","Calf Mountain Shelter

mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563688,"Ok. I love whippoorwills. As a child I would spend summers in the country and the whippoorwills would introduce the twilight hours. Their rhythmic song would lull me to sleep. I haven't heard their song for decades untill tonight. Grateful! Kinda. For awhile.anyway :)
 Gaps! Ah the gaps! As I tackle these beasts I wonder about the correlation between the gaps I face here on the trail and the ""gaps"" I face in every day life. The gaps between friendships, family, cultures, health, creative moments etc. All needing patience, perseverance, understanding and an open heart to what lies beyond.
I'm really getting a kick out of some of the trail names I have encountered such as dog-mouse, blitz, stretch. I remember seeing an AT cartoon showing the evolution of the hiker as an upright human then progressing downward to a human not able to walk upright. Something similar to the ape to man drawings ya see, only in reverse. Ha! I walk w my pack off and still bent forward.... I may change my trail name to ""right angle""!! Ha!!
Rained tonight.... All night!! What will tomorrow hold? Had to put in my ear plugs!

mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563692,"Well it was just a matter of time. Rain. Not just a little either. Loud and complete with fog and wind. Let up just enough to allow a wet camp breakdown. Hot coffee from the campground store and onward. I actually found it a bit enchanting to walk through the fog and mist. The trees seemed especially dark and animated against the mist in the wind. Streams and creeks appeared everywhere. The ground under my feet gave way as if walking on gel. Waters rolled off my pack cover as hoped. My design. Maybe I'll go into the pack cover design business. All the crazy thoughts that fill my head as I walk. About mid day the clouds part and the dark woods brighten into this glorious lime green. The smells are amazing! So many y bird sound. Really sensory delight. I hear rushing waters below as I stop for lunch. Food...PB on yum bread :)
I quickly find that those rushing waters, once a mild creek, are now an obstacle I must cross! Contemplating my route. Just do it! Cold water rush into my boots as I try to find the best footing. Hard to put my foot down as the waters are pushing it all over! Of course it all ends well but next time perhaps I'll take my boots off to keep them dry. What a fun day!!
Oh yeah I was gonna tell you about blister help. This is another one of those hiker wisdoms that was told to me. Pierce the blister with a clean needle and short piece of thread. Allow the thread to hang out both sides of the blister as to allow it to drain via the thread. Pull the thread through a day or so later after the draining stops. Keep clean w antibiotics and moleskin. It works BTW :0","Loft Mtn. Campground

mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564767,"Well, made it through Shenandoah National Park last Sunday! 108 miles behind me. Younguns can do this in 7-10 days but my green hiker legs are doing just fine :) I also noticed a few changes in my body as I hike  I and I thought I would share with you some of the things that stand out as important to do if you are considering a long distance hike.
1-Do those hip raises on the floor. Everything you do in a tent like putting clothes on and taking them off, moving that big ole bag around, blowing up the air mattress etc is pretty much on you side or back. Planks are also recommended.. side and front planks!
2-Triceps!! Those muscles will pull you forward and hold you back when your body is wanting to tumble forward downhill while holding onto your hiking poles.
3-Speaking of hiking poles... Grab a golf ball squeeze it and pound it into your palm for about 5 or more hours a day. Get your palms and hands strong!
4-Glutes. Get strong glutes. EVERYTHING is related to strong glutes! 
These are just some of my initial thoughts and suggestions. I'm sure a professional will add more to this list. All in all listen to your body and the Trail as things will be revealed as you need them. Happy hiking!","

Cool flower, cloud, fellow hiker, waterfall, leaf, critter, bird, insect... ANYTHING! My head is spinning with all the incoming visuals and sounds and smells. It took me a couple of week but I am finally slowing down and reaching a calmer state of appreciation. Not less appreciation just calmer. My son asked me write more about the ""experience"" and less about the daily destinations. So I will use this  Trail Journal blog to ponder some of those types of topics. My head is contemplating much while walking through these spaces but it takes days sometimes to make some sense of it and then write about these deeper ideas.

mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566065,"well, if you have been following my FB page (Suszy Bee), you know there have been a few setbacks. Nothing serious just lots of rain and fixing (hopefully) a leaking tent. Today, while spending time at the Tree House Campground, I sat and admired all the sweet flowers the owner had planted in the planters on the decking area. I also noticed about a block away the  Pottery space of Bill Van Gilder! Like a tiny perfect storm it hit me.... I miss my garden and deck and flowers and pottery studio and people I know and love! Ahhh. Now what! How do I deal with this? I'm sure this won't be the first time this comes over me. Rats! Wake up tomorrow and hike through all this muddy mess and think forward, NOT BACK. This life on the Trail, only 3+ weeks old, has such beautiful moments but the structure of home life is missing. There is starting to be a simple routine and I love the simpleness of it but never in the same place, never with the same surroundings, always different. But wait... I love that part of it also. WTH!!  The unpredictable is exciting but also sometimes emotionally draining. Day after day a new surprise around the corner. This is sweet! This is also draining! Ahhhh. Exhale Sue. You are here by choice. You will survive. You will learn. Find beauty and it will find you. I am not the first or the last to experience this. Thanks for listening. Hugs to all.","

mudsmeller,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576886,"Brief update before more going deeper...
PLAN = May 2, start north from Rockfish Gap with the intent to get to Katahdin by Sept and then back to Rockfish Gap to hike south to Springer and wrap this up by early November. Thus a through hike will have been completed!
REALITY = Hiked from Rockfish Gap on May 2 and hiked 500+ miles to Greenwood Lake, NY. Weather, bugs, water, and the dreaded boot/foot issues ended this part of the hike on 7/2. I have spent 8+ weeks at home and visiting family etc. Now is the time to get more miles in and get back out into the woods! Sept 5 will find me on another train ride back to Rockfish Gap and I will begin my southern section hike on 9/7 headed towards Springer Mtn. Hoping to finish by Thanksgiving.  
LASH = This is a new term I have recently heard...Long Ass Section Hiking.  I believe this is what my hike has turned into. I am comfortable with this term. I am comfortable with how this experience is unfolding. I recently had a loved one remark after I said I was going back in Sept to finish the lower section said ""now go and do it right this time"". I guess I was a bit puzzled not knowing there was a right or a wrong. HYOH (Hike Your Own Hike) really speaks!
DEEPER = A great and unexpected benefit to what has transpired here in the form of a LASH is the opportunity to reflect before the final mile. These reflections have brought about some attitude adjustments that otherwise may not have been dealt with till the opportunity to implement them had passed.This pause in hiking has afforded me that. Something as simple as the 22# I had lost in the 2 months on the trail has mostly returned in 8 weeks home. I know now that an action plan needs to be put in place upon my return. Something as deep as to answer myself as to WHY I am doing this and not to become a lemming or mindless hiker. I found myself pushing against so many of the trials. I am used to being able to work through situations and roll with them. The hills ahead, the weather, water conditions, etc. brought about mental distress that normally would never bother me! I was not prepared for this mental shift that I did not recognize in myself! Now feeling much more prepared as to what lies ahead and what will really be needed in me and of me, to roll more and push less against this experience. Ha! This AT is nudging me to a new level.
