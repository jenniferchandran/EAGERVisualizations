Ugh, these are the hardest miles when they don't count towards the AT miles. Met up with the same guys again. Outsider did not make it but is OK. Had a German guy and a French guy (young bucks). They were funny. One slept in a hammock and the second asked for us to squeeze in a 7th in a six man shelter. Worst night sleep for me.

Spanky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645178,"10/14/21. I was up and hiking by 7:30. Much needed early start. I got about 10 miles in when I stopped for lunch at the Toms Run Shelter. Temperatures are getting in the mid 80âs. Makes it tough carrying all this winter gear for nothing. I then hiked about another 4 miles to pine Grove Furnace State Park. Since they had a good water source and nice bathrooms, I decided to have dinner there. Water is tough to come by in the next bunch of miles so I took extra water for breakfast. I got in another 4.5 miles and again stayed at a non-description tent site. I like them because I typically end up being by myself. I stopped at mile marker 1109.2. 18.4 for the day. 137.1 miles for this section.","Tent site near Middle Ridge Road

Kept a steady pace but the Nats and Mosquitos were getting pretty bad. Again temperatures getting in the 80âs. Very little wind which makes it tough. Keeping hydrated is a challenge. Drinking as much water as I can before I take off. Using 2 liters of water as I go. The last few miles I had to cross over some farmers fields before entering Boiling Spring, PA. I stayed at Lisaâs Hostel which is basically an outside shed converted into a bedroom. Picture attached.Â Â Got to 1124.0 mile marker.

Roger had a root beer float and I had a brownie and apple washed down with Gatorade. We hiked a few more miles where Roger met up with his wife. Their daughter-in-law is having a Grand son so they were going to spend some time taking care of their other grand daughter. Well I am alone again!.

Made great time for the first 3.5 miles then ran into Pennsylvania rocks. After another 3 miles the trails got better. It appears that there are way more rocks in the trail so you have to focus on the ground. At 10 miles, I stopped and had lunch in a deep valley. I went ahead and soaked my feet in a stream. That felt so good. I continued to hike and about 4:00 PM I stopped at a stream and made dinner. Got my water set for the next day. I then hiked about another mile to an tent site.

Got up and scrambled eggs, ham, and green peppers (freeze dried). Took off and had a 1000 foot climb. Ended being 3.5 miles of smooth hiking (including the up hill) then Rocksylvania set in.

It rained all night but stopped at about 7:00 AM just enough to pack up camp and start hiking. It rained most of the day. The temperature dropped and is right now in the 40âs. Todayâs hike put us near Highpoint that is a superfund site for Zinc on top of a hill. The detour took you around the mountain and gave us beautiful views to the west.Â Â Unfortunately the rain and wind made it uncomfortably chilly. I always look forward to nice views and this was even better since it was walking a few miles with open views but again the weather made it cold. We hiked 10.6 miles to mile marker 1259.2.
