Ugh, these are the hardest miles when they don't count towards the AT miles. Met up with the same guys again. Outsider did not make it but is OK. Had a German guy and a French guy (young bucks). They were funny. One slept in a hammock and the second asked for us to squeeze in a 7th in a six man shelter. Worst night sleep for me.

Spanky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645178,"10/14/21. I was up and hiking by 7:30. Much needed early start. I got about 10 miles in when I stopped for lunch at the Toms Run Shelter. Temperatures are getting in the mid 80’s. Makes it tough carrying all this winter gear for nothing. I then hiked about another 4 miles to pine Grove Furnace State Park. Since they had a good water source and nice bathrooms, I decided to have dinner there. Water is tough to come by in the next bunch of miles so I took extra water for breakfast. I got in another 4.5 miles and again stayed at a non-description tent site. I like them because I typically end up being by myself. I stopped at mile marker 1109.2. 18.4 for the day. 137.1 miles for this section.","Tent site near Middle Ridge Road

Kept a steady pace but the Nats and Mosquitos were getting pretty bad. Again temperatures getting in the 80’s. Very little wind which makes it tough. Keeping hydrated is a challenge. Drinking as much water as I can before I take off. Using 2 liters of water as I go. The last few miles I had to cross over some farmers fields before entering Boiling Spring, PA. I stayed at Lisa’s Hostel which is basically an outside shed converted into a bedroom. Picture attached.  Got to 1124.0 mile marker. Taking a shower, cleaning clothes and ordering a sub for dinner.

Roger had a root beer float and I had a brownie and apple washed down with Gatorade. We hiked a few more miles where Roger met up with his wife. Their daughter-in-law is having a Grand son so they were going to spend some time taking care of their other grand daughter. Well I am alone again!.

Made great time for the first 3.5 miles then ran into Pennsylvania rocks. After another 3 miles the trails got better. It appears that there are way more rocks in the trail so you have to focus on the ground. At 10 miles, I stopped and had lunch in a deep valley. I went ahead and soaked my feet in a stream. That felt so good. I continued to hike and about 4:00 PM I stopped at a stream and made dinner. Got my water set for the next day. I then hiked about another mile to an tent site.

It rained all night but stopped at about 7:00 AM just enough to pack up camp and start hiking. It rained most of the day. The temperature dropped and is right now in the 40’s. Today’s hike put us near Highpoint that is a superfund site for Zinc on top of a hill. The detour took you around the mountain and gave us beautiful views to the west.  Unfortunately the rain and wind made it uncomfortably chilly. I always look forward to nice views and this was even better since it was walking a few miles with open views but again the weather made it cold. We hiked 10.6 miles to mile marker 1259.2.
