What a climb out of the Nantahala Outdoor Center -- 3000 ft. Took me 5.5 hours to hike 6.9 miles. Rain was in the forecast but only sprinkles after 8am. Staying at Sassafras Gap Shelter which is packed tonite because rain is predicted. Big shelter but very dirty. Wish I was in my tent.,"NOC

Got hardly any sleep last nite. Had to get up 3 times for a nature call. I know that was just because I wasn't sleeping. We had a brief rain shower around 10:30 but when I got up later the sky was full of stars. Trapper John said a mouse dropped on his face in the middle of the nite and he just laughed. I told him if that had happened to me the whole shelter and everyone camped nearby would have heard me screaming.Lots of up and downs today but not a huge elevation change like yesterday. It started raining around 12:15 but I didn't put on my rain gear or my pack cover because I thought it would stop like yesterday. I was wrong so after at least 1/2 hr. I finally found a place to stop and put them on. But I was already wet and so was the pack.Before I started hiking this morning I made a reservation at the Cabin in the Woods. Donna, one of the owners, picked me up at 4:30 and I'm sharing a cabin with Memo and Bruce, two sisters from CO and CA. Right now it's thundering, lightening and raining really hard. Glad I decided to stay here tonite. There will be a lot of soaked hikers tomorrow!","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Last nite it stormed for about 2.5 hrs. Lots of rain, thunder and lightning. I fell asleep while it was still storming...warm and cozy at The Cabin in the Woods. Donna and Phil are wonderful hosts. Donna made us breakfast sandwiches to take to the trail that were delicious. Started out ascending as usual. Before I knew it I was in Jacob's Ladder. It's a very steep section of trail. There are no signs saying when it starts and ends but I'd guess it's about a mile. There were another couple long ascents and then the trail leveled off a bit. The weather was 70s with beautiful sunshine and a cool breeze. Met several thru hikers...Popeye, Solomon, Scout and several more. Got to the shelter at 4:30 -- made good time today since I didn't start until 10:30. Great day on the trail...one of the best I've ever had. No cell service tonite.

More uphill as soon as I leave the shelter. Headed to Fontana Village to pick up a dropbox and spend the nite. The weather is great again today. I saw my first snake for this year. Don't know what kind it is but it wss only 18"" long. I went around and it slithered across the trail. At one point I got to the top of the mountain and saw Fontana Lake way below. It""s quite a sight -- beautiful clear blue.My feet were aching by the time I arrived at Rt. 28 where a shuttle will take hikers into Fontana. There is a phone at the restrooms that you can use to call for the shuttle and for $3 they come pick you up. Fontana is very hiker friendly...Lots of hikers have a dropbox sent there and stay at the Inn. They also have good resupply items. Checked in and got my dropbox then Gadget Legs and I went to the Pitstop for lunch. Kate gave us a ride down the hill and we enjoyed hotdogs and nachos. Luckily we got another shuttle ride back up to my room. Gadget Legs had been doing a section hike and was leaving the trail today. Amazingly a friend of hers had driven in to meet here and when Gadget got to the Inn and got a cell signal they connected and they left. I showered and dried out my tent since we had a heavy dew last nite and I had to take it down very damp. Had a salad for dinner and made phone calls.Didn't sleep well because the air conditioner in the room next door ran all nite. I finally turned on the TV to drown out the noise.","Cable Gap Shelter

Went to do laundry at 8am when the laundromat opened. Didn't realize I needed to get change and detergent at the general store next door which didn't open until 9am. So didn't get done until 10:30. Decided to take a zero because I was tired and wasn't even packed up yet.It was a productive day because I reworked how I wanted to hike the GSMNP (Great Smokey Mtn. Natl. Park). Each hiker must have a permit which is good for 8 days and 7 nights and I was concerned about finishing in that time. You must stay at the shelters which limits your options. So I relaxed and figured out how to accomplish the next 71 miles.Feeling much better both physically and mentally!","Fontana Village

WOW it...What a climb today. I was on the trail by 8:15 because I asked Kate, the shuttle driver, to pick me up at 8:00. It rained and stormed last night but I didn't hear it. It was still sprinkling when I started hiking. Walked by the ""Fontana Hilton"" which is the shelter for the area. It holds 20 hikers, has a restroom, shower, and charging station. Visited for a few minutes and took some pics. Then walked across Fontana Dam and up Shuckstack Mountain (2100' ascent). It had stopped raining but was very windy which made it cold. Don't know how cold but probably in the 40s. My phone hadn't shut off after taking pics and the battery died. I thought I had 13 hrs. of battery life on this new phone...I guess not. No pics or communication until Gatlinburg in 4 days.
Hiked the .1 mi. up to the Shuckstack fire tower but it looked too rickety to climb. Mom and I had hiked Shuckstack 10-12 yrs. ago and it was just as hard this time as it was then.
I'm now in GSMNP where I have to stay in shelters or campsites. When I arrived at Birch Spring Gap campsite the wind was really blowing up thru the gap but I had to stay because the next shelter was more than 5 mi. further and I was too tired. The wind has died down a little but it's going to be cold tonight.","Fontana Village

Put on sunscreen but got burned in the areas I missed. There was no shade on the trail because the trees don't have leaves yet. It was a long hard day--lots of ups and downs. I had taken 2 allergy pills this morning because the pollen is kinda bad. That really dried me up which was great but I ran out of water. The last mile took me almost an hour to do and when I walked into the shelter I immediately asked for water which Momentum gladly supplied. Then Tarzan (who I'd never met) offered to go fill up my water bottle. Momentum said better take him up on that offer because the creek was a little ways. I gladly accepted. Thank you both!!!
It's cold and windy again tonite and I think it's blowing in rain. Slept in my tent since the shelter is full. I was so tired that I didn't pay attention to which way the wind was blowing when I pitched my tent (actually I wasn't sure which way to pitch it because the wind was sorta swirling) and I picked the wrong direction. Wind bombarded the side of my tent all nite. It held though...And I was warm and comfy.","Russell Field Shelter

The wind howled all nite last night. I had pitched my tent the wrong way but it withstood the wind all night. I was cozy and warm but didn't sleep much because of the wind blowing on my tent? first in one direction then the other. It started raining at 8:00 so I decided to wait to pack up and see if it would stop and it did. So I was half done when it started to rain again. I had my tent halfway doen so I finished quickly and grabbed everything and ran to the shelter. By that time every thing was wet and I still had to finish getting it in the pack. What a mess. It rained the whole day and I ended up hiking in thunder and lightning part of the time. I got to Siler Bald Shelter at 2:45 but had planned to continue to the next shelter. I was soaked even tho I had on my rain gear. Someone asked me to come in and get warm. I walked in and the shelter was already full but they had a big fire going in the fireplace. I've never seen so much wet gear hung all over the place. The guys were tightening up the tarps so the rain and wind wouldn't get in. Â There were 2 section hikers expected who had reservations so I knew I had to leave since it was already full. Several hikers moved closer together and made room for me and told me not to go back out in the rain. I was so grateful!!Everyone dried out our footwear and as many clothes as possible. It took all evening and most of the night for all of us to get clothes dry enough to put on in the morning. The guys kept wood cut for the fire and Rock Star got water for all of us--he made 2 trips for some of us. The fire kept us warm all nite and we took turns stoking it all nite. I did a 3:15-4:00am stint. I had woken up at 3am and couldn't get back to sleep so I relieved the hiker watching the fire. Went back to bed and slept very soundly until 6:30am.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558954,"Started out hiking with 2nd Dinner. We had met several times at shelters. Again, she hikes faster than me but she waited for me at Clingman's Dome. 
On my way up the mountain I passed 2 women hikers. The second one said ""I know you."" I didn't recognize her but come to find out she (Ziplock) and Repack were on the trail in 2015 the day we all came out of Hiawassee and we leapfrogged most of that day. I was having trouble with my ankle and they remembered me. Incredible that I would run into them hiking southbound from Clingman's Dome. They've been doing sections since that time too. It's true...You never know who you'll run into on the trail.
It was a challenging climb but made it by 12:30. We hitched into town and a great couple (Terry and Jennifer from Michigan) gave us a ride. They were staying at the Econolodge and since we didn't have any hotel reservation we just had them take us there. Great hotel for $62+tax. We showered and then Terry and Jennifer took us to the Food Lion to resupply. Thanks so much Terry and Jennifer...Real trail angels!!!We had pizza at the Mello Mushroom and by the time we were finished eating we were exhausted so just relaxed the rest of the evening. Laundry will have to wait until tomorrow.","Siler Bald Shelter

Yum!! Then went to the laundromat. They have a great trolley system here and for 50 cents you can get around easily. Went to the Dollar Store for sunscreen then 2nd Dinner and I ate lunch at McDonald's. I had a bacon ranch salad...It was so good. As we were walking to catch the trolley 2 women in a van stopped and asked us if we were hikers. They offered us a ride back into town. Turns out they are also hikers and one of them is recovering from an injury and they had hooked up with a ministry in town who had loaned them the van to provide rides for hikers. They offered to take us back to Clingman's Dome tomorrow so we'll let them know what time. That's great since the shuttle driver 2nd Dinner had called was going to charge $70.
We just ate leftover pizza for dinner and then walked around town. Not nearly as many people out tonight, probably because storms are expected.","

In the morning 2nd Dinner made the same decision. After breakfast we walked to the outfitter's. We had found out that the road to Clingman's Dome was closed due to ice and snow so we couldn't have started there anyhow. We bought a few things we needed and went to Bennett's BBQ.

It was during the snow storm and she was a strong hiker but just got too cold. She had left the shelter to hike but came back a few minutes later and passed out after she sat down. Took the hikers in the shelter with her a little while to convince the rangers to send the helicopter.Another bad situation happened a couple of days ago. A father was hiking with his son and broke his ankle but made it to the shelter but couldn't walk so the rangers did a horse rescue.

Finally got to the shelter around 4:00 and set up my tent. Â Â Dried out my quilt and a few other things. Â It's supposed to rain tonight but we dodged it all day and 2 dark rain clouds passed over in the first couple of hours I was here.Â  Hope my luck holds out.
Just a note...The privies since we left the Smoky Mtn. NP are awful.Â  They are really small, for example if they have a door it hits your knees when you sit down.Â  The one at this shelter doesn't have a door so it's not a problem, but the sides aren't tall enough so you don't know if you're giving everyone a show when you stand up.Â  Who built these things??
There was a bear here a couple nights ago.Â  He just rattled the bear cables then left when he couldn't get any of the food bags down.Â  Hope he doesn't visit tonight.Â  A couple of hikers have dogs so I wouldn't think he'd come near.Â  We'll see.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Inn and she had a room available for the night.Â  It was $100 and a little too steep for us.Â  She did take us to the restaurant 4 miles down the road so we got cold soda after all and then she brought us back to the trail. Â Thanks Vicki!
The next part of the trail was thru pasture land... very pretty.Â  We pitched our tents in a wooded area next to a pasture full of cows.Â  We ate dinner and then I noticed the cows moving from one pasture to the other and a little brown calf stayed in the pasture all by himself.Â  A huge mother cow came up over the hill but ignored the calf and went in the second pasture with all the other cows.Â  I stood and watched all this and then the mother cow went back to the first pasture and up over the hill still ignoring the little calf.Â  She was concerned about something down the other side of the hill so I decided to find out what.Â Â  I crossed the ladder over the fence and walked cautiously toward the cow being careful not to get between the cow and calf.Â  As I walked over the top of the hill I didn't see anything.Â  Then I saw what looked like a rock move.Â  I walked closer keeping my eye on the cow.Â  It was another calf and as I talked softly to it, it struggled to stand up and finally did.Â  It walked toward mom and I moved the other direction.Â  I was so happy when the calf started nursing.Â  All the other cows had moved to the gate and were watching.Â  I had to walk in front of all of them so I just moved slowly and talked softly until I got over the fence.Â  A couple of hours later I heard one cow very upset but it was too dark to see what the problem was.Â  There are no houses close around here so I don't know who these cows belong to.
We had a brief rain shower before I went to sleep, hope that's all the rain we get tonight.","Vandeventer Shelter

Â We walked to Shady Valley which was 2.7 miles and had lunch at the only restaurant in town.Â  The cheeseburger and fries were delicious.Â  Then we went across the road to the country store.Â  Both the clerk and another man said we'd be able to get a ride to Damascus if we just waited for someone to come into the store.Â  So we waited about an hour and only 4-5 people came in and none were going to Damascus, but they insisted we'd get a ride. Another half hour passed and still no ride.Â  Then the tornado warnings came on our phones.Â  The storm came in very quickly. Â We could see the clouds rolling on top of the mountain we'd hiked over this morning. Â No Worries looked out the window and saw someone's roof flying across the field.Â  The clerk was scared and on the phone to her boss who told her to go to the basement.Â  She said she had an ""old couple"" in the store with her and her boss said to take them with her.Â  The electricity had gone out a few minutes before and there were 3 others in the store with us.Â  We found out that these people were going to Damascus and they graciously agreed to give us a ride so we were on our way.Â  Thank you Bill and brother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

We hit the trail by 8:50am.Â  We took the Virginia Creeper Trail which is the old AT because it's an old railroad bed and easier and more scenic.Â  We stopped to eat our lunch at Taylor's Valley.Â  The trail goes right beside the creek which is now a raging river due to all the rain.Â  It was a very scenic walk.
It warmed up this afternoon and we were actually too warm.Â  About 1:30 we sat down on a bench next to the trail and just closed our eyes.Â  A young hiker came along and we both looked up and the hiker looked concerned and asked if we were ok.Â  I guess we didn't look too good.Â  We were tired and our packs were heavy from resupply and we had already hiked over 10 miles.

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568256,"We started out at 7:40 hikng toward Partnership Shelter.Â  Our plan was to get a ride from the Mt.Roger's Visitor Center into Marion for the night.Â  The hike was about normal but rocky.Â  Â I had just reached a smooth stretch of trail when I saw No Worries on his knees beside the trail facing away from me.Â  I hurried toward him and asked him if he was sick, then I saw his bloody face.Â  He had tripped on a small tree stump at the side of the trail.Â Â  I pulled out my first aid kit and wet wipes and cleaned his face.Â  He had 2 gashes on his forehead and several cuts on his nose.Â  I was worried that he would need stitches on his forehead.Â  He complained about his neck hurting and I thought he'd probably twisted it trying to keep his face from hitting the ground.Â  I put Band-Aids on his cuts and he said he was ready to go.Â  So we put on our packs and started walking.
In about 1/4 mile we came to a gravel road and decided we should try to get to town from there instead of hiking the last 4 miles to Partnership Shelter.Â  I still thought No Worries needed to go to a Medcheck to get his cuts cleaned and possibly get some stitches.Â  I pulled out my phone and realized I didn't know who to call.Â  I started with the Mt. Roger's Visitors Center hoping they could send a ranger or someone to take us to town.Â Â  They told me to call the sheriff's office and gave me the number.Â  I called and they asked me to call back in on 911 so they could get a ping from my phone.Â  I was fairly sure we were at VA 601 but they didn't know exactly where it crossed the AT.Â  Finally after I walked down the road several hundred yards they got a ping and said they would send rescue.Â  Didn't know what that meant but it was already in progress.
Â After about 15 minutes and no one had come I started to call again when we heard noise at the trail crossing.Â  No Worries had walked down to where I was when I was on the phone earlier so no one was at the trail crossing to tell them where we were so I started running uphill to the noise.Â  I rounded the curve and saw an ambulance with red lights flashing.Â  I thought oh no, this is overkill.Â  No Worries thought the same thing.Â  The EMTs examined No Worries and after he complained about his neck, they put him in a collar.Â  They took us to Marion Hospital and after a Cat Scan the doctor told us that No Worries had fractured his C-1 and C-2 vertebrae in his neck.Â  We were both stunned.Â  After discussion the doctor arranged for us to go by ambulance to the Johnson City Medical Center since Marion Hospital isn't equipped to handle his injury.Â  Â It was an hour and 40 minute ride to Johnson City.Â  The neurosurgeon will talk to No Worries tomorrow to tell him whether surgery is needed.","Trimpi Shelter

Â This caused her to stagger like a drunk for about four steps before she regained her balance. Â Her boot was covered in muck. Â Oh yuck!
I was feeling a little more confident late afternoon but took another tumble. Â This time I scraped my elbow and had to take off my pack to get up. Â This part of the hike is not going well. Â Rosie Red is doing great but I'm struggling. Â We stopped at Gentian Pond Shelter and this was Rosie Red's first nite in a shelter. Â She isn't any fonder of them than I am, but it will keep you dry. Â Rain was in the forecast so we didn't pitch the tent. Â There were only 3 of us in the shelter and Wind Chime set up his hammock nearby. Â The water source was down a huge rockface and I had had enough so Rosie Â Red went down to get the water. Â She was a trooper because the bugs were biting horribly and she had to get a lot of water so neither of us would have to go back down there (like I could have gone down).
The view from the shelter was gorgeous. Â I didn't sleep well and was up at 5am taking pictures. Â (The birds in ME start chirping at 4:30 am when it gets light.) Â Â We even had to go up a rock to get to the privy.","Trident Col Campsite

hiking at 5:00.Â  I had only planned to do
3 miles and I arrived at the shelter just as it got dark (7:45).Â  As usual it was a long uphill climb out of

the way.

to get to the shelter before dark so I didn't wait.Â  I will be at the top of Mt. Greylock tomorrow
night and hopefully will see a great sunset then.

here.Â  I can see at least 3 other tents
and don't know if anyone is in the shelter.Â 
I met 3 guys going northbound on my way up.Â  One was a Nobo who said he is the last of the
northbound bubble.Â  The next hiker was a section
hiker but he said he'd turned the wrong way and gotten lost and was now out of
time and had to work tomorrow so he was headed home.Â  I got a kick out of the last person I talked
to.Â  I must have looked really tired because
he asked me if I was ok and when I told him yes, I could tell he didn't believe
me and he asked if I was sure.Â  He acted
like he thought he should do something to help me but didn't know what.Â  Very nice of him to be concerned.
Tomorrow is a short day also but climbing the whole time.Â  Got to get to the top of Greylock before the restaurant
stops serving lunch (4:30) because you can't cook up there and the dinner is a

change but then an ascent up to Mt. Williams where I stopped for a snack.Â  Then did a ridge walk the rest of the morning.Â  Ate lunch at the top of an old ski run (Big

shorter than I expected.Â  I only hiked
3.3 miles (plus .3 from the shelter).Â  I
was done for the day by 1:45.

from the mountain top most of the afternoon.Â

that about his glider.
