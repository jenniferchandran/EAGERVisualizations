Jody Chancey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516755,"Thereâ€™s nothing quite like travel and the outdoors. I got so inspired this past year in India while doing a 10-day silent retreat on the Introduction to Buddhism. I do not consider myself a Buddhist, but I did take a lot from the course and more importantly the people I met while at the course. The connections I made and their inspirational journeys have made me explore what I want out of my life. This journey for me will continue on the Appalachian Trail and the months leading up to the trip. I will be sharing those stories here in the hopes of helping me grow, as well as, maybe inspiring you to explore your own paths. Join me for this magnificent ride we call life.

Jody Chancey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516758,"I am currently testing out trail shoes but was wondering about the benefits of boots? Are they needed for the cold/rocky portions of the trail? Is Gortex a good or bad thing for the trail?
Any suggestions on light weight boots for a very wide foot (4E)?",,View Entry,"Nov 02, Mon",0
Jody Chancey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517858,I spent the day hiking up from Woody Gap. It was my first time on the AT in preparation for my 2017 thru-hike. I have a lot of work to do .,,First Day of Training,"Nov 17, Tue",0
Jody Chancey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517860,"I spent the weekend on the Florida Trail testing out some gear. It was a very successful overnight and I loved my ZPacks Duplex tent. It was very easy to setup and takedown and kept me dry from the humidity and dew. I was not happy with the Big Agnes sleeping pad. It was noisy (I turn in my sleep) and I felt like I was going to fall off all the time. I need to test out other options. The pad did, however, keep me warm from the cold ground.",,First Overnight in Training,"Nov 30, Mon",0
