IPA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559948,"The start of an epic journey. Up at 4 for the flight to Atlanta. It was a difficult ride and goodbye at the airport. ""Leaving"" Mary for 5+ months I know will be the hardest part. Without such an amazing and incredibly supportive best buddy, no way could I attempt this trip. What took me by surprise - although it should not have - was the support of our many friends. Several outstanding send off parties, many text messages, phone calls, etc. I sometime think they are more excited then me!Despite the difficulty of attempting this thru hike, I am excited yet calm and can't wait to begin. Let's hope our checked bag arrives (the last anxiety) then we will be off to Springer. Bag arrived! We got shuttled to springer and started hiking at 1:30. First mile south to the beginning of the trail was a bit of a wake up call. It was hot and up hill all the way. We signed in, took the obligatory pics at the southern terminus, reversed course and hiked to hawk mt camp sites. Hike was surprisingly easy. Dogwoods blooming, trees budding out, a nice waterfall. We arrived at hawk at 5:00, set up camp, filtered water (we need a bit more practice doing that) and ate subs we purchased at lunch. About 8 of the thirty sites occupied We were surprised at how quiet it is out here. Overall the day was a 10, evening a 10.5! We are sure every day will be like this.","Springer Mt

I'm sure he heard me. Several times heard critters running around thru the site. How cool is that!Will said I was a champion snorer and perhaps he would not tent quite as close to me in the future. I'm sure he was glad I gave him ear plugs. Breakfast of granola and powdered milk. We both need to figure out how to reduce camp sprawl. While we don't have much equipment we sure made a mess. Left at 9, arrived Gooch Mt shelter at 1:30 and snagged tent sites. Sassafras Mt was the big climb of the day. We handled it quite well. Some amazing views and lots of interesting sections. Camp filled up by about 4. I'm guessing 50 people. For as few people we saw at Hawk Mt tent site and the few people we saw on the trail, tonight's camp is packed. Sounds like this mini bubble of people spent the night at Hawk Mt shelter. Day 2 finished and so far exceeding expectations.","Hawk mt camp site

IPA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560168,"A bit better night sleeping up around 6:30. Moon out and partly cloudy. Even though so many people around still pretty quiet at this hour. After 2 whole days on the trail Will and I are pleased with out equipment choices and weight of packs. Maybe a pound+ of extra clothes an a extra pound or so food, but the extra clothes will come in handy if the temps drop. We have not been eating as much as we thought. According to some of the more experienced hikers - pretty common the first few days people don't have much of an appetite. I'm guessing that is going to change in a hurry! We have been blessed with two outstanding weather days although we did get a shower this afternoon. The hiking umbrellas were a game changer.    Good way for us very experienced hikers to get initiated to the trail. We ran into the first person who was hiking and talking on the phone. We quickly sped by him. Rolled into lance creek camp at at about 1:15 (we started this morning at 8:45). It is a bit boring till the other folks start to roll in 3:30-4:00. Then the entertainment starts. Our feet are doing well. We were both a bit apprehensive but due to the great help of our podiatrist Dr. Count - so far so good. We feel good and have decide to slowly start to increase miles - start doing 10 to 12 after tomorrow. On to Neel gap and our first resupply.","Gooch Mt shelter

Just thought I would let you at home reading this know just in case you loose your pillow some night. I was just thinking it has 3 days since I've last read any news, check twitter, stock prices, etc. Now when's the last time that happened? Let's see if I can make it past Neel gap without doing so. Hike up Blood MT was not bad. In fact we crushed it. Views unbelievable. We were quickly reminded it was Saturday as there were many folks who day hiked up - including an energetic Boy Scout troup. We had lunch (at 10:30) at the top then proceeded down to Neel Gap / Mountain Outfitters. Loads of folks there. We resupplied and got pack shake downs. As our pack weights were good, only a couple of minor suggestions of gear to consider removing (""you can use your pocket knife and get rid of the finger nail clippers""). Several of the group who we have camped with the past two nights are getting cabins and may take a zero tomorrow. Will and I decided to push on another few miles. We are stealth camping somewhere near Swain gap spring - about 3 miles beyond Neel gap. We ate dinner then had our first most comical bear bag hanging adventure. I'm not so sure our food will be there in the morning. Oh well only 3+ miles back to Neel gap. Today again a 10+ day. Only hitch was one of Will's trekking poles broke. He will get a new set in Hiawassee in 2 days. We are planning our first zero day there also.","Lance creek

IPA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560436,"Happy Easter! No sun rise this morning - a bit overcast. Our first successful night of stealth camping AND our bear bags survived so we can eat this morning. I thought Will was a bit caviler about hanging them last night. IMO, a bit too low, too near the tree and WAY too close to my tent. He was conveniently located 75 to 100 yard away. Maybe he was expected me to keep watch over them. I hope nothing more sinister. Nothing too exciting to report on today's journey. Seemed a bit quiet on the trail. We only saw 3 of the folks of the mini group we were with the first few days. We went by Low Gap Shelter at about 1:30 - 2. Typically by then there is activity at the shelters, but no one was there. We hiked another few miles and are stealth camping about 7 miles from Unicoi Gap. We will hike there tomorrow and catch a shuttle into Hiawassee where we have a room booked at the Budget Inn. We had a wonderful Easter dinner prepared and eaten alfresco. Will had roman noodles cooked al dente finished with tuna prepared in a delicate buffalo chicken style sauce. I opted for creamy mashed potatoes accented with a hint of apple wood smoked bacon finished with a zesty cheddar flavored cheese product.","Swaim Gap Spring

When I get up at night (I'm not a good sleeper, we drink tons of water, and the normal middle age man syndrome) I typically walk around and stretch. The sky is so clear and it is very quiet except for occasional owl calls. The waning moon is still obscuring the star show, but man are they bright and many of them. Saw my first shooting star in a long time. Looking forward to the new moon. We hiked down to Unicoi gap to head to Hiawassee. First trail magic - granola bars AND a retired gentlemen, Kip, who drove us into town. I got to sit in the back with his two friendly dogs (one of which asked how Breck was doing). Very modest road side motel (vintage 1950s that we have all passed by but have never stayed in - on par with the Trails Inn Rumfort ME) Budget Inn, was our destination. We showered, obtained some beer, and sat out in front of our room drinking beer, doing wash, and nothing else for several house. The biggest comfort was sitting in chairs after 6 days sitting on logs, rocks, and the ground. Did some resupply - 4 days worth till the next town - and had a pretty good barbecue pulled pork dinner. We plan to hang low tomorrow, hit the trail in the afternoon and look for a camp site before the 1000 foot climb to the top of Rocky MT in just over a mile with fully loaded packs. Yikes!","2 miles north of low gap

Will and I both discussed while we were looking forward to a day off the trail, it wasn't a ""omg can't wait to get off the trail, eat real food and sleep in a real bed"". More of a nice break Had my first beer in over a week last night and having my first coffee. Strangely haven't missed either. Still have not checked news, twitter, the stock market etc.. Not missing those either. Have only heard the T word twice so far. Once on top of Blood Mt (one of the day hikers mention him to another, fortunately I did not get the context) and a quick reference to him on Barstool. Something about him signing a little boys hat then not giving it back but tossing it into the crowd. Will introduced me to Barstool. I watched the April 17 Run Down. He is addicted, I'm thinking it is a generational thing.   I have been listening to music (Spotify rules!) only a few minutes in the morning and just before going to bed. We took it easy today. Breakfast and hung out at the hotel. Fred who has been part of our mini group rolled into the hotel. We had a late lunch - Subway - then hitched hiked back to the trail. Only took about 30 seconds before someone pulled over and offered us a ride. Must have been my good looks - or my handy dandy sign I've been itching to use. I feel like an official thru hiker now!We did the just over a mile up to the top of Rocky Mt, made camp and had the second half of our foot long Subway sandwiches (no cooking tonight , takeout!). We met Jamie and Ramey who are section hiking to Virginia. Louie and Tex pass by our site. Again two folks part of our mini group.","Unicoi gap

Just before going to sleep, I stepped outside for a comfort break. Most amazing transformation. Mist had rolled in and it was the coolest steel blue gray color out. A kinda creepy / Halloween feeling to the woods as trees have yet to leaf out at this elevation. Almost expected to see the headless horseman ridding through the woods! Pic is a perfect bear bag hang. We started this leg with Each bag having 4+ days of food. Each day of food weighs approximately 2 lbs, costs $10 - $12, and contains about 4000 calories. 4000 calories and you get to lose weight. Top that Jenny Craig! Our longest day to date. We did 14 miles. It was very misty/foggy most of the day. Two loooong up hill climbs. Not many on the trail. We rolled into camp (Moreland gap) at about 4, got water, set up and had Ramon with a package of chicken. Looks like we may be the only ones at the site tonight. Only 10 miles till we say goodbye to Georgia and hello to North Carolina.","Rocky Mt

Just quiet time sitting on a log. Today I felt as good as ever and moved along at a good clip - that is until just before lunch and after we entered North Carolina.About 30 minutes before lunch, my pack started feeling very heavy. I was wondering if Will put a rock or two in it! After a lunch, felt fine again. Around 2 we crossed the Georgia North Carolina border. 1 state down, 13 more to go! The state of North Carolina was not very welcoming. Two turns and 100 yards in we got slammed with two VERY steep climbs. Progress slowed to what seemed to be 100 feet per hour. Someone needs speak to the NC tourist bureau!We rolled into muskrat creek shelter did the setup, water, and dinner routine. Met a small group of hikers who have been traveling together the past week. Sounds like Will and I have been just ahead or behind them the past few days. The shelter area was not too crowded but after 3 -4 nights stealth camping, ( 2 of which we were the only ones at the site) not use to the ""crowds"".","Moreland gap

All you can do is pack up the wet tent, fly, and ground cover then dry them out later in the day - which we did at lunch. Met a 54 year old man last night. Has back/disc issues but is hiking along with a cane. He said he is going as far as he can. He is going shelter to shelter - 5 to 8 a day?? Also met a nice couple from Maine, Matt and Gretchen. They have to be done early September. We may bump into them again, except they don't plan on their first zero till hot springs 273 miles in. We will probably do our next zero at the Nantahala Outdoor Center 3 days from now. North Carolina was much nicer to us today. Was quite easy hiking for most of the day. A mid afternoon rain show which created muddy conditions. Miles and miles of terrain that was burned last year. We believe this was the section of the trail that was closed last year. Saw quite a few thru hikers heading south. We think these are folks who thru hiked last year and are doing this section that they missed last year. Got to camp and did the normal setup routine. Only exciting thing was the squirrel that immediately attacked my pack and destroyed my hip pocket zipper going after the nuts I had in there. We are now more worried about the squirrels getting to our bear bag verses the bears!Tomorrow about 11 miles to Franklin NC where we will go into town, grab a hotel room, resupply, and refuel. Maybe, just maybe, we might check out the two breweries/taprooms. We will pass the 100 mile mark very early in the day.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

We looked for a lottery outlet to play the number but alas saw none. We had an early lunch. The real cool thing was the new mini group we have been bumping into / camping with the pas few days - Nick (from Long Island), Dave (from Toronto) Steve (from Arizona) Chris (who we thought would be way ahead of us) Matt and Gretchen (from Maine) all passed us with hearty ""Hey guys"" as they passed by.   Got to Winding Stairs Gap and hitched hiked into town. A nice middle aged couple picked us up. They never picked up thru hikers before. We got to sit in the back of their truck with their dog Falcor. A friendly dog but no Breck. Stayed at the lovely budget inn - a step or two (or three or more) below the other budget inn we stayed at in Hiawassee - but all part of the trail experience. Had an outstanding burger at the lazy hiker brewery. Beers just ok. Bought too much food for the next two days. That will be our next resupply / day in town and potential zero day.","Betty Creek Gap

We started in the rain and it basically rained all day. We started the day using our umbrellas and then hiked without any rain gear till lunch. We ate at Wayah Bald stone tower. We were the only ones there. Was cold, wet and windy. Our first unpleasant experience. Switched to rain jackets for the rest day. Trail was very muddy after lunch. It reminded us of the pictures of the muddy world war 1 trenches - although they had it 100 times worse then we did. We made good time even with all the rain and mud. Despite the conditions, was actually quite nice hiking. The fun and games ended when we got to camp. It was raining hard when we arrived and had to set up. Luckily we had our umbrellas which aided in keeping the tents dry as we set them up. Will dove into his tent. I decided to stay out, cook (some sort of rice side) and eat. I must have been quite a sight hunched under my umbrella eating my freezer bag dinner. No one witnessed the sad sight as all were hunkered down inside their tents. I finished setting up camp and hung my bear bag. I was wet and cold but wanted to get all done before changing into dry clothes and getting into my sleeping bag. I knew once in, I was not going to want to venture out again. Let's hope the good old REI Quarter Dome tent does its job again tonight and keeps out the rain - at least most of it. Can't wait to put on wet cold clothes tomorrow!","Winding Stairs Gap / Franklin

While the rain held off over the night, we basically slept in a cloud and it was the coldest night & morning so far. We all slept in jackets, socks, long pants. Everything was sopping wet in the morning. Will and I broke camp as quickly as possible. Getting into wet/damp clothes was not as bad as we thought except for the totally WET and COLD socks - now that was more than unpleasant. After the first mile we began to warm up and shed layers. I mentioned before the fire damage. Today it reared its ugly head again. Simply amazing the burned and charred landscape. The smell of damp burnt wood/charcoal still very strong. Kinda scary and creepy. Several places the trail was very damaged and we needed to proceed with much caution. Downhill hikes are by far the most difficult. About 4 miles downhill Into the NOC, nantahala outdoor center.   Our knees were speaking loudly to us - and not pleasant words! I would rather climb up a mountain 10 times verses descend once. (See tomorrow's post after we do the 7 mile accent - I may chance my tune). We experienced what we think is the alternative trail culture today. Many ""younger"" folks that seemed to be on the trail not thru hiking but being something similar to ski bums ( trail bums???) smoking dope (as my generation would say or smoking weed as Will's generation would say) and just hanging out. Will spoke to a couple of guys who were ""probably going to spend a third day here"". Tomorrow marks our 14th day on the trail. This a big milestone as Will and I always talked about just making it thru 14 days then seeing what's next. Amazing but I have yet to look at / hear / seek out any news, stocks, sports, etc. I'm guessing the Patriots have won at least 2 SuperBowls since we left, Celtics and Bruins bounced in the first round of playoffs. Go Red Sox!Big climb tomorrow. 7 miles 4000 feet to sassafras Gap shelter. Might be a short post. Wish us luck.","cold springs shelter

IPA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561794,"Based on yesterday's decent into the NOC, we were expecting a difficult climb up Sassafras MT this morning. Turns out it was just a gradual 7 mile assent. A few short steeps, but very doable. A good 10 to 15 degrees colder at the top and in the clouds so was chilly. We were prepared to hike 8 to 10, 12 max. On the backside of sassafras We picked up extra water expecting to stealth camp somewhere without water. After carting it about 3 to 4 miles (mostly up hill) we decided to push on to Brown Fork shelter, another 3 miles, so dumped the extra water. Nothing like carrying an extra 4 pounds of water around the mountains for nothing. Last 1.5 miles into Brown Fork were a killer. Multiple very steep sections. We arrived exhausted. Only ones at the camp / shelter were Gretchen, Matt and Greg. We have been traveling with them 3 or 4 days now. Gretchen and Matt are strong fast hikers. Even they said the last 1.5 mikes were tough. Hikers rolled in and the show began. Act 1. One young girl (Dutch??) who we passed earlier in day, she was wheezing, huffing and puffing on a not difficult section, arrived and proclaimed ""After that I'm going to smoke so many f***ing cigarettes tonight."" Act 2. A guy spent well over 1/2 hour trying to hang a bear bag. Provided all at the shelter lots of laughs. He was still trying when we left to go to our tents. Wonder if he will still be there trying in the morning. Many other characters and acts. Always entertaining staying at the shelters. Even if we stay at a shelter site, we always pitch a tent and avoid staying in the shelter and using the privies.

Sadly we think this will be the last day we see Gretchen, Matt and Greg as they are going further than us today and don't plan to zero for quite awhile. But hey you never know. Besides we will meet other folks along the way. Spring showed up big time today, especially as we descended into Fontana Dam. Trees really leafing out, ground cover really green - a green carpet- lots of woodland flowers. Sun was out the entire day. Just wonderful. We were going to spend the night at the Fontana Dam Shelter, fondly called the Fontana Hilton (we will find out just how Hiltonie it is in 2 days), then stay one night at the Fontana Lodge, but as we entered the parking lot, Dad decided to spring for an extra night of civilization. (Actually I was thinking about it half way through the day - but don't tell Will). The Lodge is a real vacation place - somewhere you would go with the family for a few days vacation in the mountains. Has proper rooms, comfy beds, pillows and house keeping service every day. We obtained beers (of course) and showered. I had some sort of leaf material stuck to my feet the past few days that took some considerable scrubbing to get off. It is now stuck on the bathtub floor. Will opted to sit inside on the bed and catch up on Barstool. I can't understand why after 2 weeks on the trail he wanted to be inside on the comfy bed. A few posts ago I wrote about setting up in the driving cold rain on Cold Springs Shelter. Advertised at the site were bear cables to hang food bags which there were none. Well last night at the shelter, we found out that in fact there was a bear box. Apparently the folks in the shelter that night were keeping it for themselves and had it hidden under a sheet of Tyvek. Even though many of us asked about the cables, no one in the shelter said anything. They just left us to go hang bear bags in the cold driving rain.

An easy start to day - breakfast at hotel, shuttle back to the trail, 9ish start.  About 2 miles in we reached Fontana Dam. The largest dam east of the Mississippi. Spent a few minutes at the visitor center. The next mile or so the trail followed around the lake. Very pretty - especially since a beautiful day out.  We then entered the Smokies.  Hiking not to difficult just a slow grind up for most of the day.  I didn't realize it till the end of the day but we hiked back and forth between North Carolina and Tennessee.  Spring became less evident the more elevation gain, but still spring.  It was deceptively warm even with the breeze.   
Arrived at Russel Field shelter
at 4:30. We were surprised no one there.  4 other guys - thru hikers - who have been hiking more or less together the past 2 weeks arrived within 1/2 hour.  They all started a day or two before us.  They had some pretty funny stories of folks they have been seeing on the trail.

It has been great hiking with Will. Our pace is very similar. I'm faster on the flats and initially I was stronger on the uphills, but as he gets in better hiking shape I can tell he is getting faster going up. Seems like in the mornings I'm first up the hills/set the pace, but as the day progresses, roles switch. I guess youth rules. Will is also more curious about finding views and stopping to observe nature. I really appreciate that as I would have a tendency to go walking by. He makes the trip that much more enjoyable. 
So far no bear sighting but we did see a turkey and deer.  Will practically walked right into the turkey.  Does not speak well for his ability to spot a bear!
We arrived at the shelter around 4. Only one person was there. We claimed spots.  Within an hour a bunch of people arrived included the 4 guys we spent last night with at Russell Field Shelter. Fortunately we were able to give up our spots in the shelter and tent. By 6 was very crowded - shelter filled, 10 folks tenting.

An easy climb to clingmans dome but alas visibility about 10 feet so we spent a sum total of 10 seconds on top. Felt like we were going to get blown off the tower. 
A bunch of times we walked through some really cool pine forests. Everything was covered in the greenest moss you've ever seen. 
We hiked to Newfound gap and hitched hiked into Gatlinburg (15 miles) for lunch and resupply. Might tasty pizza.  Resupply was a big disappointment. The main market was 1.7 miles out of town so we hit local out fitter that did NOT cater to thru hikers.  We will be surviving on expensive cliff bars the next 2 - 4 days.  
We hitched back to Newfound gap for a three mile hike to icewater spring shelter. Will set a blistering pace. Either he was hungry or was afraid he would miss an podcast episode of Barstool!  We did stop for some outstanding views of the Smokies. We now appreciate why they are called that. A slightly hazy blue gray smoky mist that hangs all around the mountains and in the valleys. 
Since it is suppose to rain heavily in the morning we decided to spend a cozy night with 10-12 total strangers - one of which is inches from me - in the shelter. As I unpacked I realize I left my baggy with my money, license, credit cards, headlamp, tape, vitamins, earplugs ( basically my daily / nightly essentials) back at the resupply place in Gatlinburg.

Extremely windy, rainy and cold today. We initially contemplated doing 20 today, but sanity took over and we quit at 12. We ripped off the miles (and for the first time I had some ankle pain/issues - where did that come from??). Left after 8 and arrived at the shelter 12:30 - 12:45. Totally soaked. Amazing how fast unpleasant weather makes one hike. Many miles the trail was just stream. See pic - That's Will at the top of the trail. Yes we hiked in shorts and short sleeves, no rain gear. It does NOT keep you dry.  Besides when is the last time you got to run around in the rain, splashing in puddles, playing in a creek/stream, and stepping in mud?  We got to for the better part of 12 miles. 
Lots of ridge hiking today. We passed many spots where there must have been spectacular views - all we got was blasted by wind and rain. Someday we will have to come back and rehike the Smokies.
Again we were the first to arrive at the shelter. Had plenty of room to get into dry clothes, eat lunch, get settled. I put my long running pants on for the first time. Hikers started arriving an hour later. By 3 the Shelter was pretty much full. There will be some very disappointed hiker arriving later.  All looked extremely wet and weary. A few commented the toughest day they had on the trail so far.  I concur. 
Weather broke about 3:30. Sun out and wind decreased. Still chilly though.  The humanity started emerging from the shelter to enjoy the sun some of  the warmth it provided. Clothes lines were hung, dinners cooked.

Was wicked cold this morning. Probably in the upper 30s.  First few miles we hiked really fast to warm up. Our Fingers were killing us. For those of you who ski, the feeling you get when your toes or fingers get really cold then begin to thaw out / warm up and you get that pain as the warmth returns. 
We met  Concrete last night and spoke with him today. He holds 4 world record speed hiking records and is attempting to break one of the AT ones. He is training by walking the entire AT northbound, will rest for a week then head southbound to break the record. He will have to average just over 40.1 miles per day. Oh and by the way Will and I passed him 4 times!  OK right now he is just hiking at leisurely pace and will not amp up his trading pace till end of June. He is the second person we met on the trail who is going for a record this year. The other guy was doing a similar training approach. 
Even though it was cold, sun was out, it warmed up and turned into a beautiful day. Days like yesterday make days like today even more special. Got many great views of the Smokies.  We hiked about 11 miles to Cammerer Tower. Suppose to be the best 360 views of the Smokies and surrounding landscape. It did not disappoint!  We could see for I'm sure 100s of miles. 
5 miles Down hill to Davenport Gap and the exit of the Smokies was tough at least for me. Not steep but constant. I felt like my toes were coming out of the front of my shoes. Feet hurt knees hurt (I may never squat down to line up a putt again). For the first time I took some ibuprofen. 
As soon as we Exited the Smokies we ran Smack dab into a bit of civilization - I 40, cars and trucks. Only lasted about a mile. 
Stealth camped just outside a hostel.  Will made feeble attempt at making a fire. I did no better. We finally saw our first bear. Was crossing the road just down where we were camping. Was too quick to get phones/ cameras to snap a pic.","Tri-corner knob shelter

We then emerged from the woods just below Max Patch Summit. What a transformation experience I had at Max Patch. Max Patch is a summit that has been cleared and is maintained as bald. By far the most beautiful striking view of the Smokies and the Tennessee Valley. Words can't begin to describe the views and feelings it inspires. One of the gentleman who we have been kinda hiking with the past day or so, was move to tears when he reached the summit. Time seemed to stand still and an inner peace overcame me. We stayed for about a half hour just aborting the view and the feelings it inspired. The pic is looking up the Tennessee valley. BTW we hiked along the ridge line in the very back ground which included many views down into the valley. Please take a few minutes and google Max Patch - some stunning pictures which of course can only begin to capture the beauty.   The Smokies were never on my radar to visit, I sure want to come back and encourage those reading this to add to their list.  
After Max Patch a very pleasant hike through the woods along and crossing many streams. Time seemed stand still and we seemed to be walking along at a very peaceful pace - this directly as result of our time on Max.  It was later in day, so peaceful and relaxing. Kinda like going to beach very late afternoon / early evening in late August, early September.  Had our feet not been speaking crossly at us, we felt like we could have hiked for many more hours. 
Last 1.4 up to Walnut Mountain Shelter was tough especially since we had already done 19. 
We read on our guthooks app that Walnut Shelter and the surrounding tent sites had big issues with mice, so we got water and hiked on, fortunately down hill. Just short of a mile past the shelter we came across a great tent site. We were the only ones there so made camp, ate, hung bear bags (Will provided some entertainment for the night with his attempts at bear bagging) and crashed.

Very windy on the trail. Many trees, branches, twigs, etc on the trail. Will got hit by a falling branch - small one no damage. It was actually quite scary at times. 
Easy day of hiking. We made it to Hot Springs.  apparently 50% of thru hikers have left or leave by here. So another big milestone for us.
Some sort of festival this weekend so rooms were hard to come by. We have one tonight. Not yet tomorrow night (we decided to zero tomorrow as our last zero / day off the trail was 7 days ago). Weather report for next 2 day less than stellar.
Got lunch. Strange that people can still smoke at restaurants.  outside tables but still.
If you remember my post from Gatlinburg, I left my ""valuables"" ziplock bag at the local outfitter when we bought expensive clif bars to survive on.  Well it arrived safely at the outfitter here in Hot Springs.  Also an expected package from MK. Swedish fish was a major league hit!!!  Okey okey hand soap was a vey close second.
When we entered town saw Gretchen, Matt and Greg. We hiked with them for multiple days a week back. We were surprised to see them. They zeroed yesterday so we are just a day behind them. Will went to have a few beers with them. I stayed back as I'm sure the ""old"" guy would have only provided a few minutes of amusement before it became awkward.","Walnut Creek +.8

Get breakfast at the local, spend way too much and wreck the budget on resupplies,  town food and beer (trail towns very efficient at extracting hiker money) wait around doing wash, wait around for hotel room (which had yet to cleaned when we got it) wait around doing nothing all day. Had to replace my shoes. They were comfortable and I liked them, but they were falling apart. Second pair that's done so. Solomon will get an earful - as soon as I get reliable cell service.  
Yep that's a pic of Hot Springs. Pretty much captured it all - except for the dollar general. Trail runs right down through town - just to the left of the line of cars. 
As we are Zeroing today, I thought I would answer some of the questions I'm getting.  
First, I know I keep changing person narratives and verb tenses but trying to give both Will and my perspective and too difficult to go back and clean up. Guess that is blog / poetic license.
Second, drop me a line, tomgkenyon@gmail.com, or text +1.617.784.1915, if you have any questions. Always a pleasure to get some communication from friends and family. 
Do we have trail names yet? Not yet. I think because we are limiting time at shelters, haven't been with the same group of people for any length of time, and have yet to do something stupid/dumb/crazy/funny in front of the right person.  Apparently doing some stupid/dumb/crazy/funny is a prerequisite.  
In general how are you doing?So far all is going extremely well. We exited the Smokies and arrived at hot springs (mile 273) and are feeling great. Better than either of us thought we would be feeling at this time. We read that the first few weeks, everything would be sore. We followed advise from several experienced thru hikers and started off real slow. Looks like it paid off. 
How are your feet are doing?Both Will and I have been extremely fortunate.  A few very small blisters.  Will had some ankle swelling the first two weeks but it gradually faded. I had two days of a very minor ankle pain, but it went away. Ok, after 4 or 5 miles of downhill our feet and knees kill us, and it feels like our toes are coming out the front of our shoes.
How is the sleeping? Much better sleeping when tenting vs Shelters.  We have avoided Shelters as much as possible. Had to shelter through in the Smokies. Only one of the three nights it was not good. Way too many people in the shelter due to weather and I had Mr. Snore inches away.  
How has the Physical toll been?  So far limited/none. Granted some of the days and sections are very challenging but we are getting stronger each day. We are both injury free so far. On the advise of several experienced thru hikers, we started very slowly the first two week. Basically 7 to 8 miles a day, increased to 10. Now doing 15+. That will increase further as we leave the southern most part of the trail. Apparently the two ends of the trail, New Hampshire & maine, Georgia, North Carolina and through the Smokies - are some of the more difficult parts of the trail. Amazingly I've only taking  ibuprofen once so far. Will was taking some daily the first two weeks but just for his swollen ankle.   
Are you getting bored?  First week or so when we were done hiking so early - afternoons and evenings were a bit so. Due to norovirus we were doing our best to avoid crowds/shelters. Now that we are socializing more, no boredom. Views and hiking keep it at bay durning the day. 
What is your typical day like? We are still working on a routine even after almost a month. But typically up at 7, pack and eat. Off by 8ish. Lunch anywhere 11:30 to 1.  Camp/shelter 3 to 4. Dinner by 6, in ""bed"" by 8. I try to write most of my blog entries in bed. It is really hard to hold the phone - all 4.6 ounces - 12 inches above your head and type. The most annoying part of  the iPhone notes app is it keeps wanting to auto correct miles to mikes!!! Needless to say not good when writing about hiking 
Do we see many signs of civilization? Amazing no. Up till today almost no signs of civilization on the trail. We have gone into 3 towns to resupply and rest - but had to hitchhike 6 to 15 miles to do so. The last day in Smokies we saw the first real views of civilization in the distance. Today we are in the midst of civilization, Hot Springs NC, population 563 (2014).","Hot Springs

Very mature of them.  Just when you think they can't do anything more childish ... 
We still don't have a good handle on our food. Weight and cost per day too high. Seems to be an issue with how many Clif type and candy bars we have and in general too much extra food/meals. Clif type bars weigh a lot and cost a lot, especially if eating up to 6 a day. Ideally one should enter a town/resupply with no food (thus no food weight). We seem to be entering with a 1/2 to 1 day extra food.  Something to work on. 
Nothing exciting on today's trek. Was cold and damp, on and off drizzle.  Temps in the 40s?  Just like one of those cold clammy damp New England April days we all love so much. At times a cool misty/foggy atmosphere in the woods. Not too much up and down so we made pretty good time although we ran out of gas the last 3 to 4 miles. Just slogged it out. Sleet / hail when we set up camp. Ate quickly and jumped in sleeping bags to warm up. Guy at the shelter said it was suppose to get into the 30s tonight.
Couple of days ago when we were hiking into Hot Springs, I wrote about how windy it was, how Will got hit by a falling branch and we were kinda scared hiking. Well apparently they shut down that section of the trail for awhile that day due to the wind and danger.

Then I woke to cold hard ground. Did my mattress pad spring a leak? Will and I looked but nothing apparent. Let's see what tonight brings. Finding a small leak will be tough. Maybe there will be a big bath tub at the next hostel - Ha!
Put my right shoe on and it felt strange. Like I had it laced to tight. Despite several adjustments the top of my foot was killing me.  Hiked the First 5 miles in agony. Felt like some medieval torture device was affixed to my foot. At 5 miles stopped for water and Ibuprofen. Pain subsided a bit but hiked in pain all 18 miles. Could only go 60-70%. Other then my foot, felt great. 
Some amazing (again!) views from the balds we hiked over.  See pic

Started early today in case my foot bothered me again. First few miles it was a bother, then pain started fading. By late morning was doing pain free miles.  Kept the pace down a bit.  Right after lunch it was cranky for the first 1/2 mile or so but hey everything is cranky after a lunch break. Always seems to take me 15 minutes to get back up to speed.  If a big up hill after lunch, very painful to restart. I'll go a couple 100 yards and have to stop to catch my breath. Lesson learned - never eat lunch in/at a gap. Gap = hill! 


Was overcast all day. Very comfortable temps. Since the sun was not out, the woods, especially the mosses, were a very vivid green. Limited views today as the trees are really filling in. Even so some of the views not as dramatic as the past 4 weeks. Pic is the river just below Irwin. 


Again not many on the trail. 


Cruzed into Irwin, well Uncle Jonny's hostel and outfitter on the outskirts of town. Low and behold they had air mattresses!!!! And the guy there did a free swap out as he thought my mattress was defective!!!  I got an upgraded model with sleep number adjustments, mattress pad heater AND memory foam.

We've scored an occasional soda left in coolers on the side of the road and missed some of the bigger trail magic events by hours or a day. 
Had lunch on a nice bald. 
Last two days I mentioned issues with my air mattress. Now seems like Will maybe having the same problem. Hope these things are good for more than 30 nights sleeping! 
Passed a couple of guys on the trail. One was telling the other about the bear that visited his tent last night. He heard it sniffing around, it gently  pawed the side of his tent. Guess this bear stuff is real. 
Taught a guy how to hang his bear bag PCT, Pacific Crest Trail, style. He was amazed. He just couldn't figure out how I seemly got my bag to magically suspend itself in mid air. I'm quite the expert at it now. It will certainly come in handy when I get back home. For a beer, I'll teach you too. 
Hopefully this will be the last mention of my foot. Was much better this morning. Just felt like a small knot in my ankle. A bit of discomfort for the first few miles, rest of the day was just fine.

Ah. Nothing like starting the day with a breakfast of two cold pop tarts and a Jumbo honey bun!  Before the hike last time I had pop tarts was I think elementary school. Never ever had honey buns - and will never have them after the hike. Pop tarts are basically pieces parts after a day or so stuffed in a back pack. Honey buns are, shall I say, compacted smooched, flatten. It's all about the calories/ounce. Target is 130 calories per ounce times 32 ounces (target 2 lbs of food per day) = 4160 calories. But hard to get to 130 for each ounce.  (Just add olive oil to your nightly Chicken Ramon) We are probably somewhere shy of 3500 / day. 2 Pop tarts 420 calories, 1 Jumbo Honey Bun 590 calories = 1100 calories.

Can't believe we are just shy of 500 miles. Deep gap is at mile mark 495.3. 
We did pass on summiting Mount Rogers, but once we passed the spur trail to the top ran into lots of people out hiking around Rogers and the approach trails to Rogers. Tons of Boy Scouts out and about. Was a beautiful day. 
We made 500 miles at 11!!!  
Weather started to fall apart about noon. Storms moved in and rained and rained including lots of hale. The umbrellas were outstanding in the hale. Even with the umbrella I had to take refuse under trees now and then.  Will was ahead of me and we were planning to lunch in a meadow, but was poring rain so he kept going. I happened across a kiosk with about 10 scouts huddled beneath. I joined them and ate my lunch standing slightly protected from the wind and rain. After awhile the rain let up a bit so I moved on. After all Maine was not coming my way. 
Rain abated a bit while I walked then finally stopped late in the afternoon. Met up with Will at Hurricane Shelter. We decided to spend the night in the shelter as only one other person was there and more rain expected. We've heard it is suppose to rain most of tomorrow.

Stopped on the side of the trail for lunch. Will caught up with me just after I finished lunch (he was about 10 minutes behind me, he decided to have lunch earlier than me) 
About 1 it started to rain again. Light rain. Instead of pulling out my rain jacket, out came the trusty umbrella. Much cooler to hike with the umbrella vs. rain jacket.

Although Will and I are hiking together, we are doing so independently. By that I mean we share time and experiences but no gear, food or expenses (ok occasionally I pick up the tab for a beer or ice cream). We use Venmo all the time to settle bills/expresses.  Well back in Damascus, Will tried to send me money  and I got  ""Will Kenyon's payment to you is in review by our compliance team. We'll review it within 48 hours. Then, you'll see the funds in your balance or we will email you if we are unable to process it. We have notified Will Kenyon about the review already.""  Will received something similar. You can tag transactions with a description. He used Damascus . They thought he was sending money to Syria!  I did eventually get the funds. 
We got up and had a fantastic breakfast (just kidding) at the econo lodge. Weather was overcast with forecast of on and off rain. We did a small resupply at Walmart. Wow you forget how inexpensive stuff is at Walmart. Grabbed a sandwich at a local lunch place, hitched back to the trail (took awhile for a ride) and started hiking about 12:30. 
I did not have a good first 1/2 of the day hiking. For some reason was feeling really hungry, felt like was moving slowly and was feeling a bit cranky. It Was overcast and the trail was rocky. Was a 5 out of 10. About two hours in I rounded a corner and there was Will at an overlook with a nice view of the rolling southern Virginia hills.  Soon after that the sun came out, the trail flattened and it became the most perfect hiking experience.  We hiked through woods, fields and pastures. From all the rain the past few days, the path was nice and soft. Temps must have been in the low to mid 70s. Day went from being a 5 out of 10 to a 12 out of 10. We both commented one of the nicest few hours of hiking of the trip. To top it all off at the Settlers museum  (just south of Atkins ) was one of the best trail magic from the local church inside a old one room school house.

I've been asked what is the one thing I miss most. Easy. ICE CREAM! And you thought I would say beer. Actually friends and family. Yes meeting lots of people on the trail, hiking with Will, but being away from my wife, family and friends is very difficult. I thought about hiking the AT for many years but the number one reason I did not was I did not want to go off by myself for 5 to 6 months. I enjoy the occasional emails from friends so please drop me a line from time to time and let me know what you're up to.
Rain abated just as I left camp. A bit of easy uphill to start the day. Remained overcast and rain threatened. Stopped by a creek for lunch. A nasty uphill section right after lunch and light rain started. Made the shelter by 2, Will rolled in about 2:30 (he slept in a bit this morning as we had a short day). We pitched tents in a light rain and for the first time both took naps as there was nothing to do in the rain. The shelter was small, packed, and stunk of wet hiker humanity (slightly worse than wet old dogs) so we avoided it. 
Still raining after naps. Waited awhile to see if the rain would let up so I could make dinner. At 6:30 I made the call to do a big no no and make dinner in the tent. Not the smartest thing to fire up the stove in the vestibule .  Biggest issue would be burning some sort of hole in the rain fly. As you can imagine, Not good to have a hole in your fly when raining out. Successfully made dinner, ate, ""cleaned up"", hung the bear bag. In bed early so I'm sure I'll be up early itching to go.

I found them! 
It's a bit daunting when you are given a location to pick up two hikers on the AT in the middle of rural Virginia.  We determined the time and date for our meeting. The best Will could do was give me coordinates,  not an address. Who knew Google Maps could direct me right to the very spot! And there they were! 
I now know what a zero day entails.  Eating,  laundry,  eating,  buying 4 days of food, more eating.   And lots of relaxing. 
Here are some other things I learned spending the day off with these two. If you are already soaked,  don't bother using the umbrella.  Spring water is much preferred to town  water.  You can add a pouch of tuna to your ramen noodles and not even taste it.  And Will's trail name is La- Z- Boy. The thing he missed the most was sitting in a chair so he bought a trail chair,  now a cherished possession!
Back to the trail tomorrow.  I offered to drive them a few miles north so they could skip ahead.  Who would know?  But they adamantly agreed -  back to where I picked them up.  They don't want to miss a step.  Now, where are those coordinates??","VA 723

Late in the day we had to load up on water as none for a 20 mile stretch due to the superfund site just outside Lehigh Gap / Palmerton and just  no water sites. We were excited to carry an extra 6 lbs of water. 
As soon as we crossed the Lehigh river a significant uphill climb. 1000 feet in 1.3 miles, 800 of which  in 3/4 of mile (btw for you Boston/MA folks the John Hancock tower is 790 feet) I'm sure the steepest we've done so far.  Parts were absolutely terrifying. Had to climb on hands and knees, sometimes on stomach, at times literally straight up and over boulders. Most of the way through wet slippery rocks/boulders. No way could I have done it going down. Both Haze and I though so dangerous that it should not be part of the trail and irresponsible of the AT to have it be a section.  If you google top 10 most difficult hikes/sections/climbs on the AT, this section is listed. 
After the climb did a few miles and stealth camped on a ridge.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter (1240.0)

Morning hiking wasn't so bad. Around 1 we broke for lunch at a cross road. Laid out our tents and stuff to dry on the road.  Big time hiker trash. 
Hiking after lunch into Wind Gap was difficult. 7.5 miles of nothing but rock. Not much elevation gain, just pounding and pounding of rocks for hours on end. 
Made it to the highway in one piece and quickly hitched a ride to the hotel. Person was nice enough to let us stop and get some Beer. 
Dinner at a local pizza joint. 
Cab service in Wind Gap not good. Waited 45 minutes for a cab to the pizza joint, an hour for the return. Had we known we would have walked as less than a mile both ways.","stealth camp (1261.6)

Met Haze's step son who was  hiking with us today. We had a good BIG breakfast at the  Wind Gap diner then off for the final miles in PA.  We slack packed (left almost all our gear in the car). WOW what a difference. Was able to fly over the rocks without the extra weight.  Some rocky sections and a few small boulder fields but overall not as bad as the past week has been. We heard the rocks continue into NJ but for less than 5 miles.  Bet you'll be glad to not read about rocks anymore. 
Entered Delaware Water Gap and encountered a nice trail magic event. Hot dogs, sodas, etc.  Pitched tents on the grounds of a local church, got 3 days resupply at Walmart, then burgers and beer at a local.

Also many people out hiking, lots of views from the ridge line, which we hiked for most of the day, that distracted us from the rocks. As the day progressed they seem to diminish. Sunfish pond, above, was beautiful. Amazing but the very first pond we passed by on the AT. Some lakes, but Haze and I can think of no other ponds.  
Was sunny low 80's and low humidity.  
Camped at a tent site. First time the mosquitoes were out in force. Was good to dive into the tent in the earlier side.

Up and on our way a bit after 7. Some ""easier"" hiking and good views in the morning. By lunch/noon, somehow we only made 10 miles. Could not figure out why as were we're moving along (obviously not). 
Afternoon hiking was tough. PA rocks made a guest appearance.  Caught many of the thru hikers off guard. We all were expecting them to be pretty much gone by now. 
Arrived at High Point State Park a bit before 6. Bam! Trail magic. Taylor pork roll sandwiches and cokes!
So how many thru hikers are passing through on a given day?  The folks providing trail magic - and they set up early this morning - said we were around 40 so far. And I know some of the young bucks will we passing through over the next couple of hours. The young bucks seem to start later in the morning and finish later in the day.

Made decent time and crossed into NY just before noon. 
Lots of ridge hiking today. Good thing it wasn't overly hot (low to mid 80's?) and partially sunny. Had it been in the 90's and full sun, we would have absolutely melted as lots of hiking on the exposed ridges. Lots of small ups and downs and rock scrambles so was fun hiking 
Made it to an ice cream place about 4. I had 2 large ice creams and a soda. Hung out till about 5:30 with a few other thru hikers. We kept the hiker trash pretty contained as it was a respectable place. 
2 easy miles into camp. 
Double WOW
One. at least 25 tents set up. Haven't seen this much activity since the first few weeks on the trail. A mini bubble that is hiking together. Sounds like most came from the shelter 12 back. Our plan is to do 19 to 22 tomorrow so hopefully we'll leave'em in our dust
Two. Mosquitos on steroids at this site. Not only tons but aggressive little critters. Set up my tent and dove right in.  Not eating tonight and the plan is to get out of dodge pronto tomorrow morning and eat breakfast on the trail. 
We have had to keep a close eye on water. Many sources now dry or not very appealing. Carrying more water. Also shelters and stealth camping sites far less frequent.  Makes planning far more important and doing the miles we want more difficult.

Endless ups and downs, no flat terrain. Each up and down was short but very steep and usually included scrambling over rocks/ mini cliff face. Also was hot and extremely humid. Had to take multiple breaks.  Natural water was in short supply, good thing several places where people left out gallon jugs of water. At one location at least 40 jugs. Was it ever needed!
Got to do the ""Lemon Squeeze"". See pic. Had to take the pack off, toss it up on the right, turn sidewise to climb out. Was fun. 
Last 2 days of hiking are taking a toll. One of the web sites / planning tools I'm using said the 44 miles from Vernon NJ/RT   94 (where we camped 2 nights ago) to Bear Mt. NY ""are difficult"". I'll say. Today was in the top 5, if not 3, of most difficult days so far.  Bear Mountain is 12.7 from here.   
14.9 to Fort Montgomery where we plan to get a hotel room to dry out and resupply. Quest is can we do 14.9 tomorrow???","Wildcat Shelter (1374.1)

Yesterday probably drank well over 2 gallons of water, today just under 2 litters. 
Hiking finally got back to normal. We made 14 miles by 2, called a cab into yet another substandard overpriced hotel/motel. But hey, showers and a place to let your stuff dry out is  priceless these days.

Not the best camping sites.

Basically had a few non thru hiker camping items. I did score a ""buy one get one free"" gator aid (giant size!). That was certainly needed as again very hot and humid. Hiking and climbs have not been difficult but the heat and humidity makes it a challenge.  Hard to keep hydrated. Also have to watch for heat exhaustion.  I wash my shirt out and sponge off when we come to streams.  That helps lots.  
After Kent an ""nice"" climb up and down then a few miles of actual flat hiking alongside the Housatonic River.

Last 2 days the mini group of 5 has been three- myself, yoda and weatherman. Haze dropped back due to foot issues, Pablo had to wait for a delivery in the last town. 
Two huge milestones today. 1500 miles completed and entered MA!!!
Last miles of CT were easy except a challenging last .3 from the top of Bear Mt into MA. Was a steep and rocky descent in a short period of time.  Required lots of attention!  You know it's tough when you are sweating twice as much going down as up.
