Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576264,"This is my first entry for 2017.  After AT hikes in 2014, 2015 and 2016 starting at Springer Mountain, GA and constantly going further north, I have completed 1041 miles of the AT.  Planning a 9/13 start from Harpers Ferry, WV simply because it is an easy destination to get to via AMTRAK.  The first two days will be over familiar territory that I hiked last fall before a medical emergency caused my trek to end.  A hiking buddy I met in 2014, Trudger (from the country of Peru and sometimes NY state) will join me for about the first 2 weeks.
This is the first of a required 3 entries that must be completed before trail Journals will have the journal available for public viewing.",,View Entry,"Aug 27, Sun",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576355,"This is the 2nd of 3 required entries before my journal will show to y'all.  It was a productive day today.  First went for a 10.9 mile training hike in Hitchcock Woods.  I bumped up my pack weight to 36 pounds by adding another towel wrapped brick.  This should be (hopefully) above my real weight as I start my fall hike.  Having a cooling in weather here in SC.  Sure was nice to start out at 68 degrees and finish at 74 degrees(verses recent starts at near 73 and reaching about 85).  And the humidity was not near 100% and there was a nice breeze.  Hallaluah!!!
After getting cleaned up and having lunch, I took my sleeping bags to a laundromat to get them nice and fresh smelling. And to top it off, visited Kroger to get at least most of my initial food supplies.  I'm starting out without a stove, like I did last year.  Plan is to have it mailed to me as the weather gets colder.
Some time ago, my wonderful wife, Wendy stopped driving to drop me off and/or pick me up from hikes.  This was understandable since I was getting further and further away from home.  We have however, reached a compromise for this trip.  She is going to drive me to Greenville, SC to drop me off at an AMTRAK station.  It is only about a 2.5 hour drive.  With a transfer in Washington DC, I'll ride the rails directly to downtown Harpers Ferry.  Initially I was going to do the usual one way rental car.  But, it was going to be over $400 and AMTRAK is only $86.  A no-brainer.
Already have my AMTRAK ticket for a 9/11 departure, arrival in Harpers Ferry 9/12 and start hiking 9/13.",,View Entry,"Aug 28, Mon",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576470,"This is my 3rd entry, that means it will now show up in the Trail Journals web site.  Yesterday did another 8 training miles in Hitchcock Woods with a 36 pound backpack.  This is the first time in this training period I went out on consecutive days.  Was a little more fatigued; but, in a good way.  Todays pic is a routine stop in my training hikes.  A home in Foxchase with a stable in their backyard, including this handy little seat...a rarity even in local woods.

Less than 2 weeks now before my departure.   Each day get tasks done off of my ""to do"" list.",,View Entry,"Aug 30, Wed",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577265,"Sorry to say I will not be going on a hike this fall after all.  Had a medical test done yesterday and spoke with the doctor today about it.  As a result, he recommends that I not go out on my planned hike.I am very disappointed!  But, have to respect the doctors advice until we know more about the situation.Achin",,View Entry,"Sep 08, Fri",0
