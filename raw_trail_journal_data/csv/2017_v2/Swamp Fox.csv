Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553173,"Yesterday I took a brief hike on the Mattatuck Trail near Wolcott, CT. The route took me alongside the Mad River, on lightly packed snow, under hemlocks. It was very pleasant, which is why I chose it. The temperature was in the low 20's, but soon warmed up to the low 30's. I started out wearing a normal winter jacket, but soon took it off and was quite comfortable in a lightweight down jacket from LL Bean, 850 fill. My wife gave me my first one last year, but it was silver colored and after I had done over 600 miles carrying or wearing it, grease became an issue as far as appearance. The new one is black.On my way back, I met an old man, out walking his dogs. Like any other hiker, he was concerned about trail conditions, in this case, whether it was slippery enough to make falls an issue. I told him, I'm 69 and there was one place where I held onto the trees a bit, but otherwise it's OK. We do the best we can.I spent much of my hike musing about what I've learned about human nature as the sorry spectacle of the Trump candidacy and transition has unfolded. The whole thing brings out the worst in everybody, and for me it has been a serious threat to serenity. Hence the walk in the woods.We have all these on-line forums, where trolls enjoy the privilege of anonymity and pseudonimity and vent their destructive and anti-social attitudes to the fullest. Ideologues strut their stuff: it's considered hip to be bigoted, opinionated, intransigent and aggressively stupid. A former hiking companion emailed me several items that I found offensive. We hiked together several days late last summer, and mutually agreed to leave his particular version of conservatism and my liberal convictions aside and concentrate on enjoying the hike. It was a very pleasant experience and we had agreed to hike together again this year, but apparently Trump's victory emboldened him to take the attitude he would send me this garbage just to see if he could aggravate me. Trump's victory has done that: it's now legitimate, somehow, to flaunt prejudice and bigotry. The first email, I changed the subject. The second, I replied with a link to something constructive I had posted. He never clicked on it. The third, I informed him I had had enough of his dog-whistle conservatism and severed the relationship. We should be getting together in small groups and talking about our visions for this country, hammering out an understanding of what we want to provide each other as citizens and how it is to be paid for. Instead think tanks grind out comfort food for ideologues, who email it back and forth to each other and vow to impose their will on the country by any means possible. Soon enough we will have the lunatics in charge of the asylum. Meanwhile the country is becoming an oligarchy.As for me, I have a journey to complete.",,Staying in Shape,"Jan 11, Wed",0
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553200,"Getting ready to start serious hiking in the Spring, I've been working on applying technology to improve fitness. MapMyHike is a GPS program that provides useful data to track distance hiked, elevation gained, pace, etc. It has the ability, as shown,to combine a GPS track with a Topographic map. The route shown is in Connecticut, near Lake Compounce, the site of an amusement park. Exporting the track as a csv file, the program includes accumulated distance, elevation gain and loss. On this particular hike, as an out and back it was half uphill, and half downhill. Dividing accumulated elevation gain by half of the total distance, the average uphill grade works out to 11%. Or it could be stated as a ratio, 9:1, nine feet sideways for every foot up. Subjectively, the route is steep in places.I have this tendency to prefer softer, easier hikes, which can be overcome by developing a statistic of this type for various local routes and then selecting enough of the more difficult ones to give myself a workout. I got a Fitbit for Christmas, and was able to pair it with my phone. As such, it has access to GPS, so that I can get a track with heartrate data included. Again, this is about assessing the difficulty of a hike, and the expected effect on fitness. The included software estimates resting and maximum heartrates, and divides the distance between them into zones. So far I find that I spend very little time at the ""cardio"" level and almost none at the ""peak"". Mostly ""fat burn"". There's a certain amount of guidance out there on the internet, about how much time at what heart rate is beneficial, but as far as I'm concerned we're all an experiment of one on this type of stuff. What has worked for me in the past is to select routes that have a long grade, steep enough to get me into the cardio zone, and then keep my pace, expressed in min/mile, under 20. It's also possible to estimate VO2 max, a statistic aimed at how much oxygen the system can process, which is a measure of fitness. The easiest way is to walk a mile as fast as you can and then take your pulse, easy to do if you have Fitbit. From there online there are estimators that will give you your VO2 max. Mine works out to 30.3, average for a man my age.This type of stuff can be dangerous, lure you into a bunch of naval gazing around fitness topics. It can also get you into open-ended self-improvement and personal bests, which will lead you to injury. I don't plan to take my Fitbit with me on the AT. The last thing I need to do is stop in the middle of some steep climb, check my pulse, discover it's over the max, and panic about over-exertion. Simple common sense will do, to pause and rest when you need it.What I do is, when I start to huff and puff like an old hit or miss engine, is I stop and do 7/11 breathing, inhale for a count of 7 and exhale for 11. Then when my breathing calms down, I continue my hike. It's going to rain today, so I plan to stay close to home, do a few miles with a rain jacket on, then spend some time on the internet, blogging and checking my stocks.",,Applying Technology,"Jan 12, Thu",0
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553556,"Today's hike was a tough one, with over 2,000 feet total ascent and one section that has been described as treacherous. The AT formerly ran through Macedonia Brook State Park, before it was rerouted, and the Topographic Map labels it at several points. So going over Cobble Mountain I was on the old AT for a little while. The last time I did this hike was in the Fall of 2012, while training for an attempted through hike in 2013. At the time, I wasn't in that good shape and at about mile 4.5 (of 6.6) I bailed out. I reached a point where the trail ahead of me was very steep, and a beautiful leaf covered gravel road beckoned me down off the trail. I yielded to temptation. This time I planned on doing better, and went past the bailout point and on up a very steep section. A young couple passed me going the other way, obviously enjoying their hike. Soon I hit a place where I couldn't figure out how to climb it. I can't do a chin-up anymore, and it looked like I would have to lift myself by the strength of my arms. Finally I noticed a foothold that was barely adequate, and got up and over the obstacle. I had to put my knee down on some rock, painful, and finally crawled a few feet before I could stand back up. Then there was another spot, where it was fingers don't fail me now. There were two sections that MapMyHike classifies as category 4 and 5, meaning they are difficult enough to talk about. This route is a good one for training purposes, and has views that make it enjoyable in its own right. Noting the 2,000 feet total ascent, doing it twice in one day would verify that I can do Katahdin, which has about 4,500. I drove past the current AT twice, on the road that leads past Kent School and down into the town. Kent has a reputation of not being hiker-friendly, partly because of a woman in the laundromat, who didn't like to have hikers in the place. The area is well-to-do, and while the houses aren't pretentious, there is a lot of old New England charm, stone walls all over the place, babbling brooks, old dams, etc. Very pleasant.",,Hiking the Former Route of the AT,"Jan 20, Fri",0
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553990,"As a section hiker, I don't have trail legs, except maybe toward the end of last year when I did over 600 miles. I lose ground over the winter, and in the past I would work myself into shape during the first few outings. That isn't going to work this year: all I have left is 100 miles in Virginia and in ME the 100 Mile Wilderness and Katahdin. Katahdin is a climb of 4,200 feet, of which 3,200 are steep. Going back over the various ""hardest parts"" of the AT, such as the Kinsmans, the Wildcats, Mahoosuc Notch and Arm, and Mount Bigelow, I can form an impression of how much to train for Katahdin. 
The Wildcats after studying the profile the cumulative climb is about 2,900 feet, allowing about 500 feet for the low points between the peaks. I did that with a 30 lb pack, but it was a struggle. On Katahdin I will just have a day pack, and after adjusting for the lighter weight, the two climbs are roughly equivalent. Later last year I did Mount Bigelow, which is more difficult based on cumulative feet of climb, again carrying a full pack, without excessive fatigue. I went slowly the next day. So I need to be at peak fitness before I do Katahdin.
Elevation change is subject to various interpretations. The easiest way is to think of it as the difference between the high and low point of the day. But if you do two mountains a cumulative figure is more useful. Steepness is frequently expressed as a percentage, although degrees would be equally logical. Looking at the ratio of sideways to up, anything over 5:1 or 20% is steep. 
Katahdin is doesn't have meaningful downhill sections, and is steep before you hit the Tablelands. 
I found a way to locate the steepest hikes I do in Connecticut. Briefly, the MapMyHike software provides an estimate of calories burned, which can be divided by miles to get a calories/mile figure. It correlates very well with steepness. So I downloaded a spreadsheet containing the data on my hikes, did the calories/mile calculation, and sorted. The data included a link for each hike, so I can look them up as far as where they're located, cumulative feet climbed, etc. 
I found a schedule for training for a marathon, and adapted it to work by cumulative feet of climb rather than miles. Before going to Katahdin, by this line of thinking, I need to be able to do a 3,200 foot climb as part of a week totaling 5,800 feet. From where I am, I would need to do progressively more feet climbed for about 6 weeks to reach that point. Doing what I have left in VA and then the 100 mile wilderness could be part of the training. 
So for the rest of the winter I will plan to do about 3,400 feet per week, to stay within striking distance of the level of fitness required to do Katahdin. 
Just an afterthought, after climbing Katahdin, I will have to get back down.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Tue",0
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562359,"This journal covers two days. I parked at Route 55 and headed north, up and over Ten Mile Hill, to the Ten Mile River Shelter, where I spent the night. It's a nice shelter, with a pump for water, at the junction of the Ten Mile River and the Housatonic. It was as a very short day, about two miles,  my first outing for the year and the first time I've hiked with a full pack. I've done this route several times: it's pleasant but nothing remarkable. In the morning the trail went along beside the Housatonic River for several miles, over a hill, some road-walk, then some rougher terrain. There's a lot of up and down, the profile doesn't look that hard, but I found it tiring. It was drizzling most of the day, cool and good hiking weather. The rocks were slippery and I fell twice, a few scrapes and bruises. There were a few thru hikers, to include a young couple who had started in February and were doing 25 mile days. We chatted for a few minutes, then they vanished down the trail, while I went along at my own pace to complete my 8 miles.  I shared the Mt. Algo Shelter with Edward, a newbie, with the typical overweight pack and cotton clothing. He had exploded his pack, and was in the process of sending everything he didn't need home, from the PO in nearby Kent. He had a bad blister, from leather boots, and was taking a zero to let it heal before continuing his hike. Long distance hiking has a learning curve, and he was talking to people and figuring it out OK. The shelter is close to route 341, which leads to Kent. I thought briefly of heading down to the Fife and Drum for dinner, but stayed put and ate trail food.","Route 55

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562407,"This entry covers two days: a full day to the Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter and then a few miles the second day to Dawn Hill Road. There were a number of views, the Connecticut countryside was turning a light green color as the leaves came out, very pretty but it didn't photograph well. The main feature was yhe descent of St. John's Ledges, very steep and bad footing due to a large amount of dried oak leaves, which are very slippery. There was very little breeze, and the UVI hit 7 during the day. The heat was oppressive going down with the afternoon sun heating the rocks. Memory plays tricks on you. The last time I did the section, St. John's Ledges was shockingly steep. I remember looking down over the edge and asking myself if I was really going to go down that thing, and then thinking it was too far to turn back so I didn't have a choice. Once I started, it was easy, handholds where you needed them and no situations that required any thought before proceeding. So this time around it didn't seem that steep, but I got into a number of situations including one where my boot got wedged between the rocks and it took some effort to force it through so I could go forward. I pitched my pack and poles down once, to avoid being encumbered when lowering myself with my arms. Once down from the ledges, I strolled along a road and stopped at a stream to treat some water. I had lost a plastic bag with a couple of pages from the AWOL book, and a fellow hiker carried it forward and presented it to me. I was pleased, my phone was running low and I was trying not to use it, to check Guthook's. We become so dependent on our phones, but I like to carry a paper backup. From there it was flat-landing to Stewart Hollow, where I had the shelter to myself while two hikers tented nearby. One of them, I didn't catch his name, was a newbie, he came up to the shelter doing the survival shuffle, carrying a 60 pound back and wearing jeans. The other was Glen, more experience and he has a lady friend who is thru-hiking this year. He had a new tent he wanted to try out. In the morning they both came over and we got into a political discussion. I'm a liberal, Glen is a libertarian, and the other fellow had a mixture of common complaints and alternate facts. These type of discussions on-line can be aggravating and get down to a pretty low level, but face to face and with the common bond as hikers we had a spirited discussion. One view we all shared was that the elite in this country are running it for their own benefit and the rest of us are not getting much traction on changing things. From there is was a stroll along the river, then a meadow walk on some old farmland the ATC owns and keeps it mowed to maintain the agricultural flavor of this section of the trail. I did a short uphill to Dawn Hill Road, where I ended the hike and headed down to Cornwall Bridge, where there is a parking area and a gas station. I got a cup of real coffee and some junky pastry, then called for a shuttle. Unfortunately none was available. Or fortunately, I stuck out my thumb and got a ride direct to my car within about 5 minutes. Kent being an expensive town, I had visions of standing there for hours watching the occasional late-model German-made car or SUV go by. But an elderly gentleman picked me up and drove me back to my car, very generous of him. On the way home, I stopped at the Gooseboro Drive-in, a seasonal business and well-known locally. The parking lot was full of cars, so I stopped and had a famous burger, way better than McDonald's. As a hiker it's important to eat large quantities of real food when the opportunity presents itself.","Mt. Algo Shelter

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563640,It rained heavily the night after I arrived at the Four Pines Hostel. So I took a zero before starting to hike.Joe dropped me off at 630 where I ended last year. From there it was through fields to the Keffer Oak. There wasn't anyone there to take a picture of me at the landmark so I took one looking up through the branches.At one point the trail went through an area loaded with cairns. Clearing the rocks they piled them up instead of building walls. A lot of work and now the fields have reverted to woodlands.I tented near the shelter and joined the group at the picnic table for supper and hanging around the fire. Some of them were smoking weed but just sociable like having a few beers. I turned in early and slept soundly.,"VA 630

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563659,"The main feature of the day was the Audie Murphy Memorial. Leading up to it the trail runs on an old road that is kept mowed and grassy. I stopped and reflected a moment and left a coin. I didn't pass the physical during the Viet Nam War, for which I was grateful. Many of us opposed that war, but I'm grateful to those who have served in any of our wars.The hike turned into a tough ridge walk, up and over many rocky sections. I was tired and the cold wind didn't let up for hours.Pogo suggested I collect water about a half mile from the shelter, which I did, five liters. The shelter is downhill a ways from the trail, but there are campsites part way down. I tented under some pines. After supper I joined a group around their fire, not neglecting to bring some dead pine as fuel. The water is downhill steep from the shelter so I was glad I carried it in.It rained a bit and I turned in early to stay out of it. Also to get plenty of sleep - the terrain is more difficult than the profile.","Niday Shelter

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563681,"The feature of the day was the Dragon's Tooth. I didn't climb it as I was tired and it was crowded.
The hike up to that point had a lot of flowers - pink lady slipper, lily of the valley, trilliums, devil's paintbrush. The terrain was rough and I was tired.
The descent from Dragon's Tooth is steep. At one point there is a traverse alongside an 80° slope with a 10 foot drop to the other side, but the route is clear. I pitched my pack and poles.
After the descent it was pleasant, Rhodo and Pitch Pine. I got a ride to the hostel, 0.3 miles but I thought it was 1.4. Drove to Denny's for a heavy meal then hung around the hostel, lights out at 10:00.","Pickle Branch Shelter

There was some pasture walking and  lunch break at the parking lot for McAfee's Knob. Members of the RATC were there steering hikers away from the fire road. It's an alternate and easier route, but was under construction with bulldozers. Many day hikers passed me in both directions.I stayed at the Catawba Mountain Shelter which is about 2 miles from the Knob. The other occupant was from Quebec and spoke very little English. He had trouble with his propane burner so I let him use mine. His was an MSR, supposed to work with any canister.He dined on ramen noodles.

The hiker from Quebec was still sleeping soundly.Heading for McAfee the last few days there was much discussion of watching the sunrise, getting fabulous photos, etc. It could have been the weather, but I had the place to myself. I struck the iconic pose - poles at the ready, pack on my back, gazing out on the world below. The effect of the sun on the clouds, fog and mist was extraordinary - check out the photos. The rock formations are interesting. The softer material wrathers out leaving blocks separated by channels. I was tempted to explore but restrained the urge in the interest of energy conservation.From there it was on to Tinker's Cliffs, also very scenic with numerous fine views.I arrived at Lambert's Meadow Shelter mid afternoon, claimed a spot, and spent the rest of the afternoon talking to hikers as they stopped by. Many of them intended to continue on to Daleville. An elderly couple were taking a zero in place. The man was exhausted and was napping when I arrived. He kept his sense of humor and joked that he was through hiking, as in finished. Smeagol had helped them considerably by carrying some of their gear to get them to the shelter.There was some friction when a late arrival thought someone should surrender their spot since he didn't have a tent with him and rain was expected. It doesn't work that way. After the entitled one left we talked a while and turned in before hiker midnight.","Catawba Mountain Shelter

I was on the trail by 7:00 and made good time until it turned into a rough and rocky ridge walk.I met a ridge runner and we discussed camping rules in the ""pristine"" wilderness. It's technically illegal on this section, but honored in the breach. I saw numerous stealth sites, none heavily used.His advice was to create a new site if you had to tent. I think it's better to use existing. He said it was important not to poop on the trail. I told him I went down the powerlines a bit and pulled the old pick a rock ploy. Not good enough in his opinion. The descent into Daleville was steep. The last half mile was marshy and lots of mosquitoes. I checked in to the HoJo, showered, and got a large late lunch at Shoney's. Supper was also late, a big Chef's Salad. Talked a bit with some fellow hikers at the motel but they were getting wasted so I went to bed at a reasonable hour.","Lambert Meadows Shelter

I did laundry and resupply before I left Daleville, and arranged a shuttle with Theresa Witcher, to take me back to Daleville to continue the hike. Continental breakfast was a lot of hiker type pastries and freshly brewed coffee. I asked Theresa to take two German hikers up to Jennings Creek (5 miles) as an addition which she did. I was back in Daleville and hiking by 8:30.The climb out of town was leniently graded, switchbacked and stairstepped. I walked in stile, through pastures. At noon I stopped at a shelter for lunch. One hiker there, Little Cards. After that there was a leisurely downhill. I stopped hiking mid afternoon and set up my tent at Curry Creek. It's an unofficial site but well used. Kiwi Legs stopped by and we talked for a while. She came to the US from New Zealand anout 20 years ago and is a very strong hiker.

The uphills were on easy grades and the trail was lined with Rhododendron and Mountain Laurel in bloom. After a few miles I stopped at Wilson Creek Shelter for second breakfast and to use the privy. A person in black hiked in, greeted me and checked the journal. She left with a sad look, perhaps she had lost track of a friend. From there it was a pleasant stroll to Black Horse Gap, where I stopped for lunch. At that point the trail starts to run parallel to the Blue Ridge Parkway, which it crosses from time to time at various overlooks. The trees have been cut back at the overlooks and the views were impressive. When Jeanne and I drove along here in 2013 all the views were obscured by trees.I started to struggle on the uphills and lost the ability to enjoy my surroundings. There was a woman doing fantastic trail magic at an overlook a few miles from Bobletts Gap Shelter which was my goal for the day. She had fruits, snacks, pastries, gatorade and foot long subs. I ate part of one and packed the rest out for supper. Noticing that I was tired she offerred to shuttle me forward a few miles. I was grateful for the offer and trail magic, but decided to hike on to my destination. I'm a purist and intend to pass every blaze. At the shelter I claimed a place and ate supper. A large group of young thru-hikers who had been together since early in their hike came in. Soon there were no tentsites left. They talked until hiker midnight, jobs, apartments, student debt, legalized marijuana and also memories of their hike so far. Talking to Jeanne she suggested I take a double zero as I was sounding tired.

My young sheltermates from last night passed me at regular intervals.Aftter some overlooks the trail headed down for Jennings Creek. Extended downhills can be tiring and I went slowly. There's a swimming hole at the creek, which many were looking forward to. I was looking forward to a nice warm shower. At the parking area I called Dave Watts for a shuttle to the Wattstull Inn. It's vintage but clean and very well maintained. The nearby Foot Of The Mountain restaurant is closed Monday so I drove through Buchanon to the North Star which has good homestyle fare.

The pool itself is very recent and replaces one that had deteriorated over the years. The associated Foot Of The Mountain Restaurant has good food but is not open on Monday or Tuesday, although the additional days may be added in the future. Continental breakfast consists of freshly brewed coffee and an abundance of snack foods of the type that appeal to hikers.I had breakfast and supper at The North Star Restaurant, a few miles down the road. Laid back atmosphere, customers clearng the tables, serving themselves coffee, setting the tables for themselves, at times. At breakfast the round table was occupied by the usual old boys club, with much joking and kidding. I revised my expectations for mileage to compensate for the heat, long clumbs and lack of conditioning. Tomorrow I spot my car at Thunder Ridge parking and Dave shuttles me back to Jennings Creek. It's 15 miles which I plan to do over 2 days with a light pack. I spent some time talking to Dave and Barbara, a couple section-hiking the same part I'm on but they are SoBo.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565255,"I left my car at Thunder Ridge Parking and Dave took me back to Jennings Creek by VA 614, the same road that the Inn is on. It's steep, narrow and winding, used by bear hunters among others. They have one or more dogs in cages on the back of their pickups, and good hunters (those with the best dogs) may attract a convoy. There can be a lot of dogs at the tree. Dave showed me a video of a bear walking up to him on a tree stand and actually coming up the ladder a ways. In Maine they hunt bear over bait, I don't know what the law is in Virginia. 
There was also a small structure similar to one I saw while descending to Dennis Cove Road in Tennessee. Apparently when the land was taken by imminent domain some of the structures were left behind. A pity care wasn't taken to preserve some of them, to see how people actually lived in the mountains. 
I lost my hat and earned 0.4 bonus miles retrieving it. Being bald I can't operate in the hot sun without it, some king of skin thing that reacts to the sun. I went carefully and stressed hydration, as the day was predicted to be very hot. I had lunch at Bryant Ridge Shelter and rested a bit. The trail was pleasant, walking beside some streams and benefiting from the air conditioning effect, the usual wildflowers. 
The afternoon was hot and not much breeze. There were two climbs - one of 1,000 feet and the other 1,800. I had hoped to reach Cornelius Creek Shelter but stopped short of that at the tent-site, where I took the best spot and then went down a steep 0.1 to collect water. The source was shallow and I had to dip with the lid to my cooking gear. I brought up 3 liters as I didn't want to make the trip twice. 
There was a large log suitable for sitting and as a surface to cook on. I met Papa John and Trail Princess, who blog here at Trailjournals. He noticed a copperhead beside the log and after some discussion with myself and others he killed it. I was against it at first but then with about 10 people there and the log a natural gathering place it's a long way to medical help it something happens. 
As the day wore on more hikers stopped, and eventually we had a little tent city, many of them clustered around my site which was the biggest. It was buggy and there were hornets that were attracted to anything that smelled like food. Outsourced noticed he was alone on the other side of the trail, it wasn't him, just the quality of the sites. It was hot enough that I slept on top of my bag most of the night.","

There are no signs for the privy, it's behind the shelter to the left. There are numerous quality tent-sites and the site was dryer and less buggy than where I stayed. 
The second climb was 1,200 feet. The day was extremely hot with no wind. The trees at that altitude are still bare in places, so there was nowhere to hide from the sun. The understory featured many flowers, to include trillium that are gone by at lower altitudes. There was some sort of an FAA or weather station at the top of Apple Orchard Mountain. 
It's a steep climb from there down to the Guillotine, very thoroughly stair stepped. It got cooler and I enjoyed the sense of expectation as I neared the day's feature. Unfortunately, there was no-one there to do a photo of me standing under it, so I snapped a couple of shots, one from each direction, and continued on my way. 
There was supposed to be a spring before Matts Creek Shelter, but I didn't see a way down. According to comments in GutHooks, there is a spring there and also at the shelter, one has white worms and the other doesn't. I was running short of water and what I had was so warm that drinking it made me nauseous. I didn't have any other signs of heat stress so I skipped the downhill to the problematic sources and continued on to Thunder Ridge. I was glad to see my car. I drove to Buena Vista and booked a room in the eponymous motel.","

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565488,"While taking a zero in Buena Vista I arranged for Gary Serra to help me spot my car at 501 (the James River footbridge) and drop me off at Thunder Ridge. We both arrived at 501 early so I got an early start.
The weather had cooled down and the trail was mostly downhill. I took it easy and enjoyed the rhodo and mountain laurel blooming. Not too many thru-hikers as many went to Damascus for Trail Days.
I stopped for water at Marble Spring which is green and grassy. The water is 300 feet downhill. It looked awfully dry until I got there and a good flow came out of what looked like a dry stream bed. 
I ate half a Knorr's with spam. I was planning to tent before Matts Creek Shelter and would be carrying 3 liters as there was no source at the planned stopping point. I added Gatorade powder to 1 liter for ectrolytes.
Some boyscouts passed through and I spent some time talking to their adult leaders. Also a group of 4 thru-hiker alumni, one of whom was a Yalie, a graduate of their forestry program. 
It started to look like rain. I was making good time and eventually decided to go for the shelter. The boyscouts were all tenting and I got a space in the shelter. It rained, a torrential downpour with thunder and lightening. The boyscouts had some equipment failures and two of them moved into the shelter. Hammock/tarp mismatches. 
After the rain slowed down we cooked at the table and in front of the shelter. It was crowded but everyone was on good behavior. 
I slept soundly and left early in the morning. It was two miles to the car and I headed for home. The section went well in that eventually the hard work and frequent zero days got me to where I could do the hills more strongly and still have some energy at the end of the day. 
I was happy to tie everything together at the James River. I have now done the whole trail except for the 100 Mile Wilderness and Katahdin. I plan to finish in late Summer when the bugs will be less of a problem and the rivers will be easier to ford. I enjoyed Maine a lot last year and look forward to finishing my hike there.","Thunder Ridge Overlook and Parking

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572134,"After the famous breakfast at Shaw's I caught a ride to the trail and started slowly while the three eggs, bacon, hash browns and blueberry pancakes settled in. 
Maine is wet, rocky, muddy and rooty. The soil under the pines and firs is thin and erodes easily, leaving behind rocks and roots. Bog boards help but can be slippery or unstable. 
There was one ford - Big Wilson Stream. I changed from hiking boots to trail runners as a strategy to keep my primary foot gear dry and avoid damage to the feet. At tbe ford I met Southern Planter and Sliderule who were using the same strategy. Southern Planter is 72, a retired funeral director. Like me, he's a section hiker who will complete the trail within the next few weeks. 
At Little Wilson Falls I met some trail maintainers who were moving the trail away from the edge of the steep slate gorge. Somebody fell over the edge and drowned a few years ago. 
I found the terrain difficult and reached the shelter somewhat late. There were other elderly section hikers there and we discussed several situations where senior hikers have completed all but a few miles but age or health concerns kept them from finishing. Food for thought. 
Several of those present had noisy air matresses, bright white headlamps and the usual need to get up several times at night. That and some snoring, not too bad. I was tired and slept well under the circumstances.","Monson

The view was outstanding. 
I didn't make very good time as tbere was a lot of uphill, unrelenting. I was once advised that hikers should respond to such conditions with relentless determination. What works for me is I take regular rest breaks.

Poet suggested I stop at Chairback Gap Lean-to, which I did. Southern Planter and Sliderule were there, as planned. Landsman was waiting for his father CubsWin. They are a father and son team doing a flip-flop. Unfortunately CubsWin had aggravated a previous hamstring injury and was forced to leave the trail.
It was a senior shelter, other than a young woman named Sierra. The shelter was at full capacity with six hikers but we handled the cramped quarters well. CubsWin arrived late and he and his son tented.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

After descending the trail ran along some ledges with a fine view back to the summit. My sheltermates were visible as specks, looking down at the same view I had a half hour before. 
So I yelled up at them ""haylo"" and got a good echo off the cliff. They waved and I waved back.

A lawyer and his former partner, a judge, stopped by. The lawyer is an enthusiastic guitarist and remarked on the quality of the house guitar at Shaw's. He was talking about my 25 year old Yamaha, which I leave at hostels so others can make and enjoy a little music. George (who sold me the guitar) told me that music is like sex, more fun to do it yourself than to watch (or listen). The judge has written a song about each war this country has been in, and the lawyer performs them. They played a song about a WWII bombing mission, well done. It borrowed a little bit from The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, which they acknowledged. The chords and progression were suitable for the theme. 
I mentioned to the judge that I don't like the ideological packing of the court, how the Republicans stonewalled and stole Obama's appointment. After correcting (as he thought) my pronunciation, he informed me that he has no ideology, just faithful adherence to the law and the exact meaning of the constitution. I took that to mean that a group of landed slave-owning aristocrats had created a document that could be narrowly interpreted to apply to the USA in the 21st century, with inalienable rights, liberty and justice for all. Same as it ever was. We let the conversation lapse and they moved on. 
Eight young women appeared and scouted around for tent-sites. I explained that the tent-site was on the other side of the stream and they left. I learned from a later hiker passing through that they all took a swim in bikinis. Oh well, I missed it, I could have joined them frolicking in the water.

Gulf Hagas was remarkable to the amount of moose poop at the summit. Coming one after another the aggregate climb was impressive, and tiring. 
On top of White Cap I could hear thunder in the distance, and saw one flash of lightening. There is a side trail to a viewpoint where you can see Katahdin on a clear day. I took it, but couldn't see my ultimate goal. Being the tallest thing around, I didn't linger, but hustled on down the trail to where the trees were taller than me.
At the lean-to there were two SoBos. We talked a while and turned in early. At 8:30 WilldaBeast came in under his headlamp and loudly announced that somebody had to move over to make room for him.

Before I went far I realized that I was hungry, angry, lonely and tired. By way of reducing that I stopped at East Branch Lean-to, cooked breakfast, rested a bit, and dropped the resentment. Soon enough Willdabeast turned up and we had a civil conversation. He was having digestive issues and I talked a little bit about how that was a problem for me back in 2013 when I attempted a through hike. Vitamin D, B12 and so forth and so on. He has been eating a lot of ramen. So I went on to where I had to rock hop across a stream. I misplaced a pole, which sank three feet into a space between the rocks on the stream bed. My left foot instinctively went to restore my balance, sank into a space between the rocks and got stuck. I couldn't get it out, and sat there on a rock in the middle of the stream, waiting to be rescued. Soon enough Willdabeast came along and after working on it for about 15 minutes got my foot loose. He took my pack and poles, then tried tugging at the leg, prying the rock, or removing my boot. Finally we went back to the idea that it had to come out the way it went in. It went in forward, so he got down in the stream and pushed my shin backward, while I pulled it back as hard as I could. The foot budged a few times, then I was free. He put my pack on the other shore, stayed and watched me get across, then went on up the trail, but not before I could thank him for rescuing me. There's a Bible verse, maybe in Proverbs, about being kind to your enemies, it's like pouring hot coals on their head. Of course I had dropped my resentment so I wound up just being grateful. From there the trail became very pleasant, sloping gently downhill on pine needles, not too many rocks or muddy patches to deal with. I made good time to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to.

He's 82, retired from the Navy, and attempting a through hike. He has a happy outlook on life and struck me as very fit, an example to the rest of us senior hikers of what is possible, alternatives to sitting around and vegetating. At the Mahar Tote Road I turned off to go to White House Landing. There is service there so I texted and soon Bill came along in his boat and took me back to the hostel. The accommodations were good, I got a room in a cabin, along with Predator, Gung Ho, and Ready. There were several other hikers staying in other cabins, to include Cold Blood whom I met two years ago at Stanimal's in Wolfeboro, VA. I didn't recognize her at first, even after introductions, since she has lost quite a bit of weight. Hiking will do that. Supper was good sized hamburgers, always suitable hiker fare. The conversation was animated, as several of us hit on personal issues we had in common and discussed them at some length. I felt as if Cold Blood would have been happier with a more generalized conversation, something about packs, or boots, the usual trail talk. I apologized to her in the morning and she said it was OK. I got up in the middle of the night to pee and was startled by the brightness of the stars and Milky Way. The grounds are cleared and there was no obstruction from trees, also, they turn the generator off at night and there was no artificial light from any source, being so far from civilization.

Broad leave vegetable won't grow in the presence of that chemical and he was basically out of business. He elected to sell his farm, and got full price as the buyer just wanted to grow grass. So he and his wife decided to do a through hike SoBo. She got injured on Katahdin and went home. He was in the process of making a decision to give up his hike and go home to be with her.

The trail has sections where you are either looking back at where you've been, or forward at where you're going. After doing Mount Washington there were numerous places where you can look back at it, I was there, I climbed that, etc. So for NoBos we can look at Katahdin, in wonder, I'm going to climb that? At Crescent Pond there were some canoes just sitting there. In this section of Maine people sometimes bring a boat in and leave it, it's just too much trouble to get it in and out of the woods. But they don't leave paddles or oars, so I guess they don't want hikers to enjoy a little boat ride. Oh well. The Rainbow Stream Cascades were impressive and it was a lot of fun hiking along beside the stream. I asked some passing hikers to take my picture, as shown the bugnet makes me look goofy. But mosquitoes can be a source of torment: I hiked in long pants and sleeves, with the bugnet about half the time, and my hands slathered with Deet. But I still got a lot of bites. Most hikers wear a tee shirt and shorts, to stay cool. I don't know how they do it. Many of them have legs that are liberally spotted with bites.  The lean-to has a baseball bat floor and everybody tented. There are numerous tent sites among the pines (or spruce, fir, hemlock, whatever) , a nice open space and soft needles. The lean-to didn't act as a social center, we cooked by our tents and drifted around socializing. I met Soul Asylum who is from Watkins Glen in the Finger Lakes area of NY.

Taking a break by a lake, I noticed a loon just sitting there. I wonder if it was nesting. It didn't pay any attention to me, and I noticed that it had a long sharp bill and decided not to approach it, on the grounds that if it was nesting it might attack me. I was attacked by an eagle once, for getting too close to its nest, and it was somewhat scary.  
At the shelter the good tent sites had already been taken by a group of young campers. The baseball bat floor of the lean-to was uninviting, so I found a site that was almost level and had a nice rock to sit on. I cooked at the lean-to, and attracted a crowd of the young campers. They passed me a few days before, and one of them offered to shake hands. I had him do the fist bump and soon had a greeting line going as the bunch of them trooped by. So we had a replay, and they insisted on making me part of a group photo. I guess they liked my trail name. One of them brought the jawbone of a deer to the lean-to, and hung it on a mouse hanger.

So I could resupply at Abol Bridge and hike on through to Katahdin Stream Campground, or else shuttle back to Millinocket and plan to do the last 10 miles before Katahdin as a slack pack the next day. The view of Katahdin from the bridge was outstanding. The water wasn't as blue as it shows in the photo, but everything else is accurate, that's the way I will remember the mountain. The diner wasn't doing much, since they had just had a fire in the generator building and there was no electricity. There was a buffet, sausage, eggs and some form of starch, which was adequate. They will let you use the phone, for a fee, but had no service, due to the fire. I talked to a ranger and he was kind enough to use his radio to get ""AT Paul"" to come out and get me. I figured I had finished the 100 Mile Wilderness and a nice easy slack pack would be a good warmup for Katahdin. Back in Millinocket I did laundry, hung around playing the guitar, and ventured out to the River Driver Restaurant for a tasty (and expensive) meal. Southern Planter and Sliderule had summited Katahdin and I joined them for a group photo before they left. Southern Planter is 72 and had been section hiking for 23 years. He is very courteous and considerate, and an influence on others. Sharing a shelter with him and four others, I noticed we all managed to stay out of each others way and cook our meals, pack up, etc. very efficiently. Different from other times where I would just sit somewhere until others cleared out and freed up some space. Millinocket is dying, slowly. The paper mill closed (for the first time) in 1972 and all the jobs went away. The downtown area is pretty much the same as it was in the 50's, other than half the storefronts are vacant.

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573786,"I took the shuttle with those who would be summiting, then after they got off Ole Man drove me a few more miles to Abol Bridge to resume my hike. I'm glad I decided to slack pack as it was one of the most beautiful sections of trail I've hiked and it was good not to be encumbered with a heavy pack, plenty of time and energy to take the side trails to various views and waterfalls. I really liked Daicey Pond. Looking across from the trail there were three log buildings, any one of which would make a splendid camp. Then I came across a spot where numerous frogs were gathered on the bank, not very timid and I was able to get a nice photo. As a child I used to fish with live frogs, they were easy to catch and make good bait. One day Bobby Murphy and I caught about 20 frogs and then took a row boat around the point to a place that was relatively shallow and full of pickerel. We baited our hooks with frogs, then threw another bunch of them into the water to attract attention. A feeding frenzy erupted, and we caught a number of large fish. We took them back to camp and cleaned them, noting with satisfaction that the innards were larded with frog fragments. Miss Bess cooked them up, I forget whether it was for supper or breakfast, and the whole excursion ended well. Daicey Pond is limited to fly fishing, no fun. Arriving at Katahdin Stream, I chatted with a few people at the picnic tables or tent sites while making my way to the exit from the day use parking. It's very easy to hitchhike from there since everyone is going into or past Millinocket anyway and the pack and poles confer legitimacy. Not to mention white hair, in my case. I got a ride with a teacher who does blueberry farming in the summer. He raises ""wild"" blueberries, which means they are the same as found on top of the mountains, not the high bush hybrid types that yield so prolifically. When properly cut or burned off the wild type yield generous quantities of small, sweet berries. He had some of them with him, and I ate quite a few. It will turn your poop green, so don't look.

",Kathadin Stream Campground,"Jul 26, Wed",9.90
Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573564,"After completing the 100 Mile Wilderness, I took a zero with the idea of being well-rested for the last leg of my journey. Ole Man shuttled a group of us to the ranger station where we registered. I had brought a daypack with me. I had two liters of water, a puffy, raingear, snacks and a headlamp. I brought my poles, with the idea of stowing them if and when they got in the way. 
The trail is easy to begin with but soon starts to climb. I met Tipperary and Quick Start, both of whom blog here at Trailjournals. I took a few pictures at Katahdin Falls. After so much anticipation I had a pretty strong rush of adrenalin and made good time in the early going. 
The rebar or as they now call it monkey bars is a common point for hikers to turn back if they feel the climb is beyond their capabilities. I have talked to or heard about several who have done so. When I got there, a group of us stood there checking it out and two day-hikers turned back. I watched several younger hikers go up the feature, and decided to continue. The monkey bars are small metal bars, bent into suitable shapes, that serve as hand or footholds in the rock. They were placed right where they needed to be, for a person my size (5'11""). Some shorter hikers found it a stretch to get to some of the handholds. 
As I approached the Gateway the adrenalin wore off and I slowed down. I was looking forward to sauntering across the Tablelands, where the grade is fairly lenient, but it was rough and rocky and I went slowly, picking my way across. After passing Thoreau Spring (it's a puddle) at the junction with the Abol Trail I could see a crowd at the summit. Descending hikers passed me on their way down - I congratulated them and they wished me luck. 
It took me about six and a half hours to reach the summit. After studying my local training hikes, during which I focused on altitude gain, I found that I can climb somewhere between 10 and 20 feet per minute on a sustained basis. So, a 4,200 foot gain at 10 feet per minute works out to seven hours. I figured I could do it in 6 or 7 hours. I didn't plan the descent, other than to be patient and take my time. 

At the summit I posed for a picture and enjoyed the views. It was overcast, cool and windy, so the pictures I took are somewhat somber. I didn't experience the jubilation or exuberance some hikers feel, it was more of a quiet satisfaction that I had completed my once in a lifetime journey and adventure. Zebra posed on top of the sign (in photos). 
The descent was an attention getter. I elected to go down the recently renovated and reopened Abol Trail, rather than going back the way I came on the Hunt (AT) Trail. I didn't want to do the monkey bars in reverse and the Abol Trail, while steep, doesn't have any features that require a lot of thought or unconventional maneuvers. I joined up with a group of 4 day hikers who were descending at a pace that was comfortable for me. Jessica is good at downhill and the rest of us mostly followed her lead. Eventually I asked Jessica and Marsha, who had a car at the bottom, if they could give me a ride into Millinocket, which they agreed to do. So we hiked along, chatting about this and that, while the trail gradually flattened out. It turned sunny, hot and windy. My hat blew away (I had a spare). At the bottom, I yogied some water and declined the offer of a beer. From there it was on into Millinocket, where I had a shower, a late supper, and so to bed.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Swamp Fox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580074,"Late last month I briefly went back to the trail where I started, close to Bull's Bridge, CT. I wanted to see a meteor shower, and with the usual articles describing the Orionids around October 21st, I decided to go where it would be dark enough to get some visibility. The night was clear, and the moon was new, just a sliver. I camped at the tent site where the Ten Mile River flows into the Housatonic. I had company: a scoutmaster with two scouts, two men with a surly dog, and three young people partying. The men with the dog took the shelter, which is on a large open space. The dog behaved badly and I decided to use my tent and work from the smaller open area at the tent site. In any event, it was cold, I got up in the middle of the night and saw one meteor. I plan to try again, in November the Leonids are scheduled for the 17th, again with a new moon. Weather permitting, I'll be there. 
The river was pretty in the morning, misty where it turned and headed down to the sea, and decorated with autumn leaves on one bank. I took the Homestead Trail back toward my car, since it was easier walking and I had already done the section several times. And I passed the sign where the AT turns North, which is where I started late in 2012. 
As my section hike developed, the goal of completing it by the time I was 70 became part of my thinking. I got a little confused, perhaps because the Bible talks about three score and ten as the normal lifespan. So somewhere in the back of my mind, completing the trail was like the final goal and endpoint of my life, after which I was just supposed to hang around and wait for the end. I won't say I got depressed, just a little bit at loose ends, what do I do now? I played with various options, one of which was to become a full-time protestor against the current administration, neo Nazis, white supremacists and alt-right organizations, etc. 
Then there was the scheme of going down to Nashville and becoming a country singer, along the lines of Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Townes Van Zandt, Hank Williams, etc. Never realistic, and less so at 70. Nobody wants to hear an old guy sing, although Willie would be an exception. A lot of them had life styles that weren't conducive to longevity, I'm not sure whether its a BFOQ or not. 
Anyway for whatever bonus years I get, the plan is to continue writing about stocks, collect the modest income from page clicks, and donate the proceeds to causes I support. I plan to continue hiking, but not much backpacking, and more focus on enjoying nature. I will stay with the guitar and singing, and learn a few new songs from time to time.  If I had been aware of how difficult the terrain is in NH and ME I wouldn't have committed to making the journey. But once I got started, it turned into a pilgrimage of sorts, a once in a lifetime journey, with Katahdin as the goal. Somewhere in human nature is the archetype of life as a journey, and the Appalachian Trail with its grand sweep fits into the mold. Certainly one can learn (or practice) patience, perseverance, planning, preparation, tolerance, courage, fortitude and other life skills on the trail. And it's always good to get away from modern life and focus on basics like food, shelter and water. It clears the mind.
