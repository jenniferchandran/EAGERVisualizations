Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552296,"I started planning for this trip about four months ago. Reading up on gear, watching videos on YouTube, basically just learning everything I could about the trail about the gear, and about Hammock Camping, which I've never done before. Since I will be alone for most of the hike, Hammock Camping is a little lighter for one person and is more comfortable. I've always had problems with my shoulder hurting when sleeping in a tent on the ground. And an air mattress would just add weight.Physically preparing I was on a good track with losing weight and when on my first section hike of the AT, starting at Amacolola Falls. However, I ran into a little problem. My heart short circuited . . . I ended up in ICU for 2 days.I had had this problem 4 years ago, where I has severe Atrial Tachycardia. In essence a short circuit in the top part of my heart. They were able to go, in and fix it. Which previously the only way to fix it was a pacemaker. Now they go in a cauterize the nerve causing the issue.Well, this time it's a different nerve. It's in the bottom side or Ventricle. So, being in Florida, and all the doctors are overbooked in Florida, I had to set an appt with my doctor. Only appt available was 3 weeks later. He referred me to a cardiologist. First available appt was 3 weeks later. He needed to do a stress test. The first available appt was 3 weeks later. He then referred me to a electrophysiologist. You guessed it, first appt, 3 weeks. Which will be Dec 30. After that well likely set the appt for the procedure, and the 30 days later I'll be cleared to resume normal activity. My doctor and my cardiologist both state that I will be go to go on the hike, and they will do what they can to help ensure I'm ready.Meanwhile, I can't increase my heart rate too much without possibly triggering another episode. Makes it very hard to train or lose weight.In addition to that, it also means I likely won't be able to start till March. I wanted to start mid February. I toyed with the idea of hiking from Daytona beach to Springer Mountain as a warm up. Well have to see. I was wanting to be done by August to get a job in Antarctica for the Antarctic summer (August to February). At the same time I don't want to rush the hike. So, I will see how it all plays out. What the hell. I may take my time on the AT, then go hike the PCT southbound, and go to Antarctica next year.",,Prepping and heartbreak,"Dec 09, Fri",0
Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552297,"Just a little back story. On my facebook page for the trip, I have my nickname as Bushmaster. I use this for gaming and such, but it is not my trail name. I don't have one yet. I will update it once I have one.
Also, I the most common question I get asked, is ""Aren't you afraid of xxx"". Whether it be bears, snakes, spiders, getting lost etc. Nope not afraid of any of that. There is one and only one thing that weighs heavy on my mind about my hike. You see I am originally from Kansas City Missour, and moved to Florida in 2001. I've been down here 15 years, and have gotten very used to it. There is only one thing I am afraid of . . . being cold.",,The story so far,"Dec 09, Fri",0
Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553053,It's cold here tonight in Florida. Well for Florida it's cold it's supposed to get down to 38 with a moderate wind. Right now the wind keeps blowing but it's only about 42. Goodnight to test my hammock system although I wish it was a little colder maybe down into the 30s. 30 degrees about the coldest it gets around Daytona where I'm at. I'll report back in the morning.,,Hammock system test,"Jan 08, Sun",0
Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557019,"Heart issue is fixed, although the Electophysiologist said it could reoccur as soon as 2 years from now, so I need to be prepared.Notice put in at job . . . check.All major gear ready and tested . . . check, well, still have to test the water filter.Guidebooks and info staged and ready . . . check.House sold . . . still finishing repairs, but will be ready by the time I leave out. It will be a 30 day bid, so it will be sold in 30 days regardless of price. I am confident that I will walk away with plenty to keep me funded for the next year. (especially when the trail will only take about 6000 over the next 6 months).Scared as hell . . . check. Never stopped me before.",,Countdown has begun,"Mar 20, Mon",0
Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557644,"One of my steps to getting closing to getting on the AT is done. As of Friday, I am unemployed. Friday was my last day at work. The final remaining step (which was supposed to be step one, or at least step two, selling the house, should be at a point that I can walk away, by next week. The roof is done, and I have an inspection scheduled for Monday. There is a couple of remodeling jobs that we have to finish, which should be done by Wednesday.But enough about that. On the trail, many people call this real life, and on the trail is trail life. I like what someone had said, that this is synthetic life, and the trail is real life. Here in this world, we get so busy making that next paycheck, paying those bills, being here or there, that we lose site of just living. We always think, if I had millions, then I could live life. If you're willing to let go of the materialism, you can live life now.",,Getting closer,"Mar 26, Sun",0
Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561801,"I was originally going to skip the approach trail for now, and catch it after my through hike. I had seen an article that listed it as one of the 5 worst things about the AT. I can say it is steep. I don't know how it compares to Mount Mother from boot camp, but it certainy brought back flashbacks.Since I had done a section hike here last fall, and my heart short circuited again (something the doctors told me would never bother me again,), I felt like either before or after my hike that I needed to do it again. Well, after not being able to get a ride up to the service road to start near Springer,I decided that now was the time. I started out around noon, and finally arrived at Springer at 9:30. I wasn't stopping till I saw a white blaze. My knees hurt, my ankles hurt, my back hurts, well pretty much everywhere hurts. I'm going to take it much easier today.Along the way I met a number of day hikers. Met two thru hikers, a man with a German accent, Tunnel vision, and a 76 year old man, Stickman (he may also decide to go by Gandalf, it had been suggested, and he did bear a striking resemblance). Met a 70 year old grand father and his grandson who are hiking for a month. The grandfather will see at that point if he wants to continue. I hope he does. He was a very nice friendly person.","Amacolola Falls Visitor center

Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563252,"Took 4 days and then a zero in Dalongha, at the Quality in, then hiked 5 more days in to Hiawassee to the Top of Georgia hostel.  
I was able to ship back more unneeded gear.  If you do a thru hike, you don't need extra clothes.  One set for day, and your base layer for night.  Both for really cold days.  Do your updates at resupply and zero days.  Facebook will wait.  DARN TOUGH SOCKS or equivalent are a must!  Electrolytes are a must.
As for the hike, I have never so tired so sore, nor so at ease.  I thought going up some of these mountains my knees and ankles were going to give out.  I said I was only going to be doing 8 miles a day, but to reach Suches in 4 days (from Amacolola), I had to push the miles up to 10 a day.  To get from Suches to Hiawassee in 5 days, I had to push it to 14 a day.  Now I'm at the Top of Georgia hostel.  This by the way is an excellent hostel, rated one of the best hostels on the AT.  But you can find plenty of people raving about how great this place is online.
I have not seen a bear yet, nor any snake other than one common grass snake, but I have seen chimpmunks by the dozens, more millipedes than I have ever seen in my life in both numbers and species.
The community around the AT is something to behold, and far greater than I realized.  It is more than words can convey.","

Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565465,"Well, I have not kept up on this journal, I will try to do better.
The story so far.  I started on the approach trail on Apr. 26th.  Starting two days in, I kept running into the same group each day.  The group included Mouse King, Birthday, and a few others.  I eventually was left behind, as they were faster, and the same for Birthday.  We then ended up hiking with Magic Mike, B squared, General Hendricks, Phantom, Cindy Lou Who, and here lately Gazelle.  General Phantom, Cindy and Gazelle have now gotten a couple days ahead of us, so it is down to ths 4 of us for now.  A few days ago, B squared ran across a mama bear and 3 tiny babies, and had to back off and let them leave the trail.  This was in the Smokies, where we have seen a number of deer and turkeys.
We zeroed in Dalonaga, At the Top of Georgia, and in Gatlinburg.  We stopped and reapplied at the NOC.  Currently we are at the ice spring shelter, after a cold day in the rain.","

Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569536,"Well, I've once again forgotten to update this journal in a while.  What has happened since then?
Injury.  I started to get a daily pain in my ankle as we hiked through the smokies.  Also we hit 4 days straight of rainy weather, so I forgot about the ankle pain, and concentrated more on the fact that trenchfoot stripped the skin off my heels.  I could only feel that pain, and did not realize the ankle problem was getting worse.  After a week, once the bandaged heels started feeling better, I realized the ankle was very bad.  I was able to isolate it to the muscle movement.  Moving the joint by hand or by body movement didn't hurt, it was only when I would try to move it with the muscle.  B squared picked up an ankle brace for me that kept it from moving, so that was ok for a while, but every time I would trip or kick something with that foot (which is hard not to do with all the rocks and roots on the trail), I would involuntarily jerk that muscle, and would be in excruciating pain.  So I finally had to stop hiking on it.  I got off the trail at Iron mountain Gap, and went to boots off Hostel.   Saw a doctor, who said I had a Repeditive strain injury to my tendon.  Good news, it won't tear, bad news it was going to hurt a while.  She gave me a steroid shot and some prescription strength anti inflamitories.  I joined back up with the group when they got to boots off, but I will have to make up that section when I finish my hike.  Our group has grown and shrunk a few times.  Birthday is a few days behind us now, the group currently is B squared, Magic Mike, no stress, Mantis, Trail Magic, Ginger and Digerydamn.  Mantis and I will be heading out ahead of the group by a day.  She has to be in Harper's Ferry in 18 days, and I am going along to keep her company.

And I was the only one who participated in hike naked day (only for a mile though) of our main group, but Trail Magic and Ginger hiked naked by themselves quite a ways.","Perisburg VA

Bushmaster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581402,"Sorry I have not updated this.  When I would get into town, I would get on facebook, update it, and that was all the social interaction I could deal with.  I did complete the Trail on October 30th.  As an overview I started the trail on April 25th at Springer Mountain, hiked to Harper's Ferry, my tramily and I (known as the Wolf Pack, since I looked like Alan from Hangover by that point), took a vote to continue hiking north to Katahdin, even though we were in threat of not getting there before the first snows.  We then watched the weather forcast for the week.  It had already been in the low 90's all week, I can still remember most of the forcast.  98 degrees, 99 degrees, 101 degrees and 98 degrees.  We had already been sick hiking in the heat, and due to all of the pine in the area of Harpers Ferry, we knew that it was very difficult to hike at night, as it was hard to stay on trail. So we voted again and flipped up to Katahdin.  I separated from the group at the Whites, and continued on my own to Harpers Ferry.  
You can find my Facebook page at:  https://www.facebook.com/profi...
I also have a YouTube channel at :  https://www.youtube.com/channe...
Be sure to catch the Roan Mountain shelter dance video.  First a little background.  I'm setting around the fire listening to music.  Birthday comes up and sits down, and Dance Dance Dance comes on (by Justin Timberlake), and he says, ""We should do a dance video"".  I was like ""We could do a 360 degree dance video"".  We asked everyone else there, ""Wanna do a dance video?""  Everyone was rather excited about doing.  We were losing the light, so it had to be done quickly and with no practice.  Someone suggested we wait till the first chorus.  Little did any of us know that it was so long into the video.  When you start to play it, be sure to click on the 360 degree button (if it isn't already in 360 mode), and then use your mouse (or finger if you are on your phone), to move the video around.  Before you can see anyone, you can hear people giggling.  See how many people you can count hiding behind the trees before the chorus starts.


I apologize for not updating Facebook, and especially this journal as often as I could.  I didn't do this to impress all you motherfuckers....LOL.  I know many of you wanted to follow my journey, hopefully you found me on Facebook.  
Unfortunately I lost a number of my final 360 videos.  They were on a memory card that somehow got folded in half.  I tried to straighten it out, and snap . . . 
It had all of the photos from about New Hampshire to Harper's Ferry also, but it appears they were all synced to my google photos, so I don't think I lost anything there, except a video about some annoying boy scouts my last two days on the trail.
All in all, I loved the journey, although I was sick of hiking by the last month.  I just wanted to be done.  I don't know that I would do another thru hike, but given time, I will forget how tired I got of it, and it will sound like a good idea again.  I still wouldn't have missed it for the world.",,Harper's Ferry,"Dec 22, Fri",0
