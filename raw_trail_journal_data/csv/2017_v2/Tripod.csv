Tripod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553549,"I am pretty well set on starting out on 4/17. This is the Monday after Easter Sunday so possibly the Tuesday the 18th. The one item of concern is being able to take a break May 6th for my daughter's college graduation. Hannah will be getting her degree in early (K-5) education and will finally be teaching someone other than mom and dad. Ha. She is brilliant and I am very proud of her successfully completing her B.S. degree at GCSU. From what I can tell, it should be fairly easy to find a stopping point at the 3 weeek mark which may also prove advantageous to tweak some equipment / food / clothing. Yesterday I bought a camp stove. I have been looking at the Jetboil model but went with another; MSR. The unit is apparently better suited for wind and has a better area to grip with less chance of being burned by the hot surface. I was looking at another pair of shoes for the trip. Currently I have a pair of Zamberlan boots that were very well made and waterproof. I was considering the point that they are pretty heavy and a lighter weight non-waterproof pair might be better and because whatever I wear, they will be getting wet. The non WP might dry quicker than the heavier waterproof boots. I will need to get some more opinions on this since shoes will be an important part of staying comfortable and functional.The next steps to work through will be purchasing a pack, tent, sleeping pad, and some other odds n ends.

My wife says I might be living on the edge but I did promise her ""no short-cuts"" for safety's sake. I've had the awesome benefit of being able to work for one of the best companies that exists, Georgia-Pacific, for the past 24 years!   It's now time to say ""see-ya"" and move on. As I do, I will miss many friends that I've had the pleasure of working with, filed away all those incredible places I've been so fortunate to visit, and set my sights on the next moving target.   The great task of accomplishing this hike will be exciting and beneficial to hopefully many.   This hike / journey will be accompanied by a fundraiser to raise funds to install a water system in Nicaragua. Going to coin the phrase ""Let's carry a pack so they don't have to carrry water""! This is for a community that has to walk a mile or two to get water for cooking cleaning, drinking etc. from a contaminated source. Hope to make a difference!

Tripod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554625,"Kim and I return from our cruise to Cozumel Mexico. It was a perfect weather and perfect water time. However I was glad to be home after the five days at sea. A cruise is about as complete an opposite to hiking the trail as you can get. On the cruise we had a couple thousand people in a small area with unlimited figured and unlimited drink and about as much slack time as you can get. Water flows endless and life is too easy. I managed to workout at the gym on the ship each day and walk the stairs avoiding the elevators from the fourth floor where we stayed to the 10th floor where food and beverage resided. It was a fun event and I am glad that I went out, however it does not compare to my excitement to hit the trail. 
I finally purchased my pack and decided on an Osprey 65. I took a practice run at Fort Yargo and hiked about 12 miles. Beginning at about 2 o'clock I am finishing around 630 so TOM was not too bad. Because it was the first day with some new shoes I was a little concerned about blisters or foot pain. I have a little ha ha. Overall weather was perfect and I felt good with the pack as I made a few adjustments along the way. 
I'm excited about putting in some additional time getting ready and preparing my feet and legs. Hopefully will be able to go to stone mountain for a couple long walks and see how a good uphill goes after about 5 miles.",,Ft Yargo Practice Day,"Feb 15, Wed",0
Tripod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558841,It's been a few weeks since gathering equipment and making plans. Things are coming together with about two weeks before my planned departure.   I had a nice blister to deal with during my practice runs which was a reality check.   Good food prep for the first week with some good advice taken from others. My pack is right at 35 lbs. The added weight of about 5 lbs came from the hydro bladder and full food bag. It seems like a manageable weight knowing I can take off about 5 pounds if needed. Once I get a couple weeks in I will decide what if anything needs to go home. Several friends are making plans to meet me which is exciting and I'm sure to anticipate seeing folks while out on the trail. More soon!Tripod,,Anticipation of Departure,"Apr 05, Wed",0

My wife and daughters will spend the day with us and have a awesome (high carb-out) meal of lasagna which is one of my wife's favorites and I will be dreaming of that meal for quite a while. Once we wrap up Easter, my wife and I plan to set out on the drive to Amicalola Falls to spend the night at the lodge before hitting the woods. Should be a great couple days! I am humbled that a few friends have planned to come up to AF's Lodge to send me off!

I made it 15 miles the first day (7 on approach trail) checking in at Springer Mountain around 10:45 AM. Yesterday was harder than day before due to a couple huge mountains to cross.   I made it 16 miles day two; last few were very tough!

Tripod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561632,"This weekend was exceptional! Kim picked me up at Unicoi Gap after about 10 miles of hiking. She brought cold Gatorade and cold pizza.., you'll have to ask her about the cold pizza ??. We stayed in Helen GA for the night and Saturday she dropped me off at Unicoi to hike over the mountains to Dicks Creek Gap (17 miles) without a pack!   It was a fun hike but I got carried away with the light weight trek and got a thigh cramp so I limped for 8 miles. Kim met me and we took a couple fellow hikers, Barry & Jordan from NY to dinner. ((Jordan operated a children's home in NY before retiring). Great company. 
Sunday was the best. We went to Mass at St. Paul the Apostle in Cleveland, GA where we ran into fellow Curstillstas, Bart and Bob (Cincotta). What an awesome blessing to attend Mass with great friends. After Mass Bart and Bob had breakfast with us!   Bart generously picked up the bill! After breakfast Kim delivered me back to Dicks Creek where I got out in the rain and hiked about 12 miles. The weather got worse as I went. I was in shorts and Tshirt. It got blowing cold rain on top of the mountain as I crossed the GA / NC line around 4:30pm. Dark clouds overhead with some flashing lightning as I made it a few more miles sloppy wet and ready to end that one. The shelter was full so I set my tent up quickly and dried off. Went to sleep hearing rain and a nice Creek beside me.

Entries are difficult due to cell service. I am making good time but sore feet and weather are good for some delays. I hit some incredible over looks that I could see about 10 yards due to fog!! Ha. But I did happen upon one that had a good view. 
I made it into Frankin with the assistance of a nice fellow who gave me a ride from the trailhead about 10 miles. He even gave me an appetite busting restaurant, ""Fat Buddies BBQ"" where I got an awesome order of ribs, baked beans, and a cheese burger with blackberry cobbler for dessert!! Nice friendly folks there. Getting ready to dry some wet clothes and hit the K Mart before heading back up the hill to go back into the woods. Should have a night without rain. 
Franklin is known for the outdoors store that gives free beer to hikers. A tough decision to avoid it, but no strong drink until after April for the cause. Been saying two Rosaries daily as well for those who sponsored me and my special intention. Lots of time for good solid prayer!

Tripod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563210,"I made it over several mountains and along the trail for several days to a small but scenic location called Fontana Dam.  The lake looked incredible coming off the mountain and I was really looking forward to the stop and a day off.  Since I had been dropped by Kim on 4/23, I'd hiked several days and bypassed a stay in Franklin so I was ready for a down day to recover.  I got to the lodge with a buddy I met named Kansas (from Kansas) and he being a air traffic controller retiree, kept the conversation on the trail for a few days going well.   We were able to have an awesome dinner and get resupplied and clean clothes.  
The location was enjoyable and by Sunday morning, I was ready to head out.  Planned to hike a good 20 miles or so for the next few days with fresh legs.
The Smokey Mountains are known for their weather.  I didn't know that!! Well, the day I left Fontana, it was nice and sunny.  It got cooler and very windy by evening.  In fact, winds had to be blowing 30 mph at the top of the mountain.  Several folks at the shelter after about 18 miles commented on how it was going to turn bad.   So I went ahead and decided to stay.  The next morning, it was U-G-L-Y!  Winds had picked up a noch and rain was evidently on the way.  I set out.  I made 12 miles and by the time I hit the shelter, crossing some of the ridges had to have seen 50 mph winds with pellets of rain drilling my right side.  I was a mess, in a T-shirt and shorts and warm enough as long as I was moving.  I didn't stop moving until I hit a shelter and quickly got into dry clothes around 3PM. By 6PM, the sun was out and the wind was still whipping.  I strung up a line and dried all my clothes and pack cover.  It was a drab feeling, sitting at a shelter instead of hiking in such a sunny day, but the trail was wet and I was done for the day.   
The following day I did 22 miles.  It was cold and windy but I struggled to make it over Clingman's Dome and a few other high peaks; I crossed the TN/NC line where many tourist were enjoying the view.  I was determined to get the hell out of the Smokies!  And had a ways to go yet.  More cold wet weather was predicted and I didn't want any part of it. Ha.
Next day I hiked 23 miles and ended at another shelter ready to close out the Smokies.  I planned for 17 miles and when I got about 1/2 mile from my planned stop, my plans changed.  My feet were done, I was sore and hungry.  Ready for setting up my tent and getting water for the next day... Then, I saw on my map that there was a Hostel 4 miles ahead.  Now, somehow my feet were full of life.  Not sure whether it was the thought of a shower, thought of a bed, thought of fresh food, or the note on the map that said, ""nice place to have a beer""!  Maybe all the above ... ha ha.  My feet were ready and I had two more hours of hiking full steam ahead.  I had energy from somewhere deep down inside that surfaced new life in my weary knees.  I did make it to the hostel and had a pizza with a beer!  And a shower, and a bed.  What a fine way to end a long day.","Fontana Dam

Tripod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563734,"Today was very pleasant!  First, I camped near a group from Greenville TN that was providing food for hikers.  Last night they gave me a cheeseburger, potato salad, cakes, cookies, and more.  This morning they made eggs, bacon, biscuits, pancakes, fruit, and more... God bless them. They made my day.  
So, I hiked about 20 miles today and always find it interesting that someone can walk up on me from behind and I don't realize it until they snort, or clack their trekking poles.   I suppose I make enough noise to cover their tracks. 
At one point today, I heard an odd noise in the distance.  I couldn't make it out, maybe a horse, or strange cat cry, could have been a whelping dog but not quite.  It got a little louder as I came down the trail.  Very strange whaling sounds.  Hummm. I saw about 80 yards out, a chunky woman with outstretched arms just crowing away at Loretta Lynns ""I'm the Happiest Girl In The Whole USA"". Her husband was bashfully plodding ahead of her a ways.  I walked my normal quick speed and got right behind her.  When she finished, I applauded and yelled ""bravo"" as she spun around with a start!  (I felt a little bad about scaring her).  I said hello, turned to her husband and said ""how are you doing? I already know how she is!""  I was quickly out of sight as I her the lady pick up on an old Bob Dylan (or maybe Boxcar Willy tune)...  a little ways down the trail, I heard some awful moaning ... maybe an elk, no moose. 
Well nonetheless I crossed that 300 mile point and was very happy.

I hung my food and set up my tent.  I was lucky as a couple flashes of lightning lite up the sky just as I was safely done for the night.  The rain started... and got harder.  All was dry in the morning! The following day I hiked 22 miles with the last 6 miles through mud, thunder, and heavy cold rain.  I landed a room at a hostel up the road and enjoyed a hot shower!!  
Today a family was giving out food as me and a couple fellow hikers stopped by at lunchtime.  I ate 2 pb&j's a plate of nachos, a banana, bowl of ice cream, some cheese crackers, an orange Fanta, and 2 cans of V-8 juice. It was joyous!

Last night I didn't sleep well for a couple reasons.  First, a long hot day ending with sitting in my tent on a side slope because I had a very late start (I had to get the good breakfast which delayed me until 9:30).

Tripod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570121,"Since my last update, I've passed a few important milestones.  The first was the Harpers Ferry, WV psychological mid-point of the trail.   The Appalachian Trail Conference center is here and hikers log in and get counted.  I logged in as hiker number 1012 of the 2017 year.  A nice stay at a hostel was well needed.  I had a couple fellow hikers  offer to take me to Wal-Mart to restock my food bag.  I should have asked how far the car was from the hostel.  I had to walk about a mile to and from the car which was painful.  
My second milestone was the famous Mason-Dixon Line which separates Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I was able to acquire a can of beer from a couple providing trail magic (free food for hikers alongside the trail) which I carried for 5-1/2 miles.  The beer was consumed on the Mason-Dixon Line which is supposedly a longstanding tradition.  Well, the beer was not cold and pack-shaken but served its purpose.  I did really enjoy the beer!  
My third significant milestone was hitting the true halfway point of the trail at 2:30 PM on 6/25.  It is a mental success to know I've hiked further now than the distance I have left.  The best part of the last few days has been the perfect weather.  If I have to be outside, it is in the cool sunny days that I've been blessed with.  
One other noteworthy point was my camp a couple nights ago.  I hiked out of a town with a campground choosing not to pay $30 to set my tent going about 5 miles up the trail looking all along for a spot to set up.   It got dark.  Real dark.  My headlight is good, but not that good so I was constantly looking for a suitable spot and finding nothing.  I did finally find a spot, got settled and started to sleep.  I woke to footsteps about 10:50.  Loud footsteps and close.  My heart was pounding and I was quickly thinking about if I had any food in the tent. I was thinking... bear.  Then a loud buck-snort and trampling off.  I was relieved.  This happened twice more, 2:30 and 4:00am.  It was no more easy to handle either time.  The best part was being so far away from anyone else, completely alone in the middle of the woods in pitch dark. A great experience which won't happen again!!  Oh, I've only seen one bear a ways back and it was a ways off and ran from me quickly.","Harpers Ferry WV

Tripod,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571009,"The last week or so through PA has been tough.  My feet are feeling the proverbial grindstone and daily beating on the rocky ground.  Several folks said that they felt PA was one of the hardest states to get through due to the amount of rocks that you have to walk over.  The really big rocks are not too bad unless they are wet as they get slick and you just don't want to go caving along the way (ha ha).  The softball sized rocks are worse as they tend to eat at the sides of your feet and we are talking sharp edges not round, so you get some knuckle balls in the bottom of your feet too.  
I made my way up one steep rocky climb yesterday hearing some cursing from above me.  I thought a guy may be hurt.  When I got to him, the young kid, about 20 or so, had tossed off his pack in frustration sitting on a rock, says, I've done rock climbing and refuse to climb a rock face like this without a rope!  In my calm and understanding way, I said, let's look at it and see if there is an easier way up. There was of course, and I passed him easily climbing up the rocks.  He watched me but I didn't see him follow.  He passed me down the trail a ways so I was glad he found a way over the boulders.  
I've been able to avoid rain the last few storms by getting to a good spot before the sky opened up. One night after I was in my tent squared away, the storm hit and a very hard rain fell for a couple hours.  I stayed dry due to a great tent!  I hate getting wet...
Tomorrow I will take off into NJ and apparently get out of the rocky terrain and into a better path that will hopefully generate some good mileage for a while.  I hear there are some tough rocky mountains ahead that might slow me up so I want to get as far as I can while the getting is good. I put a few more pics of the PA rocks in the photo section for your viewing pleasure.","PA / MD line

Man my feet were happy!!  One thing that surprised me was the amount of woodland in NJ   I always had a stereotypical view of NJ being about all city.  I was wrong as you can see from the attached photo.
During my NJ trek, twice in a row, evening T-storms blew up about 5pm. The thing about the Thunder storms is they don't last long ... but, they leave you sloshy and soggy wet.  Then, there isn't enough time for your clothes to dry so morning comes and yes, you have to redress in the cold wet things you slung off the night before.  Ok, shoes and shorts I can handle pretty well, but pulling on that cold wet shirt is for the dogs.  I probably need someone to take a pic of me when the wet shirt is going over my head.  I'm sure it would be a comedy show in itself.  Yuck."," Delaware water gap , PA

One thing is for certain, the gnats of Conn. are a bit more numerous and aggressive than other areas.  They like to bombard your eyes and in the low wet areas they run in herds!   Yesterday I thought I'd try a new tactic. I was at a restaurant and ordered a large pizza (yes, I ate it all myself ... with a large salad) as a topping, I added extra garlic thinking it might ward off some skeeters and gnats!  Well, the pie had so much garlic that it seriously was a little hot/spicy to eat; but I ate it.   The next day I only had to breathe a little deeper and share my breath with the bugs and they did tend to drop off.  I usually talk a bit with the other hikers but today no one wanted to hang with me.  Hmmm... I suppose between the lack of showers here lately and the extra garlic pizza, it's hard to tell what folks say/think as they pass by ... a few slipped and appeared to weaken or wobble as they responded with a grunt to my healthy comment of ""Good morning, How are you?""

One surprise that I'd not figured on was the caretaker of the site cooked a pot of stew and I was able to have my fill ... (and that was quite a bit of stew!!)

Graylock which is the highest point in Massachusetts, had bunks for $30 / night.  This meant a shower and restaurant meal!! It was nice to have a soft mattress under my back last night!  
Today, we hiked to the next town where I went on my own to do laundry and hit a grocery store.  I needed about 5 days of food supplies to get to the next planned resupply point.  As I continued from town up the next Mtn, I reached the state of Vermont!  It was nice to make it to the third to the last state and it was double exciting for me in that I've never been to Vermont.  
Now as you can see in my posted photo, I am donning a fashionable  accessory pack across my front.  Some call this pack a ""fanny"" pack and some call it a necessary bag but the name is not important.  It is important to know that this type of ""fanny pack"" is very fashionable and functional on and off the trail.  Recently I've been made aware of some ridicule of those making use of the fanny pack; but let me so say ... many fanny pack uses can be made in everyday life such as carrying item of importance.  Food snacks can be placed in such a pack as to maintain a course of action while snacking or a very convenient location for carrying a cellular phone.  My fanny pack is made of durable ripstop nylon with a heavy duty belt that has a quick release for those must have, emergency stops where personal items need to be dropped in a hurry in lue of non-mentionable tasks.  The fanny pack can also provide quick access to those necessary items such as tissue and wet ones where other type packs may cause embarrassment due to an undue delay.  
The fanny pack is a very functional and fashionable item that is making a comeback in its popularity.  We should take care not to judge those displaying a future trend both on and off the trail. In fact I've made up my mind that this Christmas all my friends and family will be receiving a nice fanny pack as a gift.  You too might consider such an incredible gift opportunity for birthdays (especially November and March birthdays)!  Endless possibilities come to mind - biking, jogging, work-lunches, walking, shopping, and of course hiking.","Mt.

I gained a few pounds back that will be needed in the coming weeks as well.  
As an added bonus I was able to hike through town and cross the Connecticut River into a new (the second to last) state, New Hampshire!  It was very meaningful to make the new state and leave Vermont.  Vermont is known for its Maple Syrup and yes, I was able to sample the goods on more than one occasion!  Great pancakes!  
Vermont is also known by the hikers for its southern mud!  I hiked through the rain one day and nearly sank up to my knees when I took a monster step to what appeared to be a rock.  It was just a blob of mud that looked like a rock.  I fished my way out and moved on.  I hiked an additional 4 miles that evening so I could get to a hotel where I was able to clean up.  Overall Vermont was very scenic and had some incredible stands of spruce-fir- and pine trees.  A remote and tough place to hike!","Norwich, VT

While on top of the mountain, a co-hiker had brought BBQ Ribs from below and we ate the at the top!   Also, making things a bit worrisome, there were storms on both sides of the trail in the distance!  One was pretty significant and being on top of a bare ridge like that would not be fun in a T-storm!!

Okay, Maine just happens to be a beautiful state.  I have been on many mountain tops and the remote lakes and forest is awesome.  If it was a little warmer I'd have been tempted to swim in one of the most incredible lakes.  However, it was still a bit chilly to jump in.  
There is a spot just as you enter Maine that is reportedly the most difficult mile on the AT, Mahoosuc Notch.   I will not call it MY most difficult mile, but it is an incredibly slow climb among boulders of various sizes between cars and houses.  Many jumps, swings from trees, and nervous maneuvering over and around the large rocks made a mile that usually takes 20 to 30 minutes take more than an hour.  Many black holes going down for who knows how far made me wonder how many bones were down there where hikers slipped and were just never heard from again???  I was happy to get past that debacle just to run into another lovely obstacle, a 3000 foot climb up what's called the Mahoosuc Arm.  A huge climb that took every bit of energy I had.  I made it in case anyone is wondering.  No falling either.  I stopped by a nice lake to enjoy the view after the climb and stepped on some wet roots and mud ... my feet shot out from under my limp energy depleted core and my ass hit smack down on the slimy edge of the water.  I about went in.  Now, you might not think much about my butt hitting the ground, but that was only the third time in 1900 miles that I went down. I was kinda proud of that until today. I fell three more times today alone.  I'm getting really tired of this slick muddy state!

I estimate about 8 more hiking days to finish up the trail and then I will be settled with my trail commitment and able to head back home.  I'm sure the last few miles will be as challenging as all those beforehand but being able to see the end will be much more palatable.  Still I have a huge 180 miles to hike which will eat my feet and test my fortitude; but with the reward of making it home, I'm all for pushing forward with more miles and tougher conditions so I can finish strong!","Stratton ME
