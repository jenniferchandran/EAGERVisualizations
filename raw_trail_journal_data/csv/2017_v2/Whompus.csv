Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/472832,"This journal is for my up coming thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. I have most of my gear already lined up. However, I still need to purchase some essential gear such as a down jacket and sleeping bag. There is still a little time between now and my start in March so I'm not feeling rushed and plan on taking my time to make good decisions. I will be writing more entries as I get closer. I may add one or two more entries now to give you some background on who I am.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Tue",0
Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/472840,I thought I'd write a little bit of a background about myself. I spent most of my adult life in the military. I've lived in Europe and Asia and all across the country before I came back to small town Virginia. I been out of the Army five years now and I'm really yearning for another great adventure. I heard about the AT ever since I was a child. Yet I never spent any time hiking it. Mostly because I had so much beautiful wilderness so close to my home to explore. I got really serious about thru hiking the AT in 2008 when I read 'A Walk In The Woods' by Bill Bryson. That's when the day dreaming started. I continued to read every book about the AT and long distance hiking in general I could find. Serious plan however didn't start until this summer. Circumstance have allowed me to hike much sooner then I thought I would ever get to and I'm thankful for that.,,View Entry,"Jan 05, Thu",0
Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/472856,I got my sleeping pad in yesterday. I decided on the BigAgnes Q-Core SLX. It has an r-rating of 4.7 so I'm hoping it will be enough to keep me warm for my early March start. I tend to sleep very cold so any extra warmth is worth the weight at this stage. The last piece of essential gear left to purchase will be my sleeping bag. I will likely go with the Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 800 fill down as my early spring bag. I get claustrophobic is standard bags and the openness of this bag seems to cure me of that. I'm going to work on posting my gear list and once I get my gear laid out I will make one last prep post with my starting equipment list for all you gearheads. Well wish my luck. I'm committed to this journal so feel free to post in my guestbook and I will do my best to respond.,,View Entry,"Jan 08, Sun",0
Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555449,Riding the train down to GA. It's hard for me to relate to you just how excited I am about starting my journey north. I'll have to admit this is likely the biggest adventure I have ever undertaken. I know I had promised a layout of the gear I'm taking but I'm going to have to postpone that for a few days. I can't wait to get to the Hiker Hostel so I can relax and get some of these nerves out of my system.,,Midnight Train to GA,"Mar 01, Wed",0
Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555477,"Finally made it to the Hiker Hostel. The train was a wonderful way to travel, I went to sleep in VA and woke up in GA. The Hiker Hostel doesn't disappoint one bit. It is a wonderful place to begin an epic adventure. This really has been my first experience talking with other perspective thru-hikers and I'm amazed at the diversity. There are people from all over the country and Europe here and everyone has been amazingly helpful and friendly. It is such a positive atmosphere here and it really helps fortify my decision to begin this journey. Tomorrow my goal is to make it to Hawk Mountain Shelter at mile 8.1 according to my handy dandy guide. Wish me luck. Also for those of you that have instagram feel free to check in on me @whereswhompus I feel so very lucky to be able to do this and thank all of you that have commented and emailed. Your advice and encouragement is greatly appreciated.",,Hiker Hostel ,"Mar 02, Thu",0
Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555691,"Was a pretty good first day. I got dropped off at base of Springer around 10:30am hiked to the top and did the customary photo shoot. I've met so great people so far and I feel so privileged to be able to do this hike. Of course, my calf muscles may not agree. I got to my campsite and had just enough energy left to set up my tent and I was out like a light. I can't thank the Hiker Hostel enough for such a wonderful start to my hike. They are really great people. Tomorrow it's on to Gooch Mountain Campsite. I'm looking forward to warmer nights ahead. My only regret so far was not bringing a warmer sleeping bag. If you want additional updates between posts you can follow me on instagram @whereswhompus Happy Trails!","Hiker Hostel

Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555881,"Had an early start out of Hawk Mountain and I will have to admit it was a rough day. So fairly difficult climbs including Sassafras Mountain. Justis was rough as well but I'm not sure if it was Justis or if it was because I had just finished Sassafras. I've read that there are good days and bad days on the trail, this was one of those days that make you question all you decisions up to this point. The learning curve on the AT is pretty steep and like so many before me I'm feeling it. I still feel privileged to be out here but my thoughts have went from getting to Maine to just getting to the next tree. I've had a hard time eating the last two days and I've only had enough energy to set up my tent and good to sleep. Tomorrow is looking like it's going to be a better day so I'm hopefully for good weather and good terrain. Happy Trails!","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555883,"I felt a little broken this morning. I had some real condensation problems last night and woke up soaked and cold. Still having some problems eating. I'm having to force down Clif bars. I hear that's supposed to change later on but for now it's difficult. I hiked today to Woody Gap were I saw Josh from the Hiker Hostel who came over and told me there was a cancellation at the Hostel if I wanted a bed. I swear I could have kissed that man. So now I'm showered, fed, and am sitting here in clean clothes loving every minute of it. I swear it's like the trail knows when you're down and sends you a miracle to pick you up. The trail provides.","Gooch Mountain Campsite

Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555884,"Got dropped off at 9am and I'm feeling like a completely new man. It's funny how a shower and a good nights sleep will completely change you prospective. I had a great days hike. Preacher Rock is about a mile from Woody Gap and offered the best view so far. My pictures don't do justice to the beauty of it all. It was almost overwhelming. Meet so many wonderful people so far and I'm convinced that the best people on earth are on the Appalachian Trail. Tonight I'm staying at the iconic Blood Mountain Shelter. Man, i feel blessed to be out here and chasing my dreams like this. This is the best decision of my life. Thank you to everyone that's emailed or commented. It means a lot to me.","Woody Gap

Whompus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555911,"Descended from Blood Mountain Shelter into Neel's Gap this morning. A nice 2.4 mile, rough on the knees, hike into Mountain Crossings Outfitter. It was nice to run into friends who were zeroing today and I got to hang out with Mammoth. Mammoth is one of those guys you'd wish your daughter would date. Great kid. Full of concern for everyone around him. Truly loves the outdoors. I'm staying the night at Blood Mountain Cabins and it feels like I'm living in a palace. I'll likely zero tomorrow before heading on shooting for Low Gap Shelter. For now though I'm gonna nom this pizza. Life is good.","Blood Mountain Shelter
