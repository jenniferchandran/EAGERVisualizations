Bamboo Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567158,"A very long Amtrak ride to Washington and then Harpers Ferry.  Luckily, I met O2, who is also going to Harpers Ferry to do a long AT hike.  So we trail-talked while waiting and then on the leg to Harpers Ferry.  Conversation made the time zoom by.  Unfortunately, he is going NOBO.  I gave him our contact info, so we can help him out when he gets to VT.",,Harpers Ferry,"Jun 01, Thu",0
Bamboo Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567160,"I totally overdid it--17.1 miles.  I'm exhausted.  Tough time putting up the tent.  No appetite.  I saw 55 people today, all going the other way.  I hiked down to Blackburn Trail Center to get water--a steep downhill.  They had a bunkhouse, but I decided to hike back up to the trail rather than do it in the morning.  Tenting at Communications Tent Site..  Some people are making a movie here.","Harpers Ferry
