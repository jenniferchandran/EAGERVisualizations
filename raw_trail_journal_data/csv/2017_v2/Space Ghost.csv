Space Ghost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481336,Hello everyone. I joined last week as Dr. Evil. Decided to change trailname to Brother Grimm. More imaginative and it fits. Still hoping for Apr. 13 start. We will see. Talk to you later.,"

Space Ghost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/488091,"Been awhile since I've posted. It's because I haven't had anything to report. Unfortunately my ankle will not co-operate and 2015 is off. It seems to be tarsal tunnel syndrome and needs surgery. a nerve on inside of right ankle is being compressed and causing pain and burning sensation. it could be caused by bone spur, bone abnormality, varicosed vein or who knows. I've been pretty down about it, but it is what it is. I'm going to more doctors and see what next step is. I refuse to believe that this cannot be fixed. Like most of you reading this, once you decide to do this it becomes a little bit of an obsession, so shooting for 2016!   ","

Space Ghost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535701,"Well, 2016 went by the wayside as I had to have ankle surgery in December of 2015. Planning for 2017! I am walking about 4 miles a day right now (on pavement) and so far doing ok. I also purchased bicycle recently and have been riding that quite a bit too. I still need one more minor surgery on a neuroma on right foot, but it should be fine. I still haven't actually put on the backpack with some weight and walked with it, but that will happen pretty soon. I am a multi-state truck driver, I bring the bicycle with me so I can jump out and hit the roads with it when time allows. It is obviously different muscle groups than walking, but is still good for legs, and certainly cardio. As a driver, your legs get very tight and weak so when I have more legwork to do than many. It's getting better though. I got on the A/T twice and did just a few hours on it last month, just to get a taste of it. Once, near I-40, once near I-77, both locations were fairly hilly but not really hard. It was gorgeous. I've seen it all from the big roads, now I want to see it from the woods!",,prep,"May 30, Mon",0
Space Ghost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542554,"Been out training a bit on A/T for 2017. Hiked about 12 miles near Elkton, VA , around 12 miles near Waynesboro, VA , about 6 miles near and also around 6 miles near Mt. Aetna, MD and about 5 miles near Pearisburg, Va. Haven't had time to do any overnights yet, but at least I'm getting some good experience on how strenuous the trail can be! Beautiful scenery everywhere I hiked. Met several cool people. I've been rehabbing ankle surgery and so far the ankle us doing allright! Still planning on 2017 NB thru-hike!!","prep

Space Ghost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542562,"Haven't checked in much lately. As I've said, had ankle surgery in Dec. 2015, it was a Tarsal Tunnel Release surgery. The ligaments, tendons, bones were never really the problem so I luckily do NOT have instability in the ankle. It was nerve pain. After three+ years of problems, I think I finally have it corrected! I was somewhat discouraged a few monthes ago but now I think it's getting better for real. I had to just get out and walk regardless of pain, because resting it was making it worse. I drive a truck over the road, so whenever possible I've been getting out and walking and biking. Luckily, I got to VA several times in the last month or so, which has allowed me to get on the A/T! Elkton, Waynesboro, and Pearisburg. Actually the ankle has done very well! Actually, my back and hips have had some pain but it's expected, after all I'm 52, 60 pounds overweight, and have been a driver for the last 13 years! Can't wait for 2017 because this is going to finally be the time for me to do it. So far I must admit I've only carried a small knapsack with just water and bug spray, and my hiking poles. Unfortuntely, I broke one of them doing something stupid near Pearisburg. Live and learn. So far I have Black Diamond carbon poles, a ULA Circuit pack, Western Mtn. winter bag, and Merrell shoes. Had good results so far with the Merrells and Merino wool socks, but I realize I haven't really worked that hard yet. Hope in Sept. to do a 3-4 day trek up near Elkton, VA . Thinking about going with tarp and hammock but not sure yet. Look forward to mid-March 2017!","

Space Ghost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544530,"Saving up some cash for my 2017 NB thru-hike! Still rehabbing ankle from Dec. 2015 surgery, it's doing pretty good. I set up an automatic withdrawal every week from my paycheck to save money for trail. $125 a week. By next March I should have about $4800 set aside. That along with a car I might sell if need be should be plenty, I don't plan on suffering from lack of funds out there! That being said, that doesn't mean I am staying in hotels or eating out all the time either, because I want to experience the trail, not the towns. Still not sure if I'm going to hammock or not. I do have troublesome right shoulder, and it doesn't take kindly to being on hard ground so hammock might be the ticket. I have been doing what walking I can, in between driving a truck. Some days I have no time. Also, a good amount of biking. I can't wait for spring!","

Space Ghost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552214,"At home in Laporte, IN. Winter is upon us, hard to get any walking in , obviously it can be done but hard to get motivated to hike in the cold! I have decided to do flip-flop hike in 2017. Starting in Front Royal maybe and going north, then back to F.R. and go south. Not interested in hiking with 20 year old drunks in a bubble at Springer, and crowded annoying shelters. I did 3 day practice hike from Daleville, VA down to Four Pines Hostel in mid-October, it was really good. Saw quite a few SOBO thru-hikers, and it was a weekend so lots of day hikers, especially at MacAfee Knob. I stayed at Lamberts and Catawba shelters. Both had bear boxes. Good stream near Lamberts, but just a trickle at Catawba. Catawba probably dries up quite a bit. My Merrell shoes did well, but obviously didn't really push it too hard. Shelters are smaller than I pictured. I think I should go hammock. Stealth camping in tent might be a chore because there are a lot of miles where I didn't see level ground anywhere! I encourage anyone to take a little practice run like this, or longer if possible, you will learn a lot. Of course, the terrain is gorgeous and the weather was perfect! 65 during the days, and about 45 at night. Perfect. Still need to buy more gear, stalled out on question of hammock OR tent?","

Space Ghost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553199,"Getting exited about leaving. Just had foot surgery though, to remove a Morton's Neuroma. Stitches out, and within a few weeks will be fine. Just ordered tent from Lightheart Gear, it's called a Solong, very light, lots of hikers have used them. Ordered a few more odds and ends I will need, like a buff, a wool beanie, a whistle, a Tyvek wallet and a few other things. Only thing left really is a summer bag or quilt, and more clothing. Already got an Amtrak ticket from South Bend, IN to Harpers Ferry, WV. (flip flop hike) on Apr.17! Still working and banking more money till then. See you fellow flipfloppers on the trail!","
