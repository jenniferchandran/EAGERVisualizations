Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552738,"Well, here we are! Plane tickets are purchased and bus routes arranged for my arrival in GA where I plan to start my hike on the Appalachian Trail.It's been almost exactly six years ago since the idea to hike some 2,200 miles was planted in my mind. And just about every year since then, family and friends have heard me say ""This year is the year!"" until something inevitably came up and pushed my plans back. Not this year. I created a severe budget (and stuck with it), I started collecting the gear, and I struck the plans in stone. March 23rd I will be heading to Amicalola Falls for the southern terminus of the trail! For as long as my feet will carry me, I will head North with the hope of reaching the end of the trail at Mt. Katahdin, Maine. I'll be hiking with thousands of others who share the same aspiration with a backpack, a tent, and a small assortment of essential pieces of equipment. I will walk through all kinds of weather, in 14 different states, hundreds of peaks, through rivers, quaint little towns, and I'm sure with a few surprises along the way. In all, it should take 4-6 months to complete. I don't have a great track record of keeping a journal with my previous travels, but I hope to have a little something for each day on the trail. The plan is to update when I reach town every once or twice a week. I'll write a couple more blogs before I head out too. I hope you all follow along with me!",,I'm hiking the AT!,"Dec 29, Thu",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552999,"Last year I was travelling around the world with a bag that weighed under 40 lbs. I was really proud to have everything I needed to live packed so light. This year, on the AT, I will be carrying under 20 lbs! If you’re interested in what I’ll be taking along with me on my hike read on. I’ll go through the basic idea of everything I have and why I choose my stuff. I definitely tried to go light-weight, but I would definitely not be accepted among the inner-circles of the ultralight elite. I considered not only weight, but cost, practicality, and a little bit of comfort .Pack:Osprey Atmos 50 Litre Osprey is a trusted brand for a reason! I have used this pack all over the world and it has treated me well. A little bit of chafing for me on the hips, but that just might be user error. I don’t have the AG system which from what I understand is a nice upgrade from the older models. I have not opted for a rain cover as most of my gear will be carried in dry-bags and I’ve not had great experiences with rain covers in the past (they are very limited in their usefulness). This will contain my livelihood for the next few months, neat!Camping Gear:Tent: MSR HubbaSleeping Bag: Big Agnes Lost Lake 30 Degree BagSleeping Pad: Exped UL7 DownmatThis is the essential stuff isn’t it? I’ll spend a good time of my hike in my own shelter. Though I tried to be cost effective in most of my gear, it was no expense spared in this category. MSR has provided me with two great tents. I have the original Hubba tent, as well as their new generation Hubba Hubba NX. They have both been very good to me. They have held up well in the elements, are lightweight, and very easy to set-up. My sleeping bag is some mixture of synthetic and down? It’s got the qualities of down but with moisture wicking so that I can keep its insulating abilities if moisture collects on it. The Exped UL7 is very nice! Great insulation from the ground and packs very small and light. It’s a little bit of work to set up, but with an intuitive inflation system you can be done in a couple of minutes or less.Clothes:Baselayer Top & Bottom: REI Lightweight baselayerShirt : REI Sahara TeeConvertible Pants: Columbia SilverridgeUnderwear: Exoficio boxers (x2)Shoes : Vasque Breeze III GTX Midsize BootSocks: Darn Tough Micro CrewLiner Socks: REI Merino WoolRain Jacket: Mamot PreCipInsulating Jacket: Rab Xenon XClothes seems to make up a lot of the gear, but in reality, most of it will be worn not carried. Went with as few clothes as I was comfortable with, but could still keep me warm if I need to layer up. Of course, the most important piece of gear here is the shoes. I’ve worn vasque in the past and they’ve held up very well in some hard hiking conditions. I’ve been breaking in the Breeze III for the trail, and I find them immediately comfortable. I hope they last me a long time! I can’t tell you too much about the clothes. The biggest decision I remember having to make is whether I wanted a lightweight or midweight baselayer. I went with lightweight to save a considerable amount of money, and I’m glad I did. I went hiking in 20 degree weather and was sweating! Other than that, I’m real excited to wear some trendy convertible pants. As I say, it separates the men from the boys, and pants from the shorts. Cookware:Stove: Snowpeak LiteMaxFuel: 110g Giga PowerCup: Snowpeak Titanium 450ml Single-WallPot: Evernew Titantium Non-Stick 900mlWater: Sawyer FilterBladder: Geigerrig Hydration SystemSpork: S2S Alpha LightI feel like this is the standard gear for any thru-hikers cookset! A lot of my gear research continually came back to these brands. Evernew had the only non-stick titanium pot I could find, hopefully it works nicely! The geigerrig system is very nice if a little bit less minimalistic compared to other bladders. I enjoy being able to utilize the bladder to spray things (maybe a little shower here and there or a convenient way to clean wounds). If you want to go ultra-lightweight you can do a no-cook hike and ditch the stove and fuel in exchange for some granola bars I guess? Not for me, I want more food options!Misc Gear:Camera: Sony RX100 V (Very excited to use this more!)Hiking Poles: Black Diamond Distance Z PolesCompass: Silva ForecasterMed-Kit: Adventure Medical Kits Med Kit .3Pocket KnifeToiletries (Wet-naps, small toothbrush, travel size toothpaste, sunscreen, etc…)Trail-Guide: AWOL’s AT GuideHeadlamp: PetzlAll of this is pretty standard I would say. More and more people are ditching the guidebook and using their phones to download guides. I don’t have a smartphone so I will be using the good ol paper maps. Notable purchases here are the Black Diamond Distance Z poles and the Sony RX100. I went with a cheaper option for the hiking poles, and the Distance Z won in value definitely. I’m also a fan of being able to fold them up when necessary. I got the newest model of the sony RX100 series, and it was well worth the money! Takes quality shots and is super compact. Hope I don’t give it to much of a beating . Final Thoughts…:I wouldn’t call myself a gear freak by any means, but I’ve found spending my time looking at all the different options is a great way to pass the time as I grow near my hike. My advice to anyone who is looking at buying gear for hiking whether you’re a thru-hiker, section-hiker, or day-hiker, is to do your research… but don’t sweat it too much. Look back twenty years at what people were carrying then and you’ll see gear has come a long long way. With the surge in the popularity of hiking, there’s also been a proportionate increase in people that want to make better gear. With so much out there it’s hard to go wrong. Don’t feel guilty if your pack is not under 10 lbs or whatever the bar is set for ultra-lightweight packing. Packing light definitely makes it easier on you, but many have finished with much much heavier packs. Speaking of which, I have not kept super close track of my total weight as I don’t have any scales or such to utilize at home. I estimate my base gear is around 15-16 pounds carried. There are a few small things I omitted, and there will probably be yet a few changes I make in the coming months. I think I hit the main things though. I’d be happy to try and answer any questions about gear, or if you have any major suggestions for me I’d love to hear it. Whew, that’s a lot of typing. Don’t plan on doing that again. I hope it’s insightful/helpful for some!",,Gear List,"Jan 06, Fri",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553190,"“The woods were full of peril—rattlesnakes and water moccasins and nests of copperheads; bobcats, bears, coyotes, wolves, and wild boar; loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex; rabies-crazed skunks, raccoons, and squirrels; merciless fire ants and ravening blackfly; poison ivy, poison sumac, poison oak, and poison salamanders; even a scattering of moose lethally deranged by a parasitic worm that burrows a nest in their brains and befuddles them into chasing hapless hikers through remote, sunny meadows and into glacial lakes.” - Bill Bryson, A Walk in the WoodsAs I’ve told more and more people about my trip, I get the inevitable questions about bear attacks, crazy ax murderers, and getting swept off the mountains by a freak gale. They are all genuine concerns, and I appreciate the concern and the thought that people want to look out for me. In reality, those things that seem to spell inevitable doom for any wishing to attempt a thru-hike as Bryson puts it, don’t really worry me. Bears don’t seem to bother people on the AT and I feel like I’m as likely to get murdered anywhere else as on the trail. But, I thought I would take the opportunity to lay out some of my personal fears and concerns for the coming year.The one trail hazard that I do want to be vigilant about is the weather. Winds commonly knock trees over, you can be exposed to lightning on some of the ridges, and rainy/snowy conditions put you at risk for hypothermia if you’re not careful. Not all of this can be avoided (last year a tree fell on a shelter), but with preparation and awareness, you can be smart and keep yourself out of harms way. I’ll have a compass, clothes plenty warm enough, fire-starters, and a trail-guide all to keep me informed and on the trail safely. My health is also a big concern going into this trip. My age does not seem to reflect my body sometimes. I’ve had minor issues with my knee since running a race late 2015. I’ve been to the doctor, who didn’t seemed to concerned and offered me some stretches and exercises to follow to keep it healthy, but the pain is there all the same. I’ve not had any issues hiking on it so far, and I still have my full range of motion. That being said, I’m afraid to see where I’ll be at a few weeks in. My plan is to take it slow to start and keeping stretched out. I also have minor issues with my back and shoulders, but they seem to be non-factors when I’m hiking.And like any good vagabond, one of my other concerns is money. It’s no secret that I do not live a very profitable lifestyle travelling very often, and that means I’m not going onto the trail with much wriggle room in my budget. On the flip side, I have a lot of practice living the “budget” lifestyle. I don’t think I’m too bad at it . I might not get to sleep at the nice hotels when I hit town all the time, but I feel confident I have enough to make it through the trail. All risks and concerns considered, I’m still very optimistic about my time on the trail. My goal is to thru-hike the entire trail, but I know there are somethings that are out of my control. I am here chasing after one of my dreams, and that’s what I care about. I’m willing to take the risks knowing that failure is a very real possibility. If that happens, it happens. I’ll reassess and try again or move onto something else. We’ll hope I don’t have to worry about that. Here’s to a long and happy hike .",,Trail Fears,"Jan 11, Wed",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553458,"I enjoy a good book here and there, and I wanted to share some of the books that have inspired my AT Hike. I think they're great reads in general, but especially if you're looking for motivation for the trail!
A Walk in the Woods - Bill Bryson
This book seems to be the quintessential AT book. Bryson blends his humor, wit, and history in his well written account of his own AT hike. 
AWOL on the Appalachian Trail - David Miller
Miller's book is more focused, journal-like account of the AT hike. He shares the details, logistics, and how he became inspired to hike the trail (and the change that brought in his life). A bit more dry of a read, but I'd recommend it to any would-be hiker.
Into the Wild - Jon Krakauer
Practically holy writing to anyone who consider themselves the wandering type, Into the Wild is a great look into story and the mind of Christopher McCandless. Despite his terrible end, McCandless with the help of Krakauer's writing awoke a desire in many to leave the world as they know it behind and live with less. This book takes a look both at what it cost Chris (along with his life) and what he gained.
Fire Season - Philip Connors
Connors shares his experience as an outlook in a firetower in the Gila Wilderness. This book is not about hiking, though he does spend a little time talking about thru-hikers, but more about his experience with solitude in nature. I found this sentiment nice:
""I do not so much seek anything as allow the world to come to me, allow the days to unfold as they will, the dramas of weather and wild creatures. I am most at peace not when I am thinking but when I am observing. There is so much to see, a pleasing diversity of landscapes, all of them always changing in new weather, new light, and all of them still and forever strange to a boy from the northern plains. I produce nothing but words; I consume nothing but food, a little propane, a little firewood. By being virtually useless in the calculations of the culture at large I become useful, at last, to myself""
Walden - Henry Thoreau
Speaking of solitude... I have always found Thoreau's writings very insightful. Of particular interest to any hiker is his writings in ""Economy"". Simply stated he says the more stuff you have, the more stuff you have to take care, and the less time you have to understand and pursue who you are yourself. Interesting to anyone who plans on living out of a backpack for several months.
The Outermost House - Henry Beston
The Outermost House is another book about the solitude our author finds in a cabin this time built on a beach in New England. What I appreciate especially in this book is the appreciation Beston has for everything nature provides around him. The way the sand is shaped by the sea, how much he learned from the way breakers look, and all the life that found it's way on the beach.
A Sand County Almanac - Aldo Leopold
I can't say enough good things about this book. One of Wisconsin's greatest treasures. I would argue he is the greatest conservationist for not only on the way he changed thinking in ecology, but in also the action he took to preserve wilderness in America. While the AT is definitely not the Wilderness that Leopold talks about, he elevates the idea that it is natural for man experience nature and wilderness. It's also important to anyone who is going to spend months in the woods why ""Leave No Trace"" is vital to the trails and parks we visit.
Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage - Alfred Lansig
This incredibly well-written book is about Ernest Shackleton and his crew being stranded in the Antarctic. For 21 months 28 men were stranded in some of the most uninhabitable climates Earth has to offer. Every man survived. It's one of my favorite stories and is shared well by Lansig. What I found most striking about this book is the optimism the crew had in such grim circumstance. Their optimism should be inspiration to anyone who has a difficult journey ahead of them, and that's why it made this list.

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554239,"I can't go on this trip without mentioning the man who planted the idea in my head several years ago. His name is ""No Worries"" and I want to talk about how he lead me here, and maybe even say a few nice things about him.No Worries became my boss when I switched to the third-shift at the grocery store I was working at. I don't think you could put together a more interesting group of characters. I played the fresh college dropout ready for a career in bottom of the barrel jobs. There was the janitor who was moonlighting as a DJ at a strip-club, the mad-scientist cashier who would mix any chemicals he could get his hands on in the name of a clean (if made unusable by mixing bleach and ammonia) bathroom, the career shelf-stocker who took gossip magazines in the bathroom for lord-knows-why and who-knows-how-long each night, the registered sex offender who pissed himself in order to get out of work, and finally No Worries their charismatic leader. Whether he saw great potential in my work ethic or wanted to ease me into the insane world of graveyard-shift grocery stores, No Worries took me under his wing. It didn't take long to figure out that he was a rare kind of guy. He had this knack for breathing life into everything, even a dead-end job like switching out the old cans of cat food with the new ones. I started hearing all about stories of the Appalachian Trail; his brushes with lightning on mountaintops, the strange community it brought together, and how it changed his life. He had hiked it 3 times, once a complete thru. I had never heard of the trail let alone someone who would have their life revolve around it. For a young guy like me it, in introduced a complete paradigm shift in what I thought life was supposed to be like. NoWorries didn't just share some interesting stories, he brought with them a fire for life, a genuine optimism to my cheap cynicism. It didn't take long before I shared the desire to go for a good walk myself. To figure out what life might be really about, to live for more than the status quo. I have my friend, NW, to thank for that. Though he would never admit it, he's one of the good guys, and I'm glad our paths crossed.",,No Worries,"Feb 06, Mon",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557231,"Here we are! I'm headed to Chicago in a few hours for my flight tomorrow. I'll land in Atlanta and take a Greyhound from there to Gainesville, GA. I've heard nothing but... great things about Greyhounds in America. I have friends in Gainesville so I'll be staying with them an extra day or two before I actually hit the trail. In honor of No Worries, I will start my trip off with a zero day. Saturday I should hit the trail in earnest. Some final thoughts before I finally start... I'm neither very nervous or excited as of right now. Last night I slept the sleep of death and it was great. Maybe having traveled a lot up to this point I'm used to it? One thing I know as I've reflected on what's to come is that whether this trip ends up as a great success or great failure (i'll consider anything less than 1,000 miles that) I'm very glad to having tried and chased after one of my dreams. I've done a lot of things in my life because I'm supposed to do them. It feels nice to do something that's a little bit more out there, something that I know was meant for me. A few more hours and I will be on my way. See ya",,Day Zero,"Mar 22, Wed",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558126,"I learned some humility today. Started at Amicalola Falls around 11 A.M. (thanks Andrea for the ride!). Checked in and had a gear ""shakedown."" ATC workers Rachel and Bob critiqued the amount of food I brought, but the gear looked good which gave me a hearty confidence boost. That was short-lived.The approach trail to the AT starts flat. Feeling good I started with a brisk pace. Then, I learned of the infamous approach staircase. There are 604 stairs leading to the top of a beautiful waterfall that forms a kind of switchback structure. It took me only 100 steps, this is a under a mile of my journey mind you, to become completely winded. I took a 5 minute break on a bridge overlooking the falls and pretended I was enjoying the view when in reality I was trying to keep my heart from beating itself to death against my ribcage. After my little break I walked another 5 minutes or so before I had to stop again. This time I found a bench and met my first thru-hiker Hampton! We took a another break and pushed on together. This time I made it all of 2 minutes before I had to break. Our partnership was short lived.
In dramatic fashion I bid Hampton ""Go on without me!"" or something to that effect. He began to press on the 400 stairs or so we had left while my body finally got the best of me and violently expelled my breakfast 30 ft over the railing. It was a sight to see I'm sure, and I have a feeling I stopped a few people from ever dreaming of doing the AT again. That being said, that's what my body wanted to do and I felt much better after all that!
I took a few more minutes of rest and then powered through the stairs. I met back up with Hampton and with hiked the rest of the day together. It was real nice to have a conversation buddy, and he swapped some pretty good stories with me. I'm glad to have met him!
We made it to Springer Mtn Shelter with about 20 other hikers there as well. Met 4 other Wisconsinites which is pretty neat!. I also met Gavin (now two-times on account of having doubled back on the approach), Lydia (Radagast) a ridge-runner I'm madly in love with, and several other thru-hikers whose name I can't remember. They were all really great!
Rumor is that a big storm is coming through after tomorrow. Looks like I'll be hiking in the rain! I have plenty of photos but they'll have to come later when I find a computer to upload them. It's beautiful here.","Amicalola Falls

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558128,"Mud everywhere. It wasn't the storm that was predicted last night, but did rain heavily through the night. Woke up and the rain had died off leaving Springer in mist. I woke up sometime near sunrise and it was gorgeous. Started the day walking alone to try and get used to early starts on my days. Caught up with Sean who's from Texas and walked 4-5 miles with him. We split up at and long creek falls where I stopped to take in the view for a while. Met up with Two Times again and talked for a little while but I was stopping often to take photos so I lost him pretty quickly. The rain had left a sheen on everything in the woods. I couldn't resist stopping every few minutes to take in each postcard view.
Set up camp early in the hopes of getting my body ready for a big day of mileage tomorrow. Risked washing my clothes despite on again and off again rain. The sun was making a comeback for a little while, but so far the risk is not paying off. May be hiking in some wet pants tomorrow. 
Weather was about 95% cloudy and rainy in the morning. More rain expected through the night and day tomorrow.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558131,"It's amazing that so much seems to happen when all you're really doing is hiking! I'm too lazy to do the math but I must have done 3,000 ft in uphill elevation alone. Woke around 7 again to get going on my long day. I hiked alone but was leap-frogging with another thru-hiker Bags and his dog Sibbie. It was another cloudy and rainy morning. Early on I crossed over the crest of a ridge and mistook the roaring sound of a water crashing for a waterfall. In reality it was a downpour that was kind enough to give me some warning before it hit me, but I did not heed it. It was only 30 seconds, but it was enough to be pretty well soaked. I was bummed to be all wet, but it worked out for the good as I had some tough climbing. It was really nice to have rain cooling me off, so I kept my rain jacket off all day. 
Stopped at Gooch Gap where I met Larry and Frank. They were some genuine guys I enjoyed talking to. I hope we meet again! After lunch, I pressed on through some more beautiful scenery. Here I started to see the first few signs of life breaking through the ground.
Feeling pretty tired having gone through some difficult elevation I was uplifted with my first run-in with trail magic at Woody Gap. Doc and Sacajawea, who had set up a table full of beer, candy, and my favorite: pizza. They had thru-hiked last year and wanted to show their love to this years hikers. It was glorious! I also ran into a group of folks shooting a commercial. They gave me chocolate. Aw yea. Met up with Bags and Sibbie again here. Sibbie's hatred for me continued as she threatened to end my journey with a good nip at my calf. She's half German-Shepard and half timberwolf, and could have done some damage if she wanted to, but I was fine. I'll win her love yet.
Made it to Lance creek somewhere around 7 PM. There were tons of people camping here on account of the next 10 miles having camping restrictions due to bear activity. I was pooped so I set up camp and went right to bed after dinner. This is definitely the most I've ever hiked in one go. I feel pretty good about it! I'll take it easier tomorrow. The rainy streak is expected to continue tomorrow.","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558133,"Todays major events were Blood Mountain and Neels Gap. Last night was a strong storm with constant lightning and a good downpour, but I stayed relatively dry. Especially compared to some of the other hikers who got a little drenched.I woke up to a beautiful sunrise, a first for my trip with all the rain. I knew I had Blood Mountain ahead of me and at 1,500 ft elevation uphill I was a little intimidated. I expected a rough hike for the day. What I did not expect was the hike up to be not-so-difficult, but the descent to be brutal.I made it to the top of Blood Mtn and was kind of shocked to have made it there pretty easily. I hiked up with Aaron, Dan, and Peter and had some good conversation with them. They're fellow geeks. Now the downhill was something fierce. It was 50% boulders and slick from the past few days of rain. It was difficult to navigate and slippery. It was the hardest hiking I've done so far. However, I heard rumor of pizza in Neel, and that helped me push through to the bottom.Neel's gap was practically paradise. There was an outfitter there, but more important there was frozen pizza and doritos. I ate pizza until I felt sick and then chatted with all the other hikers stopped there. They were mostly new faces. I haven't seen too many folks from my day 1 stop anymore. I met Jellybeans, Tator-Tot, Stone Cold, Chelsea, Avalanche and Rodrick. Met up with Bags again in our typical leap-frog fashion. Sibbie still does not like me. She has a week or so left on the trail before Bags has some one pick her up to take care of her while he hikes on. Neels gap was a great time! Loved eating some non-trail food and meeting some interesting people.I hiked on a few more miles past Neels where Bags caught up with me at watersource. There was a nice spot so we both decided to camp there for the night. There was reports of active bears snooping around, so I was certainly happy to have Sibbie around. Bags shared some of his goodies with me which was really nice!Tomorrow will be another longer day, but with some easier territory. My first blister has shown up on the back of my left heel. It's not painful. I didn't notice it until I took my socks off. I'll be keeping my eye on it. I plan on stopping in Hiawasee in 2 days for my first town stop!","Lance Creek

Woke up to absolutely clear skies and a stunner of a mountain sunrise. Stayed around camp a little longer today to enjoy coffee, breakfast and the weather and left around 9. Bags was just waking up as I was leaving, hopefully we'll cross paths again!The plan was to get to Blue mountain shelter about 16 miles away, so I can get into Hiawassee early tomorrow morning. There were a couple rough uphills and downhills with some brutal switchbacks to Hog Pen Gap, but it evened out nicely after that. There are reports of Norovirus in some of the water so I went a good 8 miles before I filled up. I was running pretty dry before I found a good spot to get some water. Was leap-frogging with Ryan a little ways, but his pace ended up being much faster than mine.Stopped for lunch at Low-Gap shelter. Caught up with Ryan there and had lunch with him. Another great guy. Also found Joey, the only guy I've seen from my day 1 crew. Also met up with Yak who I would hike with for the rest of the day. The trail from Low Gap was all very gradual and easy-hiking. Loved it! Joey, Ryan, and Trudy set up camp a couple miles down while Yak and I pressed on. Yak's another good one. Seems to be a running theme on the trail.We hit Blue Mountain Shelter around 6 PM. Talked with some of the funniest people I have ever met. They had my stomach hurting from laughing so hard.

Sounded like it was going to be more fun today, but it's the trail for me. Getting on the shuttle taking me back to Unicoi Gap was like a scene from Benny Hill. Jeff tried to jump into our completely packed bus while the driver told him he couldn't. Driver gets out to tell him while Jeff walks around the other side and hops in. It was a whole ordeal and maybe I was a little rude to be laughing so much. Ultimately Jeff got off and had to catch the next shuttle. See ya Jeff!Unicoi Gap is where I've hiked in the past and I recognized it right away. Shaped up to be a real beautiful day. There was one particularly beautiful passage I remember. Right now in Spring you are walking mostly through bare tree and brush, which is beautiful in its own right. Today I was treated to a green passage that seemingly popped out of nowhere into being around the currently sedated forest. The trail led into a corridor-like section of brush that lined on either side of the tree. The branches arched over the trail and met in the middle with the green leaves forming a thick canopy. Early morning sunlight ran off the leaves and dripped onto the bright green-gold moss that trimmed the trail edge. It all gave the impression of the approach to some royal throne or court. The fragrance in the air was thick with the sweetness of new blossoms mixed with last years autumn floam. The birds heralded each step along the path. I'm very lucky to be out here !After walking through some amazing woods, I received the best of trail magic at Trey Gap from some boy scouts. They gave us eggs, pancakes, sausage, oj, burgers, coffee, fresh water, a fire and even let me play their guitar. I could not have asked for more. It was awesome, thanks guys!Hike continued on beautifully. Swag of the Blue Mountain was a memorable uphill hike. I'm camping in the same spot as I did the last time I was here with the Men of the World Race. Neat!","Hiawassee

Rumor is that nice weather streak will end tomorrow with a big storm. Chance of hail. Bring it on!Hiked with Yak again today. Joined up with Gumby and Backtrack too.

I had to stop more than any other uphill I've done yet. I think gathering rain in my pack and fighting the wind had something to do with that.Made it 3 miles to the next shelter relatively dry. Stopped there for a second breakfast and ran into the girls from Hiawassee. They decided to 0 there. I considered calling it a day there but decide to press on to try and beat the worst of the weather that was supposed to hit later.The hike to Standing Indian was mild and only took me 1 and a half hours to finish. However, I did not beat the worst of the storm and was completely soaked by the time I got there. Other hikers were not happy about all the wetness I brought into the shelter. Couldn't help it, sorry! More and more people were trying to fit under the shelter awning and no one had set up their tent so I decided to brave the rain and be the first to set up mine.I'm not too well practiced at setting up my tent yet, and with the wind blowing everything around the setup got pretty wet. My whole body was shaking from the cold by the time I was done. After that though, I was able to change into dry clothes and warm up in my sleeping bag, woohoo! Weather will remain cold, but it is rumored that the rain will clear up.

Got to hiking and was all warmed up in about an hour. The trail was very gradual today. Even though I hit 5.5k ft elevation today, the trail brought you up slowly over a couple miles. No harsh downhills either. I could get used to that!Walked through some very fire-damaged areas. A stark contrast to some of the scenes in GA. The earth is scorched black on either side of the trail and lined with dead trees. Did get my first great view of N.C. however!Betty Creek was a perfect place to stop. Very pretty area.

If you hike the AT, you're going to hike in the rain. The saying goes: ""No Pain, no rain, no Maine.""A few miles in I hit Albert Mountain. It's another one of those straight up elevations and one of the tallest points I've hiked so far at 5250 ft. It was full of many bare spots of boulders that sometimes even required climbing with your hands. Naturally as soon as I hit the bottom of Albert Mountain, one of the most dangerous places I could be in a storm, the lightning came. Being as exposed as I was on the mountain I kicked into overdrive and hiked as fast as I could. I survived!Using the momentum from pushing uphill I crushed the rest of my 8.5 mi hike by quarter to 11. Not bad time! The rain continued to come down steadier and steadier and once again I found myself soaked. Rumor was that snow was on the way and that was enough to send me to town.

I was warmed up by breakfast at the church again. Backtrack woke us up to an alarm and told us with complete confidence that the time was 7:20 AM. This was terrible news because the bus for the church left at 7:15 AM. That was by far the most stressful moment for me on the trail so far. It was a false alarm though and we made it just fine.Got back to Rock Gap around 9:30. The temp was about 35 degrees, less with the wind chill. About 30 minutes into the hike we hit the snow and it was the for the rest of the day. It was gorgeous!At Silar Bald I decided to hit the summit off trail to see the view. Most decided to pass on the opportunity because it was tough trek out of the way. But it was so worth it and was easily the best view I had on the trail, and one of the best views I have ever had anywhere. It was clear skies with a 360 view. The fresh snow on the mountains and the frost on the trees took my breath away. Picked the perfect day to get back on the trail!Caught up with Gumby and Backtrack who were dropped off further along the trail. We hiked the rest of the way together up Wayah Bald. Wayah Bald was a good long climb up, but wasn't too steep. The snow did get a little deep up there at points making some slightly more difficult hiking. More beautiful views at the top there. Fires reached up here too and destroyed some of the tower. Hit the shelter soon after and changed straightaway into my long underwear and layered up. It will be a cold night, below 30 forecasted.

It was much less steep than the drop to the NOC. Spring has sprung down here and there is finally lot's of green to see. Wildflowers cover the forest floor in any direction. Trees are sprouting just enough leaves to let through light giving them the appearance of m80s bursting in freeze frame.Fontana is amazing!

Two: The elevation maps in the guidebook can be cruelly deceiving.Last night was definitely my worst nights sleep on the AT. Before the hike I might have guessed bears and mice would be the ones keeping me awake. No. It's the snoring hikers. Last night I heard the most ungodly sounds coming from my fellow hikers. The worst two sounded like a velociraptor and the other reminded me of a whoopie cushion going off every 5 seconds. I did not sleep for more than an hour at a time. Considered packing up and hiking through the night instead of laying through that torture. Next time I probably will. Ryan gave me earplugs this morning so hopefully tonight will go better.Had lunch at Derrick Knob Shelter. Expected the hike to be easier especially relative to yesterday. Instead, though the elevation doesn't change drastically, there were some tough ups and downs. Was pretty tired after only 9 miles, but decided to push on. Thankfully, the second half of my day was much easier. The flowers from yesterday continue onto seeming infinity. Today there seemed to be much more of a fragrance coming from them.

As luck would have it, they skies started darkening and you could here thunder occasionally in the distance. Normally, I love the balds, but today was nothing but bad omens so I set to finish that sucker as quick as possible. It really was gorgeous hiking. Wish I could have spent more time up there. I love that kind of scenery though there wasn't much of a view today.Trail magic made the rest of my day. There was a cooler full of powerade after Big Bald. It was perfectly timed. In my hustle up the bald I hadn't grabbed any water. I was pretty thirsty by then. Not long after a south-bound hiker tipped me off to some trail magic at Spivy Gap. I wasn't expecting much, but it put a little pep in my step. I will say what I found at Spivy Gap goes into something beyond trail magic.

Even if it's not raining heavy, the leaves above collect pools of icy water that wait for you to walk under them. Once you're underneath they spring their trap and you get yourself a nice mini ice bath with a shock. Packing up becomes much more of a chore as you try and fail to keep your stuff from rolling around in the mud. You regretfully just accept that you will be a muddy mess until you get to the next town. The trail itself becomes much worse too. Where it's not a running river constantly threatening to completely soak your feet, it turns to complete muck. Sometimes the muck is 3 inches deeper than it looks or sometimes hidden completely by leaves. On the uphill, for every two steps up you slide back one. On the downhills you can only pray that your footing will hold. Took a good spill or two myself on a downhill, completing my muddy transformation. That's been the trail for the past few days, and it definitely wears at you. Anyways!I hiked with Ghost and Cruiser for the morning. It was nice to have someone to talk to instead of constantly trying to avoid thinking about how crappy the trail is right now. Helped the time move along nicely. They were good company, hope I see more of them. I ate a hearty lunch and powered my way to the highest shelter on the AT at 6200 ft elevation. Only a few hundred short of Clingman's Dome which is the highest point on the AT. It was packed away in a really beautiful conifer grove. The shelter even had a full 4 walls to it which is a first as far as I know! There was a door on it. What an innovation! Here with Pippin, Rocketman, Rock, Greenbeard, Dustbuster, Bartender and I caught a glimpse of Murphy and Kinda as well.","Cherry Gap Shelter

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562593,"Goodbye NC and goodbye rain streak! Today was a great day on the AT. It was a pretty chilly start to the day, but after over a week of overcast weather and rain we finally saw the sun and blue skies! They came on the perfect day too. Our morning hike offered some breathtaking views from the ridgelines. In front of us: fog covered valleys under blue skies while behind: clouds crashed and spilled over the mountaintops we came from. Ran into Toe again up here who jumped up from the rockies to take advantage of todays good weather.I got really hungry and at a massive lunch at 10AM. The hiker hunger is real now, but it got me ready for some challenging uphill. Little Hump and Hump mountain were the big climbs for the day. They were tough but gorgeous climbs all the way through. It was a couple o hours of hiking on a grassy ridge with views the whole way. It reminded me a lot of Entoto Mountain in Ethiopia. it was pretty neat to see hikers far ahead of you and behind you as well.I decided to turn a good day into a great day by eating dinner in Roan Mountain. I ate at Bob's Dairyland it was one of the best decisions I've made on the trail. They fed me the first real hiker burger I've had on the trail. It was truly massive, delicious and for a better price than any other place would offer. You better believe I ate the whole thing and had room for ice cream. I will have to upload a photo of that big boy soon. Every hiker should stop there. Best eating yet for me.After eating that big meal I got talked into staying at a nearby hostel. Stretching my wallet out a little, but the stay at Doe River Hiker Hostel was really nice. Practically got a private room. David who runs the place is great to hikers as well. Recommend staying there if you want to stop. Best hostel I've been to as well. Had I known about this place I would have zeroed here instead of in Erwin. Here with Pippin, Velveeta, Chip and a couple others. Rocketman and Bartender are somewhere in town as well.","Roan High Knob Shelter

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562594,"Outran the rain today! That is to say: despite the high chances for rain, it seemed to miss me. Started out my day with a wonderful breakfast provided by David. Got french toast, sausage, eggs on toast, strawberries and fresh tomatoes. Served with some nice black coffee. Dave knows how to feed the hikers!Hit the trail around 9:30 AM feeling pretty good. Ran into Rock, who I first met at Spivy Gap trail magic, and we hiked most of the day together. It was cool getting to know him. Turns out we both spent some time in Chiang Mai, Thailand which is a neat connection.It was overcast all day which was actually perfect for all the waterfalls we saw. Nice diffuse lighting for pictures :). Jones Falls was gorgeous. Took a nice break there. It was one of the largest waterfalls I've seen, besides Amicalola Falls,  but without all the tourists.Had lunch at mountaineer shelter and though about staying there to ride out the storms that were supposed to be rolling through. Wanted to get to a certain hostel by tomorrow however, so I decided to even out the miles I had to do and pushed for another 10 today. Left Rocketman behind at Mountaineer all on his own. I hope he survives! The rest of the hike took me generally uphill but was pretty mild. Ended up doing 10 miles in about 3 1/2 hours. Got myself a nice shelter spot and will be back at a hostel tomorrow. Look at me glamping!","Roan Mountain, TN

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562595,"Great day on the AT! Got to hiking around 7:30. Woke up to clear skies and fog in the valleys. My favorite! Hit another very large waterfall at Laurel Falls. Lots of people so I didn't linger long. Took a really peaceful lunch break further down the river. Met Odie and Sidetrail who are section hiking to Damascus. They're a really neat couple who run an agro-tourism farm down in Flordia. Pretty neat! I got to hike and talk with them which made for a nice morning. Hit a big mountain at Pond Flats. It was a pretty long climb. In 80 degree heat I ran out of water before I hit the water source at the top. But, I made it, filled my water back up and was on my way. Apparently, not 30 minutes later there was a very large rattler at that exact spot. A little bummed I missed seeing it to be honest!A quick downhill jaunt later and I was at the Boots Off Hostel. It's a really nice place for hikers and for only $10 a camping spot it was a steal. Spent the rest of my day resupplying, chowing down at both McDonalds and Subway (both restaurants not at all ready for an influx of hikers), playing guitar, and hanging around the campfire. A good night! here with Rock, Odie + Sidetrail, Fry, Loose Strap, and a few others.","Moreland Gap Shelter

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562599,"I survived the heat wave! Today was definitely the hottest day on the AT with low wind to boot. Didn't help myself any by getting to a late start. Got caught up chatting and having a nice breakfast at the Hostel. Hard to not linger when there's good coffee to be had! Didn't got on the trail til 10 and by then it was already 80 degreesThis section of the trial brought me around Watauga lake which was a pretty area. Had to take a blue-blaze due to the trail being flooded at some points. Was pleased at the thought this dilemma would create for the hardcore purists out there. I haven't got anything against purists necessarily. It's just that they tend to see themselves as above other hikers. Anyways Watauga was nice, but there are warnings everywhere not to linger due to lots of bear activity. The shelter there has been closed for over a year because of it.A good climb over 10 miles took me up to Vandeventer Shelter. I was bone dry on water at that point so I had no choice but too take the long sidetrail to water there. I did almost a mile of extra steep trail just for 1 Liter of water. I vowed to never drink water again.The heat kicked up to 90 after that and slowed me down quite a bit. Stopped a few miles short of where I wanted to be, but that's alright. Here with Fry, Texas Ranger, 7beer and his dad. Shooting for Damascus tomorrow.","Boots Off Hostel

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562728,"Just like that I'm done with Tennessee and have moved on to Virginia. The trail spends more time in VA than any other state. I'll hike 500+ miles before I cross into another state. People don't always have nice things to say about it, but I'm looking forward to everything Virginia has to offer!Woke up early with Damascus on my mind. Was glad to get moving early as I've made a habit of late starts recently. Much better than starting in the heat of the day. It was a very quiet hike today. Saw a couple of people at the gaps that crossed roads, but not a single thru-hiker until about 16 miles in today. Met Rabbit at Abingdon Gap Shelter. Our meeting was brief as I made another monster descent to get water. She seems like a nice girl. Hope to see her in Damascus.Hitting the border was really exciting! However, having hiked over 20 miles in socks that badly needed washing left my feet more raw and sore than they have ever been. I was too close to Damascus to quit right then so I pressed on. It's one of the more famous trail towns and I've been looking forward to it for some time! Staying at a hostel called ""The Place"" tonight. Only $7 a night. No-brainer.Grabbed a really nice dinner with some of the what we'll call ""Grizzled Vets"" of the trail: Hunter, Growler, Cur Dog, BR, and Grey Eagle. We celebrated Grey Eagle's last day of being the most Senior ranked Colonel in the Marine Corp. Congrats on your retirement Grey Eagle! Hope civilian life treats you well. I was honored to be a part of this great mans night! Had a good time talking with them all. Staying at the Hostel with all of them as well as Ghost and Cruiser who I hadn't seen for a couple of days. Good to see them too. Will be zeroing tomorrow!","Iron Mountain Shelter

Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562729,"Heralding in the month of May with all my town chores! Had breakfast with Grey Eagle and Cur Dog before they hit the trail while also taking care of my laundry. Also made a few new friends at Mojos Coffeehouse: Captain Planet (Happy birthday!), Oscar, Up'n'Down, and Fry who I did meet a few days ago. Seems like a cool crowd. Maybe will be seeing more of them.Made my way through town doing what I usually do. Used the computer here at the library, picked up my amazing trail drop from No Worries (I walked around town like a king with that package under my arm), got food and so on. I may have done something a little impulsive too...I've missed music quite a bit on the trail and when I spotted a travel guitar at one of the outfitters I couldn't help myself. I bought it. Needless to say, I will be living a little less luxuriously in towns for the next month or so. Now I only need to figure out how it will actually fit in my pack.Spent the rest of the day reading ""The Alchemist"". I didn't think it was a terrible read - it got me to think about some things. Maybe a little overly positive for a cynical stoic like me. As I write this I realize I forgot to do some of my other important tasks like make some warranty claims. May take another zero tomorrow to really rest up and get that all done.In other news, drama is unfolding in the town of Damascus tonight. An ordinance is banning all tenting except for very few special exceptions within the town. Many hostels benefit from being able to sell camping spots, and they seem to be half of the business it town so it's a big deal. There are already lawsuits in motion against it. I'm witnessing some trail history right here!","Damascus, VA
