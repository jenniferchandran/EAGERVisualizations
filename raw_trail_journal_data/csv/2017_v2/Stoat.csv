Stoat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551296,"With a bit more than 3 months before my brother and I hit the trail at Springer Mountain, I am finding it very difficult to keep my feet still. Nearly every free moment is either being spent on a trail, researching equipment, or, reading guide books/journals/history of the trail. After work, I've been doing a fast-hike through a roughly 5.5 mile loop (mostly in the dark) to get my legs up to snuff.I am now referring to my legs as my ""tanks"" (They've become so muscled and defined, I often gaze at them with amazement). Luckily, there are many places not too far away that I can use to train. Also, the AT is only about an hour from my house, so I've put a few miles in there whenever i can. The last month has been a whirlwind of research as well. Finding the best and lightest equipment for the best price, reading scores of reviews, and finally purchasing has been an interesting endeavor. Current gear list: Warbonnet Blackbird Camping Hammock                   Z-Packs Arc Haul Pack                   Enlightened Equipment Revelation 20 Quilt                   Sawyer Squeeze Filtration                   Lighthearted Rain Gear                   Mountain Hardware Base and mid Layers                   MSR Reactor (This, I will swap out for a lighter, smaller stove)                   Black Diamond Storm Headlamp                   Black Diamond Trail Pro Shock Trekking Poles                   2016 Guide Book                   AWOL's 2016 Guide BookAs the time for departure comes nearer, I will update this journal more frequently, and then upload when I can on the trail. I'm not planning on turning my phone on until I get into a town, so it may be that you hear from me every 4-5 days. Can't wait!                  ","
