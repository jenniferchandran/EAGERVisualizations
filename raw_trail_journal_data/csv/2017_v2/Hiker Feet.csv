Hiker Feet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530054,"I intend to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail in one season beginning March 1, 2017. NOBO. If you would have told me I was thinking about doing this this time last year, I'd tell you you were crazy. Hike 2189.1 miles? That's insanity! Now, I am obsessed with it. Every single day of my life, in one way shape or form, I prepare myself for unplugging from the life I have known for 47 years to walk from Georgia to Maine. It's been a journey to get here mentally. In April 2015, I left my hometown in Indiana to follow a dream of becoming a Travel Nurse Practitioner. I love traveling, seeing new places, meeting new people. Traveling for work seemed the perfect fit for my personality. And it is. I started in Eagle Butte, South Dakota working on the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation. I joined a hiking club and began hiking the trails around Rapid City, North Dakota and Wyoming during the weekends. I fell in love with hiking. I began to HATE having to get off the trail as the sun went down. Then, I started thinking I didn't have to, so I started looking into backpacking. The research for lightweight gear began. I spent hours researching lightweight options so I could stay on the trail at night and begin hiking again the next day. Though this sounds cheesy, I have to admit that the movie Wild inspired me. I really had never thought of a thru hike before. Didn't really know what it was. Watching Cheryl Strayed, a woman's, emotional, physical and psychological journey touched me. I cried, which is an unusual thing for me. In an emotional moment, I texted my friend Brandie and told her we should hike the PCT. To my surprise, she was ALL for a thru-hike. She said she had always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. I didn't know much about the AT, but if she would do a thru-hike with me, then maybe I'd think about it. Just maybe. In reality, I thought this dream would fade away. After 4 months in South Dakota, I traveled South to New Mexico for my second assignment. The gear began coming in the mail. Everything was prepared. I really didn't know where to go and was afraid to backpack, so I figured I'd start out small. I started car camping. I found a nice little spot in El Malpais and car camped a few nights. Of course, I loved it. So, my next adventure was my first overnight backpacking trip in the Sandias Mountains in Albuquerque. I have to admit, it wasn't my favorite night ever. I was just a little cold and afraid, but I did it anyway. And I knew I would do it again. Winter came. Winter went. Brandie kept mentioning the AT. I was hesitant at that point. I really didn't think it would happen. What about money and time off work. I have always worked and taking time off seemed impossible. Then I started wondering WHY is it so impossible? I mean, I should live around 80 years or so, what was 6 months of no work in the big scheme of things. The years prior to traveling, I had been downgrading my life. I got sick and tired and bored with things and possessions and wanted to shed what I could from my life. Financially, it could really happen. Slowly over the winter, I began researching the AT. I started to realize maybe it could happen. I started reading books, listening to audiobooks, watching YouTube videos. The more I researched, the more this crazy idea of this long hike became ingrained in my psyche. I started to think that maybe, just maybe it was possible. But, I didn't want to mention it to anybody. What if I didn't really do it? I'd be embarrassed. Then my father died February 5, 2016. My father who had worked his entire life. Who rarely left the little Tavern he owned. He gave his heart and soul to that Tavern and sacrificed so much. He didn't see much of the world. Though, I really don't think he wanted to travel much, anyway. The brevity of life hit me hard. I only have one life. I need to live it the way I want to live it. Few people are as blessed as I am. I have been given much. My health, my mind, my education. I HAVE to give this a try. The research continued and took an upswing. Maybe it is so I don't have to deal with the painful emotions of my fathers death, which I think about often. I miss him and cannot believe this man I have known my whole life is not reachable anymore. What I do know is that it has gotten to the point where this is all I can think about. I research daily. I have spent vast amounts of money at REI. Finally, I started telling people about it as suggested by Zach Davis in his book: Appalachian Trials: The Psychological and Emotional Guide to Successfully Thru-Hiking The Appalachian Trail. I go hiking, camping and backpacking any chance I have. But when I go, it's all to check out my new gear or see how I do on long hikes. It is all about gaining experience for thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2017. So, I have started posting YouTube videos and figured I'd start posting here as a way of keeping a journal for this next big adventure in my short, but blessed life. Hopefully, I'll keep up with it.",,Intentions,"Apr 26, Tue",0
Hiker Feet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531290,"I have been making a lot of progress in my AT preparations. I've got my cold weather gear almost complete. I decided to focus on my cold weather gear in Spring/Summer assuming it will be a good time to catch some sweet deals. And it is. I got an Outdoor Research Balaclava for 12 bucks, a SmartWool midweight shirt for 64 bucks and an REI Revelcloud for $73. All I need now is some Merino Wool mid weight leggings and then I am all set. I plan on focusing on rain gear next. Plus, I have decided to go with a Titanium pot and coffee cup and considering a Zpacks tent and backpack. I contacted the company about a few questions I had. They were responsive. I am sold on the tent, though I don't know if I'll get the SoloPlus or the Duplex. Not as sold on the backpack as it is not women specific. I've gotten some replies on a few hiking/backpacking FB sites from women that have the Zpacks backpacks and they have been overall positive.   The company I work for, CompHealth, gave me a $100 gift card to REI!! I guess for nurses week? My recruiter knows my plans to hike the AT and it meant a lot that they are so supportive. Best company to work for ever!!I haven't been doing much hiking over the past week. I am getting ready to end my assignment here in Gallup in 12 days. Getting ready to go home for a month, so I've been packing. Plus, I have a couple of backpacking trips planned with a the ladies I plan on hiking the AT with next year. I did get out for a quick 6 mile hike today on the Pyramid Trail in Gallup, NM. Funny thing, I got to the summit and a guy that works in the ER where I work was at the top! It was weird to see someone I know up there. We had a nice chat and wound up walking the rest of the trail together. It was a great surprise! I found out that he has done a lot of mountain climbing over his life. I want to climb Mount Wheeler, which is the tallest peak in New Mexico, but kinda afraid to do it by myself. Hopefully, he will be able to climb it with me when I come back. I plan on taking an assignment in Cuba, NM until my CA or WA license comes through. I really want to go somewhere in the Pacific Northwest so I can get some experience backpacking in the rain. Olympic NP is on my radar.",,Progress,"May 03, Tue",0

Hiker Feet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540025,"Things are finally settling down. I got PRK surgery on May 26th. PRK is like Lasik, but the recovery is longer, and damn is it longer! I have been suffering with blurry vision for about 4 weeks. Finally, things are becoming clearer. I haven't done a lot of hiking because of this and it's been frustrating! Plus, I drove from Louisville, KY to Cuba, NM June 12 and started my new assignment on June 15. 1400 miles. It has been a frustrating couple of weeks. My car started running hot and I had a housing nightmare. Things finally settled down on Friday when I moved into my new place and got my car fixed.NOW I can refocus on my AT preparation!!I'm living in Cuba, NM for 1-2 months. It is near the Jemez Mountains. I had no idea that New Mexico had gorgeous mountain ranges just calling for backpackers. Only 20 minutes away lies the beautiful San Pedro Wilderness. I have gone out for 2 day hikes so far and I cannot tell you how spectacular it is. I'm excited to get some mountain backpacking in. Over the past year, I have mainly been hiking in desert-y type landscapes so it is nice for a change of scenery. This weekend, I plan on a 3 night 4 day trip in the San Pedro Wilderness. I scoped out the Las Vacas Trail last weekend. Water is plentiful! The trail is well maintained. I passed other people backpacking, which I love. I love meeting new people and backpackers are always friendly and informative. I just cannot wait to sleep under the stars again!",,Update,"Jun 28, Tue",0
Hiker Feet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553331,"45 days until the AT! I'm in this weird limbo where I don't want to do anything. I'm surrounded by trail in Kent, WA where I am currently residing, but not interested in taking the time to hike. Why? No idea. I suspect it is because I've done so much hiking/backpacking the past year and I see this as a time to reflect. I completed PT on my right hip issue. It is a minor issue and only needed 6 PT visits. I am worried that the minor pain will become more pronounced the more I walk. Turns out, my right hip/IT problem is due to inverting my right leg slightly as I walk. This puts stress on my hip and right leg. Not much I can do about it except strengthen my glute/hamstring/quad. That will certainly come as I hike. I plan on working this out when I step foot on the AT. Maybe not the best idea ever as I have plenty of time to work on it. But, I simply do not want to. No other reason. Therefore, I suspect the first weeks of my hike will be me regretting not putting more effort into strengthening my legs. And to that I think, whatever... lol! Plenty of people begin their AT hike in less shape that they could be. It will mean a slow start and I'm perfectly fine with that. My hiking buddy is recovering from a hip replacement, so I believe we will be equal when the day comes. This is a good thing. Other than that, all my plans and preparations are nearing the end point. I'm ready. I AM READY! I ordered the final things that I will need last night: A charger, pic stick and supplies to make a rain kilt/ground cover. I plan on making a tyvek rain kilt and ground cover. It only cost me 56 bucks, where if I would have bought them separately much more than that. Plus, I'll have something that I made on the trail. I like that idea. I am also working on my support system. This will include a list of why I am hiking this trail and giving it to Lauren and Amy. They will be the ones I will call when my mind is spent and I think about giving up. They are super supportive and know me. I trust and respect them. My goal is that they will be able to talk me through the rough times and strengthen my mind and my spirit when it is low. God, it is so hard to believe only 45 more days!!!!",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Sun",0

Hiker Feet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554386,"Anticipation is KILLING ME!!! Only 2 more days left at work. I am so ready for this assignment to be over. I am 99% ready to go. The only thing I don't have is my poop scoop, bear bag and down booties. I'm having a hell of a time getting my down booties. I ordered them off Goosefeet Gear. The first time, they never arrived and were shipped back to Goosefeet Gear. The second time, I thought I would have them shipped to my house in Indiana. BUT, because I had my mail forwarded, they are forwarding the mail to my WA address. BUT, when the mail gets to Louisville, they ship it back to Clarksville THEN they forward it again! It's been a nightmare. I'm just going to order a new one and have it shipped to my brother. Ugh!!!I was going to go with an Ursack, but then got cold feet. It is heavier than other bear bags. When I put my what's in my gear video on YouTube, I got some responses that made me think it may not be the best option. Ugh! I question EVERYTHING I am planning to take. It's pretty painful! lol! Mom is flying into town on Saturday and then we are driving home to Indiana. I plan on stopping in Salt Lake City to get my car serviced and to check in with the people at CompHealth. I work as a travel nurse practitioner for CompHealth. Though I have been working with them since last April, I still haven't met those guys face-to-face. It will be nice to put a face with a voice.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Thu",0
Hiker Feet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554994,"OMG. In 3 days, my feet will be touching the Appalachian Trail. I cannot believe that it is almost time. I am stoked. I am scared. I am nervous. I have been having trouble sleeping. My brain is in overdrive. Neurons firing constantly to the AT portion of my brain. Should I get this? Should I drop that? I have to go here to get this. I have to go there to ship that. How can I arrange my limited time to see this person? Ugh! I've double booked my time 3 times to meet different people. It's insane. I've made lists and crossing off items. Last night, I packed and repacked. I've set up my tent several times and find it EASY to set up. Hopefully, it will work just fine on the trail. I've lost my tent stakes. I've found my tent stakes. I've had trouble posting videos. I've figured out how to post videos. I need to practice hanging my bear bag. I've bought food. I've packed food. Seems like a lot of food. Is it too much food? Is it too little? Where do I resupply? How do I resupply? Do I have enough warm clothes? Do I have to many warm clothes? Is my pack secure enough against dampness and rain? Oh my poor weary brain. I didn't know I could think about so many different contingencies at the same exact time. Ha!! My brother and sister-in-law are taking me to the AT. I'm so excited and happy that they are taking me. I am sad that Brandie isn't going. But I cannot have it all. Last night, I kept thinking about taking those first steps. I am certain that I will cry my eyes out. I'm so scared. I'm so nervous. I'm so excited. Please hurry up and get here February 25th! Oh, God, how is it almost February 25th? It's too soon!! I'm not ready!! I'm overready. Let's just DO THIS!!!",,3 Days Until The AT.....OMG,"Feb 22, Wed",0
Hiker Feet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555101,Made it to Amicalola Lodge! It's so hard to believe that this time tomorrow I will be sleeping outside under the stars. And hopefully I will have already met some great friends. I'm so grateful. I can't even begin to express how grateful I feel. I had a great drive with my brother and sister-in-law Kirk and Sarah. We got stuck in traffic in Nashville. So we got here about an hour later than expected but that's OK. I'm worn out. Unbelievably tired. I think I will be able to sleep tonight.,,Amicalola!,"Feb 24, Fri",0
