Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577302,"I will soon step onto the Appalachian Trail. It's been 17 years in the making. In the next nine days, I need to finish my taxes (really?), make peace with my first identity theft experience (timing couldn't be better), secure transport details, and sort, weigh, package, and pack food and gear for 14-18 days. I've never done anything quite like this. I'm excited, anxious, nervous and grateful for the life I have that allows me to take this adventure.
In 2000, a friend of mine and I were planning on doing an extended section hike of the AT. A week beforehand my dad's tenuous health issues landed him in the hospital. I drove to Chicago to be with him and cancelled my part of the trip. A map of the AT has been on my wall ever since, reminding me of what never happened and calling me to take a leap of faith. Now, turning 50 is peaking up over the horizon and I've been thinking recently, ""If you're gonna do this, you'd better do it sooner than later."" So I am.
The trip, though I've not yet taken a step, has already stretched me beyond my comfort zone on every level. Its stirring things in my spirit that I'd not anticipated and is training me in ways unimagined. It will unfold in ways beyond my control. I'm deeply in touch with the faith aspect of this journey. I am leaning into Jesus being my guide and teacher because, though I know enough, I really don't know what I'm doing.  
My trail name is Belayed. It comes from a recent conversation with Jesus about the AT, where I had a rock-climbing image flash across my mind's eye, and then he said: 
""You don't have anyone belaying you, but I'm going to belay you. This is part of why you need to do the trip alone. Because you really need to experience Me belaying you."" 
I'm holding onto this promise from the core of my being. This is my Trust Walk. 
He also said:
""You need Me. 
I will carry you. 
I will protect you. 
I will guide you. 
I will provide for you.""  
And so, I will trust my guide, teacher, and belayer.
Thanks for reading along and joining me in this adventure. I will talk about Jesus a lot—fair warning—and I hope that doesn't turn any of you away. I may also include a few prayer requests...I'm pretty sure I'll need that, too! More to come...",,View Entry,"Sep 08, Fri",0
Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577823,"Woke up to a mountain valley covered in fog. Windmills in the distance looked like they were floating. Overwhelming beauty. Spent last night at an Airbnb in MD, where I was generously cared for by my hosts (thanks, Heidi & Dale!). I entered Virginia on a small country highway. The first sign I saw said Smokin' Musket Outdoors. Wish I'd had a few minutes to check it out. That's not something ya see in Evanston!  
I dropped off my three food boxes at Luray, Elkton, and Waynesboro. (Next time I'll mail them.) Ended at Rockfish Gap at the southern most point of Shenandoah National Park (SNP) and waited for transport north to Front Royal. Picked a name off a list of people who are available to shuttle hikers to and fro. That's how I met Pam Bennett. She drove me to my first hostel, Mountain Home Cabbin, just off the AT. We talked about hiking, adventuring, and things that sometimes get in the way of realizing our dreams. 
Earlier in the morning I connected to the fact that my adventurous spirit is indeed an inheritance from my dad. My mom's idea of adventure was sitting next to the lodge fireplace doing a watercolor while the rest of us skied. Certainly enjoyable but not risky at all. My AT trip is intimately connected to my dad. He died five months after canceling my 2000 AT trip. He was excited for me back then. He would be today. So, I dedicate this next (and first) 100 miles to Herbert Bond Ray, who gave me his adventurous spirit, his impatience with bad drivers, and a little bit of his uncanny ability to ""figure it out."" I love you, dad, and miss you.",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Sat",0
Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578104,"Days One & Two have been wonderful. It's been quite humid at times, especially when literally hiking in the clouds! Breezes have come just when needed and it's cooled down in the evenings. Acorns are constantly falling, which is a little unnerving in the middle of the night as it sounds like footsteps! Thank God for earplugs :) There are beautiful vistas at times and sometimes socked in by clouds. It truly is the ""green tunnel"" where sunscreen's not required and you better like the woods.
Day One: Compton Gap to Gravel Springs Hut (7.7 miles)Day Two: GSH to an undesignated campsite on Ridge south of Elkwallow Wayside (7.7ish miles)I've been blessed with a very enjoyable hiking companion, John, aka: Yoda. We met at Mountain Home Cabbin. In some ways he reminds me of my dad, and it's been a privilege learning tips from one with many life experiences and wisdom. Our conversations ebb and flow, we appreciate a similar pace (he likes that I help him slow down and enjoy it more), and there's comfortable silences. Day Three will be our last day hiking together as he'll be joining a friend while I linger a little longer at this point. I will certainly miss him and I'm also very ready to walk solo with Jesus.","Compton Gap

Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578112,"Sometimes the distance between huts/designated campsites is a little farther than this hiker can handle. Finding an un-designated spot to camp involves a little perseverance and faith. According to some well-researched trail notes, on my Day Two, there was to be a ""level area to camp...following the contour of the mountain northeast from the marked spring cement post near the Jeremy's Run Trail intersection."" Catch all that? Yeah, me neither. As John and I hiked here, we saw only extremely overgrown not-so-level terrain. He suggested we continue on for another mile or so including 600 direct vertical feet (no switchbacks) and trust that there'd be open areas on the ridge line above. Trust. After two days, I definitely had a fair amount of trust in John's backpacking and outdoors experience. Then again, I knew he knew absolutely squat about what lay ahead on that ridge line! In the next moments, I chose to trust that Jesus knew the trail and what lay ahead and would prepare a place for us. As we snail paced up the ascent, I intentionally let John off the hook for any responsibility of what came next and mentally prepared myself to bunk on the side of the trail if need be.
We breathed heavily. Leaned increasingly on our poles and sweat a lot. I second guessed my decision to have the famous Elkwallow blackberry shake AND the Club Combo as an early dinner. We finally came to the ridge and kept walking and walking, scanning both sides of the trail silently, just trusting something would have to open up. And it did. There it was. A spacious, open, well-enough free of roots & rocks area for several tents. We laughed freely as we let out our inner anxious feelings and shared our unspoken fears. I could see the relief on John's face. He did feel responsible. I'm glad Jesus came through for him, too. 
We settled into our level areas for the night and celebrated with some white wine John schlepped up from the wayside below. Two through-hikers joined us just as it was getting dark. We were happy to share space with the scrawny recent college grads on a trip of a lifetime before getting real jobs. They were up before the sunrise, starting another 20+ mile day. 
There will be more undesignated camping areas coming up. I trust that Jesus goes ahead to prepare a place for me. ","Gravel Springs Hut

Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578142,"After my last day hike with John, we parted and I went to relax, nap, read and clean up at Pass Mountain Hut. It was a beautiful sunny breezy afternoon spent laying in the tent watching and listening to the leaves and acorns fall. Several other through-hikers arrived late in the afternoon. Heard coyotes, frogs and owls during the evening and early morning hours. I was the last to leave camp this morning for an easy 1.5 mile hike to US-211. I sang and laughed and enjoyed my first morning on my own. Open Arms hostel shuttled me to a shower, laundry and a relaxing day off trail. Enjoyed helping my host, Alison, hang a ceiling fan in her home. Appreciated not hiking on a sunny 80 degree day. Carb loaded at dinner for the steep ascent to Mary's Rock and The Pinnacle awaiting me in AM.","Pass Mountain Hut

Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578510,"Alison shuttled me back to US-211/Thornton Gap parking lot where I started back on the trail. The highlight of the day was the expansive view of the entire area from Mary's Rock at 3,515 ft. I had the summit all to myself. It was exhilarating and overwhelmingly joyful. Deeply satisfying after a 1.9 mi, 1,200 ft climb. I lingered a while, dried out feet and footwear, inhaled pb crackers with nutella, and soaked in the sunny view. Spectacular. Perhaps the most beautiful view in SNP. 
I continued on for 5.2 miles to find a lovely and level campsite for the evening...prepared just for me. Just off the AT, a few yards down Crusher Ridge Trail, elevation 3,181 ft. Rainbow and Diablo joined me past 6pm, as most thru hikers do. Enjoyed meeting them. There's been a lot of ascending and descending today. My feet and back are feeling it. Spent a while massaging all parts. Satisfying.","Thornton Gap

Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578749,"Felt like a really long day, though only 7.1 miles. Perhaps skipping my oatmeal breakfast was a bad idea. Maybe it's just the cumulative effect of Day 6. Regardless, I'm doubling up oatmeal in AM! Had my first equipment malfunction today right when I really needed it. Yesterday I'd planned to get extra water at a picnic area to carry ahead because of the lack of sources for the next day. Once I got to the picnic area there were gnat swarms everywhere which completely threw me off, so I bolted faster than planned and forgot to over supply on water. Once I made dinner I realized I was down to a liter. Hence, skipping oatmeal and rationing my water intake all morning. After a long ascent to the top of Little Stony Man, I was shocked when my eye was caught by a small pool clear of water among the rocks. Totally unexpected! No mention of this in any of the notes I've read. There were even tiny tadpoles swimming around. :) I eagerly drank the rest of the water I had and squatted down to refill with my water filter. About 3/4 of the way to filling the bottle, the filter started being sluggish. Eventually not pumping out much at all. Ugh. Couldn't figure out what was wrong, tried troubleshooting up there but the wind was really picking up (so was my skirt!) and I didn't want to lose any of the filter pieces. Packed up and moved on, hoping for resolution. 
Finally made it to Skyland Restaurant where I took over the Women's Restroom for clinic time with my filter and a little discrete laundry opp. Still not working. Called the company's toll free line and was helped by a nice man who reassured me I wouldn't break it :). Worked on it some more, then just called it a day. It was either gonna work on the trail or not, but I needed to keep going. I was feeling ""behind"" which is funny to write now, but that's how it feels when you're hiking a specific amount and your body starts hurting by 2pm. So I headed out, trusting that it would work or someone would let me borrow theirs or God would make purified water come out from a rock. After all, my destination was Rock Spring Hut. Legs started hurting even earlier today--oatmeal effect? I was hiking quite slowly on the descent to the hut. Water filter worked. It really is a spring coming out of a huge pile of lichen covered rocks. 
The Hut area is the most crowded I've seen. Weekend hikers but also lots of thru hikers. Fun to hear about their adventures. Picnic table talk revolves around food and gear. Gave away some of my Chana Masala dinner (because I was full, not out of pity) to an 18-year old with a bottomless stomach. He's lost 35+ pounds since starting in May. The rest of it went to Ryan, a 22-year old from Connecticut who's doing the same hike I am but going Northbound instead. There's a special kind of camaraderie around hiking the AT, even if you're just doing a section. Most of them will probably be long gone by the time I'm having my double portion of oatmeal.","Crusher Ridge Trail

Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578750,"This was my longest day hiking...and it feels like it! I hadn't planned it out like this in advance but it made sense once things unfolded. Started off with a 1,200 ft ascent up Hightop Mountain. Quite the warm up. Another spectacular view of the Shenandoah valley. 
Was holding up pretty well until around noon when my ankle started bothering me again on the descents and level trail. Increasingly painful. Took a third break on the side of Skyline Drive at the base of the final mountain of the day. A hiker came along and mentioned that there was little to no water at Pinefield Hut (my destination). I had less than a litre in my pack and 2/3 of one water bottle full. Not enough for the hike plus dinner plus breakfast and general hydration. Hoping for a Good Samaritan, I waved down the next car that drove by. They filled up my empty bottle with two gatorades. Yes! Then I thought, ""Why not do it again to top off my water?"" Waved down car #2 and the woman had just refilled her water bottle and was more than willing to share. Yes again! Ask and ye shall receive. 
Climbed third and final mountain. Sweating profusely. Ankle getting worse on descent. Unsure what to do. Asked Jesus for help. ""Try hiking backwards on the downhills."" It worked! No pain. When the trail was too rocky, I couldn't go backwards, so I went really slowly. Two hours later (normally, an hour) I hobbled into the hut area. Empty. Found a site and set up my tent. Half hour later a young woman named Silly Spilly joined me. She's a through hiker who's doing it in a patchwork/flip floppy sort of a way. We had a fabulous evening together. She helped me hang my pack and food bag on the bear pole, which I'd never done. This was the first Hut without a Bear Box instead. Hoping for no mice or bears tonight!
Wildlife sitings: Mr. Snail early on the trail and Mr. Very Large Toad near the hut at dinner. 
Gear Issues: Very small tear in my sleeping pad causing leakage. Took me a long time to find it because it was so tiny. Don't have 24 hours to wait for the ""official"" patch job to dry. Duct tape. 
Vandalism: a mouse/mice chewed multiple holes in the bug netting of my tent, took several bites out of the bottom of my down bag and added many holes to my favorite bandana. Dang it! What IS it with mice chewing my stuff??! Duct tape & my 2000 AT sewing kit from big brother Charly. ","Swift Run Gap
",Pinefield Hut,"Sep 26, Tue",11.60
Belayed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578751,"What I thought would feel like a ""rest day"" actually wasn't. Starting out, I took it easy after a sunrise goodbye to Silly Spilly. Got out of camp at 10AM. Nice not to rush after the long day yesterday, but what I hadn't considered was the temperature. Much warmer today, so getting in several hours in the cool of the day would have been good. Also it was the first day that the green tunnel disappeared and gave way to a lot of exposed mountainside hiking. Didn't see that coming...and was running low on water for first several hours. Neglected dropping an electrolyte tab into my bottle once I did refill. Took a premature turn late in the day and had to backtrack costing me a valuable half mile. All this plus the usual ascent/descend pattern of the AT left me vulnerable. Fatigue set in, my calves started feeling funny, and the wayside meal I was aiming for felt miles away. 
As I started eating my grilled ham & cheese with tomato and salt & vinegar chips, I knew I wasn't okay. I was dazed, moving very slowly and all I wanted was to put my head down and sob. Not good. The campground was still a significant walk away. I knew I couldn't do it. I was too dehydrated and my body wasn't recovering any time soon. Someone finally had mercy on me after being turned down by several folks for a ride up the road to the campground. Grateful for the ride. I couldn't have made it in my condition. 
With my pack back on and my feet going numb, I set out to pick a site and collapse into my tent. Found one but had a few logistical questions so I awkwardly said hello into the window of a vintage camper nearby. Next thing I knew, this incredibly hospitable couple bent over backwards to help me out. They invited me to free camp on their site, offered to drive me down to the showers, and join them for a grilled salmon dinner. Wow. In my dehydrated and needy state I wasn't about to turn down any of their generosity. It's difficult to express my gratitude for this experience. As hard as the day has been, I'm so glad it led me to meet them. Tomorrow I take a zero day. My body needs it.","Pinefield Hut
