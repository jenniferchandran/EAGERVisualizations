Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554160,"The temperature was around 32 at 6:30 this morning at Oak Mountain and seemed like a great day for a long hike. I have been getting my pack ready for my AT adventure beginning in April and hiking with it for the past couple of months to get my old bones familiar with a heavy load. I have been hiking with anywhere from 32 to 34 pounds and can easily hike 6 to 10 miles before stopping to take a breather. Hiking in the cooler weather helps a lot since hiking in 70 degree temperatures causes a lot of sweat to develop and drains my energy. I hiked the 6.7 miles on the blue trail and saw no one. The trail was basically dry and Peavine Falls was flowing with a lot of water again after the recent rains. The blue trail is pretty tame once one makes the ascent to the top of the ridge which is a little over 1000 feet.   I took a rest after about 5 miles to take in some calories and drink some water. It was a little cool while eating my snack since I had worked up a sweat and there was a cool breeze blowing. I finished the blue trail at the South Trail Head and started hiking the white trail back to the North Trail Head which is about 6.3 miles. The hike takes me over the highest point at Oak Moutain which is the Shackleford Ridge at almost 1300 feet. Great views during the winter when the leaves have dropped from the trees. I just love it up high where you can view this beautiful planet, it is just great to have this opportunity to experience such views. After finishing the white trail I took off on the yellow trail from the North Trail Head and hiked 2-3/4 miles around Serenity Lake. The Lake was filled from the recent rains and the water was flowing abundantly over the dam. A great place to stop for a snack is right below the dam and being able to see and hear the water rushing down to the stream below. This beats any restaurant that I have ever visited. Hiked the 2-3/4 miles back to the North Trail Head finishing my hike for the day. I felt that I could have hiked more but figured there are a number of days before I begin hiking the AT again so I headed home for a nice afternoon meal with my wonderful wife. Enjoy theis beautiful planet.",,"Oak Mountain State Park, Birmingham, AL","Feb 03, Fri",18.50
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554169,"My pack is ready after going through it a number of times. The weight with 2L of water and about 7 lbs of food is around 33 pounds. I have been hiking with this amount of weight over the past couple of months and it feels about right. Of course the weight will vary, up and down, while hiking due to the usage of food as I hike and resupply. I have toyed with the idea of using my hammock to begin in April but I feel it will be too cold and I do not want to carry the extra weight of an under quilt. I plan to use my Big Agnis 2 man tent. It is light weight and easy to put up. My sleeping bag is rated at 15F so I should stay warm enough and if necessary I will wear my puff jacket at night. Enjoy this beautiful planet.",,AT,"Feb 04, Sat",0
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554170,"I plan to hike tomorrow, 02/06/17, at Oak Mountain State Park. The weather looks cool in the morning, so I will probably do just 12 miles. We are getting a good rain today so the streams should be full of water. The sound of the water is like music while hiking the trails. Enjoy this beautiful planet.",,Oak Mountain State Park,"Feb 05, Sun",0
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554823,Hiked at Oak Mountain today. Left out on the Yellow Trail and and connected with the White Trail at Maggie's Glen and hiked up to Shackleford Ridge which is the highest point on the trail at 1250+ feet. I hiked to the end of the trail and returned to Peevine Falls on the Blue Trail. The water was rushing over the Falls after the recent rains. Many of the streams that were dry have water flowing in them now which is good to see. Many of the small trees that were harmed in the drought last year appear to be under distress and will probably not make it. I noticed where a troop of Boy Scounts planted some trees at different places at Oak Mountain. It good to see that we have young men that really care about our planet and are helping to take care of it.I plan to hike again on Sunday since it will be a while before I can hike again. I am having a cataract taken off my left eye and will be unable to pick much weight up ore do extensive exercise until it heals (probably a couple of weeks). Total miles hiked today - 13.,,"Yellow Trail, White Trail and Blue Trail","Feb 16, Thu",0
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554831,"Hiked out on the Blue Trail past Peevine Falls to the South Trailhead and then back to the North Trailhead on the White Trail. Met quite a number of folks on the trails today. The weather is just beautiful and the flowers are coming up. It will not be long before the forest will be green again and winter will only be a memory. The temperature was around 38 when I started out around 6:30 AM and by the time I finished hiking it was around 70 degrees. Needless to say the sweat appeared during those uphill treks. I am carrying a 34 pound pack that adds to the fun while I am hiking so I knew that the sweat would happen. At any rate, any time I am out on any trail it is not boring and my mind is at peace. I am thankful that I have a place like Oak Mountain to hike.When I left Oak Mountain the parking lots were filling up and the entrance was backed up for several hundred yards. There were hikers, bikers, and folks that just wanted to go sit by the lake. Just a beautiful day.",,Oak Mountain,"Feb 19, Sun",0
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557753,"Well, this is the last week that I'll be home before I get back on the trail on April 2. I feel that my pack is ready for a long walk to Maine. The weather looks good for Sunday and I'm hoping the rain holds off until I can get at least one day of hiking accomplished before it begins. As I mentioned before, Mustardseed, my daughter, and I began the trail at Springer Mountain last year and got off in Erwin Tennessee. Last November, I hiked from Erwin to Damascus with a friend Steve Manley. This will be more of a section hike (a long section hike) and not a thru hike but it is my hike. I appreciate my wife for supporting me in this endeavor since the responsibility of our home is on her shoulders. Also, I will always be thankful that my daughter, Mustardseed, got me interested in hiking and camping. I just enjoy being the woods surrounded by nature and all it has to offer. A hot cup of coffee by a babbling stream beats Starbucks anyday.Until Damascus.","Springer Mountain

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558961,"I wanted to start this journal earlier about my hike but due to no service for either Verizon nor AT&T I am putting the last 4 days into this one journal entry. I have hiked 63.2 miles since Damascus.Beginning another hike trying to get to Maine and stayed at the Lazy Fox B&B last night in Damascus. My daughter and her husband Bill drove me to Damascus and also stayed at the Lazy Fox. We had dinner at Bobo's and then watched some of the basketball playoffs. The next morning we had a great breakfast that Miss Ginny made for us. If you're ever in Damascus make sure you go and stay at the Lazy Fox and enjoy that great breakfast.My daughter Michelle got me off on April 2nd from Damascus and she was able to walk with me the first mile to get me on the trail. I will certainly miss Mustard Seed very much on my hike but I know her thoughts are with me (my daughter and I hiked from Springer to Erwin last year). I will also miss my lovely wife who is taking care of the home front while I'm hiking.The first day on the trail I met Breeze, a southbound hiker from Maine headed to Springer. She was looking for somewhere to have dinner. I told her that we ate at Bobo's for dinner the night before in Damascus and she said she would look it up when she got there. It was a good day for hiking in the mountains and I was able to walk 15.8 miles to the Lost Mountain shelter. At Lost Mountain I met several thru-hikers going northbound like Skydive and Walden. I was the first one to get to the shelter so that is where I stayed and it was a pretty good night's sleep. I got up early the next morning heading out for Wise shelter.The hike to Wise shelter was going to be along one. We also knew that there was a storm brewing and that we might not be able to make it and wouldbhave to stop off at Thomas knob shelter. About halfway up Mount Rogers, Virginia's highest peak at 5729 feet, the bottom dropped out of the sky. The wind was blowing fiercely and the rain was coming down sideways. When you're climbing a mountain where you start off around 3,300 feet and your going to the height of 5430 feet and the rain is blowing everywhere and the wind is blowing your Poncho around it is tough hiking.I wanted to stop at Buzzard Rock which was at 5080 feet but was unable to. The wind was blowing so hard on the ball up there about Buzzard Rock that I could barely stand up. There was a group of people that hiked up from a blue-blaze trail and wanted to see the rock but it was just too windy for them to go up there.At any rate, I made it to Thomas knob shelter. Which is at the 497.3 mile mark so I was able to get 12.3 miles and during that miserable weather.A group of Boy Scouts came in about 45 minutes after I got to the shelter and they were all drenched. Also later on there were several section hikers and thru-hikers that came in to the shelter and we had to make room for all the people to get in. No one was going anywhere for the rest of the day because the wind kept blowing in the rain kept coming down in sheets and we were concerned about the stability of the shelter. Everyone got in the shelter and were able to get dry clothes on to prevent hypothermia. It was a noisy night with all the people in there so the amount of sleep I got was very little. It was good seeing the young men and women that were working on their Eagle badge and they were real nice kids and their parents were super. I have a Therm-a-Rest mattress which is inflatable and pretty comfortable compared to those foam pads. During the night a sixteen-year-old scout slept next to me on his pad and he kept trying to get on my inflated mattress all night. Trying to push a big kid who is sound asleep off your mattress is tough. But we made it through the night and I got up early the next morning heading out for Hurricane shelter.I wanted to get somewhere where I could dry my clothes out from the day before so I stopped at WISE shelter to do that. The sun came out and it was just a beautiful day other than being quite windy. I hung my clothes out on the trees and stayed there for about 45 minutes while I ate brunch and looked around to see if I could see any of the wild horses since I was so close to Grayson Highlands. The clothes mostly got dry so I packed up and headed out to see the horses at Grayson Highlands. It was real windy up in the highlands but I was able to run across several horses and I've attached a picture of one of them that just walked up to me and wanted something to eat. The Rangers up there ask visitors not to feed the horses but I bet you 90% of the people carry carrots or apples up there to feed them. I have attached a picture of one of the little ponies that came up to me looking for something to eat. After getting pictures of ponies I headed out for Hurricane Mountain shelter. I did stop by Old Orchard shelter and there was a hiker there by the name of Now or Never and about the same age as me. We talked for a few minutes and then I left. He mentiond that he was headed to the same shelter that I was and that he would see me later on. He did come in to the shelter a little later and said he rolled his foot on one of the many rocks coming down the mountain to Hurricane shelter.Hurricane shelters located at 513.4 mile marker and when I got there no one was there. Later on Ant-Man and Dakota showed up and in a little while later Now or Never showed up. Two other hikers showed up a little later so we had the group for the night. It was a warm night and very uneventful other than two hikers that snored loudly that kept us awake part of the night.I left Hurricane shelter heading for Partnership shelter, which was about 18 .8 miles away. The day was very blustery and there was a projection that we would have a thunderstorm early afternoon. Going through the many trees on top of the mountains that I was hiking was a little scary in the sense that limbs kept falling out of trees while the wind blew across the crest of the mountains. I guess in this situation you just put your head down, look at the trail and keep walking because if a limb falls on you and kills you it's just your time to go. I stopped at some roadside at one of the gaps and made brunch. The wind was still blowing even at the lower elevations and I was sitting there getting my utensils washed up down a hill by a stream and the wind picked up heavily. As a result my chair blew off and was headed for the creek. The water in the creek was moving swiftly and if my chair got in the creek I would never see it again. I had to go down this embankment in a briar patch and retrieve my chair because I don't know what I would do without my little hiking chair. I'm thankful that the briar patch caught the chair before it got in the creek. It is an Alite Monarch chair that is worth its weight in gold. A lot of people wonder why I'm carrying a chair but when I get to camp and I am able to sit down with my back supported by this little chair it is so comfortable. I wouldn't lose that chair for anything.I made it to Partnership shelter and called Jim Sparks to pick me up. Jim's telephone number for his cell phone is 276 - 378 - 4781. He said to share this number with other thru-hikers because he wants to help out any way he can. Jim Sparks is a great guy that helps hikers out! He picked me up and drove me into Marion and I'm staying in a hotel here tonight. I plan to pick up another rain suit since my other one blew apart and is useless. We're supposed to have rain almost all day today and snow tonight in the mountains. I don't know how far I'm going to hike today or if I'm going to hike at all. I'll look at the weather forecast and if I can get out I will at least try to make it to Atkins which is a little over 12 miles. Until next time!","Damascus

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559007,"Partnership Shelter to Atkins, VAHiked 11.6 miles today for a total of 544 miles. This was a short day because we are expecting anywhere from 1 to 6 inches of snow tonight and I certainly didn't want to be on the trail during that type of weather. We will see in the morning what happens and if there's not more than a couple inches of snow I'm heading out.Last night I had dinner at a good Mexican restaurant near the hotel. This morning I got up after the rain that we had during the night and went to McDonald's and ate two egg and cheese biscuits, boy were they delicious. Also, the coffee has improved greatly since the last time I had coffee at McDonald's so I'll try to again someday. I then walked across the street to Walmart and picked up a rainsuit since my poncho got devastated by the wind.I got my pack repacked and I called Jim Sparks to come pick me up to take me back to Partnership Shelter to continue my hike on the trail.Jim Sparks, The driver that picked me up at the shelter, is one of the nicest individuals I believe I've ever met. Jim was a coalminer and has black lung and it forced him to retire. He picks up hikers and will not take any money for the trips he makes. He makes almost hundreds of trips a year and never charges anyone anything. As a matter fact he has a camper in his backyard where two hikers that are low on money are sleeping until the weather gets better. These ""mountain folks"" are some of the best people that I've ever been associated with. They really care about their fellow man and it shows in what they do for people. Just to give you another example, Jim told me about the Settlers Museum on the hike to Adkins. I visited the museum and saw how the Germans moved southward into southern Virginia and northern North Carolina and Tennessee and settled the area. They do not charge thru hikers but you can make a donation. Next door to the museum is an old-school house where they have hiker food and also other items that hikers might need at no cost, you can make a donation.Getting back to Jim Sparks. Jim shared with me that in the Town of Marion he counted 76 deer on a plot but you can't shoot deer inside the city limits. Also he shared with me that there were 47 turkeys on another plot that's also within the city limits and you can't shoot them either. My son-in-law would love this place with all the wild game that's out here since he enjoys hurting very much. As I was hiking today I saw two deer, two ducks, and two turkeys. The turkeys were on the side of the road going up to the shelter, the deer were on the trail and the ducks were on the trail.The weather was windy on the trail today and there were limbs falling again. It rained about halfway on the 12 mile hike but I made it to the hotel that I'm staying in located in Atkins. I hope the weather clears up so that I can just spend seven days on the trail in my tent or in a shelter which is a lot better than sitting in a hotel room. I guess one of the best things about my current situation is that I'm looking at the Masters golf tournament right now and so it makes life OK.I ate at another Mexican restaurant today when I got into Atkins and it was just as good as the Mexican restaurant last night. I've got to start walking more miles or I'm going to gain some weight out here on the trail which is unbelievable.There are several other hikers here at the hotel that have been here for a couple of days and they told me about the Barn Restaurant up the road that has a great breakfast. I plan to go up there around 7 o'clock when they open in the morning and eat all I can before I head out (if the snow is not too deep).This is such a beautiful planet and I am able to see some of the best that the planet has to offer out here (both people and nature) where nothing disturbs it but the trail. I am so lucky. Until later.","Parternship Shelter

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559476,"Adkins Virginia to Bland Virginia total miles 46.1Adkins to Lick Creek campsite 18.4 miles.From Adkins to Lick Creek I crossed the quarter way point on the way to Maine. It was rocky and snowy while hiking early in the day. I sought shelter for about 30 minutes until the heavy snow stopped. I started hiking again hoping to make it to the next shelter without any issues. I made it to Lick Creek, a camping site which was 18.4 miles for the day. I put my tent up under a beautiful rhododendron garden by a large stream. It was certainly nice going to sleep listening to the water flowing. I also ran across Huggs and Trinity while there and they also camped there that night. I got up early the next morning heading out to Jenkins shelter.Lick Creek to Jenkins shelter 16.4 miles.It was a cold morning when I got up at Lick Creek but I started out with hopes to have an easy day. That was not the result for that day. First of all there was snow melting in the lower elevations which made the trail very slippery. In the higher elevations the snow was deeper and if you're going downhill the slopes were very slippery. For instance up on Chestnut Knob where the shelter is located, it is a beautiful site looking down in the valley, but it is deceiving because snow awaits. I took this Beautiful sight in and then started almost a vertical downhill. This downhill faces the north and the snow was about 4 inches deep in the trail. Going straight down hill trying to keep from busting your bottom is tough when it goes down for 1.5 miles. The trail today was also tough because there are many ups and downs along the ridges and rocks all over the path which made hiking tough. Hiking shoes will not last very long going over rocks like I did on this particular part of the trail.Jenkins shelter to Bland Virginia for a total of 11.3 milesI continue to meet new hikers at shelters this includes Sleuth, Doc, and also I saw Antman. Meeting different people on the trail helps you understand what's ahead on the trail and it also is very entertaining since there's little other communication tools available. The hike today was very uneventful. It was a very easy hike to Bland compared to what I've been through the last week or so. I was picked up at the trailhead by Bubba who runs a shuttling service. He is a very nice gentleman that got me into Bland. I needed supplies so I went to Dollar General to pick them up. The people there were very nice and helped me get my supplies together. I then went to the Dairy Queen and had a chicken sandwich, fries and a Dr Pepper. I usually drink diet Dr Pepper but under these circumstances I think I can eat anything with sugar in it and it would not amount to much. Also, I need all the calories that I can get to sustain energy under trail conditions.I plan to be dropped off tomorrow and make it to Helveys Mill shelter and meet up with the group I was hiking with. This includes Sleuth Huggs and Trinity.Later.","Adkins, VA

Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559816,"Bland to Pearisburg, VAIn Bland Virginia I went to the Dairy Queen and had two chicken sandwiches, they were yummy. I picked up some supplies at Dollar General. I stayed in Bland overnight and was picked up the next morning by Bubba's Shuttles. Bubba took me to the AT trailhead the next morning. I had planned to go to the shelter where my hiking friends were but the shelter was 3/10 of a mile off the trail so I decided to go on. I hiked all day and made it to Dismal Falls. When I got to the Falls Doc and Ace were already there so I set up my tent by them and we got a fire going. We all decided to jump in a deep part and take a good bath which we all did. We also washed her clothes. We set around the campfire and told stories that night about our hiking adventures. I met two hikers I had not met before, Dax and Brown Bear. The rest of the crew came in a little later that included Hugs, Trinity, Sleuth, Moses and Ant-man. I did get over to Trent's Grocery and got me a pecan cluster ice cream bar and a peach tea. Boy were they good. The hike today was 20.2 miles.Dismal Falls to Pearisburg I decided to make a long hike today all the way to Perrysburg. Doc in Ace got off at Woods Hole Hostel to see their beekeeping activities, so I had to hike the rest of the 10 miles alone. It was 25.1 miles and boy was I tired at the end of the day. The sun was bright most of the day sweat was flowing profusely down my body. I did make it after about 13 hours of hiking. Of course this included a few stops to eat and rest a bit. I decided to stay in Pearisburg to get some supplies at Walmart. Also I went to a Chinese all-you-can-eat buffet here in Pearisburg and it was really good. The Chinese lady waiting on me though kept telling me to eat slow, eat slow. As anyone can tell you who has hiked a lot, when you see a lot of food you just can't get enough. I plan to do only a short hike today, maybe nine or 10 miles up the mountain and stay in a shelter there.Later","Bland, VA

The folks at the Hostel told me it was just down the street. 2.7 miles later I ended up at Walmart. That was 5.4 miles just to get back to where I started at the hostel. I did have breakfast at Hardee's and it was good. I hiked down to Pearisburg cemetery where I got off the trail the day before which was 1.6 miles. While I was hiking I met up with Downhill whom I had hiked with before. We met each other at the top of the mountain at a shelter and decided to move on. Since I had a big day yesterday I went to the next camping spot (643.7 mile marker) and put up my tent. Downhill said that he was going to the next shelter which was about 12 miles away and I figured that was too far for me to walk before dark. I met another gentleman here, Spanky, who is from Michigan. We sat around and talked for A number of hours and cooked our dinner and got ready for bed. At about the time we were finishing Doubleknot showed up southbound. Somewhere along the line I lost my bear line. Spanky was nice enough to give me part of his to use until I can get some more. Thank goodness for people on the trail they are so nice.Campsite to Bailey Gap Shelter 14.9 milesCruise Control, Outsider, and Spanky all at Bailey Gap shelter. A section hiker fell and cut a gash below his left eye. I ask the folks with him if they had a first aid kit and said yes. I ask if there was anything I could do and they said no. I hiked on. Stopped at Captain's (see photo) and rode the zipline/trolley across the river. He provides wifi, soda, charging station and camping at no cost. I ask him if he took donations and he said ""pass it down the trail to a hiker that needs it."" Great and wonderful people still exist. A long hot trip up the mountain to the shelter. We put a fire together led be Cruise Control. He is a really nice young man. Took a bath in the stream near the shelter, cold but certainly refreshing in the hot air. Mountain water tasks great! When I was in Pearisburg I could hardly drink the chlorinated water it tasted so bad. Plan to hike to Laurel Creek Shelter tomorrow which is 14.6 miles.Bailey Gap Shelter to Laurel Creek Shelter. 14.6 milesI had my first ""major"" trail magic today, I was hiking over Wind Rock and there it was, a big display of trail magic. The provider hiked the AT last year and is ""giving back."" I had a banana, tangerine, and several granola bars. This is very much appreciated by all hikers. While hiking a turkey flew out of a tree and scared the dickens out of me. A lot of wild life exists on the trail.Laurel Creek Shelter to Pickle Branch Shelter 22.5 milesWhile hiking today I had some trail magic at the Audie Murphy Monument. He died in a plane crash at this site on May 28, 1971. I decided to make it a long day of hiking since I wanted to have a short hike tomorrow. Saw the second largest oak on the AT 18 feet in circumference. It is the Keefer Oak and is over 300 years old.Pickle Branch Shelter to Four Pines Hostile 6.7 miles Got up early to make this difficult hike both up and down the mountain to ""Dragon's Tooth."" The terrain was boulders of rock and was more rock climbing than hiking. Pines Hostile owner, Joe, only takes donations from hikers. He has a van to take you to the store and a wonderful restaurant, Homeplace Restaurant! I had fried chicken, pinto beans, slaw, mashed potatoes, cooked apples, biscuits, and peach pie with vanilla ice cream. I was about to pop when we left.","Pearisburg, VA

The mayor came by and welcomed us to the city. He shared a bit of history and provided the rules. No alcohol or pot to be used in the park where we camped. He did mention that several trains would pass during the night since the park is located by the tracks. I never heard anything until the next morning. Walked the 1.2 miles back to the trail, heading for Bobblets Gap Shelter. Most of the day sprinkling rain kept things cool. The fog was pretty heavy so there was little to see from the Blue Ridge Parkway which I crossed several times. Got to the Shelter and only one hiker was there, Smiles. He is from Bath, UK and is hiking down to Atlanta. He started hiking at Glasgow, VA. He had a 45 lb pack with all of his camping and travel clothes. I hope he makes it.Bobblets Gap Shelter to Bryant Ridge Shelter. 13.5 milesSmiles cooking system broke so I cooked last nights meal for him. I told him I wanted to get started early so he would have to get up with me if he wanted me to cook his oatmeal. I had to wake him up and he had hot oatmeal. I wished him luck and took off, about an hour later than planned. Hiked in the mist to begin the day and still had no good views from the Blue Ridge Pkwy. Got to Bryant Ridge Shelter and Purge was there. A thunderstorm was developing so we both wanted to see what developed. After about 45 minutes Purge left. Wildebeest showed up around 9:30 PM. He almost missed the shelter because there's no sign that lets you know there is a shelter and he was walking with a headlamp. He cooked his meal and as he cooked we had a long conversation about the business's we were in. He is a nice man from Pennsylvania and it was good to meet him. My wife has been following him on Trail Journals for some time and I was able to get A photo of him and send to her.Bryant Ridge Shelter to Matts Creek Shelter. 22.6 milesI started out the morning planning on walking 15 miles but I felt so good I figured that I could go further and ended up walking around 22 miles. During my hike today I was going across the road beginning to go up a mountain and there was trail magic. The lady handing out trail magic had a banana and some pistachios for me. People have been so nice on the trail to hikers and that's good to see. All up through the Appalachians the people have been friendly and willing to help you out if you need it.I did go through the Guillotine today, this is two rocks holding up a huge boulder above your head and you have to walk under it.I got to the shelter about 30 minutes before dark and got my water for the evening from a brook nearby. I washed myself real good and then cooked dinner. No other hikers showed up at the shelter so I got to spend the night all by myself listening to the brook and rain during the night.I was about to leave the next morning and an another hiker was coming southbound from the James River and told me he cleaned up all the spiderwebs for me. As all hikers know, if hiking early in the morning and you are the first out you generally clean the spiderwebs off the trail.Matt's Creek Shelter to Punchbowl Shelter. 12.7 milesI got up this morning planning to walk to Punch Bowl Shelter. This is only a little over 12 miles but I have two days to get to Buena Vista where I am picking up my shoes and another water filter. I am glad I had a short hike today because after crossing the James River the rain pounded almost all my entire hike to the shelter. The James River crosswalk is the longest crosswalk on the entire Appalachian Trail. The river was brimming bjecause of all the recent rains and it would have been nice to jump in but the weather was cool and there are signs that warns you that you should not jump off the bridge (tradition is that when you reach the James River bridge you jump off the bridge). It is not a high jump but it could be dangerous since you don't know what is under the water.I arrived at the shelter and immediately put some dry clothes on. I hung my bear rope up and hung my clothes over it to let them dry out. After awhile a married couple showed up that I had passed earlier. They got married last September and she was sharing with him how wonderful the trail can be. This was not the best time to share the trail because of all the rain. They plan to get off the trail and head to a hostile. Vinegar and Tornado showed up a little later so we had five people in the shelter that only holds six. We all got in our sleeping bags early.Punchbowl Shelter to Buena Vista, VA. 11.3milesI left the shelter about 730 to avoid the rain that everyone knew was coming. Along the way I stopped at a shelter for lunch and met Idgy and Poncho again (they are friends with Crazy Tree and planned to stay at the same hostile that he is staying). We ate our lunch and said our goodbyes and started hiking.As I approached US 60 I saw a man standing in a parking area by his car. His name was Charles Vance and he offered me a ride into Buena Vista. While we were talking Pops showed up southbound and he was also going in Buena Vista. We all hopped in Charles' car and went to town.When I got to the motel I took a bath and started walking toward town. I ended up at the Original Italian Restaurant and had one of the best eggplant Parmesan meals I've ever had. The people were real nice at the restaurant and provided great service.I plan to pick up my shoes and filter tomorrow along with other supplies and see if I can get to the next shelter.

Buena Vista to Seeley- Woodworth Shelter, 14.0 miles
I walked to Hardee's this morning in pretty heavy rain and got a couple of biscuits and a large cup of coffee. I stayed there for a little while drinking coffee until Family Dollar opened. I went in the Family Dollar and identified the items that I would pick up when I walked back from the post office. I went to the post office and The package that my wife mailed was there. It was raining pretty hard so the box got pretty wet by the time I got to Family Dollar. The lady at the store put the box behind the counter while I did my shopping. I walked back to the hotel and decided to stay since the rain continues pretty heavy and will continue most of the evening and the night. When I arrived back at the Buena Vista Hotel Norseman was there. There's another couple hikers here Unbreakable and Procrastinature. Norseman has been here two nights already and is planning to stay tonight. He's concerned about an expensive camera that he has that might get wet. We all plan to head out in the morning back on the trail since the rain should subside somewhat tomorrow.
We got a shuttle service to take us back to the trailhead.  It is still drizzling rain and it should end around noon.  Headed to Seeley-Woodworth Shelter if the rain holds off. It rained most of the day so it was good to get to a shelter.
Seeley- Woodworth Shelter to Harpers Creek Shelter, 14.2 miles. 
The weather has cleared some but the terrain is rocky and the hiking is slow. 
Harpers Creek Shelter to Campsite at mile marker 848.6, 14.7 miles 
Hiked most of the day alone. Decided to stealth camp in top of Humpback Mountain since a thunderstorm was approaching.  It rain during the night but the storm was a mild one. 
Campsite to Waynesboro, VA, 12.3 miles
Enjoyed the hike into Waynesboro, the day was sunny and mild.  Went to the YMCA and took a shower.  The people at the Y were very nice.  I pitched my tent at the park near the Y.  Also at the park were, Lilo , Stitch, Hilton, Northern , and Doc.  Most of us had a meal at the all you can eat China buffet.  Went to the laundry and washed my clothes. Got up the next morning and had a great breakfast at Weasie's Kitchen. Tom, a local trail angel drove me back to begin hiking through the Shenandoah National Park.
Waynesboro to Blackrock Hut, 20.7 miles.
I had a long day of hiking today.  Met very few people and walked alone. A lot of snakes are beginning to come out. Rattlers, moccasins, green snakes, and rat snakes have been seen. No bears yet. Got to the Hut, got water, washed off, cooked, and went to bed.
Blackrock Hut to Hightop Hut. 21.4 miles
I was planning a shorter day but the Pinefield Hut had notes in the log that copperheads were nesting beneath the building.  That was enough to send me to the next Hut.
Rabbit and Tofu (both from Germany) whom I sheltered with the night before were at the shelter when I arrived. I saw Puddin on the trail but he did not show up.
Hightop Hut to Bearfence Mountain Hut, 12.4 miles.
Woke up to a lousy day on the trail.  It was foggy and misting rain.  I was planning a long hike but it was just a nasty day as the rain began to get more intense.  At the Shelter, Lelo, Stitch, Puddin, and an AT ridge runner showed up. We were all ready to just eat and go to bed.
Bearfence Mountain to Byrd's Nest #3 Hut, 22.4 miles
I was hiking and about to go over a stream and a water moccasin jumped off a rock. I haven't jumped that high since high school, it scared the daylights out of me.  Got to the Hut and ABD a couple of SOBO's were there. Stitch, Lilo, and Puddin showed up. I got to see my first bear.  One of the SOBO's was behind the Shelter and called to let us know about the bear.  All I saw was his back end since the bear was running for the woods. I guess he saw so many humans it scared him.  Two oriental hikers showed up and could not find a place for their tent so we made room in the Hut.
 Byrd's Nest to Gravel Springs Hut. 17.5 miles 
Hiked to Elkwallow Wayside and enjoyed a Vegetarian bean burger, fries, and a soda.  Wayside's are along the trail in the Shenandoah's that provide supples and prepared food.  They are nice but the are expensive. Lilo, Stitch, and Puddin showed up before I left.  We all planned to make the Gravel Springs Hut.  This would be our last night in the Shenandoah's.  I made a fire she I got there but there was not enough dry wood to keep it going long.  Met a young man from Huntington Beach, CA, OC.  OC had hitchiked all the from CA without incident. He completed his degree at UCLA and just wants to travel the US and the rest of the world until he is 27.  He is getting off the trail in Harper""s Ferry and heading to D.C. I wish him well.

The hike today was rainy and cold.  The trail was covered with water for miles on end.  Walking in wet shoes and socks is no fun.  My feet were all shriveled up when I arrived at Dick's Dome.  Most of the streams were swollen so there was no way to cross without getting wet. We got into the roller coaster today and it's not as bad as expected. There are a lot of ups and downs and some rocks but it wasn't too bad of a hike today.
Dick's Dome to Bear's Den Hostel, 18.3 miles.
Today's hike was rainy and wet just like yesterday. We completed most of the roller coaster today and again it wasn't as tough as expected. Bears Den Hostel is a nice Hostel. As soon as I got there I took a shower and drank a couple of sodas. It was nice to be in a warm dry place. They also have a boot drying Machine that dries out wet shoes. I am certainly glad this machine was available since my hiking shoes were very wet. I had a pizza and a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream and a soda. The next morning I got up and made pancakes and headed out to Harpers Ferry.

We are finally out of Virginia and in West Virginia. Harpers Ferry is a nice town. I went by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to have my picture made to be put in there annual binder. I was hiker 133 northbound. The staff there was certainly nice and accommodating. The Hikers Lounge is real nice. They have sodas, Wi-Fi, and you can use their telephone if you have no connection on your cell phone. I stayed at the Towns Inn Hostel and it is real nice. They do have a café but it is limited. I had dinner last night at the Bistro next door to the end.

I spent the morning in Harpers Ferry Virginia looking at the old buildings there, getting breakfast, and then having lunch. I went by John Brown's museum that is located there. This city is full of historical facts and if you have a chance you should visit it. I had breakfast at a Step in Time Bakery. The Panini breakfast sandwiches were great. Also the coffee is a Keurig system but the coffee they provide is fantastic. It was a long walk from where I stayed to A Step In Time but it was worth the trip. I then went by the AT Conservancy again and saw Poncho and Idgey. They had just gotten in from a camping site about 4 miles south and waiting to have their picture taken at the AT Conservancy. Stitch and Lilo showed up about noon and we had lunch at the Coachhouse Grill. After lunch I had it out for the shelter. My left shoulder is aching and woke me up last night and I'm concerned about it.
Crampton Gap Shelter to Ensign Cowall Shelter, 20.7 miles
I had a great day hiking today. There are a lot of rocks on the trail in Maryland but there are also places that are easy to hike. The elevations of ups and downs are not big which allow me to hike faster. A surprise was coming across the Washington Monument state park at mile marker 1043.1. The citizens of this county erected the monument in honor of George Washington. A Group of kids from New York City showed up at the shelter about an hour after I got there. They had intended to put up their tents but there were not enough available spaces and they needed part of the shelter to sleep. The shelter was pretty crowded with hikers and the kids from New York City. I cooked and went to bed. I woke up around midnight with a sore shoulder. I could not go to back to sleep and spent most the night just sitting up until daylight. I was out of the shelter at 6:30 AM heading to Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. I hope the pain goes away so that I can continue hiking without taking a rest. I think I injured the shoulder hiking out of Buena Vista, Virginia on a cold, rainy day hiking up a mountain. It hasn't felt right since then and it probably needs some rest. 
Ensign Cowall Shelter to Waynesboro,  Pennsylvania, 9.5 miles
The trail today was very rocky but there were no steep climbs. The pain in my shoulder is not too bad while I'm hiking, but when I lie down at night it hurts. I got to Pen Mar County Park at the 1064.3 mile marker and a young lady there named Shannon shuttled me, Stitch and Lilo into Waynesboro. Lilo and Stitch are picking up supplies and continuing to hike, and I'm staying in Waynesboro to deal with my sore shoulder. I went to the pharmacy at Walmart in Waynesboro and the pharmacist gave me some ideas on what to do for my shoulder. The number one thing he mentioned was that I probably needed to rest it for a while. I did get some over-the-counter medications for my shoulder. I decided to go to the hotel to spend the night to see if my shoulder would get better. I'm staying at the Cobblestone Hotel in Waynesboro and it is a pretty nice hotel. The people here are certainly nice and accommodating. I had lunch at a Chinese buffet and dinner at Applebee's.  It is supposed to rain pretty heavy here for the next three days and I don't know what I'm going to do yet.

I am taking a ZERO today to go to a chiropractor to check my shoulder pain.
I went to see Dr. Melissa March in Waynesboro. She has an excellent bedside manner and was able to see me today even though I did not have an appointment. She adjusted my shoulder between the fourth and six rib cage on my right back. She assumes that the weight of the pack and dehydration probably caused the back pain. She suggested that I drink at least 64 ounces of water per day and more if the weather is hot. She provided several exercises to do while hiking in order to prevent this problem from happening in the future. If I still have some pain in the morning, Dr. March suggested I come back and have another adjustment tomorrow. It is raining today so it was a good day to be off the trail.  The rain is not supposed to stop until Saturday evening and I am a little bit concerned about getting out in the rain and cold with my back wow it is healing, so I'm going to have to make a decision of whether I am getting out in the weather again or wait until my shoulder heals.

Today I hiked over the Knife's Edge, which is a narrow seam of rocks that are very difficult to maneuver over. I am glad it was not raining since the rocks could be very slippery and a fall could result in serious injury. Today I also hiked up the Lehigh Gap rock climb. This is over 1000 feet of rock that you must climb with your pack and is almost straight up. It was a very difficult climb with a heavy pack. About halfway up Norm (think Cheers) came up behind me and said ""I got your back."" This was great because you could easily fall from those rocks and be hurt very, very bad. Norm and I made it to the top and he allowed me to crest the mountain first. That was very nice of him. After getting to the top of the mountain Norm stopped and found three ticks on him and one was embedded . As most hikers know ticks cause Lyme disease which could be very dangerous. He had no Vaseline to smother it so he used Chapstick. The tick released and he was able to remove it without incident. We both got water at the next stream because it would be 20 miles before we would have potable water again. Norm moved on and I found a tent site to stay the night.

It was raining so hard that I came within about 100 yards of a huge bear before he saw me and I saw him. Finally he saw me and took off running. I'm glad he started running because I was about to start running. I stopped at Leroy A. Smith shelter to get water and dry out.
