LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553920,"I am so excited to announce my plans to hike all 2,190 miles of the Appalachian Trail in order to raise awareness and funds for Talbot Interfaith Shelter and its mission to provide safe, temporary shelter to men, women, and children who lack adequate housing, and to raise awareness of the issues of homelessness in our community. Julie Lowe, Executive Director of Talbot Interfaith Shelter at Easton, MD, and Jayme Dingler, Fundraising Director, have done an awesome job of building the fundraising campaign called the “Long Walk Home.” I have a special interest in Talbot Interfaith Shelter because, although I choose to be homeless while on the trail, many homeless families are forced into that condition by any number of factors beyond their control. And it troubles me the number of homeless persons taking up shelter on the trail for lack of a home.I am thrilled to be able to combine my thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail with my desire to give back to my community. Hiking the Appalachian Trail while fundraising for Talbot Interfaith Shelter will allow me to combine my love for the outdoors with my desire to help homeless families. As anyone familiar with the Appalachian Trail will tell you, a thru-hike of all 2,190 miles is a monumental effort, with only one in four hikers completing the entire trail. Knowing that my efforts will benefit many families in need of adequate shelter motivates me all the more to complete this thru-hike. The difference that I know this hike will make in their lives is what will help me keep pressing on in the face of relentless rain and difficult physical challenges.I am maintaining this online journal of my hike, along with photos, videos, and more, as part of my AT thru-hike fundraising effort. Please also check Twitter at @RobertMessickat and Instagram at @robertmessickontheAT. Be sure to also check out the Long Walk Home fundraiser page at http://talbotinterfaithshelter.org/LongWalkHome.html where you can make a donation to, or volunteer services for, Talbot Interfaith Shelter.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Fri",0
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554074,"I spent the better part of the day with Bob Wenneson, Easton, MD, an experienced Appalachian Trail section hiker. Bob did a ""shake down"" of my backpacking gear, going through each item and questioning whether it should stay home or go into the backpack. I had spent a lot of time in past months researching backpacking gear, reading books and reviews, and testing the equipment I had purchased while backpacking. Most of the equipment passed Bob's muster. The biggest question mark was a stainless steel 2 cup thermos. At 11.7 ounces, it's difficult to justify lugging that thing over 2,190 miles. I'll have to make do with my Evernew Titanium Ultraight 900ml cookpot, weighing 4.1 ounces. How about the ZAGG Foldable Wireless Pocket Keyboard(weighing in at 7.3 oz.) for my iPhone so I can type my journal entries while on the trail? Since it expands to 85% of the size of a regular keyboard, it's going with me so I don't spend half the night pecking out text on my iPhone screen.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Wed",0
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554150,"Food preparation can be a significant part of preparing for an AT Thru-Hike. I say “can” only because most AT thru-hikers just wing it, resupplying at gas stations, convenience stores and, when available, grocery stores in towns near the trail. My desire to approach the task differently is partly attributable to being a “foody.” I am also an Ayurvedic Yoga Specialist striving to live and eat in accordance with Ayurveda, the sister science to Yoga, which encourages a healthy lifestyle and eating habits.In some respects, Ayurveda can make my diet on the trail more challenging. But as with all things in life, I need to balance my desire to follow Ayurveda with what will become an overwhelming physiological need for calories to fuel the tremendous physical exertion. It is said that thru-hikers need about 4,000 calories per day. So, while I must pack food with high caloric content, I also want my food to be healthy, nutritious, and satisfying. Well, that is my vision for now-- my values could change if my body tells me otherwise.With that background, perhaps you will understand better why I have made certain decisions about the thru-hike. I’m not asking you to agree with my decisions, but simply to follow along for the journey.",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Sat",0
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556048,"The weather was so foul today it presented an opportunity to train in weather I could easily encounter in the Great Smoky Mountains in late April. In my Outdoor Research Foray rain suit I stayed dry and warm, but was able to vent the pits once the sky began to clear. Although I didn't need to, I could have unzipped a portion of the legs to release heat as well. At the gym, after rowing, I also worked out on the treadmill for 45 minutes at 3 miles/hour on a 6% grade while carrying a 30 pound backpack. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't hard either. I was relaxed and able to maintain nostril breathing throughout. I had read on Whiteblaze.net that if you could pass this test, you were ready for the AT. It seems to me it sets the bar a bit low, because I know I will face inclines way beyond 6%. Therefore, I will continue to train on the treadmill with the maximum setting of 15%, for 5-minute intervals, mixed with 5-minute intervals at 4 miles/hour on the maximum decline setting of -3%.",,View Entry,"Mar 10, Fri",0
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560242,"A successful start to my AT Thru-Hike at Springer Mountain, meeting great people, enjoying beautiful weather, and seeing lovely scenery. I began the day in a state of panic,fearing I wouldn't fit everything Into my backpack. I sent home a silk sleeping bag liner and a few other things because they were too bulky. I thought I lost my cash and credit cards at the Hostel until I discovered I had already put them in my secret place. Then I settled down. On the drive to Springer Mountain I learned a good bit about how the Appalachian Trail Conservancy   is coping with the increasing popularity of the trail. Josh, the Former owner of Hiker Hostel,is on the ATC board of directors. It felt good to hike off the nervous energy. On the trail Adam my hiking partner today found a salamander giving birth. I video taped it for FB. I stopped by a pretty stream for brunch- my dehydrated polenta and scrambled eggs with red pepper salsa a day cheddar cheese. Very tasty!Kept the hike short today with 10 miles, finishing at Hawk Mountain Shelter about 3:00. While preparing my dinner of dehydrated shrimp etc a ""thru hiker"" told me he was planning to start with a 72 pound pack. fortunately a park ranger reduced it to 32 pounds once he confiscated two machetes and advised leaving behind, among other things, three knives and ten pounds of marbles to kill squirrels with his sling shot. The hiker admitted he much preferred raccoon. I plan an early start tomorrow to put in longer miles.","Springer Mountain

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560494,"Hiking today was more of a challenge than yesterday because I didn't get much sleep. It takes me a while to become accustomed to sleeping in a hammock. Of course the scenery was beautiful. I continued hiking with the hikers I started with on Day 1, Adam and Rebecca. As is typical on the trail, we didn't always hike together but would meet up for lunch and at camp in the evening. It's comforting to have co-hikers who look out for each other, share the experiences, and plan out each day. There is no guarantee that we will stick together due to differing hiking paces, goals, or possibly injuries. Hopefully we stick together.","hawk mountain shelter

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560526,"Today was a beautiful day for hiking. It was sunny to partly cloud, but a cool breeze. The sunrise was sweet. And hiking up Blood mountain was easier than expected. Upon arriving at Mountain Crossing, Neel Gap, thru-hikers were treated to ""trail magic."" I crossed the gateway from my pescitarian diet and ate two sausage burritos and washed it down with two Coca Colas. The bearers of such treats were a 2014 thru-hiker and his parents who traveled some distance from out of state. A few hours later, Oak Hill Baptist Church, Griffin, GA, had a contingent, including Shelly, serve up vegetarian and meat lasagne, French bread, dessert, and tea to the thru-hikers. There generosity was amazing, given that they drove nearly three hours to get here. And they are going to do it again at Unicoi Gap. The generosity and support of people associated with the Appalachian Trail will restore anyone's faith in humanity.","Ram Rock Mountain

Stopped on top of a mountain for brunch and couldn't get my alcohol stove to light in the strong wind. I'll choose a more protected place next time. Stopped for the night at Poplar Stamp Gap which had a beautiful stream nearby, allowing me to do my laundry, top off my water supply, and put water in my ""kitchen sink"" to soak my feet. Adam, with all of his backcountry skills, built a nice campfire in no time. Rebekah kept the conversation flowing. And Kevin ""White Squirrel"" has joined us to complete his section to Dick's Creek Gap.","Neel Gap

Although I left camp 45 minutes after Adam, Rebekah and Kevin, I nearly caught up because of the promise of trail Magic at Unicoi Gap. Oak Hill Baptist Church, Griffin, GA, provided the trail Magic, this time with grilled hamburgers and hot dogs, etc. they were an awesome group. We ended the day at Cheese Factory Site, a lovely campsite once occupying a cheese factory in the 1860's.","Poplar Stamp Gap

As usual, I was the last to leave camp in the morning,so I had catching up to do I order to get to the Top of Georgia Hostel by3. We planned to shower and change before taking the hostel shuttle into Hiawassee for supplies and dinner. I was afraid I might not meet the others ahead of me in time so I jogged the last 2+ miles downhill. When I Reached the road I stuck my thumb out and immediately got a ride to the hostel, passing Adam, Rebekah and White Squirrel along the way.

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561347,"While at Top of Georgia Hostel I met Little Red Caboose from Baltimore, MD. She was SOBO (southbound), having started her thru-hike in June 2016 at Mt. Katahdin and stopping at Damascus, VA, for the winter and then resuming in March. She said she had extensively researched her gear selections before beginning and had chosen the Warbonnet Blackbird hammock and Hammock Gear Cuban fiber tarp-- the same gear I chose for my hike. She was very satisfied with their performance. Before starting the day, Bob, proprietor of Top of Georgia Hostel, gave a presentation on successfully completing an AT thru-hike, based on his experience as a Triple Crowner (thru-hiking the AT, PCT, and CDT). We said goodbye to Kevin and welcomed Jörk into the group.Throughout the day, we generally gained elevation while entering the Southern Nantahala Wilderness in the Nantahala National Forest. We were elated when passing our first state line from Georgia to North Carolina. We felt like we were actually making progress. We ended the day at Whiteoak Stamp.","Dick's Creek Gap
",Whiteoak Stamp,"Apr 21, Fri",12.60
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561480,"For these last two days we have been hiking through forests damaged by forest fires. Because the forests are in the Southern Nantahala Wilderness, no effort apparently was made to fight the fires. Most of the rhododendron groves will likely die off, along with many of the trees which were burned through the cambium layer. 
We continued to climb in elevation to about 5,500 feet and noticed the temperatures dropping and the wind picking up. At times the sun came out and provided some warmth. We eventually stopped at Betty Creek Gap. 
That evening at 7:30 p.m., a woman named Stretch rolled in, still full of energy, even though having hiked 28 miles for 12 hours that day. We learned that she had previously hiked the PCT and CDT and was working on achieving the status of becoming a Triple Crowner (thru-hiking the AT, PCT, and CDT). Our conversation was interrupted by an approaching storm which delivered heavy rain throughout the night. Fortunately the hammock and contents stayed dry.","Whiteoak Stamp

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561481,"After waking in the morning, Rebekah found her tent submerged in a huge puddle of rain water. Surprisingly, her sleeping bag remained dry. Adam and Jörk also had wet tents and Jörk announced that he was a little bit dry. Discussions then ensued about going to the nearest town,Franklin, to check into a motel and dry out all their gear and belongings. Because my gear and belongings were relatively dry and I didn't need anything from town, I chose to continue hiking North in the rain, while Adam, Rebekah and Jörk caught a shuttle at Rock Gap after saying goodbye, not knowing if we would ever see each other again. It was a sad farewell since we had formed a close bond as a group. We hoped we would see each other again along the trail. While hiking, I passed the 100 Mile marker. Now I only need to repeat that distance 21 more times. The rain continued most of the day, turning the trail at times into flowing streams or completely submerged. As luck would have it, the rain fell harder upon reaching my destination, Moore Creek campsite, and made a challenge in keeping mud from splattering on everything. Fortunately my waterproof socks kept my feet dry while wearing trail runner shoes throughout the day. All in all, I feel pretty fortunate that the hike of 13 miles went well despite the rain. I could have gone further to Siler Bald Shelter but the rain and cold wind at the higher elevation would have made for a miserable night.","Betty Creek Gap
",Moore Creek campsite,"Apr 23, Sun",13
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561585,"I arrived the night before at Moore Creek campsite in a heavy downpour. Fortunately I stayed relatively dry. It's a simple fact that you will get wet and dirty backpacking and learning to accept the wet and dirt makes life on the trail easier. I never saw the hiker in my neighboring tent from the time I arrived in the late afternoon until I left the following morning even though we spoke briefly through his tent wall. I suspect he was resisting the rain. By midday the skies began to clear and even show some sunshine. So I took the opportunity to spread out my clothing and gear in the sun at Wayah Bald outlook to get rid of some of the dampness. I really felt like a homeless person with all my worldly possessions layed out while tourist, including a school group, walked by. I continued hiking until 6 p.m., racing to Big Branch campsite to beat the rain because the skies were looking ominous. I also wanted to put in more mileage so I could arrive earlier the next day at Nantahala Outdoor Center, 10 miles distant. At Big Branch campsite, I met up with a group of young men and women I had previously seen on the second day when I had given them food because they had lost some of their food. I was surprised to see them at the campsite since I hadn't seen them in the interim. They explained that they took one of the women to a doctor to treat a sprained ankle and had then jumped ahead on the trail, skipping a big portion so they could meet their objective of hiking to Damascus for the Trail Days Festival. I rather doubt they will make it unless they jump ahead again. It goes to show that we all hike our own hike in the way that suits our own goals and objectives.","Moore Creek campsite

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561792,"Departed Big Branch Campsite at 8 am and hustled to Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) 10 miles distant, arriving shortly after noon. I procured a private room at a cabin with laundry facilities so I could thoroughly clean and dry everything. But first I had lunch at River's End Restaurant, eating a one pound cheeseburger and two Sierra Nevada IPAs. I'm consciously trying to maintain high protein and carbohydrate intake to avoid loss of weight and muscle. I then made a visit to NOC Outfitters to buy a replacement pair of Superfeet insoles and denatured alcohol for my camp stove. I also picked up my Dropbox of resupplies. To my surprise I saw Adam, Rebekah and Jörk arrive about 5:30 as I was headed back to the general store to buy a new toothbrush. I had inadvertently thrown out my old toothbrush with my trash since I had stowed it in my odor proof bag to deter bears. Jörk shared his beautiful photos taken at Wesser Bald. When I passed through in the morning, it was still socked in with heavy fog, so there was nothing to see. But later in the day, when Jörk passed through, the sky had cleared beautifully. His photo showed on the horizon the Great Smoky Mountains, our next major destination.","Big Branch campsite
",Nantahala Outdoor Center,"Apr 25, Tue",9.60
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561985,"I met up with Adam, Rebekah and Jörk at the Nantahala Outdoor Center so Adam could buy some trekking poles at the outfitter. Up to now, Adam had been hiking with a walking staff he had carved. Adam has quite a talent for carving, having carved a spoon for Rebekah to replace her lost spoon and having carved wedding rings from antler and walnut for his former fiancé and himself. The day quickly warmed up to 86 degrees as we climbed more than 4,000 feet in elevation. The blue skies were welcome, as were the occasional cool breezes on the mountain tops, including Sassafras Mountain. Walking in the shade of the rhododendron groves also provided some relief from the heat. We took a longer than usual lunch at Sassafras Gap, enjoying the lively and colorful conversations. After such a tough climb, none of us were in any hurry to resume climbing more elevation. After topping off with water from the spring, we set off for more grueling work. We finally made it to Stecoah Gap about 6 pm and flopped down at a picnic table near the highway pullout. I tried to manifest a man driving up with an ice chest full of cold beer for us. The man did ultimately arrive, but apologized that he only had enough beer for his hiking friends he intended to meet there. Hikers Emily and her boyfriend ""Willie Nelson"" whom I'd seen over the last few days decided to hitch a ride to Stecoah Diner. Meanwhile Adam unsuccessfully tried ordering pizza for delivery to Stecoah Gap while Rebekah was exhausted to the point of incomprehension. Nobody seemed willing to do or decide anything, yet it was now 7 pm, with sunset only a hour away. So Jörk and I pressed on, hiking another mile to stealth camp. Lite Weight from Alberta Province, Canada, who we met at Stecoah Gap, arrived shortly thereafter. By the time we finished setting up hammocks and a tent, Adam and Rebekah arrived with two large pizzas, one vegetarian and one a meat extravaganza. Adam explained that the owner of a new hostel that hadn't got listed in the AT Guidebook offered them a ride to and from a nearby pizzeria. We gorged ourselves on pizza and trail food and promptly went to bed.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562843,"Another day of rain with scattered thunder storms. I had to pack up in the rain, but am able to keep everything pretty dry under the tarp as it goes into the backpack in a dry compactor bag. The tarp is the last item to disassemble and then goes in an outside pocket of the backpack. 
Once on the trail, the rain made it increasingly sloppy and slippery. Because of the steepness of the trail coming into Fontana, I had numerous slips and slides but fell only once, face first into the brush. I was surprised it hadn't happened sooner. 
While hiking during the day I met two women and a man hiking in the opposite direction and greeted them as SOBOs. The immediately asserted that they were NOBOs heading north, in the opposite direction from me. I thenCursed myself, thinking I had screwed up. However, after talking with them, I became more confident I was heading in the correct direction. I ran into them again later in the day at a shelter where they admitted they were in error. 
I finally arrived at Fontana a little after 12 p.m., lagging behind Adam, Rebekah and Jörk, who were waiting for the shuttle to Fontana Village Lodge where we were sharing a room, with Jörk being my bedmate. It was quite a change of circumstances to have a comfortable four poster bed.
The skies ultimately cleared to beautiful vistas of the Smokies, so we spread our gear and clothing out in the sun to dry out once again. We meet up with Emily and ""Willie Nelson"" at the grill for a lively dinner.","Stealth camp north of Stecoah Gap

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562852,"Today at Fontana Village is a Zero, a day of rest after hiking for two weeks straight. The last two days were particularly demanding to the point of exhaustion. 
We rose late and had a buffet breakfast at the Fontana Village restaurant before catching a shuttle to Robbinsville for shopping. I bought a new USB charger and a knee brace for my right knee which was wrenched in the previous day's fall. I then bought fresh vegetables, fruit and red wine for dinner before returning to Fontana Village. Yet I never had time for a nap that afternoon.   
Our shuttle driver Phil and his wife have been renting cabins to tourists and hikers for about 14 years, having moved here from Florida. They're ready to sell their business and resume his deep sea charter fishing business in the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida. One point of interest from our conversation during the drive was that Phil is a life-long Republican, yet couldn't vote for Trump and is anxious for Trump's departure. I told Phil my hope is that by the time I finish my hike in mid-September, Trump will be out of office. Is that wishful thinking? 
If you like the great outdoors and the treasures of our national parks and forests, you might want to visit them soon. There is no telling what Trump will do with them.","Fontana Village Lodge, Fontana Dam, NC

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562859,"I left Fontana Village hiking at a slower  pace because of my right knee and because I was carrying all the ingredients for a picnic in a bag strapped to my chest. After crossing Fontana Dam I settled into a picnic table savoring the view overlooking Fontana Dam. Adam, Rebekah and Jörk weren't interested in eating and continued hiking. Nevertheless, Tin Man, Fancy Pants, Clementine, and Low Key soon joined me and I was happy to share in the picnic which would have gone into the trash otherwise. 
Continuing on, progress was still slow because of my knee. I came to a complete standstill though once I learned from another hiker that a mother bear and cubs were very close to the trail. On further inspection I saw two cubs 75 feet up a tree right next to the trail and the mother bear hovering  nearby. 
More hikers came along, assessed the situation and decided I should lead the group, blowing my bear whistle loudly to drive the bears away. We progressed some distance, making a big ruckus, but retreated when the mother bear stood in an offensive position. 
We retraced our steps around a bend in the trail out of sight to the bears. One couple asked me to call the park'sranger ""bear expert"" for advice because they saw I had an iPhone as I was documenting the events. The expert told me we needed to wait one to two hours for the bears to disperse or we needed to return to our morning's point of origin. The later option was unacceptable so we waited for an hour further back on the trail, with more and more hikers adding to the road block. 
After some time a hiker volunteered to scout the situation and determined that the cubs and mother bear had all climbed other trees a little more distant from the trail. So we decided to move en masse along the trail in the hope the bears would scatter. We proceeded with some hesitation, while one hiker drew a handgun (illegal and ill-advised  in national parks) from his backpack. Initially it was uncertain whether the mother bear was moving toward us, but we pressed on nonetheless, anxious to get on with our hiking. Some of the hikers tried to take photos of the bears while rushing and stumbling forward. The bear and cubs ultimately climbed further up the mountain away from the trail and reduced the risk of an encounter. 
Due to the bear road block delays, which lasted more than two hours, I knew I couldn't catch up with Adam, Rebekah and Jörk, so I decided to stay at the next available campsite because it was already past sunset and hiking at night in the Smokies is risky, due to the prevalence of bears roaming at night.","Fontana Village Lodge, Fontana Dam, NC
",Birch Spring Gap campsite,"Apr 29, Sat",7.20
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562887,"When I started the day, I was still about 6 miles behind Adam, Rebekah and Jörk and didn't think it likely I could catch-up with them. Jörk had sent me a text advising that they intended to stay at Siler Bald Shelter.  To hike that far would be 23 miles, which was out of the question. So I resolved to hike to Derrick Knob Shelter. 
Based on my AT Trail Guidebook, I crossed from North Carolina to Tennessee at Mile 173.9.
Toward the end of the day, the trail came to open balds, including Rocky  Top and Thunderhead Mountain,  with panoramic views. Since it was Sunday, some day hikers were on the trail too. 
Before sunset I was glad to see ""Willie Nelson"" and Emily pass me as they were headed to the same destination, Derrick Knob Shelter. I arrived about 9 pm as hikers were heading to bed. I set up camp fairly quickly and downed a tortilla and peanut butter to give me some heat for the night, as the wind was blowing hard and the temperature dropping. 
I didn't bother to gather drinking water because I didn't want to disturb the sleeping hikers. I put my backpack and bear bag on a bear cable and went to bed.","Birch Spring Gap campsite
",Derrick Knob Shelter,"Apr 30, Sun",17.20
LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562908,"I awoke to my 4 am alarm planning to get an early start in the hope of catching the group. However, the wind was howling and the rain was heavy. It didn't seem safe to hike in such high wind, with the possibility of blow down (trees and limbs blown down by heavy wind), so I dozed for awhile and contemplated what to do. 
Within an hour, even though the storm had not abated, I decided to get going and dressed, which in itself takes about 45 minutes when squirming around in the hammock and losing  things among all the jumble, not to mention putting on all my foot and leg gear- a lengthy topic for another discussion. It took extra long to undress/redress this time because I went to bed the previous night wearing practically all of my clothing to protect against the cold at the higher elevation. 
When I took my first step out of the hammock, I could hardly bear weight on my right knee. I was very thirsty, having elected not to gather water the night before, but didn't have any water to swallow ibuprofen, so I hobbled over to the shelter and got some water from a generous hiker. I took the pills and waited in my hammock for the Magic to begin.   
I have found that, for me, knee and foot pain diminishes after I've been hiking for awhile. I attribute it to endorphins, which according to Wikipedia, are a morphine-like compound produced by the body which ""inhibit the transmission of pain signals and produce a feeling of euphoria very similar to that produced by other opioids.""  I have experienced the pain reduction but unfortunately  not the euphoria.  I suspect I would experience the euphoria only at the expense of permanent damage to my body. 
After I got underway, I realized the storm was pretty serious (gauged from my experience sailing), with winds reaching 50-60 miles per hour and throwing me off balance. Because of its force, I couldn't tell whether the heavy precipitation was rain or sleet.  My Outdoor Research Helium 2 rainwear wasn't up to the task of effectively being shot at by a pressurized fire hose.  I was soaked through and cold. 
To my amazement and horror, an older hiker passed me in the opposite direction wearing a John Deere cap, T-shirt, shorts, and backpack covered with a flimsy dry-cleaner bag. I warned him about hypothermia, which can occur below 60 degrees (here it was no more than 40 degrees), and wished him a safe journey, after advising him to pick up a backpack cover I had seen on the ground (obviously torn by the wind from another hiker's backpack). The troubling thing is that hapless people aren't even aware when they fall victim to hypothermia. 
I trudged on and was met by two determined women hiking in the opposite direction. I asked how far it was to my destination, Silers Bald Shelter, and was happily told that someone had a fire going in the shelter fireplace. I knew had to be Adam, since he has the knowledge to start and maintain a camp fire in any conditions.  One of his tricks is to use Birch bark, which will burn even when wet. After I finally arrived at Silers Bald Shelter, Adam later explained that he also had some help from someone's Fat Wood and one of Rebekah's unused Tampons. 
When I arrived at the stone shelter, it felt like stepping into a frontier shelter from a Spaghetti Western. It was dark, save some light flickering in the fireplace, very damp, with the wind gusting in through the tarp strewn across the open front, and bodies filling all the voids-- since very few hikers were willing to be out in the elements. Some of the hikers on the upper sleeping level were passing the time against the storm playing dice while others took turns warming by the fire. 
Eventually I had my turn at the fire and felt some life return to my body. I then cooked up a double portion of my favorite meal-- polenta, scrambled eggs, red pepper salsa and cheddar cheese. 
I had claimed a space on the upper level of the shelter to sleep for the night, figuring the upper level would be warmer. However, the sky cleared and the wind abated around 3 pm, so I decided to sleep instead in my hammock below the ridge where it was more protected from the wind, still blowing about 25 miles per hour. Unfortunately it was too late by then to put in any more miles for the day so I filled my water bottles in preparation for the next day, put on all of my clothes in my possession, including my rain coat, and went to bed in my hammock. As I peered out of my hammock, I could see the night lights of Gatlinburg, TN, far below, beckoning me.","Derrick Knob Shelter

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563037,"I started the day early knowing I would eventually be trailing behind Adam, Rebekah and Jörk, due to my tender knee.  I set off at 7 am, while Jörk later informed me that he left at 8 and Adam and Rebekah not long afterwards. Jörk caught up with me shortly before Clingman's Dome. 
The hike was interesting because of the changing vegetation at higher elevations. Hemlock and firs became the predominate trees toward Clingman's Dome. Of course, the temperature dropped and the wind became much stronger.  
Once I reached Clingman's Dome, the highest elevation on the AT at 6,643 feet, I ascended the observation tower.                 To my surprise the nearly 200 Feet height of the tower is officially counted in the dome's total elevation (at least according to a local). The views from the tower were interesting, but not spectacular, like in Western Mountains. Because the Appalachians are the oldest mountains in the world, they are remnants of their former majesty once towering the heights of the Himalayans.  
On the descent to lower elevations, the forests looked more like rain forests with moss and ferns covering everything. When I walked off of the trail into the forest, the ground was a thick mat of spongy decomposing vegetation. 
Once I reached Newfound Gap, Adam, Rebekah and Jörk were already gone so I hitched a ride to Gatlinburg with Emily, ""Willie Nelson,"" and three other hikers I knew in the back of a pickup truck. The driver was very gracious, hailing from New Orleans, LA, and said he wanted to pay forward the favor. 
Upon arriving at the NOC Outfitter to pick up my drop box mailed by my life partner and Trail boss Lynda, I checked into Travelodge Motel, hand washed my laundry, and cleaned my gear. 
Through a phone conversation and texts with Jörk, I determined that they had other plans and I was happy to move on. What were once plutonic relations among the group appeared to be changing, with one member becoming an ""item,"" as it's said on the Survivor TV series. Once that happens the whole dynamic of the group changes, in my opinion, for the worse. Therefore, I said goodbye to Jörk, whom I hold in high esteem. 
I had dinner at a local restaurant and literally stuffed myself. After making it back to the room, I resolved to eat out less often.","Silers Bald Shelter

I had met a Ridge Runner the day before and she recommended RICE for my knee, as did a hiker I met along the trail who had wrenched her knee and taken a double Zero to heal it.  
I spent the better part of the day in bed treating my elevated  knee alternately with ice packs and a compression bandage.  The day outside appeared beautiful but I could only enjoy the beautiful  sound of the river flowing by the Travelodge
I eventually walked some blocks around Gatlinburg to discover the peculiarities of the town. I took a number of photos to document the unbelievable and indescribable. Gatlinburg reminded me of Ocean City, MD, on steroids. 
I went to bed that night with my knee feeling pretty good and up for beating the trail. However, after the bravado subsided, I checked the weather and discovered that an 80 mph wind storm was forecast for the entire next day, so I elected to take another Zero for my knee at the Gatlinburg Travelodge.","Newfound Gap/Gatlinburg

I continued to elevate and ice my knee throughout the day and catch up on my trail journal and Facebook entries.  
I culled through my mail drop resupply box to reduce the weight and headed for the NOC Outpost to contribute the excess to the hiker box.  Along the way, I ran into the young Christian hiker group I'd met several times before along the trail and to whom I'd  given everything I didn't need. I once again happily gave them my excess food and supplies. They had made pretty good progress and the young lady's sprained ankle was much better. 
 I stopped at Walgreens to get a few items and was warned by the checkout clerk to be safe and watch out for criminals and pickpockets in Gatlinburg. It made me think I was safer in the forest with bears. I tried to pick up my speed while hobbling so as not to advertise my vulnerability.

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563714,"After having a hearty breakfast at Travelodge, I arranged for a shuttle to take me back to Newfound Gap to continue on the trail. The driver and owner, Carol, informed me that due to the severe blow-down on the trail, snow, sleet and freezing rain on the steep park roads, and continuing high winds, theNational Park Service had closed the Great Smoky Mountains National Park through Sunday, May 7. She also said the park rangers were trying to get the thru-hikers off the mountain. Consequently there was no way to get the 15 mile climb up 3,500 feet back to Newfound Gap by vehicle.       The alternatives were to stay put at the Travelodge for three more days, stealth hike past the park rangers through the closed park to Newfound Gap for two or more days in snow, freezing rain and high winds and then resume hiking the AT after frozen and completely exhausted, or have Carol drive me to the northern border of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and continue hiking the AT North from Davenport Gap. I chose the later option since I had read that it was acceptable to jump ahead when a portion of the trail was closed by government authorities. 
Although I started the hike with a purist mentality, I.e., I was going to hike each and every white-blazed mile of the trail, I realized that in order to finish the hike before Mount Katahdin  closed in mid- October or sooner, I needed to adjust my principles. Due to my age and recurring knee problems, I wasn't going to be a slave to the ultra-purist attitude that the AT never closes, regardless of forest fires, pandemics on the trail, hazardous and deadly weather conditions, etc. 
Choosing to resume at the northern  border of the park,  aril drove me to Standing Bear Farm Hostel near Davenport Gap. During the drive, she informed me about the terrible forest fires in and around Gatlinburg last year. After the authorities offered a $50,000 award for information leading to the arrest of the individuals who intentionally set the fire, a man stepped forward with his video taken the days of the initial event of two 15 and 16 year old boys dousing the forest with gasoline and throwing lit matches on the fuel. Apparently the owner of the video didn't remember he had taken the video u Gil his memory was jogged by the $50,000 award. 
The official count is 14 deaths from the     forest fire. It doesn't include the 50-some illegal immigrants succumbing in weekly re tap units engulfed in flames and undocumented homeless individuals. 
Many  businesses and homes were destroyed by the forest fire, leaving many people homeless. A number of families ended up living in rental storage facilities. However, according to Carol, FEMA threw a lot of misallocated resources at the problem. 
Because Gatlinburg is a large tourist town with a desire to downplay the entire conflagration, officials wouldn't include illegal immigrants and homeless individuals in the death toll unless individuals stepped forward and identified the bodies.
Carol dropped me off at Standing Bear Farm Hostel so I could check on Jörg's whereabouts.  I was informed that he had left early that morning, so I thought perhaps I would meet him at Roaring Fork Shelter, about 18 miles out, or the following day at Hot  Springs. 
I rather enjoyed the trail that day, with soft underfooting rather than lots of rocks, as in the past. The terrain was also more interesting to me, with large oak and ash trees, interspersed with meadows on balds and lovely ground vegetation, including blooming Trillium.  
Because of the passing storm, the weather was very fickle, requiring me to don and remove my rainwear and cold weather wear many times.  Eventually the weather turned to steady rain in the mid-afternoon and continued through the night and the entire next day.","Davenport Gap

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563816,"I awoke early to rain, planning to get an early start so I could complete the 17.9 mile hike to Hot Springs. It turned out to be a miserable day with driving freezing rain, sleet and snow, depending on the elevation.  By the end of the day, I was chilled to the bone. 
The weather created a challenge in trying to stay warm, but not getting  too warm. Once the body gets too warm and sweats the clothes, there is a higher risk of hypothermia if the ambient temperature drops.
Although it snowed throughout much of the day, it didn't accumulate to any measurable extent. I videoed the snow falling at one point, which  reminded me of the scene from the Wizard of Oz movie when the good witch causes the snow fall to cancel the drug-induced effects of the poppy fields. 
I kept hiking on, but the pain in my knees was causing me to go at such a slow pace that I wondered  whether I could possibly get to Hot Springs before dark. As though the  wonderful witch from the North appeared out of the Wizard of Oz, Erika, a weekend hiker who had decided against camping at the cold, snowy higher elevations, arranged to have friends pick her up at Garenflo Gap, a little used secondary road intersecting the AT, and offered me a ride to Hot Springs; thus cutting my misery by 6.6 miles.  
I was never so happy to be riding in the back of a pickup weaving down and down through the ridgelets to Hot Springs. I even arrived in time for an excellent vegetarian dinner at Elmer's Sunnybank Inn, my destination for the night. 
Elmer, owner of Sunnybank Inn and a former AT thru-hiker and Peace Corp volunteer in the early 1970's, made a delicious Brussels Sprout and mushroom soup, of which I had two bowls to take the chill out of my bones. Then he served a sumptuous green salad, of which I had four servings. Then he served one of the best vegetarian lasagnes I have ever had, with a Filo dough and slivered almond topping. AND THEN he served a delicious pecan pie with a great crust, and just the right sweetness. AND THEN he served a lovely mint tea that soothed the soul. It was magical. 
It didn't take much to coax me to my four poster bed with a canopy formed by my air drying hammock and my top quilt as a comforter, while contentedly falling asleep.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Unlike me, Jörg didn't Zero at Gatlinburg so he returned to the trail with reasonably good weather. However, on his second day out, a huge wind storm blowing up to 80 mph hit the mountains, while it was blowing about 45 mph in Gatlinburg where I was zeroing. Jörg said the wind was so strong it pressed the trees along the trail so far over that it would heave the trail up through the root system.  He thus had to pause for the wind to subside and the trail to flatten out before proceeding during those occasions. 
Jörg confessed that, in being on the trail that day, he wasn't sure whether he had crossed the threshold from being brave  to being stupid.  Meanwhile, I was resting my knee in bed at Gatlinburg where the wind had knocked out electric power for most of the day. Unlike Jörg, I had learned the prior night about the severe wind warning and had chosen to rest my knee another day instead of taking the risk of hiking that day. I later learned from Jörg that a number of hikers were injured from falling trees and limbs. Jörg had a big tree fall several hundred feet from him, which was enough to rattle him. Additionally, while hiking along a very narrow crest of the mountain, Jörg struggled to keep the wind from throwing him over the edge to the depths below. 
After visiting Jörg for lunch and making arrangements to meet for dinner, I returned to the Hostel and slept until 5 pm. I met Jörg and a young female German hiker from Hamburg for dinner at Spring Creek Tavern on a covered deck overlooking the lovely creek. We had a lively conversation comparing the ways Germans and other Europeans raise their children. Sadly, the dinner came to an end and we sad goodbye once again, but this time knowing the likelihood of meeting again on the trail was pretty remote since Jörg was a fast hiker and I had to nurse my knees.","Hot Springs

LongWalk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563818,"On the advise of Elmer, owner of Sunnybank Inn, I visited the Hot Springs Medical Center and had my knees examined and X-rayed by a doctor. She found no fractures or tears, but gave me a steroid shot and a week's prescription of  Prednisone for the inflammation. She seemed well versed in the ways of thru-hikers and advised that I rest for three days and have mineral spring soaks and a massage at the Hot Springs Spa. 
I was all for that so I visited the spa and had my first mineral spring soak in a hot tub filled with mineral water from the hot springs. It was very soothing and relaxing and seemed to reduce the swelling in my right lower leg and ankle. 
I also moved from Sunnybank Inn to Alpine Court Motel to avoid climbing stairs and to be more centrally located within Hot Springs.  Much of Hot Springs lacks cell service due to being surrounded by high  mountains, so Spring Creek Tavern, with good Wi-Fi service, became a favorite hangout as I updated my trail journal and Facebook posts and responded to emails and general business.  
I learned from several locals that a vexatious person had set the surrounding forests on fire last year with the intention of burning down Hot Springs. Fortunately the town was much more proactive than Gatlinburg in fighting the forest fires and apparently didn't suffer any loss of life or property, yet it was a scary situation for the residents, with the air filled with smoke and the fire encroaching the town. 
I was told that Gatlinburg initially didn't fight the intentionally set forest fires for several weeks, apparently thinking they would burn out of their own accord. But when a wind storm served up 80 mph winds (like the other day), the forest fires quickly spread to the city as fire balls were spewn from the burning trees as much as one-half mile away.  Unlike the Gatlinburg arsonists, the Hot Springs arsonist was never caught.","Hot Springs

The hot tub, filled with healing mineral spring water from the property, had a private bucolic view of the French Broad River. 
As I soaked in the hot tub (aided by Prednisone and Aleve), my mind and body drifted back to an episode in my life in California-- the hot tub capital of the world. I was then a Trial Attorney with the Tax Division of the U.S. Department of Justice representing the Internal Revenue Service in complex tax litigation, only this case wasn't so legally or factually complex. 
The taxpayer, a young professional who was a very active member of the Northern California Corvette Club, was also a minister ordained by Universal Life Church (ULC), a mom and pop mail order ministry operating out of Modesto, California.  
The taxpayer was claiming a charitable contribution deduction for all of his professional income ""donated"" to his ""church.""  In turn, his church was paying all of his living and household expenses for his ""parsonage.""
At trial, the taxpayer admitted that his mixed-gender congregation would typically begin their worship by first driving their Corvettes around Napa Valley and then convening at his ""church"" to continue the religious ritual of everyone climbing into the church hot tub and fervently laying on the hands. Fortunately, the California  jury, typically a wild card, didn't buy it and found in favor of my client, the IRS, which was then  committing an inordinate amount of resources, naturally at taxpayer expense, to battling ULC and its pervasive tax scams. 
After drifting back to the present, I later learned, much to my surprise and delight,  that Erika Berger, Philadelphia, PA, who, with her friends, had saved me with a ride from Garenflo Gap to Hot Springs, made a donation to Talbot Interfaith Shelter's Long Walk Home Fundraiser. I was completely overwhelmed and nearly brought to tears, realizing that a complete stranger, to whom I'd given my Long Walk Home card, felt compelled to make a donation to a homeless shelter in a community with which she will likely never have any  association. The act underscored once again just how kind and generous people really can be, even when there is absolutely no likelihood of receiving something in return.

Approximately 25% of hikers quickly drop out within the first three days of hiking, upon reaching Neels Gap which has a large tree unceremoniously festooned with hikers' boots. The usual excuse is that it wasn't what they expected it to be. A number of other hikers are just plain ill-prepared and ill-equipped.
Another 25% of hikers typically drop out by Hot Springs, NC. By this point, the cause is more often physical injuries where the joints are overtaxed.  I seem to fall perilously close to this category.
Another 25% of hikers frequently drop out by Harpers Ferry, WV, the psychological half-way point. By then, hikers are suffering from the Virginia Blues, mentally exhausted from hiking an entire month just to cross Virginia, the longest state at 556 miles. 
Another 10-15% of hikers suffer from physical abuse along the remainder of the trail. Pennsylvania presents large rock obstacles which are particularly adept at severely spraining ankles. And then the White Mountains, which are especially steep, with perilous cliffs, provide ample opportunities for fractured limbs, and worse, from falls.   
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), the administrative body for the trail, states that the completion rate by thru-hikers is about 25%.  However, one board member of the ATC in Georgia informally advised me he believes that percentage is overstated since the completion rate consistently ran about 10-15% for a number of years but then jumped to about 25% around 2008 and has held there since. He attributed the higher rate to falsely reported completions, where hikers would ""yellow blaze,"" by jumping ahead along the trail in vehicles, or even ""aqua blaze,"" by canoeing or kayaking the Shenandoah River instead of hiking Shenandoah National Park.  
Thru-hiker completions are self-reported, with no oversight or verification by the ATC, so there is no way of knowing the true completion/attrition rate.","Damascus
