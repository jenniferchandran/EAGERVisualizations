Shannon Holliday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554274,"I wasn't sure doing an online journal was something I was up for. I'm still not sure actually. But I thought I'd start now, pre-hike, and see if I can't keep up with it for the long haul. Six weeks and three days. That's how much time I have left to get my sh*t together for this upcoming walk. I think gear is pretty much gathered. All I have left to do there is figure out how to use it all. And get it all to fit in my bag. Food prep is my biggest headache at this time. Deciding on mail drops or town resupplies comprises my greatest hangup. I'm almost over the whole planning thing and am considering winging the rest...However, there was a recent dilemma brought to my attention, that does in fact requiring more planning on my end. I am of course speaking of Baxter State Park's implementation of capping thru-hikers up Katahdin. Because I am still researching this new information, I will save my thought process on it for another entry (See, I'm leaving myself reason to keep this up!) Until then...",,And so it starts...,"Feb 07, Tue",0
Shannon Holliday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554587,"Spent the weekend alone, which gave me some time to organize my gear and decide what's going where. I laid all that I have here in the city out and started stuffing. Stuff sacks! Honestly, I was surprised that it all fit. (I should add however there are few more items that will need stuffing, but they are back home Upstate). I had plans do to some city hiking with the pack on, but a beautiful nor'easter came blowing through bringing sleet and snow, and I opted for a day indoors. I'm sure some of you are saying at this time 'would have been good practice Shan to hike in the elements! etc etc etc' But let me tell ya, there will be plenty more days of rain in the Big Apple this time of year, and lots more snow back home to prepare me before I take off. 
Getting excited! 
Until then...",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Tue",0
Shannon Holliday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555058,"Have been able to snag one city walk. We've had some nice weather as of late and we decided to take advantage. Except it didn't actually end up being a nice day and we ended up cutting it short. The sun was shining yes, but the wind was howling and made for an uncomfortable walk. The positive in this is that I now know that if it's 34 degrees and windy, I will be cold wearing what I thought I'd be sweating in. Good to know for next time. This has also brought me to begin checking the weather down in GA. 50s and 60s sound very comfortable; hopefully it will stay that way.
Until then...",,Urban Walks,"Feb 24, Fri",0
