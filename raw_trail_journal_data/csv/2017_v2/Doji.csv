Doji,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572990,"We arrived in White River Junction, VT last night. The weather forecast for Monday and Tuesday was all day rain. After Bunkie dealt with all the logistics we decided to just do a 10 mile walk. This morning we began and completed 10 miles in the rain. This is my first day EVER as a backpacker on the AT and I thought it went pretty well, despite the weather. I saw my first ""trail magic"" and even indulged in a wonderful piece of watermelon from the stash! We also saw 2 deer and about 11 other humans and 2 canines on the trail. We decided on a hotel tonight mainly because of the weather but starting tomorrow it will be true backpacking!","

Doji,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573406,"We began at 8:11am.  The trail is very different than I expected.  I thought there would be more ""views"" throughout the day but it truly is. ""Green Tunnel"".   There were2 areas that had beautiful views which i got quick pics of.  The other fun and intersting challenge was crosing a large running creek holding a guide wire and not getting wet.  Hopefully the photos and bideo will upload!  Bunkie walked a her pace and i walked at mine so i was a bit behind but there were notes along the way telling me how much further to a rest area or water source.  The ligistics of hiking this monster are incredable.  Knowing when ypu need to fill your water bottles to knowing how much further you need to go to get to an area that is suitable to pitch the tent.  At about 12 miles my right knee began to pain.  This is not a good sign, although continuing on.  The changes in elevation today were crazy.  We went from 800 to 2000ft then back down to 1200 and 700 and back up to 2100.  Everytime another incline would come I'd be praying for a downhill and then the downhills would come and the knee experienced more pain.  So needless to say when i arrived at the shelter (small 3 sided wood building) I was very grateful. The tents got set up and we luckily got the last 2 cleared flat areas for tents.  I had no appetite although had some chickpeas and protein bar and alot of water.  A little concerned about the knee pain but will continue on as I can We accomplished over 16 miles today!   ","

Doji,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573413,"Up at 5:15am break down camp, brush teeth, pack up and walk.  The first goal was 2 miles to a small cabin known as the lookout.  Several people in passing told us to be sure to go 2/10ths off trail to see the spectacular views.  We decided that would be our breakfast stop.  My knee began to give me problems immediately but i just kept praying that it would work itself out.  By the time we got to the Lookout, i was hurting bad.  Bunkie took a look at the logistics of me being able to find an off shoot from the trail and id catch a ride to the predetermined deatination for that evening.   However the closest cross road that i may have found a ride was still 12 or so miles.   Our goal was to go another 16.5 or so today.  After eating our peanut butter and protein bar breakfast and climbing to the top of the lookout for some fanatastic views,  we began again.   Although yesterday i was praying for downhill today I was praying for uphill.  The knee seeemed to hurt more going down.  So of course today seemednto be mire downhill and after about 2 hours the only way i could go down some of the steep areas was backward.  There was no way to put any pressure on the knee going forward.  At somepoint i said i have to stop.  Bunkies assessment at this point, accordinb to the map, was another 9 miles to a road.  Here is where the ""The God Things""  began.  First a hiker named Ash stopped and offered to carry my pack, although i thanked him, i said no.  He did however give me some advil!!  Next i passed 2 wonderful hilers with digs who were doing thru hikes and that gave me some incentive that if thise little pups could do it carrying their own little packs, I could certainly make it to the road!  Of course having about 15 hikers pass me disnt do any good for the ego!  During this slow walk though i came to acceptance that although i havemt done many miles ive done more than alot and I gabe it my best!  Eventually a young hiker said I have a message   Bunki is less than a mile at the road!  Ehat a relief.   So as i stumbled forward slipping and sliding and stepping down backward through tree roots and rocks i finally got there.  God Thing #2  this road was not the road 9 miles away ( this toad was not on the map)  it was a dirt road however there a Park Service Vehicle parkers there, as well as a car from Massachusetts.  No people but cars, just a matter of time   Bunkie did a recon mission to see if she could get any info, to no avail!  So several hours, proabably 3 or so a young man emerged from the trail carrying trail maintenance equipment.  He was with the Vermont Youth Conservation Corp and was checking on a group working in this area.  His name, Wyatt.  Wyatt gave us a ride to a small town gas station country store in Pittsfield.  We hitched a ride with Mindy who took us to Killington and then hitched another ride from Killington to Rutland!  Then stayed at the Yellow Deli Hostel!  What a really cool place and great food!   Lots if stories.  However with all this my knee continued to get worse and not even a hot shower helped.  So major decision time.  The trail will always be here but its time for me to say farewell.  My outdoor passion is snow skiing and the last thing I want to do is to damage something that not allow me to ski this winter!  So farewell, for now, to the Green Tunnel.  Many thanks to Bunkie for her strength and guidance and  patience.  I'll have more to say in tomorrows entry ","

Doji,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573435,"My emotions concerning not being able to go further on the trail are mixed.  I didnt have a real goal asI was trey taking it one step and one day at a time.  I cant say im dissapoinred but i wish i could have done more!  I certainly learned alot in a very few days!  As i said the logistics are incredable,  its not just a walk in the woods.  I learned to listen to my body.  Im usually so stubborn but this time i surrendered and am glad i did.  I thought alit about why this was happening...is there somthing that i need to be home for????  I guess only time will  answer that question.  Is this the warning call for my knee to ensure that its healthy for snow akiimg???  Many questions, maybe they will. E answered and maybe not.  I believe that everything happens for a reason and that there are no coincidences so only time will tell.  I enjoyed my short 36 miles on the trail and feelmproud that i made it that far.  I will be in awe of anyone who walks this trail!  Today the trail won  ut ya know the trail isnt going anywhere So maybe ill be back to enjoy its beauty and challenge another dayPS. An immediate good thing that hapened was that Bunkie made a call to a former collegue to get a ride and became aware if a retirement party for her former support staff in the Burlington Office.  So she was able to attend that party as a surprise to the retiree!","
