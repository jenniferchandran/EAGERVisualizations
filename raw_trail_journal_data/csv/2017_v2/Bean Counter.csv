Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562746,"Well it's been almost two years since I got off the trail just north of Waynesboro ending my attempt at a thru-hike. It was tough getting off the trail that day in June but it was nothing I could help. I had to heal. On my drive home over two days I made a decision that I would finish the trail one day as a section hiker no matter how long it took. As you remember I had just retired three weeks before I left Georgia and I when I got home it took me a little while to get used to being retired. Once I healed I found a new sport called ""Pickle Ball"" that I just love and having been playing for about 1 1/2 years now. It is a good workout and has kept me from gaining all my weight back although just barely.I had wanted to return to the trail in 2016 but things just didn't work out. Our youngest daughter got engaged and we had a wedding to plan (clarification, my wife and daughter had a wedding to plan, they just needed my wallet lol) but we were also planning on moving to Georgia after the wedding and we made several trips to Georgia looking for a place to live.Since I wasn't going to get back to the trail in 2016 I purchased a bicycle and decided to ride the Natchez Trace from  Natchez to Nashville and back to Natchez over a two week period. The first week was fun but the second week was all rain in addition to me trying to tune up my bicycle but ended up only being able to get one gear. I was only 60 miles from the nearest bike shop so I used some of my AT experience and stuck the old thumb out and got a ride to a bike shop.  I was one happy rider when my wife and daughter showed up to pick me up on that Friday night. I think the biggest difference between this trip and hiking was I was always alone at the end of the day. I would pass other riders during the day but never stayed at the same location with any other riders. I rode almost as many miles in two weeks as I walked in 3 months on the AT.If you would like to read my journal from the bike trip you can go to www.crazyguyonabike.com/beancounter  
Stay tuned for 2017 hiking plans.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Wed",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562956,"On March 31st our youngest daughter Stephanie married Dan, who by the way just happens to be a great guy. We now have two great son-in-laws that my wife and I couldn't be more happy about. The picture is of the Bean Counter, Mrs. Bean Counter (Cathy) the bride Stephanie, and our older daughter Ashley. It was a great evening for a wedding and a great night that we got to meet Dan's family from Canada. I'm not sure what the Canadians though of us southern Louisiana rednecks but I believe they enjoyed every minute of their time down south. (If for no other reason it wasn't cold and we do know how to throw a party)
It was the start of a busy time for us. After making it home after the wedding on Saturday we left on Monday driving to Oklahoma City to see our older daughter and her husband Nathan. They have some great things going on in their life right now but more about that later. We spent a few days with them and returned home still trying to recover from the wedding. We had been fortunate enough to sell our house a couple weeks after listing it and only had a couple of weeks to get everything out of the house before closing. We had purchased our house in Clarkesville Georgia (Very close to Dicks Creek Gap, Neels Gap and Springer Mountain) back in January so we were ready and excited about getting moved. We had already moved a couple of loads to de-clutter the house before we put it on the market so we thought we could get everything left in one uhaul truck, our car and truck. I hired two guys to load the truck and they were great. They got just about everything in that truck but we almost killed ourselves trying to get everything packed for them to load. We actually could have given ourselves a few more days to pack but we were so excited to move that we didn't want to wait any longer.
I drove all through the night to get to Clarkesville because if you watch the news you know I-85 was shutdown in Atlanta and I knew the traffic would be terrible so I wanted to make sure I went through Atlanta during the late overnight hours. I did, but there was still a lot of traffic on I-285. We are here now, mostly unpacked but with a basement full of boxes that we will go through one day.
Since being here we have been to the Lodge at Amicalola State Park for lunch, Neels Gap, and drove through Blairsville to see the Italian restaurant that the dinner club ate at the night we stayed in the Blood Mountain Cabins. (read my 2015 journal to hear about the dinner club) It is so much fun being so close to the trail knowing that we can go provide trail magic anytime we want too.
We are settling in and I plan on getting back on the trail in June. I am going to do it a little different this time. Mrs. Bean Counter doesn't like to hike or spend the night in a tent but she does want to be part of my adventure so she is going along to support me. I will be mostly slack packing where I can and she has a couple of side trips planned so she won't be there every day. Hopefully we can provide some trail magic also during this time.
My next thing to do is to get all my gear unpacked and arranged to see if I need to replace anything from the 2015 hike. Hopefully not and starting in June the cold weather should be gone so it will be good hiking weather although I know in 2015 it was already some very hot and humid days in between the wet days. I look forward to getting on the trail and meeting some of this year's thru-hikers that I have been following in their trail journals.",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Tue",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563467,"Mrs. Bean Counter reminded me that I forgot to mention the other member of my support team. Ralph will be going along to keep Mrs. Bean Counter company while I am out hiking the trail. Preparation continues for a early June start. Yesterday the weather was very wet so I made it to the basement and started the process of finding all my gear. I think I found it all, just need to decide if there is any gear I want to upgrade. I know I have to get a new pair of trail runners. In 2015 I went through 2 pair of La Sportiva Ultra Raptors and was at the point I needed a new pair when I got off the trail. They were great shoes because I didn't get one blister from wearing them. Almost everyone gets blisters when they first start off but I didn't. The only blister I got was from wearing my crocs in town going to a Burger King for a Whopper. Someone had told me it was only about 1/4 of a mile and it ended up being about 2 miles. So much for people's sense of distance although as I remember it that Whopper sure was good.
When I got off the trail in 2015 I had my hiking legs and could easily hike 20+ miles per day but I will be starting all over trying to go 8-10 miles per day to start with. The folks I will be hiking with will be cranking out the big miles so I will probably meet a lot of folks but they will be leaving me in their dust. 
We are still looking at dates but we will probably leave Georgia heading to Virginia on June 5th or 6th. I didn't plan it this way but I got off the trail on June 5th so starting on June 6th would be like just a continuation of the 2015 hike.
I didn't have a lot to update you on but for my journal to show up on the trail journal web page you need 3 entries. This will be my 3rd entry so now everyone who reads trail journals will see my 2017 journal and can start to follow me. I was amazed at the number of people that followed along in 2015 that I didn't know. They just found me through trail journals.
My next update will be when we get ready to get on the road. Until then wish me luck getting everything ready to go.",,View Entry,"May 07, Sun",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564838,"I hadn't planned on doing any more updates until I got on the trail but we have more definitive plans now so I wanted to go ahead and share them with everyone. It looks like I will get to hike close to 2 months. Cathy and I have worked on our plans and between her supporting me on the trail and visiting our daughter in Oklahoma and visiting other family and friends in Alabama, Louisiana, Virginia, and North Carolina we have the month of June and July pretty much filled in on the calendar. We plan on leaving Georgia on June 1 and getting to Waynesboro Virginia that night and I will get back on the trail at Sawmill Run Overlook at mile marker 95.3 on Skyline Drive the next morning.
While Cathy is supporting me I will be slack packing (for those that don't know what that is Cathy will be dropping me off and picking me up each day and we will stay in a motel). I will only have to carry water, lunch and a few other emergency items daily which will considerably drop the weight I am carrying. When she isn't supporting me I will be back to carrying everything in my backpack and sleeping in my tent or a shelter.
When I got off the trail in 2015 it was time for me to get a new pair of trail runners so I needed to get a new pair to get started. There is an outfitter in Franklin NC that is known for their superior knowledge and service in fitting you in the right pair of hiking shoes. Since Franklin is only about 45 miles from us Mrs. Bean Counter and I drove up one day last week to get me a new pair. The staff were very knowledgeable and got me in a pair of new trail runners that feel great. The name of the outfitter is Outdoor 76. Franklin is a big hiker town where most everyone stops for a night. In 2015 How Far and I decided to go to the Nantahala Mountain Lodge run by ""Wiggy"" vs going to Franklin and I am glad we did. We ended up staying 3 nights due to the snow and cold temps that showed up and it is one of the top 3 hostels that I stayed at. They provided first class service and the hostel is extremely clean which was important to me.
After getting my new trail runners we decided to drive up to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) for lunch since we were so close. I was surprised at the number of thru-hikers that are just now getting to the NOC. Most of these folks left after April 15th, a month later than I started. They were getting ready to make that terrible climb out of the NOC, a 3,000 ft climb.
Not sure if I will have any more updates before I get on the trail but I plan on updating my journal daily and as you know there are times I don't have cell service so I will upload them when I have service.",,View Entry,"May 16, Tue",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567060,"Today was the big day to get moving on this adventure.  We left home about 7 am this morning and headed to Waynesboro Virginia. We made a stop in Charlotte NC to drop off a few things at our good friend Cindy's home. If you have read any of my 2015 pre hiking journals you will know about Bill Crawford who got me back into this backpacking thing. He let me tag along to Wyoming and Montana on a couple of great fishing and backpacking trips. Bill left us way too soon and I can only imagine what type of adventures he would be into if he was still with us. His idea of a great adventure was sailing around the world. (Now that is an adventure) Cindy is Bill's wife and has moved to Charlotte to be closer to her new grandson. We had a short but good visit. Mrs. Bean Counter is planning on going back for a little longer visit on one of her side trips.
We made it to Waynesboro and got checked into the Quality Inn, same place I stayed in 2015. We will stay here for 3 nights while Cathy supports my slack packing. We rode up on Skyline Drive this afternoon and I purchased my lifetime National Park Pass. If you are 62 the lifetime pass is only $10. A 7 day pass cost $25, so a great deal. I also got my backcountry permit while at the Ranger Station. We made our way to the place I got off the trail in 2015 and continued on for about 12 miles so Mrs. Bean Counter could see where she will pick me up tomorrow afternoon.
We made our way back to the Quality Inn and I ran to the new Walmart Community Grocery to pick up a few items for tomorrow and then stop and picked us up some dinner. We have Ralph (our dog) with us so that makes it a little harder to go out to eat unless we leave him in the motel room, which we might do sometimes but didn't figure he would like that his first time in the room.
I can't wait until tomorrow and be able to say I am hiking again. One last interesting fact. We drove about 450 miles from our home in north Georgia to Waynesboro, but I walked almost 900 miles to get to the same place in 2015. Go figure!!",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Thu",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567142,"A little journal housekeeping. My day format is the total days that I have hiked on the AT and the second number is the number of days I have hiked in 2017. I am hoping that I can figure out how to have my total miles hiked to be for the entire trip, 2015 and 2017 but don't know if that is going to be possible.
It couldn't have been a better day to start back on my journey. When I got out of the car this morning it was 58 degrees and never got higher than the low 70's all day. Did I mention that the humidity was almost non-existence? (That's for my Louisiana friends) It felt really good to be back on the trail although I will admit hiking in the park doesn't give you much of any views to see. The trail is great but all the views are reserved for those driving Skyline Drive. There are great overlooks if you are driving and if you haven't done this it is a great ride for about 100 miles. I met a few thru-hikers but most of the hikers I met were just out for the day. I imagine tomorrow will have big crowds since the weather is suppose to be great again.
One of the thru-hikers that I talked to was from Germany and he said he was hiking 25 miles today. It will be a few weeks before I can hike that many miles but I did more miles than I thought I could today. I started out going for about 12 miles but when I got to the place where Mrs. Bean Counter was going to pick me up I was 2 hours early so I called her and we moved the meeting place and I ended up getting close to 15 miles today. I may not be able to walk tomorrow. 
Cathy will slack pack me again tomorrow but on Sunday she will be driving down to Lynchburg to visit a good friend of ours after dropping me off. I will be carrying a full load for a few days and sleeping in my tent.
It happened again today. I was about one mile from my pickup point and I heard something sliding down a tree off to my back on the right. I stopped turned around and there it was, a bear sliding down a tree. My first reaction was to look all around to make sure I wasn't between a mom and her cubs but I didn't see any other bears. I did the normal things, called out to Mr. Bear to let him know I was there and hit my trekking poles together. The next thing I did was to get my camera out since if you remember my bear story from 2015 you know that it was raining and my camera was packed up. I didn't do any better today, by the time I got the camera out Mr. Bear had taken off so no picture again. I will get a picture sooner or later.
If I hadn't seen the bear I wouldn't have seen any wildlife today other than one ground squirrel although Cathy and I have seen a couple deer, a turkey and one rabbit while driving. The deer are suppose to be almost tame in the park and will let you get very close to them but if you don't see them you can't.","Sawmill Run Overlook

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567263,"Started out with another beautiful day here in Virginia. One thing that I didn't do a very good job planning was were we would spend the night each night. I booked a motel room in Waynesboro for 3 nights and that was a mistake. To start with I actually got off the trail further north on Skyline Drive than I remembered and I have hiked a few more miles that I originally planned. So everyday Mrs. Bean Counter and Ralph have been having to drive further and further to drop me off and then to pick me up. By the time they get back to the motel room it's almost time for them to come get me. Today we were able to drive a different road and then get on Skyline Drive further north which sped up the drive just a little. Driving Skyline Drive is a beautiful drive but it's not a road you can make any time on and it seems like forever before you get off. I promised Mrs. Bean Counter I would do a better job planning when she returns from Lynchburg in a couple of days.
As you can see in the picture I passed the 900 mile mark from Springer Mountain in Georgia. I hadn't paid attention to the mileage and didn't realize I would do this today. What a pleasant surprise when I saw the marker on the trail. Today was a little harder hike than yesterday. I'm sure it was because I probably over did it a little yesterday plus there were more ups and downs today than there was yesterday.
I'm not sure what I am going to do tomorrow. It will be my first time carrying my full pack on this trip and have a big climb right at the beginning. In the park they called the shelters huts and they would like AT hikers to stay at the huts or tent sites that are around the huts. The first one I will get to tomorrow is only about 3 miles from my starting spot and the next one is another 12 miles. I don't think I am ready to make that big climb with my full pack and then hike 15 miles. I will see how I feel and may just have to camp somewhere along the way abiding by all the rules here in the park.
I met a girl today who is thru-hiking but her approach is a little different. She is doing a flip-flop (when you start in the middle and usually hike north to Maine and then come back and hike south). What is different about her flip-flop is she started in PA. heading south. That is her home but a little further north as a starting spot and also starting the trip going south but I am sure it will work for her. Her trail name was ""Fern"".
There were not as many day hikers as I though there would be today but there were a lot of thru-hikers who passed me going north. Even at my best hiking it amazes me how fast these young folks can hike up a mountain. I usually have to stop several time to rest and catch my breath and they never slow down, it's if they are walking on flat ground.I am not sure how much cell service I will have the next 2-3 nights since I will be sleeping on the trail but I will update my journal as soon as I have some service.","Doyles River Parking Overlook

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567363,"I made a decision this morning to only hike to the first shelter instead of trying to do 15 miles. I think I made a wise decision. I over did it a little yesterday and needed the afternoon to just rest.
Cathy and I checked out of the motel about 9:30 and I was back on the trail by 11:00. I made it to the shelter by 12:30 and took the afternoon to visit with some thru-hikers that started in Georgia in February and there are some folks just out for a few days. I forgot just how bad thru-hikers can smell. One of the guys I was talking to was pretty ripe. He said his last shower was about 10 days ago. I can't go that long because I know when I can smell myself it's time to get clean any way you can.
Rain is forecasted for the next three days. Just my luck Cathy isn't here to support me and I will be packing up a wet tent and hiking in the rain. I have plenty of experience from 2015 with the rain.
Two guys hiking right in front of me stopped and said they saw a bear but I never could see it. Hopefully one day I will get that picture but if not that's okay. 
The picture is from my new gadget I bought for the trip. I didn't want to bring my iPad mini this year so I found this Bluetooth keyboard that lets me type on my phone. If I had to type of all this on my phone keyboard I probably would not keep a journal. It would just take too long.
Tomorrow will be a 12 mile day to the next hut so hopefully if I get an early start I won't have any problem getting there carrying by pack. There are a couple of climbs but none as bad as the one today.
Not much to report on today but will keep you updated.","Powell Gap

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567775,"The weather forecast was right on the mark today.  I woke up at 5:00 and quickly checked the weather forecast and it said rain would start at 6:00 am. I decided to lay in my sleeping bag until 5:30 and then get up and try to get packed up before the rain started. Just as I had everything in the tent packed I heard the first rain drops hitting the tent and had to get in high gear to try and get the tent down and packed before it got very wet. A wet tent adds a couple of pounds to your pack that you really don't need if you can help it. I got lucky and was packed up when the bottom fell out of the sky. It never let up all day. It wasn't cold but the humility was much higher today. I was wearing my rain jacket but I was sweating inside of it which made me just as wet as if I wasn't wearing anything. You can't take it because it does keep you warm so you just have to deal with being wet.
For someone who was only on the second day carrying a back I had 3 pretty good climbs to make even though they aren't large for someone that has already hiked 900 miles. (They would be a piece of cake to them) It was enough to wear me out even though I only went about 12.4 miles. I was the first one at the shelter and didn't waste anytime getting my tent set up, changed into dry clothes and laying down for about 3 hours before I felt like getting up and cooking something hot to eat. It takes anywhere from 1-2 weeks to get your hikers appetite and until then it can be very hard to eat. (I know that sounds crazy but for me it does work like that) I had to force the pasta side down but I did start to warm up and feel better after getting it down.
After eating it was right back to bed where I stayed until the next morning. It did stop raining but there was a crowd in the hut tonight who was very loud until about 9:00 pm. That's very unusual because the thru-hikers are usually pretty good about cutting off the noise after about 8:00. I never saw this in all my days on the trail in 2015. My tent was about 75 yards away from the hut and it was still pretty loud to me.","Hightop Hut

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567779,"Today was going to be a good day. We had a great weather forecast and I only had about 7 miles to get to the Wayside where Cathy would pick me up and we would go to a motel and she would start supporting me again. I didn't have any big climbs to make so I thought it would be an easy 7 miles but I actually got chilled after sweating just a little bit. This ended up being the longest 7 miles in my life. I did finally see a deer today but she wouldn't stay still enough to get a good shot. As much as I thought today was going to be good it seemed every step was a struggle to make.I finally made it to the Wayside at about 12:00 pm and immediately went in and ordered myself a hamburger and some fries. I again had to forced this down but I had burned so many calories I had to get some in my body. I knew I had about 3 hours to wait on Cathy so I went outside to a picnic table in the sun and stayed there until she got there. While waiting I met a nice husband and wife from Nevada who were thru-hiking the trail. The man hiked the AT in 2011 and then hiked the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail on the West Coast that goes from the Mexico border to the Canadian border). They were both about my age or a little older. Some people are just made for hiking. They gave me their blog address so I can follow along with them.When Cathy got there we jumped in the car and took off to Luray, Virginia to get up a room for the night. As soon as we got in the car I broke the news to her. I was ready to go home. I know you must be thinking how can he quit after only 5 days. I wish I could give you a direct answer but the best I can do is I just don't have it in my heart to keep hiking. To do this long distance hiking your mental state is probably more important than your physical ability to a certain point. I could give you 20 reasons why I am ready to quit but those are the same reasons that everyone has to overcome to be able to make it to Maine from Georgia. Bottom line is I am just ready to go home. Will I say I won't never come back and hike again? No, because I learned long ago to never say never but I can say for now it's time for Cathy and me to take off on our own adventures that we can do together.It's been a joy to share my journal with everyone, it's what has kept me going for 88 days. Thanks for your kind comments and I will continue to share whatever adventures Cathy and I take off on.","Hightop Hut
