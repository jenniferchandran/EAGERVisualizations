EasyDog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/435233,"It has begun. After 5-6 yrs. of secretly wanting & planning an AT thru hike; after close to 2 years of reading TJ; after listening to the grand kids say ""but what if you get hurt, who'll help you?""; I have finally taken the first step in making it happen...my own TJ account and Entry Log.As mentioned in my Profile, I am aware that I may have to postpone one more year, or begin sectioning due to more & more need to help care for aging parents & Father-in Law, (further known as FIL), but you've got to start somewhere if you want to get there.Katahdin, I'll see you sooner than they think!!",, ,"Sep 23, Mon",0
EasyDog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/435310,"Have decided how the finances will work for this, so now I need to work on upgrading most of my camping gear from the usual functional mixture to the necessary lightweight versions. Been camping/backpacking on an ""as time allows"" basis and have what would work, but my God I'd have to take a pack mule!!""Times a wastin"", see ya next time",,View Entry,"Sep 24, Tue",0
EasyDog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/435314,"Over the past two years I've read every book related to the AT that a larger city's library has on the shelf. Then, I began building my own 'library' compiled from a list I keep of any AT related book I see mentioned in articles, etc. Now, I'm focusing particularly on those that relate to me, more specifically, a guy who's reasonably fit, in good health and now, over 60 yrs. young.Am waiting on the delivery of ""Long Distance Hiking on the Appalachian Trail for the Older Adventurer"" by David Ryan......anyone have a review for me on this one?Later.......",,View Entry,"Sep 25, Wed",0
EasyDog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/435396,"As mentioned earlier, wife & I are aiding in the care of my Father-in-Law(FIL) more each week seemingly, as are lots of us nowadays. Last night while taking a break on his porch, wife was talking about FIL's mentioning that he had noticed my helping with things since he returned from rehab and how he felt she was ""lucky"" to have the help. It truly is something that just comes natural and I would expect myself to do, but I added....""guess I'm just trying to earn some AT Brownie Points!!She still says that she & her best friend are going to help with as many of my re-supply stops as they can up the trail.....using them as their own ""Road Trip"" excuses.Sounds super to me, two great women waiting as I come out of the woods!! Can't ask for better encouragement to keep pushing to the next resupply.Later......EasyDog","

EasyDog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/435739,"A 'journal-reading opinion':When reading other aspiring thru-hikers' journals, NOT, by the way any of the Class of 2015, it seems I have begun mentally making bets on who will not finish.I'm constantly amazed at those who are touting their use of high-tech, as well as high priced, equipment & gadgets......for instance, the use of GPS location-finders mounted on their packs so that they can be traced every second by their spouses; can hit a button (help I've fallen and can't get up) for help; show exactly when & where they even take a break for God's sake!!These folks just need to have a forum to brag, or show their doubting Significant Other that they can be watched even on the AT!! Not jealous of their ability to purchase & use the latest 'stuff', just don't believe they realize that they can't buy what it takes to be a thru hiker, and their SO's really won't/can't leave the 'control' factor out of the equation.Simply my opinion, no damage intended......I've been married for 41 years and the main ingredient is trust, not control.....Later, EasyDog","
