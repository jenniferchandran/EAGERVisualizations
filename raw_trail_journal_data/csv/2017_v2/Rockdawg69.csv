Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579110,"Once More Into  The Breach!  No training, no prep, just Do It!
Provided Mother Nature keeps the hurricanes away this time, I will be hiking the hallowed hills and byways of Stonewall's legendary Foot Calvary: Harper's Ferry, through the Gaps, Front Royal, down thru the Shenandoah Park to Waynesboro and finally to Montebello/Tye River crossing.  There may be some short side trips for a battlefield visit. 
This will complete all of Virginia, leaving me a gap of Maryland and Pennsylvania for next spring and a final jump to Great Barrington, MA for the last leg.  Lots of ""ifs"", ""ands"", and ""buts"" between here and there.
Edit: Oct 31.As you read this journal you will find that I did not make it the last 30 miles to the Tye River crossing due to stupidity on my part. Forgetfulness happens when you are focused on the immediate action you are about to take.This means I did not complete the VA section. Looks like I will be back next year at some point to finish the 30 mile section.",,Home,"Oct 05, Thu",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579258,"We lucked out for a change. Hurricane Nate missed us but we did get some rain and winds.  Nothing special this time.  
All the stuff has been gone thru 3 times, drop box ready for mailing to Front Royal, boots checked and ready, tickets for Amtrak purchased, double checked my brother for ride to train station midnight Tuesday night, and made reservations at Tea Horse hostel in Harper's Ferry for Wednesday evening.  Maybe I have everything ready and then again there is probably something missing from the pack.",,Home,"Oct 08, Sun",0

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580125,"Well Amtrak started the trip like usual - late. Savannah boarding was an hour and 15 minutes late - 0105 to 0220. We eventually got back on schedule. Why is this important? I only had a 40 minute window for next connection in DC. Somewhere south of Petersburg, VA we sat for 40 minutes. From 20 minutes ahead to 20 minutes behind schedule. We eventually got to DC with 20 minutes to spare. Needless to say, I was running to the next train. Took directions from a Red Cap service agent that turned out to be ""incorrect"". Turned where he said, but that failed to take me thru a gate. Was severely reprimanded by an Amtrak lady. She eventually let me thru after satisfying herself that I had been brow beaten enough. Made the train with 5 minutes to spare. Got to Harper's at 1745 to find light rain falling. Headed uphill to find the hostel a mile away. New AT hiker, Corey, finds his way there also. Two thru hikers there on a zero day, plus 2 guys doing a bike ride of the C& O Canal path from Pittsburgh to DC were also in. Good nights rest.","Savannah, GA

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579590,"Good night at the Tea Horse. Great breakfast of waffles and juice. Recommend this hostel if you are in Harper's Ferry. Finally started Blue blaze trail from ATC hedquarters at 0830. This hopes to be a trip that finishes WV and VA sections - southbound. Need to get to Tye River crossing to complete the trip.
Ahhhh! The joy of being in the fall woods again. The rat-a-tat-tat of acorns falling, the thump of hickory nuts passing your head, the ka-whomp of walnuts hitting the trail, and lastly, the cracking and crashing of Widow-makers hitting where you were standing 30 seconds earlier. In this case, an entire tree.Overcast and misty most all day making the hiking pleasurable. Cool and breezy helped. Met a tour group of ""senior folks"" with a guide doing a walk on the trail. Called themselves Road Scholars for which I mistook for ""Rhodes Scholars"". My mistake. They were doing four states along the AT in short day hikes - VA, MD, PA and lastly, WV (today). According to the guide this used to be called ""Elderhostel"", which apparently is now "" passe'. Mostly ladies in 60's and a couple of gentlemen. I think I had my picture taken a few times - dirty old hiker trash - for their future funny stories.The climb out of the Shenandoah River valley was slow but not overly taxing for my first day. Found a couple of spots that I believe were War Berween The States cannon emplacements (Confederate) on Loudon Heights before I got to the top. Old roads serviced this area, mostly wagon tracks more than a road. The ridge is crowned by quartzite and is strewn with rock gardens thru which the trail always navigates. Never miss a chance to go over or thru rocks is the current philosophy.Stopped at David Lessor shelter and then moved to Blackburn Center at 1630. Cory- first time AT hiker- made it in at 1730. For a hiker cabin, the wood stove was a welcome addition as temps were dropping. However the wooden bunks with no mats were not a pleasant end to the day. I left my Neo Air home to cut out a few more ounces. ouch!
No major events today, thankfully. Did see a yearling doe and heard a hen turkey during the hike.Not a bad day for first day out and being an old dawg!","Tea Horse Hostel, Harper's

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579596,"Cool and misty, with breezes again. Managed to struggle out of Blackburn at 0900. They do not tell you it is 150 feet almost straight down/up to get in and out of this spot. 
Fog and mists kept things cool. Also allowed for quiet walking, which led to finding 2 small bucks locking horns and playing next to the trail. A couple of grunts and they decided to head downhill. 30 yards up the trail were a doe and yearling eating apples that fell in the trail. Flags up and they were gone also.Good trail until after lunch when I hit the Roller Coaster ( 13.5 miles of ups and downs). Reminds me of the 30 miles in GA before getting to NC. These are knee killer hills, even though they are not that high, just straight up and straight down for the most part - no switchbacks or side hill tracing. Just about killed me!Long, tough day for the old dawg.Reached Sam Moore about 1600. Another hiker my age came in later, Robert from Ohio. Cory made in even later.","Blackburn Trail Center

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579597,"A restless night with little sleep. Not sure why but guessing it was that hard wooden bunk with no padding. It came into play immediately once I started back on the Roller Coaster. No energy, no legs, and no lungs. Started to wonder if I was having a minor AFIB event. Took extra meds per Doc's orders just in case. Much better after lunch. Lots of day and weekend hikers on this Saturday. Also some section hikers.Cool and cloudy again with temps in 60s. At least I was cool, but soaking wet as usual from the ""work"".
Found a young doe eating acorns after lunch. She just stepped off the trail and kept eating as I walked by. Could hear her thinking - dumb humans, out walking these hills!Made Rod Hollow at 1600, early enough to do all the necessary stuff without a rush before dark. Robert checked in an hour later, right on schedule according to him - speed 1 mile per hour.","Sam Moore Shelter

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579621,"Overcast again this morning. Left for Dick's Dome Shelter at 0830. Expecting two long climbs today and was not disappointed. However, I seem to be getting better at climbing. Legs and lungs are getting stronger. Trail is much better thru these sections, with better grades and switchbacks that help the effort.Told Robert I was heading to the Dome and would see him there. However, I arrived there at 1330, 8.3 miles in 5 hours, much faster than I anticipated. Weather cleared to some extent so I decided to push on to Manasas Gap shelter. Did not leave a message for Robert, as he knows I am moving faster now. Arrived at Manasas Gap around 1630. North bound hiker from Germany came in a little later. His visa expires in another month so he will only get into PA a ways before he has to leave the country. Thinks he will come back in a couple of years to finish the trail.Called home and reported that I was still on schedule and trying for Front Royal for Monday night.
Awoke to rain around midnight. Where did that come from as it was clear to the west when I went to bed. Rain was accompanied y high winds most of the night. Things going crack and bump in the night - not animals!!","Rod Hollow Shelter

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579623,"Awoke to wet stuff around the camp site. Last night I had to string the hammock in a pair of trees that were a little too close together for optimal hanging. The tarp was stretched tight but the mists/fog got underneath anyway. I put the tarp away wet and hammock was damp from humidity. Temp definitely dropped and winds continued all day. Wind chill was a factor until around1400.Met a group of ladies doing day hikes from Chester Gap to Harper's Ferry. Told them they would enjoy the Roller Coaster --- with a grin!! Whatever, they were having a good time. Would not be any bears anywhere around with that group laughing and talking as they hiked. Probably no other animals either.Calf muscle or ligament was killing me by the time I topped out on the last climb. Will need rest in Front Royal to let it heal some.Reached US 522 at Chester Gap around 1500. Called a Yellow Cab and hit Post Office and then motel. Nice long hot, soaking bath for the hurting muscle and the rest of me. Hiker smell killed for a while, except for clothes. Washing them tomorrow.Caught up on calls to home and FaceTime to grandson, as well as journal needs.","Manasas Gap Shelter

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579628,"A day of rest. Helping the calf muscle and other minor pains.Got my clothes done, foot care items, mail, and journal caught up to date. I picked up a new canister of butane/propane mix for my backpack stove and a long sleeve thin shirt from Stoke's General Store on Main Street. Good place for ""stuff"". I don't know how they got all that stuff in the store but it seems to go on forever. Recommended stop for necessary items except food. Classic, old style general store.
Good hot meals and extra rest today. It will be needed for tomorrow. Looks like about a 2000 foot climb to second hut, if I can get that far. Also looks like water may be a big issue on this end of the Shenandoah park. Dry weather and long distances between any viable springs. I hate carrying extra water but may be forced to have 1 more liter in some areas.At least weather is looking good for next few days.","Front Royal

Clear weather.Passed 4 does this morning on first climb. They do not care that you are here. Stand there and look at you, wondering why you interrupted their breakfast.Travel time improved. Reached Gravel Springs hut at 1630. Four southbounders arrived- Juipter Giant, Good House Keeping, Phoenix, and last but not least, Santa Claus, also known as Just Bob. He came in at 2000 with bells a jingling and lights a flashingWatched a half-grown bear cub ramble through the rocks down from the shelter while we finished eating. Small buck came and drank from the spring 50 feet from shelter while we ate. Santa's deer roamed around all night keeping me awake for a while.

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579962,"Got out of Gravel Springs by 0830 for 4 long climbs today. Weather was great again today.First climb not so bad, second climb was a butt kicker. Made Elk Wallow wayside on Skyline Drive by 1200. Everyone from last night was already there eating. Gatorade and blueberry pie was lunch. Third climb after lunch was also a butt kicker. Wondering when I will get legs and lungs. Last climb at 1500 was not as bad but a lady in her 60s left ahead by a few minutes and beat me to the top and she had a knee replacement last year. Pretty well beat out by then. Finaly got a phone signal after 3 days, checked in at home nothing to report on that front.Made Pass Mtn hut at 1645. No water here. Met Randolph from Warrenton, VA. About my age. Good conversation for a while. About 1800 an 8 a point buck walked up within 30 feet of the hut and looked around as if to ask - what the heck are y'all doing here? Then walked on looking for acorns, etc.","Gravel Springs Hut

Stopped and camped off-trail near TimberHollow Overlook on Skyline Drive. Left Pass Mtn hut at 0830, crossed Thornton Gap and got water at the Pananorama parking area rest rooms.
Mary's Rock climb was a challenge - 1200 feet. Met and/or was passed by several day-hikers going up to the ""rock"". On top, wind was blowing like a banshee - 30 to 40 knots. Took pics and got off the ledge. Moved on to the Pinnicle Rock (another 700 feet) and down to the Pinnicle picnic area for more water. Tackled Stoney Man Mountain next ( 800 feet). Down to Skyland Resort and more water at the stable area at 1600. Getting late and knew I would not make Hawksbill Hut. Finally hunkered down at 1700 near Timber Hollow Overlook. In the sack by 1800 and listening to cars on the Skyline until 2200. Sleep was not easy coming. Hoping for better travel day tomorrow.

Saturday on the Skyline in the fall - a million folks here. Got lunch and and some resupply. Spent 2 hours doing this stuff. Finally got moving again at 1430.Pushed hard to get past Hazel Top Mtn (another 500 feet) and then Bear Fence Mtn (300).

Took a rest before the High Top climb, got water and left at 1430. Struggled up those rocks until reaching an overlook rock pile at 1600. Got few pics out into Shenandoah Valley and the rock pile. Windy again up this high, but not as cold as previous tops earlier last week.Booked out for High Top Hut after calling home to check in. Got there at 1630 to find Just Bob already there. Steep down hill to water at a spring but at least there is water here. Did all the necessary things just in time to beat the wind storm. Winds, fog, clouds, mist start the night and then the occasional drizzle started. Everything under my tarp got damp from the mess. Looks like rain tomorrow.","Bear Fence Hut

WHAT A Wonderful start to the day. Temps were upper 50's. Just Bob and I sat around waiting for some clearing that did not happen until 1130. At least enough to see a bear coming down the trail so that you could get out of the way!Finally had to go, so we booked down the mountain to Simmon's Gap Ranger Station for more water. Got there at 1500, rain starts falling at 1505. Whoooopee!Climbed out of Simmon's Gap in the rain for about 700 feet. What a thrill ( stop whining, you asked for this).Made it to Pinefield at 1630 to find Phoenix there already. She passed us while we at ranger station.Dropped everything in hut and changed out of wet clothes. Sleeping on hard wood hut floor tonight since I did not bring a sleeping pad (dumb). Laid out everything I had on the upper tier and tried to make the wood as comfortable as I could (Ha Ha). A northbound hiker - Omega - came in at 1830. Did not stop talking until 2030.

Did a couple of 700 footers including Loft Mtn before getting to store at 1230. Food - yeah!. Washed clothes and dried all my hammock gear on the grass behind the store. Hot lunch of pasta and chicken. Stocked up for next 3 days to Waynesboro. Phoenix came and went on to Black Rock Hut at 1400. Too far for me to go this late and there is no water at that hut. Paid the fee for the campground and sacked in at 1800 to watch a beautiful sunset.

Wind got me while packing my stuff. Tarp was flying around and a guy line hooked a loop on my boot throwing me to the ground like roping a wild steer, then tried to hog tie me to the ground. Something stuck my nose as I hit the ground. It took almost and hour to stop the blood flow from front of the old nose. Painted it with Blistix and got ready to stumble on down the path.The rest of the day was a great trail and pleasant, easy hike for a change.  Left the campground at 1030 and reached Black Rock Mtn view point at 1400. One giant pile of boulders with a good trail around the base. Nice picture area. Turned on iPad and talked with wife on FaceTime so she could see the valley, mountains and fall colors. No need to show her the rocks !Reached the hut about 1500.Seven folks eventually came in. Jason was out trying some new gear. He headed back to his car since there was no water. As two more came in he agreed to get his car and they would go to Loft store for water. They all came back with 6 to 8 liters. Issac and Tim came in then Skittles (lady) and Dan ( as old as me).

Long grades and flats. Prepared for the bear on Wildcat Ridge that everyone said was there. As usual, I don't get to see ""the"" bear. Must have been too cold for him this morning.Travel times were really good as I made the 13 miles by 1500. Skittles was already in and set up. She does not socialize very much, mostly stays in her tent. Issac and Tim rolled in about 1630 heading back to their vehicle at Rockfish Gap early Friday morning. Talked with them for a while. A little later another couple rolled in and set up their tent. The guy wanted to empty his liquor bottles so he could get water. I gave home my empty. Bad decision as he got drunk and talked until well after midnight. Not sure how his lady friend/ significant other was able to suffer through that.Down to one set of breakfast meals left after tonight's dinner. Waynesboro tomorrow - finally.

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580040,"Clear and cool morning. Temps in the 40's for a change. Reached 60's by noon.Since this was a short hike, I waited until 0930 to start as I could not check in at the motel until after 1430. There were a couple of small ups and many downs today. Good views from Little Calf Mtn summit. The final set of downs was a rock scramble around many side hills. Rough walking and slower than I like, but there was no need to break something on those sections. Slow and steady wins this operation.

Reached Rockfish Gap ( US Hwy 250/ I - 64) junction at 1400. Picked some names from a list of free shuttle drivers. Got lucky with first call to ""The Southerner"", Mr. Brown. He had lived in GA 5 times through the years. A real southern gentleman. Took me all over town to show me where everything was located, to include picking up my box at the P. O. and then to the motel. Checked in at 1445, got my first shower in a few days and went to wash clothes and pick up next food supply.Called home and found out I had forgotten to renew the tag on the TN truck. It will expire Oct 31 - Oh heck!!!! Stronger words are appropriate but not here.
So a decision was made to schedule a shuttle to Amtrak as near as possible to Waynesboro and get home ASAP. Found shuttle with Dubose ""Yellow Truck"" Egleston here. He suggested Charlottesville, VA as closest station. Arranged for picked up on tomorrow at 1115. Made hotel reservations in Charlottesville, as train departs for DC at 0709 everyday. Made Amtrak reservations for Sunday with arrival back in Savannah at 2100 Sunday night. Confirmed all this junk with the wife.
As an aside, it turns out this was a good decision. There was little to no water over the next 30 miles to the Tye River crossing near Montebello. Also, heavy storms and deep cold are due Saturday night and Sunday morning. Not the best of conditions for high mountain hiking with about 3000 feet of total climbing over the first 2 days from Rockfish Gap.","Calf Mountain Hut

It took 30 minutes in line. Would have thought it was Christmas mailing season with all those folks mailing boxes today. Yellow Truck said he thought they might have arrested me for mailing something not allowed. Dang lines.

Got to the Holiday Inn and was told to come back at 1330 as rooms were not ready.

Went for lunch and found a new L L Bean store one block away. Yeah!! Spend more money. I did buy a new fleece jacket as the one taken to the trail was getting ragged. Lunched at a place called Burger Bach. I can recommend that establishment highly. Great burgers and many varieties of liquid refreshment to choose from.
And to end the day - a great bashing of those nasty Gator folks. GO DAWGS!!!!!!!!!

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580070,"After all the issues with Amtrak today, I think I will stick with driving from now on. At least I can find shuttles that will get me back snd forth to the trail or truck.  There were also issues with late Amtrak travels on previous trips.
First thing today, Amtrak was delayed 4 hours in Charlottesville. I was re-routed to DC for a 1505 departure. New connection now delayed unknown amount of time. Would have been home at 0300, now, who knows.

Now for trail summary: This was still a bear to walk with no previous practice for the mountain work ahead. Some struggles with legs and lungs as usual for me. As I was finishing, everything started to come together after 2 weeks. Again as usual for me.Initial section from Harper's Ferry had lots of rock and rock gardens. Rough on the boots and feet. You have to watch each step to miss a rock or risk a twisted ankle at least. Surprisingly, I moved through without any issues other than being tired at end of the day. I did strain a muscle or ligament somewhere around the 3rd day. Probably pushing too hard in the Roller Coaster section. A zero day at Front Royal helped tremendously to ease that issue.

Gaps are still a problem for me, especially in these mountains. Always a steep rise coming out of the gap. My solution has been - do a little, rest, do a little. Slow, but I eventually will get there, at least so far in these last few hikes. By the 13/14th day, the climbs were getting much easier, with less stops to rest. ""I Hate Those Day Hikers"". No weight, no timeframe, no cares!So much for the whining!

Lessons learned - again! Hammocks are a blessing; Remember to take a light weight sleeping pad for going to ground (wood floors are hard); slow down and enjoy the trail; be prepared to change your plan anytime; Get Pack Weight Down Some More. Twenty-nine pounds (5 days food) is still toooooo muuuccchhh!

New Zimmer pack did well for the first time out. I think it is a bit small for 5 day runs. Pretty full with that much food and gear. 3 to 4 days would be better. But at 2.5 lbs for the pack, it would be hard to add back the approx. 2 additional lbs for the ULA Catalyst pack. Looks like another round of downsizing for the gear. This pack would do well for summer weather as I could cut a couple of bulky pieces ,or about 2 lbs worth.
More thoughts later.
