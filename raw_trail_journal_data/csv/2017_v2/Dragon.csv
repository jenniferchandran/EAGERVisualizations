Dragon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520457,"Commence Operation Dragon DanceToday marks the official start (and naming) of Operation Dragon Dance.Over the summer the brilliant, insane, and exciting idea of hiking the Appalachian Trial presented itself to me. As brilliant, insane, and exciting are three words that I would very much like to describe my own life, I was immediately smitten with the idea. I was so taken with the prospect that I decided to do absolutely nothing for several months out of fear that this was a temporary infatuation that was getting all my hormones going like an inexperienced teenager and that if it never matured into a long term commitment, I'd be left looking foolish and I'd possibly be out several thousands of dollars. I meant to wait until March before starting my research and preparation, but, like most of us who fall in love, I couldn't contain myself and decided to move a bit faster than I originally planned. The motivating factor, or excuse if you prefer, is that I want to be out doing practice hikes in March. I live within reasonable driving distance to Shenandoah Nation Park and hike there on a regular basis. I'm a strong hiker and normally go out for 4 to 5 hours in a go and hike about 10 miles. That's unencumbered besides a small pack with food and water which is sometimes carried by me and at other times carried my partner, hiking and otherwise, who has yet to decide on a code name for this wonderful operation and therefore shall simply be called NoCode until he decides on something cooler. Of course, he might be permanently stuck with NoCode if he waits too long and I grow fond of it. To practice hike for the AT, I want to go for much farther distances and I want to carry more weight. In order to do this, ideally I need the pack that I'll be carrying when I do my thru hike.Yesterday, I did a whole lot of reading on packs. Today, I went to REI and after trying on a pack that was commonly used and recommended by people online, the Osprey Eos 58 in case you were wondering, I threw out all my research and got a totally different pack because it felt 1000 times more comfortable. I bought the Deuter ACT Lite 60 + 10 LS. It's a pound heavier than what I really wanted but if the Osprey Eos made carrying 20 lbs of weight feel like 20 lbs, the Deuter made it feel like 12 lbs. If a pack can make weight your carrying feel more than 25% lighter, an extra pound for comfort is more than justifiable to me. Plus the employee who sold it to me said they had a woman who worked there that had done a thru hike of the AT with the same type of pack and was very happy with it.Thus Operation Dragon Dance has started. It's official commencement was celebrated afterwards with a Dragon Roll at my favorite local sushi restaurant.",,Operation Dragon Dance,"Jan 30, Sat",0
Dragon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521577,"This winter has been unusually mild in Northern Virginia. It's normally freezing cold in the area between mid-December and mid-March. I've had issues in the past being able to stay warm during the winter. It's as if the cold out my front door seeps deep under my skin so that no matter how warm it is inside I still feel permanently chilled. I haven't had that problem this year. My only concern about the mild weather is the well being of certain plants I have growing in my yard. I don't know how long it needs to be cold or how cold it needs to get in order for my perennials to go into dormancy or how important it is that they do. Yard work and gardening are relatively new hobbies for me. While the warmer weather might not be good for my tulips, it has given me an opportunity to exercise one of my favorite vices- impatience. I had planned my first hike for March 5 this year. With a 70 degree, sunny Saturday on February 20, I couldn't pass up to chance to start two weeks early.NoCode and I started hiking in Shenandoah National Park last year. It was something that I had done a few times before and had enjoyed. After completing a couple hikes and realizing it was something he could enjoy too, I suggested that we hike the ENTIRE 500+ miles of trail in the park. A year ago, 500 miles over the course of years seemed an ambitious goal. I can't fathom the level of insanity that I must have achieved in the last year to make over 2,100 miles in less than a year seem like an appropriate challenge. Even with realizing how crazy the idea is, I still am happy with my decision. I probably like the idea because part of me does think it's crazy. I like to push my limits and undertake unconventional projects. In other words, crazy, insane, and weird are terms that I believe to be compliments. We were both excited to get back outside and hike. We had new toys to play with. NoCode purchased a set of trekking poles around the same time I bought my Deuter pack. Saturday morning, I loaded my pack with food, water, a few large textbooks for weight, and a pillow for volume. I had a vague memory of what the pack felt like with 20 lbs in it at REI and I estimated that I was carrying about 15 lbs. We decided to hike Jenkins Gap and a 1.6 mile section of the AT for a total round trip of 6.6 miles including a short entrance trail.Jenkins Gap was a monster of a trail to start with considering it was our first time out after months of not hiking and I was carrying a pack for the first time. I've always been the type of person who prefers to dive in head first. Jenkins Gap is a 1.6 mile trail which loses about 1,700 feet from where it meets the AT to where it exits the park. A majority of that elevation change seems to happen in the first three quarters of the trail. It was a gorgeous trail though. There were multiple stream crossings, moss covered rocks, and frequent views of the farmland in the mountain valley. I have never heard Jenkins Gap recommended for a hike but there are many commonly recommended hikes in Shenandoah that are not half as worthwhile. It has been one of my favorite hikes in the park thus far. The section of the AT that we hiked would have be somewhat unremarkable if it hadn't been for the snow. I had never hiked in the snow before and at first I thought it would be fun. I couldn't have been more wrong. If you've ever tried to run across a dry beach, you know how the sand slips under your feet and makes getting anywhere more difficult. I now know that snow has a similar effect. Hiking up the initial 1,000 ft elevation change over 1 mile covered in several inches of snow almost the entire way was exhausting. After the first quarter mile, I was cursing the snow and myself for ever thinking that it was going to be fun. After that mile, the trail mostly leveled out although it experienced a slight decline. Less than a quarter of a mile from where the AT crossed Sky Line Drive, the backbone of the park and where we turned around, was the foundation of a building and a pit which appeared to have once been a man made pond. Sitting on the old foundation we took our official lunch break.Overall we did 6.6 miles in about 4 1/4 hours which included the multiple breaks we took for food and water. NoCode and I were both satisfied with our performances on our first hike of the year. My toes have problems blistering, specifically between the toes where they rub against each other. It's something that happens if I go jogging after I haven't been for several months or when I hike. I only had this happen on one toe which is a considerable improvement over my hikes last year. If it wasn't for my toe, I would say that I could have hiked at least another 5 miles without a problem. I'm hoping regular hiking will toughen my feet enough so I don't have as many issues during my thru hike.If I was at all disappointed with myself or the hike, it would be because I over estimated the length of the hike when I was looking at the map. I was hoping it would be closer to 8 miles long. I would also have liked to have kept a quicker pace. The goal in my mind was 2 mph but I have a tendency to have unrealistically high expectations for myself. That feeling of disappointment was replaced by pride this morning when I weighed my pack. The pack that I thought was 15 lbs was very close to being 30 lbs. I hiked 6.6 miles, over notable elevation, at a reasonable pace while carrying almost 30 lbs!I'm looking forward to improving and training and preparing. With this as my starting point of physical condition, I think I will be able to have an impressive attempt at a thru hike next year.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Mon",6.60
Dragon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522523,"When I was a child old enough to understand it, my mother would tell me a joke on this day every year. She would say, “Today is my favorite holiday.” For the first few years, I was confused and I’d look at her and ask her what holiday it was. She would reply, “It’s Command Day- March Fo(u)rth!” By middle school, I knew that March 4 was my mother’s favorite holiday and by high school, I was telling everyone in my class the joke. I love my mom. She taught me invaluable lessons about hard work, equality, and respect. She’s a strong woman whom I’ve never heard whine and I’ve only seen cry maybe twice. She doesn’t shy away from manual labor or getting dirty if that’s what it takes to get the job done. She will work long hours, take on extra work, and carry not only her own weight but the weight of the entire team. She values practicality over beauty and will chose a comfortable outfit that will get the job done without any consideration to if it looks good on her. She treats everyone with respect. She tries to see every possible side of an argument because she is invested in understand where other people are coming from. She doesn’t gossip or speak poorly of others. She’s an intelligent, strong, loving person whose main concern in life is her children’s happiness. If I amount to half the person she is, I will be a person I can be more than proud to be. My start date for my hike is my mom’s favorite holiday. It’s a subtle tribute to her part in my life’s journey this far and an acknowledgment of her contribution in making me the type of person who would take on such a challenge. I’m sure the relevance and symbolism to my start date will be lost on most of those who are close enough to me to know that it’s my mom’s favorite holiday. It’s also the first Saturday of March in 2017, so I’m sure many people will assume that has more to do with it than the specific date. I don’t even expect my mom to know that I’ve chosen the date because of her unless I share that information with her. Even she will likely think it to be a coincidence. It’s most important that I know why that’s my start date. I will know when I take my first steps on the trail in Georgia that it is my mother’s eldest daughter who is starting the journey with my mom’s lessons, strength, and determination to accompany me along the way. I am setting out to discover more about who I am and maybe even to become a different person but so much of what I’ll always be and of who will be taking those first steps owes its existence to the amazing person who loved, provided, and a taught me those early life lessons with strength, sacrifice, and unending patience. Enjoy Command Day. March forth!",,Command Day,"Mar 04, Fri",0
Dragon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531926,"The last two months have been busy for me. I have a few projects going right now besides planning for the AT. They’re things that I don’t want to talk about much here. I want the primary focus of this journal to be my hike and not everything else I have going on in my life. Since it’s relevant to the hike, I will say that a large amount of my time in the last few months has gone to using Java to code a computer program to plan a thru hike. I’ve spent the last year teaching myself Java and have been looking to take on projects to help me learn more about the computer language through experience. If I get to count making that program as preparation for the hike (which I really shouldn’t since if all that coding time could have been used to actually hand write a plan, I’d probably have a plan already worked out), then a majority of my time has been spent on preparing for my hike. I program; I practice; I research; I shop. I also spend a lot of time dealing with questions from relatives who are convinced that hiking alone might as well be as dangerous as going into a war zone.Thursday I hike. Not every Thursday though. NoCode and I are still occasionally going hiking together about once a month on Saturdays, so I’ll skip a Thursday if I know I’ll be out there on Saturday. I’m averaging about 12.5 miles a hike with an elevation gain/loss of 2,000 ft or so. I’m not sure exactly how to think about the elevation change though. If you wanted to count every gain of 10ft even if it was immediately followed by a loss of 10ft, FitBit gives me between 250 to 300 floors (2,500 to 3,000ft). The net elevation change between my highest and lowest points isn’t nearly that much; looking at it that way, it’s closer to 1,500 to 2,000 ft. I don’t consider it extreme but I am going out of my way most hikes to pick up extra elevation shifts. I’ve purchased or borrowed stuff for hiking in the cold and rain. I’m now excited when it’s raining on a Thursday because I like testing my set up. I’m looking forward to this coming winter for the same reason. I still have a lot of stuff to buy which has led me to realize something about myself- I’m a horrible person who is going to buy a lot of equipment at REI instead of smaller and probably better companies that specifically specialize in quality hiking gear. Part of the reason is because I like going into a physical store to look at stuff before purchasing it. That desire changes from a preference to a requirement when I’m buying clothing or shoes. Another part of the reason for this is because I’m lazy when it comes to doing research. I like to learn what works and what doesn’t work by trying to use it. To find these companies and good products requires me to spend time searching through forums and articles online. If I go to REI, I can browse and pick stuff that looks like it’ll work. The notable exception to this is my camping set up. I met a guy about a year ago who told me about camping in a hammock which sounded like heaven. I don’t sleep well in a bed to begin with and I love napping in hammocks whenever I get the chance. So in March I spent hours absorbing as much information as I could from the internet about hammock camping. I now own the Blackbird by Warbonnet along with their tarp, the Superfly. I haven’t set it up outside yet, but it was hanging between two columns in my living room for a few days. In a couple months I’m thinking about doing some overnight hikes with that. I still need an underquilt and/or pad to go with it. That’s going to require a bit more research which is probably why it isn’t done yet.",,Practice and Planning,"May 06, Fri",0
Dragon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558888,"March 4 has come and gone but I have not set forth on my adventure. Sometime late last summer after doing research on hiking the trail and ways to go about it, I became intrigued by the idea of a south bound hike. There are a few reasons why the idea appealed to me. All but one of those reasons are related to it being a less chosen route than the north bound hike. The south bound course is often thought to be the more difficult choice. While north bound hikers need to cover the same ground, the order in which a hiker faces challenges can influence the perceived difficulty. The northern part is often considered to be the most challenging part of the hike because of the steep elevation and the 100 mile wilderness. A south bound hiker faces the 100 mile wilderness within days of starting the hike while a north bounder will face it at the very end after training and being conditioned for it by the 2,000 mile hike leading up to it. If any part of me agrees that a south bound hike is more difficult, I would find it hard to forgive myself for taking the easier path. I also like the idea of facing the most trying parts of the trail first. I’m fostering the hope that being miserable in a bug infested swamp for 100 miles at the beginning will give me something to look back on later in the hike to put my misery into perspective. The idea being that if I’ve made it through the worst of it, I can find the strength to continue. I would assume the road less traveled appeals to many thru hikers. If it didn’t, why would we elect to spend nearly half a year in the woods instead of on a crowded beach? I understand that there tends to be a sense of community between thru hikers which comes from everyone having the same goals and being insane enough to attempt such an ambitious project. At the same time, I am not a social person by nature. Starting in Georgia surrounded by people and struggling to find room in overcrowded shelters does not appeal to me. I know I will be hiking south along with hundreds of other people this year and I look forward to meeting them and maybe feeling that sense of community and connection. If I was to hike northward though, I’d be hiking north with thousands of others. If hiking south reduces the number of my social group by a power of ten, it is the choice for me. There are other reasons why the less popular choice is appealing but they are secondary in my mind. They include environmental impact, spread of disease, and being a wannabe hipster. The primary reason however is most defiantly less people for the sake of less people.Being a south bounder means my start date needed to be pushed back until Baxter State Park will allow me to climb Mt Katahdin. The earliest date for that is typically June 1 and so that is when I intend to start. If I get there and they won’t let hikers climb it yet, I’ll have to wait around until they do because Virginia is too far away from Maine to be considered a day trip.I have less than two months now. I’m finalizing my gear selection and trying to hike more and spend more nights out in the woods figuring out what works and what doesn’t. I’m still learning things every time I go out. I have chosen a hammock setup for camping and there is a bit of a learning curve where hammocks are concerned. I sleep better in a hammock than I do in even a bed let alone the ground. Getting as much rest as possible between strenuous days is something that I foresee being incredibly important for me. I’d rather look forward to sleep than dread a restless night that leaves me in more pain than when I laid down. In other words, it’s worth it to me to put in the effort to learn what I need and how to set up for hammocking camping.I’m excited and nervous. I remember learning that many people who plan a hike like this feel time doesn’t move fast enough in the beginning because they are so excited about setting out Then when it starts getting closer to the start date they report feeling like time is moving too fast, and they keep thinking of more stuff they need. Even knowing this, the same thing has happened to me. A year ago, I thought I had plenty of time and I was worried that I’d buy everything in the first few months and then be bored by the wait. Now I feel like I should have done more with that initial excited drive I had because I could plan and train for another year and still not feel like I was truly ready. That’s the nervous part of the wait for me. I don’t know if I’ll be ready or if there’s anything more I can really do to be ready. It’s like waiting for a test that I’ve studied for but knowing there’s a chance that the questions are going to be on everything that I thought was too obscure to be testable or even worse that the paper will land in front of me and my mind will go blank, so I keep looking back over my notes wondering what I’m missing. I’m excited too but I don’t expect that to fully overcome the nervousness until I’m out there with my pack doing it. I’m good at hiking. I like hiking. Once I’m putting miles under my shoes and behind my back, I fully expect excitement to accompany the feeling of self-satisfaction I always get from covering ground.",,Changing Directions,"Apr 05, Wed",0

I thought I was making good time even though I was exhausted until I passed a sign for Cooper Pond which I thought I'd passed 3 miles ago. It meant that instead of having walked 6 miles since my last break, it was only 3, and instead of 3 more miles to camp, it was 6. I became so discouraged and my feet hurt so bad. I just feel down in the woods and considered taking a nap leaning against my pack. I was hoping to break at the road, 3 miles to camp but decided I wasn't going to make it that far without a break. A group passed me while I was sitting there and asked if I was alright. I said I was exhausted but not hurt. I got up as they were passing and not 3 minutes later, I hit the road. It was like a miracle. I was so relieved. One of the guys who passed me was a Swiss guy with the Trail name Mary Poppins. He's really great- he loves the Trail name because it makes people smile.

Bugs was at the campsite I stayed at hiding in his tent from the bugs, which were horrendous. There was also an older gentlemen there who seemed familiar with the area.

It makes me jealous of their long legs and how fast they can hike. I caught up with them at Chairback Gap Lean-to where the main group was planning on camping for the night. A little after I arrived, a middle aged man named Bernie and his 19 year old son and friend, Matthias and Nick, stopped in. The three of them climbed Katahdin and are hiking the 100 miles. They were planning on going to Cloud Pond Lean-to as was I. We left the shelter after lunch to do the final 7 miles which was a series of peaks- Columbus, Third Mtn, Mount Three and a Half, Fourth Mnt, and halfway up Barren. Around the time I was sumiting Fourth Mnt, a thunderstorm rolled in and the temperature dropped drastically. It was a cold, slippery decent from Fourth Mtn during which I fell and slid on my butt multiple times. I kept looking for the turn off for the lean-to because I knew I still had a 0.4 hike from the trail once I reached the turn off. I was terrified I had missed it and would be stuck hiking in the dark, rainy woods until 8 or later. I eventually came upon Bugs's tent and called out to him asking if he knew where it was. He said it was right past his tent and he'd camped there instead of doing the extra 0.4. When I finally got there, I was cold and wet and happy that no one else was there so I could strip in the lean-to and change into something dry.

It would be an 18 mile day for Bugs and 25 miles for Buck total. I stopped at the second shelter for the day even though it was early. After yesterday, I needed a break.

I wrote up a plan to get me to Stratton which is 75 miles from here. I'm hoping to be there in about a week, maybe the 18th or 19th. I'll probably zero there. Caratunk which is near the halfway mark has a hostel near the trail that I'll probably hit too.

Dragon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569335,"I elected to take a short day instead of pushing for the 17.9 miles and will likely take the longer of the two plans I made for getting to Stratton. There were several reasons for this. Coming out of the wilderness, it was in the 90s and my pack straps were soaked with sweat. I was only wearing a tank top and the straps rubbed my shoulders raw. I had a nasty band of blisters over my right shoulder. Hopefully the short day will give that extra time to heal. It's supposed to be cooler tomorrow which makes better hiking weather. Also, the shorter plan has me doing Moxie Bald Mountain and Pleasant Pond Mountain on separate days instead tackling them together. The downside is that I'll get to Caratunk in the evening instead of around lunchtime. Depending on when I get there, I might zero to take care of laundry and resupplying. I saw Last Buck this morning. I told him I was going to try for the 17.9 miles and he said he was too.

I asked the other 4 if they would mind and they were perfectly fine with it. In fact, Squeaky said if I ever wanted to hang it in the shealter and someone gave me a hard time about it that he'd claim I was toting food for him. The type of friendship and acceptance that had developed in this group is comforting and freeing.

Hiking Bald Pate today made yesterday's difficult climbs seem less strenuous. The initial climb up wasn't bad but the 3.5 miles between lean-tos was one of the harder sections I've hiked so far. Going up to the first peak, there was a part where I had to crawl to maintain enough traction on this rock slab. There was also a ladder with a rope at the top of it to assist you. If I was responsible for planning a trail, the need for a ladder and rope would make me rethink my route. The first mile or so down from the peak wasn't much better. I had to take small slow steps to ensure I didn't fall. I called for a ride from the second lean-to around 3:15. I thought I'd hit the road a bit after 4:30 so I asked for a 5:00 shuttle.

It has been a great experience with delicious food and good company. Andover definitely grew on me during my stay. 
David drove me to the trailhead and warned of thunderstorms that were supposed to roll in around 2. I took this information to heart and decided to do a short hike to the first shelter. I considered zeroing but I felt it was important to my mental state to follow up the good slackpacking days by putting on my full pack to hike, even if it was a shorter day. A short day wasn't a bad idea either as Mahoosuc Arm and Notch are immediately after the shelter and are not the types of things that should be done in a storm. 
I originally intended to stay in the shelter with a few NOBO's, two lost day hikers, and Old Timer and Red Beard. I hoped by doing this that it would save my tarp from getting wet which would add to my pack weight. The shelter wasn't shingled yet but at first there was only one apparent leak. As the storm ramped up though, the entire roof began to have problems. I attempted to rig a tarp, supplied by one of the NOBOs, inside the shelter. That was working okay but I sensed that it could go downhill at any moment. I decided to run out in the pouring rain and find a place to hammock.

She seemed impressed with my hammock hanging ability. She said that it looked like a warm burrito that she wanted to eat but also sleep in. 
Once I started hiking, I got excited about going down Mahoosuc Arm and through Mahoosuc Notch. People had been talking about those sections since I reached Andover. 
The Arm seemed a frightening idea, rock slabs at steep angles that required you to ""swing from tree to tree,"" as one NOBO put it, to climb up it. I had an image of a water slide made of rock that was going to have me sliding along on my butt for a mile. It wasn't as bad as some people made it out to be, but it wasn't easy either. I did sit down once to try to scoot down a steeper section. I ended up losing too much friction and sliding at an alarming speed for 20 feet. I tried to slow myself down which only served to remove a layer of skin from the tip of one of my fingers. 
After the Arm I found I was still excited for the Notch. I kept thinking, ""It's Notch day."" The Notch is supposed to be the hardest mile of the trail and involves climbing through a pit of boulders without much guidance as to the best way to go about getting over (or sometimes under) them. I enjoyed the first half immensely. It was a huge change from my normal day. I felt challenged but prepared and competent. The day was warm but deep in the crevices under the boulders there was still snow. It had a nice cooling effect that reminded me of air conditioning. A little past the halfway mark there was an arrow pointing up indicating that was the way I was supposed to go. I tried for 15 minutes to grab a ledge that was just out of reach before deciding to ignore the arrow and find an alternative route. Shortly after that, my wrists began to hurt from climbing and pushing off rocks for 2 hours. My initial enthusiasm for the bouldering was dying and I was eager to be done.

This has drastically improved my mood. Grey Ghost came in this evening from Rt 2. He took a nasty fall and earlier today and had a bad cut on his shin which he had glued closed at a doctor's.

I'm happy that I'm frustrated though because it means that I want to hike. It shows that I'm still motivated to continue my journey.

If I can, I'd like get to Mitzpah Spring Hut by tomorrow evening. It's like 13 miles but I've already done a majority of the climb by climbing up Madison to get on the ridge line. I ate spam tortillas for dinner because I didn't want to waste too much of my food on an extra zero day I wasn't planning for.

I woke up at 4:30 and started my hike before 6:15. I spent most of the morning hiking through a heavy fog or low level cloud cover. I'm not exactly sure where the line for fog ends and cloud begins. The terrine was hard. The entire mountain top was covered in a jumble of rocks. I felt discouraged hiking up Washington because I thought I wouldn't get a view. 
When I reached the summit around noon, there was a huge line of tourists at the sign for the top of the mountain, so I didn't even try to get a picture there.
I went into the visitors' center at the top of the mountain to try to get lunch from the snack bar. The snack bar was cash only and I didn't have a lot of cash to spare. I got a couple of hot dogs and a soda before realizing there was an ATM. That allowed me to add ice cream, pretzels, and a cup of tea to my lunch and gave me extra money to buy soup and snacks from the huts. While I sat in the visitors' center and charged my phone, the clouds cleared and eventually offered a decent view. 
I felt better when I left the top of Washington around 1. I got soup from the Lakes of the Clouds Hut where decided to hike to Mizpah Hut. When I was approaching Mizpah, Lion caught up to me and we hiked the last half mile together. The hut had eight free bunks and I offered to pay for Lion to stay as a guest. He was good company and I know the huts are something that most hikers can't afford to do. Being able to give him that experience felt good for me.

Dragon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573308,"This morning started out well. I started my hike around a quarter after 6, which is an earlier start than normal for me. It was fairly warm and wasn't raining anymore even though is was rather foggy and cloudy. I climbed Mt. Garfield before summiting the main mountain for the day- Mt. Lafayette. Visibility was low for the entirety of my ascent. There were several times when I thought I saw the top only for a vague, taller shadow to emerge from the fog ahead of me. Lafayette is supposed to offer a good view but I saw nothing but clouds from the top. The sky cleared as I walked along the ridge line over Mt. Lincoln and Little Haystack. On the top of Little Haystack I called the place I was planning on staying for the night only to find out that they were booked. It was the same story for everywhere else I called. I texted Beast and asked him if he knew of anywhere else I could try and he told me about an unlisted hostel that he could show me if I could get to the main street in Lincoln. I hiked one of my longest days in the Whites before coming to the I-93 underpass. Since the place I wanted to stay offered shuttles but was booked, I found myself hitchhiking for the first time. There is an area near the underpass where a car could pull over to pick someone up, but after trying for 20 minutes I became frustrated and decided that I'd walk the 9 miles to town if I had to. It was only a few minutes before I came to a bridge that informed me that pedestrians were prohibited from crossing it. I then walked back to the trail, back tracked a tenth of a mile, and took a 1 mile paved bike trail to the Flume Visitor Center. I was frustrated that I had done so many miles only to be stranded. My only comfort, which I kept reminding myself to be grateful for, was that it wasn't raining. I got to the parking lot near the visitor center and sat under a tree for awhile. I've been offered rides in previous parking lots when I didn't need them, and I hoped that if I looked like a needy hiker someone would ask me if I needed to go into town. I couldn't find any listed taxi services and even tried Uber. After sitting around for 30 minutes, it began to rain and something inside of me cracked and I cried for the first time since my journey began. I knew that crying wasn't going to solve anything, so I pulled myself together and walked to the visitor center, which didn't even offer shelter from the rain as it had closed 15 minutes beforehand. A guy I had met at Imp Shelter was hiding under an overhang and called out to me. He told me that hitching off of Rt 3 near the visitor center wasn't too difficult and he wished me luck. Not even 10 minutes of walking down Rt 3 earned me a ride from a guy covered in paint with a messy car. I was so grateful. I will eternally remember messy car guy fondly. He even knew of the hostel Beast had told me about, so he dropped me off at the front door. I texted Beast when I got into town. He told me he was catching a 7:00 showing of the new Spider-Man movie and I was welcome to join him. I grabbed some town clothes from the hostel and made it to the theater just in time. It was a good ending to what had been a rather stressful day.","Galehead Hut

Dragon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573320,"Beast's brother and friend drove 2 hours to visit him in town today. Beast knew of a cliff jump near the trail a few miles north of town. His brother drove the four of us to McDonald's for lunch and then to the spot with the jump. There were 3 places to jump from which were approximately 20ft, 30ft, and 40ft drops to the water. I spent some time watching people jump and swimming nearby which I was excited to do as I hadn't gone swimming yet this summer. A little before we left, I decided to attempt a jump. I really wanted to do the 30ft jump but I couldn't get up the nerve. There was a rock that needed to be cleared, and that could have been done easily enough, but it got to my head. It didn't help that Beast kept saying, ""Just don't hit the rock."" So I ended up doing the 20ft jump. I can't be too disappointed in myself; after all, it was my first cliff jump ever. Maybe next time I'll try for more. Afterwards we got food and a couple beers at a local bar, during which Beast resolved to take another zero day instead of attempting to hike to the next shelter a few miles from town. It was a great zero day for me. It felt like getting a small taste of the parties and swimming I'm missing because I'm out here instead of spending the summer at home.","

I probably have enough hair at this point for that not to be as much of a concern.Beast and I grabbed breakfast at McDonald's this morning before getting to Rt. 3 and parting ways to different trailheads. It was a sunny, hot day even in the morning hours. I walked over a mile before finally hitching a ride. Beast showed me the sign he uses for hitchhiking. He carries a large bandana that says he's a hiker trying to get to the trail. It makes sense to me that it would be useful to have something like that, especially after walking on a hot road in the sun for so long today. I assume a lot of people would be hesitant to stop if they have no idea why you're hitchhiking. I would think the additional information on the bandana would make hitching easier. I passed my last AMC hut today, Lonesome Lake Hut. It was one of the prettiest ones I've seen. I stopped by for lunch and got to spectate a NOBO game of Yahtzee for a while before getting back to the trail. A day hiker told me they passed Halloween at a crossing in front of me. I was excited to meet him because I had heard from his brother-in-law. By the time I got to camp though it was late and there were a lot of people; the shelter was full and at least a half dozen camp set ups were present.

He's interviewing NOBOs as he's hiking south. He said that when he gets closer to completing the trail he's going to interview SOBOs. It sounded like a cool project. 
I was feeling lonely today. I think spending time with Beast in town emphasized to me how much I miss the companionship I experienced earlier in the hike. Most nights when I get to the shelter or campground there are groups of NOBOs or section hikers who have their own social group or who prefer to set up a tent and be left alone. Instead of feeling connected and talking about the day and future plans, I set up for the night and go to bed. It makes me wish for someone to hike with. Maybe I can catch up to Beast and/or Rapunzel, last I heard they were about 2 days ahead of me. I think if I caught up, I could keep up, but catching up is so hard.
I completed the first 1.5 miles up the last of the White Mountains, Moosilauke, today. I was told the first 1.5 miles was the hardest part of the climb. 
I shared the shelter tonight with two 17 year old boys who have a plan to hike through the Whites over the course of the next 2 weeks or so. I got to suggest my first trail name- Deadweight. He carries too much, including a camp chair, and has an impractical heavy knife at home that he said he named Deadweight. The two boys were looking for trailnames and I thought it was appropriate.

I also talked to him about how he feels that he's boring. That's complete nonsense of course, and I tried to point that out to him. He is a more stable and less free spirited person than I am though.

I hit the streets of Hanover, which are part of the trail, around 11 this morning. I got breakfast at a grocery co-op. I had half a pound of Greek pasta salad, a fancy chocolate bar, and apple juice. 
I met a couple there who were headed south with a 1 year old baby. They said they were doing a flip-flop hike and had already done the southern half, so that baby has gone over half the length of the trail. I can't imagine doing something like this carrying a child. 
The road led me out of Hanover on a bridge over the Connecticut River and into Norwich, Vermont. I met Ash (like Pokémon) a little after the bridge crossing. The people of Norwich seem to take great pride in being hiker friendly. The trail goes down a road that is mostly residential and many houses had coolers in front of them with free sodas or snacks. Ash and I partook of some this, but I was still mostly full from my breakfast at the co-op. 
It drizzled on and off today, and by the time I got to West Hartford, I was cold and wet. I sat on the porch of a house owned by a trail angle that the Omelette Guy had told me about. That earned me another soda for the day. Ash and another guy showed up there a bit after I did. We talked about doing the bridge jump near the house, but I said I was cold and wet enough without it. Even though they seemed interested in it, they must have agreed with me because none of us took the plunge. 
It was nearing sunset when I got to the shelter which was packed full. I hung my tarp and hammock and had a quick dinner before hanging my bear bag. I threw it over a taller tree that was leaning at a fairly steep angle. The weight of my bag broke the tree but that tree landed against another taller tree which held it up in a perfect position for hanging my bag. Even if it wasn't a good location though, it was getting too dark to find another option. 
Maybe 15 minutes after lying down, I heard the tension in my tarp line snap and saw it sag. I had to get out in the dark with a light drizzle to find out what had happened. One of the fancy accessories that were attached to my ridge line had snapped in one place. It was still usable as it was but I was surprised that it broke.

I didn't make my 20 miles. It was 4PM when I got to the shelter I decided to stay at overnight. I wanted to continue on but the next shelter is over 8 miles away over 2 mountains. I would have attempted it anyway but there aren't any water sources between here and there either, so if I ended up camping early, I'd be out of water in the morning. 
This shelter is right next to the trail and I never saw Goose and Maverick pass. Maybe they decided to hang out with Chris and Scott and have a short day too.","Greenwall Shelter

I told the people that I had shared the shelter with that I was planning on finding a doctor when I got to town that afternoon. I was aiming to be in town around noon. I kept myself at a good pace and decent level of sanity by forcing myself to believe the lie that somehow my poison ivy rash would magically be cured when I got to the parking lot. From 7:20 to 10:20 I hiked 7.1 miles to the top of Bromley Mountain. By that time, I think my body had released enough endorphins from the physical activity that my legs didn't seem nearly as bad. I took a break on the top of the mountain with a handful of NOBOs, one of whom had a small juice box sized container of wine and was willing to share. I called the Green Mountain House to ensure that they had room for me, which they did. They told me to run my town errands and to call them afterwards for a ride to the hostel. I hiked the rest of the way to road and got a hitch to the post office from a '62 Ford pickup. The place where I was going to resupply was a mile across town, so I stopped at a Ben & Jerry's stand to get a banana split in order to fuel that trip. The hostel was a great place. I laid my second pair of shoes to rest there. A group of NOBOs ended up baking bread (Spit Fire) and apple pie (Peregrine). The hostel also had $2 Ben and Jerry's pints in the freezer, so I indulge in that for a second time. I still feel itchy but it's not as bad. I think I was being re-exposed to the oil in my sleeping bag but I got a new bag in my mail drop today. I'm going to see how the rash heals on its own and if it's still bothering me when I get to Williamstown in a few days, I'll see a doctor. I'm signed up for a 7:30 shuttle back to the trail tomorrow.

If the shuttle left at 7:30, I'm guessing that I started hiking around 7:45. I stopped at Stratton Shelter for lunch where I met up with Preacher and Stretch again. Bombadil had signed the log book a couple days ago and asked if I was still hiking. I wrote a comment in the margin that I was still at it. I also wrote that I was doing my first 20 mile day; I knew it- do or do not, there is no try.I was told that Stratton Mountain was a fairly gradual climb in comparison to what I've seen so far. I agree with that assessment but it was a loooong climb. Even a gradual rise like that takes its toll given enough time. The fire tower on top of the mountain was a nice reward for the work it took to get there though and the descent was nice as well. I finished hiking around 7:15. Preacher, Stretch, Joel, and Tiffany are here tonight. I'm hammocking without my tarp for the first time since it's not supposed to rain and I get to use my new sleeping bag for the first time.

It was a few days ago when I was climbing Killington that I discovered that going up was more tolerable if I distracted myself. When I climbed Stratton Mountain yesterday, I reasoned 60 verses of Henry VIII would get me close to the top. It wasn't quite enough but it almost took me all the way. Going up Glastenbury Mountain today, I mentally sung 100 verses of Henry VIII and then started counting down with 100 Bottles of Beer. I was getting concerned towards the end, but I managed to reach the summit with 44 bottles left. 
My intended picture for the day was the view from the fire tower on top of Glastenbury, but that view turned out to be almost identical to the one offered from Stratton Mountain. 
I arrived at Goddard Shelter soon after the mountain. I had already written in the log book that I was going to continue hiking to the next shelter when thunder was heard in the distance. In an attempt to remain true to the promise I made to the book, I continued on despite the looming threat. I did get caught in a 15 minute thunderstorm. It poured and the initial lightning strike couldn't have been more than a quarter mile from me. It's amazing how much energy I find that I have when I'm frightened of being struck down by the sky.
My poison ivy rash feels less itchy, but my self control is waning. I scratched up my ankle pretty bad in an attempt to find relief. To add to my discomfort, it's been hot enough that I've been sweating profusely and it's been causing chafing where I carry my pack on my hips as well as on my butt. I'm wondering if Body Glide might fix this. 
I'm running low on my water treatment drops and am unsure if I'll be able to make it to Salisbury where I'll have more waiting for me at the post office. I'm going to try to make it but I might need a solution sooner rather than later.","Story Spring Shelter

I had been trying very hard to ignore the itching sensation that had taken over most of my lower legs and seems to be claiming limited thigh territory. Right before VT 9, there is a stream and bridge crossing. I found myself tearing off my pack and climbing down a steep bank in order to submerge my legs in the cold water because of my need for relief. It was at that time that I finally admitted to myself that my rash had gotten out of hand and required medical attention. 
I called Bennington Taxi, who only charged $10 for a ride to the emergency clinic in town. While I waited in the parking lot for them to show up, my rash gained enough attention that a NOBO asked to take a picture of my legs. 
I got a prescription for a tapering dose of prednisone which I can start taking tomorrow morning. After picking that up from Rite Aid, I got dinner and, of course, ice cream at Friendly's where I paid to kill an hour or so playing Plants vs Zombies.","Melville Nauheim Shelter

I hiked through intermittent rain for most of the day. I spoke with NoCode on the phone while I was staying in Bennington and we discussed possible wedding plans. As I was walking today, I think I came up with the first few lines of my wedding vows. 
I ran into the group that Milkshake had been hiking with- Matador, Bender, and Echo. They asked me when I'd last seen her as they had assumed I had been hiking with her. I told them I hadn't seen her since Rutland but that the log books led me to believe that she was a few days ahead of me.

Shortly afterwards I met Emily who was starting the Long Trail. She seemed excited about my journey as well as about starting her own. I wished her luck. I've seen a few people in the last 100 miles who were hiking the Long Trail through Vermont, but there was something especially encouraging about seeing her enthusiasm at the start of her trip. Halfway up Mt. Prospect there was a cooler with beer and a couple water bottles for thru hikers. I poured a water bottle into one of my canteens and drank a Magic Hat #9 before continuing my climb. After Mt. Prospect was Mt. Williams which brought me most of the way through the elevation for Mt. Greylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts. I got an early dinner at the lodge on top of Mt.

Fairly early in the day I passed a few northbounders who told me of a Dunkin Donuts not far off trail in Adams. I felt that I was making okay time and that the energy from the sugar and calories from a Dunkin Donuts visit would make up for time lost stopping in for a bite. I got a breakfast sandwich, doughnut, and iced cappuccino. I also bought a bottle of water to supplement my supply and save my water treatment drops. 
I took a short break around noon to check my progress. I was less than 4 miles from the post office. Also, the rain that was originally predicted to start at 10 had been pushed back to 3. At the rate I was going, it looked like I was going to make the post office by 2. 
I surprised myself with my speed and ended up at the post office at 1, 2 hours and 30 minutes earlier than my original plan.

I grabbed breakfast a the McDonald's across the street from the hotel before I tried to find a way to get back to the Dalton post office to resume my hike. My first idea was to call Tom who shuttled me to the Econo Lodge and said he was listed in Guthook. While Tom's house is in Guthook, his phone number is not. My second idea was Uber. My first attempt resulted in a car that remained stationary for 15 minutes. I tried a second time before finally getting a lift. 
So many people I've talked to have told me to stop by Upper Goose Pond Cabin. It's 0.5 miles off trail, which normally deters most thru hikers, so I thought it had to be worth the stop to be so universally recommend. It was about 21 miles from the post office which meant either pushing for it today or passing it midday tomorrow and skipping it altogether. I decided to make the push. 
On my way there, I ran into a van with a picture of the ghost Casper on the side it and the words, ""The AT Friendly Van"". The owner of the van also ran a hostel in Tennessee and had been driving north with the NOBO bubble to offer trail magic. I gladly accepted 2 sodas and a small blueberry pie from him before moving on. 
I saw my second porcupine a bit afterwards. In my attempt to get to Upper Goose Pond, I was moving faster than I normally do and I didn't see the porcupine until I was a few feet from him. He apparently didn't see me either because he jumped and attempted to move off the trail. He eyed me angerly as I moved past him as apologetically as possible. 
I made it to Upper Goose Pond Cabin just after twilight. The caretaker was very nice and told me that the bunks were full but she could find me a place on the floor if I'd prefer that to camping. I took the floor option.

The late night arrival and number of miles covered yesterday left me feeling drained and lazy. The temperature being higher than it has been didn't help the situation. A couple miles before the shelter was a honour system stand that sold drinks and snacks. I bought the last two drinks in the fridge- 2 Pepsi's. I drank one there with the intention of trading the second one for water at the shelter. I passed 2 NOBOs before re-entering the woods who asked me about the stand and I told them I had purchased the last soda but was willing to trade it for water. They took stock of their supply and offered me a liter. When I got to the turn off for the shelter, a guy who had set up his tent nearby let me use his filter on a liter of water as well.

It was a several miles long, well maintained dirt track with almost no elevation change. I was surprised by how difficult it was. I don't think my body is used to being able to take longer strides at that speed for so long. Halfway through, the backs of my thighs started to burn.

I thought if I was lucky, the food truck, which was also mentioned in the Guide, would be parked nearby so I could have some real food.

I was thinking about stopping at the Clarence Fahnestock State Park for a snack and maybe a quick shower since I made good time for the first part of the day. The first side trail to it is listed as being 0.2 miles which wasn't too far out of the way. The AT Guide said that it was a green blazed trail and I took it at its word even though I've never seen green blazes before. I passed several blue blazed trails before I ended up at a road crossing. Before crossing the road there was a map of the state park area and what turned out to be the second turn off for the state park that involved a 1 mile side trail. Apparently all the trails going to Clarence Fahnestock State Park are blazed in blue. I was a bit disappointed by this but not terribly so. It meant that I was closer to my final destination that I thought I was. I could wait until I go to the hotel to shower.

After he left, No Code and I went to the hotel that I'll be staying in for the next few days. It was a Sheraton and it looked pricey. No Code explained that my desire to have a pool and my parents' need for it to be pet friendly left very few other options. Walking into the Sheraton dirty and in my hiking clothes with a backpack that I assumed smelled of the inevitable thru-hiker stench, I felt like a trespasser. It's not the first time I've felt that way on my hike, but it was the most noticable. The hotel was nicer than most places I had stayed at before starting my hike.

We then got in the car and they dropped us off at Dennytown Rd. where I had left the trail the day before. There were a few elevations changes in the morning but nothing extreme. It was mostly cloudy and occasionally it would mist rain but for the most part the weather stayed good for hiking. If anything, the intermittent misting kept the temperature down to a more comfortable level although it was horribly humid. We heard bells as we neared and passed the turn off for the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center a little bit before a steeper downhill to the intersection of US 9 and NY 403 where there's a deli. When we were approaching it, we saw Shadow crossing the road from the deli towards us. He said he was staying at Graymoor for the day. We swung into the deli for lunch. I refueled on what I normally go to for lunch- sugar, while No Code ordered actual food. We were going to try to make good time for the second half of the day because I wanted to get to the zoo before it closed. The AT goes through the zoo and I didn't want to miss it and have to take the path around it. The elevation changes seemed to get more intense but maybe that was perspective. On the way downhill to the deli, No Code started to complain about knee pain. When we tried to pick up speed, he started to really hurt. We ended up slowing down to a crawl. I was walking as slow as I could and I still had to stop several times to wait for him. I knew the last few miles were practically flat and mostly paved. I kept telling him that things would get better after that. We got to NY 9D and his knee pain quickly faded as we followed the road to the Bear Mountain Bridge which crosses the Hudson. Shortly after crossing the Hudson we entered the Trailside Museum and stopped to take a few pictures at the bear cage which is the lowest elevation on the AT. I kept making jokes about it being all uphill from there. Even though we had to slow down for his knee, we made good time.
