Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550076,"Our first leg of the journey found us traveling to Amicalola Falls State Park to rendezvous with our son, daughter and her fiance. We stayed the night in a cabin sorting though our backpacks and first resupply boxes. What a beautiful evening with a great sunset and fantastic late summer weather! Our son was excited to discover we were leaving him in care of our vehicle ... it will be one more thing for us to worry about on while we're on the trail ... but allows him a bit more security and independence while at school. Our other son is home holding down the house and caring for the 14.5 year old dog we are sad to leave behind.Tomorrow is the big day!",,Amicalola Falls State Park,"Sep 03, Sat",0
Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550077,"After eating a grand breakfast at the Lodge, signing the thru-hiker register at the Visitor's Center, and weighing our packs - the 5 of us drove to the AT trail head parking lot, hiked to the top of Springer Mountain together, took ton of photos, then hiked the .9 miles back to the parking lot to say out goodbyes. It was quite a bit later in the day than we had originally planned to depart. Our packs weighed more than we thought they might ... so our first day's hike ended a bit short of the planned destination.Long Creek Falls is a beautiful site. We pitched our tent (for the very first time - EVER) and enjoyed dinner by the falls. Bear bagging for the fist time was a hoot.We are loving the outdoors!","Springer Mountain

There has been serious drought in Georgia and many of the ""reliable"" water sources are dry, but this creek is beautiful! Here, we meet up with a section hiker we have been leap frogging for most of the day. Her name is Rosemary and she hails from Bozeman, MT. A newly wed couple from Austria are also tented here. Julia is Austrian and Roberto is Italian, they have fast become known as the European Union The poison ivy has been a challenge!","Long Creek Falls

Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550215,"We wrapped up camp several minutes after our new friends and then got on trail wearing shorts that I never thought I would wear.We stopped at Gooch Mountain Shelter to check out the bear cables. The first two evenings of bear bagging have been comedic, perhaps cables would be the right way to go.We met some trail runners with the Georgia Appalachian Trail, talking with them was great. We have tried out quite a few of our equipment selections and have an idea of what is working for us and what is not. Tonight we are headed to the Hiker Hostel with Rosemary, Julia and Roberto; this will be a first time at a hostel as a hiker.","Justus Creek

Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550231,"What a great day! It would seem logical that hiking without 30lbs on your back would be delightful ... good to know I was right! We did hike with two liters of water each and basic food/supplies in a day pack provided by the hostel.Last night we enjoyed a pizza delivered to the Hiker Hostel. It was fun to watch Roberto experience his first ""American"" pizza. We assured him that it was not the same as a pizzeria pizza! He ate a large by himself, so I guess it wasn't so badOur first and second night at the hostel are actually spent in a ""container"" room. The common room(s) at the hostel has community activities, while the accommodation we've stayed in is up a path and separate. It has a bathroom with shower, a micro kitchen a queen size bed with drawers beneath it and two chairs to relax in.It has been a wonderful experience.","Woody Gap

Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550224,"WOW, it was much harder to hike over 11 miles WITH the heavy backpack! Our first night in a shelter provided a much easier evening set up! We are currently very inefficient with our morning pack-out routine. SOO much room for improvement! Our water system of choice is the Katadyn 6 liter gravity. It refills our water each day, provides for cooking/cleaning water and offers a bit to share with other hikers. We will keep the pills for backup, but send the Steri-pen system back after re-supply. Our Smart water bottle choice has been great, we will likely send all other containers back, except of the 2 ltr Platy.I have spent the last 10 years dreaming about everything I wanted to carry in my backpack for this hike ... and the last 5 days dreaming about what I can take out!","Neel Gap

Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550235,"By morning, our little family of hikers bequeathed trail names on each other. After hiking and basically living with each other for nearly a week, it was a good next step!Rosemary is ""Pacer"", as she sets a great pace at whatever level of hiking is required - for her or others around her. Julia is ""Chipmunk"", as she is so enamored by their playful presence on our everyday hiking. Roberto is ""Duo"" and the story is a bit long to share here. Willie is ""Gandolf"", christened when he finally settled upon a walking stick and proclaimed quite loudly, ""GANDOLF POWER"" to anyone who was within earshot! And I am ""Flicker"" so named because I hold the whole crew up with the flicking of photos.So today wasn't physically as long a journey, but after several longish days, I felt beaten down by the end of the hike. My feet struggle with neuropathy, as a result of chemo, and more than 10 miles a day of hiking is a real stress.Looking forward to our second hostel stay and our first re-supple box!","Low Gap Shelter

After a winter of celebrating with family, cheering at wrestling meets and preparing for the completion of the adventure, our journey has commenced! It has been a warm winter, and the Shenandoah hills are thawing quickly. Temps in the low 50's make for perfect hiking weather with only a few patches of left over snow and ice to contend with. It is Tuesday and SNP is still closed for the winter, so there are few people in the park. And no other hikers. There are fewer leaves under foot than in autumn - so more wildlife spotting! We saw 8 deer today.","Bootens Gap

Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558228,"Today's hike brought us into contact with several day hikers ... it was nice to see some faces and be able to chat a bit. The day was sunny and the ground is soaking up what is left of winter precipi tation. After over 13 miles of hiking, I realized I dropped my phone. BUMMER! Gandolf was able to locate a signal using ""find friends"" and we only had to double back about 1.5 miles ... we were able to locate the phone but 3 miles of extra hiking made it a long hiking day for us! Our choice to hike north in the off season has made this a fairly solitary experience. We have loved the quiet woods and the deserted shelters but miss the comradery of other thru hikers and places being open. It is also important to note that trail magic is a much simpler concept in off season. No ""hiker feeds"", just people looking out for others and doing what they can if they are in a position to help.","Skyland Rd. S.

Hiking in the early spring allows for wonderful views of the forest and Skyline Drive vistas for almost 100% of the day! Just have to watch out for sunburn and windburn.Met two NOBO's today, Skippy Jon Jones (started Jan 18), Man in Black (Jan 5th) these guys are really moving fast! Apparently there are about 5 hikers ahead of these guys ... so we are among the first hikers to get this far north.","Beahm's Gap

Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558273,"Today we leave the Shenandoah National Park. For hikers like Skippy, Man in Black and Foxtrot (a third thru-hiker we met) the passage through the SNP was measured in three or four days. For Gandolf and I, what began in December finally ended today!Our hike is not a traditional NOBO hike. It was not designed to be one and we are fully embracing the ""hike your own hike"" mantra. We are white blazers, who are taking time to look at vistas, experience trail towns, meet hostel owners and spend time getting to know a bit about their business and interests. We have stayed in stealth camp sites, designated camp sites, shelters, hostels, hotels, home stays, VBO's and Time Shares. We have not yet slept in a car/truck or under the stars, but anything is possible.We have hiked with packs with too much weight due to over-packing, too much weight from camel humping 5 liters of water due to drought, heavy pack due to tons of food for long number of nights on trail, reasonable weight packs and slack packs. I didn't submit journal entries during the first part of the hike ... I hope to stay up to date and continue to share our hike with friends and family. During this process, catch up on the older journals.Until then, the photo shared here, is of the box and ""back country hiking tag"" that thru-hikers where while hiking in SNP.","Skyline Drive (958.1)

Flicker and Gandalf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558300,"There is something special about the energy from other hikers on Saturdays. Families out picnicking together, couples holding hands on a stroll, friends exploring a trail together, all ways the AT gets visited and used by people - other than thru-hikers. It's good to remember that the ""Flicker and Gandolf NOBO '17"" thru-hike is not the only event of importance happening on the trail.The logistics of the hike are important, sometimes difficult, and often stressful. Rolling into a shelter, the concern for where we are going to set up camp is often a heavy weight. Is there water, is there wood for a camp fire, is there two spots open in the shelter, is there space for a tent.(and on and on). But stepping back and remembering that the reason for this hike is to embrace all the beauty, difficulties and silliness is important. Watching others enjoy the trail is a good way to get back to basics. The AT is a trail ... we are using it to hike to Maine ... this is an adventure!This, the first Saturday of spring, I saw flowers ... a nice reminder that warmer weather is approaching.","US Rt 522

We took three months off in the winter and our bodies went back to mush.  Even being on trail for a week wasn't enough to get us on track for today's ups and downs.It's not that any one hill is awful, just the accumulation of hillsWe did make it into Bear's Den right as it was opening and the pizza dinner was delightful!

Rain, and mist and damp and rain, it was a good choice to zero.We got laundry done, then headed into Harpers Ferry. We bought maps and checked out just about every nook of the ATC center! We spent a good amount of time looking to see when hikers we hiked with last fall passed through HF. Can't wait to get a move on tomorrow!","Bear's Den Hostel

I mean really! It has been a looooooong state!We said goodbye to our friend, fellow hiker, and SLASHER supreme ""Corky"" in late October of 2016. From there, we hiked alone until Luray, and finally called it ""enough"" on Dec 19th, and went home to celebrate Christmas with family. We returned to the point we left off - on March 21, and tomorrow we will be in Virginia for the last time!  This will be our last shelter in VA ... and it is beautiful! There is a picnic pavilion set up separate from the shelter - with a wooden swing and fire pit.  But my favorite part is the l shaped bench that borders the porch deck of the shelter ... just so relaxing.  It's supposed to be a chilly night, so maybe the benches will also serve as a wind break!","Bear's Den Hostel

It gives exact temperatures and other weather data for where you are, at only about an ounce added weight. I know, I know, who needs to know the weather when you're standing in it, but I do enjoy the factual data! Today's wake up temp was 31F. Since Daylight Saving Time, mornings have been getting brighter and brighter! I can't wait for the mornings to also be a bit warmer!It was a wonderful hike today, up into the Harpers Ferry National Park area and into Harpers Ferry!

The hostel experience has been a very pleasant one  First, there was ""trail magic"" dropped off at the Hostel - a very good lasagna - for hikers to have for dinner! Being off season thru hikers, we very (very very) rarely get trail magic! This was such an unexpected and appreciated gift, I just want to make sure everyone knows how special this made us feel! Second, there was an amazing young man from Australia that shared the hostel with us ... who was both really pleasant and fascinating! He is a very good kayaker - (like junior national team level - but really humble and modest) - who kept us entertained by tails (and video clips) of some of his adventures! 
Tomorrow we will head out in search of a state without the word Virginia in it!","Weverton Rd.

We also met some hikers along the way! One, ""Slip and Slide"" we met in November as she was finishing her SoBo thru. It was great catching up with her!The second hiker, ""No Name"" is a slasher on his third segment. This is the first hiker that we may be hiking with going the same direction in the same timeframe since Corky. Pine Knob Shelter lies just south of a very popular overlook, and the shelter itself is really quite small and dank - but we're here for the night.","Gapland Rd.

Our hunger has begun to kick in again and second only to the joy of finding and setting up camp, is the satisfaction of consuming a hearty lunch!
Tonight's shelter is BEAUTiFUL. Finished wood with lacquered floors! 
When we rolled into camp, there was a family of day hikers with small children visiting the shelter. The grandma mentioned that it was always a dream of hers to hike the AT, but events always stopped the plan from being executed. This really struck home to me, as Gandolf and I are working hard for this dream to come true for us! There are so many excuses and reasons and events that make this journey difficult to initiate and complete!  Every day out here we feel blessed ... exhausted but blessed!","Pine Knob Shelter

It was cold AND wet (soppy tent, tent fly, everything!) - just as if it had poured rain!
We enjoyed tenting at the park, I have to say that flush toilets are G-R-E-A-T!!!
We packed up and hiked the planned 7.5 miles before 11:30 so we could get off trail for the next few days to help family.
You see, this is a dream come true adventure for us, slammed in the middle of being a daughter and son and having a daughter and two sons. We still have responsibilities.
Today we are heading back to Highland Mills to catch a bus to NYC. We have the benefit of a gracious brother who will host us tonight and tomorrow night. Our plan is to visit Mami and take care of other family issues before heading to South Carolina to assist in the ""Big Move"" for my daughter and her fiancé.

Gandolf has several plans for the day, entirely concerning his family and mom. His mom has been in Hospice care since January, so he cherishes time he has to spend with her.
I was going to join him, but if you have ever battled Manhattan in a tsunami, you will understand why I elected to stay in a nice dry apartment. I'm working on trail journal entries - but I am incredibly slow at completing!!! I will also keep my feet up, hoping to relieve some of the residual neuropathy pain that I have been experiencing.

We depart the apartment at 8 am. We need to take a subway uptown two stops then get a transfer to catch a bus to LGA. Then take a flight to CAE with a connect in ATL. Gandolf will then meet up with future son-in-law to drive a moving van to Dover, NH via Richmond, VA. I will meet up with daughter to travel to Greenville, SC to get a nights rest at a hotel before her 6 am departure for her Puerto Rican adventure. That means a 3:30 am wake-up to get her there! Then I will depart for Dover, NH in daughter's car.  
I'm stopping for a brunch break in Marion, VA to see Corky!!! I'm going to stop in Philadelphia to visit/stay with my parents - then head to NH on Monday.
But first we have to make it to Columbia.
Ten minutes out the door, Gandolf is notified by Delta that our flight from LGA to ATL is 3 hours delayed. This means we will miss the two connections to CEA that are available! CRAP.
We arrive LGA, change our flight to go to Charlotte (an additional 6 hour wait), call the kids, let them know what they need to do to make the new plan work, and hunker down in a set of chairs to wait it out.
