Kasha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555050,"Like sparkling dew droplets clinging to the quaking leaf in the early morning sun light the diamonds rest in my hand.Sleeping bag, pad and boots acquired this last week. Bag weighs in at three pounds three ounces, sleep pad at fourteen ounces and the boots are at one kilo each. Thinking everything is in place gear wise except for a couple of sheets of Tyvek. Going to put together the comprehensive gear list and shake it out in the coming week. Will get all in weight after resolving the packing process. Just a note: Testing the boots this week. Work great but the laces are too long. This issue will need corrective action as the laces drag, tangle and in general are a nuisance.
