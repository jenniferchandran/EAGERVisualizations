Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554868,"Three weeks from tomorrow I start my NOBO hike on the Appalachian Trail with my friend John. I did the Georgia sections fifteen or so years ago and since then the trail has been on my mind.I've hiked and backpacked a lot over the years but this will be my first attempt at a long trail. My wife and I completed the Camino de Santiago in October with mileage just under 500 but that's a different sort of walk - one where you end each day with a hot meal, a cold beer and a night in a bed somewhere. It was still a challenge and a spiritual blessing but certainly nothing close to my expectations of the AT. We didn't see a single bear but we did run into a couple of aggressive donkeys (the animal type, not the human type).My pack weight is almost half what it was when I did the 80 or so miles in Georgia all those years ago - largely due to significant improvements in technology and some learning on my part so I am encouraged by that.I plan to post as often as possible but certainly not everyday and I hope you enjoy following the adventure. Feel free to share comments along the way - encouragement is always a good thing!If all goes well I'll see all of you in September.P.S. If you're curious about the Camino trip you can find our blog at this site: trailjournals.com/patandlinda. I'm grateful to Trail Journals for creating such an easy and useful tool for capturing the experience in real time.",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Sun",0
Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555874,"I think I made my last trip to REI today. Bought a small supply of freeze dried food, another pair of socks and the lightest T-shirt I could find. I have plenty of technical fiber tees from my many runs I've done but they all are of the shiny type if you know what I mean. The shirt I bought today is technical fiber but has a softer feel, so I thought I might try it.As much hiking as I've done I think I have everything pretty much figured out in terms of gear although I'm sure I'll make plenty of adjustments early on. I always take more than I need so I've been very diligent about winnowing the ""stuff"" and at this point I'm wondering if I'm bringing enough.Outdoor Adventures is only three days into the hike so if I'm missing something I'm sure they can fix me up.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555875,Two days until we hit the car and just over four days until we hit the trail.I'm wearing Vasque Monolith hiking boots and sort of at the last minute I mail ordered another pair. I had great luck with these well made boots during my Camino walk and I thought having an extra pair ready to go was a wise choice. I've been walking in them for the last few days to get them broken in a bit although with my first pair I found I didn't need any real break-in period.I'm thinking about the trail all the time now so I know it's time to get going - to start putting the miles behind me. I've been thinking about this adventure for almost twenty years and now it's time to go.My next post will be onsite somewhere - probably Amicalola Falls but it won't be long before I'm posting from the trail!,,Counting the hours,"Mar 08, Wed",0
Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556247,"Today is our first unofficial day on the Trail. We're not going to be very ambitious today - we're walking the one mile up to the Springer Mountain starting point. It was a great opportunity to share at least a mile with the wives and we took all the appropriate pictures. I'll post those when I get a chance.We've had this incredibly warm winter and it just seems fit now that when we leave for the trail the coldest weather of the winter moves in. We're expecting lows in the teens Tuesday evening, although right now it's almost 50 outside. But we have figured an escape route and right now we're planning on staying in a hostel on Tuesday night. I've become wise enough to know when to wimp out.Met 'Schlog' yesterday at the top of Springer - a nice young man from North Carolina and we're hoping to bump into him again along the way. I'm excited to be sharing the trail with a bunch of like minded people and I'm looking forward to meeting many of them soon.","Springer Mountain

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556442,"Linda and Debbie drove us up to the Springer Mountain parking area with winds howling and some cold weather hanging around. A quick picture, quick kiss goodbye and a quick hug and off they went. So now what?With the wind and cold we know the best thing was to get started. The first few miles of the trail are a gentle slope downhill or flat , providing a very false sense of how easy this might be. There are ups and downs all over the trail and it wasn't long before we were walking uphill, slowing down and wishing we were in better shape. I've learned from a long life of hiking in the mountains that it's almost impossible to really get in shape for the climbs. You just do them and before long you get your trail legs and the climbs don't seem quite so bad.Reached Hawk Mountain shelter early afternoon and the shelter was full already. Before the day was over we estimated that between the shelter and tents there were probably 50-60 people camped around the shelter. Someone started a fire and we kept warm huddled around the file getting to know as many other hikers as we could. There was a mix of thru-hikers and section hikers so we're not sure yet who we will be seeing down the trail. We tried learning trail names but many people, just like me, don't have trail names yet. I'm waiting for some inspiration to see what feels right - I'll keep you posted.We passed on a hot meal and just ate our power bars, jerky and other snacks. For some reason I don't have much of an appetite the first couple of days on a trail but I'm sure that will change.Reports of snow and cold for tomorrow so we will see what it looks like.Until then...","Springer Mountain Trailhead Parking

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556440,"Woke up our first morning on the trail to about two inches of snow and strong winds. Packed up as quick as we could and just hit the trail. Walking is the best way to stay warm so off we went, walking north. A little icy at the beginning while the mud was still frozen and then as the sun hit the trail it became sloppy. I knew I'd fall at least once on the trail and halfway through the morning I went down. Glad to get that fall out of the way. Now I should be good for the next 2,175 miles.We reached Cooper's Gap with word that the winds were going to stay around and that the forecast for the night was high of 20 maybe the teens. Being old and wise we started to call for a ride with the plan to stay the night in Dahlonega. The ride services were very busy and we ended up waiting for a little over five hours before Richard took us in to the Quality Inn.Through the day there was a small crowd of people who stopped and found rides and for several hours there were small groups of people walking in circles trying to stay warm. John and I were among them.But it really wasn't that bad - we've got good gear and I stayed tolerably warm. Kept moving to keep the toes OK and everything went fine.Iwant to shout out to Jake, a Forest Service guy, who checked in on our rag tag group a couple of times making sure everyone was dry and safe while we waited for rides. Jake filled us in on weather conditions and provided lots of great advice. This kind of caring guy makes us all feel a little safer on the trail.The weather is staying around for another day so we decided to stay one more day in Dahlonega. March 15 will be our first zero day - about a week earlier than we planned but there's no sense in being miserable. Thursday the temps are supposed to be in the 50s which will make a much better hike.Until then...","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556650,"Our original plan was to get off the trail at Woody Gap to take a brief rest in town. Because of the five mile restricted area over Blood Mountain we decided to stick to our original schedule and plan. The restriction requires persons who camp in the five mile area to have bear canisters and we don't have one.So...that left us with exiting the trail again today at Woody Gap because there's no shelter or camping at the Gap.. Tomorrow we'll start a stretch that will keep us on the trail for at least five days and nights. Today the walk was great. We started in temps below freezing but when the sun reached its high point we were warm and in good spirits. It felt good to loosen some zippers and peel back a layer rather than tightening them more. We slack packed the 8.3 miles since we were coming back to the same hotel for the night. For those wondering, slack packing means leaving the big pack at the hotel and carrying only water, enough food for the day, the first aid kit, phones and little else. We were carrying just a few pounds each and it made for a much faster walk. We covered the 8.3 miles in five and a half hours including a long lunch break. We wish we could keep that pace the entire way but the packs slow us down a bit.Weather cleared up today and for the first day we had some great vistas and views. When you hike a trail like this you tend to keep your eyes at your feet making sure you step safely and you have to remind yourself to look up every once in a while to see the beauty around you. We stopped for a long lunch break at an overlook across a valley. The picture above doesn't do it justice but we're glad the weather is finally cooperating enough to get some views from the tops of the mountains.Tomorrow we go over Blood Mountain, one of the highest mountains in Georgia and it will be our first double digit mile day. With full packs we certainly hope to make good time and end up at Neal's Gap or a little farther.It will be several days before I have enough signal to update the blog but hang in there I'll add more as soon as I can.Until then...","Cooper's Gap

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557212,"After our slack pack day we had Richard give us one more ride back to Woody Gap and started to hike with all of our gear again. This would be a lot easier if we didn't have to carry all that weight but that's what makes it a challenge.Today was our first double digit day, hiking just under 12 miles. Eventually we have to average 12 miles to get done while it's still reasonably warm up north, so we have some making up to do on the mileage.The trip to Bull Gap goes over Blood Mountain, I think our tallest mountain to cross in Georgia. The way up was tough and long with ice still covering parts of the trail. The way down was rockier. The ice had melted on that side of the mountain but the melting created a lot of mud. John and I both had 'sit down' falls scrambling down through the rocks. But all is well so far.Until then...","Woody Gap

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557214,"We hit another double digit day today doing just over 10 miles. We're hoping our trail legs are starting to develop and that within in a week or so we can push the mileage a bit farther.We found our first trail magic today which was a surprise and delight. We came down off a mountain into Tesnatee Gap and met Bobby from Blairsville. Bobby was serving hot drinks and hot chicken soup with lots of noodles and vegetables added in. The trail angels are people who choose to come up to the gaps with food and refreshment motivated only by the goodness of their hearts. The hikers are truly appreciative because it certainly lifts spirits.A little down the trail we came across another trail angel with the trail name Lionheart who had fruit, snacks and drinks. We also met a ridgerunner named Davis who gave us a little insight into the trail ahead.Our destination was Low Gap shelter and when we got there it was already a tent city. Other hikers estimated the number of hikers at about 100 but I think it was more like 60 - either way it was crowded. The bear bag cables had eight to ten per cable which made pulling up the bags a little bit of a chore.John and I are almost always one of the last into a shelter area because our walking speed. Most of the people on the trail with us are young people either between jobs or fresh out of school. There are some other 'geezers' we meet but it seems that most them are faster than us. But we just keep plodding along.Until then...","Bull Gap

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557215,"We were one of the first to leave Low Gap which is common to us. The younger people tend to stay up later and then sleep later. (They still catch us the next day because they're so much faster!)Our plan was to push to the top of Rocky Mountain today so that we would not have two long climbs tomorrow. It was slow going up the mountain but we made it. There is a camping area in the trees at the summit and we set up camp with about six or eight other young people. After dinner the younger group built a campfire and we all gathered around for some fun conversation. This was the first night that John and I began to experience the 'trail family' phenomenon. People who hike the trail talk about developing your trail family among those you encounter day after day. It certainly seems true and it also seems it will make the long walk all the more enjoyable.Had more trail magic today with a burger, dogs and brats cookout at Unicoi Gap at the bottom of Rocky Mountain. I went for the burger with pickles and onions and a wonderful leftover St. Paddy Day's cupcake. Trail magic is always a treat it seems.Until then...","Low Gap Shelter

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557216,"Today was our longest day - in hours, not miles. This is the fourth straight day we've hiked and we are certainly tired. We had to come over Tray Mountain today. Tray is a long constant up near the beginning of the day. Because of its location not many people were spending the night there, although many gathered for a snack or lunch. the Tray Mountain Shelter would have been our first opportunity to sleep in a shelter instead in the tent cities but it would have meant about a four mile day.We decided to push on to Deep Gap Shelter but we ran out of gas about three miles short. Had we made it Deep Gap it would have been our first day over 12 miles but we reached Addis Gap late and tired and ended up setting up our tents just off the trail before the last mountain before Deep Gap. We cooked a quick dinner and went to our tents early. I have to admit we were bonked. I think hiking five straight days may be our limit. The longer we go the harder the climbs.

We left early, an hour before the sun came up, because we wanted to make sure to catch the 11:30 shuttle into town.On the way down we were passed by a fair number of the younger folks we stayed with on top of Rocky Mountain. They had all made it to Deep Gap Shelter, our original goal, but left much later in the morning than we did.We made it down the last mountain before 11 and the 11:30 shuttle showed up about 11:45 (which is a common time frame in these parts - 'trail time' I guess). We cold have slept another half an hour and had time to spare!We taking a zero day tomorrow in Hiawassee so there probably won't be a blog post. The zero day is a great time to restock our food supply, eat some hot meals and catch up on phone calls and the blog. We're hoping to use a good part of it for relaxing and napping as well.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557897,"Today was our first milestone as we crossed from Georgia into North Carolina just before Bly Gap. The border was marked by a sign tacked to a tree in the middle of the forest. The weather is still a little cold but the walk through the day was pleasant.We stopped today at Bly Gap, the site of what's called 'the most photographed tree on the trail.' The tree is a bent and crooked old oak and literally sits in the middle of the trail as you leave Bly Gap camping area. If you want to see the tree, my perfunctory photo is in the photo section.The day was uneventful until just after dinner when we had a bit of misfortune. I have to take all the blame and I'm just sick at the outcome. As we were cleaning up from dinner I rose from my perch on a log, stumbled a bit and unfortunately knocked right into John. John went down hard over the log and landed on his shoulder and he's in a lot of pain.We're going to try to hike tomorrow but I'm very concerned about John's shoulder, given the pain he has.Up until now we've been very fortunate on the trail. But this turn of luck is a little concerning. Two nights earlier we chose to go into town and, without knowing the forecast, sat out our first really bad storm in the comfort of a motel room.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557898,"Our intent in this section was to do four nights and then go back into town for a resupply on the fifth day but our concerns played out regarding John's shoulder. He toughed it out for about seven miles until we could get to a gap near a road. We called Miss Beverly, one of the wonderful volunteer shuttle drivers, and we went into town. John stopped at the Urgent Care while I found a hotel room for the two of us.The diagnosis is not too bad - nothing broken or dislocated, but significant resuction in range of motion - but we thought best that a long break was in order. We decided we would shut down for the next four days to give John's shoulder a chance to heal.Miss Beverly, the shuttle driver, has become our personal driver and tour guide and has taken great care of us. We are exceptionally grateful for these volunteers. I can't imagine doing the trail without these angles to help us on and off the trail.Tomorrow will be a zero day for both of us so there will be no post.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557899,We had plenty of time to think through our strategy during yesterday's off day and we decided that it would be best for me to do some slackpacking for a couple of sections so that we can stay reasonably close to our original schedule. So today I'm back to the trail to cover 13 miles.The slackpack includes only enough food and gear to get me through the day and with all that weight off my back I can make much better time. It rained for about half an hour after lunch and I walked in the clouds and fog all day. It was a litte concerning that I couldn't see more than about 40 yards down the trail because of the fog but I just kept moving and in the mid-afternoon the sun finally came out for a bit.The shuttle met me a little late but I made it back into town for dinner at the BBQ place near our hotel.

",Mooney Gap,"Mar 26, Sun",13
Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557901,"Today was my second day of slackpacking with a scheduled 11.4 miles. I got a late start because of the heavy burden of travelers on the shuttle drivers but it made for a very pleasant start to the day - warm and sunny.Today's challenge was up and over Mt. Albert. It's known for its tough climb near the top where it becomes a large pile of boulders that in parts require short spurts of vertical climbing up through the rocks. I was glad I didn't have my full pack as I made my way up through the rocks.I have to admit that I wimped out originally and decided to find the Mt. Albert bypass trail to avoid the rocks and the steep climb but I didn't trust my directions to the other trail, got a little confused and figured it would be safer just to go over the top. In the end it was worth the extra effort. The climb peaks out at an old fire lookout tower and some great views to the east.I started the day with a young man who came off the trail with us several days earlier. The young man had been hiking the trail with little gear and clothing, packing all his gear into a couple small duffel bags. In the time we were down, Miss Beverly had arranged for several donations, including a pack, a sleeping bag to replace the blanket he was sleeping in, more suitable clothes and some other gear to help him along the way. I stayed with him for about the first mile but then he took a break while I kept walking and I didn't see him the rest of the day. We're scheduling one more day off tomorrow for one last day of rest for John's shoulder and then we'll move on. I'm sure we'll see the young man again during that stretch.Tomorrow we start a three day hike to the Nantahalla Outdoor Center, one of the landmarks on the trail.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558772,"After a final zero day yesterday, today is our first test of John's shoulder and we started the day off with a free breakfast of pancakes and bacon at the First Baptist Church of Franklin. This is a ministry they started ten years ago and provides a good ht, free breakfast to any hikers who show up. We enjoyed the pancakes and the fellowship of like minded hikers and church members. At the breakfast a church member takes a picture of each hiker and provides the picture and an envelope with note paper to send home. I jotted a quick note to Linda and hope she'll be surprised.The walk was pretty uneventful and John's shoulder seemed to be OK. We were one of the first to reach the shelter and with room aplenty we moved in. This will be our first night sleeping in a shelter and it will save us the time and trouble of pitching and packing tents. We should be able to get out a little earlier in the morning.We walked through miles of burned out forest with all the undergrowth and many small trees burned away. Larger trees survived the fires from last year but the fire damage extends over miles and miles of the forest.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558775,"Today was a sad day. After a very bad night with his shoulder John thought it best that he leave the trail, return home to see his doctor and understand the extent of his shoulder injury. We hiked to the first Forest Service access road and called Beverly, our favorite volunteer shuttle driver, to take John back to Franklin.It's hard to convey how hard that decision was to make for John. Three years of talking and planning and for now the adventure is over - until he can figure out whether his shoulder can be rehabbed enough to return to the trail.I decided to go on, although I have to say I was somewhat conflicted about the trip at this point. I walked through the day and made pretty good time. We had intended to stop at Wesser Bald Gap Shelter but I hit there a little after 1:30 and decided to just keep hiking. Before the day was over I made it to Nantahala Outdoor Center, a multi-use outdoor sports facility near Wesser, NC. I found room in one of their bunkrooms and spent a fitful night after a quick dinner and what turned out to be an ice cold shower.By Thursday morning I had decided to leave the trail and made preparations to return to Franklin. Like John, I found the decision to be very hard but for the present time I have to say my heart wasn't in the walk. I returned to Franklin and made plans to rent a car for the drive home.A funny thing happened, however. The longer I was away from the trail the more I wanted to be back out there. In the end I decided I'd go home for a week, spend some time with John to see that he's on the road to recovery, talk through any plans for him to return, catch up on things at home, resupply, change out some gear and I committed to being back on the trail Friday morning, April 7.I apologize for the long time it took for me to update the blog but I had to think through everything to make sure I'm making the right decision. As it stands now I'll be driving back to the NOC on Thursday and plan to start walking early Friday morning. Linda has been supportive and agreed to drive me back and I""m certainly grateful for her understanding.My next post will come sometime after Friday, probably at my next stop in a town where I'll have access to a computer. Again, forgive my uncertainty over the last week but it looks now like I'll be back at it and make myself proud - at least for the near term.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559934,"Sorry for the long delay but I quit blogging while I went home to reconsider my fate on the trail. But this morning I am back at it. My lovely bride Linda drove me back and helped me get an early start.The day started with a long climb out of the Nantahala Outdoor Center - up Sassafras Mountain. I had another piece of great fortune. I'd been watching the weather all week and a pretty good storm was forecast for today. But the storm had come through the day before - so for the third time I weathered out a storm in a warm hotel room.Not far up the mountain I ran into the snow on the ground, plenty of cold and with howling winds (they literally howled through the trees and up the mountain). The total snowfall was about two to three inches and I tromped through fresh snow for several hours. At the top of the mountain there were places where the snow had drifted to eight to ten inches. But I just made my way through - with toes as cold as they've been for quite some time.I met Grey Beard today. He's 81 right now and if he finishes in Maine he'll be 82 and officially the oldest person to complete the Appalachian Trail. I left him behind near the top of the mountain but he passed me half way down which caused me some reflection and great consternation that the 81 year old is hiking faster than me. Good luck to Grey Beard!I thought after a week off that my legs would be rested and strong but the almost 16 mile day turned out to be a little too much. I struggled into the shelter a little late and resolved to cut back my mileage a bit until I'm certain my legs have 15-16 mile days in them.Until then...","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559935,"My goal today is to make the Fontana Dam Shelter - a famous spot on the trail. The Shelter is called the Fontana Hilton because it is the most luxurious shelter on the trail. It includes the usual shelter structure but it sits in a very commercial area near the Fontana Dam Visitor Center and has a heated bathroom with an actual shower! And the shower had plenty of hot water. It also has benches, tables and other comforts of home.But it's also a haven for the young folk - and their beer and their marijuana. I know I'm an old curmudgeon, but I (along with several other curmudgeons)went to bed early with the intent to get out early the next morning. The partying went late and several hikers got really drunk - and sick. I actually witnessed a drunken argument between two young men about what an ounce of weed SHOULD cost.One person rolled out of the upper bunk in the middle of the night - the bathroom was sprayed with someone's. All said it was a little bit of a slap in the face to what I think of as the culture and traditions of the hike - but that's just me being an old curmudgeon.So now I can say that I've stayed in the famous Fontana Hilton, but I'm pretty sure it won't ever happen again.I was able to hop on the shuttle early in the evening and go to the Fontana Lodge and have a sandwich and a Diet Coke for dinner. It's always good when someone else fixes your dinner.I did meet one very interesting young man who showed up in the Fontana parking area, asked me whether he could leave his car there while he walked to Maine. I said why not and he and his girlfriend unloaded a very large dog, about 100 pounds of gear and a rifle! He said he woke up one morning a little ways back and decided to hike the Appalachian Trail. He said his plan is to live off the land and ""do it like in the old days.""I didn't have the heart to tell him that the Great Smoky Mountain National Park prohibits dogs and firearms - I figured he would just have to learn that on his own. I wish him well but I think I need to get out ahead of the guy - at least out of range of that rifle.Until then...","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559937,"I left the shelter as early as I could and hit the best part of the trail - a flat, wide dam that forms Fontana Lake. I say it's the best part because there are no rocks, no tree routes and the dam is absolutely flat - I could actually walk at a brisk pace without looking down at my feet!The walk in this area is beautiful as you traverse the lake for a couple of miles. For most of the day we (I always think 'we' because you end up walking with other people pretty much every day) had views of the lake for miles up the mountain. The sun was bright today and for the second time I was able to get down to my T-shirt.The wildflowers are coming out and in places they just cover the landscape - it's one of the treats of hiking in the mountains in the spring time. The day was short, in terms of miles, but long because it was an all day climb up from the lake towards Clingman's Dome. The Dome is the high point of the AT at about 6600 feet and I'll be climbing toward it for the next couple of days.Near the top of the climb I met a Ridge Runner - these are employees (some are volunteers) of the AT Conservancy who roam the trail making sure everyone is good. He said that a virus was circulating and to make sure you tended to your hand hygiene as you traveled. I had caught up with our old friends Taylor and Kurt that morning and they said they shut down for three days at the Fontana Lodge because Taylor had some sort of stomach virus. Other hikers told stories at the Shelter about friends who had to shut down for a few days so the stomach virus story seemed real.I stayed in the Shelter tonight for the fourth time in a row but resolved to sleep in my tent for the near future until word of the stomach virus went away.The walk was strenuous but beautiful. It feels like it's finally Spring with much warmer temps both day and night.Today is the first of what will be about six days in the Smokies. The Smokies are the last big mountain range for a long time and I'll be glad to get out of them. there are big mountains ahead but they are stand alone and not like the ranges where you spend every day going up and down ranging from 3000 to 6000 feet.

A long slow walk of ups and downs, but mostly up, as we approached the 6000 foot mark for the first time.I can't say that anything from the day stands out in my mind other than I caught up with DR, an excavator from Massachusetts. He's a hoot and I really enjoy spending my hiking time with him. He's full of stories and really appreciates life. He is a walking billboard for the 'Life is Good' philosophy although he always grousing about something in a light-hearted way. It's this kind of encounter that makes the trip all the more special. DR is someone I would have never met if not for the trail.Sleeping in a tent tonight to protect myself from viruses and I also seem to sleep better in the tent than in the crowded and noisy shelters.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559940,"Today's the day to go over the high point of the Appalachian Trail. Clingman's Dome is the highest point on the trail and the second highest point east of the Mississippi River.I shouldn't say this but with the two prior days of climbing this day seemed a little easy. I made it to the top much faster than I thought I would, took some time at the top to stop at the Gift Store for a candy bar and a comfortable rest. The trail comes close to the top of the dome, near the observation tower, and I forgot that it's a good quarter mile down the mountain to the gift store (which means a 1/4 mile back up, of course), but the chocolate was calling! I left my pack at the top, tucked under a tree and walked down to the store for a couple of candy bars.One treat of the walk to the top was the old growth hemlock forests we walked through. The smell from the trees and the dense shade made for a wonderful walk up the mountain. The moss grows so thick on the trees that you can actually describe them as shaggy. Overall I have to say today was the best day on the trail. Warm sun and blue skies and the biggest climb is now behind me. I finally unzipped the bottom of my zip-off pants and walk in my shorts for the first time. I've heard that a time comes on the trail when you finally start to feel the experience as normal and I think I've hit that part. For the first time today I started to seriously think about Maine, but I don't want to jinx anything so I'll say I'm still going one day at a time and I'll see what tomorrow brings.Tonight in the tent and tomorrow in a hotel in Gatlingburg (yeah!!!)Until then...","Derrick's Knob Shelter

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559942,"Got up early this morning with a short walk (4.3 miles) down to the Gap. And after that we hitch hike into Gatlingburg for a zero day tomorrow.As luck would have it just as we (I was walking with 'Grateful' today) walked into the Gap we saw a car with a couple of hikers pull up. A conversation ensued as the other hikers got ready to hike on from the Gap and before long a nice lady (I've forgotten her name already!!) from Toledo, OH offered to drive us into town. We are always grateful for the generosity of others on the trail and it seems to happen regularly which I think is testimony to the goodness around us all the time.I had leap-frogged with Grateful for the last couple of days and today we decided to walk out together. During one of our breaks we talked about his trail name and he explained that he had retired just a little ways back and he aspired to walk the trail for decades. He chose the name Grateful as his trail name because it aptly describes his approach to the trail and where he is in life. He mentioned that I hadn't picked up a trail name yet and I told him that I was waiting for an inspirational moment to see what feels right.I shared with him that one lady I walked with for a few days suggested I take the name Mr. Magoo because I remind her of the cartoon character. I cannot at all fathom how I remind someone of Mr. Magoo but I smiled at her and said I would consider it. If someone out there can give me any insights into how I can remind someone of Mr. Magoo I would certainly be interested in hearing it. (I also want to share that a lady walking with her offered that maybe I could meet up with someone named Wimpy - you know, the guy who will pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today - and we could team up again. I wanted to let her know that she has her cartoon characters a little mixed up but I didn't.)Grateful said I didn't remind him of Mr. Magoo but that when he met me and watched me hike the last several days he noted that although I walk slower, I always show up sooner or later and he offered that I should call myself Persistent. The moment seemed right and I shared with him that persistence is one of my mantras - I believe that success comes mostly through persistence, not necessarily through talent or knowledge or any of those other things we are taught. So I thanked Grateful for the name and said I'll introduce myself as 'Persistent' from now on. I'm grateful for Grateful.Tomorrow will be a zero day in Gatlinburg - a resupply day, a chance to get caught up on baseball standings and a day to rest my legs.

They do this as a mission to support the AT thru-hikers. When we got back to Newfound Gap they also had some tables set up with fruit, snacks, drinks and other trail magic. It certainly was appreciated.We're half way through the Smoky Mountain National Park and so far the weather has been great. Today looks like it might be the best weather of the hike.No tough climbs today and the day seemed a bit easier than the last week or so. Some trail veterans told us that things would get easier after Newfound Gap and for this day I think it's true.There were still about 15 people at the shelter in the evening which seems like a lot this far into the hike. The trail seems almost crowded at places, which is good for the fellowship but bad when you're hunting for a flat spot to pitch a tent.I've pretty much made up my mind to forego the shelters and pitch a tent every night. It's quieter and you don't have the problems with mice and other contagious vectors (humans).Tonight should be the warmest night in the tent so far.Until then...","Newfound Gap

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560744,"The highlight today was crossing the 10% mark. We did it early in the day and t about 220 miles it feels like a long way. But I'll have to pick up the miles soon or I'll never get done in time!Yesterday coming out of Newfound Gap, just in case you get a little over-confident, the Park Service has posted a sign reminding you that you only have 1976 miles to go to get to your goal in Maine. Thanks for that!!Today is the last full day in the Smoky Mountain National Park and that's a good thing. The Park has very strict rules about camping only at shelter sites which fixes the length of your day so it's hard to make up time without doing really, really long days. But tomorrow we walk out.This shelter seems like quite a bottleneck as everyone tries to get here so that tomorrow they can walk out of the Park. I didn't count exactly but I'm guessing there were about 40 people at the shelter and in the small tent city that formed around it. These days always have a side benefit because you typically meet old friends - people you hiked with for a day or two and because of the luck of good timing you meet up with them again. That's what creates the sense of community on the Trail and it's one of the best parts of the experience.We're still seeing fire damage from the fires last year but we'll leave that behind in a day or two.One benefit of staying at the shelters is that you get the use of a privy. I much prefer privies over the 'dig a hole in the woods somewhere' method and I've been lucky with my timing for the most part. Privies are pretty primitive, but they do provide peceful plce to sit and ponder why in the heck you're spending all your time tromping around a forest. I'll try to upload a picture of one if I can.We spent most of today between 5000 to 6000 feet but the sun was out, strong and warm. For the first day I hiked in my shorts and t-shirt only.We've been in the Smokies for five days now and not a single drop of rain. And I'm thankful for that.Until then....","Peck's Corner Shelter

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560745,"Today was another short day down and out of the National Park and we were glad to leave it behind. The climbs on the upside were a challenge and the placement of the shelters limited our chances at trimming a day. The crowds at the shelters created some challenges but also brought many benefits. Trail veterans tell us that getting through the Smokies is a signficant landmark on the way and that people who walk out still in good shape are likely to finish the entire trip. Let's hope so!We walked out of the Park and down to the I-40 underpass. I've driven over this point many times in my life and at the big brown sign announcing that you are passing over the Appalachian Trail I always strain to see the trail and never do. But I often thought that someday I would see it from below. And indeed that happened today.From there we walked on to Standing Bear Hostel, including a section of the trail that was prolific with poison ivy. We stepped carefully through that part and I'm hoping I didn't inadvertently walk through any.Standing Bear is a unique spot. Grateful and I opted for the $25 option which gave us a private room for two. Everyone else bunked in the big dormitory for $20 and we thought we got the bargain. No plumbing at the hostel - just a privy and some porta-potties. We were instructed to do number one in the porta-pottie and number two in the privy because the moisture slows down the decomposition process in the privy. Who knew hiking would be so technical! (I might have cheated a bit - but don't tell them).They also offered a unique kind of hospitality - it involved getting yelled a lot for breaking some unknown rule and threats of charging double if we didn't follow all these unknown rules. AND! The hostel is best described as being on the rustic side of very rustic. A good scrubbing down might cause the place to crumble away to dust! But the bed got us through the night.And on this Easter Day we were blessed with a proper Easter dinner prepared by some of the staff at the hostel. Late in the evening they announced that an Easter dinner was on its way. It was a little odd because almost everyone had eaten already but when the food arrived everyone, including me, lined up too eat again. We sat in the last light of the day eating ham, green bean casserole, baked beans, mashed potatoes, fruit, and some left over cake from a previous birthday party. It was wonderful and one of the unexpected and special moments that happens on the trail. So,I have to say that I'm thankful for Standing Bear Hostel.Until then....","Cosby Knob Shelter

We've got to start doing more of these days to have any chance of making Katahdin before it closes for the season. My early troubles on the trail and my week off have moved my finish from about September 15 to early October and if it snows in Baxter State Park in October they will close Mount Katahdin - the official terminus of the AT.Our schedule today took us up and over Snowbird Mountain - a pretty good climb of a couple thousand feet. The top of the mountain is a beautiful grassy bald with a UFO Docking Station right on top. I have to say that the UFO people are pretty smart to build their docking station here because it's in the middle of nowhere and we won't even know they have arrived util it's too late. (Some other hikers told me that the docking station is really an FAA navigational beacon but I think those people are really UFO people in disguise. I tried to keep a close eye on them.)The next highlight was Max Patch Bald, a popular day hiking area with a grassy bald that seemed to reach half a mile in every direction. And someone had left trail magic on top of the bald - a trash bag full of ice and cold drinks. I dug around in the bag and found one Fresca - one of my very favorites. It was as if they knew I was coming. And a little delight like that in the middle of nowhere is certainly magical!The weather held out and we had a warm, dry day of hiking.

So everything is wet or damp but that's how it is in the forest. The worst part was coming over Walnut Mountain and into the face of some significant wind. We started wet and not we're wet and cold but we just layer up and walk through it. A wet day on the trail seems still like a good day on the trail.We've settled into a bubble of about 12 to 15 familiar faces, although we get passed by people who move much faster and then seem gone forever. And to my delight when I reached the shelter I caught up to three ladies I walked with in the early days of the Smokies. It was good to see them (although one of them was the nice lady who thought my trail name should be Mr. Magoo - I'm still searching for some self awareness of how I can give off that persona - any help would be appreciated.We have seen abundant wildflowers and Grateful is a bit of an expert on wildflowers so I've been learning about the three kinds of trilliums, the Spring Beauties, two kinds of anemones, the Rattlesnake Lilly, the Trout Lilly, and something he calls Dutchman's Britches, among several other kinds of flowers. It's nice to learn a little about all these wonderful flowers we see everywhere but sometimes I wish he'd talk a little faster while it's raining. I taught him about the May Apple which is abundant back in my Indiana home, and, apparently, abundant on the Trail.
As we crossed Max Patch yesterday my phone froze up on me while taking pictures and then when it came back to life it had done a factory reset - it's an old phone that I repurposed for this hike but it was disappointing to lose everything on the phone. I have no contact information including phone numbers, and all the pictures I've been taking are gone so i'm not able to post them to the journal.

The trail goes down Main Street of Hot Springs and it's a great place to stay. Our first stop was at the Smoky Mountain Diner and I had the Classic Breakfast - three eggs, ham, hash browns and biscuits and gravy. It sounds like a lot but it wasn't. Maybe a burger for lunch - who knows.These small trail towns are very welcoming to the AT hikers and the Diner was filled this morning with hikers just in off the trail, those who had stayed the night before and those who chose to take a zero and stay two nights. We met again a number of hikers who had moved ahead of us and that's always a fun way to start the day - sharing stories with people you've met along the way.We're in Hot Springs only for the day to catch up on chores like laundry, resupply of food, mailing stuff home that is no longer needed and most importantly personal hygiene.

At that point the river is wide and looks more like a lake but at Hot Springs it's a very different kind of river. At this point it seems more of an adventure river with some rapids and boulders in the middle of the river. I was told that this section is used a lot by rafters and kayakers.We had two snake surprises today. Grateful was walking up front and both times he let out of big whoop of surprise. I noted to myself both times that my training has really taken hold because in both cases I immediately dropped down into my prepare to flee quickly stance.In the first case there was a big black snake, maybe rat snake, maybe something else, stretched across the trail. After a bit of a standoff it decided to move on. Later we crossed a small garter snake which still caused Grateful to let out a pretty big holler. But as I said before in both cases I was ready to hightail it in the opposite direction.At the end of the day we decided to stretch the day another 1.2 miles and stayed at a camping area by ourselves. I'm not keeping up too strong a pace and at the current rate I'm not going to finish until sometime in October which puts the final walk into Katahdin a little in jeopardy. If the snows come early Baxter State Park will close access to Katahdin and I won't be able to finish the hike.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561642,"We had an interesting day including mileage that put me ahead of my goal. The rain started today and we walked in a steady downpour for several hours. Thunder and lightning followed us all along the trail.Near the end of the hike we had the choice of going over what was described as an exposed ridge which is 'rocky and treacherous' or taking the bad weather bypass. I wimped out and took the bypass because although I'll do rocky or treacherous I won't do them at the same time in a thunderstorm. The bypass was pretty level and skirted the top of the mountain.It turns out there are three ways to climb a mountain. We do a lot of ridge climbing to get up mountains. Ridge climbing is the worst kind because you literally walk up the spine of the mountain and it's generally steep and straight up. Another way is to approach the mountain through a series of easy grade switchbacks.   This is much better because although the mountain might be steep the switchbacks are usually cut at an acceptable grade. But the best way is when you find the switchbacks and then at the top the trail skirts around the top so you don't have to climb as high. These are my favorites climbs. The bad weather trail skirted the mountain top which allowed us to avoid any danger and to have a pretty pleasant walk up the mountain.The rain broke at the end of the day just long enough to set up the tent and to cook some dinner but almost as soon as I climbed into the tent it started to rain. The all day rain made the pack even heavier with all the water that it soaked up.

Grateful lives a few miles off the trail so it wasn't without some inconvenience that she came but she was able to pick us up off the trail at about 7 p.m. and deliver us back to Grateful's home where we planned tow wait out the rain. And it was a good thing because it did indeed rain all day long on Sunday - what turned out to be a zero day two days sooner than expected.We used Sunday to rig up Grateful's pickup truck with a camper top and a couple of foam mattresses so we could plan on some slackpacking for a few days. It turns out that the trail around Erwin, TN has many parking areas spaced far enough apart so that we could plan several days of hiking with our heavy packs off. What we planned to do was to drop one hiker at one parking area, drive to the other and have the second hiker walk back to the original drop off place. This will allow the first hiker to reach the truck and drive back at the end of the day to pick up the other hiker.

Most sightings have been from a distance and no one seems any worse for the encounters at this point.This morning pretty early in the walk I rounded a bend and had a big surprise. Just off to the left of the trail was a small pine tree of some sort all decked out with Christmas bulbs and other decorations. A couple of months before I started hiking I read of a small group of young people who go out into the woods and decorate a tree as a memorial to someone. They don't identify where the trees are and they don't expect any return for their work but I hope that my delight in seeing the AT Christmas Tree serves as a statement of gratitude for what they do. This tree was dedicated to the memory of Max Norrell. I'll have to go online to learn more about Max. There are other trees that have been decorated - not all of them on the AT but I'm hopeful I'll find more.My second surprise of the day came late in the walk when I rounded the corner of a summit traverse and found a small crew of volunteers working on the trail. I've done a little bit of volunteer work on the Ozark Trail so I know how hard the work is. It was great to see their energy and focus and you could tell they enjoyed the work and one another's company. I thanked them for the work they do and received many smiles in return.

The evening before did provide some excitement.  One of our tasks each day is to find a place to park the truck each night.  We look for public land parking areas and last night we had a little trouble.  We parked in a pull off that appeared to be in the national forest but shortly after stopping and man on a four wheeler pulled up right next to the truck and just glared at us.  I asked if I could help him but he just kept glaring and racing the engine on his four wheeler.  Needless to say we agreed that we didn't feel comfortable where we were, so we moved on.  About a quarter mile down the road we saw the four wheeler guy again and he gave us an exaggerated salute - message taken!
We then next went to a Baptist church nearby and spoke with the church's deacon about parking in their lot.  He said we were selcome but didn't recommend it because there had been a history of slashed tires and broken windows for hikers in the area.  He even shared with us a story about local roughnecks who burned his church down (""not even the FBI could figure out who did it"").  So off we went to Mountain Harbor hostel where we paid $10 to park in their lot.  They threw in a shower for each of us and we felt much safer - and cleaner.
We knew some of the logistics with our shelter on wheels would be difficult but we knew if we just keep at it we could figure it out.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563003,"Grateful and I knew that every once in a while we would have to put on our big packs and spend a night on the trail because the gaps between parking areas and trailheads would be too great.  Today was our first day with full packs on after five days of slackpacking.  And it turned out to be the worst day on the trail.
The evening before we found Dividing Ridge Hostel, a tenting only hostel not far from our two day destination of lake Watugua.  The onwer volunteered to drive us both back to US 19 so we could hike together instead of from our usual opposite directions - and that turned out to be a good thing.
The day started like any other and we had a great walk along the beautiful Elk River, bumping into old friends and stopping occasionally for a great picture.  We even hit some great trail magic, with hot dogs, hamburgers, cold pop, cookies and a few other goodies.  13 Year old Zachary was our host and he was a confident, generous and congenial young man any parent could be proud of.
But shortly after leaving the trail magic, probably another mile to two after, Grateful took a fall and came up with pretty bad facila lacertaions and what looked like a broken nose.  Like most head wounds there was blood everywhere and as I cam up from about 100 to 150 yeards from behind I was shocked to see his state.  We cleaned him up as best as we could and worked through options before he and I walked back to the last forest service road we saw. Fortune smiled on us and we found a family that was out mushroom hunting and the father offered to drive Grateful to the hospital.  We retrieved his pack and when I saw he was in good hands I continued on the trail walking to toward the truck.  My intent was to get to the truck and search for Grateful the next day because I was pretty sure he would be spending the night in the hospital.  
All I can say is that I thought about Grateful a lot that night, hoping that the damage was not as bad as it looked.","US 19

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563005,"I walked as quickly as I could to get to the truck , thinking I would have to find Grateful and see where we needed to be that night.  I rolled into Lake Watagua a little later than expected and when I got there and found cell service I read a text from Grateful telling me he was back at the hostel and waiting for me.
The good news was that the damage from the fall was not as bad as I was expecting.  A broken nose but no other  facial fractures and no concussion.  But it was clear that Grateful was not able to pick up the pack and hike on at this point.  After an evening together he let me know that he was heading back home to recover and he would think about whether he wanted to continue.  It's painful to see someone have to leave the trail due to injury or accident because I know that Grateful was committed to the trip and I enjoyed his experience,wisdom, stories and his company.
The walk included a few highlights, including Laurel Falls. I had visited the Falls several years ago in the middle of summer and the falls was a lazy flow of water over a 40 or so foot cascade.  today it was raging as all the rain of the last week or so was forcing its way down through the falls.  It was a beautiful site and I even saw a couple hikers take a swim - can't imagine how cold that water must have been.","Moreland Gap Shelter

My original schedule is to take three reasonable days to walk to Damascus where Linda is planning to meet me.  I'm looking forward to that and it made today's lonely walk a little easier to handle.  I walked alone almost all day, passing and being passed by others I've met along the way.  The first few hours of the hike took me around Lake Watagua and I had views of the lake form several perspectives all the way up the mountain.
Late in the day I caught up with Olive and Sparks, a couple of hikers I had met several days before at Beauty Spot Gap.  They were at Iron Mountain Shelter, my planned stopover for the night, but there was plenty of day and daylight left.  We talked a little about Grateful and then they invited me to walk on with them.  Today turned out to be my longest mileage day, 19.7 miles, largely due to relatively flat terrain after the morning climb up from lake Watagua.  We went pretty late - well after 6:00 p.m. - and finally found a good spot along the trail for the night.  another hiker joined us and the four of us spent the night at a campsite well past Iron Mountain Shelter.
Tomorrow will be over 22 miles into Damascus, but since Linda's not meeting me until Thursday I'll probably spend one more night on the trail.

",A Few Miles Beyond Iron Mountain Shelter,"May 02, Tue",19.70
Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563011,"Today turned out to be my longest distance for any single day and my first day over 20 miles, with a 20.2 mile day.  It's just a couple more miles to Damascus but then I'd have to find a place to rent for the night and staying short let's me stay for free.
Several others had the same idea I had and about a dozen people shared the small camping area just short of town.
Damascus is an important landmark on the trail.  It's the site of Trail Days, an annual hiking and Appalachian Trail festival held the third weekend in May, and it's the symbolic one quarter mark.  It's not the actual quarter pole but it's within a several day hike.  My personal feeling is that reaching Damascus is an important accomplishment - almost a fourth of the way there and prrof that you can stay on the trail for weeks on end.
First thing in the morning the trail took me trough a literal cow pasture, with cows grazing around the trail to my left and right.  I gave them a wide berth - not because I'm afraid of cows but because, well, you never know....  As I was walking I thought maybe I'd change my trail name from Persistent to Dances with Cows, but I""m not sure that one will take.
Later in the day I passed a pretty meager shelter, named by the guidebook as ""an unused shelter.""  It looked unused, although I used it to sit down and eat my lunch.  It was a pretty poor shelter, that I'm sure for a while in its past served hikers well, but I was glad I didn't have to sleep there tonight.  I'll try to include a picture if you're interest in seeing it.
Twenty miles is another milestone for me.  Experienced trail hikers say that eventually you'll start doing the 20 mile days, especially as the trail flattens a bit, so today made me feel like I'm getting strong and the miles might peal off a little easier - after all, there's only a little more than 1700 miles to go.
The other highlight today was crossing from Tennessee into Virginia.  For the last few weeks we've been crossng back and forth from North Carolina to Tennessee. I left North Carolina for the last time at Doll Flats during the hike out of Carver's Gap and today I left Tennessee for the last time.  Leaving Tennessee is a good think because they don't provide privies at their shelters like the other states have.  I much prefer a privy over taking a long walk into the woods with your hand shovel and some toilet paper.  And it's also good to put the big mountains behind me.

The day was cold and soon after leaving Damascus the rain started. The rain stayed all the way to the shelter and continued through the night. It was the first time I had to set up the tent in the rain so I was rushing to get the rain fly on before the inside of the tent got too wet.
When I got to the shelter there was a crowd of Hikers huddled under the edges of the shelter trying to stay dry and warm, waiting to see if we could get a break from the rain. But no break came.
(Whining alert) I spent a good part of the day thinking about why I am out here. There's not a good answer to that when you're wet and cold all day long.

White Top Mountain was true to its name with a covering of snow on the ground and trees.Temps were in the high 30s and low 40s all day (when I woke up the thermometer on my pack said 36). And the winds blew so hard that it staggered you as you walked.  It wasn't much of a day to recover from the soaking yesterday. The highlight of the highlands are the wild pony herds.  I was walking with a couple other guys and we came to the ponies soon after entering the Highlands.  The first two we saw had foal, one had two little baby ponies cute as could be. There was trail magic first thing in the morning and I had a big cup of hot coffee right on the trail - a real treat and a chance to warm up a bit.Later in the day I was walking with a hiker I had met several weeks ago and as he walked he took a tumble and landed on his shoulder.  After tending to him I thought to myself COME ON!

It's these kind of days that renew the spirit and make the walk see an easy task.

I wanted to get close to Marion because I need resupply but don't want to take an entire day off.  If you stay close to town then it's possible to get in while it's still morning and have the better part of the day to finish errands.  So I kept pushing until it began to get dark - 23 miles and my longest day on the trail.

I set my alarm for 5 a.m. this morning hoping to get up and make a few miles before the rain came but even with the early start I spent the entire three hour walk in a pouring rain.  the trail was three inches of mud in places and after awhile all I could do was plod through.  Thankfully it was a short walk and I made it to the Visitor Center in time for a Coke and a candy bar while waiting for the shuttle.
I don't ever drink real Coke at home and seldom have a candy bar but on the trail there are no rules - everything you eat burns off pretty quickly so the sentiment among hikers is eat whatever you want - it won't last long.

I met Foggy yesterday and we had dinner together last night.  Foggy remembered me from Newfound Gap when I was hiking with Grateful, but I didn't remember him.  We started walking together when we got back to the trail and maybe we'll walk together for the near future.  It always depends on hiking speeds and distances before you can be sure that you have a hiking partner.  But it's good to have someone to hike with, both on the trail and in the evenings when you find a remote spot to camp.The 11 a.m. shuttle was completely full of hikers and they had to call a back up shuttle.

We climbed for the better part of the morning, ending up climbing about a mile and a half of high meadow up to a shelter.  The shelter was one of the nicer ones on the trail with four walls, windows and a front door that closed.  It would have been a great shelter to stay in had we not arrived around noon.
After a quick lunch we moved on and almost immediately the thunder and lightning and hard rains came.  For about three to four hours we walked on through the rain, a little worried about the lightning but with nothing we could do about it.
We knew the bad weather was coming so from the shelter we called down to a motel in Bland, VA to make sure we would have a dry spot for the night.  The motel staff told us to call Bubba when we got down to the road and we set off, at least hopeful that we would sleeping in a warm, dry spot.
We finally made it to VA 623, a dirt road mountain trail and called Bubba who told us he was rescuing others so it would an hour or so.  His advice was to start walking down the mountain road to stay warm and he get to us as quickly as he could.  So, off we went down the dirt road in the pouring rain.  But Bubba was true to his word and in about an hour he was there.  The shuttle fee was $40, a new personal record for me, but at that point I would have paid more (Don't tell Bubba that or the next poor, wet, shivering schmuck will get a bill for $60.)  Bubba was nice enough and got us into town as quickly as possible, even with a brief tour of the three or four places of business that exist in Bland, VA - a subway, a DQ, a Dollar General and a Kangaroo convenience store.

Today was another perfect hiking day - sunny and cook with temps in the 50s most of the day.  As the days get longer we can hike longer and to make up for our late start we hiked until 7:30 so we could meet our daily mileage target.  When we left from the trailhead we bumped into a few hikers we hadn't seen for awhile, including 'Bartender' who I had not seen since Mountain Harbor Hostel over a week ago.  That's the nature of the trail - people come in and out of your bubble from day to day.  It's always fun to see someone you haven't seen for a while, especially if you have the time to compare notes about the trail.
The privies in Virginia seem a step up from those in the other states we've walked through but I cam across one today that had tarp sides and no front to it.  It was well behind a shelter but it faced the shelter so the only thing protecting your modesty was distance and a few tress blocking the view from the shelter.  I'm sure there was a plan there but I'm not sure what it was.  You can be assured I tried to make quick work of my duties at the privy and move. on.

We had to climb down through the rocks for a couple of hours and parts got pretty hairy. There were sections we climbed down on ledges less than a foot wide and areas we had to sit and slide down. No fun and wet on top of it.Eventually we got down to the road and walked to a small grocery with a grill and had a burger while we waited fot the driver. We did pass the 700 mile mark which felt like an accomplishment.Not sure when we'll be back on the trail, but until then...","

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566452,We planned short day today hoping we will have plenty of time at McAfee's Knob. The knob is an iconic spot on the trail and worth a stop to take in the view of the Virginia farm lands. The mountains of Virginia are not as high as those farther south but the views are just as nice or better - when the weather let's you see them.First thing in the morning we had to ford our first stream. There were rocks and logs to try hopping across but the water was so high and fast Foggy and I didn't think we would stay dry.  After drying off our feet and putting socks and shoes back on several young hikers came by and quickly hopped across the rocks and logs. But I guess it's better safe than sorry.The climb to McAfee's was long but not steep. The skkes were partly sunny so we got great views and pictures.We stayed at the first shelter after the Knob and were the only ones there when we arrived. Before the evening was over it seemed like a whole troop of girl Scots arrived and it looked like tent city the next morning. I think our twozero days in Daleville allowed the Trail Day but blue to catchup to us. We saw a lot of hikers we hadn't seen before so we'll be walking in a new bubble for a while. I didn't sleep well that night because of the pain in my left hip. It's been bothering me from the start back in Georgia but last night was the worst.By the way I got a haircut in Daleville after three months and I feel a little more human now.," VA 624

We had just left the shelter area and about 75 to 100 yards ahead I spotted a bear running up the hill toward the trail. I didn't know what else to do so I shouted Bear and pointed. Foggy spotted him as well. After the bear ran off into the woods we proceeded carefully but saw no more sign of him.The walk was uneventful after the bear. We got some great views walking across Tinker Cliffs and while the sun was shining the wind picked up considerably. We were fortunate that tje wind blew in from the cliffs so we didn't have to worry a out being blown over the edge.Since we had already spent three nights Im a Daleville hotel we decided to camp just short of the town and walk in for dinner.

We celebrated a bit but I was in serious pain with my hip. We continued on for a total of 4 miles and I knew I couldn't keep going. After much thought and regret I had to turn back to Daleville. I said goodbye to Foggy and assured him I'll find a way to catch up if my hip comes around.The pain was pretty intense and seemed to getting worse and I'm worried that I might be doing some permanent damage.Walled back to tom and went directly to the Urgent Care facility just off the trail. After some X-rays and a visit with the doc Was told nothing damaged but I have a lot of arthritis in both hips. The doc told me that I won't do any more damage but I maynot be able to tolerate the pain for the entire trip.She advised a few days off and then suggested I give it another chance. So, I'm back at the hotel for 3 more days. My palm is to rest and relax and then I'll jump ahead to rejoin Foggy in Buena Vista.If the pain comes back, especially as and as it was yesterday I think I'll have to quit.  At this point I can only wait to see what happens.Until then...","US 220 Daleville

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566943,"I followed the physician's advice and haven't hiked since turning back to Daleville Saturday morning. Yesterday I moved ahead about 70 trail miles so that I can catch up with  and rejoin Foggy. I enjoy hiking with Foggy and I thought it was worth moving forward to get our schedules synced up again.Until this morning I was doubtful that my hip was going to recover enough but when I woke up it was much improved over yesterday. I'd estimate that it's at about 90 to 95 percent at this point. I spent yesterday icing the hip and following up with a heat pad I made by filling my water bladder with hot water. It seems to have done  the trick.  As a final test I decided to do a short slack pack to see if my hip would hold up on the trail. I tried 10 miles and my hip did great. I had a few twinges throughout the day but it felt strong.The ten miles took me past the 800 mile mark. Of course, I'm about 60 miles short of 800 miles but I'll plan to come back here after I finish in Maine and hike these 50 or 60 miles as my last test on the trail.The day was perfect for hiking - sunny and warm and the trail crossed and followed a small river for a long part of the day. About half way through the day I met up with Grey Beard and we hiked several miles together. Grey Beard is the 81 year old trying to become the oldest recognized through hiker. He's going strong and looks fit and several times he left me behind for a bit. But he rests a lot and I eventually catch up and ended the day before him. But enjoyed chatting with him and seeing that he's getting close to his quest. The last time I saw him was back in April two states ago.Just as I finished today the skies opened up. There was a small information shelter at the Trailhead and I stood there to stay warm and dry.  There was a collared dog at the Trailhead and he joined me in the dry shelter.  As I was waiting, contemplating calling the shuttle service another hiker came off the trail and offered me a ride back into town. I graciously accepted the offer and the dog tried to accept as well, trying to climb into the car with me. I'm not a dog thief so I closed the door quickly and left the poor thing sitting in the rain. I hope it had the good sense to go back to the little shelter but I'll never know.  My trail angel driver was a college chemistry professor from Kansas and we chatted a  bit about life in academia these days (not that I have a lot of experience there) and she delivered me back to Budget Inn at Buena Vista.  I plan to do another 10 mile slack pack tomorrow to test whether my hip can do back to back days. I iced it down after today's test and I'm optimistic it will be fine. I'm looking forward to being back on the trail for real - I even miss my tent a bit.Until then...","VA 607 Trailhead

I changed my plans to slack pack one of the sections I missed and decided to meet him on the trail at VA Highway 60.While waiting I got involved in an argument between  AT Conservancy Ridge Runner and a local shuttle driver. Words were exchanged and threats were made and before I knew it I was talking with a sheriff's deputy, recounting the exchange between the two.  When Foggy finally arrived I was told that I'd be contacted if I needed to be involved any further. Good luck on that because I'm hiking the trail and don't want to new bothered.

Many of the confessions were meant to be funny but several were sincere statements about shortcomings and omissions even before trail life began.After the shelter we learned the Penance we had to pay with about long, rocky descent of almost 3000 feet down the mountain. Long downhills about real painful to the knees about rend he rocks attack your feet and ankles.  By the time I reached the bottom I felt.like I had a atoned for all my sins on the trail.We crossed the Tye River at the bottom of the mountain and used the river as an opportunity to rest and recover.  Foggy took a quick swim but I just soakedyet feet because the water was doggone cold!  We fixed dinner at the river before hiking the final three miles to the shelter area and pitched tents and alost fell into our sleeping bags.

But our plan was weak ( or maybe our resolve was weak) and one beer turned into a few or several and we did dinner at the brewery as well and then slept at their free tenting field in the woods behind the brewery grounds.It was great fun and a much needed break from the trail.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568527,"Yesterday was a zero day as we waited out a full day's worth of rain.  When it pours all day and you're sitting in a hotel you feel really smart.  And then the next day you put on a heavy pack and go walking in the woods and any sense of smartness goes away!
Today's hike starts about a week in the Shenandoah National Park.  Rockfish Gap is where the Blue Ridge Parkway ends and Skyline Drive begins and I'm finally beginning to feel like Virginia will end soon.  The hike in Virginia is over 500 miles and it seems like we've been in Virginia since the very beginning of the walk.
You self register when you enter the park at a kiosk with a little metal box full of registration forms.  It's free to enter the park as a hiker but if you get caught without a registration form there is a fine of sorts so we dutifully filled out the triplicate form and stuffed the pink and yellow parts into the box - good little soldiers we are!
You can hear the road noise from Skyline Drive throughout the day and there are plenty of motorcycles moving both ways on the road.  The Park is a busy one so, at least for the first day it doesn't feel like you're too far into the wilderness.
Shenandoah is a little different from the trail we've experienced so far.  The mountains are lower with longer flat sections to walk.  This makes for easier hiking but the water sources are spread out farther.  There's still plenty of water in the creeks and springs, but there are fewer along the way.  The park also provides waysides, places for cars to pull off and get a bite to eat and we'll be walking close to several.  I'm sure we'll track them down and enjoy a few burgers and shakes along the way.","Rockfish Gap

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568530,"The second day in Shenandoah National Park is a lot like the first - relatively easy hiking with ups and downs that take us back to Skyline Drive.  The trail doesn't have a lot of landmarks and features and more than one hiker has commented that it feels like you're walking the same sections over and over again.
BUT - we hit our first wayside today and lunch was a burger, onion rings, a chocolate shake and a Dr. Pepper.  It's heaven when you get real food.  If not for the wayside lunch would have been some tuna salad from a foil pouch on a piece of smashed bread - my typical lunch on the trail.
We stayed too long at the wayside and our lunch was in late afternoon so we had the benefit of snacking a bit and not having to cook dinner.  Still went to bed feeling full but without the bother of cooking and cleaning up - another benefit of the waysides.
Chili Dog saw eight bears today, including a mother bear with three cubs.  I imagine seeing three cubs is pretty rare and he was lucky enough to get the troop on video.  He's becoming known as the Bear Whisperer because he seems to see bears a lot - and usually has video and photographic proof of his encounters.  My preference is to see no bears along the way so I'm happy to leave the bear encounters to Chili Dog.

At one cross Chili Dog made some trail magic happen.  He hiked with a day hiker for a bit and when the reached her car at one of the crossings she was kind enough to give him a ride to one of the nearby waysides so when Foggy and I got to the road he was on his way back delivering fried chicken and cold cokes.  A little bit of heaven and another day of avoiding foil pack tuna.
As promised we crossed the 900 mile mark and as with every significant milestone someone had created a marker milestone so we could pose for pictures.  I'm really looking forward to the 1000 mark and, of course, the halfway point - 1095.  today we got to the halfway point of the Park and the trail seems quieter with fewer hikers.  I""m wondering whether people are getting stuck at the waysides because of the food availability - I'm not sure why but it just seems like there are fewer hikers than normal.","Ivy Creek Overlook

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568534,"We cut back on the miles today to enjoy the Big Meadows Campground. Big Meadows is a large campground that attracts tenters but also a whole lot of RVs and other kinds of campers.  We got a spot near the Appalachian Trail, set up our little camp of four tents and found ourselves surrounded by motor homes, fifth wheels, RVs, pull behind campers and all sorts of outdoorsy vehicles.  We felt very small and out of place with our small collection of backpack size tents.
Our day started by passing through Lewis Mountain Campground - a much smaller campground - that afforded the opportunity for coffee and breakfast.  That stop, along with a late lunch at Big Meadows and dinner at the lodge gave a n entire day where we didn't have to pull the food back out of our packs. That is a rare but welcome event on the trail!  Again, we had Chili Dog to thank - he has a way, with his southern charm, of talking people into giving us a ride and we were driven a couple of miles to a wayside near Big Meadows for lunch.
The campground had hot showers and a laundry so it was a great chance to freshen up.  The showers were coin operated and for $1.75 you could get five minutes of hot water.  I learned that when soaking in a stream of fresh, hot water five minutes doesn't last so long - my shower ended up costing me $3.50.  It was worth every penny.
Near the end of the day  a couple with a fifth wheeler showed up and had to back the monster into a camping space.  It was great entertainment watching the wife directing the husband, yelling at the top of her lungs and doing nothing to really help out.  It was great entertainment for us but finally they got the  thing in reasonably well and left it alone for the night.  A little later some people pulled up into the area just next to ours and pitched a tenting that took the concept of car camping to an extreme.  About twenty feet from me they set up a tent big enough to park a car in (I mean REALLY!).  They set up cots, chairs and a table in the tent and a special little pad for their dog - who let us know all night long whether anyone was sneaking around the campground.
Before nightfall we were all basking in the peaceful, serene and tranquil outdoors.  I'm really looking forward to a small space in the woods tomorrow night - just big enough for my tent and quiet enough to hear the crickets.","Mile 913.8

But eventually off we went, until we came across a photo shoot going on for a rapper and another young singer.  The bright lights and commotion attracted us down a side trail and all of a sudden we were at a scenic overlook parking area watching a rapper we think is named Nice being videoed and photographed in front of a hot car with some of his friends.  His friends were very nice young ladies who apparently made so little money they couldn't adequately clothe themselves.
Our Southern Charmer went to work and before long we were taking pictures with the young ladies - a little awkward but still an interesting experience that I'm sure will spark some interesting conversation with Linda when I get home later this summer.  We didn't really pay any attention to the rapper, although I'm sure he's really good at what he does, whatever that might be.  
There was another young lady there - a singer we think is named Sahara.  She was very interested in why four guys would stumble out of the woods in the middle of nowhere and she chatted us up for awhile about the trail and all of our experiences along the way.  She was very nice and seemed really interested in what we were doing - I hope her singing career goes well.
Because of the delays and interruptions we didn't make it to the hut until about 8 p.m. so we had to cook dinner and set up tents in the twilight - but a great breakfast and a brush with semi-famous rappers and an entourage of scantily clad young ladies was certainly worth it!","Big Meadow Campground

Finally I told the others that if I had any hope of reaching our goal of Front Royal the next day I was going to have to leave and get another four or five miles down the trail.  My wonderful sister, Betsy, who once lived in Front Royal agreed to pick me up at the road crossing and spend a day in Front Royal with me.  There was a winery we used to visit when she lived there and I was looking forward to an off day and the chance to sit at the winery with a good bottle of wine, eating some cheese and sausage.
In any case I started up the mountain, and soon Foggy joined me.  We made it to the top of Little Hogback Mountain but didn't have a lot of luck finding a camping spot.  We finally found a spot that would suffice just past a Skyline Drive parking area and settled in for the night.  We never saw Chili Dog or Barrel (who started walking with us several days earlier) but we trusted that we would find them the next day.
This was the worst evening of the entire hike in terms of bugs - I hope this isn't a harbinger of buggy future!  While laying in my tent I took a swipe at one bug that had made it into my tent.  Unfortunately I was adding some thoughts to my notebook at the time and promptly poked a pretty good size hole in my tent with the pen I was holding.

While in Harper's Ferry we checked in at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters, had our picture taken and entered into the official log of through hikers.  I am hiker number 870 who has reached Harper's Ferry and in reviewing the log I saw a number of familiar faces of people who have reached the halfway point before me.

I did a snake jump today - walking along not paying much attention until I looked down to see half a snake right at my feet.  thankfully, it was the safe end and I immediately jumped straight into the air.  It's something that happens without thinking and is probably some sort of survival instinct thing.  The snake was a black snake with no rattler so I was safe all along but it's still pretty alarming when you notice a snake four inches from your right foot.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570647,"Had a wonky day walking out of Waynesboro. I'm not sure if it's from three months of hiking or just being tired all the time but I had a hard time concentrating today. Almost right off the bat I was walking the wrong way at road crossings and getting confused at trail heads. At one point I was sure I was going the right way only to finally realize that I was referring to a section of the guidebook about five miles back.
I'm still hiking with the same small group and even though we all walk the same distance every day we walk at different speeds. I'm the slowest so I'm walking alone most of the time. I'll have to focus more to avoid wandering around lost.
The trail really isn't hard to follow if you pay attention to the blazes and signs - but some times the mind wanders.
There was a 20% chance of rain today but we got a 100% thunder shower late in the afternoon. Being wet is never good but we had our spirits lifted by trail magic at the State Park.
For the last 14 years a man from Indianapolis has come to the trail for a week with some of his family and hosts hikers. You get a free place to pitch a tent, breakfast and dinner. It was a great break after hiking through the rain. Good home-cooked food always lifts the spirits.
It's people like Cook Doctor (his trail name) that makes the trail possible.  Before the evening was over more than 30 hikers showed up. It was quite the gathering.
Today was also the summer solstice and there is a hiker tradition to hike naked on the longest day of the year - don't ask me why!!
Be assured that under my hiking clothes I was completely naked. I'm not one to mess with tradition.  By the way I didn't see any naked hikers today (thank goodness).","PA 16 - Waynesboro

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570648,"After our trail magic breakfast from the Cook Doctor we made quick work of a good day. Covered 15 miles in 7 and a half hours including breaks. The terrain is somewhat flat and we haven't seen a lot of the notorious Pennsylvania rocks yet so it was an easy day.
We crossed the official halfway point today which was a real morale booster. A few miles later we passed the marked halfway point (the trail changes length every year so there really isn't a fixed halfway point although there is a marker that says you've made it halfway. )
We did get one surprise a few hundred yards short of the official halfway mark. I was walking in front of Foggy when my brain warnings went off and I stopped dead in my tracks. About 10 feet in front was the first rattle snake we had seen. It was about three feet long with about five or six sections in its rattle. We waited patiently until it moved on.
Here's my halfway inventory:
On my third pair of shoes, repaired two holes in my tent, on my third set of rubber tips for my trekking poles, on my third set of socks (pairs number 5 and 6), my pack shows some wear and tear I'm a little worried about and it reeks from all the sweat it has accumulated.
Packs and sleeping bags seem to be the biggest worry points for most hikers because they are really hard to clean. Down sleeping bags can't be thrown in the washer and there is no good way to clean a backpack thoroughly so we just live with the funky smell.
Reaching the halfway point makes the hike seem short going forward. We don't talk anymore about how far we have come, instead we talk about how far we have left and that number gets smaller every day. I'm really feeling like I can do this thing!","Caledonia State Park

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570650,"Woke to rain today so we waited it out and got a late start. The goal today is to make it to Pine Grove Furnace State Park and consider the half gallon challenge.
The challenge is another AT tradition. To celebrate reaching the halfway mark hikers take on the challenge of eating a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting.
We made it to the Park a little before 10 and opted out of the challenge. I had a ham and egg sandwich on an English muffin and some chocolate milk instead. I didn't think I could finish the ice cream.and I didn't want to hike with a belly full.
We hung around until after lunch and finally a couple hikers took on the challenge. The younger of the two polished off the ice cream in less than half an hour. The older hiker (somewhere in his 60s I'd guess) was still struggling to finish when we finally decided to leave.
The Park is also the site of the AT museum. On the way out we spent half an hour wandering the small museum. If you're ever in the area it's worth stopping to see the stories of the first through hikers and the people who built the trail

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570651,"We walked into Boiling Springs on flat ground, making a fast day of 12 miles. The terrain in this part of Pennsylvania is very flat and we spent a big part of the day walking through meadows and fields.
Walking into town we passed our third halfway point marker. The third one is Center Point Knob, a small hill with a monument at the top commemorating the halfway point when the trail was otiginally created.
Boiling Springs is  a pretty little town right on the trail so it's a great spot for a quick stop to refresh and refuel. We stayed at a small five bed hostel run by Lisa. The hostel is a converted shed behind her house but offers a hot shower, cold drinks and a quiet place to sleep. We enjoyed our night there.
The town doesn't offer a lot of places to eat so we ended up at the Tavern, a higher end eatery. The food was fantastic but very pricey relative to trail standards. I couldn't help myself and started dinner with six oysters on the half shell. It was a little bit of heaven to be eating like this.
Boiling Springs is worth a visit if you're ever in the area. It gets its name from the artesian springs that form a small lake on the center of town. The lake empties into a creek that attracts fly fisherman and the place just seems to bustle with activity. Wish I could have stayed longer.
It also has a history with the Underground Railroad. I'd like to learn more about that at some point.","James Frye Shelter

The trail goes right through the small town of Duncannon and right by the Doyle Hotel.The Doyle is an ancient hotel that attracts many hikers because it has good food, cold beer and cheap lodging rates. It also has every known code violation - exposed wiring, leaky pipes, loose stair bannisters, entire sections closed off due to disrepair. But other than that it's a great place.It's run by Pat and Vickie, two hippie era oldsters who work hard and keep most of the hikers happy. They keep the food good and the beer cheap and their business fuels a lot of other businesses in town.

It's scarce not because of a lack of rain. The scarcity comes from walking on flat rocky ridges all day - there are no streams, creeks or springs.  We had to carry extra water over 11 miles today so we would have enough to cook with. That's about six extra pounds in your pack for 11 long miles. Our little group decided to push the miles up so we could trim a day and get to Hamburg in 4 days instead of 5. Maybe not the smartest thing given the rocks but you don't have to be smart to walk the trail. We walked as far as we could and picked a small camping area on top of a mountain. We camped along side Amanda and Kai a mother and son out for their first camping trip. They had a purple and pink tent with caricatures of cats on the side.

They were slack packing the day and offered to give us a ride to Wendy's and back. It was an offer we couldn't refuse.I made the day longer by walking in circles for awhile. There was a project replacing a small bridge on the trail. The new bridge was in place so I crossed it and a little while later saw very official looking signs saying AT this way. So I followed the signs and ended up walking back to the section before the new bridge. The section was a bypass trail for the time when the bridge wasn't installed yet and no one had bothered to take down the bypass signs. But I'm a fast learner so the second time I walked across the bridge I didn't follow the official looking signs - live and learn (said with a long sigh).The rocks are steady - long sections broken up with the relief of flat soft sections of the trail.

Please bear with me. I'll update as quickly as I can.

Finished a four day push to Port Clinton today. The mileage said it should have been five days but we pushed forward the last three days.  Got rained on the last two days and I was anxious to find a hotel with a laundry.
Made my walk about two miles longer today when I got off course and wandered a bit. I got to a confusing section and walked the wrong way. Opened Google Maps and it told me I was on the trail, so I kept walking until it told me to make a turn that wasn't there. Finally backtracked and found the right trail. As we all know you can't always trust Google Maps.

We overnighted in Hamburg PA to resupply food,  take a shower and do the laundry after two days of rainy hiking. Our plan was to hit the trail a little after 12 and get  a good five or six hours of hiking.  But...
 
Hamburg is home to the largest Cabela's in the world and who could pass up a visit there?  A quick tour and lunch at their restaurant took us to 2 p.m. Then we got stuck at Walmart...again. It happens every time we go to Walmart. There's  everything we need there but it's always hard to get away because of the constant debate between what I need and what I'm willing to carry.
 
Then we had to listen to Steve the Angry Shuttle Driver tell us how hates every single person in Hamburg and that he has challenged half of them to a fist fight. Steve is 72 years old but it doesn't seem to slow him down.
 
Finally we get back to the trail in Port Clinton at about 3:30 and we notice that rain is rolling in. Then we find out about the Port Clinton Volunteer Fire Department and social club that serves really cheap beer to members and guests. Somehow we get in as guests of people we never met and drink beer while waiting for the rain to pass over. The fact that it never did rain is not germane because it's always better safe than sorry.
 
About 8:30 we trekked backwards on the trail to a free tenting spot and called it a night. So our good intentions turned into a negative mileage day - but it was fun and we got to meet some really nice locals.

My only experience with New Jersey before this trip is the part around New York City, very industril, big cities and not what I would call pretty.  This section cures me of that idea about New Jersey and I know now why they call it the Garden State.  There are many ponds and lakes along the way and it's not uncommon to walk up on a pond covered with water lillies in bloom.  New Jersey is a relatively short section of the trail but it's one that I'll remember for a while.","Catfish Fire Tower

Unfortunately, only Chilli Dog and I made it.  Foggy and Barrel got hung up along the way at the High Point Lake Beach area and decided not to push into town.  I skipped the beach area and its concession stand - the problem with concession stands is that they are an easy place to get stuck for an extra hour or two.  I thought it best, for my 21 mile quest, to skip it.

Slept in the town park behind the town playground.  The town provided a free tenting area with a port-a-potty and a spigot for water.  Within a block or so is a small store that has a deli and across the street is a pizza place - everything you need for a brief stop.

Later in the day I walked a long - about a mile - section of boardwalk through a swampy area with observation posts set up.  the birds were very active but I didn't see any other wildlife in the swamp.  The boardwalk made for fast hiking and I was right on schedule to hit the hot dog stand before it closed at 6 p.m.
I got to the stand about 5:15 to see a bright white sign posting the stand's new hours - 11 to 4.  I was out of luck; and there was no apparent water source.  I was faced with walking up and over the Staircase to Heaven for another three miles to get to water, which would have meant I would be setting up the tent and cooking probably around 8 p.m.  With no water to cook dinner and no food from the hot dog stand and no will to climb to heaven I did an immediate cave and set to heck with this and started walking the 1.3 miles to a motel.  I was fortunate that someone picked me up almost immediately and within 15 minutes I was sitting in my hotel room pondering a hot shower.
Chilli showed up later and texted and he was able to get to the motel to share the room with me.  He brought along Crocs (a guy with that trail name, not the brand of shoe) who was in our same situation so the three of us shared the room.  Foggy and Barrel were nowhere to be found.  Turns out they stopped short again and would try to catch us the next day.

The early part of the trail was pretty nice and we lunched at the Wawayander State Park office before making the final push out of new Jersey and into New York.  We met a couple of dayhikers on the trail who shared with us that the weather reports now said thundershowers at about 3 p.m.  they were the most accurate weather persons I've seen because almost at the stroke of 3 we heard the big booms and then got poured on for the next hour and a half.

The good news for the day was that we found two instances of trail magic along the way - coolers full of iced down soda, which is always a welcome site.

The bad news is that it rained hard and we ended up walking a long section of what we come to call the Appalachian River.  Water cascades down the trail and the only choice is to walk right through it and hope for high ground.

We climbed to the ridges that would take us into New York, found the border and the American flag that sits on top of the highest point on the Appalachian Trail in the state of New York and then walked about six miles across boulder fields at the top of the New York ridges.  The boulders were wet from the rain and we moved along at about 1 mile per hour.  I fell three times, each time landing on my butt when my feet went out from under me on the slick rocks.  The three of us walking together scored seven falls between us.  The worst casualties were skinned up elbows and Crocs had a pretty good  black and purple bruise on is butt.

About three hours late we made it to Greenwood Lake, NY for another stay in a hotel.  We plan to take a zero day to let the others catch up - maybe two zero days because the bodies are very sore and tired right now.  

We heard from the others late at night that they were still struggling to get to Greenwood Lake and weren't sure they would get in tomorrow.  They sent a video of a raging creek, one Chilli and I crossed earlier today without a problem, and the small footbridge had washed away.  Not sure how they got across - that will be a good story to hear when they catch up.

We'll see tomorrow if our small group can get back together.  I think we're all beginning to think that we have to slow the pace a bit, especially the closer we get to New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine - the hardest part of the trail, according to many.","Vernon, NJ

We had hiked on and off with Moonbeam for the last couple of weeks and yesterday she had to leave the trail. She was on leave from work and her time was running out so she decided it was time to go. We all had a great time watching her reunite with her dog who she had not seen for four months. We're sorry to see Moonbeam go.

As you walk through the path gets tighter and tighter until you and your pack get squeezed pretty good. The guidebook recommends removing packs but I took the challenge of getting through with my pack still on. It was a struggle but I made it.
After the squeezer there was an almost vertical climb up some smaller boulders but the trail provided some relief with a small sign that said Easy Way. We all took the easy way - we're tired, what did you expect?Our destination - West Mountain Shelter - was a tough 0.6 mes off the trail bit Foggy and I decided to go anyway because at night there is a view of the Manhattan sky line off to the East. We arrived just before a brief thunderstorm but after it cleared and after night fell we were not disappointed with a view of lights stretching across the horizon. I'll upload a picture, although it doesn't do justice to the scene. Earlier in the day we went a little out of our way to have lunch at a state park beach because we could get pop and ice cream out of a vending machine. Chilli and Barrel stayed a little longer than me and Foggy and we didn't see them for the rest of the day.We got  to cross the Palisades Parkway at rush hour which turned into a game of Frogger. It was a little scary because after walking for four and a half months all traffic seems to move at about 90 miles an hour (some cars probably were).I had a little bit of a serendipitous piece of luck today as I sat eating lunch at a waterfall. My mother was born in Monroe NY, a place I've never visited. I wondered whether the trail goes near Monroe, and today I found out.  I checked my phone during lunch and my weather widget said I was in Monroe.

I had two Nathan's All Beef hotdogs, chips and a Pepsi. Much better than the tuna fish or peanut butter sandwich I would have had.The Park is also the site of the AT zoo. The zoo is a rehab facility for local animals but includes some that are too damaged to be returned to the wild.  We saw a three legged fox, a good example of a permanent zoo resident. After leaving the park we immediately crossed the Hudson River and keptoving north.We stayed that night at Graymoor Spiritual Center, a retirement facility for Franciscan friars and sisters.  The grounds included two cemeteries - one for the friars and one for the nuns and many memorials. It also includes a large recreational area that the Center allows hikers to use for tenting.The guidebook said showers are available and indeed there was a shower. Cold water only which made for an invigorating chance  to clean up a bit.Later that night Barrel and Foggy caught up to us so our gang of four was together again.The day was marked by the steady sounds of explosions in the morning and a lot of gunfire in the afternoon. Turns out we were hiking near West Point and there must have been some training going on.  We also saw a stream of official looking helicopters all day - not the green military ones but blue and white ones that flew very fast.

We met a team of four young people tenting at the park, using it as a base camp for their work. The four worked for the state of New York  and we're in the middle of doing a census of invasive species in several NY state parks. We enjoyed the evening with a few beers and heard their stories about the work they were doing to identify and sometimes remove the invasive species.

On top of the Deli we had trail magic early. I sat at the base of.the largest tree on the trail, another AT landmark, and had a banana, crunchy Cheetohs, Gatorade and a Coke before moving on. It's simply not possible to eat too much on the trail.
Right before the Deli I crossed the great OkeeNewYorkee swamp on a long boardwalk (I made the name up if you hadn't figured that out). Along the Boardwalk were two Adirondack chairs. The one to the north was labeled Maine, the one to the south, Georgia. It seems there are reminders all along the way.
Right after the swamp I crossed the Appalachian Trail railroad station. If only I knew I could have taken the train!!!

After the Deli I started up the mountain bMIy myself, passed what I called the Weasley house and later an ent (hobbit reference ) that looked like it came out of a Tim Burton movie.

Kent has a laundry, showers and a grocery store - everything we need to keep us on the trail. Our original plan was to make a big push from Greenwood Lake to Great Barrington - ten or 11 straight days on the trail, but we still need to clean up every few days.

Foggy's sister was kind enough to meet us at the trailhead and shuttle us into Kent. We arrived a little late and the rec center providing shower facilities closed. But we made it to the grocery store and laundry before they closed. But other than the cold shower at the Franciscan center I haven't bathed in six days!
Passed the 2/3 mark today and put New York behind us. Nine states done.
We got a bit of a scare today when I found out why the other guys got in so late last night. Foggy's knee was becoming quite a problem and he woke up this morning thinking he would have to leave the trail. He struggled to the shelter last night, going slow all the way. He took it slow and decided to keep pushing through. We'll see how it goes.Almost forgot! With Foggy's help I saw my second bear today, about 50 yards in front of us, crossing the trail.

We saved some time choosing to take a high water side trail, rather than risk the creek crossing at the trail head.  It had rained a couple of days prior and there were posted warnings about potential high water in the creek.  After taking the side trail and avoiding the creek we got conflicting reports about the water.  One section hiker said she was in water up to her knees, another through hiker said she had no trouble getting across.  Better safe than sorry.
The hike today was pretty uneventful.  The only interesting part was hearing the noises of a loud car, obviously taking advantage of some open road.  The noise was consistent and louder as we walked on.  turns out we walked by a road course raceway nestled in the Connecticut hills and there was a single car practicing.  We had a reasonable view of part of the course and stood and watched for awhile.  The car was a LeMans style race car and was loud even from a distance.

Katahdin in Maine some six or seven weeks ago.  It's interesting meeting the SOBOs (as their called; we're NOBOs) to hear their impressions of the trail behind them - our future. I find it curious that I'm also meeting up with NOBOs that I met very early in the hike, including one I met my first day on the trail.  You go for weeks and even months without seeing people and then they pop up.  I'm always sure that they are long gone but for some reason or another they end up at about my same space.
The walk out of town was beautiful.  For about the fourth or fifth day we walked along the Housatonic River and not far our of town we cam by the Falls.  By late morning we were in Salisbury, CT a very pretty, quaint town that brings to my mind the stereotypical New England town.  We lunched at the grocery store deli and enjoyed a short break to do some people watching and relaxing.
After that the real work began.  We climbed to the top of Bear Mountain, Connecticut's highest peak.  The climb up was steep and rocky and the climb down was worse.  We had intended to make it to Massachusetts today but we found a great tenting site near an active little creek - a peaceful babbling brook - and decided to call it a day.
The big milestone today was crossing the 1500 mile mark.

Ten states behind us, four to go.  Mass. is Foggy's home state and he was glad to be home, and looking forward to more visits from family and friends.We climbed Mount Everett today, a rocky and steep climb and a tiring and challenging welcome to Massachusetts. Mount Everett took us up over 2000 feet for the first time in a long time, topping out around 2600 feet.  We're walking toward some 3, 4, and 5 thousands foot peaks so getting the legs accustomed to climbing again is probably not a bad thing.  Coming down Mount Everett was steep and rocky, not a lit of fun at all.  My first impression of the Massachusetts trail is not a good one.Our little group had agreed in the morning to hike past US 7, the getting off point for Great Barrington and do some stealth camping in the wood north of the crossing.  Barrel had arranged for a zero day at a lake cabin owned by friends and it was still another eight miles up the trail. But as chance would have it just as we crossed US 7, Joe the shuttle driver pulled up and asked if we were the guys who called for a ride.  It's bad form to take someone else's ride so we admitted that we indeed were not those guys but that we'd still love a ride into Great Barrington.  The lure of dinner at McDonald's and a cold coke or beer was too much.  Joe agreed to come back for us as soon as he could and we waited maybe 30 minutes for our ride to the Great Barrington Community Center for a night of free tenting.  Use of the showers, sauna and pool was available for $7.00 but we decided to pass on that because we'd be at the cabin tomorrow.The tenting was in the woods, up a hill behind the Community Center and the mosquitoes were fierce.  I pitched my tent as fast as I could, got my stuff together and got out of the woods before I drained off too much of my blood supply!","Sages Ravine Campsite

We opted for the long day.
It was long in miles but the trail was relatively easy today so we made the 18 or so miles in reasonable time, feeling good at the end. Days like this are heartening because you make some good miles without being total wasted by the time you're done. There were no big climbs or descents today and that helps a lot with making the miles.
I extend the walk another mile by taking the half mile side trail to Goose Pond Shelter.  It's a shelter that gets talked a lot about by other hikers so my curiosity got the best of me.  The shelter is a small house tucked into the woods near Goose Pond and is managed by live-in caretakers.  They provide breakfast in the morning, which is a real treat on the trail.  I got there and enjoyed lunch on the porch, feeding myself out of my food bag.  There was no view of the pond from the shelter and I didn't bother to walk down to the pond.  I'd seen it on my walk into the shelter area so that was good enough for me.","Shaker Camp Site

Today was also the second day in a row that we raced against thunder and rain late in the day.  Both today and yesterday we made it to the shelter in time to set up before the rain started.  Great timing on our part!  I think I'm getting better at anticipating the rain and creating a strategy to avoid walking in the downpours - it's been a while since I've been soaking wet from the rain.
Was luck wasn't completely good because as I sat in the shelter fixing and eating dinner the skies opened up.  I tried to wait it out but it poured for a couple of hours and I had to make the dash back to my tent in the downpour.  But it was certainly better than walking through the rain for a couple of hours.
It seems like there was a steady light rain all night but it's more likely that I was hearing the ""second rain"" on my tent all night.  Whenever it rains out in the woods you get three rains instead of just one.  The first is the actual rain.  The second is the rain that drips off the leaves of the canopy after it has stopped raining.  The third are the very brief downpours you get when a gust of wind rustles the tress and all those drops come down on your head all at once.  Sometimes you even get the second and third rains the morning after a night time rain storms.  It's hard to avoid getting wet in the woods!
One highlight today was a quick detour to the Stop and Shop in North Adams for a donut and some chocolate lunch; what hikers call second breakfast (followed by lunch and sometimes second lunch).  The extra calories were worth it because we had three moderate climbs today - all at a gentle slope but still long climbs.  It never hurts to have a little sugar surging through the veins during those climbs.","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

The slopes are not too steep and the grass is pretty short so it's a good walk up. The top of Bromley is the drop off point for a ski lift and provides access to three or four slopes back down the mountain. In the summer it has the feel of a ghost town, but I'm sure it is a busy place in the winter.
We slept in a ski patrol warming hut that was enclosed and had real glass windows. The windows keep out the bugs so it's worth staying in the shelter. But it turns out that we would have been better off in tents because we had a world class snorer (way worse than even me) in the hut and it turned into a long night.
The sunset was amazing and it was a peaceful place to spend the evening. Another day worth all the work and all the hiking.","Stratton Pond Tent Site

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574916,"We decided to make a longer day today because most of the trail was downhill. Turns out we pushed our luck a little too far.
Two days early in the week we raced to tent sites trying to beat the rain and both times were able to set up, get dinner and settle.in before the rain started. But today the sky opened up and rained hard for the last two hours of the hike. The forecast said no rain and the surprise shower caught us and a whole lot of day hikers racing down the trail as I was going up.
Rather than try to fight the rain I stayed in the shelter - the first open sided shelter for me in the last couple months. I cant exactly remember the last time I stayed in an open shelter. The rain kept the bugs down and it was a tolerable night. 
The tent site was along a beautiful large pond and it was a great place to tent, except for the rain. When we left Bromley the skies were blue and it looked like another beautiful day on the trail - but the trail is always full of surprises","Bromley Summit Warming Hut

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574920,"I'm carrying a wet and heavy pack today after yesterday's soaking but most of the hike was easy to moderate. We had a big climb up Bear Mountain with long rocky and steep stretches near the top. 
But all in all it was a good day - made even better by Foggy's wife meeting us at a trail crossing to take us into town for a good dinner.
We ate at Appleby's and had ice cream at a Ben and Jerry's and returned to the trail for one more mile to the shelter. The last mile turned out to be the worst with a very steep climb including some vertical rock climbing.  
During the day we stopped for a break at a shelter and met a Yong lady who had her pack stolen near the top of Killington Mountain. We heard about it the day before and today we got to meet her in person.
The trail goes near the peak of Killington Mountain and commonly when a side trail leads to a peak hikers drop their packs and climb up the side trail. I've done it many times along the trail. The young lady dropped her pack and when she got back it was gone. Some locals figured out where the thief accessed the mountain and called the police. By the time the thief made it off the mountain the police were waiting for him. It would be tragic to lose your pack but the common joke is that after 1700 miles there's nothing of value left in the pack so who knows why the guy stole the pack. Thank goodness for the hiker that the thief wasn't too smart. I guess he didn't know that you can't make a quick escape from the top of a mountain. Thank goodness for stupid criminals.","Little Rock Pond Shelter

We climbed Killington - a climb of about 2600 feet over ten miles. When we got to the top we took the steep and rocky side trail to the peak with our packs on - still a little nervous about the pack thief story we heard the previous day. On the way up I met a man in saffron monk robes climbing back down in his bare feet. When I asked how he was doing he gave me a big smile and said he was wonderful. I was certainly full of wonder watching him negotiate the rocks with his bare feet.
The summit afforded the best views we've seen in all of Vermont and we noticed that the wind and cold was a little sharper than what we've been experiencing the last month or so.
Lunch was at the snack bar near the top of the mountain. There is a gondola that takes people to the summit so the snack bar was a busy place. We had a good lunch and waited out a short rain at the snack bar before taking a much easier and safer trail back down to where we left the AT.
Carolea met us at the trailhead and took us into Rutland for a resupply and a welcome zero day. I stayed in town at the Travel Inn and Foggy went with his wife to join a family event for the weekend.  Foggy's daughter surprised him showing up for dinner.

Foggy's daughter Emma was our trail angel today, providing a ride to breakfast and then to the trailhead. It was fun to see her energy and excitement about her father's adventure.
There were no significant landmarks on the trail today and no convenient shelter so we stealth camped just past a small stream. We did come to a drop off on the trail that included an aluminum ladder to.climb down. Not sure how I would have made the climb down without it so I was certainly happy to see it.

The pie stop is a great example of how information gets passed up and down the trail quickly and efficiently. 
For several days we've been hearing about the homemade pies at a place called Edge of the Farm and when we got to the road crossing we made quick work of the 0.2 miles off trail to enjoy some lunch and to share a small mixed berry pie. It was delicious and well worth the stop.

Foggy arranged for us to stay with friends of his sister in law and when we walked into Norwich, VT Sarah met us. We asked Sarah if it would be OK to walk another mile or so into Hanover so we could put the border crossing behind us. Also I wanted to celebrate my birthday today with a nice glass of Jim Beam. She was kind enough to keep herself busy while we walked into Hanover and had dinner at the downtown.
Hanover is home to Dartmouth University and is a very much a small college town.
Earlier in the day, sometime late morning, we crossed the Connecticut River for the first time and after crossing heard someone calling to us from a house just off the trail. This was the famous Blue Barn where Linda and Randy cook breakfast for any hikers going by. We stopped for second breakfast of scrambled eggs and sausage and enjoyed the company of a cope more hikers. This is another great example of the kindness and generosity of people all along the trail.
After my celebratory dinner and bourbon Sarah drove us out to her home where we met Mike and Jesse. Just as we arrived Sarah pointed out Mike working one of his border collies in the field across the road. Mike participates in trials showing off his well trained border collies and we watched him practice with his dog Kip. Kip was very efficient in herding a small flock of sheep through a course and I was amazed that I was standing there enjoying this experience. Only on the trail do you experience these serendipitous encounters, it seems.
We enjoyed the evening with Sarah and her family, sleeping in a real bed after a hot shower.  And now I'm a little smarter about what it takes to train a dog to herd sheep. And I'm grateful for that.
I had one more interesting birthday experience. Mike and Sarah's daughter Jesse has two cows that she keeps pretty much as pets. After watching the dog do its work we walked back to the house and the two cows approached, walking right up to me expecting a good head scratch. I obliged, amazed at how comfortable these cows are around people.","Thistle Hill Shelter

Easy walk with some small ups and downs. The highlight was trail magic of pizza and soda for lunch at one of the road crossings. Also I came across an area deep in the woods where there were many plastic tubes running from tree to tree. I was told later these are set ups for collecting the maple sap during sap season
 I've never seen these before so it was fun seeing how they make the collection process more efficient.
Still running into  a lot of South bound hikers. They are always full of hiking advice and after a while you wonder whether they have some awareness that we north bounders already have almost 1800 miles behind us.

Usually when you're hiking the trail it's impossible to get a good picture of where you're headed. Smarts Mountain runs in such a way that you can see the mountain ridges you'll be crossing for the next several days. This perspective gave me a much better idea of the distances I cover from day to day.

They hiked to Harper's Ferry and then flipped up to Maine to resume their hike south bound. U-Turn gave me a big hug and I had a good talk.with her father and it felt like a real reunion. 
It started raining steady before we even left the shelter and it rained pretty hard almost all day long.  These days don't get toe like they used to - I guess I'm just getting used to being wet every now and then
For days we had been hearing about the omelette guy and today I met him. About three yards after the Welcome to the Whites sign he was set up right along the trail with tarps, chairs and other comforts, cooking omelets for anyone who wanted one. He asked you how many eggs you wanted a then cooked up an omelette with ham, onions and green peppers. Juice and coffee were also on the menu. I settled for a four egg omelette although most hikers were asking for ten or twelve eggs. The record was 30 eggs, if you can believe that.  
First thing that morning I had to climb and cross the summit of Cube Mountain. The rain was falling hard and the wind gusts were strong enough to stagger me a couple of times.  So taking a break for a hot omelette was much appreciated. 
Foggy and I decided to abandon our original destination and head to a hostel just off the trail so we could clean up and dry off a bit before taking on Moosilauke Mountain.

It's the gateway mountain to the White Mountains and the first of several big climbs. It's been months since we've been this high and I have to say I was a little intimidated at the thought of a 3000 foot climb.
But all went well and we negotoasted a steep climbup and an even steeper climb down. The down part was the most challenging as we had to negotiate the last mile and a half through wet rocks along side a fast moving waterfall of a creek.
The last mile or so to the top was an easy climb after a couple of miles of steep rocky climb and when we got to the top I was disappointed that the weather didn't allow much of a view. The top is above tree line and we had to navigate from one rock cairn to another and the fog made it hard to see the cairns at all. But I made it, snapped some pictures and began the long climb down. I did about a mile per hour down the steep decline which is about half as fast as usual.
When we got down to the notch Carolee, Foggy's wife, was waiting for us and we had a ride reunion with Barrel. He left us a couple weeks ago and we haven't seen him since, so it was fun to catch up with his progress.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576333,"August 20 was a well deserved day of rest as I shared a two bedroom suite (with kitchen and living room) with Foggy and Carolee.  We had a short, unexpected reunion with Barrel and Chilli Dog and they spent the night on the floor of the living room.  There are two trailheads near Lincoln, NH and they were coming off the second one as we came off the first, so they are still a day or two ahead of us.  It was fun catching up with them and hearing their stories from the last couple of weeks.
We got a late start today with a big breakfast and after after dropping off the other two  we were back on trail by 10:30, climbing Mount Kinsman, the second of the big White Mountain climbs.  Our breakfast was at the Indiana Head resort, a tourist resort overlooking a mountain with what appears to be an Indian looking out over the valley.  We're in the area of the former Old Man of the Mountain (which fell down several years ago, of course.) 
The climb to Kinsman Peak was steep and rocky with lots of hand over hand rock scrambling.  Because of the late start we knew it would be better to shoot for a low mileage day and that's what we did. 
We were first to the Eliza Brooks Shelter and set up tents anyway.  Before the evening was over the site filled up and a Dartmouth freshman orientation hiking group took over the shelter.  I was glad to be away from there as it was pretty lively and noisy for awhile.  Among the through hikers we drew straws to see who would be the one to tell them to keep it down, but they quieted down on their own at about 8:00 p.m. so all was well.
The Presidential Range is next and that's a little foreboding with tales of long rock climbs, high altitude and lousy weather.  The hike at this point is largely mental (60 percent mental and the other half is physical for all you Yogi fans) so the thought of the big climbs ahead is a little intimidating.","Kinsman Notch

They are still useful to through hikers because they keep a pot of soup on most of the day and if you hit the hut at the right time you can get a hot bowl of soup and some home made bread for a couple of dollars. And that's what we did.  There is a work for stay option that allows a very small number of through hikers to sleep on the floor with full meals in exchange for some labor, like washing dishes.  We got to this first hut around lunch time so we had no interest in staying the night.  After our soup we hiked on.Ran into another group of young people participating in a freshman orientation experience - this time from Yale.  We talked a bit with them and this is one of several experiences incoming freshman can choose for their orientation.  They are assigned to a group of 10 or so hikers, with a student leader and use the hike to make new friends and learn a little about what to expect gong forward.  they said their hike is scheduled for six days and five nights.We stayed the night at Liberty Springs Campsite, our first New Hampshire paid camp site.  All the way back to Georgia the campsites and shelters are free but the Appalachian Mountain Club requires a payment to use the sites, something that's not particularly pleasing to the through hikers.  The AMC is clearly in the business of funding development of resources for hikers of all types, not just through hikers, and the emphasis seems to be on paying customers. The first site is $10 and then you get a card that lets you stay at other sites for $5. The card also gets you a free bowl of soup at one of the huts, so there are some benefits for the through hiker.","Eliza Brook Shelter

Right after the guests finished dinner about twenty or so of them gathered to listed to Foggy and me relate our experience with the trial.  They asked lots of good questions and it was a fun and interesting experience for us as well as the guests.The White Mountains are a little frustrating because the terrain makes it impossible for us to get any big days in and the spacing of huts and shelters is a bit of problem.

Someone counted nine of them and since they weren't venomous everyone left them alone and they left us alone.  Not sure what was going with the snakes but it seemed odd that they would hang out in such a crowded place.Last night's work stay proved to be enough for us.  Free food (free calories) was OK but by the time we got to eat - both dinner and breakfast - the food was cold, congealed a bit and not all that tasty.  Hikers never complain about free food but it was enough to teach us that we can feel good about leaving the work for stay option for hikers with fewer resources than us. The rest of the day was spent getting closer to Mount Washington, the highest point in the Whites, second highest on the Appalachian Trail at 6288 feet and a real test of endurance and tolerance.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576343,"Today is the the day I've been waiting for - the climb over Mount Washington.  It started as a fun and magnificent day and ended as a very frustrating day. 
We set off a little earlier than usual hoping for a fair weather day. Over the last week or so we've heard stories from the south bounders about crossing in foggy mists and enduring gale force winds - something that's pretty common on Washington, even in the middle of summer.  The forecast for us was clear skies and winds in the 25 to 30 mile per hour range.
As we approached Mount Eisenhower Foggy's children (adult children) met us on the trail and continued the hike up to Washington.  Their energy helped power us up the mountain and we made it right on schedule.  Thanks to both Emma and Tyler for helping us summit the big one!
It's very difficult to manage your schedule on the trail - you take things one day at a time and try to keep moving forward.  As it turned out we hit the top of Washington a little after noon on a Saturday. suffice to say it was crowded.  We waited in a line of about 30-40 people for our pictures at the summit sign and laughed about how we walked all the way up for our picture while most people rode the cog railway to the top or drove up in their cars.  To each his own - I guess if you get there then you deserve a picture at the summit sign, regardless.
We had lunch and visited awhile and then Foggy had to say goodbye to Emma and Tyler. The hike down was just as steep and rocky as they way up and it turned into a grueling day for.  Our goal was to get down to Madison Spring Hut with the hope that we could sleep on the floor that night.  Tenting sites are a little sparse and we weren't sure what other options we had.
When we finally arrived at the Hut, much later than we hoped due to the tough terrain, the work for stay options were taken.  We asked about sleeping on the floor and the hut manager was quick to say no. She said we would have to go down to the tent site.  The tent site was 0.6 miles down a steep rock scramble to a site with pretty poor conditions for setting up a tent and earlier in the day other hikers had warned us off of making the climb down. The site was off trail so it meant we would have to make the climb back up the next morning just to get back to the hut - an investment of 1.2 miles of steep and tough rock climbs.
We tried a second time with the hut manager but apparently she was a finalist for employee of the month and took a hard line with us - the rules are what they are and it would be best for us to move on.  
By then it was almost dark so we resigned ourselves to the 1.2 mile misery of a long steep round trip climb.  On the way down we met two other hikers climbing back up saying they too had been sent away but found nothing at the tent site.  We continued down but eventually we were passed by three young people in military camouflage uniforms who said they had climbed back up to catch the sunset and affirmed that there wasn't much room at the bottom. We had seen a bunch of uniformed soldiers at the top of Washington and the best guess was that the reservists were out for a weekend of training and they were scattered across several tent sites in the area.  Foggy and I looked at each for a while and decided to go back up for a final try.  We weren't sure what we'd do if we got turned down again, but the third time was a charm and the hut manager finally agreed to let us sleep on the hut floor.  We were grateful for that but frustrated with a very tiring end to a magnificent day crossing one of the highlights of the Trail. 
We still have several climbs ahead but the last big climb, until Mount Katahdin at the end, is behind us. Hooray for that!","Mizpah Hut Tentsite
",Madison Spring Hut,"Aug 26, Sat",11.80
Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576344,"Immediately after Madison Springs Hut is the climb up to Mount Madison.  Madison is literally a big pile of rocks and boulders - no trees, shrubs or other vegetation - and the task for the morning was scrambling up through boulders ranging in size from a foot or two across to some twenty feet across.
The climb up was a steep half mile and the trail climbed directly over the summit.  We walked toward the sun in the early morning and the shadows fell long behind us as we summited at 5500 feet.
The way down was less steep but was still three miles of boulder scramble back down to the tree line. When we finally found the tree line it was the first time in the last two days we were back down in the forest.   Climbing a boulder scramble is tiring; going down one is dangerous.  Even though we had scheduled a short distance day it was still long in hours and stressful most of the way down.  But the bottom leveled out and the final miles were a relatively flat, but rocky, walk through the woods. 
We ended the day at Pinkham Notch and Foggy's children met us with doughnuts and coffee for a ride into Gorham where we plan to resupply and take a day off from hiking.  We're done with the Presidential Range - a great relief and we'll be off to the Wildcats on Tuesday. Just for perspective it took us seven days to go from 1700 miles on the trail to 1800 miles. So far we're seven hiking days past 1800 miles and we still have 30 miles until we hit 1900.  It's slow going through the big mountains, but we just keep trying to move forward.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576587,"Doug, Elaine and a third friend, Lynn and her dog Wilson, joined us for the climb up the Wildcat Mountains today. They picked us up in Gorham and we had a big breakfast to fuel up. Of course this meant we got a late start - the usual process when leaving after a zero day.
Because of the late start and the climb we planned another short mileage day.
The first mile is very flat but once we reached the mountain the clb seemed straight up, with a 2000 foot rock scrbe to the top. The Wildcats apparently are a ski area and as we moved along the ridge after the big climb we came across a gondola setup with signs pointing to various ski slopes going down. Our hiker friends considered taking the gondola down but instead decided to hike down what they hoped would be an easier slope.
The rest of the day was more of the same - ups and downs with a number of smaller rock scrambles. We ended the day at about 4:30 at the Carter Notch Hut and we're able to get work for stay at the hut. 
Work for stay is a mixed blessing. Free food and you get to sleep on the floor of a heated space, but you can't set up until after 9:30 and you have to be out by 6:30 the next morning. We weren't so lucky this time with our work assignment. We got spend about an hour scrubbing the black gunk off the bug pans they use for baking, with nothing more than steel wool and warm water. The crew said the pand had to be clean before the season ended and we gave them a good start in the task.
We plan to leave early tomorrow to get back to the trailhead and into town to retrieve a box of food we stored at the motel. The trail travels in strange ways some times. We left Pinkham Notch this morning - one of the access points  to Gorham - and tomorrow we'll get down turn US 2, another Gorham access point on the other side of the town.

We left the hut early, starting our day a little earlier than normal and started up a ridge full of Carters. The climb out of the notch was a typical steep rock climb but it flattened out across toe rdge lone after we got to the top of Carter Dome. The ascent to the dome had several false summits which is frustrating but eventally you get there.
After the Dome you cross South, Middleand North Carter peaks with steep rock climb descents between each. After the Carters there are more very steep climbs down. It's these kind of descents that damage the knees and ankles and I was wondering whether our choice to try our first 15 mile day in the Whites was a good one.
Near the bottom, the last three or so miles it flattens out and I made it to the trailhead after about 10 hours of hiking. Foggy joined me a little later and we started hitching into town. As luck would have it a couple of hikers pulled over to ask us where the White Mountain Hostel is and we pointed ahead about 40 yards. Right place, right time because then they offered us a ride into town, after dropping a package at the hostel.
Back to Gorham, pretty beat up. We'll decide tomorow whether our bodies can get back on the trail or whether another day of rest is needed. I'm told we have about another 40 or so miles of the hard rock climbs so we're thinking twice about trying to preserve our bodies.

The trail took us across four peaks and at every one of them the wind blew so hard it was difficult to walk. At one poin I was blown off my feet but missed injury by landing in a row of bushes along the trail. Every peak was the same and the wind and cold made hiking a misery. The downs were tough as well - steep and rocky and at one point I fell face first to the ground but missed by inches planting my face in the rocks.I'm at the end of the White Mountains but the clbs were still high today and some sections even vertical.

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577209,"The weather improved a bit today which was much needed after yesterday.  But today had its own challenges: the hardest mile on the trail.
After a mile and a half of hiking I reached Mahoosuc Notch which is a mile long jumble of boulders the size of refrigerators and cars. The boulders rest at the bottom of a notch between two mountains and are at least a flat walk. The trail tradition considers this the hardest mile but as a physical challenge it's not too bad.  The real challenge is figuring ot the path to get through. To traverse the pile you have to climb around, over and under boulders and it seems more a puzzle than hard work. It took me an hour and a half to make it through and, while it was an I teresting diversion, I'm glad it's behind me.
After the scramble we went up Maine's first 4000 foot mountain - Old Speck. I had planned to go farther today but the Notch and the climb caused us to pull up short and we tented at a trail crossing.

The only thing that cold mess up the day is if it rained all day long. But Harvey prevailed and it rained all day long. No falls today but there were many fewer tricky down climbs. I'm glad for that. When you fall, even if there's no real injury it still takes a bit of a toll on the body.

Although the terrain is getting easier today's plan is not a big one.  A few big climbs remain and the walk over Saddleback, Horn and Saddleback Junior Mountains slowed me down quite a bit. In each case there was a rocky scramble down the mountain and that's even slower going.
Poplar Ridge Shelter is a sort of landmark on the trail because there is a small memorial to a thru-hiker who was lost in the forest a few years back and was not found until a year or so later, long after she died.  Her trail name was Inchworm and the story is that she left the the trail, became disoriented and was never able to find her way back.  Although every hiker's recollection is different I remember hearing that she survived to make 26 daily journal entries before she died.  
That evening, after dinner and right before we hit the tents for the night a young man with the trail name Pipes played a short concert on his mini bagpipes.  I've heard of Pipes along the way but had not met him and it was fun to listen to the tunes he played.  He said he plays the Highlander Pipes but the mini set allows him to remain in practice and offer a little entertainment for the crowd. It was fun and certainly something unique - only on the trail as the hikers are so often to say.
I'm starting to think about the end of the trail and to count down the days but there are still a couple big climbs ahead.  At this point the goal is to get to Monson and the 100 mile wilderness where the climbs get fewer and the flat trail gets longer.  We've been getting small sections of flat trail which is great for the legs and the spirit and for the next several days the weather is supposed to be sunny and warm.  Thanks for that!","ME 4

The sign at the entry point warns hikers to take 10 days of food but most hikers plan to get through much quicker. I packed out about eight days of food which means I'm carrying the heaviest pack of the entire trip. Until now I think the most food I've packed is six days. But the good news is that every day the pack will get lighter.
There is a general sense that the 100-milw wilderness is pretty flat but the elevation map shows that there are still three or four big climbs and it's not until day four that the trail falttens out. The climbs are not as big as we've been doing through the WhiteMountains but there are still some 2000 foot climbs ahead. The first day of the wilderness has many small ups and downs but no big climbs - we'll save those for days two and three.
Today also provides the first river ford and I'm nervous about testing my fording method. Most hikers carry water shoes the entire trip just for this moment but I didn't see the value in carrying water shoes for over 2000 miles when I knew I wouldn't need them until the very end. I plan to do the fords in my hiking boots. I removed my socks and the insoles and walked through the river. I'm trusting that the shoes will dry out enough that I won't be hiking in wetsocks every day. After this first ford it seems my plans is working. I finished the day with dry feet and only damp socks.
The ford took another toll, however. I waited until everyone got across and I sat besidethe river for over an hour. This caused quite a delay in our plans and I ended up hiking into thecampsite after dark. It's never fun setting up camp and cookingin the dark but there's no choice at this point. Also, at the very end of the hike we saw a sign for trail magic near where we camped so after setting up and cooking I put on my headlight and went to the trail magic well after 8 p.m. I brought the food I cooked at the camp because I wanted to lighten my packweight but I was able to enjoy a cold beer and the company of other hikers.

The day was full of views of Katahdin and I set up my tent along the river with a beautiful view of the mountain behind my tent.  Tomorrow we'll make our way to the Birches and get ready to climb Katahdin the next day.
We're walking in a bubble of about 15 to 20 hikers which makes the staging for the climb to the finish a little iffy.  The Birches is the staging shelter for thru-hikers and only 12 are permitted to stay there each day.  We're trying to figure out how to be part of the 12 because if we aren't then our choices for staying in the park are not good.  One alternative is to find a ride into the town of Millinocket and return the next morning but I'd prefer to not do that at this point.

Today is another beautiful weather day and the 10 miles are flat and easy.  With no worries about where we are tenting tonight the day turned into a leisurely stroll with many stops to enjoy the views and the creek side walk along the trail.  there was even time to chat with day hikers and others curious about the through hike experience.  It was a wonderful day before the final climb up Katahdin.  The day gave me a chance to reflect a bit on the last six months and wonder if, as so many people have told me, in a couple of weeks I'll be missing the trail and wishing I was back out.  As I sat soaking my feet in the ice cold water of a raging creek I thought very much that it would be a long time before I want to get back to the trail.  At least until my feet lose their Flintstone size and the constant ache goes away.
Evening at the Birches was nice as well as the hikers sat around a fire fixing dinner and reminding one another of the adventures we've had along the way.  The small group at the shelter was a mix of people I had met just in the last week or so and people I've known from months ago back in Georgia and North Carolina.  One last night and everyone seemed to be making the best of it.  There was also some talk about whether to take a full pack up the mountain or to use a day pack for water and snacks.  I'm slack packing - making the climb with my day pack.  But for the purists there was a sense that they had carried the big pack for almost 2200 miles so they should finish with it.  And there were those who compromised by carrying their big packs but not any of the gear they wouldn't need for a day's climb up the mountain.  That's part of the trail culture - hike your own hike.  Do what makes sense to you.","Abol Bridge Campground

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578911,"It's hard to capture this last day.  It's only a five mile climb up (and five down) but it's some of the steepest rock climbs we've undertaken so far.  After the fact there was much discussion about whether Katahdin was the hardest climb of the entire trail - I fell on the side of yes.  At the same time there was an excitement that seemed to make the climb more manageable - maybe some adrenalin flowing, knowing this was the final hurdle.
The first couple of miles are relatively easy; a shallow grade up on trails that are pretty easy to walk.   And then the rocks come and it's a very vertical rock scramble seemingly straight up the mountain.  there are places where there are re-bar ladders and hand holds and some places where there should have been.  The final mile is a constant up along a rocky trail - walking, not climbing but still hard because of the rocky tread.
For all of the climb we had been in the sun and it was pleasant, weatherwise. But as we approached the summit clouds rolled in and covered the top of the mountain.  They were so thick it became difficult to see the rock cairns guiding us to the top and we literally walked in a fog wondering when we'd reach the end.  Before too long I heard the noise of a gathering of people and knew I had made it.
There's a funny thng that happens at the top.  The top has a saw horse sign proclaiming KATAHDIN and as I approached I felt like I had to walk up and touch the sign - I stood there (2190.3 miles later) and laid my hand flat on the sign.  I wasn't the only crazy person because as I watched other through hikers come to the summit they all did the same thing.
There were about 40 people at the summit when I got there - almost all were day hikers.  But we congregated with a handful of through hikers and enjoyed the moment.  We snacked, took pictures, shared some stories - all with a profound sense of satisfaction and relief that the journey was over.  Already, I have to admit, I was thinking about how much I'll miss the people I've met along the way.
I made a big mistake on the way down.  Foggy and his daughter and son (who joined us at the top after taking a different trail up) wanted to go down the Knife's Edge.  I agreed, not knowing any better.  I quickly added Knife's Edge to the list of trail names (including Jacob's Ladder and Stairway to Heaven) that one should never hike, if you know what's good for you. The trail took us along a very long ridge made up entirely of a jumble of rocks that made up the summit ridge.  The rocks narrowed to points a couple feet across and I think I crawled more than walked down the thing.  After we left the ridge line we continued down for a total of just over five miles of pretty brutal rock scrambles.  I have to say that it wasn't fun.  I'm glad that I did it but I'd never do it again.
After a very long day I was safe and sound at the bottom and for the most part the trail is done for me.  I still have to go back to Virginia to finish the sixty or so miles I skipped when I injured my hip but that feels more like after school detention than a true part of the trail.  In my head I'm done.  Up until now when a day hiker asked me along the trail whether I was a thru-hiker I would always say that I was trying to be one, but now I am one. And what an experience it's been.","The Birches Shelter

Just Pat for now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578913,"Usually I blog each day separately but the four days back in Virginia seem to blend together.  I was hiking virtually alone most of each day and there were few significant landmarks or happenings along the trail so I'm just going to blend them all together into one post.
I walked northbound one day because I hoped to meet some southbound through hikers and walked southbound three days because the trail was easier that day.  Two things  stood out as I hiked.  the first is that the springs, creeks and rivers that were full of water back in the Spring time are almost empty now.  It seemed to me, compared to what I had experienced in the area back in May, that water was not available.  There were few places where water flowed at all and most water was only available in standing pools. Having never had that experience it was a little scary to me that water was so scarce.  I did talk to a couple of southbound through hikers and they seemed t think it was pretty normal and didn't seem bothered by it at all.
The second thing I noticed is that the hiking is very lonely.  On the day I hiked north I saw eight southbound through hikers, very spread out and all seeming to be walking alone.  One hiker told me that she had camped alone for the last three nights - something that seems never to happen with the northbound group. On the days I walked south I saw only two other through hikers and few day hikers.
I walked past the guillotine - a scary rock formation that required you to walk under a large boulder held aloft by two other bigger boulders.  And I walked across the james River footbridge, the longest foot path only bridge on the Appalachian Trail. I also saw Bobblets Gap Shelter, certainly one of the nicer shelters on the trail.  It's a little like a chalet with a windowed loft and plenty of space for many hikers.  It's built in an L shape which is unique among all the shelters I saw. And I passed a northbound hiker wearing nothing but his tighty whiteys below the waist.  He didn't stop to explain and I didn't chase after him to hear the story!
I finished the hike on day four walking 19.6 miles to Mountain Pass Road, just north of Daleville.  It was farther than I had to walk but it was the only road crossing Linda could get to so I walked the extra miles.  the great weather continued for the four days and I've now gone more than three weeks with no rain and blue skied every day and I'm certainly grateful that I could finish like that.
After school detention is over now and so is the trail.  I hiked the 2190.3 miles (with a few extra thrown in for good measure) and I have to say it is the most physically and emotionally challenging thing I've ever done.  I'm glad it""s over, my legs, feet, ankles and knees will thank me, but there are things and people I will think abut often and for the rest of my life.
I couldn't have done the hike without the three other guys I finished with.  Their support,encouragement, and friendship made the walk all the easier.  I have to thank Foggy, chilli Dog and Barrel for letting me tag along.  They each brought their gifts - Foggy, who at most decisions someone would say what does Foggy think, whose commitment to every blaze, every mile and every step is a role model for us all; Chilli Dog, the southern charmer always quick with a tip or some other help who talked us into more fun experiences than we deserved; and Barrel, our young companion, quick to entertain with his good nature, quick smile and endless knowledge of the 80's.  I will remember these guys for the rest of my life.
I'll conclude by stealing and sharing a bit of wisdom from Foggy.  At one point he said that the journey starts out to be about the trail. At some point it's not about the trail. Instead it's about all the people you meet, all the places you visit and all the experiences you have.  The trail just becomes that path that gets you from one place to another but it's the places that make the experience.  I think he's right.
Countless times people along the trail asked me what was the best part of the trail.  There isn't a best part because every place is unique but all the people I met and places i saw made the trip worthwhile. It was a hard journey but worth every step and I'm still wondering a bit whether the trail will call me back sometime soon.
