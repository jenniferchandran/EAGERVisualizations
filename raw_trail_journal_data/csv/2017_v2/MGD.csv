MGD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518714,"I know very well that plans dont amount to much when taking on such a task as a thru hike. Like we always said in the Corps, ""plan for the plan to fail.” Im on winter break from college now. Ive been so busy with school work that I dont know how to handle all this down time. Could that be a reason for my obsessive planning? Is it just boredom, or is it the fear of the unknown that causes OCD like habits to encroach in on my otherwise carefree, as-it-comes lifestyle?         My gear has been gone through and dissected, scrutinized and revolutionized. I have a 10 lbs summer base weight and I like what I have. It's all been vetted and well used. By now I have memorized every shelter, water source, and burger joint along the entire trail. I know the best places to resupply and what places to send a box to. I think I’ve put more effort on this than I have any research project for college; Im one of those guys that have always done well winging it. You would think the one time that people say it's better to wing it my skill set would shine, but nope. I go the opposite direction with it [I wish I could balance.] Then again, that is the very reason for this adventure.         Yes it is a bucket list, lifelong dream type thing, but one of my main decisions to do it now was to teach myself some patience and humility. To disconnect from first-world problems for a while. The world has gone crazy and I need a break. Seeing news reports of yet another Black Friday with trampling selfishness and greed driven store riots reminds me of why I NEED this trip. I have lost center and perhaps the only way to rebalance is to sit on a mountain top in solitude and ruminate life. Or maybe its the buttkicking challenge of the pilgrimage that changes a soul. Either way, Im ready to get this adventure on the road, ahem, trail. -MGD","

MGD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552151,"I lost track of this journal after I had to get off trail early on when my daughter was hospitalized. Because of the strict time frame with the sections I would have been hiking, spending much of that time with a sick child put an end to my partial section/thruhike. I will be attempting a traditional thruhike this coming season starting early March. I have the time and money so why not do it now?",,Reload,"Dec 05, Mon",0
