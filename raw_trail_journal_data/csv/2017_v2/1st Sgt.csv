1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551758,"Hi,My name is Dave and I will start my thru-hike on 24 February 2017. I know I'm starting just a little bit earlier than most people do but I need to be done by Aug 15 due to another commitment. I'd really like to hear from others who might have advice for me on clothing and shoe (and any other equipment) needs for this time of year.Hiking the Appalachian Trail has been a dream of mine since I was just a boy. My friends and I often hiked and camped on the weekends and sometimes even for a week at a time and we often talked about hiking the AT. But life has a way of taking over. I graduated from high school, joined the military, got married, raised a family, and continued my education but never forgot my dream. Now's the time. I think I'm going to go with 1st Sgt as my trail name. I've been called that as well as Shirt, Top, Diamond 1 (my call sign in Iraq) and Chief by my friends for years. Of course, I might get out on the trail and end up with a totally different name.I've been planning for the hike for more than a year now and have purchased most of my gear. I've done several weekend trips and two longer hikes to test my equipment but suspect I will still be making changes and improvements up until the day I leave for the trail. I did my first ""Longer"" hike on the Lone Star Hiking Trail in Texas in March 2016. The trail is 96 miles long (but by adding all the loops you can do as many as 126 miles). I tried to do 100 miles even but due to high rain and a washed out bridge I ended up doing 107 miles in 8 days. I completed the River to River Hiking Trail in Illinois on Oct 29 2016. It was 170.4 miles and took me 12.5 days to complete. The R2R was much more difficult than the mostly flat Lone Star Trail and I suspect the AT to be harder still.I've got 93 days left before I begin and I'm starting to feel like a kid waiting for Christmas morning.",,Getting Ready!,"Nov 22, Tue",0
1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551767,"The area I live in here in Texas is very flat. I've done several preparation hikes but other than one day hike, none has had much elevation change. I suspect the ups and downs along the trail are going to kick my butt until I get my trail legs. The primary thing I've been doing to prepare is walk on my treadmill. I know its not enough but with my work, right now its about all I have time to do. I do 10 miles at least 5 times a week with 3 of the miles at a slow jog. My goal has been to walk the distance of the Appalachian Trail on my treadmill prior to getting on the trail. Right now I have about 300 miles left to go. I'm hoping to reach my goal just prior to my kickoff date. Starting Friday (the day after Thanksgiving), I plan to increase the incline of the treadmill 1 position on the scale each week. I also plan to restart my diet on Friday. My goal is to drop at least 20 lbs before my start date.",,Getting Ready! Part II,"Nov 23, Wed",0
1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551768,"My plan is for my wife and I to fly to Atlanta, rent a car and drive to the Amicalola area on the 22nd of February. I originally planned on doing this alone but she wants to see me off and it certainly makes the logistics simpler even if it's more expensive. On the morning of the 23rd, she is going to drop me off at the parking lot near the southern terminus of the trail and I'm going to hike back past the starting point and down the approach trail and meet her back at the archway at Amicalola Falls State Park. The next morning, she will once again drop me off at the parking lot and I will officially start my hike.I know I'm starting a little bit earlier in the season than most people start but I really want to be done by 15 Aug. On 21 Aug 2017, a total eclipse is going to cross the United States. The path of totality will cross through SC across the U.S. and finally through Oregon. There has not been a total eclipse of this magnitude to cross the United States in more than 500 years. My little home town, in Southern Illinois is within just a couple of miles of being at the very center of the event. It will be dark longer there than anywhere else in its path. I have reserved a pavilion at Ferne Clyff State Park and have invited all of my friends to attend and watch this once in a lifetime, two and a half minute, eclipse take place. Climbing Katahdin and finishing my hike on the 15th of Aug should give me just enough time to make it to Illinois and prepare for the party.",,An Early Start,"Nov 24, Thu",0
1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554446,"Just two weeks before the start of my hike. I finished my last job today, so now I’m officially (quasi-) retired. I’m both excited and nervous at the same time. I’ve gotten all my gear together but still need to pack. I also need to complete the boxes I’m going to mail to myself along the trail.To physically prepare for the hike, I’ve been walking on my treadmill for the past year. I’ve skipped some days due to work, vacations, appointments, etc., but have managed to knock out more than 2,200 miles. I know the treadmill probably isn’t the best method to use to prepare with but it’s what I’ve got. And, when you’re trying to squeeze in your exercise with the rest of your schedule, having it right in the house is very convenient. I’ve also managed to complete a few day hikes and overnighters during the last year and did one mountain hike to the top of Guadalupe Peak with my wife (about 8,400 feet). In addition to those, I completed a 107 mile hike on the “Lone Star Hiking Trail” north of Houston, Texas, in March and a 170 mile hike on the River-to-River Hiking Trail in the Shawnee National Forest in Southern Illinois in September.When I tell family and friends about my trip, I often receive the same questions. I thought I would take a little bit of time here to answer the most common ones.Why am I doing this? This is probably the hardest question I get. And, to be totally truthful, I’m not sure I can explain all the reasons or even know all the reasons I want to do this. Let’s just say, this is something I’ve always wanted to do. I’ve dreamt about it my entire life. I remember as a kid, hiking and camping with my friends and talking about doing this hike. Like almost everybody else, I grew up, finished school, got married, got a job, and raised my children. But, the dream never went away. Now, I’ve finally gotten my chance!Who are you going with? Like just about everybody else, I’m doing this by myself. Think about if for just a moment. Do you know anyone that you want to be with for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for 6-months straight? And if you do, do they share the same passion for the adventure as you do? And, are they at the same point in their life where they can get away for 6 months? If you do know someone like this, consider yourself very lucky because there are very few people who do. I’m hiking by myself, but I won’t be alone. There are about 4000 people who attempt a thru-hike each year (the whole trail in one year). Of this 4000, about 20-25% finish the hike. There are about 3 million people who day-hike or section-hike a portion of the trail each year. I doubt there will be a day that I won’t see at least somebody on the trail. And, I suspect, I will get to know quite a few people along the way. We are all going the same way on the same trail and at about the same speed. Even though I probably won’t be hiking with them specifically, I’m sure we will meet up time and again along the way. I’m actually looking forward to it.How far is it? The trail is approximately 5,000,000 steps. It passes through 14 states along the way. It goes up and down for approximately 464, 464 feet along its length. That’s equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest 16 times. This year it is 2,190.3 miles long; it changes slightly each year due to minor changes in the trail (often due to fires or erosion control). That’s further than the distance from San Antonio, TX, to Chicago, IL, and back or just about the same distance as San Antonio to Seattle, WA.How long does it take? I expect to take about 174 days to complete my hike. I will start on the 24th of Feb and hope to finish by 15 Aug. My plan is to take one day off each week and an additional day off each month to rest, recuperate, re-supply, laundry, sleep in a real bed, and eat. These days of non-hiking are known as a “Zeros”. A day of almost no hiking is a “Nero”. To meet my goal, I need to average 15 miles a day. This includes the days I’m not hiking. So, I actually need to walk about 18 miles a day to break even.Where will you start and finish your hike? I plan to start my hike at the approach trail in Amicalola Falls State Park in Northern Georgia. The actual official starting point of the AT is about a mile away from the nearest road so many people, myself included, start their hike at the park headquarters about 8.5 miles south. I will end my hike at the top of Mt. Katahdin in Baxter State Park in north-central Maine. Since I’m headed North, I will be known as a Nobo. About 80% percent of the thru-hikers will start in Georgia and go north. Most of the rest will start in Maine and head south. They are known as Sobos. A few, known as flip-floppers, will either start in the middle and head north or start in the south and go to the middle then catch a ride to the north end and come back south. There are pros and cons to each method but starting in the south and heading north will allow me to start earlier in the year.Are you taking a gun, a knife, or a dog as protection? No. Actually, I will be carrying a small knife. It has a 2.5 inch blade and will be used primarily to open plastic food bags and to spread peanut butter (I’m also not carrying a fork…but I will have a spoon!) What about bears!!!? There are bears, wild boars, moose, coyotes, etc., on the trail. As for bears, if I’m lucky, I might get to see one…from a safe distance. From my reading, I’ve learned, that almost always, a black bear will leave you alone if you don’t get too close or get between it and its cubs. I plan to work very hard to keep a safe distance. I’ve been told, loud singing along the trail lets the bears know you are there and gives them plenty of time to get out of the way. I’ve also been told that “Gospel Songs” work best. To keep bears away from me when I’m sleeping, I plan to hang all my food, and anything that smells like food, in a tree a good distance away from my tent. As I get further north, there are moose on the trail. They should be considered about as dangerous as the bears. I can also expect to see rattlesnakes, copperheads, and other non-poisonous snakes. I plan to watch where I walk and sit. My biggest animal fear on the trail are “deer ticks”. I’ve already contacted Lyme disease once and would really hate to get it again. To keep them, and other insect pests away, I’ve sprayed all my clothing with Permethrin and plan to reapply it several times along the trail. Overall, statistically, I’m much safer on the trail than I would be walking through any city in the country.What will you eat or where will you get your food? I expect my dinners will mostly consist of lots of Raman Noodles, Tuna, Knorr’s Sides, Instant Massed Potatoes, Spam (Hiker’s Steak), Mac-N-Cheese, and Peanut Butter. Much of this will often be eaten with, or spread on, a flour tortilla. I’ve also purchased quite a few of the dehydrated camping meals over the past year for this trip. Most of them are surprisingly good and will add variety to my diet. Lunch will probably be spread out throughout most of the day and will usually be in the form of nuts, dried fruit, some form of power bar or Cliff Bar, and chocolate. Breakfast will almost always be instant oatmeal, instant coffee, and possibly a cup of hot chocolate (actually a meal replacement drink). Some, probably about 25%, of my food will be mailed to me at different locations along the trail. The rest I will purchase at trail towns, hostels, gas stations, and convenience stores along the way. My wife also plans to visit me about once a month and will resupply me each time. Without her assistance, both mailing packages and bringing me a resupply, this trip would be much more difficult. As often as easily possible, I will eat in towns along the way. This will also add variety and give me a chance to add some fresh fruit and vegetables (and an occasional beer) to my diet.All of this will usually be washed down with lots of water. I’m carrying a Sawyer Water Filter designed to remove anything in the water that might make me sick. I will also carry some water treatment pills too to be used if my filter fails. I’ve got a very handy trail guide that, in addition to other important information, shows me the location of water sources along the trail.What will you wear? Basically, the same clothes every day. For the hiking day, I plan to carry one pair of pants (the legs can be zipped off to make them shorts), one shirt, light-weight thermal underwear, two pair of socks, and two pair of underwear. I am bringing two caps. One is a normal cap that hopefully will keep the sun out of my eyes and keep my bald head from sunburn and a knit cap to keep my head warm. I also have a rain jacket and rain pants and a down jacket, and gloves. For night wear, I have another pair of socks, a mid-weight set of thermals, and a pair of running shorts. I will also have a light pair of sandals I can wear in camp and to cross streams. As winter turns to spring and then to summer, I will send most of my cold weather gear home. I hope to wash everything at least once a week…probably while wearing my rain gear in a laundromat. Actually, I’ve read that many of the hostels and hotels along the trail supply “loaner” clothes while you do your laundry.I expect I will go through 4-5 pairs of footwear along the way. I’m starting out in a pair of mid-height waterproof boots but will change to trail shoes as the weather warms up. Will you have a phone for emergencies? I plan on carrying my cell phone on the trip. I use Verizon as my carrier and have been told, that at least in the first half of the trip, it gets much better reception than other companies. I hope to text and/or call my family and update my journal every day. But, I’m also carrying a locator device called a Spot. Since it works off satellite instead of cell towers, I should be able to send a prerecorded message to my family at the end of each day. Basically, just an “I’m Okay” and my GPS coordinates. It also has an emergency button (kind of like calling 911) I can activate if I, or anybody else, has a life threatening injury or illness.How much does your pack weigh? Counting food and water, about 40-45 lbs. at the start of my hike. After the weather warms up, I think I can reduce my load by about 15 lbs. when I send my cold weather gear home and replace my sleeping bag with a summer bag. With less gear, I can also change out for my smaller pack. This will allow me to shave another pound off my overall weight.My phone will also be my camera, my Kindle, and my backup flashlight. I have a PDF version of the trail journal downloaded and a neat little program that gives me the weather conditions all along the trail. I’m carrying a backup battery to recharge my phone but will probably turn the phone off most of the time to conserve the battery. In addition to my phone, I’m also carrying my iPod. My iPod has about 36 hours of music (mostly 60-80s Rock) recorded on it and 50 movies.Where will you sleep? I’m carrying a two-person tent that I plan to sleep in most nights. I considered a one-person tent but finally decided that the extra 8 ounces would be worth the extra room. My opinion may change somewhere along the way. There are approximately 260 shelters along the trail. Most of these are three-sided and sleep about 8 people. Depending on the circumstances, I may use these on occasion. As with most things, there are pros and cons each way. About once a week, I plan to stay in a hostel or hotel. This will give me the opportunity to re-supply, do laundry, shower, eat real food, and sleep in a real bed.Where will you go to the bathroom? The same place as a bear. Many of the shelters are supposed to have outhouses but most are very primitive. Some don’t even have walls. I’m carrying a little shovel for all the other times. I’ve been told, that you have a whole new appreciation for porcelain by the end of the trip. Don’t you have a job? Nope, not anymore! I’ve shut down my business but will maintain my license and insurance for the next couple of years. I’m not sure if I will start it back up when I’m done with the hike.And you do this for fun? Yes!!!!!!!",,2 Weeks to Go,"Feb 10, Fri",0
1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555006,"My wife and I arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park today after an 1100 mile drive from our home in Texas (half the distance I plan to walk in the next few months). I plan to hike the approach trail tomorrow. My wife will pick me up and we will spend one more evening at the lodge. She will then drop me off at the top of Springer Mountain on Friday. We drove up to the parking lot near the starting point this afternoon just to check it out and to make sure it was passible in my truck. It has been raining here for the last couple of days but we had no real problem with the road in two-wheel drive. It was so foggy on the second half of the trip up that we couldn't see more than about 50 feet in front of the truck but I never felt the need to place my truck in four-wheel drive and there was even a couple of cars in the parking lot.Several people today asked me if I was a thru-hiker. Even though I answered yes, I was hesitant in my response. To me, it seems a little premature to claim that title yet. For the foreseeable future, I think I'm just going to tell folks I'm a day-hiker. I just plan to do it every day for about the next 170 days. Right now, I have conflicting emotions about this grand adventure. I’m excited to get started and am looking forward to the challenge, but at the same time, I’m nervous and fearful of just about everything. Have I forgotten anything I can’t do without? Do I have the physical ability and mental fortitude to do this? I know I’m going to miss my wife, children, and grandchildren but also know I have their support. As I’ve tried to teach my children….all you can do is your best. I just have to keep in mind that this is not the hardest or grandest journey I’ve ever undertaken. I’ve helped to raise 5 children and they all came out wonderful.Tonight and tomorrow night, my wife and I are staying in the lodge at Amicalola Falls. We are safe, dry, and warm and if the restaurant downstairs is any good, soon to be well-fed.","Amicalola Falls State Park

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555056,"I’d like to claim that I spent the day hiking on the Appalachian Trail but most of the day was on the approach trail. Only about a mile of my day was on the actual trail. The “Official Appalachian Trail” starts and ends in the middle of the woods. Here in Georgia, there is an 8.3 mile “Approach Trail” starting at Amicalola Falls State Park. Some hikers use the approach trail and others start at a road crossing about a mile into the trail, walk south for a mile, and then turn around and head north. In my opinion, neither way is incorrect as long as you walk the entire trail and pass every ""White Blaze"". As in just about every hobby, hiking the Appalachian Trail has its own language, known by other hikers but mostly unknown to the general public (muggles…if you are a geocacher). A ""White Blaze"" is a a white rectangle about 6 inches long usually painted on a tree (or a rock, a post, even the bottom of a canoe) that signifies you are on the AT. Another common acronym/phrase on the trail is “HYOH” or “Hike Your Own Hike”. This basically means “do things your own way”.This morning, my wife dropped me off at a road crossing about a mile from where the trail starts and I hiked south on the trail for about a mile and then followed the approach trail back to the park. Tonight we are back in our room at the lodge. Tomorrow morning, she will drop me back at the road crossing. I will head north on the trail and she will drive back to Texas. Even though my wife is not too thrilled about me doing this hike, she was willing to take the time off work, come with me all the way from Texas, drive my truck on wet, slippery, steep, very narrow mountain roads (with big drop-offs), shrouded in fog to pick me up and drop me off and then drive back to Texas alone shows just how much she supports me in this adventure. I don’t expect to see her again for about a month when she plans to come visit me somewhere along the trail.So tomorrow, my adventure really begins. For the next few days, I will sleep in shelters or in my tent as I work my way north For the first one hundred miles or so, I plan to try to go about 10 miles per day and, as I get my “Trail Legs”, I hope to gradually increase to an average of 15 miles a day. I want to end this post with a phrase used by “Slipknot” on all of his posts last year during his successful thru-hike. ""Tonight I’m safe, warm, and dry."" Goodnight.","Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555095,"I finished the hike today at Hawk Mountain Shelter and am now sheltered for the night in my tent. I only hiked 8.1 miles but the next shelter is 8 miles further and 16 miles is just too far for my first day. It seemed strange stopping at 1pm but it allowed me time to work out a few bugs in my system and to meet a few fellow hikers.There are 4 others with me here at Hawk Mountain. Bearbag (trail name) thru-hiked the trail last year and is rehiking the first 150 miles again with his buddy Bill. There is also Dave from Phoenix and Dan from Boston. Bearbag, Bill, and Dave are all retired military. Bearbag and Bill were both Army helicopter pilots and Dave was in the Navy. Dan is 20 years old. He is from Boston and needs to finish by early August to start back at college in the fall. With the exception of Bearbag, the rest seem as excited as I am and all are convinced they will make it to Mount Katahdan. I hope we are all right but statistics show only one of us will complete the entire hike... I'm voting for me!Similar to geocaching, thru-hikers usually go by a nickname, in this case a trail name. You can pick your own or wait for someone to pick it for you. The second method may be more traditional but beware, you might not like the name you end up with. My geocaching moniker has been 1st Sgt for several years so I'm going to try to continue using it but I'll let you know if it changes. Bearbag received his trail name last year when others found out how well he could throw a line over a tree to haul up his food bag to protect it from bears at night. He was hiking with several others and they would call him for help when they were trying to do the same (I know from experience, it's not as easy as it sounds but tonight this site has a bear box, so my food is in it). The other three do not have trail names yet, but I'm sure they will before too many days pass.Well, enough for tonight. It's long past ""hikers midnight"". The owls are serenading me and tomorrow will be another long hike on the AT (I'm still having a hard time believing I'm actually here and starting my 6 month adventure). Tonight all is well. I am safe, warm, and dry. I couldn't ask for more. Goodnight.","Lodge

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555146,"Lightning and thunder woke me this morning at about 5:45. It had not started raining yet, and since my alarm was set for 6:00, I decided to go ahead and pack up to beat the rain. But I was still working inside the tent when it started to rain. By the time I was done packing, finished eating my morning oatmeal, and drinking my instant coffee and had brushed my teeth, the rain was intermittent.I spent a few minutes talking with the others at the campsite and began my hike at 7:45. Almost immediately, the sun popped out and the day was beautiful even if it was about 20 degrees cooler than yesterday. The cool weather was appreciated because soon after starting I had to climb Sassafras Mountain. It was a tough, long climb up and then down the other side. Even though not quite as high as the first, I thought Justus Mountain was even worse.I arrived at Hooch Mountain Shelter around 2:30 and spread out my tent to dry in the sun. That only made for about an 8-mile day but the next shelter is 12 miles ahead….20 miles a day is just too much for me at this point. Apparently, others felt the same because there are now about 12 people at this campsite.Basically, you can camp just about anywhere you want over much of the AT but it is recommended you stay at the designated sites. You can stay in the shelter or pitch your tent at one of the tent sites. Water is ordinarily close by and there is usually a ""privy"" available.The temperature tonight is supposed to drop to 26 degrees. I've been down to this temperature once before with my equipment and managed to stay comfortable. I hope tonight will be the same.It is beginning to get dark. I've had my dinner and cleaned up the best I can with my wet wipes. It is almost hiker's midnight and everyone in camp has now settled down in their tents or in the shelter. So far tonight, I'm safe, dry and ""warm"". I'm also really enjoying the trip so far and the people I have gotten to meet. Goodnight all.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555228,"I've been hiking with two guys I met on the trail. Bear Bag (Paul) hiked the trail last year and is hiking the first 150 again this year with his friend Bill. Bill will continue on to Mount Katahdan. It has been really great to meet up with them. Both are retired Army, both came out of a Special Forces type unit, both were paratroopers, and both ended up as helicopter pilots. It's been an honor to hike with them. Both are also 10 years younger than me so I feel pretty good about the fact that I've managed to keep up...just barely (or they are just being nice, but I'll take it either way.)We ended the day at Blood Mountain Shelter. It was about 3 miles further than we had originally planned but the stream was dry at the last shelter. They are calling for rain in the morning and this also gets us closer to our resupply at Neel Gap. Maybe we can beat the rain.Blood Mountain is the highest shelter in Georgia and also the oldest. It was built of stone by Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) workers in the 1930. Blood Mountain is also the highest mountain we have to climb in Georgia at about 4,400 feet.We are sharing the shelter tonight with three other hikers--Rose, Ryan, and William. All three are about 20. They make me even more proud of this generation. All three are obviously very smart, very polite, and have their acts together.Tonight is supposed to drop down to about 35 degrees but I am warm, dry, and safe. Goodnight.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555274,"Headed into rain coming off of Blood Mountain this morning. It's amazing how fast the weather can change. It was cold but beautiful when I started hiking this morning and it was raining two hours later.Luckily, I was planning to stop at Mountain Crossing Outfitters anyway. Mountain Crossing is the first real opportunity to stop and resupply without actually leaving the trail. It is also the only building from Georgia to Maine that the trail actually passes through. Mountain Crossing sells everything you might have forgotten to bring with you. And, in my opinion, the prices were actually pretty reasonable considering its location. I met three of the staff while I was there and they were all very nice and professional without being too pushy. For a $1 donation, they allow hikers to mail packages to them and they will hold them until you come through. I had my resupply waiting for me. They have a bunk room and/or showers and laundry service available too. Best of all, they will mail a box home for you too. I was able to get rid of almost 4 lbs of stuff that I just couldn't do without...that is until I started carrying it.My original plan was for two more days of hiking and then I was going to take a ""Zero"" day to rest and recuperate. But due to the rain, my new friends and I decided to take a ""Nero"" here instead. Just 2 1/2 miles today but at least our gear is dry and so are we. Right now I'm full of pizza and spending the night at Blood Mountain Cabins. Tonight I'm safe, I'm dry, and I'm warm. Goodnight.","Blood Mountain Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555355,"I started my hike this morning from the Blood Mountain Cabins at Neel Gap. It hadn't been my intention to stop there yesterday but with the rain it seemed like a good idea and turned out to have been the right thing too. I shared the cabin with Bear Bag and Bill. It cost us each $25 but it included them doing our laundry too. The cabin had two bedrooms and a fold down couch so it worked out perfectly.It was still lightly raining this morning but it was time to move on and by 8:00 it was over. I made it to ""Low Gap Shelter"" at around two with thunder booming off in the distance. The rain started again about the same time I got my gear settled for the evening.Today I experienced my first ""Trail Magic"". At a road crossing we met a man with the trail name ""Lion-Hearted"" passing out cold drinks, fruit, snack cakes, and other goodies. Lion-Hearted is a Vietnam War Helicopter Veteran who enjoys meeting hikers and comes out for a couple of weeks each year just to pass out goodies. You just don't meet folks like this every day. I enjoyed a banana, an oatmeal cookie, and a Gatorade (and a great few minutes with a fellow veteran) before moving on.Tonight, I'm sharing the shelter with 6 others from all over the country. I believe we probably have room for one more but might need to squeeze in a few more if the weather continues to worsen.But, tonight I'm warm, I'm safe, and so far, I'm dry.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555434,"What a past 24 hours...Both good and bad.Unfortunately, Bear Bag, one of the guys I've been hiking with, had to leave the trail today. His knee had been swollen and stiff the last few days. It was only getting worse and he had also developed a bad cough. He completed a thru-hikers last year and was only planning to hike to Franklin this year with Bill so the risk of serious injury wasn't worth a few more days of hiking. He is a great guy with tons of experience and trail knowledge...he will be missed.On a funny note...I met a young hiker at the shelter last night name Kate. We were talking and she told me she had left a large container of Parmesan cheese in the ""hiker's box"" back at Neels Gap, explaining it was just too heavy to carry. A little later, I was preparing my camping meal of lasagna and I noticed Kate was preparing spaghetti. I stated ""I bet some of your Parmesan would sure go good with these meals"". Another hiker, a young lady named Rebecca from Switzerland, had just walked into camp and heard my comment. “Parmesan, I have Parmesan”, she said. Kate and I looked at each other and I asked Rebecca, “Where did you get the cheese? Of course, Rebecca replied, ""From the hiker's box at Neels Gap"". Kate and I started laughing and Rebecca just looked at us confused until we explained what had happened. Needless to say, we all had Parmesan cheese with our dinners.On a broken equipment note...my air mattress failed to hold air last night and has already gone flat as I lay here typing this post. On the surface, that just sounds like an uncomfortable night's sleep but my air mattress and sleeping bag are an integrated system with the mattress supplying all the insulation under me. I suspect this is going to end up being a very cold night.I also broke a shoulder strap on my backpack just before entering the campsite tonight. I've attempted a repair using paracord. Tomorrow I’ll find out if it will work. Both problems will require a trip into town and both items may require replacement.Today was my first 15-mile day! It was exhausting! I've gone further in a day on other hikes but nothing with terrain this tough. Tomorrow is also supposed to be another 15-miler but my broken backpack may dictate otherwise.We also received, and are still receiving, a severe storm. It has rained a little off and on all day but as soon as I finished setting up my tent here on top of Tray Mountain, the sky opened up first with heavy rain and then with dime-size hail. Now, more than three hours later, the precipitation appears to have stopped but the wind must be blowing in excess of 25 mph. Much less than it was, but I still have concerns for my tent and I won’t have an opportunity to prepare my dinner.Let me end this post with…so far tonight, I am warm, dry, and safe and excited about the possibility of hiking in the sunshine tomorrow.

I'm planning on taking a ""Zero"" day tomorrow to rest and try to make a more permanent repair to my backpack strap. The expedient repair I made on top of Tray Mountain last night actually worked out pretty well, and I believe, with a little tweaking, it might last the trip. Tonight's temp is supposed to be in the low 20s and tomorrow night it is supposed to get down to 14 degrees. Overall, a good time to take a zero and do some repairs. I was also able to purchase a new air mattress. I didn't really want to spend the money this early in the hike but I had budgeted for equipment failure during the hike so I'm okay.The rain finally stopped last night at around 9:30 but the wind never let up. It continued to gust all night and all through the morning. I had to leave the tent twice during the night to re-secure my stakes. It got very cold. My tent poles go through grommets at the bottom corners of my tent and the ends of the poles touch the ground. This morning my poles were frozen to the ground and when I jerked them free, a ball of frozen mud came with them. I had to break the frozen mud free between two rocks before I could remove the tent from the poles. On the other hand, the wind had blown most of the water from the rest of the tent.Tonight, I caught the shuttle from the hostel to the town of Hiawassee. It appears to be a very nice town but is where the movie ""Deliverance"" was filmed. We were informed by the hostel owner that banjo and pig jokes would not be considered funny by the locals.The owner also congratulated us on our perseverance so far. According to him, by this point, 1/4 of the people who started the hike have quit.I did not get the pizza and beer I wanted for dinner but went to an all you can eat (AYCE) country buffet restaurant instead. The food was excellent and it only cost about $10.Tonight, I'm safe, dry, warm and well-fed. Goodnight from the AT.","Tray Mountain Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555545,"False summits. One of nature's dirty little tricks! Just as your head pops over what you thought was the top of the mountain, you realize the summit is still about another 400 yards further and another 100 yards higher. This might repeat itself 4 or 5 times before you actually reach the top. It appears the folks who laid out the trail didn't want anyone to miss the absolute top. Every now and then, the trail will turn left or right just long enough to make you start believe you are going around the peak. Just when you think you're safe, the trail makes a hard turn back towards the summit.I crossed into North Carolina today! Woot! Woot! I'm on my second state! For the next approximately 300 miles, I will move back and forth between North Carolina and Tennessee. According to ""Sir Packsalot"" at Top of Georgia Hostel, often the only way to tell which state you are in is that NC shelters have privies and TN shelters do not.Tonight, it’s supposed to drop down to 14 degrees. I've never used this equipment down that low before. Hopefully, I can stay comfortable…at least the trees around this camp site are blocking the wind. I have a liner for my sleeping bag that is supposed to add ""up"" to 25 degrees of protection. I guess if it provides more than that I can return it, otherwise, it's mine.Right now, I'm in my tent.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555610,"I've reached my campsite tonight near the ""Carter Gap Shelter"" and I am tenting again. The shelter is nice and looks like it could easily sleep 7 or 8 people but I prefer my tent. In my tent, I have a routine and I know where each item goes every night making it quick and easy to get to. It's almost like having your own little house in the woods to come back to each night. In the shelter, everyone is often crammed together and everything continues to shift as more hikers arrive and try to squeeze into the available space. You get to listen to all kinds snores and other bodily noises throughout the night and/or be woken each time someone gets up to go to the bathroom. There are also mice in the shelters and a much better chance of catching any illness someone might be spread. On the plus side though, it's quick and easy to set up for the night and pack up in the morning, and it provides protection from rain and snow. I prefer my tent, but I will use the shelters on occasion.Today, I completed my first mile-high mountain when I reached the summit of ""Standing Indian Mountain"" at 5,435 feet. It was a great climb up and back down the other side. The trail was smooth, the climb was gradual, and the weather was perfect after being so cold last night.There are some lessons in life I've had to learn repeatedly. For the last two days, I've really been dragging and I’ve been totally exhausted at the end of each day. This morning, I took the time to eat breakfast and my whole world changed. The miles were much easier and I have much more energy tonight than I've had on the other nights. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day and I've known that most of my life.I'm no longer hiking with Bill. He stayed back in Hiawassee yesterday to meet up with his wife and son. He is going to hike with his son for the next week. With a little luck and careful planning, we might meet up again later up the trail. Who knows, maybe we'll complete this hike together.You meet a wide range of people on the trail. I spent some miles today hiking and talking with a guy who goes by the name of “Grizzly”. Grizzly appears to be in his late 20s and has spent the last few years teaching physics. He felt his life needed more so last year he quit his job and hiked the AT. This year he is back to complete the 80 or so miles that were closed last year due to the fires.I also met a young lady who told me that as soon as she is done hiking, and gets her GED, she is going to join the Army and become a Seal. She figures she can start as a Major and work her way up to Gunny Sergeant in a couple of years. Back in my days working in recruiting, I felt I was pretty good at flipping a potential candidate to the Air Force instead, but this young lady was so adamant about what she wanted that I let it slide and didn't even mention the AF.   I'm sure my Army buddies appreciate that.I also want to thank everyone who is following my posts. I love reading the emails and appreciate all the advice and support. I would like to respond to everyone but just can't. I often write my post and it takes hours to send. Maybe, as I get further up the trail, I will get a better signal.Tonight, I am in my sleeping bag in my tent. It's cold again with an expected low of 21, but I'm warm, dry, and safe.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555773,"After a good night's sleep at Gooder Grove Hostel, I was back on the trail by 9 am this morning. I would have much rather started out earlier but it is just one of the consequences of staying in town. The shuttle comes when it comes.I hiked just about 15 miles today over Silver Bald at 5,001 ft. and Wayah Bald at 5,342 ft. A bald is a mountain with no trees at the top. Nobody seems to know why, although there are many different opinions on whether these are natural or not. We do know; however, they have been this way for at least 300 years.I spent the entire day by myself and only passed a few people on the trail. The small group of young folks I had been hiking/camping near all decided to take a “Zero” in town. I'm sure I will see most of them again up the trail.While hiking by myself today, I got to thinking about a slogan often heard on the trail ""Hike Your Own Hike"". Many people will tell you that it basically means mind your own business and let me decide for myself what constitutes my thru-hike. I believe it can mean this but also a whole lot more too. The trail is a great equalizer. It doesn't matter if you're young or old, rich or poor, male or female. It doesn't matter if you are a middle-aged housewife or the CEO of a fortune 500 company. Nobody else can hike your hike for you. It is your journey to make. I also spent a lot of time contemplating my purpose in doing this. That answer may take a few more hundreds of miles to totally figure out. I'll let you know.For the last 3 days, I've hiked through areas that were burned in last year's forest fires. Today, it rained most of the day and it is supposed to rain much of tomorrow too. If I have my druthers, I'll gladly take the rain.Tonight, I'm in my tent on the north side of Wayah Bald.

But, as they say, ""No Rain, No Maine"". As far as I’m concerned...you can add ""No Pain"" to the saying.I stopped at about 3pm due to the rain but did manage to complete the miles I had scheduled. I could have probably made it in to the Nantahala Outdoor Center, otherwise known as “NOC”, but the trail was slippery and I was ready to get out of the rain.I only saw one other person on the trail today. As every good hiker knows, most of the weight of your pack should rest on your hips and not on your shoulders. Unfortunately for me today, my shirt came untucked and my pack was beginning to wear a hot spot on my hip. Typically, when this happens, I take my pack off, re-tuck my shirt, and then re-don my pack. Today, for some reason, I thought I could do it without removing my pack. I undid my hip belt, then my pants, and as I was trying to hold my pack away from my shirt and tuck my shirt, my pants begin to slip. Now, I'm standing bowlegged, trying to keep my pants from falling further when a man about my age comes around the bend. He immediately saw my situation, smiled at me, and said, ""Shirt come untucked?"" Yes. ""Thought you could re-tuck it without removing you pack?"" Yes. ""Been there, it doesn't work."" Yeap. Then as he passed me, he laughed and said, ""But I didn't get caught with my pants half down"". Oh well, it could have been worse.Tomorrow, the rain is supposed to end and the sun is supposed to shine.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555914,"I slept in a shelter last night. I've said in previous post that I prefer my tent, and I do, but last night was definitely the night for a shelter. It poured most of the night and the noise of the rain on the tin roof was almost deafening. At about 4am I was awoken by silence. It was like a switch had been turned off. The difference was so sudden, it actually woke me up.At about 5:30, I got up to use the privy and was amazed by the number of stars that were visible. I haven't seen a sky like this since doing some survey work on a Pacific island years ago, where there was no electricity for hundreds of miles around. I stayed up until dawn, just to watch the sky.I hiked about 6 miles to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) this morning in glorious sunshine, and arrived just before noon. The trail crosses right through the parking lot. Most of my gear was wet (and smelly) from the rain so I decided to stop, pick up my resupply, clean my equipment, and do my laundry. Since that would take at least a couple of hours, I decided to go ahead and get a room for tonight. I also enjoyed a very nice lunch, shower, and dinner too. This puts me about 6 miles behind schedule but this trip is all about the journey, not the destination.My pack hasn't been resting on my shoulders quite right since I broke the strap so I figured it was time to look for a replacement buckle while I was here. The original buckle had been sewn in so it wasn't a simple fix. Once I found some parts I thought might work, I asked the salesperson if I could return them if they didn't fit. Better yet, he told me to bring my pack in and we would make something work. We must have spent nearly a half hour working on the repair. I believe it is now better than the original and it only cost me $6. The folks here are incredible. They may be doing this to earn a living but you can tell they love doing it. So far, I have found this type of attitude all along the trail. I asked a 27-year old, who had hiked the trail last year, what was the biggest thing you gained on your journey? He answered that the trail had renewed his faith in humanity. I hope to be as lucky.Tonight, I am safe, warm, and dry in my little room at the NOC. Tomorrow, I head towards Fontana Dam.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556001,"Tonight, I am tenting at Locust Cove Gap about 2.5 miles past Cheoah Bald making my day’s mileage about 10.4 miles. I had planned to go a little further, but I received word the spring at the next campsite is dry. Still, not too shabby considering most of the day was hiking uphill. I'm not really sure how the math works out, but I've come to the conclusion that it’s about a 5 to 1 ratio--5 ups for every down. I should be at about 30,000 feet by now but my guide is insisting I'm only at 3,642. Oh well, math was never my strong suit.Tonight, for dinner, I had Savory Tuscan Stew with Parmesan Polenta. I mention it for a few different reasons. 1. It was very good. I stumbled across a company online called ""Packit Gourmet"" a few months ago, and decided to try some of their meals. Most of them cost around $8 each, a little expensive, but all have been excellent and, if you have a smaller appetite or add any kind of sides/desert, will probably feed two. 2. I believe even if you are hiking on a budget, you should treat yourself every so often. There is only so much ramen and Knorr’s that you can take and this is still cheaper than going into town. And, 3. Most are prepared exactly like I want to cook. I really appreciate ""Freezer Bag"" cooking. All I use my pot for is to boil water. I add the boiled water to my dehydrated meal in a freezer bag and then slip the bag into my insulated bag cozy. I let it rehydrate for about 10 minutes and it's ready to eat. My used bag goes into my trash bag to be carried out. Nothing to cleanup, no dirty pot, and, in my opinion, much more sanitary than reusing an unwashed pot over again. And, just in case you're concerned, Ziploc brand freezer bags don't contain BPAs.Most of the campsites in Georgia had either bear boxes or bear cables to prevent bears from getting your food. But so far, most of the sites here in NC do not. Each evening you must find a tree far enough away from the campsite to be safe, but close enough to be convenient. It needs to have a horizontal limb at least 10 feet off the ground and you must throw a line over the limb and draw your food bag up into the tree. Sounds easy, but it often isn't. The line tends to tangle in everything, making it sometimes frustrating and often embarrassing if others are watching. Tonight, I managed to toss mine perfectly on the very first throw. Of course, nobody was here to see it but I mentally congratulated myself as I walked back to my tent. Upon reaching my tent site, I heard a limb snap in the direction of my bag. Sure enough, my bag was sitting on the ground under the broken limb under the tree. It took me about 10 tries on the second go-around and, of course, two other hikers arrived while I was attempting to rehang my bag. Oh well, somebody has to provide the entertainment!Tonight, I'm warm, dry, and safe. Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC)

If the weather cooperates, I will enter the Smokies on Monday. Right now, they are calling for heavy snow so my Zero may need to be extended a day or two.

This morning was cold and cloudy and it looked like it was going to storm again at any time. It wasn't until 10:55 that I saw any break in the clouds at all and after 12 before I saw any sunshine. Even then, the weather stayed cold enough all day that I need to wear my jacket to stay warm. The low for tonight is supposed to drop down to the middle twenties. Everything I have feels slightly damp from last night's rain so staying comfortable might be difficult.Today, I had my first hard fall. Everything was wet from last night's rain and I stepped on a large flat rock on the trail and my feet totally came out from under me. I imagine, if I had been looking, I could have read the brand name stenciled on the heal of my shoes. Luckily, I landed on my pack; nothing hurt but my pride. This is all it takes sometimes to finish one's hike, just one little slip.This is also the first time I've camped on this trip where I've had absolutely no cell service. Usually, I can email my post to my wife and she (fixes my typos and) posts it to Trail Journals. I'll go ahead and send this out, but she probably won't receive it/post it until tomorrow. On the other hand, I also carry a GPS locator called a ""Spot"". With just a push of a button, my family knows I'm safe and where I'm at. I can also use it to call for emergency help if needed. I highly recommend you have one of these devices if you ever decide to take a long hike or similar trip. They are relatively inexpensive and go a long way towards alleviating concerns.One last note.

Due to the incoming storm, by the time I was able to contact the Inn, they were out of space. Even though I didn't stay there, the owner offered to deliver my resupply box to the lodge. I really appreciate her kindness. My plan to rest a day, and the arrival of the storm at the same time, was a very lucky happenstance.I almost feel guilty staying at the lodge. This is a beautiful place and by itself, would make a great vacation destination. I just had a late lunch at the Fontana Pitstop and am looking forward to dinner in the main restaurant.The local weather channels are calling for 8-12 inches with more in the mountains. Many/most of the younger hikers decided to press on regardless of the weather warnings. I'd like to think that ""With age comes wisdom!"", but, closer to the truth might be ""With age comes a credit card and more expendable cash"". I hope they are well-prepared and manage to stay warm enough.While having lunch at the ""Pitstop"", I spoke with a local gentleman about the incoming storm. He told me it will be much worse in the mountains than down here in the ""holler"". While paying for my meal, I asked the lady for change for the laundromat down the street. She asked me if I needed any ""washing powders"" too. And then stated, ""Let me just go ahead an put that in a sack for you, so's it don't get spilt"". Right nice people here on the NC/TN border.

I met a south bounder (SOBO) last night at my campsite. His trip is almost over while mine has just begun. He told me I was wasting my time hanging my food bag in a tree each night; he had slept with his for the entire trip. He said something like, ""Out of all the folks hiking the trail, what are the odds that a bear is going to come after your food bag?"" I thought about it for a moment. I was tired and cold, and my sleeping bag was calling to me. Then, I went and hung my bag. I'd hazard a guess and say my odds of not being attacked are much greater than his.Tonight, I'm staying in a very nice lodge.

I stepped outside my room, took a couple of quick pictures with my phone and then walked out from under the roof line of the building onto the icy sidewalk. I immediately found myself flat on my back. My second fall for the trip, but this time no pack to protect me. It hurt, a lot but I'm okay.

While there, I met Chunky Monkey and Survivor, both fellow hikers. Chunky Monkey is also here on Trail Journals and his posts are humorous and interesting reading. Survivor is a cancer survivor from South Africa and although he says he feels great, he is having an issue and under the advice of his doctor, he is headed home today. I hate to see him go, he seems like a great guy and I'm sure I would have enjoyed hiking with him. But, this is just a hike!

Doug is planning to thru-hike when he retires in about 5 years. Doug has also been involved in scouting for years and has two sons who are Eagle Scouts. What a nice couple and the ride was certainly appreciated.Since I caught a ride so quickly, I was on the trail well before light and probably managed the first mile before the sun peeked over the mountains.

There were six of us in the shelter and, after a short discussion, we decided the wisest move was to follow the side trail that was still barely visible and come out of the mountains. We could have probably hunkered down in the shelter and rode out the storm, but we would have been miserable and each of us only had enough food to make it through the Smokies.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556538,"Back to the trail tomorrow!!! But, it was a close thing. Because so many folks came off the trail, I had to call four different shuttle services before I managed to find a ride tomorrow. I started calling at 9:00 this morning and rest did not have availability until Friday and even Saturday. It's still going to be on the cold side but the weather really appears to be improving over the next few days.Even though I know coming off the trail was the right decision for many reasons, I still feel guilty for my unplanned day of doing almost nothing. What did I do on my day off? I went to the outfitters and looked at all the items I would like to have if I had room and they weighed less. I ended up buying absolutely nothing. I also had a great breakfast and lunch, and once again cleaned all my equipment and did all my laundry. I also spent about an hour to find a few nearby geocaches.Another hiker off the trail told me today he didn't need to do laundry because he had done it a few days ago. I thought about that on and off all day. I, and most other hikers, have one pair of pants, one pair of shorts, two t-shirts, one set of thermal underwear, two pairs of socks and underwear, a puffy jacket, and rain gear. Some hikers carry even less. I always need to do laundry! I just haven't reached the ""embrace the stink stage yet"". Maybe the guy I met earlier is already there.Once I reach the trailhead tomorrow morning, I have a 4.7-mile hike just to get back to the AT. That's almost 10 miles of extra hiking added to my overall hike. I'm not sure why so many of us are willing, and even excited, to hike the 2,190.3 miles of the AT but hate, and even begrudgingly, take any additional steps.Oh, I've reached a couple of new personal landmarks. I've now hiked 181.5 miles of the AT (that's not counting the extra @#&$v€ nearly 10 miles due to the weather). That beats my previous personal landmark of 170.5 miles! I've also officially entered my third state when I passed into Tennessee. Until I reach Virginia, the trail will cross back and forth many times between TN and NC. For the next couple of weeks, I may not even know what state I'm in at any given time.No pretty picture for today, so I added a picture of a typical privy you might find on the trail. It could be worse...the last two shelters didn't have a privy at all. Take my word for it…when in the bathroom area (or anywhere else on the trail), an ""X"" is scratched into the dirt absolutely does not designate buried treasure...trust me on this one. Don't dig there!Tonight, I'm dry, warm, and safe in my hotel room. I expect to soon be having ""Happy Hiker"" dreams. Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Gatlinburg, TN

I caught a shuttle out of Gatlinburg this morning and was dropped off at the park at around 8:30. It was a 5-mile hike, all uphill to get back to where I left the AT and managed about another 9 after that. I was hoping to do 15 tomorrow but hiking in the snow is much harder than I thought it would be. On the other hand, I finally got to use those micro spikes I've been carrying the whole time.Tonight's low is supposed to drop down to around zero but I'm tucked down in my sleeping bag hoping for the best.Tonight, I'm safe and dry and hopefully will be warm soon.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556800,"Sorry for the short post yesterday. I wanted to type more but was literally shivering. I just wanted to bury down in my sleeping bag and try to get warm.Today was a tough day. We started with overcast and rain but the rain quit at about noon. The sun came out for about an hour around two and it got really nice for just a little bit.I believe I did about 13.5 miles today, not counting the half mile this shelter is off the trail. I had originally planned to stay at the shelter before this one but I felt good and decided to press on. I was able to get over to Clingman's Dome today instead of tomorrow. But it hurt, a lot.In an earlier post, I mentioned a young lady (Rebecca, now known as the “Beast”) from Switzerland who had carried another girl's Parmesan cheese from a Hiker's Box, just to reunite it with the original owner at a shelter. I met back up with her and her two friends last night at a shelter. At about 6:30 this evening they caught up to and passed me on the trail. By this time, I was really dragging and realized I bit off more than I was ready for and just wanted to get to camp. They asked if I was okay and when I told them yes, they continued on. I was surprised to find Rebecca standing on the side of the trail waiting for me. She was worried about me. What a sweet young lady. But, she is not the exception, everyone I've met has been wonderful.I used my micro spikes yesterday and today. At first I found them to be inefficient and painful but after I removed them and turned them ""spikes down"", they were much better. Just kidding, but I am sure glad I continued to carry these. Tomorrow is supposed to be the big thaw but I'm sure I'll need them then too.The weather so far has been rough--thunderstorms, hail, winds, and a winter snow storm. But these are the things we will laugh and talk about in the years to come. They are what make this an adventure and not just a walk-in the woods.I'm over Clingman's Dome! The highest spot on the entire trail and I’m over 200 miles...Less than 2000 left to go! I can't wait for the rest!Again, I want to say ""Thank you"" for all the emails wishing me luck and for all the advice. I can't even begin to tell you how important it is for my morale. One of you also asked me to post these myself instead of first sending them to my wife. I can't, even tonight, because I have no service. I can't log into Trail Journals but I can email it and sometime tomorrow, when I get service for just that one minute, it will send. Then she can post if from home.Tonight, I'm in a shelter, I'm safe, I'm dry, and in a little bit, I'll be warm. Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Derrick Knob Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556847,"It rained hard all night last night but I was in a shelter and it didn't bother me at all. As a matter of fact, it might have been the best night sleep I've had on the trail so far. The rain on the tin roof drowned out all the noises from the other hikers in the shelter--no creaking air mattresses, no sleeping bag zippers, and no snoring!I woke up at 5:30 am but the rain was still coming down hard. So, I rolled over and slept tell 7:30. I'd like to say the ""trail beckoned"" but actually ""nature called"" is probably closer to the truth.My shoes and socks were still wet from yesterday but it wouldn't have mattered. The trail was literally awash from the rain and melting snow. In some places, I'm sure it was at least four inches deep and flowing like a river. I felt like a salmon swimming upstream. By 11:00, the rain had ended and the sun started to peek through the clouds. For about two hours it warmed enough to strip down to my t-shirt. But by 2:00, the clouds were back and it started to sleet and rain. The rest of the day jumped back and forth between sunshine and clouds but it never warmed back up.Tonight, I'm bedded down at the Icewater Spring Shelter, only about half the distance I wanted to go today. But, my feet have been wet for two days and were beginning to get sore. I think stopping early and giving my feet a chance to dry will do me better in the long run. Now, I just have to watch my food supply. I might go hungry for a day before I can resupply at Standing Bear. About 1/10 of a mile from the shelter, I slipped and fell. After days of walking on snow and ice, I tripped over a root. I face-planted right in the middle of the trail in about 3 inches of water. Luckily, I wasn't hurt, but I couldn't wait to get to the shelter and into my dry night clothes. Remember, everyone on the trail thinks they are an expert hiker (even me), so take all the advice with a grain of salt. Figure out what works best for you and then modify it as conditions change. But three things I have learned: 1. Start out cold/cool when you go to bed at night. If you put on enough to be warm when you first crawl in, as your bed heats up, you might begin to perspire. As the temperature continues to drop, the sweat will get cold and your night can become miserable. Instead of wearing your coat to bed, have it nearby, you can always put it on later, if needed. 2. Start your hike cold in the mornings. You will warm up quickly as you hike. Otherwise, you find yourself stopping and removing clothing within the first half mile. This usually means removing and then donning your pack. 3. Try to pick clothing you can easily ventilate. Some jackets have armpit zips, they work great. I wear a buff (a tube of cloth) that can be worn in many different ways. Get one, they're fantastic. I start out with it covering my neck, head, and my lower face. As I warm up, I pull it from my face and then off my head, and finally just stuff it in my pocket. Gloves come off and on as needed. The trick is to try not to perspire.I've been told by a trail runner (basically a person paid to walk a section of the trail and monitor conditions) that by this point, almost 50% of the hikers who started in Georgia have quit. So far, for me, the hardest six inches of the journey have been the six inches between my ears. I just have to keep telling myself I can do this...and I can.Tonight, I'm safe, dry and warm, and living out a dream! Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Mt Collins Shelter

On the plus side, it had gotten cold enough to freeze the water on the trail so at least I didn't have to trek through 4 inches of water. My feet stayed pretty dry all day. I do have to say, thank God for micro spikes! Some of the trail is very narrow with major drops, add ice, and it gets pretty scary.Every tree, every leaf was covered with at least a 1/4 inch of ice. It was absolutely beautiful. And when the sun finally broke through the clouds around noon, it was spectacular!Most of the people I've met in the Smokies are trying to pass through as quickly as possible and I must admit, the weather has been challenging, but I'm really enjoying it. In my humble opinion, I would recommend everyone spend a week hiking through the Smokies. And, if you're very lucky, it might snow while you're there.Tonight, I'm sheltering at Tri-Corner Shelter. I know I said I didn't want to stay in the shelters, but in the Smokies it's mandatory unless the shelter is full. I still prefer my tent but these shelters are pretty nice. They were built by the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) in the thirties and have served more than 80 years of hikers. Tomorrow, I will hike downhill most of the day. There are a couple of little ups, but by the end of the day I will have descended by about 4,000 ft.

I don't remember what the book was about, but the title was ""A Door into Summer"". My hike today felt kind of like that. I started my hike cold in my puffy jacket, my long-sleeve shirt, and my t-shirt; and ended the day in just my t-shirt. The temperature went from around freezing to 61 degrees. The grass on the trail and the leaves on the rhododendrons turned green again. I even walked through a spider web. It was extremely nice.Tomorrow, I leave the Smokies. I'm actually just 9/10 of a mile inside the park now, at Davenport Gap Shelter. I'm going to miss them but I am excited about what's ahead. Tomorrow, I'm going to do a ""Nero"" of about four miles and stay at Standing Bear Hostel. I mailed a resupply there I need to pick up and it is certainly time for laundry and a shower.I broke my other shoulder strap buckle today just before reaching the shelter. I bought an extra buckle awhile back, but couldn't find it in my pack. I've got it rigged the way I did before. It should be fine until I can remove everything from my pack and find the replacement, or get another one.Never trust a SOBO. For that matter, never trust a NOBO or a section hiker.

While here, I got to shower, do my laundry, eat a pizza, and drink a Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer. The PBR was absolutely no better than I remembered it to be.For about $20, I get to sleep in a bunk room with about 15 others, take a scalding hot, to suddenly bone numbing cold, and then back to scalding hot shower, and scrub my filthy clothes on an old-fashioned wash board. (Soap is 50 cents extra). Believe it or not, it was all great!As I came out of the Smokies this morning, I came to one little last hill. Just as I crested it, my sense of sight was assaulted by a high-voltage power line, and the noise of rushing traffic on the interstate bludgeoned my ears. The sudden change from the serenity I had enjoyed in the Smokies was almost overpowering. And then, just as suddenly, I dropped back into a little hollow where a rushing stream and beautiful little waterfalls blocked out the brash sounds of civilization. I knew the sights and sounds of rushing traffic would return in just a few steps, but this final reprieve is just what I needed to make the mental adjustment.My picture today is a picture of something I saw on the trail just about a mile short of my destination.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557374,"I left Standing Bear Hostel this morning at about 7:30am and ended the day 15.2 miles later at Roaring Fork Shelter. It was a long but exciting day of hiking and I managed to only get lost twice. Overall, the trail is very well marked, but every now and then, it can be confusing. My first mistake this morning was caused by me not watching where I was headed and I took a left at a Y when I should have turned right. I caught the mistake within a couple of hundred yards and it only cost me a few minutes. The second time was near the end of the day. The AT made a hard left and the blazes were hidden by leaves. I continued down the trail I was on for about a half-mile before I realized something was wrong. When I finally reach this shelter, all three of the people here told me they had done the same thing. About an hour after I had arrived, another hiker who had passed me earlier in the day arrived. He told us he had continued down the wrong trail for more than two miles before finally turning back. Those extra miles don't count.I stopped for lunch today on a hillside in the sunshine just after 12:00.   After eating, just as I was restarting to hike, a young man came up the trail and asked me, ""Can I pass you? I don't want to be slowed down"". Now, I know I'm a lot older than most of the young people hiking the trail but I'm not dead yet, and his comment kind of struck me the wrong way. But, I let him pass and he went on over the crest of the hill.I finished tightening and tucking straps and continued my hike. As I crested the hill, I saw the young man about 75 yards in front of me and thought ""he's really not moving that quickly, I'm headed downhill, I bet I can pass him.""I took off after the guy hoping to catch up before he noticed me. But, when I was about 50 feet behind him, he glanced back and saw me. The look of shock on his face was priceless when he saw he was about to be overtaken by an old man and he started to speed down the hill. Well, I may be old but I also must have outweighed the kid by at least 50 lbs--going downhill I had gravity on my side. With each step, I gained a few inches. The young man kept glancing back and I could see the panic begin to grow in his face. I was like the Grimm Reaper, relentless in my pursuit. The sound of my feet striking the ground behind him ever nearer, ever louder, like Poe's “Tell-Tale Heart”.In front of us was another small hill, my weakness. I had to pass him soon or it would never happen. And then I saw it. His shoulders slumped! He stepped off the side of the trail and I passed him. The look of defeat, despair, even respect, was visible on his face as I passed by. I made it about half way up the hill before I stepped off to the side. As he got near me I said to him ""Go ahead son, I'm going to wait here for someone.""I managed to remain upright until he passed over the crest of the hill. And then, even laying on the side of the trail, my lungs heaving, retching, victory was sweet! Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry in my tent.

The weather was perfect, just cold enough that my 15° sleeping bag was neither too hot or too cold. I woke at 6:30, tore down camp, and quickly hiked the three miles into Hot Springs. From about a mile up, the trail (probably less than half that as a crow flies), I could hear the dogs in town barking and it might have just been my imagination, but I think I caught the aroma of fresh hot coffee and the tantalizing scent of bacon and eggs sizzling in the local diner.Upon entering town, my first stop was the diner. The breakfast skillet met all my expectations and more. As I entered the diner, I met three of the young folks I've been hiking with the last few days. They might be able to hike faster than me, but once it came to consuming mass quantities of food, they didn't stand a chance.I finished breakfast, said goodbye to my hiking friends and made my way down the main Street to the Iron Horse Station Hotel and managed to check into the room my wife had reserved for us. I dumped my dirty clothes and my trash, hopped in the shower and just managed to clean up before my wife arrived. The rest of the day has been a happy blur.

It's going to be hard to leave again but we plan to meet up once a month though. I did purchase my resupply for my next leg of my journey and cleaned and repacked my gear. I also purchased an inflatable pillow. I've been using my clothing bag but it just wasn't quite enough when I would lay on my side.One of you asked about my ""Spot"" locator. I consider it an essential piece of equipment. Since it works off satellite, I don't need to worry about signal loss. Every evening, with just a push of a button, I can let my entire family know my location, I've reached my campsite, and am safe for the night. I'm only using the basic service. When I turn on the tracking button (which I do every day), it sends a location signal every 12 minutes to my personal page. You can elect to purchase a higher level plan if you choose but the basic service does all I need. This does not send an email to my family but they can sign in and see my last location at any time.. The device also has an SOS button, basically 911, I can activate if I or someone else is injured. There are two other buttons you can customize to send a message to whomever you choose. I've got one of these buttons programed to ask my wife to pick me up at the given coordinates and the other buttons tells her I pressed the 911 button for someone else instead of me (she gets notified if I press the 911 button and I didn't want her overly concerned if it wasn't me that was hurt).The device costs $149 but you can almost always find it at half price (check REIs webpage or Amazon). To activate the unit, you sign an annual contract. You can pay monthly or save a bit by paying for the entire year up front. I paid for the year and it cost me $149.00. My only concern is the automatic renewal of the service. You must provide at least one month’s notice of cancellation and the unit number located in the battery compartment. This must be done in writing (I believe an email is sufficient) or they will bill your credit card for the next year. I recommend you keep the cancellation information in a safe location at home just in case the unit is lost. In the morning, my wife flies back to Texas and I head back out on the trail.

My wife is flying home and I won't see her again for another month. It rained, was foggy, and the wind was blowing most of the morning. To me, it seems strange to have all three conditions at the same time. I would think the wind would blow the fog away or the rain would knock it down. By 11:00, the weather was starting to clear and I couldn't tell if it was still raining or if it was just dripping from the trees but by noon the sun was shining and the day became very nice. Now, at 6pm the clouds and wind are back and it looks like it might begin to rain again at any moment. Because of the forecast for tonight, and because I still felt ready to press on at the last shelter, I'm staying the night at Hemlock Hollow Inn making my total for today approximately 16.3 miles. After being damp all day, a hot shower will certainly feel nice too.I met a young lady on the trail today named Sara. She told me she had left home when she was 17 and has been hitch hiking and hopping trains for the past 5 years. I've met several people on or near the trail that I've suspected of being homeless but this is the first to confirm it. She seems healthy and happy enough, but as a father to four girls, I can't help but worry some. She was also quick to accept, and eat, a bag of mixed nuts, a granola bar, and a chocolate bar when I offered them to her.I'm not sure when I entered it but I'm currently hiking in Cherokee National Forest. So far, it looks about the same as the Smokies. I sent my micro spikes home with my wife (1 lb gone!!!). So, I'm hoping no repeats of the ice and snow.Tonight, I'm safe, dry, and warm.

I have a choice tomorrow to do 14.9 and camp at a primitive campsite; or continue a little further and do around 18.5 and camp near a shelter.Since I primarily tent camp, the only real difference between the two is the shelter site has a privy and bear cables to hang my food bag. I have to admit, a privy is still much better than a cat hole, but not by much.   I'm not concerned about the bear cables because I have a line and can create my own.Even though it slowed me down a little this morning, I still think the hostel last night was a good call. After settling in, it rained for about two hours straight. It was nice to start the day with dry clothing and equipment. I stayed at Hemlock Hollow Inn. It was a little off the trail but it was the nicest hostel (by far) that I have stayed in so far. The couple that owns it even invited me to dinner. I was tired and declined their offer but it was very nice of them to offer. If you're hiking the trail, I highly recommend a stop here.Today, I went over the 300-mile mark. I still have a long, long way to go but like seeing the double 0s. I think breaking the trip down into more obtainable goals, such as a hundred miles, or distances to trail towns/state borders, helps me.Sometimes on the trail, you can see for hundreds of feet. Other times, the brush is so thick you feel like you're walking through a tunnel and can only see a few feet to either side. Today, while in one of the really thick areas, I heard something crashing through the brush. About 30 feet later, I came to an area where the visibility was better and about 100 yards down the trail, on the left side, I saw it. It was just sitting there, apparently waiting for me to come out. I stopped and watched it for more than a minute and it never moved. I took a step forward, hoping it would back off, but again it seemed unfazed by my actions. I hollered at it, nothing. I moved a step or two to the left and the same to the right. Again, nothing. A few more slow, cautious steps forward and then I knew! I had just seen my first bear stump! I'm sure I will see plenty more throughout my hike.

I know it's only been 4 days since Hot Springs, but after the rain and mud, I'm ready to clean up.I did get to the campsite early enough tonight to string a line between some trees and hang my sleeping bag and other items in the sun to air for a while. Even though nothing had actually gotten wet in the rain, everything felt slightly damp. As I lay in my sleeping bag writing this tonight, everything feels better (smells better too).Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry in my tent. Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Low Gap Campsite

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558188,"Got up this morning to another beautiful day. Beaker and I did a very quick 6.2-mile hike down the mountain and reached Uncle Johnny's Hostel just after 10 am. This gave us just enough time to check in and grab a shower before catching the shuttle to town for AYCE pizza and some resupply at the local Dollar Store. I didn't need much because my wife sent a resupply to the hostel but I did pick up some chocolate bars and Pop Tarts (I had plenty of instant oatmeal but I’ve had all I can eat for at least a little while.)After returning from lunch, we got in line to do our laundry, one washer and one dryer, only to learn the dryer was barely heating. Beaker (God bless him), an avid bicycle enthusiast, volunteered to take a loaner bike and take our clothes to the local coin laundry. No doubt, it got done much faster than if we had waited.While he was gone, I went through my resupply and hand washed a pair of socks I had inadvertently left out of my laundry bag. Gotta have everything clean before heading out again.This evening, we caught the shuttle ride again back into town for Mexican food and a trip to Walmart. I bought some replacement batteries for my SPOT (I don't need them yet but wanted to be prepared) and Beaker finished his resupply.Tonight is supposed to be a night of severe thunderstorms with high wind advisories, a good night to be inside. Unfortunately, the storms are supposed to continue until around noon tomorrow. We're going to play it by ear. If it looks okay in the morning, we'll head out. If not, we'll catch the shuttle to breakfast and then head out as soon as it appears safe.But tonight, everything I have is clean and dry, I'm safe, warm, and filled with a good dinner.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558408,"Woke up this morning at Uncle Johnny's Hostel to rain. But, the forecast said it would be over by noon and it already looked to be slowing down. Beaker and I decided to hike and by the time we hit the trail at around 7:55, the rain had stopped. Unfortunately, it started again around 9:00 and continued most of the morning. It was never really rained hard but it lasted long enough to soak me to the skin. After lunch, the sun broke through the clouds several times for a few minutes but never long enough to totally dry me out. By the time we reached our campsite at Cherry Gap Shelter, the wind had come up, it had cooled off even more, and I was shivering.I set my tent up as quickly as possible, climbed in, and changed into dry clothes. Feeling a little better, I went over to the shelter and prepared some Mountain House Lasagna and hot instant coffee for dinner. This helped a lot, but I still haven't totally warmed up. I just crawled into my sleeping bag so I suspect it won't be long until I'm nice and toasty.Hiking with Beaker the last few days has been a real pleasure. As I said in a previous post, I really like the young people but it's nice to have someone I can relate too. He also has a great hiking pace. As a 30-year military retiree, you would think I could maintain a pace when hiking, it's not that different than marching. But I can't. I'm constantly either finding myself just moseying along or exhausting myself trying to speed back up. Beaker's pace is consistent and just a little bit faster than mine. I must work to keep up but feel like I'm already improving. Having someone interesting to talk with, certainly makes the day go by quicker.I covered 17.1 miles today, much/most of it uphill. We plan to do about the same tomorrow. Right now, we are tentatively planning to stay at Roan High Knob Shelter tomorrow night. At 6,193 feet, it is the highest shelter on the entire trail. The temperature tomorrow night in the lowlands is supposed to be around 39 degrees. When you take away 3-5 degrees for every 1,000 ft., we might be looking at around 20 degrees tomorrow night. If the wind is blowing there, like it is here tonight, it could be much colder. We'll have to play it by ear and decide as we go.Tonight, the wind is howling, it has started to rain again, and it is cold outside; but I'm safe, dry, and almost warm in my tent.

My clothes were still damp from the day before so for much of the day I was slightly cold. I had some trouble keeping up with Beaker in the morning. I just couldn't seem to get the ole muscles moving smoothly but by afternoon things finally loosened up and I did much better. But, I was sure glad to see the shelter at the end of the day.We managed a little bit of trail magic twice today. We first met up with Rooster, Hydrator, and Hydrator's Better Half. We've met on the trail before (very nice people). They're slack packing to the south to pick up an area they had skipped over. We had a nice conversation and they shared their sandwiches with us! Then, at a road crossing, someone had left a bag of goodies and some cold soda. Beaker and I both had a bag of chips and a soft drink before moving on (thank you very much!).The sun finally peaked out at about 2:30 and by 4:00 there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Tomorrow is supposed to be beautiful.Tomorrow night we plan to stop at Mountain Harbour Hostel. We will probably end up doing an unscheduled zero there on Monday. I lost my wallet today on the trail. Lucky for me, a hiker named Ringer, who I met last night found it, picked it up, found my wife's phone number in it, contacted her, and is going to meet me to return it on Monday. She really has saved my entire hike and I can't thank her enough! But tonight, I'm safe, dry, and warm at the top of Roan Mountain, in the highest shelter on the Appalachian Trail.

This place has a reputation for being one of the nicest hostels along the trail and so far, I agree. We got here after a 16.4 miles hiking day through the Roan Highlands area. The day was beautiful, made even more so, after the last few days of rain. We spent much of the day hiking over balds where we could actually see more than a mile up the trail at times. I'm sure I'll remember this area as some of the most spectacular areas of the entire hike.We also left North Carolina for the last time today and will be in Tennessee until we reach Virginia in about 72 more miles. Honestly, for much of the last 100 miles or so, I usually didn't know if I was in NC or TN.A few days ago, I lost my wallet on the trail.   I didn't even know it was gone until my wife called me and told me that another hiker had found it. Luckily for me, I carry a card in my wallet that says ""In case of an emergency call...and my wife's phone number"". Ringer, the hiker who found my wallet, is currently about a day behind us. She, and I can't thank her enough, is going to meet us here at the hostel tomorrow evening with my wallet. I plan to do a zero here, so everything is working out perfectly so far.   The local news is also calling for heavy rains tomorrow with as much as 1-2 inches of rain possible. All of this makes it the perfect time to be taking a zero. I just hope Ringer and the other hikers remain safe.I also want to thank my wonderful wife for setting us up here. Without my wallet, money, and credit card, I don't know what I would have done without her. Because of her, tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry.

But after the first climb, the rest of the day went pretty well until the last little 500-foot climb at the end. By that time, I was exhausted and ready for dinner and my tent. But, we did 18.4 miles today. I believe that is a new record for me...And we passed the 400-mile point!

He is only hiking for 6 weeks and plans to leave the trail at Damascus. He continued to hike with us today and is sharing our room at the hostel tonight. Bo is an anthropology professor at a university and is very interesting to talk with. We spent much of today talking about the places we have been and the different cultures we have encountered. He also has a student (a previous thru-hiker) who is doing her thesis on the Appalachian Trail hiker culture. I bet it will be an interesting paper.I also pulled off the trail today to visit Bob Peoples at the Kincora Hiking Hostel. I would have liked to have stayed there but it was only noon and way too early to stop. Bob is a trail legend, both for his hostel, and due to his hard work in trail maintenance. He is also an Air Force veteran and my trip wouldn't have been complete without meeting him. We spent about a half hour together talking about the trail and about our military careers. The trail today was beautiful and we completed about 14.9 miles but there was a 2,000-foot climb (and drop) near the end of the day and for some reason, it hurt more than the 18+ miles we did yesterday.Due to bear activity on the trail, a 10-mile section has been closed to camping for the season. We had three choices:   hike 24 miles, hike about 10 miles, or hike the 14.5 we did and spend the night at ""Boots Off Hostel"". We chose the hostel. Darn, clean clothes and a shower only two days apart, and a free ride to McDonald's for dinner, omelets in the morning?

Flowers are also popping up all over and the wild violets are thick in some areas. I have not seen any rhododendrons yet but in the lower elevations, the buds are huge and should be starting to bloom soon.The same individual also asked about wildlife. Unfortunately, up to now I haven't seen much. I did almost step on a skunk one day, but even then, it ignored me completely, never raised its tail, and scampered on its way. I have also seen about a dozen white-tail deer (to include three yesterday and three more today), two turkeys, two woodchucks, and bunches of squirrels and chipmunks. And of course, mice in and around the shelters. I've heard grouse during the day, but haven't seen one, and owls and coyotes at night.I have yet to see a bear, or anything I can definitely call bear sign, but I did talk with a guy a couple of days ago who had met one on the trail the same day.

It was so nice, I had to take a break and cool my feet with several other hikers. The water is still too cold for anything but feet, and even they could only be submerged for a few minutes without going numb and turning blue. It's hard to believe that less than two weeks ago I woke to two inches of snow and frozen boots.I took a break for lunch today at Jenkins Shelter. A local lady had hiked three miles just to drop off a basket of Easter eggs filled with candy--candy for people she had never met. Every day the trail renews my faith in my fellow human beings. The day remained clear until I reached my last mile and then it began to sprinkle. By the time I crossed the stream near the road, it was raining hard enough that I hid under the bridge to get out of the rain. My campsite was right across the road in the woods but honestly, I don't like camping near a road and I don't like sitting up in the rain. Once the rain had almost stopped, I went to check out the campsite. Mostly mud and none too level…and more rain looked likely. The next shelter was 10 miles further up the trail and I'm not sure I had another 10 miles left in me. As I stood there pondering the situation it occurred to me that several vehicles had passed on the gravel road. I realized that instead of a nuisance, one of them might be a blessing. I went back to the road, stuck out my thumb and was picked up by the 5th vehicle to pass. About 15 minutes later, I was at the DQ in Bland, VA, enjoying a cheeseburger and a chocolate shake. Just a little later, I went across the street and checked into the Big Walker Hotel. I was even able to arrange a ride back out to the trail head at 7 am tomorrow morning.I've showered, washed my clothes, and enjoyed some town food. Now I'm ready for a good night's sleep.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560630,"I started my hiking day very early this morning. I had to meet my ride in front of the motel at 5:30 and was at the trail head before 6:00. This was the first morning I actually started hiking while it was still dark outside. It was also my longest hiking day at 22.1 miles!The weather was nice up until about 11 am and then it started to rain. I almost quit hiking several times during the day but on the occasions where the rain slowed down enough to set up my tent, there was no good camping sites. I finally found a suitable spot off the side of the trail at around 6:30. This is the first night of this trip where I'm camping totally alone. I only saw three other people all day. Two of them were thru-hikers I met in the past and one was a guy jogging. Usually I see 15 or more people throughout the day. I'm not sure where everyone is, but maybe they're holed up somewhere because of the rain. The young folks I hiked around the last couple of weeks had decided to do about 25 miles each day until Pearisburg. I'd rather go a little slower than that.Less people on the trail also means more animal sightings. I saw deer at three different locations today with at least three deer in each group. I also saw more squirrels and chipmunks than I usually do and although I never saw them, I heard turkeys several times today.Although everything else is wet, the inside of my tent is dry and warm. I'm safe and looking forward to a dryer, more pleasant day tomorrow. Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Laurel Creek

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560956,"I ended the day with an incredible meal at Woods Hole Hostel. Mike and Neville are fantastic hosts. They are into sustainable living and produce much of, or procure locally, most of the food they serve. Woods Hole is also often referred to as the oldest hostel on the trail and was first operated by Neville's grandparents. The home and bunkhouse are both over 100 years old. I consider this another must stay if you are hiking the trail. In my opinion, ""hiking"" the trail is only part of the whole experience. Staying at the hostels and visiting the towns along the way allows you to get to know the other hikers better, meet the locals, and give a little back to the local economy.During my hike today, and here at the shelter, I got to see some folks I hadn't seen in days, even weeks, and I even caught up to two of my favorites, Sitting Bull and Bri. I've been hiking around both of them for several weeks now. I like them immensely and I start to worry about them if I haven't seen them in a while (I'm just a dad and can't help it). I was afraid I had fallen too far behind to catch up but was pleased as I could be when I found them here this evening. Both of them are under 21 but have excelled where many others have quit. Both have an excellent attitude every day. Both intend on becoming engineers and I have no doubt they will be very successful. I can't help but smile every time I see them.Tomorrow, I head into Pearisburg. I need to resupply and would like to take a zero but haven't decided for sure yet and may just press on for a few more days. My feet are sore right now due to the rocks on the trail but I have been told that the worst is over, at least for a while.But, tonight I'm safe, warm, and dry and about to go to sleep inside a beautiful 140-year-old log cabin.

It looked like it would rain at any moment but at about 11 the sun broke through the clouds for about an hour and then the clouds returned. The rain held off until just before we reached Laurel Creek Shelter.Our original plan was to continue on for a few more miles and then find a campsite. But with the rain, thunder, and lightning, we decided that stopping at the shelter might be a better idea. Of course, as soon as we settled in and finished dinner, the sun was out again. But, now just before dark, thunder is rolling off in the distance again. I guess we will know tomorrow if we should have stayed or gone on. That makes my total miles for today only 14.6. But, that's okay. I didn't get soaked today.Itchy Feet and I covered miles of forest destroyed by Gypsy Moths today. One shelter was closed for fear of falling trees.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561426,"For the third day in a row, it rained. It rained most of last night and continued through most of the day. The picture for today is from one of the rare moments when the rain stopped. Seven of us who had stayed at the shelter were basically hiking together in a loose group today. The trail was very rock covered and in an area called ""The Ledges"" and both were very steep and very slick. Itchy Feet has been having trouble with her knees and Beetle appears to have pulled a muscle in her thigh. We were planning a 22.5 mile day, but with the rain and the injuries, at a road crossing near the 15-mile mark we decided to call Four Pines Hostel and get shuttled in. Friendly Ghost was actually carrying both his and his wife's pack. Once I got to the road, I was able to drop my pack, hike back, and relieve him of the extra weight. It was only for about a half-mile or so but I know they appreciated the help.Initially, we were planning to ""Slack Pack"" (leave our regular packs at the hostel and only carry a small loaner pack with food and water, get dropped off where we were picked up today, and hike back to the hostel) but it is still raining, and is supposed to be worse tomorrow. The weather forecast is 100% chance of rain, up to 3 inches, flooding likely, with damaging wind and hail likely. Tomorrow's high is supposed to be 50°. Now, I usually don't mind hiking in the rain, but the Dragon's Tooth would have been tomorrow. It is considered hard and slightly dangerous when it is dry. It is supposed to be tough enough that rebar steps and holds have been installed in various locations. It is also supposed to be one of the highpoints to see in this area and I want to see it. Clinging to the side of a cliff in high wind and heavy rain and hail doesn't seem like the best way to see it. I also haven't zeroed in a while; tomorrow sounds like the right day to do one. We’ll probably slack pack on Monday instead.I'm still without a backup battery for my phone. My wife is visiting next weekend and will bring me my extra battery from the house. Tonight, I'm at the hostel so I'll get a full charge but will have to be conservative while hiking. I still want to use it to take pictures but will need to keep my posts short.Tonight, has been like a family reunion. It seems like just about everyone I've met since I've been on the trail is here. Most are here because of the weather, some have been here for several days. It will be interesting to see who comes and goes tomorrow.It also seems that everything has budded, leafed, or bloomed during the last three days. The mountains are starting to come alive. The dogwoods, wild cherries, apple trees, redbuds, etc., are all covered with blooms and wild flowers are popping up everywhere. The next few days should be spectacular, especially when the sun comes back out.Tonight, I'm sleeping on a bench in a barn. Outside, it is pouring rain and I can hear thunder in the distance.

I've taken a couple of neros in the past two weeks but this was my first zero in a while. It also rained all day again today, so that was another nice reason for a break.I think this is eighth day of rain in a row. I doubt if it was the only reason, but a hiker I've been hiking with for a while decided to quit today. She just wasn't ""feeling it"" anymore.Tomorrow is supposed to be the same as today but I can't do two zeros in a row. Tuesday is supposed to be slightly better (I hope it is because I should hit McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs then and I really would like nice views of each of them). Finally, on Wednesday, it is supposed to be sunny again.The picture for tonight is the ""Dragon Wagon"". It is owned by Four Pines and is very well known and recognized by hikers and the locals in the area. They use it to shuttle hikers back and forth on the trail and to the local restaurant. While at the restaurant last night, I heard a mother threaten to purchase the van for her daughter's first car. The young girl really seemed concerned that it might actually happen.Tomorrow, I'll leave my sleeping area in the barn, be hauled in the ""Dragon Wagon"" 15 miles south with four others, and slack pack our way over ""Dragon's Tooth"" back to this hostel.

In just a couple of more days, I'll be 1/3 of the way done!Last night it rained all night long. Several times it rained so hard, the noise on the metal roof woke me up and that was while sleeping with earbuds listening to my iPod. This morning, when I woke it was still raining but I felt like I had to hike. Flooding was a concern and several of the streams that were just a trickle a few days ago were now major hazards. Luckily, we didn't have to cross any but several hikers going the other direction had to turn back. At least three hikers crossed the stream near where we had come off the trail two days ago and said the water was up to their waists and the current almost overpowering. They said they shouldn't have attempted it, and that they wouldn't try it again. Hermit, The Friendly Ghost, Beetle, and I completed a 15-mile section that took us past the Audie Murphy Memorial and Dragon's Tooth. It also brought us back to the hostel. It rained almost the whole time and the area around Dragon's Tooth was very slippery. Visibility wasn't very good because of the rain and fog, we were soaked to the skin, and the temperature was only around 47° but overall it was an enjoyable hike. The picture for today was taken during one of the rare moments when it had ""almost"" quit raining. As you can tell from the photo, in just the last two or three days, everything has turned green.The hostel we're staying in raises chickens, guinea fowl, and ducks so there is always an abundance of fresh eggs. I purchased a pound of bacon and a loaf of bread this evening at the nearby convenience store and plan to make breakfast in the morning for The Friendly Ghost, Beetle, and myself before heading out. They are planning to camp right before MacAfee's Knob but I'm hoping to make a couple of extra miles. As has become the norm, rain is predicted tomorrow morning but it is supposed to clear by the afternoon and the rest of the week is should be nice.My wife is going to meet me Friday morning and I'm really looking forward to spending the weekend with her (and doing some slack packing). I'm also getting rid of some of my winter gear and exchanging my sleeping bag for a lighter one. Remember, ounces add up to pounds and pounds equal pain. And, it's time to replace my boots for trail runners (I might be able to drop a pound right there).

I took my time packing up and making breakfast (and wasting time) hoping the rain would stop before I headed out. But, by 10:30, I just couldn't wait any longer and headed out. I really wanted a nice day for McAfee Knob but had just about given up on the possibility. Even as I approached it, the rain came down harder and the fog begin to roll in. South bound day hikers on the trail were even telling me it wasn't worth the hike and to come back another day. But just as I arrived, the rain stopped and the fog begin to lift. Although, not perfect, it was much, much better than I thought it was going to be just a few minutes prior. I was the only person there at first but soon a very nice couple and their teenage son arrived and we took pictures for each other.As I left the knob, the clouds closed in again and it started to rain once more. But, just before the sun set, I saw a little bit of blue sky off in the distance and now that it's dark, I can see a few stars too. Hopefully, tomorrow is going to be beautiful! After all these days of rain, some sunshine would be wonderful.Like most hikers, I use trekking poles. I can't tell you how many times they have saved me from falling already and I consider them almost as important as the shoes I wear. But, they can all become a nuisance at times. A few days ago, I walked through a spider web. As I continued to hike, I reached up to wipe it off my face. Without noticing, my hiking pole was now raised to nose height, and sticking out straight in front of me. The trail made a slight bend and the other end of my pole struck a tree. Yes, I almost knocked myself out on the trail. Today, I did a similar thing trying to check the time on my watch. My recommendation, buy a good set of poles…just don't hurt yourself with them.I heard from Beaker today. It appears the move is going well. I'm hoping it won't be long before he is back out here hiking with me.Tomorrow...Tinker Cliffs! Hopefully, in the sunshine!

It was glorious!As I made my way towards Tinker Cliffs, the fog slowly rose up out of the valley and for just a bit I was concerned that the view would be obscured. But, by the time I had hiked the 5.5 miles from the shelter, the fog had completely disappeared and the view was incredible.Even after the cliffs, the rest of the hike was great. It was what I've always imagined a hiking day should be. The climbs weren't too bad and the trail was relatively free of rocks and roots.I reached Daleville at about 6 pm, checked into the ""Super 8"", showered, and then headed down to the Three Little Pigs Barbeque for some dinner. When I got there, I saw The Friendly Ghost and Better just getting ready to order. They invited me to sit with them and I had a great time visiting with them. My wife is coming for the weekend, I hope to do some slack packing but expect them to be at least a day ahead of me when I get back on the trail. They hike pretty quickly but we have often ended up at the same locations in the evening. They are a wonderful couple from Denmark and I hope I will eventually catch back up to them.I met a very likeable and funny young man a few days ago. His trail name is Bear Spray. He earned his name the day before he started his thru-hiker when he accidentally sprayed himself in the face, in his hotel room, with his bear spray. He said it was like mace x 10. He immediately ran into the bathroom and flooded his face with water until he could breathe again. Upon leaving the bathroom, he found that the whole second floor of the hotel had been evacuated. They eventually allowed everyone back in but had to replace (and charge him for) the mattress and bedding in his room. He is absolutely a trail legend for 2017.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562277,"I started out slowly this morning and didn't get out of the hotel until after 10 am. My wife is flying in tonight and I wanted to be back in town to meet her so I set up a slack pack day. My original plan was to be dropped off about 15 miles out and hike back to the hotel but my (Trail Angel) ride couldn't meet me until the afternoon. So I just reversed my plan, hiked out of town, got picked up at a crossroad 16.1 miles up the road and am now back at my hotel room. 
I know some people don't believe in slack packing but I'm a big proponent of HYOH (Hike your own hike) and have no problems with it at all. I don't blue blaze, aqua blaze, or yellow blaze but really don't have a problem with people doing any (or all) of them either, depending on the situation. For example, I recently met a woman hiking with her 6-year-old son. I believe Tinker Cliffs and the Dragon's Tooth areas to be too dangerous for someone that young. If the mother chose to blue blaze these areas using a safer route, I would respect that decision. 
For me, my wife is coming tonight. I haven't seen her in more than a month. I wanted to do some hiking today but still be back in time for her arrival. Slack packing seemed like my best bet. Another advantage to slack packing is it reduces wear and tear on my body. It gives me times to rest and heal without getting off the trail. I think it's a win/win for me.
Tomorrow, I get new shoes. I'm both excited and worried at the same time. For the past 740 miles, I've worn mid-height Oboz boots and haven't had any foot problems. With new shoes comes the possibility of blisters or other troubles. On the other hand, trail runners weigh less than half of what my boots weigh. I could drop nearly 2 lbs. I've been told, that a lb. on your feet is like 5 lbs. on your back. I'm not sure if that's true, but I want to find out.
I'm also getting rid of my 15-degree bag and replacing it with my 35-degree bag…another pound gone! I'm getting rid of my heavy liner (which adds up to 25 degrees), my heavy sleeping socks, my watch cap, my long sleeve shirt, my pant legs, my rain pants, and a few other small items. I'm also exchanging my slightly heavier, lined rain jacket with a lighter marmot jacket. Overall, I'm hoping to drop about 5 lbs. in pack weight. Next month, I'll exchange my 35-degree bag for a light down throw and save another pound.   As you know, every ounce adds up and pounds equal pain. I want to be comfortable at night but want to do it as lightly as possible.
My picture for today is a pretty Black Racer Snake I first saw beside the trail. I stopped to watch it and it slithered onto the trail, within just a few inches of my foot. For a moment, I thought it was even going to climb my leg. I'm not a snake expert, but these are easy to recognize. I knew it was harmless, so I wasn't concerned. After taking a couple of pictures, I decided to move on. As soon as I lifted my foot, it was obvious where the name ""Racer"" comes from. This guy could really move and in a flash, he was off the trail into the underbrush.

We started the day with breakfast at Cracker Barrel and then made a trip to two different outfitters to find me some replacement shoes. After that, we went out for ice cream, then back to the room to do laundry. Tonight, I took her to ""The Home Place"" for dinner. I'd eaten there while I was staying at the Four Pines Hostel and the owner of the outfitters recommended it for dinner. I was surprised to find that a place I’d walked away from for two days was only 12 miles away by road. Ah, life at two miles per hour and along the long and winding trail, is quite different than life with an automobile at 60 mph. While at the restaurant, I ran into Jam and Engine and Caboose. It was very nice to see them again and I really hope to get to see them again, and again, all the way to Katahdan. I also met another hiker today for the first time. He seemed like a great guy and I hope to meet him more too. He goes by ""Sarge"". With a name like that, he has got to be an incredible person!I decided on Oboz Trail Runners for my next pair of shoes. They felt great on my feet and I like the traction. I've been wearing Oboz mid-height boots and they have treated me well. I'm hoping my new shoes are just as good. They also weigh about half what my boots weigh. This time, I did not go with the water proof. I found my boots stayed dry longer than most people's did but took days to dry out. Lower shoes are apt to get wet inside easier anyway and drying faster will be a big plus. And, I'm sure it will be much better for my feet.

I contracted Lyme Disease during a hike a few years ago.   Luckily, I was bitten on the front of my thigh and,found the tick the day after my hike.  I developed the bullseye bruise almost immediately.   I was able to see a doctor the very next day and was given the proper antibiotics.   No other symptoms ever materialized and I'd rather not press my luck with catching it again.  My plan is to treat everything I can at least monthly.

My wife is going to drop me back on the trail tomorrow morning at about 6 am before heading to the airport.  Tomorrow is going to be a rough day.  Not only will I be missing her, but I'm also planning a 20-mile day.  I'll also be carrying 7 days worth of food and hope to make it all the way to Waynesboro before stopping again.  Even though I got rid of most of my cold weather gear, replaced my boots with trail runners, and changed to a lighter sleeping bag, I still expect a heavy pack due to all the food.

Today's weather also played a role.  I think the temperature stayed in the lower 70s all day.  There was light cloud cover most of the day and a light wind which kept it comfortable.  I hope tomorrow turns out nice too, but I know they are calling for rain the next few days.  Hopefully, it won't be a repeat of last week.

Once again, I'm in a shelter.  I know for a person who said he rather tent, I've sure spent a lot of nights in them but we've just had so much rain lately.  I just don't like packing away a wet tent.

I have another long climb in the morning but after that, it should be about 15 miles of (basically) downhill.  If the rain holds off or isn't too bad, I'd like to do another 20-mile day.  I think I made the right choice with my new shoes.  No hot spots today.  Let's see how they hold up.

On the other hand, my feet are really sore.  I believe it is from hiking most of last week in wet boots and then doing the same thing again yesterday.  I'll just have to wait and see how they are tomorrow.  At least tomorrow is a shorter hiking day for me, even if the first five miles is all uphill.  I'm only planning a 15-mile day.  After two 20s and an 18, “only” 15 will be a treat.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563269,"Another great hiking day today.  I think the high was 67 and it was sunny all day.  It was actually a little cool and windy at first when I started out, but felt great as soon as I warmed up a little. 
I only did a 15.8-mile hike today but much of it was up hill and my feet are still a little sore.  But, they seemed better today than yesterday and I hope they are even better tomorrow.  Tomorrow will be another (kind of) short day at around 14.9.

I heard from Beaker this morning.  He is going to meet me Monday in Waynesboro.  I expect to be there Sunday morning, so that will give me time to resupply, do my laundry, and relax for the rest of the day before meeting him the next morning.

Tonight, it is supposed to drop down to 40°.  I guess I'll find out if my 35° bag will be sufficient.  The rest of the week  is only supposed to be in the upper 30s at night.  I still have my down jacket and a light set of thermals but I might be sorry I sent my cold weather gear home so early.  I knew it was a risk but just the thought of getting rid of the extra weight made it too enticing to pass up.

There is a possibility of rain again tomorrow afternoon.  It wouldn't upset me at all if the weatherman was wrong this time and the storm missed us.

So far tonight, I'm safe, dry, and warm in my tent.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Brown Mountain Creek Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563271,"They were calling for rain for this afternoon but it wasn't supposed to begin until after 2 pm.  I thought if I started a little early, I could be at a shelter that was 14.8 miles away before it started.  My plan worked perfectly until I got to the shelter and realized I still had plenty of hiking day left and there was still no sign of the predicted rain. 
I decided to move on to the next shelter that was about 6 more miles up the trail…and I do mean up.  Over the first 4 miles, I climbed more than 3,000 feet over some of the most rock covered trails I have seen so far.  And, right at the top, the rain began to fall.  It rained so hard that for a while I couldn't see more than 50 feet in front of me.  As time went on and I worked myself down the side of the mountain, I convinced myself that I had somehow missed the shelter.  I eventually took some cover under a large leaning tree and verified my location on my phone app.  I still had .9 miles to go.  After another eternity of walking, I checked it again, sure once more that I had missed it.  This time it told me it was ""nearby"", meaning less than a tenth of a mile away.  In just a few more feet, I found the blue blaze trail and followed it to the shelter.

When I got here the shelter already had 6 people inside, its capacity.  But luckily for me, they were willing to squeeze together and make room for me.  I've now dried out, made my dinner, and slipped into my sleeping bag and the rain continues to pour down.  One of the others here tonight told me the forecast is for rain all night and thunderstorms tomorrow.  There's another shelter in 15 miles away or Waynesboro is about 20 miles away.  I'll have to see what tomorrow brings.

But tonight, I'm safe, warm, and reasonably dry in a very crowded shelter.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563297,"It rained all night last night and continued to rain throughout much of the day.  As you can see from the photo, much of the trail turned into a stream today and some of the streams are raging rivers.  Crossing a couple of them was a little scary…the water was up to our knees.  But at about 4 pm, I made it to my shelter for the evening.  Right before getting here, the sun broke through the clouds and the rest of the evening was beautiful.  Even though it's only about 5 miles into Waynesboro tomorrow morning, I'm hoping tomorrow is nice too.
I'm really looking forward to a shower, laundry, and some town food tomorrow--I'm in need of a Zero day too.  The rocks, climbs, and the rain really took its toll on me this week.  Up until today, I've only fallen five times during the entire hike.  Today, I went down 3 times, once hard.  I've bruised my right shoulder and elbow.  A day and a half of rest should go a long way towards healing my aches and pains; and drying out my shoes too.

I'm also really looking forward to joining up with Beaker and the Shenandoahs promise to be interesting.  I can hardly wait to try the blackberry shakes everyone keeps talking about.

Hopefully by tomorrow, most of the water on the trail will have drained away and the hiking will be dry and easy.  But now it's time to hit the rack.  I'm safe, warm, and dry.  I hope everyone enjoyed Cinco de Mayo!  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Mauphin Field Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563411,"The trail into Waynesboro this morning was still a running stream in many areas.  My shoes were already soaked from yesterday and even if they weren't, there was no way to keep them dry this morning, so I just slogged my way through.
It only took me about two hours to make it to the gap.  I felt it was went fast considering the condition of the trail.  At one point, I was literally ankle deep in mud for about 50 feet.

As I neared Rock Fish Gap, the wind began to how, rain begin to fall and the temperature must have plummeted at least 20 degrees.  I called Stanimal's 328 Hostel as soon as I reached the road but their drivers were out already picking up/dropping off other hikers.  I was considering calling one of the local Trail Angels when I saw “Pokemom” standing outside her car waving me over.  I hiked with her early on the trail but she had to pull off when she contacted a respiratory infection.  She emailed me yesterday and told me she was doing Trail Magic today at the gap but I thought it would be later this afternoon.  What a wonderful person.  Even though she was only on the trail for about 100 miles, everyone seems to know and like her.  She just brightens up the day every time she's around.  She offered me a ride to the hostel and I quickly accepted.  Sometimes, the best trail magic is a ride in a warm, dry vehicle.

I spent the rest of the day at the hostel just drying out, showering, and doing my laundry.  I didn't realize how badly I smelled until I picked up my dirty clothes after my shower.  Wearing the same clothes five days in a row is rough, but being soaked by the rain three out of five of those days is even worse.  Hopefully, my shoes will fully dry out before I meet Beaker and head into the Shenandoahs on Monday.

Tonight, I had dinner with a section hike at an AYCE Chinese Restaurant.  It was wonderful, but I'm stuffed.  Tomorrow, I'll resupply for the next leg of my adventure but only minimally.  I've been told there are chances to stop and eat at multiple locations in the park and I plan on taking advantage of all of them. 

Tonight, the temperature is supposed to drop into the mid-thirties.  In a few minutes, I'm going to go to sleep in a bed inside a hostel.   I'm safe, dry, and warm.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Paul C. Wolfe Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563562,"I spent a very relaxing day doing as little as possible.  But, that doesn't mean I didn't do anything.  I made a trip to the local outfitters.  I bought fuel for cooking and a package of three replacement squeeze bags for my water filter.  My Sawyer filter works great.  I love it.  It's light, simple to use, and easy to clean.  But unfortunately, the squeeze bags don't seem to last very long and I've already gone through three of them.  They are cheap and available at every outfitter I've been to.  Some people use a smart water bottle instead but I like the bags, even if I must replace one about every three weeks.

I also back-flushed my filter today and cleaned my other containers with a weak bleach solution.  And, even though I try to only use my pot for boiling water, I washed it and my spoon too.

While I was at the outfitters, I also purchased a couple of Mountain House dinners and two of the Granola Breakfasts.  Although they tend to be a little bit expensive, I think they are probably better for me than the instant mashed potatoes and Ramen most of the younger folks eat almost daily.  And, I like the variety and how lightweight they are.

I also made a trip to the local Kroger’s and finished my resupply.  Even though I expect to be in Shenandoah National Park for about the next 8 days, I'm only carrying 3 days of food. There are small stores and eateries throughout the park along the trail and I hope to get most of my meals from them as we pass by.

I'm currently staying at Stanimals 328 Hostel and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Adam and his wife Dana are incredibly nice.  The place is very clean, quiet, comfortable, and reasonably priced.  They will also pick you up and drop you off back at the trailhead.  Adam is also a past AT thru-hiker and has done about 1,000 miles of the PCT. 

About 3 blocks from the house, less than a 10-min walk, is the Kroger's, a Taco Bell, and a deli/pub named E&Js.  I had dinner there and had a burger they call the ""Hangover"".  It was possibly the best burger I've ever had.  They have a great selection of craft beer too.

If you ever hike this section of the trail, I highly recommend this hostel and restaurant.  I don't think you will be disappointed with either.

My picture tonight is of a sign I saw on the trail.  Most signs warn against motorized vehicles, pack animals, and bicycles.  This one added hang gliders to the list.  I just found it funny.  Were hang gliders along the ""long green tunnel"" becoming a nuisance at some point?

Tomorrow morning, I meet back up with Beaker and we will continue our journey north.  I'm really looking forward to the Shenandoahs and, even more so, to be hiking again with my hiking buddy.  But, that's tomorrow, tonight I'm spending another night in a warm bed, after another hot shower.  My clothes are clean and I'm safe, warm, and dry.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Stanimals 328 Hostel, Waynesboro, VA

He finally arrived at the trail head around 5 pm.  We had intended to start out at about 10 am to begin our hike, but 5 pm was what we got.  We had to make 7.7 miles to the nearest shelter before dark and we made it with minutes to spare.

He brought back his hammock instead of his tent (I'm jealous) and had no trouble finding a place to hang it, but all the tent sites were already taken.  Luckily, there was still room in the shelter. There's a freeze warning for tonight, and I think my tent is warmer, but that's where I'm at.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563902,"I had a great day hiking with Beaker today.  We managed a 19.1 day, not counting the 0.3 out of the shelter this morning, 0.4 in/out of another shelter, or the 0.6+ we did at the campground tonight.
Shenandoah National Park has been beautiful so far and the trail has been great.  We reached Loft Mountain Campground at about 5 pm, checked in, set up camp, and headed down to the camp store and showers.  We both managed to charge our phones while eating dinner and showering (the showers cost $1.75 for 5 minutes and we used our bandanas as towels).  So far, the only drawback about the place has been lack of cell service.
Beaker did a superb job on the trail today after taking a 3+ week break to move.  He was concerned he wouldn't be able to keep up but he wore me out.  I'm sure that in only a few more days I'm going to really be working hard just to keep up again.

When we returned to our campsite from the store and showers, we were surprised to find Ramsey Bolton at our campsite.  We've known Ramsey for a while now, but other than last night at the shelter, we hadn't seen him since Damascus.  He had told us last night that he was only going to do 13 miles today so we we're glad to see him.  I believe we're planning to stay at the same locations for at least the next 5 nights.
The weather tomorrow is supposed to be nice, but they are calling for rain to start again tomorrow night and up to 3 inches on Thursday.  We planned to camp in the campgrounds along the trail for the next few nights and use the camp stores and waysides for our meals.  But, we might need to modify our plans to try to avoid sleeping in the rain at night.  We'll just have to see what the next few days bring.  Either way, tomorrow we're planning on a shorter day and a night in a shelter tomorrow night.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564036,"Bear!  Bear!  Beaker and I saw our first bear today.  It was about 50 yards off the trail looking at us, when we saw it.  It watched us for about three seconds, just long enough for me to realize I wanted/needed to take a picture and, like a puff of smoke, then it was gone.

It was exciting for both of us and we high fived as soon as it was gone.  Although we both have a healthy respect for bears, neither Beaker nor I ever felt threatened by this animal.  We hope to see more under similar conditions and maybe, just maybe, get a picture or two.
We stayed in Loft Mountain Campground last night and had our dinner out of the camp store.  This morning, we hiked about a mile and a half then had our breakfast at a wayside in the park.  Waysides are small store/restaurants scattered throughout the park.  In this case, it was relatively close to the trail.  We only had to hike a half mile both directions to get a hot breakfast.  We were even able to talk them into making us sandwiches for our lunch.  The waysides in Shenandoah are famous for their blackberry milkshakes.  Of course, I had to have one with my bacon and eggs.  I'd recommend it!  I also plan to get one at every wayside we pass.
It has already started to rain.  They are currently calling for a half inch tonight, an inch tomorrow and another half inch tomorrow night and Friday.  It sucks, but still better than the three inches they were calling for tomorrow.
We called ahead and reserved a room at the lodge at Big Meadows Campground.  We will get out of the rain for the evening, have a nice dinner, breakfast, shower, and possibly do laundry.  AWOLs guide also states they have a ""Taproom"".  It sounds intriguing.

Tonight, we are staying in a lodge here in Shenandoah.  They have a restaurant that serves breakfast (and will pack us a lunch) but it doesn't open until 8:00.  For this 5-6-day leg of the journey, we only brought three days of food because we knew we could eat in these places instead.

We are planning a late start in the morning.  Tomorrow night, we will stay in a shelter due to the rain unless the shelter is already full.  With the late start, that's a real possibility.  If the shelter is full, the tent will have to do.

Even with the rain, it was an excellent hiking day.  We started our day with a hot breakfast at Big Meadows Lodge.  I had the omelet and the waffle.  Well, I split the waffle with Beaker, but it was still a lot of food.  We hiked about 9+ miles and had a rather leisurely lunch at Skyland Wayside Restaurant.  We followed that up with another 9+ miles to our shelter for the evening.  That makes a total of 18.8 miles today.  Eating at the restaurants are convenient, allows us to eat something different than our usual fare, and takes weight off our backs.  Tomorrow, we have one more wayside which we should hit around lunchtime (burger, fries and another blackberry milkshake for me, please).

We plan on hiking 22.4 miles tomorrow.  It will be my biggest hiking day yet. I hope I'm up to it--well, I must be.  Other than breakfast for tomorrow morning, I'm out of food.  We will be leaving Shenandoah National Park and staying in a hostel tomorrow night.  This will give us another chance to finish drying out, resupply for out two-day hike into Harper's Ferry, shower, and do some laundry.

Tonight, it's cold, it's raining, and someone in the shelter is snoring very loudly.  But, I have my iPod and I will crank up my music. I'm approximately 950 miles into my hike, my shoulder aches, my knees ache and my feet are sore, but I can't wait to see what tomorrow will bring.   I'm safe, dry, and starting to warm up in my sleeping bag.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Big Meadows Lodge

Again, it rained most of the day. I'm not sure if I've just gotten to point where I'm used to it or just knowing its the last day of rain for a while, but it didn't much bother me today.  Just as we reached our hostel for the evening, the sun finally broke through the clouds and by dark, the sky was totally clear. Tomorrow is supposed to be beautiful.

We caught the hostel shuttle into town, resupplied, ate dinner, and made it back to the hostel in time to do our laundry and take a shower.  We'll be heading out first thing in the morning. 

I know many people probably think we spend the evenings around the campfire telling ghost stories, making smores, and singing.  But, usually by the time you've set up your campsite and finished eating, you are so exhausted that you just want to go to bed.  Staying at a hostel is usually the same routine, but you also get to resupply and do your laundry too.  We call anything after dark ""Hiker's Midnight"" which translates into time for sleep.

It's hard for me to believe that in just three days, I will not only pass the 1,000-mile mark, but I will also be in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia.  It’s the symbolic half-way point on the trail and I'm really excited about it.

Tonight's picture is of Beaker crawling under a fallen tree on the trail.  Not a pretty sight...no, not at all.  We actually had to do this twice because we had made a wrong turn on the trail.  We also walked about a half-mile further than we needed to today.  When you are already hiking almost 2,200 miles, you don't want to walk any extra, unneeded steps or miles.

Once again, I want to say thank you for all the advice and well wishes.  You don't know how important it is to my hike.  Your comments are often the motivation I need to keep going every day and I really appreciate them.

Tonight, I'm at a brand-new shelter called Whiskey Hollow.  It is so new there is still building materials and scaffolding stacked at the side of the structure.  This shelter would easily hold 20 hikers but there's only four of us in it tonight.  What they don't have here are any tent sites.  Beaker managed to hang his hammock but if I set up my tent, it would probably be at a 10° angle and I would slide to the bottom or up against the side.  So, it's another night in a shelter for me.  I don't mind when they are as new and as empty as this one.

My picture tonight is some Lady Slipper Orchids I saw beside the trail.  It is only the second time I've seen them.  They're not very common.  Not long after taking the photo, we came across a group of day hiker, bird watcher, flower enjoyers.  They come out as a group every Mother's Day for the past five years.  They were very excited that I saw the orchids and wanted to know exactly where I’d seen them...”Ah, about a mile back on the left side of the trail” wasn't exactly the answer they were looking for.  They were also very excited to meet a couple of thru-hikers because none of them had ever met one before.  We talked with them and answered their questions for about 15 minutes before moving on.  Beaker and I are getting pretty good at this and we are perfecting our routine.  I like to think we're the Martin and Lewis of the trail (I'm Martin, he's Lewis).

Tomorrow, I hit 1,000 miles and we start on the ""Rollercoasters"".  It’s a 13.5-mile stretch of continuous “MUDS” (Mindless Ups and Downs) and ""PUDS"" (Pointless Ups and Downs).  We've been told they're tough, but we'll get through it.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564743,"It was an incredible day for hiking!  The weather was fantastic…not a cloud in the sky and a temperature of about 70°.  The birds were singing all around us and a nice, cool, gentle breeze blew most of the day.  The perfect day to hit the 1,000-mile mark and to start crossing the section known as the ""Rollercoasters"".

First, 1,000 miles!  I've always planned to hike the entire trail and I know it is approximately 2,200 miles long.  But, I don't think I fully understand, or appreciated, the distance involved until I was nearing this point.  1,000 miles!  It seems incredible to me that anyone could walk this far; even more so, that I have done it.  And, I'm ready to walk on!  Folks, if I can do this, so can you!  Just do it! 

Next, the ""Rollercoasters"".  The Rollercoasters are a series of quick ups and downs that run 13.5 miles.  They have been mentioned, often cursed, in every AT book I've read.  Beaker and I covered two-thirds of them today (the latter part of an 18-mile day).  The Appalachian Trail Conservatory owns the Bear's Den Hostel where we're staying tonight.  We will finish the coasters tomorrow morning.  These things are no joke.  I sweat through my clothes at least five times today and drank more than a gallon of water.  The climbs are steep but the worst part for me was the thousands of rocks of all sizes on the trail.  In my opinion, they make the trail much, much harder than it would be if it was smooth.

Tomorrow will be a 20-mile day.  We will end the day in Harper's Ferry where we plan to Nero the next day just long enough to resupply and check in at the ATC Headquarters.  We will head back out on the trail as quickly as we can afterwards and should be well into Maryland before the end of the day.

But, it's well past Hiker's Midnight, and I'm falling asleep as I type.  Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry.  I’m excited to be entering a new state tomorrow—my fifth so far.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter

We caught up to Sitting Bull and Bri (now known as Hoops) at the ATC HQ tonight.  They are staying at the same hostel as we are tonight and went to dinner with us.  It's been almost a month since I've seen them.  It is sure nice seeing them again.  Sitting Bull is suffering from shin splints and will be zeroing here tomorrow but Hoops will be moving forward.  He tends to hike faster than her and she has to leave the trail for a couple of days next week to prep for school, so they should reconnect after that.

We also ran into Squire and his two sons, Remix and Stretch. Squire is a retiring Marine pilot (currently on terminal leave).  Stretch is 14 and Remix is 12.  They are known to hike 25+ miles a day.  They are also two of the smartest, politest, best behaved, young men I've ever met.  Did I mention, they are also fluent in 4 languages?  I'm glad I got a chance to see them again too.  They only came back this far south to pick up an area they had skipped earlier.

Tonight, we are staying in a hostel here in Harper's Ferry but we will be heading out again in the morning.  We hope to do another 18 miles.  This section of West Virginia is only 4 miles so we will be in Maryland before the morning is over.  The trail in Maryland is 40 miles.  It should only take a couple of days to pass through and then on to Pennsylvania before the weekend. After spending more than a month in Virginia, hiking in 3 more states in less than a week seems almost surreal.

The hike today was just shy of 18 miles and the terrain wasn't too bad, but the temperature reached 91°.  It is supposed to gradually drop back down in the next few days (88 tomorrow, 82 on Friday, 75 on Saturday, and 69 on Sunday).  It's hard to believe that less than a week ago, we found a father and son shivering from the cold in their sleeping bags at 4 pm in a shelter.  These 30-40 degree swings in temperature are hard to adjust to.

Tonight, we are at a free campground that borders the trail.  A bathroom with a shower is available so it's pretty nice.  I'm tenting tonight but I really don't care if I sleep inside or outside, but I really like having a shower at the end of the day.  I also washed out the clothes I wore today.  Even if they're not totally dry in the morning, at least they will be clean (sorta, at least as clean as I could get them in the shower using hand soap).

Beaker received a message this morning that Trail Angel Vicky wanted to meet us on the trail at lunch time.  What an incredibly sweet person.  She brought us Italian subs that were delicious and homemade brownies.  She also brought fruit and ice cold soda (root beer and orange soda is currently my favorites, I'm not sure why, I've rarely drank them in the past).  If you are reading this Ms. Vicky, thank you so much.  The food was great, but the fact that you shared your time with us was even better.  It was so nice to meet you.

The picture tonight is a view of the Potomac River, not too far after the confluence with the Shenandoah River.  The C&O Canal runs right alongside the river and as we traveled along the tow path, it was fun to imagine mules pulling barges along the trail 100 years ago.

Tonight, after making my dinner, Ringer came walking into camp.  I haven't seen her in more than a month.  She is the young lady who found and returned my lost wallet.  I owe her big time.  She really saved my hike, or at least saved me from lots of troubles and delays.  I tried to give her a reward before and she refused to accept it...but she did accept a piece of chocolate tonight.  It's good to see her again and I'm glad she is still on the trail.

Hoops (aka Courtney or Bri), also came in just before dark.  I had just seen her a couple of days ago with Sitting Bull in Harper's Ferry but she had decided to stay until later in the day and we headed out early.  This put her in a shelter behind us but she decided to push a 26-mile day to catch up with us today.  Two things on that:  1.  26 miles!  Oh, to be that young again!  2.  I'm glad she caught up.  She can take care of herself, but I'm a father of 4 beautiful girls and she reminds me of them...I guess I just can't help being a dad.

I also ran into ""The Captain"" here at the shelter.  He is another great young man I hadn't seen for a while. Beaker and I had just been talking about him earlier today and wondering how he has been doing.  It's great to see him too.

It's funny, other than when we were at the AT HQ a couple of days ago, we hadn't seen a thru-hiker in more than a week and then we see three of our favorites in the same day.

Tonight's picture is of the beautiful Maryland sky, taken after eating lunch and laying on the picnic table at a shelter.

Tonight, I'm safe, warm (a little too warm but it will cool down), and dry.  Tomorrow, we will do brunch and then cross the Mason Dixon Line and enter our 7th state...Pennsylvania.  Exciting days are ahead of us.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Dahlgren Backpack Campground

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565326,"Today, we crossed the Mason Dixon Line.  We left Dixie and entered the northern State of Pennsylvania.  It was nice to enter my 7th state but I'd be remiss if I didn't admit that the hiker's nickname of “Rocksylvania” has me a little concerned.  Pennsylvania has the reputation of being the rockiest portion of the trail.  Past hikers joke that the rocks are all turned up on their edges and re-sharpened each night.  It will take me a few days to reach the 75 or so miles that are supposed to be really bad and I'm not looking forward to it...but, I'll get through it!

We had a couple of nice surprises today.  Beaker's friend, Ahmed, visited us on the trail and took us to brunch at a nearby cafe.  I really enjoyed meeting him and talking about the trail and scouting (his son is a Boy Scout).  His son just won an international award in Robotics and he is only in 8th grade.  What a nice guy and a great break from the trail.

We also had trail magic about a mile from reaching our campsite for the night.   Some kind soul left a cooler of juice boxes labeled ""For Thru-Hikers"".  There was still ice in the cooler.  It was another hot day and it really hit the spot.  Thank you so much whoever you are.

Beaker and I only did about 13.5 miles today.  We considered moving on to the next shelter, but it was almost 7 miles further and it was already close to 5 pm when we arrived and water was another 1/2 mile further.  In addition, it was thundering in the distance, the campsite was very nice, and we had signal for our phones.  I could tell he was wanting to press on but I was ready to stop for the day.  The stream is right next to the campsite and we were able to soak our feet and wash out our shirts.   Tomorrow, we plan to do almost 20 miles and we will start the day with a 1,000 ft climb.

The last couple of nights have been very hot so tonight I'm trying something different.  I carry a silk bag liner to keep my sleeping bag clean(er) but haven't been using it because it is hot and confining.  Tonight, I slipped it onto my air mattress like a sheet and I plan to use my sleeping bag like a blanket.  I can use the sleeping bag if it cools down enough or just toss it off me if it's too warm.  My wife is visiting next weekend and I think I will go ahead and switch it out for my summer quilt.

I'm also planning on switching shoes again.  I plan to go back to Keens.  The Oboz I'm wearing now seem just a little too thin and flexible on the bottom so I feel every rock.  I'm hoping the Keens will be better when the rocks get bad.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565451,"It was a big, big day for us today.  We originally planned only a 9-mile day and a hitchhike to a nearby town for a resupply but we both felt we had at least enough food for one more day.  However, we started our hike at 6:50 this morning and planned to hike a 20-mile day instead.

When we reached the 20-mile mark, it was only about 4 pm so we decided to hike the rest of the way to the General Store and stay in the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel.  At the end of our epic 29.5-mile day, we were greeted by a sign at the hostel stating it was closed for a special event.  We soon found out the nearby campground was also fully booked leaving us with the choice of going back the way we came, continue, or find a ride to town about 15 miles away.  Only one offered a shower and town food, so we called an Uber and made our way to the nearest hotel.

In addition to our long, long many mile day (my feet are aching), we also crossed the official halfway point today!  Even though we still have a long, long way to go, it was definitely a morale booster.

When we did finally reach the General Store, Hoops, The Captain, and one other thru-hiker were already waiting there.  All five of us are currently sharing a room.  It's crowded, but a lot less so than a shelter AND you don't have to hike a hundred yards to the privy.

In the morning, we will catch a ride back to the General Store.  This is the location for the “Half-Gallon Challenge”.  The challenge is to eat a half-gallon of ice cream in celebration of reaching the halfway point.  I'm pretty sure I won't be attempting this fest, especially at 10 am but who know what tomorrow will bring.

Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry in a little run down hotel.  I'm clean for the first time in several days.  I had a gas station sub sandwich and salad for dinner, washed down with a cold Mountain Dew.  I feel glorious (but exhausted).  I'm excited to begin the second half of my hike tomorrow and for all the adventures to come.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Tumbling Run Shelters

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565507,"It was a short hiking day for us today.  After our long hike yesterday, we found the hostel closed and the campground full.  We had to find a ride to town, find something to eat, and check into a hotel.  It was after 11 pm before we finally got to sleep.  That's way past Hiker's Midnight and much later than we are used to.  We decided to sleep in a little but by 6:30, Beaker and I were already awake and I’d finished my shower.  The younger folks took a little while longer to wake up but everyone was up by 7:00. 

We walked over to the nearby gas station/convenience store (the only place nearby) for breakfast and was working on finding a ride back to the trail when Trail Angel Ice Man pulled up and offered us a ride.  What a great guy, and he even brought fancy donuts and drinks. 

We had left the trail at the Pine Grove General Store.  As we were gathering our equipment, Sitting Bull came walking in.  We hadn't seen him since Harper's Ferry.  Hoops has been hiking with him for quite a while but he had to take a few days off due to shin splints and he was just catching up to her.  They are in tonight's picture.

The Pine Grove General Store is where the ""Half-Gallon Challenge"" takes place.  To celebrate reaching the half way point, many thru-hikers will consume a half gallon of ice cream here.  If you can do it, you get a little wooden spoon to commemorate your success (or you can get one for 10 cents).  I'm slightly lactose intolerant, and hopefully a little wiser than I once was, so I decided not to do it.  But, since it was nearing lunch time, I did have the Hiker's Burger and a small cone.  Both Sitting Bull and The Captain took on the challenge and were successful but, for just a minute or two near the end, I began to think Sitting Bulls' ice cream was going to make a second appearance.  He was starting to look mighty pale.

The AT Museum is also located here and Beaker and I spent about 30 minutes enjoying the exhibits.  The museum is very nicely done and I recommend it to anyone who happens to be in the area.

By the time we were ready to hike out, it was just past 1:00.  My feet were still tender from yesterday's long hike and we could hear thunder off in the distance, so when we reached the first shelter at 4:00, we decided to stop for the evening.  I believe we hiked just less than 8 miles today.

Tomorrow morning, at about the 1.5-mile point, we will reach another general store.  This one is supposed to have a deli.  We hope to have breakfast and pick up something for lunch.  And, since they are calling for rain all week, we hope to try out a new hostel tomorrow night.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565642,"Today, we made our way through several tough rock scrambles but we finished the day with almost two miles of field walking.  We will have about 14 more miles of open field walking in the morning.
We reached Boiling Springs at about 2:00 after about a 12.5-mile hiking day.  We considered continuing on but the next shelter was more than 14 miles further and neither Beaker nor I wanted to do a 26+ mile day today.  We also need a resupply.  We decided to stay at a new hostel in Boiling Springs, resupply in the morning, have breakfast at the local diner, then continue hiking. 

Tomorrow will also be a short day due to the distance between the shelters, but I don't mind.  The rocks are doing a number on my feet.  My wife is visiting this weekend and I will replace my shoes while we are together.  It's earlier than I was expecting to, but I can feel every rock and root through these shoes.  I'm hoping to find some with a thicker, stiffer sole.  I've usually worn Keens in the past.  I’ve been very satisfied with them and will probably go back to them.

We've been seeing a lot of flip-flopped on the trail the last few days.  Most of these folks started at Harper's Ferry and are headed North.  After reaching Katahdan, they will return to Harper's Ferry and head south.  It's interesting to see these folks are concerned about and act the same as we did almost three months ago.  Most are only hiking about 8-10 miles each day and are exhausted when they reach the shelter.  A benefit is they typically build a fire each night at the shelter; something we never do anymore.  Don't get me wrong, we all like a fire, but after a while, it's just not worth the effort it takes to build one...but us old-timers will enjoy it while it lasts.  Another benefit is extra food, tonight I had some toasted marshmallows.  We old-timers don't think they offer enough benefit to carry them...but we will sure eat them if someone else carries them.","James Fry Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565794,"Today was only about a 14-mile day.  One of the problems that often arise when you stay at a hostel is the fact that the owner dictates the schedule and you are stuck with it.  The place we stayed last night was about 3.5 miles from the trail.  The hostel owner shuttles back and forth/to and from the trail for free but we were unable to get the ride until after 8:30. Once we were back in town, we stopped at the local grocery store to resupply and, since we were walking past a diner anyway, we stopped in for breakfast.  Around noon, we we're crossing a local highway and realized there was another diner almost within throwing distance, so we stopped there too (actually, we already knew about both these places and couldn't resist stopping).

We really didn't want to go too far today because we knew some of our friends, Strider, Lumber Jill, Winter, Oz, Glimglom, Darwin, Leggs, etc., were returning from Trail Days in Damascus and planned to be at this shelter tonight and we wanted to see them again. They are all young, tend to hike faster and further than us, and we are planning on getting off the trail this weekend so we don't know when the next opportunity to see them will be.

I also ran into Squire and his two sons, Stretch (14 years old) and Remix (12 years old), this morning.  They just completed the 4-state challenge.  They started in Virginia, passed through West Virginia, through Maryland, and into Pennsylvania all within 24 hours--44+ miles total!  The AT Conservancy believes the two boys might be the youngest to ever successfully complete this challenge. 

We've also been hiking with Ringer the last couple of days.  She was the lady who found my wallet and returned it to me about 6 weeks ago.  It's nice to see her again too.

Tomorrow, we head into Duncannon.  It's only about 9 miles up the trail but we've been told it's a rough and rocky 9 miles.  We plan to stop at the Doyle Hotel for lunch and a beer.  The Doyle is as old as the trail and it is traditional to stop there.  We haven't decided yet if we will stay or just have lunch and press on.

Even though it has started to rain, tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry in my tent.  My feet are sore from the rocks already and I'm a little concerned about tomorrow, but we will get there.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Buck Off Hostel, Boiling Springs, PA

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565971,"Today is the first day of my fourth month on the trail.  My 12-mile hike to the Doyle Hotel in Duncannon, PA, marks the completion of approximately 1,150 miles total since I started this adventure.  The trail was pretty rocky and I've been told it will get a lot worse before it gets better.

I'm getting off the trail tomorrow for the long weekend.  My wife is going to meet me here in Duncannon and we are going to drive to Asheville, NC, for “Geowoodstock XV”.   Geowoodstock started in 2003 and is an annual geocaching event held somewhere in the US (location varies year to year) for the international community.  It's about a 9-hour ride down to Asheville and 9 hours back, but I'll spend that time with my wife, see friends from all over the country, and get a chance to rest for three days.  I've had this trip planned for a long time.

Another thing I plan to do this weekend is purchase new shoes.  The Oboz I'm currently wearing just don't have thick enough soles for the terrain.  I definitely need new shoes.  I feel every rock and the bottoms of my feet are very sore.  I may be forced back into boots if I can't find the right shoe.

We are currently staying in the Doyle Hotel.  The Doyle is infamous with hikers.  The building is well over 100 years old and appears to have had very little recent upkeep done.  As rough as it is, most hikers stay here, or at least stop for a meal.  We decided to do both.

The break is going to be nice and I definitely need the rest.  My feet need a chance to heal but this four days is going to put us way behind many of our friends and possibly into a new bubble all together.  It will be nice meeting new friends but I hope to see the others again too.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566341,"The day began after a restful sleep at the Doyle Hotel.  The only thing that woke me during the night was the sound of hard rain hitting the window beside my bed.  It was a good thing it was blowing in the direction it was because the other window at the head of my bed was wide open and didn't look like it had been closed in years.
The rain continued most of the night and was still steadily coming down in the morning.  It was a good night to be inside.  By about 6:30 am, Beaker and I were both awake (when you're used to going to bed with the sun, you tend to wake with it as well).  We heard Gibby up in the next room.  He was getting ready to go have breakfast before hiking out of town and we decided to join him.  I first met Gibby a few weeks ago, and we have shared camping sites and hostels several times since.  He is a previous thru-hiker who is doing the trail again as a section hiker.  By the time Beaker and I return to the trail, he will be many miles ahead of us and near the end of his section for this year.  We probably won't be able to catch him again.  It has been a real pleasure meeting him. 
While we went to breakfast with Gibby, Good Life continued to sleep on the floor of our room.  The night before, he had started to spread his sleeping bag on the old, very old, stained, carpet when I suggested he spread the blanket from my bed first.  At first he didn't want to take ""my blanket"" but when I told him I wasn't going to be using it because I was using my sleeping bag, he accepted it.  After spreading the blanket on the floor and seeing the condition it was in, he decided to cover it with his tent footprint too.  Probably a smart move on his part.  In retrospect, I kind of wish I had set up my entire tent in the room and just slept inside it.  I'm definitely glad I had previously treated my sleeping bag with Permethrin—it’s often used for treating/killing bedbugs.

 Good Life asked if we’d wake him up at 8:20 because he needed to contact the college he will be attending in the fall regarding his classes.  At exactly 8:20, the city's fire/tornado/air raid siren, easily visible atop the fire station, and only a couple of hundred feet from our window, began to wail.  Good Life popped upright and I told him his alarm clock had just gone off.  We’d set it just for him!  He laughed, greeted us with an infectious smile, and a big good morning.  The kid is so upbeat and happy all the time it just about pisses you off after a while.  Just kidding, he can brighten even the rainiest day.
 Check out time was at 10 am, strictly enforced by charging your credit card for another day.  By 9:45, Good Life had still not returned from making his phone call to the school and his sleeping bag and equipment was spread throughout the room. I decided to give him a quick call to avoid being charged for an additional night at the hotel only to find he’d entered a pancake-eating challenge at the restaurant across the street.  He was attempting to eat 8 manhole-cover-size pancakes.  If he could do it, his breakfast would be free.  He was on #4 when I called.  After explaining the situation, the restaurant owner agreed to allow him to return to the room and get his stuff...but, he better not cheat!
Since we had nowhere else to go, and it was probably the best entertainment in town anyway, Beaker and I followed him back across the street to watch him continue his challenge.  Unfortunately, midway through pancake #5, Good Life wasn't looking or feeling too good and decided he couldn't stomach another bite.  The existing record of seven cakes eaten by one individual still stands.  Good Life went down in flames instead of everlasting pancake fame. My picture for today is of Good Life trying to decide if one more bite will be one bite too many.
 After the pancake fiasco, Beaker and I, having nothing else to do to kill time, donned our packs, and broke a cardinal rule of thru-hikers, we hiked nearly a mile down the road, off the trail, to the old sled factory.  We’d been told by a local on the trail that it was now a museum filled with strange and wondrous relics of the past.  It was actually, primarily, a flea market filled with castoffs from generations of knick-knack collectors.  We searched hard but couldn't find a single item we wanted to add to our packs, although a vintage, circa 1973, Speedy Gonzales glass came close.  On the way back to the Doyle, where we were to meet my wife, we stopped by an ice cream stand and had a cup of raspberry ice cream.
 My wife arrived at 1:30.  Our original plan was to find a nearby hotel and then head south in the morning.   I'm sure I've mentioned in several of my posts that I like to go geocaching.  We are planning to attend Geowoodstock in Waynesville, NC.  It’s similar to Sturgis, but for geocaching nerds, and not nearly as cool.   But, since it was still early in the day, we decided to drive on down.  We met Ms. Beaker on the way to drop off Beaker so he could spend time with his wife too.  Our timing was perfect, we reached our meeting point within 5 minutes of each other and left Beaker with his much, much, much, better half (I'm not kidding here, this guy really managed to marry up).  We will meet up again on Sunday to head back to the trail.
I'm currently at our hotel room.  I'm looking forward to spending time with my wife and seeing friends from around the country.  Tonight, I'm safe, warm, dry, clean, and sleeping in a comfortable, clean, hotel room.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","The Doyle Hotel, Duncannon, PA

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566704,"Tomorrow, we head back out on the trail after a three day break to see our wives, visit with friends, and make a few changes in our gear.  The picture shows most of my gear laid out on the bed in our hotel room.  All I have left to do is stuff it in my pack and I'm ready to hike.

One of the major changes I made was to my footwear.  My feet have taken a beating the last few weeks and we're barely into the rocks of Pennsylvania.  The Oboz trail runners just did not provide enough protection.  The only thing I can think to compare it to is walking barefoot on Legos all day.  Even after three days off, my feet are still tender.  The shoes also didn't fit quite right (the toebox was too small and no matter how much I tightened them, my heels would slip up and down).  I ended up with a raw spot between my two smallest toes on my right foot and blisters on both heels. I replaced the shoes but also added sock liners.  As I type, my feet are still sore, but much better than they were just three days ago.  Hopefully, they will continue to improve over the next few days.

Another major change is to my sleeping equipment.  I've traded my 35-degree bag for (I'm estimating) a 50-degree quilt.  The sleeping bag was just too hot.  To make the quilt, I purchased two 50""X70"" down throws from Costco.  I had my wife take a piece from one throw and add it to the other to lengthen it.  I then had her sew in a foot box.  She did a wonderful job and I ended up with a down summer quilt that weighs less than a pound.  I'm going to continue to carry my light weight thermals and a sleeping bag liner just in case it gets cold again.  I've always planned to keep my down jacket for the entire trip so this is not an addition.  Overall, I've probably taken another 1/2 lb. off my back and added some more empty space to my pack.

Although I'm not looking forward to leaving my wife again, I am excited about getting back on the trail and testing my new equipment, even if they are calling for rain tomorrow and Tuesday.  But tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry in a hotel room.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","The Doyle Hotel, Duncannon, PA

Around noon, we were greeted by the trail magic sign in the picture.  John, Mike, Charlie, and Phil Fogarty have been having a family reunion at their cabin at the edge of the trail for more than 20 years and they always invite any thru-hikers who happen to be passing through to stop by.   About 50 family members and friends were there and at least a half-dozen hikers.  What an incredibly nice family and the food was delicious, plentiful, and much appreciated.

Beaker and I hiked approximately 16.5 miles today.  I was a little concerned about my feet and my new shoes but now that I'm laying here in my tent relaxing.  I don't think my feet are in any more pain (at least not much more) than they normally do after a day of hiking.  I think these shoes are going to do the trick but only time and miles will tell.  I'm hoping my feet continue to improve each day.  But, no kidding, these rocks in Pennsylvania are no joke and I don't even think we've hit the rough stuff yet.

There is only a 30% chance of rain tonight but chances are supposed to increase after 8 am.  I hope they're right and I have a chance to pack up before it starts...or better yet, I hope they're wrong and the rain misses us entirely.  I believe there is a slight possibility of rain most of the week with an increasing possibility this coming weekend.  As they say, ""No rain, No Maine"" (but, I for one, think we have had our fair share already).

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566854,"What a day! 

First, the weather man was totally wrong.  It began to rain around midnight last night and was still raining at 9 pm tonight.  Okay, it did stop a few times throughout the day but it was hard to tell when it stopped because during the lulls, it would just on us from the trees.

Next, our original plan was to do 15-17 miles today and then find a nice camping spot.  But, by noon, we had already hiked 13 miles.  None of the camping sites we passed looked good.  Actually, several spots had standing water in them.  At some point, we decided to do 13 more miles and spend the night at a shelter.  We finally pulled reached the William Penn Shelter at about 7:15 pm after about 26 miles.  As I said the last time we hiked a crazy number of miles, “I'm not doing that again.”  But, then again, I’ll probably say it again.  

Not only did the last half of today’s hike contain a 1,000-ft. climb, it also covered the rockiest portion of the trail that I’ve hiked so far.  The rocks are almost indescribable.  They are as bad, if not worse, than anyone has told me.  I'll try to get some photos in the next few days but so far, just trying to walk in/on them has taken my full concentration.  Imagine walking through/over rocks, many loose and wobbly, others with jagged edges sticking straight up, and most of them being between the size of your fist and the size of a volleyball.  And, to top it off, I've been told we haven't even entered the worst areas yet.

Next, I've got less than 1,000 miles left to go!  It's going quick and I'm not trying to rush my adventure, but I miss my family and my home.  
My picture today is of a raindrop covered wild rose.  Sometimes, the fragrance of the roses on the trail is so strong it is almost overpowering.  As I lay here in the shelter in my sleeping bag writing this, I can smell them in the night air.  Not a bad scent to fall to sleep to.

Talking about scents...I'm sure we stink...very badly at times.  We do the best we can.  We shower when possible, wash in streams, clean up with wet wipes, etc., but, we still smell.  Funny thing though, we don't smell each other.  However, we definitely smell the day hikers when they pass us by, and for at least another 100 yards down the trail.  The smell of shampoo, conditioner, lotions, perfumes, deodorant, lip gloss, soap, laundry detergent, bug spray, etc., is incredibly strong and smells like the person has just gotten out of a chemical bath. 

Tonight, I'm exhausted.  My feet hurt, my muscles are cramping, and my body can't seem to stop trembling.  But, I'm safe, warm, and dry in a shelter.  I'm hoping the sun will be shining in the morning, but sun or rain, I'm looking forward to tomorrow's hike.  I'm a lucky man to have the opportunity to live out this dream.  I hope you have your chance too.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566976,"I woke this morning at around 5:30 am to a thunderstorm so I just rolled over and went back to sleep.  At about 6:30 am, the storm had passed and we finally got up.  By the time we hit the trail, the sun had come out and the day ended up being beautiful.
At about 9 am, we met “Earnhart” at a road crossing.  He is a 2016 thru-hiker who was setting up to do trail magic.  If we had started out at our regular time this morning, we would have totally missed him.  It just goes to prove that every cloud is a silver lining, or in this case, a Mountain Dew and a Snickers Bar.  We visited a while until some other thru-hikers arrived and then we moved on.  What a pleasure to meet him and his dog Clyde.

At about 1:00, after a rough morning navigating the rocks, we stopped at a pretty little stream.  We threw our Dews in the water to cool, hung a line and stretched our tarps out in the sun, and then soaked our feet in the stream while we enjoyed our lunch and cold soda.  It felt almost Huckleberry Finn-like. Then, to complete the mental image, Beaker pulled out an apple, sliced it in half, and presented me with it...I didn't even have to whitewash the fence.

Later in the day, we stopped and talked with ""Cheap Sunglasses"", ""Rabbit"", and ""Piccolo"".  We met the first two several times in the past and enjoyed talking with them.  We really enjoyed meeting Piccolo too.  Piccolo is currently camping about 30 feet away from me, the other two continued up the trail.

I attached a picture of a portion of the trail today.  It wasn't all like this, but too much of it was.  But even with the rocks, we hiked 18 miles today and my feet held up surprisingly well.  Hopefully, they are finally on the mend and won't continue to be a painful concern for me.

Tomorrow, we will reach Port Clinton where I pick up my resupply box at the Post Office.  Afterwards, we will hitch a ride to the next town over so Beaker can resupply at the Walmart and get new shoes at Cabela's.  We might even grab a slice of pizza or a burger while we're in town, but we hope to finish our errands early enough to return to the trail be at the next shelter before dark.


Tonight, I'm tired once again, but I'm also safe, warm, and dry.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","William Penn Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567078,"As is so often the case, plans change.  Beaker and I had planned to get up early, hike to Port Clinton, pick up my mail drop at the post office, then hitch a ride to Cabela's about 2 miles away, find him some new shoes, return to the trail, and hike about 6 or so more miles to the next shelter.

Things worked great until we arrived in town.  The post office wasn't open yet so we decided to go to the nearby hotel/restaurant for lunch.  As soon as we arrived there, two of my favorite people on the trail, Sitting Bull and Hoops, came running up.  We hadn't seen them for about a week and thought they had gotten way ahead of us while we were off the trail.  It was great to see them and we enjoyed an extended lunch while we caught up. 

Beaker and I then attempted to hitch a ride to Cabela's but had no luck at all.  To be totally honest, traffic was heavy and there really wasn't a safe place for anyone to pull over.  We ended up hiking the whole way there (more time lost).  After finally getting to Cabela's, and after about an hour of searching, we learned they did not have a single pair of size 14 hiking shoes in any brand or style.  Beaker ended up calling his wife and she ordered him some shoes from REI.  They will be delivered about 60 miles up the trail in about 3 days.

By this time, most of the afternoon was gone.  We decided a hotel might be our best option.  At least we would be able to shower and get our clothes washed, but after several phone calls, we were still without a home for the night.  That's when I remembered Sitting Bull and Hoops telling us about a great little hostel called ""Rock and Sole"" they'd stayed in a couple of days ago.  Road miles and trail miles are often quite different so I gave them a call.  Not only were they willing to pick us up at the Cabela's, one of the owners was near our location and could be there within 15 minutes. 

It wasn't long and we were at the hostel.  Showers were quickly taken care of and dirty laundry was turned over to be cleaned.  Our stay included a dinner that was incredible and I'm sure breakfast will be too.  After breakfast, we will get a ride back to the trail head.

Although we only managed about 9 miles today, I thoroughly enjoyed the day and that's a big part of this crazy adventure!  I'm excited to see what tomorrow brings.

Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry.  My wet tent and equipment is dry and repacked.  My clothes are washed and I am clean.  I'm sleeping in a nice bunk with fresh clean sheets and my feet had a little bit of a reprieve from the rocks this afternoon.  Tomorrow is another day.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Eagles Nest Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567269,"We began the day with an incredible breakfast at the Rock N Sole Hostel.  Ms. Jody was an incredible hostess and a wonderful cook.  After a delicious omelet, English muffins with strawberry jam, fresh orange juice, and great coffee, her husband, Craig, gave us a ride back to Port Clinton.

Port Clinton has a pavilion and tent camping area for thru-hikers and as we were passing it, we saw our young friend, known as ""Ramsey Bolton"", getting out of his tent.  We asked to be dropped off there and spent a few minutes visiting with him.  Ramsey still needed to resupply and wasn't planning on leaving town until later in the day, so after catching up, we headed out to the trail.  Hopefully, he will catch us in the next few days.

We had heard great things about the local barber shop being friendly to hikers and having an AT Passport Stamp.  Hikers have a souvenir book that can be stamped at various locations along the trail.  Most hikers don't do it, but I enjoy it and have mine stamped whenever the opportunity arises.  Inside, we met the owner Frank and his father.  Frank is 69 and his father is 90, both have been cutting hair most of their lives and are still working today.  Both, stopped cutting hair long enough to serve our nation.  Frank was in the Marines during the Vietnam War and his father in the Navy in WWII.  I thanked both for their service and decided to get my beard trimmed while I was there.  Just how often can you get an old-fashioned shave and a haircut from a WWII veteran? 

Frank's dad served in the Pacific and was involved in a battle in June of 1944 known as ""Operation Hailstorm"" where the US attacked ""Truk Atoll"", the Japanese' Pearl Harbor, and sank more than 100 ships.  He was amazed to learn I had once lived on Truk Atoll, and had scuba dove on many of the same ships he helped to place at the bottom of the ocean.  He was tickled when I told him how great a job they did destroying those warships, especially when I described the size and number of holes they had placed in them.  What an honor it was to meet these two men and it was definitely one of the highpoints of my hike so far.  

In between cutting hair, Frank will also give you a free estimate on the value of any gold and silver jewelry or coins you have...just to make sure you get a fair deal when you sell it elsewhere.  He also gives ""5-minute"" guitar lessons at no charge and you can come in any time for another lesson.  He's a member of a band who ""jam"" right there in the barber shop most weekends.

After visiting for way too long, Beaker and I headed on out of town for the second time, only to realize about a half mile down the trail that Beaker had left his hat in the barber shop.  I watched the packs while he ran back and got it.

We took a leisurely lunch at the first shelter we came to and another at a great view point in the middle of the afternoon.  With all our stops, we only managed about 15 miles today but I wouldn't change any of it.  It was a great day.

Tonight, we are safe, warm, and dry in a shelter.  They are calling for rain in the early hours of the morning but, with a little luck, it will have passed by the time we start out tomorrow.  Right now, we're panning about a 17.5-mile day but who knows what tomorrow may bring.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Rock and Sole Hostel

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567279,"We woke up this morning to rain.  It ended within an hour of us starting our hike and was beautiful the rest of the day.

Luckily for us, the rocks dried pretty quickly.  There were a lot of them on the trail and they were slick enough even when dry.  I managed to remain on my feet all day but it was close a couple of times.

We managed to make about 17.5 miles today but I felt the going was slow.  For the last few weeks, my feet have been giving me trouble and the rocks are only making it worse.  Right now, I have about as much tape on my feet as I have exposed skin.  I'm really hoping that once we leave Pennsylvania, they will finally begin to heal. Only about 60 miles to go!  

About 8 of us stopped at a restaurant today for lunch.  As we travel further north, restaurants and deli’s near the trail have become more common.  Although they are more expensive than preparing our own meals, they allow us to go further between resupplying and add variety (and probably needed nutrients) to our diet.  I'm hoping they continue!

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567430,"The day started out nice.  But, by noon, it started to rain again and rained for most of the rest of the day.  We considered going into Palmerton for lunch but the climb out is one of the steepest on the trail and we really wanted to be over the top before the rocks got wet and slippery.  We barely made it.  Even then, it was scarier than I like.  I'm just a little afraid of heights and this would have probably been pushing it for me if the rocks were wet.

We continued on for a total of about 17.5 miles today.  At that point, my feet had all they could take.  I know I've mentioned it several times already and I don't want to come across as a total whiner but the rain, and now these rocks, have really done a number on my feet.  Luckily for me, Beaker's wife is visiting in two days, so I will be taking a Zero (and, hopefully a Nero).  I don't think the one-day break will repair the damage but we will soon be leaving Pennsylvania, and the rocks, behind.  If that doesn't do it, I may have to take a week off to recover.  I'll just have to see how it goes.  I might have to slow down some too.

I had to set my tent up tonight on wet ground in a pouring rain.  This is the first time my tent has been wet on the inside.  I actually soaked up puddles with my hanky.  I'm hoping the water is not coming up through the floor but I expect everything will be at least a little bit wet in the morning.

Tonight I'm safe, damp, and a little chilled but I'll warm up in a bit.  If not, I still have a dry puffy jacket I can put on.  Hopefully, the sun will be shining in the morning and I can dry out some of my gear.   Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

Beaker is meeting his wife at Delaware Water Gap at 3 pm tomorrow. He is then going to zero with her the next day.  I plan on slowly make my way there and then zero in a church hostel with several other hikers I know.  If my feet done improve by then, I might have to remain off the trail for a few more days.  I'll just have to wait and see how it goes.

My picture tonight is of the rocks on the trail.  The big rocks really aren't the problem.  It's the smaller ones that are pointed that do the most damage.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567752,"I'd like to say last night's stay in the hotel was wonderful but the place was a real dump.  Possibly, the worst I've ever stayed in.  To make matters even worse, our ""friend"" Matador came to visit and brought a woman who he had only just met in the parking lot right behind him.  It was immediately apparent this woman wasn't quite all there, possibly because of the glass of alcohol she was drinking from, possibly some other substance, or perhaps both.  Now please don't misunderstand, Matador is naturally gregarious and he spoke to her briefly as he passed her in the parking lot. When she saw where he was headed, she followed along.  She followed him right into our room.  Matador then sat on the edge of the bed and enjoyed the “show”.  When he’d had enough, he left leaving his new best buddy in our room with us.
Upon entering the room, she immediately started telling us the room was haunted.  She said she used to live in the room before moving next door. There was a boarded-up hole in the wall where the closet used to be.  She told us it was a “vortex to Hell”.  She informed us she had dealt with Gods and Devils in the past, and there was definitely a vortex behind the boards.  She told us she had once pried the old door open and looked down, down, down into the depths of Hell”.  She said she had even dumped two bottles if bleach into the hole to eradicate the demons.  I was amazed, I had never known that common household bleach doubled as holy water!  After moving her to another room, the management boarded up the opening again and continued to rent the room to unsuspecting hikers.

As she was finishing her harrowing tale, I reached over and turned on the AC and we were immediately thrown into the dark.  For just a moment I thought the vortex was opening.  But she quickly explained the electric was haunted too and we needed to quickly plug something into an outlet on the other side of the room to save ourselves.  I handed her my phone charger, she plugged it in, and to our surprise, the lights and A/C came back on.  I had to use this life saving procedure twice more during the night---once at around midnight.  Each time, I think I just barely stopped the vortex from opening (actually, the outlet had a short and wiggling it would cause it to work again, but she was convinced it was haunted).

After such an exciting evening and a shower of only very hot water (wet down as quickly as possible, turn off the steaming water, soap up, and then rinse as quickly as possible), Beaker and I left the hotel at about 6:15 am.  We weren't well rested but we were happy to get away unscathed.   After stopping at Dunkin Donuts for coffee and breakfast, a stop at a convenience store for snacks, and the 1.9 hike miles back to the trailhead, it was just after 7:30 when we started actually started hiking the trail for the day.  As has most often been the case lately, it rained much of the day.  We reached Delaware Water Gap just before 3 pm after completing approximately 15.5 miles of the trail.  Beaker then went off to spend the evening with his wife,.  After last night, I chose to spend the night in the Church of the Mountain Hostel.  Holy ground seemed the best way to go tonight!.
Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry sleeping in a church.  Tomorrow, I plan to do a zero here and resupply for the next leg of my adventure in New Jersey.  Pennsylvania is a beautiful place filled with incredibly nice people, but I'll be glad to leave it and the rocks behind.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567806,"I actually slept in until after 8 am this morning and could have probably slept later, but everyone in the hostel except me was already up.  I don't sleep that late even on the weekends when I'm at home.
After getting up, I joined the everyone for a hike down to the local eatery/bakery/farmer's market/plant nursery for a cup of coffee, an egg sandwich, and fresh cinnamon bun.  All of it was superb.
After breakfast, I caught a ride to a Walmart in a nearby town to resupply my food stores.  I also picked up more tape for my feet and some Epsom Salts (I noticed a foot spa under a side table at the hostel and planned to put it to good use).
Upon returning to the hostel, I spent about an hour cleaning the spa machine, poured in some salts, and filled it with hot water.  It was incredible.  I’d been concerned about being ridiculed, but other hikers were lining up to use the machine after me.  Now, more than 8 hours later, it's still being used.  Its steady use has also resulted in the added benefit of replacing the reek of old, wet, hikers permeating the entire hostel with a delightful fragrance of lemon grass oil, citrus, and menthol.  Possibly, the best this room has smelled since the hostel opened in 1978.
After soaking my feet, I made a trip down the street to the local outfitters and picked up the few items that I couldn't find at Walmart, such as gas for my cook stove and a couple of dehydrated meals.  I also picked up some “Superfeet” inserts for my shoes and another new pair of socks.  Then, it was off to lunch at the local ice cream shop (in business since 1903) where I had the special:  two hotdogs and a chocolate malt.
Afterwards, I went back to the hostel, where I packed my meals for the next five days.  I will probably need to resupply again sooner, but the next possible resupply location won't have the selection Walmart has.  So, I'm carrying as much as I feel I comfortably can.
The rest of the afternoon was spent relaxing and trying to keep my sore feet elevated before heading off to dinner with the gang at a nearby pizza parlor and topped off with another piece of pie at the pie shop.
I guess the bottom line is...almost a perfect zero day!   And, my feet are feeling much better!  I'm hoping the today’s rest, the new socks, new insoles, tape, and spa treatment (and leaving Pennsylvania) might finally have my feet on the mend.

So far, New Jersey has been beautiful.  Some of that may be due to having a much better attitude because my feet are improving.  And, some of it might be because today was just a beautiful day for hiking.  But, much of it is because New Jersey is just a beautiful place.  I know in the past, I had a preconceived notion that NJ was nothing but factories and industrial areas…but, it’s not called the ""Garden State for nothing.  I'd had an opportunity to hike here a few years back and was surprised at how beautiful it was.  I'm looking forward to the approximately 80 miles I will hike through NJ over the next few days.

New Jersey is also supposed to be the state with the most bear sightings.  I've only seen one on my trip so far and it was in the Shenandoah’s.  I hope to safely see a couple more before I'm done.  On the other hand, Beaker and I did see at least 4 snakes today.  None of them were poisonous, but one did make me jump when it moved within inches of my feet.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568053,"Today, was another beautiful hiking day and Beaker and I were covered 20.5 miles.  So far, New Jersey has been a treat.  We stopped today for lunch (and a cold beer for me) at a tavern just two-tenths of a mile off the trail.  Although more expensive than eating out of our food bags, these stops provide a nice break from the trail and a nice change to our usual fare.  Honestly, you can only eat so much tuna, spam, and peanut butter.
Several other hikers were already there, or came in while we were having lunch.  Before my hike, I thought the trip would mostly be about the trail itself.  About the woods, the animals, the sunrises, and sunsets, etc.  While all this is important, I have found my journey to be more about the people on the trail.  I have met so many incredible people and I am humbled to be a part of such a great group of folks.  At this stage of the hike, most of the young people (to me, that's anyone less than 30) still on the trail are amazingly smart and dedicated.  I have no doubts that the vast majority of them will accomplish great things in their lifetimes.  These folks get up early every morning, bandage the blisters on their feet, shovel down oatmeal for the 100th day in a row, and then proceed to hike 25 or even 30 miles before stopping for the evening.  I have met a man with a pacemaker who knocks out the miles each day.  He is getting everything out of life he possibly can.  I've met two individuals with artificial legs, one from above the knee, and are knocking out 20-30 mile days.  And, I've met a 12 and 14-year old who might have just set a new record for the youngest two people to complete the 4-state challenge--they hiked 44+ miles in a single day!

I've also met some great people hiking on the trail from around the world, too.  I am grateful I can count ""Friendly Ghost and Beetle"" from Denmark, ""Dirty Harry"" from Australia, ""Beast"" from Switzerland, ""Powerhouse"" from Germany, ""Froggy"" from France, .and many others, as my friends.

The trail is about the hike, the snow in the Smokies, the rocks in Pennsylvania, the views from the mountain tops, the bears, the flowers, and the wild ponies. But I think, what I will remember the most, are the people I've met along the way and the adventures we shared.

Tonight's picture is of a Wild American Iris.  This is one of my favorite flowers.  It was very common in my town when I was growing up and always reminds me of warm summer evenings when I was a kid.

Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry in my tent in New Jersey.  Earlier, I heard coyotes, and an owl a moment ago.  Even after more than 100 days on the trail, I'm excited about tomorrow's hike, the sights I will see, and the people I will meet.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Stealth Campsite in New Jersey

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568164,"Today was like a hiking holiday.  The weather and the trail were perfect.  We started out at about 7:15 but stopped at the High Pointe State Park Visitor’s Center.  The park stamped my AT Passport and provided us with a free soft drink.  We then spent about 45 minutes charging our electronics before heading out again.

After leaving the Visitor's Center, we came to an observation tower where we could view the obelisk honoring all past military members.  It’s located atop the highest point in New Jersey.  We then decided to leave the AT trail and hike up to the memorial and climb the 291 steps to the top of the tower.  What a phenomenal view at the top.

After returning to the trail, we continued about 3 miles until we came upon two of my friends from Upstate New York, both named Sue, who came down to geocache the area and perform Trail Magic.  It was wonderful to see them and their Trail Magic was perfect. 

By this time, it was mid-afternoon and we still had about 5 miles to go before we would reach Unionville where we planned to resupply and camp for the evening.  My friends were going to meet us for dinner at a restaurant in town later in the day.

When we arrived in town, we learned there was no shower available and decided to take the girls up on their offer to give us a ride to a hotel.  The hotel they were staying didn’t have any more rooms available but we were able to find a room in a hotel just down the road.  They also ran us to Walmart to resupply and to get our laundry cleaned.

Even though we only ended up walking about 13.5 miles today, I consider it an excellent day.  I visited and shared dinner with four friends (Beaker was there and Sitting Bull caught up and joined us for dinner too), showered, did my laundry, and settled down in a nice hotel for the night.  My friends will pick us up in the morning and drop us off at the trail. It was almost a perfect day!

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568293,"It was another nice day for hiking today, except the temperature got up to 91 degrees.  When it gets this hot it is almost impossible to drink enough water and very easy to get dehydrated.  And, though I may be suffering from some dehydration, we were pretty lucky in finding areas to resupply.

One of the things we try to do before starting the day and each time we stop and refill is to “camel-up”.  Meaning we drink about a liter of water before starting the hiking day and at least a liter at each refill.  Although some hikers only carry one liter of water to save on weight, Beaker and I usually carry two.  Today we started with two.  

We received trail magic at about 9:00 am when we found a cooler of iced soda at a road crossing.  Soda isn't nearly as good as water for hydration but it is at least wet, cool, and the sugar helps to energize you too.  Around 11:00 am we were able to refill our water supply and camel-up again at a vacant home owned by the ATC.  They keep the outside hose bib in service just for the hikers.  At about 2:30 pm, we stopped at a farmer’s market right off the trail at a road crossing.  Not only did we get a chance to refill our water bottles, but I also had two Gatorades (Beaker and I also had a scoop of black raspberry ice cream).  We rested in the shade at the farmer's market for about 30 minutes before tackling the boardwalk across the swamp and the nearly 1,000 ft. climb back up into the hills.  

Finally, after setting up our sleeping areas for the night, we made a 0.4-mile hike to a nearby park’s visitor center and refilled once again.  We also used the facility to wash our shirts out for tomorrow.  It isn't always this easy to refill your water supply and most of the time, we filter water from springs and streams.  But on days as hot as today was, easy is not only nice, it's essential.

Even as hot as it was today, we still managed to hike 17.5 miles.  Tomorrow is supposed to be just as hot.  Hopefully, we can hike another 17.

We hiked about 17.5 miles today and we are camping at a primitive campsite alongside the trail near Little Dam Lake.  Clean, clear water was difficult to find today and we needed a lot of it because of the temperature.  Luckily, we were able to refill at the creamery, and then again at a road crossing just before reaching our campsite.  A wonderful trail angel had left about 12 gallons of water at the road crossing and the jugs were still cool when we came across them.  I was worried about having enough water but it ended up that we were able to drink our fill and then refill our containers before moving on.  Tomorrow is supposed to be nearly as hot as it was today.  Hopefully, finding water won't be a problem.

We made it all the way through New Jersey without seeing a single bear.  New Jersey is where they are supposed to be the thickest.  But even though I didn't see any bears, I did see more snakes, squirrels, chipmunks, deer, frogs, etc., than any other state we’ve traveled through so far.  Maybe we'll see another bear in New York. 

Tonight, I'm safe, dry, and too warm in my tent.  But, I'm not complaining, at least it isn't raining!  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Wawayanda Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568543,"Today was another very hot day with the temperature breaking records at about 95 degrees.  To add insult to injury, water was difficult to come by again today.  We only managed about 12.5 official trail miles and a 0.6-mile side trip to a state park.  We were able to refill our containers at the park but, because of concerns about availability of water at our campsite, we also filled our backup containers and carried them the last 4.5 miles to the campsite.  The added weight took its toll and slowed us down even more.

I'm sure I drank at least 1.5 gals of water today.  While we were at the state park, we hit the vending machines and I drank two 20-oz bottles of Gatorade and two Cokes.  I still feel like I haven't had enough to drink. 

Just after setting up camp, a thunderstorm blew in.  It didn't drop much rain but it really helped to lower the temperature.  We should be able to sleep tonight better than the last two nights were.  As I'm typing this, I can still hear thunder off in the distance and see an occasional flash of lightning.  I hope the storm is soon over but the coolness remains.

The last three days have been basically a rock scramble.  Some of the climbs have been difficult and one earlier today was slightly dangerous.  The trail split with a sign and arrow offering ""The Easy Way"".  But the white blazes marking the AT were the other way.  Beaker and I stayed on the AT following the white blazes.  At one climb, it took almost a leap of faith for me to get up to the next level.  Believe me, a 35lb pack on your back makes it a whole different ball game.  Even though we both safely made it to the top, we learned later that a young friend of ours wasn't so lucky.  He fell at the exact location, bounced, and fell to the next level down.  Luckily, he wasn't too badly injured.  It could have been very serious and even fatal.  He received a puncture wound to his leg.  Beaker is a paramedic and was able to perform some first aid when we met him at the shelter.  However, he will still require a trip to a doctor tomorrow. 

Tonight, I'm tired and still thirsty, but I'm safe, dry, and still a little too warm.  Tomorrow is supposed to be much cooler with a high in the upper 70s.  I can't wait!  At some point, somewhere tomorrow, we need to resupply.  Both of us are down to our last breakfast and lunch but I'll worry about that in the morning.  For now, goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Primitive Campsite Near Little Dam Lake

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568675,"Beaker and I did a “nero” today after 10.2 miles.  We reached the Bear Mountain Bridge after passing through the zoo and the lowest point on the AT (114 feet above sea level) at about noon.  We were picked up by our shuttle to the Stony Point Center (our quarters for the evening) about 20 mins later.
The hike this morning was wonderful, even if the black flies were dive bombing us for the first mile.  I've never understood why insects seem to try so hard to fly into your mouth, up your nose, and into your ears.  The temperature, although still warm, was at least 10 degrees cooler than yesterday, and more importantly, the humidity was way down.  I passed the 1400-mile point today!
I said the hiking was great; I didn't say it wasn't challenging.  This morning was another adventure in rock scrambling.  There were also several hundred stone steps to climb and descend.  I knew we were going to reach the lowest elevation of the entire trail today, and as usual, I hadn't studied the topography like I should have, so after the first assent, I expected it to be all downhill from there.  Unfortunately, we ended up climbing and descending three more times before finally reaching the area near the zoo.  I'm not complaining, the weather was nice, I was feeling good, my food bag was almost empty making for a light pack...and we were headed to town!  Showers, clean clothes, and town food were just a few miles ahead.  I nearly skipped down the trail.
The only real low point of the day was the zoo.  After waiting and watching for months to see bears on the trail, the two bears in their pen were just sad.  I wanted to find a way to let them out, to return back to the woods where they belong.  Who knows, maybe the bears are happy there.  Their food comes easy, and is probably more nutritiously sound than what they get in the wild.  They are protected against sickness and disease (and hunters) and will probably live longer in captivity than they would in the wild...but, I'd still rather see them free.
After we arrived our quarters for the night, we asked the lady at the desk about food shopping for our resupply.  She told us there was a grocery store about a mile away and we could probably get a volunteer to give us a ride there, but would have to walk back.  I had my doubts about it being a mile away and sadly, I was right.  It seems most really can't determine accurate distances and five minutes away in a vehicle can be five miles away on foot.  And no, just because we hike every day doesn’t mean we want to hike extra miles to the grocery store.  We did catch a ride to the store and it was about a three-mile walk back.  On a good note...the grocery was located right next to a great little pizza place.  We stopped there first for a couple of slices. The walk back wasn't bad…the weather was still nice and Beaker is good company.
Tonight, I'm safe, clean, and dry.  Tomorrow morning at 6:30 am. we will head back to the trail and start our day by crossing the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568809,"Tonight, Beaker and I are with about 12 other hikers camping at Clarence Fahnestock State Park.  Not only did we get a chance to take a hot shower, but a local Italian restaurant delivers here.  Instead of my usual pizza, I had a garden salad and shrimp scampi and linguine.  It was phenomenal!  Well, almost as good as my New York Italian wife's.  I also carried a can of beer with me from a deli at a road crossing where we had stopped this morning to eat. I cooled it down in a sink of cold well water.  I'm really loving this portion of the hike.  There seems to be restaurants or delis at every road crossing.  I think I might actually be in danger of gaining weight...I hope it continues all the way to Maine!
My hiking friend ""Ramsey Bolton"" was joined on the trail today by a high school buddy.  They will hike together for the next few days.  Usually, unless you already have a trail name, it takes a few days to ""earn"" your name.  Keeping up with a thru-hiker is tough.  Especially after we've been on the trail for a couple of months and have gotten our trail legs. It took Ramsey's friend about 5 minutes to get his name.  He is now known as “Reek”.
I met a flip flopper a few days ago who started at Harper's Ferry heading North.  We saw her again today at a road crossing hoping to catch a ride to town for medical care.  Her thighs were so chafed she had been bleeding.  She wrapped her legs with gauze and then used duct tape to hold it in place.  Her feet were in a similar condition.  Chafing out here is no joke.  It can be debilitating and can end your hike.  I've been very lucky and haven't had a problem but I always carry medication just in case.  I have given some of it to three other hikers who could barely continue to walk.   If you ever decide to make a long hike, I recommend you be prepared.
My picture tonight is of one of the hundreds of stone walls I have seen on my hike so far.  Some of these walls have been here for hundreds of years.  Further south, we passed through Civil War battlefields and now, through American Revolution battlefields.  I can't help but imagine young soldiers returning fire upon their enemy from behind these exact same stones.  There is a lot of history along the trail.  Some of it is as old as our nation and some goes back even further to times when only Native Americans lived here.  I was lucky enough to recently pass through Beck County, Pennsylvania.  It was the home of one of my earliest European ancestors who lived in what would become the United States.  He fought in the American Revolution and was married to a Native American.  I can trace my family directly back to them.  It was exciting to walk through the area.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568893,"Tonight, we are camping at the Morgan Stewart Memorial Shelter with at least 20 other hikers and folks continue to arrive.  This is the most people I've seen at a shelter since Georgia.
I believe there several reasons for the crowd.  About half the people here are flip floppers and have only been on the trail since Harper's Ferry or even more recently.  Two couples here tonight have only been on the trail for three days. 
I believe another reason for the crowd is due to the lack of shelters and suitable campsites nearby.  Today, we only did 14 miles.  If we had wanted to go to the next shelter, it would have been a 25-mile day.  We can do it, we have in the past, but 25 miles a day is more than we, or most people, want to do.
The final reason is due to the lack of quality water.  The streams here have not been the crystal-clear water we’re had up to now.  Most are at least tannin stained to a tea color and some are much worse and/or have a high sodium, metal taste.  This shelter has a hand pump.  The water, although still slightly metallic in taste, is clear and without an odor.
Several of our friends are here tonight too.  We hadn't seen Sitting Bull for about the last five days; it's always nice to see him.  Hoops just arrived as I've been typing this entry.  She was off the trail for 5 days to register for school.  Moonshine and Chipmunk are here as well.  I don't believe they are a couple but they hike together.  Shananaguy and his nieces, Pluck and Sillyspilly, are here too.  It's always nice to see and catch up with friends out here.
My picture tonight is of Canapus Lake in Clarence Fahnestock State Park.  We stayed there last night.

During the day, we passed the ""Dover Oak"".  It is the largest tree on the Appalachian Trail.  It is impressive and easily six feet in diameter.
We also passed Nuclear Lake (my picture for today).  In 1972, there was a small explosion in a nuclear research center testing bomb grade plutonium and uranium near the lake.  The independent research lab denied any radioactive material was released but the government found that to be false.  It revoked the center's license and a massive cleanup took place in 1975.  Locals were still concerned for years afterwards (and some still are) but the government came back in 1995 and certified the area as clean.  The area is absolutely beautiful but camping and swimming is still not allowed.
This afternoon they were calling for rain and thunderstorms ae expected tonight.  So far we’ve been lucky and the rain has held off or missed us.  But they are calling for rain the next few days, too.  We will just have to wait and see.

It began to rain again soon after reaching our campsite and is still raining as I type this.  It is supposed to rain throughout the night and they are calling for two inches of rain tomorrow.  It sounds like it's going to be a wet day.
On a good note, we did cross into Connecticut this morning--my 10th state.  The trail in Connecticut is only about 51 miles long so we should hit Massachusetts in just a couple of days.
We also met a friend of Beaker's today at a road crossing who was doing Trail Magic.  He had fried chicken and lemonade--it was great!

Today started out at nearly 100 percent humidity again.  I made stops at two different streams just to cool down.  Copious amounts of cold water poured over your head does wonders.  My picture tonight is of one of these locations.
Tomorrow, the weather is supposed to be much better.  I'll be satisfied if the humidity is lower.  I have 15 miles to go to get to Salisbury, CT, where I plan to resupply and possibly take a “Zero”, or at least a “Nero”.  I can hardly wait to take a shower and put on some clean clothes.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569358,"I woke this morning to sunshine just starting to peek into the shelter.  What a beautiful sight after all the thunderstorms yesterday afternoon and all night.  The humidity was way down too.  It made for a beautiful day for hiking.  But, the trail was littered with newly fallen trees and branches.  Some of the trees were more than two feet across and had brought down smaller trees as they had fallen.  It's almost sad until you realize this is nature in action.  This is the way things are supposed to work out here. The open access to sunlight will allow other plants and trees to grow and the fallen trees will provide food and living spaces for other plants and animals for generations to come.
The hike today was officially 15.7 miles long (plus an additional 0.8 more to a hostel in Salisbury, Connecticut).  Today, I also went over 1,500 miles.  Not bad for finishing just around 2 pm 
Upon reaching the hostel, the first order of business is usually showers, followed closely by laundry.  Some hostels provide you with loaner clothes so you can wash everything you own.  Most times, this can get quite hilarious because absolutely nothing comes close to matching.  It becomes even funnier when we all traipse into local eating establishments and/or grocery stores dressed in our wild attire. 
Today, loaner clothing options were very limited and by the time my turn came around, there was nothing left.  So, I was forced to wear my least smelly clothes for a while longer.  Luckily, a hiker named “PaJohn” let me throw my every day shorts and shirt (and I really do mean ""every day"") in with his laundry.  By the time I got to wash my clothes, I was able to change the dirty clothes I was wearing for the clean ones...but unfortunately, not before our trip to town for ice cream and a mid-afternoon meal at the local grocery/deli.  Thru-hikers no longer smell each other but I'm sure the locals haven't lost their sense of smell.
Currently, I'm still on schedule to finish my hike by August 15, so I'm going to remain here tomorrow for a “Zero” day.  I still believe I need to take at least one day off a week for R&R, even if I will be bored most of the day. 
Right now, I think it's time to make one more trip to the ice cream shop and then maybe, head to dinner.  Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry, and enjoying an evening being clean.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Pine Swamp Brook Shelter

Actually, we spent the day zeroing in Salisbury, Connecticut.  It was nice to relax and rest my aching feet.  In all honesty, we normally only get to relax for about half the zero day.   The rest of our time is spent taking care of chores like resupplying and cleaning/repairing gear.  I've still got a few things I need to do before heading out again in the morning.
I've noticed I'm starting to tire faster now than I did just a month or two ago.  At about 15 miles into the day, I'm exhausted.  I thought it was just me, but I've talked with several other hikers the last few days, many of whom are much younger than I, and it appears we're all starting to feel it.  We all are thinking we're going to make it to Katahdin but we expect to really be dragging by the end.
Another thing we've noticed is that prices have gone up substantially the further north we travel.  My four-day resupply today cost me $60.  Down south, I believe, I could have purchased the exact same items for about half the cost.  Hostels and hotel rooms have also doubled in price but, in most cases, the quality has dropped.  I hope both these trends reverse themselves as we move further away from the big cities.
Tomorrow morning, we will leave Connecticut and enter Massachusetts.  Connecticut was beautiful, the hiking was great, and the people were extremely friendly.  But, it's always fun to enter another state and I'm looking forward to the Berkshires.

Connecticut was about 60 miles long and Massachusetts is about 90.  In less than a week, I will be in Vermont.  Vermont is often referred to as “Vermud” by AT hikers.  I was hoping this year would be an exception and it would be dry, but it looks like the looming tropical storm/hurricane may turn it to mud after all.
There were two tough climbs today:  Bear Mountain, Connecticut 's highest point and Mount Everett in Massachusetts.  But overall, it was a very nice hiking day.  We only hiked 12.7 miles but that was because we are only allowed to camp in designated sites in Massachusetts.  Continuing to the next shelter would have made it about a 28-mile day.  This was more than any of us wanted to do.
We planned to hike 19.6 miles tomorrow but, due to the tropical storm, there is an 80 percent chance of rain tomorrow and 100 percent chance on Saturday.  Depending on how bad it gets, we might have to take another look at our options.  If it’s too bad, we will come off the trail at a road crossing and hitchhike to the nearest town with a hotel.

The rain we were expecting today never materialized.  Oh, we got a few sprinkles, but it never got heavy enough to even put our pack covers on.  They are still calling for heavy rain tonight and tomorrow and I can hear thunder off in the distance, so I'm spending the night in a shelter.  I've never had a problem with my tent leaking but why press my luck and why pack and carry a wet tent when the shelter has available space.
Today, we learned from our phone app (Guthooks) there were sodas available at an antique store just a few hundred feet east from where the trail crossed the road.  We did a quick detour but the place was closed.  At the same crossing, AWOL's Guide said there were vending machines at a repair shop just 2/10s of a mile west.  No luck there either, the place was out of business. Now, I can usually do without a soda, and before the hike, I hadn't had a soda in more than 6 months.  But, on the trail, there is nothing worse than expecting a town treat and then not getting one.  We sucked it up and sadly moved on but at the very next road crossing    Trail Magic!  A 2015 thru-hiker named ""Belch"" and his buddy were passing out watermelon, snacks, candy, and SODA!  I made a pig out of myself and gratefully accepted two:  a Pepsi and a Mountain Dew!  They tasted incredible and were just what I was craving/needing to help push me up and over the next big hill.  Thanks guys!

During our hike, we stopped off to meet the Cookie Lady.  She has been handing out cookies to hikers for more than 30 years.  Not only did we get to meet her and have some cookies, we also got to meet her husband.  What a wonderful couple.  During blueberry season, they also let hikers pick blueberries from their U-Pick Berry farm.

After meeting the Cookie Lady, we ran into Trail Magic at the next road crossing.  Rob used to own hostel in the area but moved to Tennessee to escape the cold winter.  He comes back each summer to visit his sons and grandchildren and to provide Trail Magic to hikers.  We ran into him again at the hotel and he offered to give us a ride to an Italian restaurant he knew and liked.  We took him up in the offer...but this time we provided the magic and bought his dinner.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570122,"Interesting happenings today!  Last night Beaker and I stayed in a hotel in town.  Rob Bird, a trail angel, gave us a ride to dinner and then back to the hotel.  Upon our return, we learned that Squire and his sons, Stretch and Remix, had arrived, and were just two doors down from us.  Since we hadn't been able to do our laundry last night, Squire asked me to let him know in the morning when we were through with the washer so they could get their stuff in.
At about 7 am, I walked down to their room to let them know the washer free and Squire told me there was a family emergency and they were leaving the trail for a few days to drive back to Tennessee.  I told Beaker about the emergency and he decided to offer to be a second driver and take the opportunity to spend a few days with his wife.  He lives just a short distance from Squire's family.  
My wife and son will be in the area visiting family (and me) for a week starting on the 1st.  I plan to take a couple of “Zero” days to visit them.  I also plan to see a doctor about a sore on my right foot that refuses to heal and keeps getting infected.  I’ve been using a topical antibiotic and soaking it in Epsom Salt on my zero days but it continues to plague me.  Hopefully, a prescription strength oral antibiotic will help.  I also plan on slack packing while she is here.
Right now, I plan to hike some slightly shorter days in the hope of aiding my foot to heal.  That, and the Zeros I intend to take, should allow Beaker to catch up to me within two or three weeks after coming back.  We hope to climb Katahdin together.
So, by about 10:30 this morning, I was back on the trail by myself.  This, and the fact that most of my day was uphill, made for a short day.  I only managed about 14.5 miles.  I considered pressing on but a rain shower started just as I arrived at a nearby shelter which quickly helped me to change my mind.
I also saw my third bear today.  Unlike the first two, this one was in no hurry to leave the trail.  It was also much bigger (and closer) than the other two, and it actually took a couple of steps towards me.  I yelled as loud as I could, ""Get out of here, bear!"" and it turned and slowly lumbered off the trail.  I stood there until it was out of sight and then moved along a little quicker than I had before.  I'm not sure what it would have done if I hadn't yelled, or continued towards it...or ran.  Who knew yelling would work!  Okay, I think I've now seen enough bears for this trip.
Tomorrow, I will enter Vermont but first I need to get over this mountain.  I'm currently about 2/3 of the way up but it will be another 3 1/2 miles before I reach the top.
Several people have sent me emails asking about my pack.  I'm carrying an Osprey 58.  My profile states I'm using an REI pack but I switched at the last moment and never updated the information.  I'm sorry for any confusion it caused.  I carried the Osprey during my two warm-up hikes but felt it was two small when I added my winter gear.  So, I bought the REI pack because it was larger, figuring I would change back to the Osprey when I got rid of my winter gear.  But the REI pack also weighed a pound more and I finally decided I just needed to either get rid of some stuff or make it all fit in the lighter pack.  I ended up doing both.  Overall, I've been pretty satisfied with the Osprey.  It wasn't the lightest pack available, or the cheapest, or the most comfortable, or the most durable.  But when you consider all these factors together, it was, in my opinion, the all-around best.  Probably, because of this, it is also the most common pack on the AT.  At this point in my hike, the wear and tear is beginning to show.  Mine, and most of the others I have seen, including Beaker's, has multiple holes in the mesh on the back and the sides.  I've replaced three buckles on mine, but Beaker hasn't had to replace any yet.  My shoulder straps won't remain tight and I have to adjust them at least a dozen times each day, but Beaker's never slip.  I believe my pack will last the rest of the hike but I won’t be able to use it on another long hike.  I might buy the same pack again but would also like to consider other options.
My picture tonight is just a pretty little pond on the trail...right before I saw the bear.

The actual hike today was pretty nice even if it was a lot of uphill.  There was quite a bit of thunder and lightning going on as I hiked to my shelter tonight but I arrived right before the rain started to fall.  The rain has now stopped but the temperature is down in the upper 40s.  My quilt is warm enough so it should be a nice night for sleeping.

For some reason, I misread my guide book and thought Bennington was right off the trail, it's actually more than 5 miles away.  After my resupply the other day, and skipping dinner last night, I still have food and I'm meeting my wife on Saturday morning near Manchester Center, VT.  That leaves me with a 19.3-mile hike tomorrow (and a 1,500-ft climb at the end of the day), or a 9-mile day tomorrow with a 21-mile day the next day.  The closer shelter has been having bear problems, so I think tomorrow will be the 19-mile day.
Today's hike went pretty well.  The trail started out very wet early this morning, but got better as the day progressed. Hopefully, tomorrow will be even better...if the rain holds off.

Tomorrow, will be a short day of about 11 miles.  My brother in-law will meet me near Manchester Center, VT, and I will head back to their home about 45 minutes away.  My wife is flying in tomorrow night and I plan to “Zero” for a couple of days.  Saturday, I will see a doctor about my foot (I think I just need some oral antibiotics) and I need to get new shoes again.
I thought my shoes broke down too fast but after checking my guide book, I got just over 500 miles of use out of them.  I'm not sure yet what I will replace them with, but they will need to have plenty of toe space.
It's still raining and the shelter is packed tonight.  It's supposed to sleep 12 but I think we have about 20 in here.  We also have a number of tents set up around the shelter.  Much of the crowd consists of a youth church group.  The ages appear to be between 12 and 16.  All the girls are in the shelter loft and the boys are out in the tents in the rain.  They are currently trying to cook their dinner and making more noise than I think I've heard in a shelter since Georgia.  I don't mind it, although my opinion may change once I go to bed.  This is their first night out and right now, their excitement and enthusiasm is fun to watch.

I decided to go with Keens again, mostly because of the wide toe box.  This time, I went with a mid-height boot.  I know it's slightly heavier than the shoe version, but I felt the added ankle support would be good to have in the “Whites.  The only thing I don't like about them is the fact they are waterproof.  I've found waterproof shoes just take too long to dry out once they finally get wet inside...and they all eventually get wet.
Tomorrow morning, my wife will drop me back on the trail for a day of slack packing.  I'm planning on doing about 20 miles to the road crossing where she will pick me up for the evening. To me, hiking for the day, carrying almost nothing more than water and my lunch, followed by a shower, and a night in a bed sounds simply incredible.  And, I'm going to get to do it for the next five days!  Due to the location of road crossings, I might not get 20 miles each day but I hope to average 15+.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570822,"My wife dropped me off at the trail head after breakfast this morning and I hiked 17.6 miles for the day.  One of the problems I've found with slack packing is I tend to have an almost ""vacation-like"" attitude.  Without the pack, the hike becomes less like a job to be accomplished and much more enjoyable.  I tend to slow down and enjoy the sights more, I take more time for lunch, and I take more pictures yesterday than I normally do in a week.  In the end, I don't finish any more miles than I typically do when wearing my pack, but, it's a lot less wear and tear on the body.
Another issue I've found with slack packing is your hiking day is limited by the location of road crossings.  For example, my day tomorrow can either be 6 miles or 24 miles.  There is nowhere in between to meet/be picked up.  This time it works for me because I have a local geocaching event I want to attend in the morning over in New York so I won't hit the trail before about noon, or later, anyway.  But sometimes, it can cause a really long or short hiking day.
Today's hike was very nice.  The terrain is beginning to change.  The hills are getting taller again and there are more and better views.  The forest is changing too.  There are more fir and evergreens and less hardwoods.  Most of the streams are clear again and not stained with tannins.  There are more ferns and moss, and where poison ivy and Virginia Creeper appeared to be the primary ground cover just a few days ago, they are almost non-existent now.  Beaver ponds are becoming more common.  My picture for today is just a pretty view from one of my hike’s high points.
Oh, one more issue regarding slack packing.  My wife and I some difficulty meeting at the end of the day.  Even with coordinates, and a GPS, it's not always easy to coordinate the pickup location and phone reception tends to be very poor away from the towns.  I recommend future hikers plan carefully and, when possible, visit both the drop-off point and pick-up location prior to the hike.
After my hike, I showered, put on clean clothes, and had a very nice dinner with my family at a local brew pub...a great end for a long hiking day! Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry in my hotel room.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","East of Manchester Center, VT

My son decided to hike with me today, but it was after 1 pm before we got back to the hotel and changed into our hiking clothes, and after 2 by the time we reached the trail head.  I knew I was only going to be able to do a short section hike today so I jumped forwards about 30 miles and did about a 6-mile section with a road crossing at each end.  Tomorrow, I will go back and finish half of what I bypassed, then finish the other half on Thursday.  I know it seems confusing but it works with my time constraints and family being here.

Today's hike took me over the top of Killington Mountain.  The climb up and down on the trail wasn't too bad.  There is a shelter about 2/10 of a mile from the peak.  The blue trail leading from the shelter to the top of Killington was steep.  It wasn't a big deal on the way up, but while I was up there a sudden storm with hard rain and strong winds came through.  I'm guessing the temperature dropped at least 20 degrees in just a couple of minute.  Being caught without my rain gear didn't help and the 30-40 mph wind gusts certainly didn't make it any easier.  I considered just waiting out the storm in the lodge but because of how steep the mountain was, I really wanted to be back down near the shelter before everything got too wet and slippery.  Of course, the rain and wind was pretty much gone by the time I scrambled back down to the trail.
The rest of the hike was very nice.  By the time I met my wife back at the parking lot, the sun was back out.  I'm hoping tomorrow's weather is at least as nice as today's but they say there is a 50% chance of rain all day.
I also passed the ""500 miles to Katahdin"" sign today.  With the other miles I covered today, and the ones I hiked with my son, I should have about 480 or so left to go. 
The terrain for the next two days doesn't look too bad.  I'm hoping to be knock out a large number of miles in the coming days because I know I will slow down considerably once I enter the White Mountains.  I want to stay on schedule to finish before August 15th if possible.

It was hard leaving my wife and son this morning.  The first couple of days after they leave is always hard.  This time, I won't see them again until I'm done with my hike, about 6 weeks from now.  I'll just try to hike a couple of long days to keep my mind off their leaving.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571932,"I woke up at the hotel this morning in N. Woodstock to pouring rain.  The forecast was calling for more rain for the next few days, so there was no way we could just zero and wait it out.  We made our way across the street to the local deli and picked up sandwiches for lunch.  Then we headed back to the hotel for a big breakfast of bacon, eggs, potatoes, French toast, juice, and coffee.

Our ride arrived at 8:00 am as promised and we were on the trail by 8:30 am.  We were only able to hike 11.5 miles by 5 pm but this included reaching the top of at least three mountains...mostly in the rain.
Tomorrow, we are hoping for better weather with better views and hoping to complete at least 14 miles.  I know it doesn't seem like a lot of miles but the climbs up and down are grueling.  Please don't misunderstand me; it's tough, but I'm still enjoying the challenge.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572237,"Today, we managed to complete 17.5 miles on the trail.  It was incredible and we got some beautiful pictures but also spent about half the day hiking in the rain.
We originally planned to hike about 14 miles to Ethan Pond Campsite but when we arrived at about 3 pm, we realized several things:  1.  We weren't done for the day.  We felt we could continue further on and complete a few more miles.  2.  The shelter was going to be too crowded.  We were early enough to insure a slot but that left little option for those behind us.  We might be old and we might be slow, but we have one thing most of the younger hikers don't have...we have credit cards.  If we continued another three more miles, we would come to a road crossing with two parks with cabins to the left and a hostel to the right.  3.  The extra three miles today would be three less miles tomorrow we would have to hike to the top of Mt Washington, giving us more time and options if there was no room in the hut.  Three less miles can be very important when they are calling for bad weather on a mountain top with the highest sustained wind speed ever recorded in the US and where it has been known to snow every month of the year.  So, we continued hiking with the hope of getting a cabin or a bunk in the hostel but because everything had already been reserved, we camped out in the rain in a park.
Today, I realized two major things:  It can and I can.  It can continue to rain that hard or even harder for hours, even days.  It can continue to go up long after I thought it would stop. It can get muddier.  It can get steeper.  It can get colder or hotter.  Bugs can get worse; humidity can get worse, rocks and/or roots can get worse, etc.  But, I can too!  I can continue climbing.  I can go further!  I can tolerate more bugs, heat, cold, humidity.  I can do this!  I will do this.  345 miles left!  It's nothing but another thing to get through.  And, if I can do this, so can you!  I'm just an average guy.  I have done nothing that the average person can't do.  You just have to do it about 170 days in a row.  If I can...you can too!

I'm just glad we were inside tonight.  The wind is howling outside to the extent that I can feel the building shake slightly with each gust.  Tomorrow morning, unless the weather is dangerously bad, we will hike for approximately one hour to the peak of Mt Washington.  Mt Washington has the distinction of holding the record of the highest recorded sustained air speed in the United States of over 300 MPH.  It held the world record until a few years ago when a hurricane in Australia exceeded it.  Sudden weather changes and wind speeds over 100 MPH are not uncommon here and over the years, more than 25 people have lost their lives on the mountain.
Today, we only completed about 10 miles of the trail but it was all uphill.  Some of it was very steep, slick with rain, and we were in a thick fog so we went very slowly.  As the day progressed, the sun began to peek through the clouds and for about four hours, it was gorgeous out.  My photo tonight was taken near the summit of Mt Eisenhower.  As the afternoon began to wane, and we neared Lake of the Clouds Hut, the fog rolled back in and visibility dropped to about 100 feet.  We were glad to be here.
We only have a few more days in the White Mountains.  Without a doubt, it has been the most spectacular portion of my hike so far.  Someday, I hope to come back and visit it again.

As difficult as the last few days have been, and tomorrow promises to be just as bad, I think the Whites have been my favorite part of my hike so far.  Of course, we've been very lucky; even with the rain, we've had views for at least part of every day and always at the summit of each mountain.
Tomorrow morning, we need to make a very small, two-day resupply before heading out for the day.  And, since breakfast came with the room, we will have breakfast too.  We should be on the trail by 9 am and we have a 13-mile day planned.  Camping is only (legally) allowed at the shelters so Imp shelter will be our stopping point.
Tonight, I washed my clothes in the shower and have them strung on a line in my room.  Hopefully, they will be dry in the morning, but if not...it won't be the first time I've worn them wet.

Tomorrow afternoon, we reach Gorham and will resupply.  All of us are have scheduled a Zero day there but Gorham is only about 8 miles from the shelter where we are staying tonight.  We will wait to decide if we are going to continue on after the Nero, or stay the extra day and Zero.  Right now, my feet are telling me to stay.
We were racing a thunderstorm all day today.  Just around the time we started thinking we might reach the shelter without getting wet, it started to storm.  Most of my life, I have counted the time between seeing lightening and hearing thunder.  Today, before we reached the shelter, the time between the two was less than a second.  It was close.  We also got soaked...again.  This means I will be wearing wet clothes in the morning.
Today, we passed through most of the area known as the Wildcats.  My photo is of a small lake we saw in the area.  These lakes are scattered throughout the Whites and each one of them is beautiful and unique.

Even the hike down this morning was tough.  After last night's rain, the trail was a running stream in many locations and a lake in others.  The rocks were wet and slippery and I believe each of us fell at least once.  The actual streams we're swollen rivers and crossing was difficult at best.  Pa John went in the water past his knees at one point and bruised his knee.  I slipped at the same crossing but fell onto a large boulder instead of going in the water.  Pa John also fell last night at the shelter when he was getting water and bruised his other knee.  He spent at least a couple hours today with an ice pack on one knee or the other.
When we reached the road, we came across Satellite and her daughter Moon Shadow doing Trail Magic.  What a wonderful family.  We enjoyed a few minutes talking with them and they gave me my first ever Moxie, a local soft drink that is either loved or hated, depending on who you ask...kind of the way people feel about black licorice.  The flavor is hard to describe...but I was able to finish it and I may even have another, some day.
We continued on hiking to the White Mountain Lodge and Hostel.  Both Pa John and I had a package sent here.  We checked, showered, changed into loaner clothes, got our food in the laundry, and then caught a ride to an AYCE Chinese Restaurant for some heavy-duty eating.  We were going to hitch-hike back to the hostel when a truck pulled over and Honey Badger jumps out.  I had met him earlier during my hike for a day or two before he rocketed ahead of me.  I met him again around the middle of the trip when he returned to the trail from a wedding.  He is/was super-tired often after completing 25-30 miles a day.  He summited Mt Katahdin two days ago with his girlfriend.  They were driving home when they saw us walking down the road.  It was wonderful to see him again and he gave us a ride back to the hostel.
Today, I also crossed the 300-mile mark!  Less than 300 miles left to go!  The next few weeks promise to be exciting, and both happy and sad at the same time.  It has been an incredible adventure but it is almost time to go home.

We ate breakfast at the lodge, lunch at a local well-known restaurant, and had dinner delivered to the lodge.  I also managed to squeeze in a nap and a couple of New Hampshire craft beers.
Today, I ran into ""Norm"" again.  I hadn't seen him since he slowed down enough in the Shenandoahs to hike with Beaker and me for the day.  A very nice guy; I'm glad I ran into him again.  We might also be joined by a lady that goes by the name ""Styles"".  Her hiking partner had to leave the trail due to the passing of a close friend.  It would be nice to add another member to the group.  Now, if Beaker, Hoops and Sitting Bull could catch up, we could all finish this together.
Overall, I'm well-rested and ready to reach my 14th and final state in a day or two.  That is, other than still having sore little toes.  I've come to the conclusion they will continue to plague me until well after my hike is over.   I can live with it if I have to, but I’d really rather not.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572656,"I'm in Maine!  Tonight, I'm staying at Carlos Col Shelter.  Our original plan was only to go 12 miles today.  We’d heard horror stories about how rough the trail was from SOBOs and knew from our guide books it was going to be uphill most of the way, so we were going to keep it short.  But, we reached the first shelter before 2 pm and decided to continue on.  The SOBOs were right, it was brutal, but we made it here and we're settled in for the night.
Tomorrow, we do the Mahoosuc Notch and Mahoosuc Arm.  The notch is touted as the most hated or the most fun mile on the trail.  It is a mile of boulders you cross through, over, under, and around.  I've been told that there are places where the pack must come off and be drug through because it is so tight and there are areas where the ice never melts from year to year.  I don't know if I should be excited or worried.  The arm is just another big climb after the notch and it is supposed to be brutal.  Overall, I've been told to expect to take 5 or more hours to get through both.
I learned today that I made a mistake in last night's post.  Norm, the hiker I mentioned seeing at the hostel....well, I didn't catch up to him.  He is doing a yo-yo.  He already summited Katahdin and is headed back south.  Not only did he pass me, but he is now more than 500 miles ahead of me.  Man, that guy is fast!

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572771,"Today, we made our way through the Mahoosuc Notch and up the Mahoosuc Arm.  The notch is a mile-long boulder filled ravine.  The boulders range in size from as small as a refrigerator to as large as a house.  You must make your way through the ravine by climbing over, working your way around, crawling under, and/or working your way between boulders.  There is still ice and snow in the low spots and the cold air coming up felt like entering an airconditioned building on a hot day.  The approximate one mile took us an hour and forty-five minutes to complete.  AWOL’s guide book calls it the hardest or most liked mile on the trail.  I'm not sure it's the hardest (though it's plenty tough), but it was one of my favorite.  I jumped across gaps and hung from/swung across drops that usually would have terrified me.  I had a great time.

On the other hand, the Mahoosuc Arm wore me out.  It's only about a 1,500-foot climb, and it's steep, but it shouldn't have exhausted me like it did.  I'm glad it's over.  It seems that some days, even the simple things are really hard; and on other days, nothing can slow you down.  After the notch today, I felt like I had hit a wall.  Every step hurt and it was about all I could do to keep climbing.
So, even though today was only about 10 miles long...it was a tough 10 miles.  The next few days promise to be just about as hard, but we can do it!

I've also been talking and listening to the other north bound hikers.  Even the young people are starting to talk about how tired they are and how little strength they have left.  I feel the same way, but can't help but feel a little better when I hear people less than half my age complain about the same physical ailments.  We also share one other more thing…we know that minus an injury, we are going to complete this hike.
Today, I had the great fortune to meet Hydro.  Hydro was providing Trail Magic at a road intersection and greeted me by name as I came out of the woods.  He has been following me on Trail Journals.  I appreciated the Trail Magic but really enjoyed meeting him.  He even had some Sam Adams in his cooler...I won't tell you what time it was but I'm sure it must have been 5 o'clock somewhere.  He’s a really nice guy who knows a lot about the local area, to include the towns, roads, trails and mountains.  He ended up being the high point of today; not only for me, but the other thru-hikers I talked to throughout the day as well. 
Recently, I posted a picture of myself at the state line sign.  Several people have emailed and asked what I have on my feet.  Those are a very popular brand of thin Lycra Gators called ""Dirty Girl Gators"".  They come in all kinds of colors and designs.  My first pair was plain black but I tore one and honestly, the pair I bought was the most conservative ones the outfitters at Delaware Water Gap carried.  It was either go without, buy these, or buy a rainbow-colored pair.  I kind of like them.  They weigh almost nothing and do a great job of keeping rocks and debris out of my shoes.
Pa John, Spass, and I are all exhausted but feel like we can't afford the time to take another zero day until we're closer to the “100 Mile Wilderness”.  We've decided to slack pack tomorrow and possibly even the next day too.  Our mileage will be shorter than usual but at least we will still be making progress and leaving the heavy packs behind should allow us some ability to rest and recover.
Today, I also ran into Captain, Floater, and Picasso again.  These are three of my favorite hikers out here who I thought were so far ahead of me.  I didn’t think I would see them again.  The trail surprises me every day.  I'm glad I ran into them.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572901,"Yeah!  I saw my first moose today!  She was about 50 feet off the trail just watching us as we passed by.  I can't understand how they can effortlessly walk through woods so thick that a human would have a difficult time getting through.  I tried to get a picture but all I got was a blur.  As silly as it sounds, I really wanted to see a bear, a porcupine, and a moose on this hike.  As of today, I'm three for three!

Today is also my last day of month #5.  It's hard to believe I've been hiking that long.  Right now, I have approximately 250 miles left to go and about 25 days before I need to be through.  I shouldn't have a problem finishing on time and should even be able to take a zero day before entering the 100 Mile Wilderness.
Today, Pa John, Spass, and I slack packed a 10-mile section.  Tomorrow, we are going to slack pack again for an 11-mile section.  I know I've said it in the past, but this gives us an opportunity to rest and recover while still completing miles.  We made two big climbs today without the wear and tear we typically feel at the end of day...and it gives our feet a chance to recover too.
Our bodies are not the only things wearing out.  I'm currently in my 4th pair of shoes and they are coming apart at the soles.  I will have to replace them before entering the 100 Mile Wilderness.  My pack has also seen better days. The mesh is coming apart on both sides and the back.  I'm going to need to do some mending before I can carry anything in the right-side mesh pouch again.  My clothes are not in much better condition and I have changed out most of it more than once on the trip.  It's now almost a race to see what holds out the longest--Me or my gear? 
It's also interesting to see the difference between the NOBOs and the SOBOs.  The SOBOs have only been on the trail for about a month.  Their gear looks like it just came off the showroom floor.  They look fresh, young, even clean.  One north bound hiker described it as ""They still have excess fat-energy to burn”.  We're the old veteran soldiers, we have seen the elephant (or the moose, in my case).  They're the ""FN New Guys"".  Many of them haven't even received their trail name yet.  Over time, and miles, they will come to look like us.
Something I've come to realize about the AT is that it's not about the hike.  The PCT might be about the hike.  The AT is about the people:  those who hike it and those connected to it in so many other ways.  The people who run the hostels and shuttles, the Trail Angels, the volunteers who maintain the trail, even the people in the small towns on and near the trail.  They all make the trail what it is.  They are what makes it unique and what makes it so great.
Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry at the Pine Ellis Hostel in Andover, Maine.  I've been on the trail for approximately 150 days.   I'm tired and I miss my family and my friends, but I'm still excited to see what comes tomorrow.  I'm a lucky man to have had this opportunity.  I hope you get your chance to live your adventure too.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Pine Ellis Hostel

The weather today couldn't have been better.  The temperature was perfect and the only clouds in the sky were the big white, puffy, shaving cream, looking ones, way up high that just made everything look even more picturesque.

Tonight, I'm staying at the Stratton Motel and Hostel.  I resupplied for the next day three days at the local grocery store but the choices were really limited.  If you're considering this hike, this might be a place you would want to mail a package.
Speaking of mailed packages.  I've emailed 12 packages to myself along the trail.  If I were to do it again, I would probably increase it to about 14 including one here.  Much of my research recommended I limit the number of packages I send myself because I might get tired of what I send and want something else.  While this might be true for some people, I found it much easier having a large variety of meals available to me than trying to put together meals from the options found in most small-town grocery and dollar stores.  While the variety of my lunches and breakfasts have been limited (there really aren't that many choices for either), my dinners have been varied enough that I rarely have the same meal twice in a week.
Another advantage of mailing yourself meals is you can spread the cost over a much longer period.  Most dehydrated meals, such as Mountain House have at least a 20-year shelf life and tuna packages, oatmeal, and other store items last at least a year or two.  I could find much of my food for less than half the price you typically pay at outfitters or small-town grocery stores.  I do recommend you mail your packages when possible to locations other than the post offices.  Their hours are very limited and you might end up waiting until Monday to get your box.  Most hostels and outfitters along the trail will hold your packages for up to a month for free or almost free.

From here until we climb Katahdin, the trail will be much flatter than it has been since the very beginning of this hike.  If the weather holds, and the mud, rocks, and roots aren't too bad, we should be able to pick up our pace some.  I need to average about 15 miles a day to finish when I need to.  And, I still want to do a zero in Monson before heading into the 100-mile wilderness.

Around noon, we decided to stop at a small sandy beach on Carry Pond for lunch.  But, before eating, we decided a swim was in order.  The water was 5 feet deep and clear enough to see my feet easily and it was cold enough to almost take my breath away when I first got in.  It was wonderfully refreshing.  We ended up spending almost an hour there and was joined by several others before moving on.
Even with our extended break, we still arrived at our campsite by 4 pm.  We hiked 17.7 miles today.  I'm currently camped about 50 feet from the water's edge and can hear the Loons as the sun slowly sets.  
Tomorrow's weather is supposed to be just like today's...meaning perfect for hiking.  About 3/10s of a mile from my campsite is a hunting and fishing camp.  The owner opens the lodge to thru-hikers for breakfast for a small fee.  At 7 am, I will be setting down to eggs, sausage, pancakes, coffee, and juice.  It sounds much better than what I had planned... another day of Pop-Tarts.  As it stands now, by the end of my hike, I could be diagnosed with PTSD, “Pop-Tart Stress Disorder”!  Eggs and pancakes sound heavenly.
After breakfast, we plan to continue on to the Kennebec River.  This is the only spot on the entire trail where ""shoe-leather"" is not the mode of transportation.  Due to dangerous conditions, a canoe with a white blaze painted on its bottom will transport us across the river.  I'm looking forward to traveling a few yards of my journey while sitting on my butt!
After the river crossing, I plan to stop at a hostel near Caratunk but not for the night.  I'm hoping we’ll arrive before noon just for a quick resupply (and I hear their sandwiches and shakes are great too) and then on for another 14.7 miles.
But that's tomorrow.  Tonight, I intend to lay here in my tent and listen to the Loons while I drift off to sleep.  I'm safe, warm, and dry.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Little Bigelow Lean-To

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573726,"136.5 miles to go!Tonight, I'm camped near the Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to after an 18.7 mile day.  It was a very full and interesting day.
We started this morning at 7 am by walking the 0.3 miles from our campsite to Tim Harrison's Hunting and Fishing Camp where we enjoyed his ""Patriotic Pancakes"" (pancakes with red raspberries, blueberries, or white apples cooked right in), eggs, sausages, juice, and coffee.  After breakfast we made our way down the trail about 4 miles to the Kennebec River where we waited in line for more than an hour to catch our canoe ride across the water.  This is the only section of the entire AT that you do not walk.  There is even a white blaze painted on the bottom of the canoe making it part of the official AT route.
After our canoe ride we continued on to the Caratunk Hostel where we completed our resupply and had lunch consisting of pulled pork sandwiches and chocolate shake.  The food was delicious and in less than an hour we were back on the trail.  It was after 1 pm and we had more than 14 miles to go for the day. 
A couple of hours later, we arrived at the top of the mountain where fresh, ripe, blueberries were growing all around us.  We couldn't help ourselves so we stopped to eat several handfuls of the blueberries and rest a bit.  After a few mins, we met a local who was hiking in the area.  The day was beautiful and we could see for miles and he was kind enough to point out Katahdin to us.  I was barely visible almost 100 miles off in the distance...our first look at the mountain.
After the local left us and we were preparing to continue on, several of our young friends caught up to us and we were able to point out our destination to them.  Emotions were thick, fist bumps were passed around, and most of them made phone calls to friends and family to tell them they had ""seen the mountain.""  It was fun to watch!
We finally got back on the trail and arrived at our campsite around 7:30 pm.  It's now long after Hiker’s Midnight.  I've had my dinner and I'm in my tent for the night.  I'm excited about tomorrow but for tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Pierce Pond Lean-To

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573754,"117.8 miles remaining!
Our plan today was to only hike 13 miles.  This would leave us with 11 miles to hike to Monson tomorrow.  We’ve been pretty tired and 24 miles today would just be too much for us right now.  But when we arrived at our shelter, it was only 2:15 and too early to quit for the day.  We knew they were calling for afternoon thunderstorms but the sky was still clear.  As we were discussing our options, a SOBO mentioned we could catch a shuttle from a different road crossing and parking lot only 5 miles away.  We quickly decided to make a run for it.  We were less than a mile from our destination when the thunderstorm rolled in and soaked us.  We ended up completing 18.7 miles today.
We were able to contact the hostel from the parking lot and the shuttle arrived within 10 mins.  We quickly checked in, showered, and made a quick trip to the local gas station/pizza place for dinner.  It was surprisingly good...of course, the cold beer certainly didn't hurt either.
Tomorrow, we plan to catch a ride back out to where we were picked up and hike the remaining 4 miles to the original pick-up location.  Then, we will return to the hostel for a Nero and a Zero!  Honestly, I'm looking forward to the break before we enter the 100 Mile Wilderness.  I'm also looking forward to my new shoes that should be here waiting for me.

Tomorrow, I have a 4-mile hike.  We actually jumped off the trail yesterday at an earlier road crossing than most people do in the attempt to miss a thunderstorm.  We we're still caught in the storm, but not nearly to the extent we would have been.  Today was supposed to be our Nero into town and tomorrow was supposed to our Zero but we decided to switch them around.
Monson has turned out to be a nice place to stop.  Shaw's is a nice hostel but we also visited the Lakeshore House (for lunch and dinner) and it was nice too. The entire town is very hiker-friendly.  If you ever stop by here, make sure to stop at ""Pete's Place"" for a shake.

Tomorrow, we're back on the trail again.  The plan is to hike the for 15 miles of the 100 Mile Wilderness.  We're hoping to make it through in 6 days, well, at least we're only carrying six days-worth of food.  I guess if it takes longer than that, we will get a little hungry.  Or, maybe, there will be more berries to eat.
After our short hike today, I managed to squeeze in a short three or so hour nap.  I don't think it will affect my sleep tonight though because I just can't seem to get enough sleep.  After I'm through with the hike, I'm hoping to do nothing but rest for at least a week.

So far, the “100 Mile Wilderness"" looks like the rest of the trail.  We crossed a couple of small gravel and/or dirt roads today and crossed one railroad track.  We even came across two young women with their 3- and 5-year olds day hiking.  But, I suspect we will see less and less evidence of civilization as we proceed.
We are planning on taking 6 days to get through the wilderness.  I believe we could do it in 5 but our flights home aren't until the 11th and 12th so there is no need to arrive any earlier.

It was a rough day!  Maine is beautiful but so far it has not been easy.  Tomorrow promises to be repeat of today... hopefully with a couple of exceptions.  Today, rain made the roots and the rocks very slick and although I was trying hard to be careful, I fell three times.  I twisted my knee on the first fall.  It's sore but I think it will be fine.  On the second fall, I landed on my hands.  My palms are bruised but again, but I think I'll be fine.  The third time I fell, I jammed my index finger on my left hand.  It's currently very stiff and sore, making it difficult to grasp my hiking pole.  I'll have to see how it is in the morning.  Typically, for me a jammed finger lasts about 3-4 days.  I should be okay by the time I climb Katahdin.
Today, we hiked 15.2 miles.  It doesn't sound like much but the terrain was tough.  Even though we only climbed one hill in excess of 2,000 ft, we must have climbed at least 5 more that were at least 500 ft climbs.  Also, at least two of these climbs were rock scrambles requiring both hands and feet to ascend and/or descend. Tomorrow, we have one climb in excess of 3,000 ft.
It seems that all us NOBOs are wearing down.  In my little group, Pa John is having knee problems, Spass is limping from problems with his feet, and my toes continue to plague me. 
Our equipment is wearing out just about as fast as we are.  Pa John's collapsible cup came apart this morning, Spass is concerned about the number of holes in his shirt and tent, and my pack is slowly coming apart.  I also had to replace my shoes for the fifth time while I was in Monson.  I might have made it to the end with the pair I had but several of the lugs on the soles were torn away and the entire sole was starting to detach on the right shoe.
We had rain again today but this time we didn't make it to the campsite before it started.  Everything got a little wet during set up too but I managed to dry most of it before settling in for the night.  We are camping near a stream crossing and since my clothes were wet anyway, I washed them (and me too) in the stream.  The water is a little cold but it felt great to get the grime off. 
Tonight, I'm settled in my tent.  The rain has stopped for now and hopefully (but I don't expect it) we’ve seen the last of it.  I'm safe, warm, and dry.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Long Pond Stream Lean-To

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574336,"67.8 miles to go. 
After getting rained on last night trying to get to my campsite, the rest of the evening turned out nice.  We camped on the south side of a river and, after getting water for dinner and today, I took some time to wash out my clothes and then lay them on a flat rock in the sun to dry.  After washing up, I carried my wet clothes back to camp and hung them on a line I stretched between two trees.  At about 10 pm, I checked on my clothes and they were almost dry so I brought them into my tent where they finished drying overnight. 
It didn't rain anymore overnight, so I was able to tear down and pack everything while it was dry this morning.  We forded the river and began almost an entire day of uphill climbing.  To make it even tougher on us, the wind began to blow and it began raining again soon after we crossed the river. The wind and rain continued through most of the day and increased in intensity until we reached the top of White Cap Mountain.  At the peak, around 3,650 feet, the wind was strong enough to make walking difficult.  It was cold and blowing rain. 
This is considered an excellent location to view Mount Katahdin which is about 60 miles away, but there was no view today so we didn't tarry long.  Just a few minutes after passing over the top, the rain stopped, the wind died down, and the sun popped out from behind the clouds.  It was a very welcome sight.
We arrived at out out shelter for the night at around 5 pm after hiking a total of 16.4 miles today.  According to everyone we've talked to, the trail should be easier tomorrow and the rain is supposed to be gone for at least a day.  We are going to try to go at least 19 miles.
Tonight, I'm safe, warm, and dry in my tent near East Branch Lean-to.  The mosquitoes outside are fierce but they can't reach me in here.  The wind is softly blowing and the temperature feels to be in the low 50s.  It should be perfect sleeping weather.  Goodnight from the Appalachian Trail.","Stealth Camp Site in the 100 Mile WIlderness

I spoke too soon in last night's post.  Just minutes after I hit the send button on my post, it started to rain.  I don't think it ever stopped during the entire night.  Sometimes it came down gently.  Other times, it came down torrentially, accompanied by blindingly bright flashes of lightning followed way to closely by tremendous rips of thunder.  If there had been any place to go, I would have gone there quickly.  But like humans have done since the dawn of mankind, all I could do was huddle there and pray to the “Sky Gods” to have mercy on us.

Last night was also only the second time on the entire hike where my tent flooded.  I woke up this morning with a puddle in my tent and the edge of my sleeping bag wet...not good at all with a down sleeping bag.  Pa John sleeps in a hammock, so he was fine, but Spass ended up flooded as well.  We spent more than an hour and a half drying gear in the sun on a gravel road this morning.  As I type, I can't help but notice that my sleeping bag still feels damp.
Even with drying the gear, we were still able to knock out 19.5 miles today.  The (more) level terrain has certainly been an improvement.  Tomorrow should be more of the same although there is one 1,000 foot climb.  At this point, it's just another hurdle to get over...or as we say, ""nothing but a thing.”

My hand is still sore from my fall a couple of days ago but it is already much better than it was.  I think it will be fine by the time we reach Katahdin.  We are currently only 48.3 miles away from the summit and the end of our hike.  We can almost see the finish line but we're not taking any chances so we are trying to be as careful as possible.

We had several nice views of the mountain today from the trail.  My photo tonight is of one of those views.  Even though we were only 16 miles away as a crow flies, there was still nearly 40 miles of trail to hike.  Today, we managed to knock off another 18.2 miles.  Tomorrow, we plan to do 15 more.  From what we've been repeatedly told, much of it will be through ankle deep mud and hordes of mosquitoes (Gotta save the best till last, I always say).
The 15 miles we hike tomorrow will bring us to Abol Bridge and out of the 100 Mile Wilderness.  We plan on spending the night at either of the two campgrounds located there and eating in the restaurant.  I can hardly wait!  A cold beer and anything ""not dehydrated"" sounds great about now and the next ""Moose Tracks"" I hope to see will be the flavor of my ice cream.

Wednesday, we plan to hike 9.9 miles to The Birches Lean-to and Campsite.  Once there, we will camp if we can get one of the 12 available spots or hitch a ride into Millinocket for the night.  If we have to go to town, we will catch a ride back to the park early Thursday morning (around 6 am) to make our climb.  There is supposedly a limited number of people they allow to make the climb each day and it can take 10 hours or more to complete, so being there early is a must.

Pa John's wife and my wife, Christine, are both arriving the afternoon/evening of the 9th.  Luckily for us, they both already have hotel rooms and rental cars reserved.  Staying the night in town would not be a bad thing but might slow us down on our start time on Thursday morning.  Staying in the campground guarantees an early start.
Once we finish our descent on Thursday, we plan to drive straight to Portland.  Spass needs to pick up a rental car and drive to Boston to catch his flight back to Seattle on the evening of the 11th.  Christine and I will spend the 11th in Portland and fly back to San Antonio on the morning of the 12th.  Before leaving this beautiful state, I'm really hoping to have a Maine Lobster and a local craft beer!

The 100 Mile Wilderness was an interesting place.  Although we crossed several dirt and gravel roads, I didn't see a single vehicle.  On the other hand, I heard aircraft almost constantly and saw one float plane taking off on a lake.  So, even though there aren’t any towns or places to stop (with the exception of White House Landing), civilization is almost always within hearing distance.  It was a really good feeling to come out of the wilderness on the other side.
I ate a bunch of wild blueberries over the past few days.  They were delicious and everywhere.  We even started dropping a handful of them in our water bottles for ""Blueberry Infused Water"".  Fancy, huh?
Funny thing, we've met quite a few SOBOs over the last few days.  Almost without exception, they warn us about how bad the trail in front of us was going to be.  The roots were thick, the mud was deep, the mosquitoes were fierce, etc.  However, it never seemed as bad as they proclaimed it would be.  It took me a little bit to realize they were only a week or less into their hikes and I have more than 160 days out here.  The mud is the mud, the roots, rocks, and mosquitoes are just more of the same...I'm used to it.  As we say now, ""Nothing but another thing"".  I'm sure I sounded just like them back in February and early March when I was just starting out.

Today, we hiked the 10 miles from Abol Bridge to The Birches Campground.  It is recommended at this time of year that you begin your climb before 11 am.  We might have been able to do it today but that would have made a 20+ mile day and we would have been late starting the climb.  It is safer if we wait and we don't want to hurry this last day of our 2,200-mile hike.  Tomorrow morning, at about 6 am, we will start the 5.2 mile climb to the top.  We’ve been told that it takes most people between six and eight hours to make the climb.  The weather is supposed to be partly cloudy tomorrow with a 40% chance of rain.  If we get lucky and the rain holds off, I don't think we’ll have any problem completing the climb and descending in that amount of time.
We were lucky and got camping spaces at The Birches Campground tonight.  There are only 12 slots and if they had already been taken we would have been forced to camp outside the park and find a way back early in the morning.  Although we had worked out a couple of contingency backup plans, this is by far the best way it could have worked out for us.
My picture tonight is of several of us sitting around our campfire discussing our plans for tomorrow and our experiences on the trail.  Tonight and tomorrow will probably be the last time I will see most of these people and I have grown to know and like many of them very much over the last few months.  I wish Beaker, Sitting Bull, Hoops, Ramsey Bolton, Ringer, and were with us but that is the nature of the trail and they will summit in the next few days.  I wish them the best of luck and I hope they reach the top in beautiful clear weather.

1st Sgt,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574781,"It's over.  It's going to take a while to sink in.  2190.3 official miles hiked.  Pa John, Spass, House, and I started our climb at 6 am.  Sitting around us were others we had hiked with numerous times over the previous months, to include Matador and his wife Heather, Two-Hearted, Dirty Harry, Lotus, Young Giraffe, MOM, and his daughter Leech, and many others.  Although there was some soft talking going on, the crowd was more subdued than most mornings but the feeling of excitement in the air was almost palpable.  We separated slightly on the way up, as if we were each involved in our own vigil.  It was an undertaking we had to complete alone. 

The first two and a half miles were easy.  Actually, it seemed to me to be some of the easiest on the entire trail.  In the past, the trail has never been what I expected.  It has always been harder or easier than I’d imagined, depending on what I’d read or heard about each particular section.  I never got the ""Virginia Blues""; Pennsylvania was even rockier than I could have imagined; Vermont wasn't the muddy quagmire I’d been told to expect, and so on…. 
Then, I climbed out of the trees and into the boulders.  This section seems almost straight up.  Keep in mind, I'm afraid of heights.  There were often hundred feet (or more) precipices all around me.  Sometimes, I felt like I was hanging only from my fingertips or toes, and several times I thought the wind would take me over the edge.  I thought of turning back even then.  At one point, I came across a young lady huddled down in a crack in the rock.  It was easy to tell she was too scared to make the next move.  Somehow, I coaxed her over the boulder and we moved on, both of us more confident in our ability to finish the climb.
It was a great relief when I finally climbed over the final edge and crawled out onto the tablelands.  The tablelands were like something out of a sci-fi movie and much larger than I had expected them to be.  It was possibly, as much as another mile to the Katahdan sign signifying the end of the trail.  Touching the sign at the end of the trail was an emotional event.  Resting in a crevice in the rocks, out of the wind, thinking about the last few months and my trip back home almost had me weeping.
The trip down was easier than the way up.  We took the Abol Trail and although it was steep, it wasn't nearly as bad as the way up.  It took about two hours to reach the parking lot.  My wife was waiting for me there.
In your life, you can lose almost everything.  Your home, cars, money, even friends, and family can all disappear.  But, no one can take away your experiences.  I will miss the raucous laughter of the crows in the first hour of the morning, the drumming of the grouse, the caterwauling of the barred owl defending its territory in the middle of the night, the yodeling of the loons on the ponds of Maine, the taste of dew-fresh blueberries, and spring water so cold it makes your teeth hurt, even the skittering noise of the mice as they search for food in the shelter at night.  But, I'll always have the memories.  They cannot be taken from me.
But now it's time to go home.  Thank you to everyone I met on the trail.  You are what makes the trail great.  And, thank you to everyone who followed my hike.  I could not have done this without you.  Your daily emails encouraged me to go on.  But most of all, thank you to my wife and family.  For putting up with my crazy ideas and having faith in me.  I love you all.
