Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560614,"Some hikes don't go as planed, even rarer are the ones that don't as planed in a good way. A lot like Recovery, where I learnt to deal with life on life's terms so it is with hiking. Originally planed was an overnight hike with myself and three friends. Our goal was to do the entire Linville Gorge trail, running 11 miles one way then back. One person got sick and wasn't able to join and the other two were planning to stay out in hammocks. Luckily for me I decided to bring a tent instead of the tarp ill carry on the trail just in case someone needed more comfort at night.    Linville Gorge is referred to ask the Grand Canyon of the South. with its river splitting two high peaks, with breath taking over looks all along the trails that lead to another trail or the river. We had planed on picking up a trail map at the ranger station but it was closed due to the peak season starting in May thus that's when they'll have people there. being young and foolish we memorized the map in our minds, or so we thought. We began on the Pine Grove trail (I believe at least) and went down the mile until it met the Linville Gorge trail. we followed a trail down to the river and knowing part of the trail we were in search of was down by the river figured we had found it. After a bit of following the river down we realized we were not on the actual trail. We stopped to take in the beauty of the river cutting the gorge and turned around went back to the trail fork and started again.    We did the same thing a second time taking a trail that led down to the river and turned around after dawning our rain gear for what would be an hours hard rain. We once again turned around and went back to the trail to further complain in a joking way about how the AT has spoiled me with its wonderful white blazes for marking as this place had none we had seen at all yet. turned out to only be one official marking the whole trail we saw. after deciding that when met with an option for this trail going down was not the correct choice at all. This rule served us well the rest of our outing.    We hiked about 6 miles after this point until we got to a fork called Babble tower and decided to set up our camp there and then slack pack to an over look and to get water for the next day. We covered 11 miles this day but not the 11 we had planed. The up side being we saw things that most hikers didn't see and were never truly lost. I was able to show off the ability of the Jetboil cooking system. Its amazing, its the one piece of gear I use around the house the most as it boils water quicker than the stove and is less clean up since I can eat right out of the thing I cooked in without odd looks unlike when I attempt to do that with any other device I have for cooking. Its great for a single person like me that isn't so much into the cooking and eating thing for fun. we wrapped up our night or so I thought around 9. I stayed up to write and look at the stars. I finally crawled into my tent around 10, I was awoken around 11:08 but who's counting to guests joining me in my tent because hammocks were not warm enough for a night in April.    The next morning brought a sunrise that took time to climb over the mountain tops, but well worth it. It was also Easter Sunday. Which for a Christian is a reminder that the tomb is empty and that the word impossible isn't a word for those of us that believe. It was also the end of Lent and I was able to partake in coffee once again, after having a couple of cups and the color slowly returning to the world. We were off to the hustle and bustle of packing for our much shorter hike out of the park. After bringing extra gear along to try and out things and see what might be of use and what isn't I feel good in saying that Ill never carry extra weight for the fun of it again.Song of the Day would be 7 bridges road written by the great Steve Young (not the quarterback) and performed by the Eagles.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564130,"I left home this morning heading for Trents Grocery in Bland to meet a couple of hikers that stayed in Hillsville over Easter weekend. They had actually visited my home church but I wasn't there myself. One of the Hikers Jam actually had an article saved on his phone about me and saved it in hopes of meeting me up north. He wasn't even aware that he was visiting in my home church, so I figured I should try to meet up with them. Luckily they were near my neck of the woods I was able to figure out where they would be on my next day off to meet them and the rest of their hiker friends/family. I hiked north with them from Trents 6 miles down and turned around in order to get back to Galax in time to celebrate my four year anniversary of getting clean and joining NA (narcotics anonymous) I left home about 9 AM planning to hang out at the store until they arrived around noon but to my surprise Jam was the first person I saw when I walked in the door. He was also waiting for his group, he had left the trail to stay in a hostile the night before due to stomach issues. We sat down and talked for the couple of hours while we waited and talked to the steady flow of other hikers coming. We talked about how people could know we love Jesus without having to say it all the time, he shared with me he was reading Crazy Love By Francis Chan and talked about a few other things. He had mentioned he was a fairly new Believer and I shared my personal Testimony with him and we talked about the simple truth that we would be known as His by the love we show.About this time a big group of hikers came thru, including the folks we were waiting on! They went inside ordered up some food, some got resupply packages and some even had new boots mailed to them. After everyone enjoyed a lunch not in the woods full of grease they started returning to the trail. I was tagging along for a section, one of the hikers with us was named Pudge. She was the other hiker to visit my church and she was having some foot issues at this point due to carrying a heavy pack. Everyone discussed doing a shake down of her gear when they got to Pearisburg, but for the day I offered to carry her gear if she would carry my day pack with a coat and water. She eagerly agreed.This hike was one of the more enjoyable days I had spent in the woods to date, learning, laughing, and enjoying the trail community in full blast. I went to the trail that day with no plan and learnt so much. Some of the info I will use, most I will not. I listened to what they had to share and heard about why they had came here and how they prepared. I am looking forward to cross paths with them again in the northern end of the trail. The group I was with had 5 plus me. Engine, Caboose, Jam, Molasses, and Pudge. We discussed everything from local history to geology to Jesus. Their trail legs were in full force as well and we knocked out 6 miles in about 2 hours and for fun I was going try and make it back to the car in 4 hours total covering 12 miles in that span. It was just a silly challenge brought on in due part to a friend of mine who has started trail running, so I thought a good/fun challenge would be to just move a little faster than normal. As I am typing this it doesn't sound as fun as I remember. After I arrived back at my car I returned to Trents to eat a greasy meal that id finally felt like I had earned.A few days later I received a message from Pudge she was needing a ride to Salem to borrow a car to return home for a funeral, I offered a ride up there as a form of trail magic knowing the day will come soon where I need someone to help me. She has returned to the trail and I have enjoyed keeping up with their adventures via facebook.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564135,"Today I am in the woods with Shortstop (Dave our second Chaplin) We had planed a two nighter out but when I arrived in Knoxville I was met with the news that the park was closed due to 80 mph winds so we decided to just make it a one night hike. Me and Shortstop headed out the next morning to Sugarloaf visitor center in the park via Gatlinburg and was met with reports from other hikers of the rangers coming to their camp grounds and making them leave without packing up camp. One man gave a report that as they were leaving that a lady was heading toward her car when at that moment a tree fell on it. So while we were waiting to see if they would open the road that runs thru the park to where we wanted to go on Friday we were told of these stories. We waited about an hour before the decision was made to take the three hour drive around the park to the North Carolina side. The storm was much calmer on that side and it was a beautiful day. We started our hike on route to camp ground 59 in the park. This was to be my first field test of the tarp I plan to carry along the trail in case I cant make it to a shelter or one is full and I don't want to go on for that evening. Shortstop was surprise at how well it and I held up thru the night, around 4 the wind picked up and rain came in for a while. This was a good final run thru before I head out. I have a few odds and ends to add to my pack and a couple of things I can take out to keep my weight at near 30 with food and water. We hit our sleeping bags around 7:30 pm and woke up at 7:30 AM both agreeing we could have slept longer but we had also been in our bags so long that we had to move. So we packed up camp.We arrived back at the car just before noon, left to head back to my car at the Sugarloaf center and then go back to Knoxville. Lucky for us the road was open so our three hour drive was cut down to what should have been an hour and a half, but the Smokies had one card left to play. This one was in the form of an early May snow storm. As we drove up to the high points of the park Clingmons Dome and the likes the temps began to drop and snow started to fall. nearly three inches fell that day but we were on the road before they closed it back off so we were aloud to pass thru. Weather like this left me longing and remembering Late January with its calm days with sun and shine and brisk nights. I was once again reminded that the Mountains win again. Its alright to make plans but don't plan the outcome. This was a great hike were lots of information was exchanged.Song of the DayRun around Blues Traveler","

Somehow I could barely get to work back home 10 minutes late, yet I got to the airport 3 hours early. The flight to JFK was uneventful; I talked to a guy beside me from New York City. He pointed out the famous horse track as we were landing, something I would have overlooked on my own. Then I made it to my other flight, fell asleep before take-off and woke up 30 minutes out. I met Steven at the airport, and we went to eat Chinese and then to Dick's Sporting Goods to get supplies. At this moment I am in his guest room.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571462,"Today was scheduled to be the first hike, but it rained an inch and a half in Brownsville, and even more on the trail. I slept in, and had a very restful day. I sat down and planned my first flood drop in the wilderness and marked out my planned stays through the wilderness. I am ready to have my phone off and with no service. I say that as it rings. I miss Apple; my trail phone is an Android. I did show Steven how to space while texting on his phone. I figured it was a small pay-back for all he is doing for me. We talked a lot today, mainly about planning, and we decided to have communion on the trail  - on the mountain, to be exact. He even allowed me to assist in blessing the elements. This is a big first and I will not forget it. After that, I walked around town. It was the first time I wished I had worn trail runners so I could have took a jog. This evening Steven's church had a pot luck and had me speak. An older congregation, but still fun nonetheless. We talked a lot about the connected nature of this church. Three AM will come early.Song: I'm Going Hungry - Temple of the Dog","Brownsville

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571467,"Today I climbed Mt Katahdin. Me and Steven started out leaving his place at 4:30 AM. The first surprise was that it wasn't far off from day light at that hour. We drove an hour to the park, and waited to get in and then we started. My pace was slow at first walking with Steven, but he encouraged me to go ahead. Katahdin with this weather isn't the place to make new friends. Below the tree line it was a pretty day. Above it was a rock climb that leads you up to the tables which today meant high winds. As I was starting the last leg of my summit, a storm blew in. What started off as rain soon turned to sleet. Happy first day of summer! The winds picked up. My plans to take in a view from Maine's highest point and to read a note from Michael Snow while eating a Snickers had to be canceled due to the fact I couldn't open my eyes. On the way down with the wind helping push me this time, I made my descent. It was dangerous with the wet rocks and I constantly had to remind myself to slow down. How I didn't suffer more than a few dozen trips and falls I'm taking as a sign that God does want me out here. I met one man who started last year, hurt himself on the climb, and is now starting again. Another fellow was limping coming down, refused help and said his thru hike is done the same day it began. To have made this climb is an honor some dream of their whole lives and some the chance just falls in their laps. For me, I believe as long as I see this as an opportunity and not a duty, the hike can go on. I'm looking forward to easy hiking tomorrow and my first night camping. Tomorrow is when the connections will start to form. Today was a hello and a first bump. May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing views.

Today's hike was a ten mile section out of Baxter Park to a bridge, then 3 miles extra to the shelter I plan to stay. I was with a fellow I met today named Heath, and we hiked about 5 miles together. People are starting to roll into the shelter now around 4:30 PM. We have a fire going and I have extra water for anyone that would want any. One thing I remembered while gathering wood is you just have to go a few feet farther than the last hiker. Luckily, most hikers are lazy and don't wander too far from camp after it is established. Tonight I will be camping with a fellow who lost his chance at a dream job with the Environmental Protection Agency, a former thru hiker, and a guy from the Netherlands. It looks like dinner is around the corner.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571478,"Last night was my first night camping. Three of us stayed in the Herd Shelter. The first night is always the worst restless sleep. I was up and out by 6 AM after I caught Lance (name given by the bike tattoo on his leg). After slowing down to talk to him and hike a bit, Heath caught us. We were all heading to Rainbow Stream. It was about 12 miles. We made it before lunch and beat the rain. Lance and Tim made it as well. The other 9 from last night were not so lucky. There wasn't much to do in the rain, so I took a nap, as did the rest of the group, so we will see how the night goes. We've now since had 4 new hikers stopped. A mad man came in at 6 PM trying to cover 25 more miles, and he was running low on food so I fed him while listening to his wisdom and stories. Gramps came in the direction we came; he's a section hiker. He also had lots to share, some good, some bad. Tomorrow I plan to do 15 miles to the white house and stay in that hostel for the night. I might change my mind and just do 8 mile. Either way, the day after I'll stop at the same place I have planned. The rain seems to have passed. A father and daughter thru hiker team coming North are from Knoxville and they had heard of Shortstop before, may have even met him on a previous section hike. Tomorrow will be a challenge with a climb and a distance, but the weather sounds better. We will see what it holds.Song of the Day: If I Needed You - Townes Van Zandt","100 Mile Wildnerness

We decided to push on an extra 7 miles past the shelter to the White House, which is a famous hostel in the 100 Mile Wilderness. I came to dry out and to stick with the group I've been hiking with. Tomorrow I plan to only go 6 miles to hold off the blisters. I have a few beginning to start due to the wet socks. Van, my German friend, fell in with us today. He went past our shelter last night a bit and some of his gear is now ruined. I'm currently letting him take photos of my guide book so he will have something on hand. There are four of us still together from our first night at a shelter. I assume they will pass me by tomorrow. I re-supply at Jo Mary Road on Monday.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571485,"Today has been the most enjoyable day to this point. I'm not sure if it was the All-You-Can-Eat pancakes to start the day or the magical phone call that sent out to Stephen (BJ) and was able to resupply a day early or the fact we shared communion. We left the White House about 9:00, planning to go to Antler Camp Ground, a small 5-mile due to the fact my resupply was scheduled for Monday, luckily a call went through. We pushed it up to 3, which was a miracle since it's a Sunday. He offered trail magic to 7 of us that stayed at White House and one extra person we met at the camp ground. Stephen was wonderful. He dropped the dime on me out here but I think everyone was putting pieces together, but it's led to great conversations. Heath said he'd heard of the Chaplaincy, and Zero (Tim) has talked about how he doesn't have much to do with church. Van, my German friend, had talked to me earlier today about soccer and poor guy is asking me questions about how to ask questions, terms to use like girl or woman. Today was the start of a lot of good beginnings. Earlier today we learned that back in the 30's and 40's you stayed in a bunk through the whole wilderness. We made it to Coperbrock. Heath and Zero have set here and talked to me for the past hour while I've been trying to write. Heath had lots of good questions and we all tried to plan tomorrow (that's always well-wasted time). Tonight is my first night under my tarp. It's on limited space, so not set up the best, with lots of bugs. Here goes nothing. It's getting dark and I'll close with the face that I've cut a day off my hike. I have way too much food now which is fun.Song of the Day - Honky Tonks and Taverns - Lillie Mae","White House

This sets us up for two 16 mile days and then 3 miles into Monson. Luckily I made it in time to get to a shelter. The camp site had 2 people in it but it has since filled out with ten in total. A man was here from Asheville with his dog. They are running low on food due to injury so I gave him some, a few tuna packs and a freeze-dried dinner. We talked about Woody Guthrie and he had a back guitar, so we sat down and picked a little. We have a Maine AT tour guide and the president. She said we could thank him for the steps, and we chose not to. I fell today, but not too bad, my knee is just a little scraped.  Someone offered me some pot, and I told them no thanks.

They were all long and hard. I was able to call home, text Evan, and even hear from Alan. I hiked from 6:30 AM to about 5:30 PM. The last hour was in rain and sleet, all to make it to the shelter that was full, but Heath was willing to tent and give me his spot. I hiked alone most of the day. I enjoyed it for about an hour, then it gets boring. There's some wonderful views, but one thing I've picked up is if I'm going to take it in I need to be at a complete stop. If I'm trying to do or think about anything other than my next step, I either get my feet wet (worst possible thing at this point) or I fall. Everyone is looking forward to Monson.

I was of the mindset that if the shelter was full I would do the extra 3 miles to town. We rolled in near 5:00 PM again (we, being me and Heath), and the place was packed. A boy's camp to the north and a girl's camp from Canada was in the shelter cooking their meals. The other two hikers here were clearly through with them taking up half the shelter. These thru hikers had a fire going, so it looked like it was my job to ask them to get out. They did slowly as their meal was finished. They even offered us some - the second instance of trail magic! The group is an all-girls camp from Canada that takes place in Maine for the summer. Their plan is to do the Wilderness and Katahdin in 17 days. They were amazed by my gear and how little my pack weighed. They even had me show them how water filters work. They had all kinds of questions and were looking at me like a rock star. Just like Foxtrotter said they would at White House. I'm happy to say my plan was to take the 100 Mile Wilderness and treat it as a decompression period to get over the hustle and stress of the last 6 months. It seems to have worked. My belly is empty, my pack is light, but my spirit is full. Today was a lot like yesterday. Same amount of time hiking, same distance, but my body feels better and I don't feel defeated today. We had four river fords today where we had to get up to our knees in water to get across and after last night's and today's rains they were swift and raging.

It was an uneventful 3 miles with one hill and not any major obstacles; as I was coming out of the woods, a car was dropping off a hiker that I had crossed paths with the day before. We were dropped off (Heath and I) around 8:30ish. I got to washing dishes, like my stove and other gear. Then I did laundry and got a shower. Zero, who had come in the night before, took us up to the barbecue place that we have heard so much about. I left full, and after that I started my town errands of going to the post office and store. I sent something to Alan, Lindsey, and sent my very sweet and meaningful letters my friends had sent me back home. I would've liked to have carried them with me, but didn't have want to risk ruining them. I wrote a few short letters in there while it rained. I also stopped by the ATC museum which just opened here in Monson. After I came back, I sat around talking to the different folks here about everything from Bob Dylan to Star Wars and even some hiking. I left after another shower to go get dinner from the gas station down the road. I came back got my supplies and have spent the evening talking with the owner of Shaws.  He's very interested with why I am out here. He also shared with me the history of ""the most famous hostel on the AT."" Breakfast is at 7 AM, and then it looks like rain to the next town, but I'll go back tomorrow for some more supplies. It's no more than three days and my pack doesn't seem lighter, but it and myself are dry. Everyone has a new spring in their step.

I woke up in a bed. It was nice to sleep in until 6:30 AM. I had a great breakfast. These hostels pride themselves on breakfast, it seems.

From Monson to the next town, I have three days supplies and plan to take all three days. I ran into a guy that was hiking for veterans and goes by COWG (Crazy Old White Guy) and spoke to him for a little bit about what we had going on and also spoke with a few more NoBos about Monson. I was the first to tonight's shelter. It looks like they're only be two of us in the shelter and two camping. We do have another Canadian summer camp within 20 yards, but the summer camp really doesn't bother thru hikers. The couple camping near the shelter are from the Knoxville area and we been talking some about all things. I also met an old man walking up a hill on today's hike who called me by my name (Matt). He remembered me from Brownsville. He was out checking the registry, which is amazing. He could barely walk at the church.

Today I woke up to light rain with the reminder from the weather forecast from town that I had an 80% chance of rain all day. With a 13 mile planned for today, I started out around 7 AM knowing that today holds two river fords. These will be the last two on the whole trail!! I'm told it's just a one-step climb to Moxie Bald. It was a rather uneventful day hiking. I met a few NoBoS, one by the name of Greeter that filmed me saying hello and was planning to add me to his YouTube channel. The fame must have went to my head, because the trail then humbled me with a very muddy and rocky section falling right after. I stopped at a lean-to for lunch before the climb, and met two people who hadn't left there from the night before, but planned to do the 4 miles to the next shelter. I arrived at the shelter I planned to stay in at three and was the first there. Then the two ladies from Canada came in shortly after, and then my friends from 4 miles back. We are currently eating together due to the rain that started a few minutes ago. I've had a good conversation with the lady that speaks English about hiking: where she's from how, how her and her friend met hiking 10 years ago, and we talked about churches in America a bit as well. I split my time in the shelter lining up my next few days and have a schedule I like. Maybe I'll stick to it. I'm waiting to see if my friends from last night roll in cold and wet.

Heath and I rolled out of camp late for us, around 7:30 AM. We had lots of rain last night, so that thing I said about no new fords...that was a lie. We had to ford two rivers today that could've been a rock if it hadn't rained so much. Zero caught up with us after taking three zeros at Shaws to get new gear. He hiked with us today until we got to the shelter we had planned to stay at, and then he went on to town. We came and set up camp and went down to the lake beach and saw people on their boats enjoying the Fourth of July weekend. After sitting there for a while, we came back in shortly after eight a Nobo rolled in. He was very upbeat, and remembered a lot of the trail and gave us good and bad reviews on places. He loved to talk gear and asked about my hiking plans. We talked for a while about his upbringing and Church and how every time he talk to his mother, she says she is praying for him daily and how knowing someone that believes in prayer is praying for him means a lot. We have another summer group camping at our site as well and an older couple section hiking.

Today was nothing like I planned. I planned to come into town after a 5-mile hike, get my resupply, grab lunch, and then hit the trail again. That didn't happen. My resupply wasn't here, so that derailed everything. I messaged Alan to tell him, then resupplied at a local store. By the time I had done that, a thunder storm had set in. I was not wanting to set up camp in the rain. But after getting back from a hiker feed, I was shuttled into Rangeley. While hanging around this town I talked with a section hiker named Dreamer and we spoke about the effects hikes have on our spirituality. He was a former thru hiker as well, and he has a blog about just that. I shared my story. He shared with me that on his hike he moved from a ""Candy Christian"" to someone with an actual relationship with Christ. He was moved to tears to hear someone like me was out here. I've read some of his blog tonight; it's wonderful. After him and his wife left for the night, a group of us were shuttled to Rangeley for a hiker feed. Then the guy feeding us was a hiker from 2014. This was his trail magic. He made ribs and pasta. He asked why I was out here then I asked if he was a friend of Bill W. He had 26 years of recovery. We read the Daily Reflection from AA and discussed it. After he had to go back to cleaning, I went and met Poncho, he was hiking with his wife Northbound. He is a retired service man and he started talking about how his whole look on life had changed and he was finally starting to see the importance of a spiritual connection. He and his wife had been talking about starting to attend church. I talked to him about how it has awakened me. We discussed everything for over an hour. He talked about his spiritual hurdles from his past. Pancho was very moved. We exchanged contact information and we will meet again. He said he was moved to see a Christian where he was and talking about their struggles.

I left town today around 10:30 AM, and I had an offer to slack pack over the first couple of miles out of town for ten dollars. I didn't have to to carry my full load over a couple of mountains and 7.5 miles. It came with a Gatoraid and pizza, so a pretty good option worth taking advantage of. It helps preserve energy an lessen the impact on a body. It was a good choice, as today was the most climbing I've had to do while on the trail. My ankle is also giving me a problem at the moment. It will determine if I go 8 or 16 miles tomorrow. Of the 8 of us that started together, today only 3 pushed to the lean-to for the night. We are joined by another hiker is from Georgia. Him and myself have spent the evening talking about how the trail was his answer to the question of what to do with his life after selling his business. He said he is searching for something and I know he will find it out here. We also shared stories about Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard. Earlier in the hike I ran into Dreamer again with his wife, Scooter. He shared with me the story of how he accepted Christ on his thru hike on March 7th, 2006 in the Smokies. I believe anytime you can get someone to share their faith story it's a wonderful thing. It's not only about what God has done for them, but it's also proclaiming what God is going to do. 
I crossed the 200 mile marker today! I said earlier that the weather has been great and I hope some good weather is being saved for the Whites...it started raining shortly after.

It was absolutely amazing and had 2.5 miles of walking above the tree line. It had the best views I've had so far. This morning I started out at 7:00 AM (a late start for me). I went very slow with my achilles feeling good until 9:30 AM, then it started hurting very badly. I actually had a few Nobos point out my limp. It was a very difficult day for me going 8 miles to the first lean-to. I decided to take a long hour lunch and take some Advil to help with the pain. I made a hot chocolate to make myself feel better. Wild Card came along and encouraged me. I had a hard, slow, painful morning. It gave me time to ask why we like to suffer alone. I was reminded that when we share our burdens and pains they become less. We climbed together and she hung at the peak and I went on after a bit. I ran into Poncho and Scooter and we talked again for a moment then went our way. I came back into camp at about 5:30 PM, shortly after a group going north came in. We've been talking about plant life and their experiences in Boy Scouts and with the church itself. I personally came here partly to meet people with knowledge, experiences, and hope from areas I have no knowledge or little, so I've enjoyed it.Song of the Day: I'm Yours - Jason Mraz","A lean-to across some big mountains

Today was planned near into Rangly. I came into rest my ankle. At this moment it feels okay. Rangly is known for being a hard hitch into town. It is a very tourist town with a year-round population of 1,000, but during the summer it has 9,000 folks in the town. After walking 3 miles trying to get service to call the the Farmhouse Inn, I gave up and turned around to go back to the Hiker Hut which is only 3 off the trail. Then the lady from the Farmhouse came and picked me up. After running errands around town this morning, I came back and found a bit of free time to chat with the owner. She remembered Short Stop from is hike and then we talked about how the ministry has progressed over the years. She blessed me with a free stay because of Short Stop and our work. 
Later that day she shuttled us to town for dinner and I talked with a hiker named Juicy Fruit. We had long distance running in common and he was a Virginia Tech graduate. We were able to share life stories. He listened to me talk about my journey into faith. Then he talked about how he has been pushing himself in mental and physical endurance feats, but something was missing, and I recommended he start with service to others. Then I talked about how that has lead me to this point. We came back after dinner and a group of us have been sitting down around the kitchen table talking about classic literature, something I gladly sit, listen, and learn from. I'm hoping to take it light tomorrow to test my ankle and get going again. Here's hoping.

Today started off great; I signed up for the 8:30, so I was able to wake up, eat, and read, which is completely different from life at home and on the trail for me. Most days I wake up and rush into something. I hiked 18 miles today alone, and a few people from the group I'm hiking with came back into the woods and I stayed to rest my ankle. It seems to have worked. Today I had no problems. The shuttle to the trail head was driven by the Farmhouse Inn's owner's son. He also remembered Short Stop as well. We talked bout how things have progressed in the ministry and also he had questions about how I was the first appointed pastor to the trail by us. I got to the trail at 8:45 and planned to get to my goal lean-to by 7 PM and the one between by 2 PM. But the trail was easy going and I got to both two hours earlier than expected. I got to the lean-to and two guys from Farmhouse were here along with Trasher (Heath) and Wildcard, and six other Nobos have just rolled in for the night.

I woke up this morning to pouring rain at 5 AM. Since no one in the lean-to showed signs of moving anytime soon, and the rain didn't show signs of stopping, I went back to bed. Someone finally decided to get up and start to get ready at 7:30 AM and everyone followed. About 8 people started heading out, and I left at 8:45 and the rain seemed to be tapering off. It only rained about another hour. I took my rain jacket off, then had to put it back on due to it being cold. Last night was the coolest night we've had so far. It woke me up a time or two. A cold front has moved in and I could see my breath when I got to camp today. The water has raised the creek to make for a surprise ford and since I was wet I just walked right through it. I ended up getting knee deep. After a long day of ups and downs with elevation changes of 2,000 feet plus a couple of times, I made it to the last climb up to tonight's lean-to. We were met by a summer camp fixing dinner. Rain seems to take the bounce out of thru hikes. It's a silent night at camp.

After looking over the options of getting a hitch into town to just turn around and go back or stay and dry out, I picked to stay and for once as luck would have it, it rained while I was in town as well. This is making me feel much better about my choice. I was able to get my to-do list knocked out (i.e., laundry, shower, and re-supply) and I grabbed lunch by 2, which is fairly good seeing as how getting to town seems to make hikers lazy. Nothing too crazy happens midday in town. But this evening, Mud Flap and Roadrunner made it in. They came off the trail at the road 4 miles behind me. Us three went to dinner and talked about our plans for New Hampshire. Mud Flap asked me questions about public speaking and how I started. He asked what a basic speech from me is likely about. My answer was I'm not real sure; for one, I normally don't listen to myself and two, I haven't done it long enough to have a style.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575009,"Day 27Today we picked the 9 AM shuttle out of town so we wouldn't have to rush to get out of town. It also gave me, Heath, and Mudflap a chance to get breakfast at a diner. Mudflap came in telling us he saw a moose. I laughed and Heath got angry in the funny way. He has been hoping to see one since I first met him. Not long after, it crossed the road in front of the window we were sitting by. We laughed at the fact we've hiked over 250 miles and then see one in town, through a window that could be confused as a living room TV. After that, we got our ride out to the trail. Heath talked me out of doing 14 miles to the next lean-to. I was planning to hit tonight based on the fact it charged 8 dollars to stay. So we did 8, and when we got here around 2 after trying to beat the rain, a tent was set up in the lean-to by a guy taking a zero in the woods today. After talking to him a bit, we started talking about recovery. He shared he once was a member of NA and we talked along those lines. A well-traveled man that self-described himself as a drifter. We had good conversation and it didn't stop at recovery. We also talked about the Grateful Dead a bit, and of course John Mayer. That all came from getting his review of Vermont. After a while he made mention that it was neat to meet someone in recovery who didn't have to change all their personal passions. This is a huge compliment to me. He also asked if any of the towns north had meetings. I answered no, but told himethat what ever town he finds himself in he can search for a meeting by googling ""NA Meeting Finder."" He had mentioned previously that he goes to the libraries to use the internet and he gave me reviews on ones I should visit along the trail since I told him I do the same back home. The rain just stopped pouring down. Tomorrow is a bid day; the guide book claims that tomorrow has either the hardest or funnest mile on the AT. My goal is to make it both.

In between was Mahoosuc Notch, and it's known as the hardest or most fun mile on the AT. For me it was just a blast. I got a little too into jumping over rocks to the point I started rock climbing...I ended up lost about 500 feet off the trail and no real obvious way to get back down. After some careful and plenty not-so-careful tricks to get back down to where the trail was, I lost a water bottle and a camp shoe but not my life. So that's a win. I was still able to get through it in an hour and a half, 50 minutes of it on the AT. I was still able to get to tonight's shelter ahead of the crowd. A group of Nobos have arrived since and Mudflap and Roadrunner have caught up. We are all sharing stories from our adventure days.

And what a day - I climbed a mountain...the last mountain in Maine. I fell off a bog board, and was in it up past my knees and somehow pulled my self out. Then shortly after changing to clothes that wouldn't have attracted Big Foot, I crossed into NH. One state down! I got to the next lean-to after Success Mountain and hanging out up there longer than I have on any peak to date, was met by yet another summer camp. They offered sliced turkey, and in exchange I talked to them about thru hiking and I even got to share with them why I love Jesus and what a Methodist is. I am a little sluggish after the past few days, but I have less than 10 miles until Gorham, NH. Alan has friends that are offering to house me. Here's to a new state and new friends.

Completely dry is impossible unless everything is perfect. But the mroning came and no problem came up that wasn't just mild discomfort. With 9.5 miles to town, me, Heath, and Wildcard left out at 7:30 and headed for Gorham. We made it there by lunch. Cindy and Chuck had planned to meet us there at 12. I called and pushed it back to 3 and ate at McDonald's. Every time we enter a town, we talk up one place to go and this time was McDonald's. We ran into W (my German friend), and he was taking a few zeros at the White House Inn. After catching up with him, us 3 started a hitch into Gorham. We were picked up by a guy driving an old RV. We talked to him a bit. He is from Israel and lived in NYC for 4 years, and now is touring America, going to every state and speaking about his home country and their technology industry. He was also filming his journey. After being dropped off, we ate and then ran our in-town errands. I stopped by a book store and got a book for the trail. It's called the Tao of Pooh. Yes, Winnie the Pooh. Cindy picked us up at 3 and took us to Wal-Mart for re-supply and I got new camping shoes since I lose one in the funnest mountain. She then took us to their home and extended an offer to let us zero here tomorrow. I know my body needs it. After we dried our gear, did laundry, and showered, they took us to town for dinner. Cindy and I talked about recovery and how her church can better reach out in that area. She just recently took part in some training on the subject. Since we got back from dinner, we all spent a few moments pointing out stars and planets using the Google Star application and taking in a part of nature we often miss on the trail.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575023,"Day 31Today was a zero day, thanks to the hospitality of new friends. With staying at Chuck and Cindy's, it gave me a chance to rest and relax away from complete madness that comes from hostels and the constant rush of hikers coming and going. No rush today at all, and I was able to make phone calls and read. My big adventure was going to the library where I mainly just wanted to read about baseball. On the way, Cindy took me by an outfitter and a hostel that is part of the Yellow Deli network. It is a communal living group that has Christian rooting. I've heard about them a lot from hikers on the trail and online. They are very nice popel with roots in the ""hippy"" movement style of the 60's. Their big thing is healing comes in groups. After they showed me the building they are still working on, it made me feel like a VIP on a back stage tour. I went and got on with original plans. Bad news: the Orioles might be selling at the deadline. I'm rested and ready to hit the trail. Chuck cooked burgers for us tonight and I answered questions about what I had to do to get my local pastors license. Wildcard and Heath were lost. Chuck and Cindy have offered to slack pack us to Pinkam Notch, which helps the others more than me since I'm re-supplying often through NH and not carrying a ton of food. But it does help me leave a few pounds behind and is a ride to get my next re-supply and a bed again in two nights. The way the shelters are in the Whites and re-supplying left me with a difficult few days if I didn't take up their offer since the town my stuff is in would be a 10-mile hitch after a hard 13-mile day hike.

I started at IMP campsite and was heading to Pinkum Notch to meet Chuck and Cindy for another night's stay with them. It was 13 miles on paper, and it started with climbing Carter Mountain, and it finished with going down Wildcat, with about seven peaks in between. Today it actually felt like I was in the Whites I've heard about, with more than 4,000 foot peaks, plenty of day hikers, and coming across the first of eight huts. I got to the hut around 12:30 and the caretaker had CCR playing. I hung around for about an hour talking with her and other hikers, mainly because it was nice to relax and partly because her playlist sounded better than what I had been singing in my head for days now. I talked with two day hikers who seemed to like hiking but didn't get out as much as they would like. They asked me about gear and why a person from a church was out here. They had questions about preparing for a thru hike and planning one as well. After leaving there, I started over Wildcat, with its four peaks, even though you only notice two. Peak D has a ski lift so it was crowded with people that rode up and took pictures and went back down after roaming the peak for a bit, from old couples to small families. The downhill drop from there was steep and long but along the way, I saw some friends slack packing going north through this section. W (my German friend) who will be starting south again from the same point as me and Housekeeping and his dog Bullet. Besides talking and catching up with them all, the day hikers enjoyed chatting about everything you could think of. After getting to the visitors center, I sat and waited for my ride and was able to give some extra food away to other hikers. I now have 21 miles of the Whites in the bag.

On the way up, I met a couple, Garmin and Tortus. After talking for a moment, she said ""Oh wow, you are the AT Chaplain."" She is a very active Methodist in the New York conference and a section hiker. After a photo was taken, I went on. I did the first mountain in the 13 mile range and stopped in to see the hut at the bottom then figure out what to do next. I made it in time to get a work for stay. Not knowing what I'd have to do for a free night of left overs and sleeping on the floor, I was told to wait. While outside talking with others, a lady my age or younger got here going north. After a moment she yelled, ""Trigger!!!"" It was Pudge that I day hiked with in Virginia and gave a ride to as a form of trail magic. I was hoping to run into her and the rest of her friends I'd hiked with. She is a day ahead of them. I figured it'd be impossible to run into any of them. While we were talking, someone from the hut came and asked if we'd be willing to talk about our hikes as our work. I told them I didn't like speaking in public but I would. So after dinner a group of about 12 gathered to listen to us tell facts and stories from the trail.

It helps to know that Chet's is donation for stay so that helps with staying here for three nights in a row. I've helped him do things around the house and gave him cash as well.

I started my hike alone and halfway up the mountain I met a day hiker named Bob. He is planning a thru hike after retirement. We talked about gear and hiking plans, different ways to hike and all that. We went our ways on the top of the mountain after exchanging e-mails and he asked that I let him know when I'm in the Massachusetts area. This is a good example of how hiking brings us all together. I made my way down the mountain to the Hiker's Welcome Hostel to get my re-supply. I met back up with Housekeeping who skipped the Whites because Bullet (his dog) couldn't do the big climbs. There are six hikers here and we've spent the evening discussing hiking and trading information on the terrain ahead. I was able to finalize details about my preaching gig in Vermont coming up.

At about 9:30 AM, a man in a suit came walking up and I said, ""I'm buying what he's selling."" He came in and talked for a bit and I took him up on an invite to church. I was one of 7 people, and they let me talk about the ministry for a bit. It was wonderful to be in fellowship, and the pastor invited me to lunch but I declined so I could hike. I hit the trail at 1:00 PM, and planned to do 15 miles and did, and got to camp around 6:30 PM. I stopped right after the campsite before my goal, and there was a man doing trail magic. He sets up daily and makes omelets. I sat there and talked to him for about 30 minutes and listened to the race over the radio. Now I'm in camp with three Nobos.

With only one other person going south the trail was quiet again today, in part because the tourist hiking spots are behind us.

I hiked 18 miles to my goal shelter for the day, leaving 11 miles left in New Hampshire. I wasn't pinched for time today, so I took 3 or 4 breaks to just sit around and take it all in. I got to the shelter around 4:30 PM and was met by 2 ladies and their dog who they had out on its first hike.

They stopped to ask me questions about wild life I've seen and I had just taken a picture of a small deer I had seen a few minutes before. It made their day. Shortly after, I exited the woods to do a mile plus town walk that had me cross at the Connecticut river and into Vermont. I'm staying with a Trail Angel who's name is Jennie; she's a priest who opens her house up for hikers and her church if need be. She drove me to an AA club where I was hoping to get in a meeting , and from there a man drove me to an NA meeting about 10 minutes away. A lady spoke and then I got a ride back from another lady.

After hiking a bit, Nobos started warning me of a wasp nest that someone had hit and got stung. I had no problem with them. A few miles down, I came up to someone dragging along. It was Chef, he was the guy who got stung. He was moving slow, so I decided to walk with him the rest of the day to make sure he was okay. After the next road walk, we stopped at a house where trail angels house hikers and they make lunch daily.

Chef and I were in no hurry, so we left out at about 9:30 AM, my latest start in the woods. I hike to Route 12 where there is a place called On the Edge Farm and had lunch there. While there, a small shower passed over, and we stayed dry. We then started our last 6 miles and got to the shelter before to get water to carry up. While there, a thunder storm rolled in and soaked the woods again, but again we stayed dry. After waiting the storm out, we made the last 2.5 miles to the look out. There are about 12 Nobos here, and its the liveliest the trail has been in the woods. Everyone is watching the sunset from a tower and laughs are being shared.

While talking with a Nobo, he said he had met and shared a shelter with Wildcat in the Smokies. He was excited to say he met us both. After that break, I kept on hoping to meet Shirley around 12:00 PM, since she had said she had an afternoon meeting. About a mile before I was there, I was stopped by 2 Nobos, and we had an orange together and talked. They asked me why I said no thanks to their offer to smoke, and I spoke about recovery and the work with the church.

When I got to the store to pick it up after rushing to make sure I was there before it closed at 6, I was handed a pink slip saying I had it waiting at the post office. I owed money on it since it was bounced from the Stratton Inn, a service which I believed was free. So now I'm staying at a new hostel called Jen's Place. It's a nice house she lets hikers stay at. I'm sitting at a desk in a room I wish was my own with posters and records of jazz artists on the wall. She's gone and I'm here alone. Crazy, huh? I'm 150 yards from the post office so I hope to be on the trail before 9:00 AM.

She said she was pushing 90 and gave me a ride to town then saw me again walking main street and asked if I was okay. She was full of life; after grabbing an early dinner, I went to a bookstore only because it is known as being voted the best in America. The books looked more like books you'd place on the shelf and tell friends stories of hunting them down, a lot like what we do with deer and fish back home. After being overwhelmed in there, I left for a gas station to buy snacks to hold me over tonight. While waiting for Jen to pick me up, I started talking to a guy working there who moved here from Alabama to get away from his ""crazy wife he got hitched to on Xanax."" I told him I know that feeling. I don't think I lied in that moment. Then we talked a bit about how changing your location isn't always a cure for everything, but how it can be a stepping stone.

With no real plans, I wondered around. I went to NBC studios and got a ticket to go to the top at night to see the city, something I missed out on last year. I also got tickets to a play off Broadway. It was an adaptation of Shakespeare with improv thrown in. It didn't' start until 7:30, though, so I had time. I walked to Hell's Kitchen to get affordable food (not related to the TV show) and sat in a bar and talked to the owner and two ladies about hiking. They offered to buy me a beer so that gave me a chance to talk about recovery. One lady was an avid bike rider and had actually been to Hillsville to ride her bike on the Blue Ridge Parkway. After that, I went to the show and laughed until I cried. It was nice to relax. I truly love this city, but for now, I'm ready for the trail.

I left the lobby with a cup of coffee and headed to Grand Central. I dropped the coffee off with a man on the corner. The train ride wasn't as fun as going in. When I got to my transfer, I was told the tracks were closed, so I was put on a bus. After getting back to Pawling, I grabbed lunch at a deli that has been on the food network. The sandwich was great. Then I did a road walk back to the trail. I stopped in at a landscaping business to grab my resupply and then had a phone interview with Crystal that lasted an hour. I always feel like I'm talking in circles, but she's good at what she does and gets a story out of my ramblings somehow. I then started a short 4 mile day to a shelter and set up camp early. The water source was dry so I walked about a mile back to the road then asked a house owner for water. I then carried enough for me and a couple people back up. Shortly after, an outdoors group from Yale came in. It looks like I'll be sharing the shelter with 10 others. It's a 6 person shelter. After a bit, 3 section hikers came in with only a tarp and hammock between them with rain coming I gave one person my tarp to use and gave them some water as well. Then a Sobo came in I met a while back called BBQ. First one in over a week. Camp is quiet even with this many people, but I've been talking to everyone between them rushing to set up camp. I talked to one gril about her upbringing in the SBC and how she just can't relate to that now. And I spoke with the section hikers about the spiritual aspect of the trail and life. Today was a day I felt down and like I wasn't doing much right but it has turned out to be a great evening.

We talked some more while waiting for a rain band to pass over. Last night they had asked me to bless their meal, so I did. I also prayed over their hike. The trail was very quiet today. Besides seeing another Yale group, I may have only seen three other hikers. I did meet a nice lady that her and her husband maintain this section as she was out for her evening walk. We talked for a bit and she shared that they also keep up and pretty much saved the shelter I'm at tonight. Today I stopped by my first on-trail deli in New York for lunch and relaxed out back for a bit. Then I did the last 5 miles in. The shelter I'm at used to be a cabin, now it's known as the RHC shelter. Some people get pizza delivered here and its almost like being in a hostel without a shower.

Today I could really feel the difference with my feet and legs. I was moving quicker than I have since I've been out here. I made it to a baseball field that has a pavilion for hikers. I got here and started talking to a section hiker who was here. He has a stutter and we talked about how he didn't ever feel at home any where but the trail. He asked a lot about church things and Jesus. We even had a short prayer together. Then three other hikers came in and we've been talking about the trail and how its nice to finally be with other Sobos. We've joked about how with all the delis, it doesn't feel like much more than day hiking. Tomorrow we go over Bear Mountain, then the lowest point on the trail.

I should mention that my buddy from last night, Snickers, when I got up he had his Bible out and asked me a few questions from Luke which he'd been reading last night. After getting to Bear Mountain bridge, I entered the lowest point on the AT. It was a walk through a zoo. After getting through the state park and resupplying at the inn, I met up with BBQ. He was slacking and we hiked for a bit, then he went on to catch his ride. I got to a shelter about 18 miles from where I started.

I got a late start and did the 8 miles to a state park to meet Mosey, who runs the hostel I'm at tonight. Me and Stix came in a house and I've been having a great conversation with her. We've been talking a lot about recovery and she's shared that her family has struggled with addiction and she's been asking questions and seeking understanding about the nature. I had the experience of going into Wal-Mart today. Still eye-opening. We've had a guy come in tonight because he fell and is coming off the trail. He and his dog ran into a snake and that's how he got hurt. Hearing him and he share about folks they met during their hikes has been a lot of fun. Mosey is a walking, talking information book. We've been able to talk some about Jesus and scripture. I've been sitting here soaking my feet and taking all of the stories in Tomorrow is planed to be 18 miles.

I had planned to do 18 miles and knew I'd be hiking late. But I was hiking faster than I thought possible. I met a guy thru hiking that just got on in New York. He was carrying a pack-full and a book bag on the front as well. We talked for a bit about how he could cut weight. Then I went on. I ran into Stix at a fire tower around 3:30 and we realized that we had less than 6 miles to go. We stopped to eat at Gyrs and got a cold soda and a hot dog, then finished the last 3.5 miles to a really nice shelter.

One named Shadow who finishes his section hike tomorrow and myself got into a conversation about faith and the trail. During the 3 years he's been hiking, he said ""My biggest realization is that I needed to die to self."" Then he showed me his tattoo he has to remind himself of just that. After I went a ways down the trail, I met two guys who are just doing New Jersey. We talked for a bit, then one asked if I was a friend of Bill's. That lead us into a talk about recovery, with them both having over two years sober. I headed on to an AMC Center. Having to make a call to discuss something with Ronnie, it gave me a chance to eat ice cream. I hung around there a bit then did the last 5.5 miles of the day.

I made it about 4 miles to a shelter and rested for 30 minutes, then decided to go 7 more to the next. When I got there, I laid down and fell asleep for an hour, then a hiker who just hit the trail came by as I was waking up. We talked for a bit, and he told me the trail was fairly easy, so I pushed on and got to another shelter that was beautiful. I stopped there and talked to a few section hikers from Bristol and one offered to take me in when I got to his area. We talked for an hour, then I went on into town just two miles more. I'm scheduled to meet a lady Saturday with a food drop and that's half the reason I feel like I need to push myself. I made it to town and arrived at the Trail of Hope Church/Hostel. It seems to also be somewhat of a house for a few locals as they get back on their feet.

I took an orange, and we went our separate directions and I pushed on the last bit to a shelter 5 miles from where I am to meet Marie for my resupply at 11:00 tomorrow.

It had its biggest run out int he four years the event has been going on. It's the first time I've ran since the hike began. Turns out hiking has helped my running as far as I can tell. The rest of the day I've spent time with my grandparents and getting my stuff together for leaving out tomorrow.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580614,"Day 115Today was my homecoming to Holston, celebrated at Pearisburg UMC, the first church I ever spoke at. It was a wonderful morning from hearing my DS Kim Goddard speak at the ministry, to helping with the children's message. Joey and Mike from UMC were also there and starting their 3 days filming the hike. Shortstop and Lala also made the trip. After service, we were treated to a pot luck lunch. So after all that, Mike, Joey, and myself hit the trail to do 11 miles to Woods Hole, and the climb to Angels Rest was difficult. Joey made it to the overlook and decided to turn around so Mike and I pushed on. We hiked until 7:45 and got to the road. Mike fell and broke a camera lens that cost more than my car toward the end of the hike, but luckily he wasn't hurt. When we finally got to the hostel some of the hikers informed me that a wedding was taking place and everyone was excited. I was able to spend some time with Nick and Steph and go over the ceremony.

Due to the planning of it, if I hiked today and the time crunch of an afternoon wedding, I took another zero. This morning I was able to talk to a section hiker and helped him with some gear issues and the rest of the hikers here at Woods Hole have all been extremely nice and enjoyed media people being around. The wedding was set to take place at 4 on Sugar Run Mountain, a spot the couple had camped at a few nights ago. The whole day was windy, cold, and overcast. So when we got to the overlook it was very windy. But that didn't ruin the wedding. I officiated, Alan played Amazing Grace, and Joey and Mike filmed and shot it. Mary helped us all not to run around like mad men. We ended with communion. Then we came back to the hostel, and it's full tonight. WE had another great meal and talked with all the hikers here.

We stopped at the overviews and shelters. We even spent some time at Dismal Falls. We finally met Alan just before getting to 606. He'd planned to meet us before and hike more with us.

Then we went our way. I made it to Rt. 52 where Alan was picking me up and had a milkshake since the temperature was above 40 now. After I was able to talk to some locals for a bit, I gave Alan a call. I showered up and had dinner with him and Mary, a wonderful meal. Then we went to go play music with some of his friends he's played with for years. I was surprised to know a song or two. They were kind to let me play along.

As far as hikers go, I didn't see any other Sobos but ran into 5 section hikers. I talked with all of them for a bit. Most just wanting info on the trail ahead. About 15 miles in, I got to a road crossing and there sat a man doing trail magic. He comes down from Ohio twice a year and camps at that road and just hands out snacks and drinks for a week or two. I figured I wasn't going to catch anyone in person still doing that this year. It shows up when you're not expecting it.

When Alan met me, him and Mary picked me up to take me to Lindamood School since I'd done the section between last week. I planned to only go a couple miles in, but was there by 3:00 and went on the the next shelter. I arrived right before 5:00. There were two guys here. We began talking and for the past 3 hours, I shared my story as they shared theirs. They both had questions about the Bible. From asking how to read it, to the meanings of certain stories or events.

Since I was in no hurry, I took a few breaks today. When I got to the road I got a hitch into town within 100 yards. I was dropped off at the church. After talking to the sub caretaker, I went for a walk to a store. It was 4 miles away and I got a hitch about 2.5 miles in. When I got to the store, I talked with the owner for a bit and ate. Then I started the walk back, and got a hitch after about 2 miles. I learned it's easier to walk without a pack but easier to get a hitch with one. When I got to the hostel, no one else was here.

I made it at 9:30. She then offered to take me into town. An offer I accepted. During my 4 mile hike the wind blew so hard I lost my pack cover in an open meadow. After checking into Woodchucks for the next two nights, people from the trail I haven't seen in a while started to show up. One guys bought pizza for us. We sat around and watched it rain most the day. Around 1:00 a friend of mine called and asked if I wanted to go to a NA meeting in Sparta tonight, and he came and got me. When we got to his house, a tornado warning came through. As we stood on his back deck, trees falling and the wind was whipping. Then we went to the meeting.

With all the rain it was like crossing tiny streams most of the day. I got back into town around 4:30 and grabbed an early dinner then made my way back to Woodchucks.

I met Ed again down the trail and he asked for a picture. Then later in the day I met a section hiker who congratulated me. It almost feels like a victory lap in some ways. With my 20 mile day planned, I passed over a few shelters. I went over Rocky Top and shortly after passed a group of 11 horses on the trail. A sight only seen in the Smokies. I made it to the shelter around 4:00 and met a section hiker named LG. WE sat and talked a bit, then around 5:00 Grapes came in. I had met him in Maine at some point. We talked about our plans for the next week, and he seems to be on a schedule like mine, wanting to finish on the 19th as well. Tomorrow is pretty much downhill out of the park. But we have another chilly night to get through before that. So we are eating early then crawling into bed.Song of the Day: Bob Dylan - Forever Young","Clingman's Dome

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581385,"Day 143After a cold, windy night I planned to do 18 miles today. With 10 miles to get out of the Smokies and to Fontana Dam. I made my way down the mountains. I thought I had a resupply at the visitor's center, but it was closed. So I decided to push on for a 26 mile day to a hostel and just resupply from there. I called one up at random and oh, did I luck out. But during the day, I ran into some mountainers and was able to tell them about how the trail was leaving the Smokies. I ran into a few section hikers and even caught Libra on the trail. I made it to the road about 6:15 and the hostel owner picked me up and drove me to resupply and get dinner. He had two places for me to pick from and even had TV, so I can watch the Notre Dame game. It looks like I'm bad luck, though. I've been able to wash everything and relax this evening. This gave me a chance to line up my resupply coming up in Franklin as well.Song of the Day: Rocky Top","Shelter Out of the Smokies

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581387,"Day 144I woke up this morning in no rush, knowing that the hostel owner had to take hikers up trail and I was told he'd be back at 10:00 from taking them to their point. He was right on the money. I really enjoyed my stay at this hostel. I had 20 miles planned today. When I got outside, it was very overcast. A surprise based on the weather report. I hiked all day in a heavy fog and it had rained at some point last night or this morning. I didn't see any thru hikers but a large group out for the weekend and a couple of day hikers. I talked with a day hiker right before the NOC and he has hiked a great part of the trail so we shared stories for a bit, then I went on. Today had two long up hills that were both good climbs. Then downhill was made difficult with lots of rocks being wet. I made it into the shelter around 5:30. It's an empty shelter tonight but it's a dry place to warm back up. Tomorrow I have 21 miles to Franklin to meet Chris, the last person that will host me. Song of the Day: Jason Isbell - Speed Trap Town","Fontana Dam

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581388,"Day 145I woke up today with the great gift of good weather. I had 21 miles to Franklin, where I was meeting a trail angel named Chris. He offered to host met back in February when I was coming through. At the time I got his e-mail I said, ""boy, wouldn't it be great to make it there."" The trail seemed more alive today. That could be based on the fact I could see more than 10 feet in front of me. I ran into some section hikers at a fire tower that had an amazing view. We sat down and had a quick lunch. The Sobo hikers I met are hostel hopping and we're slack packing. So maybe I'll run into them tomorrow. I think the guys I'd been hiking with are a half day ahead. My friend Tom who was out doing from Fontana Dam to Springer had to pull off trail with blisters. I was looking forward to catching up to him and him getting to meet everyone at Springer. Maybe next time. Only 110 miles to go now.Song of the Day: Bily Ray Cyrus - Achie Breakie Heart","Shelter

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581390,"Day 146I slept in a bit at Chris', so I got up a bit after 8:00 and was able to move slowly. We shared breakfast together. I had a wonderful stay. I hate I couldn't of hung around longer. We were able to trade stories of being with hikers and talked about music as well. He really liked jazz and blue grass. But I forced myself to leave. I hit the trail at 10:00, only planning to do 16 miles. My shoulders were bothering me pretty bad, so I stopped at a shelter about 4 miles in and put ice hot and took a lunch. A little after that, I ran into another Sobo who I hike with some of the day. After he stopped for dinner and I decided to push toward 24 miles I ran into a couple hunters and talked to one for a bit. I was able to get to Standing Indian about sunset at 5:30 and it was amazing and I made it to the shelter about 6:10 and am spending the evening with two section hikers.

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581392,"Day 147After a night where the stars in the sky were mind blowing, I got up to a warmer morning than expected. Luck may still be on my side with about 8 miles to Georgia. I started out thinking the trail would be quiet during my 17 mile walk toward the hostel. I met about 12 mountainers working on the trail. Sadly I bet them to the blow downs and had to dance around them. I met an older couple doing a section and even stopped to talk to a Nobo starting his section. He was going to the NOC to get a head start on the bubble then coming back March 1st. I made it to the hostel around 3:00 and caught two of the guys I was hiking with before the Smokies and a couple of guys I had met yesterday. The hostel owner knew Wildcat and we were able to catch him up on the ministry since the last time he stayed here on his hike in 2015. He was excited to hear about that. Three of us have decided to slack pack back tomorrow.Song of the Day: John Mayer - Why Georgia","Standing Indian

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581393,"Day 148This morning me, rooster, and early bird took off from the top of Georgia, slackpacking 17 miles then coming back. We were told this is the hardest part of Georgia. It gave my shoulders a rest. Lots of trail maintenance going on in these parts, still cleaning from the hurricane. It took some time to talk with a few of them. We were able to hit the road around 2:00 and call to get picked back up. When we got back to the hostel, Achilles was here. I hadn't seen him since before I went home and he flew home for an event as well. We went out to dinner to catch up. The hostel is pretty full of Sobos and section hikers tonight. Everyone is very quiet and calm or so we seem. I just got off the phone with Alan going over the plans for Sunday. I also called my Grandfather to talk  to him. Besides Alan, he is the person I've talked to the most while on the trail. Tonight as we were saying our good-byes, it felt more like I was saying good-bye and leaving my home. Well, maybe I am?Song of the Day: Ray Charles - Georgia","Hostel

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581394,"Day 149I left out of Top of Georgia and got to the gap around 8:30 and we had 21 miles to Mountain Crossing at the foot of Blood Mountain. Today's section was a long climb out of the gap, then a great flat section that felt like being back in Virginia, then some rolling hills. I crossed a few section hikers and talked a bit and still got in by 3:30. It helps the trail goes right through the building. When I got here I caught back up to Moose. He was nursing a rolled ankle. Early Bird and Rooster came in a little behind me. We were treated to some trail magic in the form of dinner cooked for us by some section hikers we are sharing the hostel with. The other three guys are planning to do a 16 mile day tomorrow to avoid the rain. My plan was 24 miles. I'm not sure if I'll stick to that or not honestly. We are spending our last night watching Star Wars on VHS and cracking jokes. VHS is still big in Georgia.Song of the Day: BBS - Waiting for the Thunder","A Full Hostel

Matt Hall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581395,"Day 150I got a later start than I wanted today. The bunk house had no windows so I slept until 8:00 and got started around 9:00. With a 24 mile day and rain in the forecast for the afternoon. The goal was to be in the rain as little as possible. Lucky for me, the rain never came. Today on the trail was nuts. I hadn't seen this many hikers since the Whites. I met at least 30 trail mountainers and at least 100 hikers. I had no clue where they were coming from. I stopped and talked with a few. I made it to the shelter around 4:30 and two groups of section hikers were here. Both being fathers with their sons. We fixed dinner and they asked all kinds of questions. It was a lot of fun to think back on my hike and share stories. I'm so excited i can't imagine I'll get much sleep. With only 8 miles to go tomorrow, I think I'll be just fine. Excitement feels like new life in my limbs and mind. My soul feels at ease, a feeling I hope I can always recall.Song of the Day: Chris Stapleton - Broken Halos","Mountain Crossing

After a night with little sleep from excitement. I got to the trail around 8:00 after saying my good-byes to the hikers I shared the shelter with last night. I had 7 miles to a parking area, 1 mile before the summit of Springer. I made it there around 10:30 and waited for Alan and others to get there. I was surprised that so many of my friends came to be a part of the day. We were able to hang around the parking area and laugh, joke, and share memories. A few other hikers came through and even four other thru hikers while we were there. A group of about 12 people hiked to the top with me and we were about to share that special moment. After a massive round of photos and some time, we headed back down. I rode back to Virginia with Alan - which means we've spent the last 6 hours dreaming and talking about ways to move this ministry forward. Today was the celebration of a day I never saw coming and now I don't want it to end.
