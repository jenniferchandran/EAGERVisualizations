Walkamole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556272,"Hi all!    So, this is a quick update for this year! I drive into Boston tomorrow to hopefully make getting to the airport on Wed easier (due to winter storm Stella). I'll post from there if I've got time to kill. Got everything I need and I'll be headed down to Atlanta to shuttle to Dahlonega on Wed and will hit the trail on Thursday! I'm very excited. More to come...

Walkamole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556749,"This will be a double entry for yesterday and today. I made it safely to Atlanta and met another thru hiker on the plane! I got dropped of at Springer parking lot at 1600 with turtle and snail, a German couple in their 70s doing their third thru! Hiked into Hawk MTN shelter and spent the night. It was COLD. Not as cold?as Tuesday or Wednesday night I was told but I was chilly. It remained cold until this afternoon then it got pleasantly warm. We've got some rain coming in tonight but I'm planning on staying at Neil's gap tomorrow night so I should be all set. I think I'll pick up a sleeping bag liner just to be safe. Had a trail angel drop off pizza, beer, water, and fried chicken to myself and three other hikers. I only partook? in the first three and only slightly, but it still made my day. Camping with Foggy tonight in a cool site with tall rocks. That's all for now!","Springer MTN parking

Walkamole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557002,Today I hiked from Woody Gap up into a foggy mountain morning. I summited blood mountain right as the sun was burning off the last of the fog that came on with last night's rain. I got some great views coming into Neels gap where I planned to spend the night. Unfortunately the hostel there was full up (they gave the last bed away 30 min before I got there) so I decided to push on to look for a campsite as sheltered from the wind as possible. JR (from Charlottesville) joined me and we set a good pace together. We ended up at Baggs Gap (we think) and spent the night camping with a ridge runner who thru hiked last year. I got a liner for my sleeping bag and a new dry bag as my old one finally broke at the buckle! I've seen lots of dogs with day hikers so that's really nice,"Woody Gap

The temperature got down to about -1.1 C last night but the wind was blowing a gale. It made Ireland wind look like a gentle breeze! The sleeping bag liner really helped (but I ate the Snickers for? saftey and scientific purposes) JR and I broke camp early and hiked into unicoi gap (mile 52) and hitched a ride into hiawassee after some trail angels (rainman and fireball) graciously fed us burgers, dogs, and boiled peanuts!

Slept like a log last night and was very grateful for the roof, bed, and warm meal. My stomach is still adjusting to southern town food so that's been fun but oh well. Going to see a film also so we have an excuse to sit and do nothing! JR and I are looking to be in Franklin,NC on the 25th to meet up with some friends of his and to resupply. After that we're hoping g to be able to really start adding some miles! There's still a fair bit of snow ahead of us so we're trying to time our passage through the Smokies appropriately.

Carrying five days of food is heavy! 
The old axim ""be careful what you wish for..."" was proven today. This first week the weather has been crazy. -1.1 c sunday morning and 29.4c this afternoon! Thunderstorms rolling in tonight but they'll be gone by morning and we'll have another awesome hiking day. 
This will be my first night spent in a shelter and it's filling up quick. Pineapple, joker, bulletproof, Alex, Johnny Walker, momentum, shutterbug, muffit, Jameson, eclipse, and more! Everyone is in very good spirits though. This is the comradery that you hear about and long for out here after a hard Day's hike. 
We hit our hardest mountain yet! Kelly knob! One mile of hot and steep! But we made it.

Hiker hunger man...      We meant to just go into Fontana to resupply and mail stuff out but by the time we all got there the post office was closed and we stopped for a quick meal and it was all over. Next thing we knew we had rented a room for the night and we're washing our clothes in the tub. The hot shower and meal was nice though!

We had a very long uphill getting up into the Smokies after crossing Fontana Dam but were rewarded with a magnificent hiking day. In the 12-17°c range with a breeze.       At around mile 6 for the day we stopped at shuckstack fire tower. I lost the battle with my fear of heights on that thing. I made it to the top but the fear sweats were on full force and the hikers I met at the spur trail which connected the fire tower to the AT said they could hear my curses from down in the valley!         Arriving to camp at around 7:30 wasn't very fun but second dinner made up for it.

Not too many aches or creaky joints.        The strange shock of seeing people today was odd. The road up to the dome brought a lot of people to the view and all I could smell was laundry detergent and drier sheets was nauseating. The odd looks I was getting was off putting and all the screaming children really ruined the magic of the moment. However, the ability of everyone to access that place is cool I guess...      Spending my first night in a shelter tonight which is kinda shitty but (speaking of which!)

We managed to get a ride into Hot Springs late this morning from Max Patch Road (just shy of the mountain which bears the same name) in a very windy and wet blizzard. We decided to skip one day (and the worst) of the bad weather due to one of our hiking party's knees (Wayne's) being injured (f**ked I believe is the medical term for this phenomenon). We got a ride in from a very nice (and British) woman named Tracy. She was very accomodating and kind to us smelly, cold hikers. When I called she said ""okay, on my way! I'm in a blue Subaru Forester"" to which I said ""okay! I'm in a one piece tan rain suit! I look ridiculous, very hard to miss"". As predicted, we made contact without any issues.        We hopped (Wayne limped actually, she'll be taking a week off) into Hot Springs where we checked into our hostel (free coffee!!!) and then went to the local diner for lunch (I had pinto beans, homemade coleslaw, homemade, cornbread, potatoes, and homemade hot pepper relish accompanied with a side salad. Then a slice of carrot cake (yum). As we were finishing our delicious meal, a gentleman (Wailyn) asked us if we were thru-hikers. We responded in the affirmative and he said ""well then, I'm picking up your tab"". Our jaws hit the table. I don't care what anyone says about the south, people here are the most kindhearted and thoughtful souls I have ever met.      After thanking him heartily and chatting with him for a while I went down to the local coffee shop for an espresso (Tracy recommended I go). I chatted with the owner who hiked a few years back (trail name: Sunny). She actually was born in Rockland, ME and we chatted about the commonground fair and MOFGA and sustainable farming for a bit.

We got shuttled back to max patch road and pineapple, alex, and I took off through about an inch of new snow. The snow was only above 3500 ft in elevation. We went over max patch mountain which was the windiest hiking I've ever done. You physically couldn't stand up (65 mph winds at least) and we got across the top quickly. Our gear kept us plenty warm (don't worry aunties). On the other side of the Bald peak, right where the treeline resumed, two other thru hikers who we'd seen yesterday when we got picked up, were huddled in a one man tent with the other wrapped around a tree, poles and all! We asked if they were okay and one said that the wind wrecked his tent and they were calling for a shuttle and that his sleeping bag was wet. Their ride was on the way but I gave the poor guy a space blanket and some toe warmers that I'd found in a hiker box the day before and wished them luck. We carried on and went on and out of the snow all day as we climbed and descended. It was an amazing hiking day and we walked back into hot springs just in time for first dinner. We went to the local tavern which was packed but had some good live music. Alex decided on a trail name today: Garbahnzo (yes, with an h). Him and I tented out front of laughing heart hostel.

We parted ways after breakfast at the gallery (best apple turnovers and coffee this side of the Virginia border, and fair trade local roast at that, highly recommend if you're ever in hot springs).     I also got a package in HS from the Dufaults.

We bought them and brought them back to the hostel and asked a thru hiker (ladybug) who is a hair stylist to cut our hair. She said she'd be happy to and we offered $5 for a cut. So it ended up being cheaper to do that than going to a salon!!! It made my day.

Speaking of last night...       So this morning we woke to a totally still world at the summit of Unaka. And the first thing I noted when I woke up was that I smelled smoke (did I leave the oven on?) I thought the Canadians a quarter mile down the trail had started morning cook fire until I realized the wind was coming from a different direction. The first few miles of hiking were very hazy and all you could smell was wood smoke. I passed four wheel drive and he said he didn't smell anything.       We ran into a kind gentleman doing a little trail magic about 5 miles in and we asked him if he knew about the smoke. He said someone three counties over had started a fire, but it wasn't headed our way unless there was a dramatic wind change and it couldn't be contained (10% as of this morning). He said if they caught the arsonist they should ""take a hot iron to his balls"". Which, I thought was a fitting punishment considering the damage wildfires cause.

Walkamole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560766,"Scene 1:       A dark campsite somewhere past Iron Mountain Shelter in Tennessee. Two tents are set up next to each other, both containing a smelly thru-hiker. Alex: ""Oh man""Kal: *laughter*Alex: ""its the blubbering owls again""Kal: ""what do they have to talk about at one in the morning?""       That's how I started my day. With a family of six or seven barred owls right outside mine and Alex's tents chattering away at 00:52. For those of you that are not Mike Harvey and do not have a PhD in Ornithology, are not an avid bird watcher, or just have never heard a barred owl call before... I strongly encourage you to look them up. They sound like a bunch of punk kids laughing at a stupid joke while huffing helium. I heard them my first night on the trail and several times since, but never this bad. It was honestly comical at that point, all we could do was laugh... If you can't tell, I'm also at a library computer (hooray real keyboards!).      When the sun came up later, rain was pattering on the silnylon of my tent fly. a wonderful sound for sleeping but a less than stellar noise when you've chosen to live in a one man front entrance tent (OMFET). trying to extricate oneself from a OMFET is an acrobatics act during dry weather but when it rains, it makes the task even more fun because of the added fun of water dripping into your tent from every vibration on the frame once you unzip the fly. Its a petty issue I know compared to many of those in the world but I still need to vent (tent pun?) somewhere right? But I digress.       The rain luckily slowed down to a lovely soft drizzle by the time I emerged cursing and spluttering into the world. A fine spring day actually. So, soggy tent fly on the outside of the pack and properly stored dry clothes on the inside, Garbahnzo and I started our 21 mile day to the campsite just shy of Damascus.        The rain stopped shortly after we started and the wind picked up to allow for a free blow dry of my tent fly and managed to dry it out by lunch (hooray!). The final miles out of Tennessee were lovely and relaxing: broad flat trails with mild changes in terrain over long stretches and light packs made the miles breeze by. Due to this, Alex and I decided to do a 23 mile day into town and get a hot meal (the temptation was just too much). We managed to do a 23 mile day in 9 hours! We weren't pushing for speed, it just happened (well, maybe a little bit). We also crossed into Virginia and out of Tennessee! Now only 500 miles in VA!       Upon entering Damascus, we did what any sensible hiker would do when entering an unknown town in the now renewed rain: we got Mexican food. We walked into Hey Joes Mexican and were promptly treated to a corona each by some fellow thru hikers who were there celebrating one of their tramilies birthdays (thanks again guys!).       Nachos and spinach salads in our bellies, we then checked into ""The Place"" a hostel run by the methodist church in town and it was as clean as a Naval Vessel. Very tidy and rather strict on rules but it really kept the riff raff out at the Broken Fiddle Hostel and ensured that everyone was in bed by 10 (we didn't need any encouragement after our 23 mile day and then our walk to the resupply food store and back). The bunks didn't have any mattresses so we had to use your sleeping pads which made an ungodly (its punny because we were in a church) screeching noise whenever you moved. like those owls, it was just comical. Insert the earbuds and problem solved.     I also found a pair of crocs in the hiker box at the place, I was looking for some because I kept smashing my toes on sticks in camp and it was really getting old after a month of twigs and branches jamming into the front of your toes. They're yellow however so I look extra ridiculous. Thats all for today.

He's the guy behind me in the picture with the almost identical ""my parents lost me in a supermarket when I was a kid"" green Patagonia puffy. Luckily when we got to the bottom, a wonderful retired couple (Jerry and Caroline) were looking for some hikers a day ahead of us who'd left their trekking poles down in Buena Vista. They decided to give out some trail magic which was awesome as only six of us got it and there were sandwiches, fruit, cheese, wine (best $2.80 bottle ever!), candy, honey buns, avocados, and more! They were very friendly and by the time we all headed back out to do the last few miles to Harpers Creek Shelter we were all hugging Caroline goodbye (maybe that was the wine). Harpers Creek was an amazing shelter (awesome river right next to the shelter and very picturesque). Jam (as in a Jam session or jamming out) had some speakers and he had the best playlist ever! The tunes in camp at the end of the day were awesome and really boosted everyone's mood I think. Ace and Yak (the fellow in the front of the picture and the chap with the white ski poles to the right of me in the photo respectively). Mantis (a chap from Worchester, MA we were hiking with) mentioned these two guys and it was nice to finally meet them. 
Thats the day! We decided to try and push into Waynesboro (27+miles) tomorrow. We'll see how it goes!
