Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554427,"So I've been preparing for this hike for 40 years! Well, not really, but I did start dreaming about it 40 years ago (see the 'About' link to the left), then seriously considering a thru-hike as a possibility 3 years ago. Like many potential hikers, I've been voraciously reading books, trail journals and everything AT related in preparation for this crazy adventure. I've taken something away from all of my reading, but have found one particular book most useful: Appalachian Trials by Zach Davis (trail name, Good Badger). Badger's book is not so much about gear and the technicalities of backpacking and thru-hiking, but the mental and psychological aspect of a thru-hike. I like that he gives the reader some homework to help mentally prepare. So, my first few posts will be devoted to my ""homework"" while I wait for my journal to go live! Badger advises to publicly state your plan, to make it real and to make yourself accountable, so here goes........I'M GOING TO HIKE THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL IN 2017!",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Fri",0

After a lifetime of family and work responsibilities, it's my turn!3. I'm a nemophilist! (see Trail Name to the left)4. I think I have the personality traits and skills necessary to succeed. I'm persistent and stubborn!5. I like walking!6. If not now, it may not ever happen!7. I want to be a bad-ass 60 year old woman! All thru-hikers seem to say they want to be, or are, bad-ass, but if I can persevere and not get sick or injured, I'll turn 60 years old on the trail and in my mind that takes it up a notch.",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Wed",0
Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554794,"When I successfully thru-hike the AT, I will.....1. be a bad-ass 60 year old woman!2. feel so proud of my accomplishment but also relieved and probably a little sad that it's over! I hope that my children and grand children will receive some inspiration from my achievement to reach for the sky and follow their dreams to the fullest extent.3. I'll hopefully be a bit wiser and a few pounds lighter, though the core of who I am will still be the same! I'm not expecting a thunderbolt of enlightenment, but very open to it if it happens.4. I'll be ecstatic to see the most important people in the world to me: Mr Nemophilist, my wonderful children and grand kids and my 80 year old hiking Mum, Frolicking Dinosaur. If I give up on the Appalachian Trail I will.....1. be disappointed but proud of how far I got and know that I did the best I could!2. be injured or sick.3. have learned what my limitations are.4. not beat myself up, but contemplate lessons learned. I'll keep this quote in mind: “Failure is not to be feared. It is from failure that most growth comes.”So there you go!

I know I'll have plenty of days ahead of me like this, but I would hate for my first day to be one of misery, so I'm delaying my start until tomorrow. Yesterday Mum aka Frolicking Dinosaur and I drove to Waynesboro, V.A., the town closest to the southern end of Shenandoah National Park. The plan was to pick up a rental car, then drive 70 miles north to the  Skylands Resort where we would spend the night, then leave her car there and go back to Waynesboro. She would hike with me back to her car. We almost didn't get the rental since there was a mixup about what time I'd pick it up and the car rental place had zero cars. Fortunately there was a return after about 20 minutes and I was soon on the road in an upgraded car. We spent the night in the very rustic but charming Trout Cabin at Skylands. Today we booked a room at Quality Inn, returned the rental, and arranged for a shuttle ride to the AT  for tomorrow morning.

Saw lots of wildflowers and native azaleas, including Silene  caroliniana which interestingly enough despite its species name is more prevalent in Virginia. I grow and sell this plant for my little farmers market plant business. Two fellas we met at a spring complimented Frolicking Dinosaur on her  badassery for backpacking at age 80 and she was quite pleased! We received wonderful trail magic from a couple of section hikers, Goose & Clink at  Turk Gap. They gave us each a cold tangerine, took our trash, & best of all filled up our water bottles. We are in a 12 mile dry section and were running low on water. Their generosity allowed us to stop early and have enough water until we reach the next spring tomorrow.  Low mileage today but it's not a speed race!

We were making good time until about 11am when I felt really dizzy for about a minute and had to sit down. We had been trying to conserve water since we only had only a liter a piece to last all day. After a good swig of water I was fine. I glanced at my thermometer to see it was already 85 degrees. We plugged along, finally reaching Blackrock Hut around 3:30 tired, thirsty, and sunburned since the trees haven't leafed out yet. After dinner we had a discussion as to whether Frolicking Dinosaur should continue because she appeared to be struggling and I, obviously worry about her. We decided to wait and see what tomorrow brings since the best bet for catching a ride would be at the Loft Wayside which we will be close to tomorrow. There were some rowdy young lads in the shelter but all quieted down as the sun went down until a couple of whippoorwills got started and serenaded us all night long","Stealth camp @ 875.2

The climb out of the shelter brought us to the summit of Blackrock mountain with it's expansive views and impressive boulder fields. I remembered coming here when my family car camped in Shenandoah National Park 21 years ago, though I'm pretty sure we drove up rather than hiked. As the morning wore on I began wondering if I was on the right trail. Last December we took a family vacation to St John USVI and enjoyed hiking some of the trails in the Virgin Islands National Park. Today hiking the AT felt like hiking those trails...hot and humid but with no leaf cover for shade. My little thermometer registered 95 degrees at one point. Frolicking Dinosaur was done early so we found a spot to camp on the outskirts of Loft Mountain  campground since it wasn't yet open for the season. I took a quick walk around the campground to reminisce of when we stayed here 21 years ago. It's still a lovely car campground and I saw 3 does munching on the yet to be mowed grass. Our campsite tonight was a beautiful spot on a ledge overlooking the valley and we were treated to a fabulous sunset!","Black rock Hut

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563091,"Not only were we treated to a beautiful sunset last night but the sunrise was equally beautiful! We got off to our earliest start so far as our morning camp chores and packing have become somewhat second nature. We had a 2 mile hike to get to the trail that would lead us to the Loft Wayside, a small cafe and gift shop. We saw a large copperhead cross the trail on the way. He was at least 5 foot long. At the Wayside I managed a quick bird bath and washed my hair in the ladies room which felt wonderful and was thankful for that too short haircut I was complaining about a few weeks ago. Although it was only 9:30 am, I craved a salad and the cook obliged. Frolicking Dinosaur and I each enjoyed one of the blackberry shakes that SNP is famous for. Yum! Needless to say Frolicking Dinosaur is continuing on, so back to the trail we went, she on an easier trail that would put her one mile ahead of where I got back on the trail where we got off. While waiting for me to catch up she saw a  black bear scampering off into the woods. Although still quite warm today, it was not as bad as yesterday and fueled by blackberry milkshakes we arrived at the Pinefield Hut quite early to set up our camp and have a leisurely evening","Loft Mountain Campground

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563097,"We had pleasant conversations at Pinefield Hut last night with 2 Japanese men from D.C. who were hiking all of the AT in the park but using 2 cars. It was their first time backpacking but they seemed to have it down pat and were having a good time. It was much cooler this morning and quite foggy. Before long it was misting rain and I had to bully Dinosaur into using the Frogg Togs umbrella we brought along so she wouldn't get wet. It felt so good after several days of extreme heat,  but before long a steady rain began to fall and we had to pull out our rain jackets. We stopped at Smith Roach Gap and Dinosaur held the umbrella while I made us a cup of tea to go with our peanut butter crackers. As we climbed Hightop Mountain both the rain and wind picked up. The hut was quite full although there was room for us if we wished. We decided to tent and found a site with few overhanging limbs since the hikers in the shelter warned of very high winds tonight. By 3pm we were in our tent with winds that sound like a freight train alternating with bands of heavy rain.","Pinefield Hut

The gusty winds dried everything very quickly the next morning and we were soon on our way enjoying perfect blue skies and great hiking temperatures in the mid sixties. You'd think that you would be looking around enjoying the scenery when hiking but it's necessary to keep a close eye on your feet and the trail ahead of you. This point was brought home to me today as I took my first tumble. Luckily no injuries except a bruised ego. One of my favorite things today was the mile after mile of blooming trilliums carpeting the forest floor. Just spectacular! It was great to meet Lauralee ""Blissful"" Bliss, ridge runner, for the SNP. I subscribe to her blog and am a member of the Facebook group she moderates. She was very kind, inquiring about our hike and making sure we were OK. I must admit to being a bit starstruck. We put our longest mileage day in yet putting in a big push to get to Lewis Mountain Campground and the promise of a hot shower. We arrived at the campground just after 6 to find the camp store that could provide us quarters for the shower closed. We received our second instance of trail magic when the young guy camping next to us brought over quarters and wouldn't let us reimburse him. Best 5 minute shower ever!","Hightop Hut

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563135,"Our plan was to take a day off hiking today but it was a bit too cold to lay around camp unless we lay in our sleeping bags all day, so we did laundry and decided to just go ahead and hike. While our clothes were washing we enjoyed a microwave jimmy dean sausage biscuit and fresh brewed coffee. My standards are already slipping as I'd vowed to eat only healthy food on my hike and I don't think that biscuit fit that criteria.  It was a beautiful crisp day and the trail was kind to us with lots of flat and easy hiking. Our goal today to reach Big Meadows Campground and the opportunity to eat at another Wayside. We stopped at Milam Gap and realized we would have to walk 1.7 miles in an hour to get to the Wayside before it closed which is a much faster pace than we have been keeping. It was here that we met Rooster and he reminded us that if we wanted something bad enough we could do it. Well, we hiked that 1.7 miles in 45 minutes and each enjoyed chili, huge salads with grilled chicken and to top it all off another blackberry milkshake. Any other time I would have been stuffed by eating such a volume of food, but was only pleasantly satiated. We burped our way up the road a mile to our campsite for the evening.","Lewis Mountain Campsite

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563136,"This morning I got up and hiked back to the Wayside and down the shortcut we took to get there last night, then walked the AT back to the campsite. I'm a purist in that I want to walk past every white blaze on the trail. Some purists believe you should carry your pack every step, but not me. Since Frolicking Dinosaur stayed at the campsite waiting for me,  I didn't have to carry it unless I wanted to. There is a saying among hikers that everyone should ""hike your own hike"" and I subscribe to that belief as long as it doesn't impact others around you in a negative way. Today was my last day to hike with Frolicking Dinosaur since we will reach her car at Skylands. It was a colder,  blustery day and we had a lot of rocky ridge walking. We are heading to the nearby town of Luray for a couple of days of relaxation before Dinosaur heads home and I continue on alone.

We walked at a slower pace than I probably would have alone,  but I think that was probably a good thing to help transition into my hike. Because of her slower pace and frequent breaks, she sees a lot more detail than those racing to the finish. She was constantly pointing out new wildflowers we hadn't seen yet, interesting cloud formations or gnarly tree stumps. I hope I don't lose that ability to stop and smell the roses as I hike on. And hey, have I mentioned my Mum is 80 years old and just hiked 70 miles on the AT! She is an inspiration to me!","

It was misting rain and quite chilly, definitely raincoat and wool hat weather. As the morning progressed it became a steady rain but I was warm enough until I stopped to eat a protein ball and my hands got cold. I definitely started considering calling a hostel for the night when I ran across a ""Trail Magic"" sign. The trail quickly opened to a picnic area with a covered shelter and a huge fireplace with a blazing fire. A church youth group beckoned me close to the fire and I was offered an array of food! It was pure bliss! I ate a hamburger from the grill and several homemade cookies. I soon dried out and chatted with these outstanding young people! A young girl shyly offered me a homemade granola bar for the trail. Talk about serendipity! I resumed hiking warm and dry, with new confidence. The rain stopped though it was still cold and breezy. Nearing Mary's Rock I ran into 2 nice women (cuppa tea and I didn't catch the others name) who were members of the Trail Dames hiking club. We chatted on and off as our paths kept crossing. I've noticed that the last few days the trail bed is supported by miles and miles of rock walls. Probably a WPA project constructed  during the depression. Very impressive! I finally crossed Thornton Gap and it was only a mile to the hut. Nice friendly people here tonight! I'm in my LightHeart Solong6 tent again! It is going to be a cold night!","Skylands

Though another brisk day I soon warmed up and I made good time to hike the 7 or so miles to Elkwallow Wayside, the last one in the park. Just before the Wayside I met 2 young hikers coming from the other direction who had just seen a bear. Never the less it was gone as I walked by because I never did see it.

I shared the dorm like Hostel with brother/sister duo Rash and Piñata and a young woman called Snap. It certainly wasn't fancy but met all a hikers needs. I dropped out of Shenandoah National Park shortly after leaving the Hostel and the trail went mostly downhill to cross Hwy 52 that went into Front Royal. Quite a few hikers were preparing to hitch to a town but I've got enough food to get me to Harpers Ferry so continued on. It was't long before I got to the Denton Shelter which has to be one of the nicest on the trail. It had a big porch with chairs and benches, a separate cooking pavilion, solar shower, and a horseshoe pit. Even the privy had toilet paper and hand sanitizer! It was early in the day and I could have walked more miles, but I decided to stay. I had the place to myself for several hours, so sat on the porch and enjoyed a pot of hot tea. Soon a couple and their dog I had met on the third day arrived. They are heading north but always walking south by using 2 cars. They lived on a sailboat in the Bahamas and we had interesting conversation about the Caribbean. As the sun went down and until about 10:30 all those hikers I had seen going to town started to show up and there was some loud and rowdy shenanigans going on.

They seemed to be all northbounders that started in Georgia, so are putting 20-30 mile days. Doubt I'll see them again. As I hiked this morning I heard a thunderous noise that I couldn't figure out. Turns out the trail crosses railroad tracks and a train was going by. Next was a short road walk that went underneath I-66. It was startling to hear the loud rumbling of cars going overhead. I reached the next Shelter at about 2, and spent about an hour hanging about.

Rain was forecast but none was yet falling so I decided to hurry up and get moving. Just as I got out to take the tent down it started to pour. I donned my raincoat and rainskirt and started hiking. Little did I know how this day was going to test my resolve to hike the trail. Pretty soon I entered Sky Meadows State Park, which I'm sure must be very beautiful, but I didn't see much of it as it started to thunder and lightening lit up the sky so I kept my eyes on the trail ahead. Pretty soon the Appalachian Trail became the Appalachian River and any attempts at keeping my feet dry became pointless so I just sloshed on through. There were quite a few stream crossings that you would normally rock hop to get across but that was impossible with the roaring torrents tumbling down the mountainside. I simply plowed on through, with the water sometimes almost coming up to my knees. I also have a pack cover to keep my backpack dry, but it kept filling with rain and I'd have to stop to empty it. Luckily I had taken some advice to line my pack with a trash compactor plastic bag and it kept everything dry. I have to say I was quite miserable and would have gladly gone home if that was an option! I stopped at noon at the Rod Hollow Shelter to eat lunch and figure my next move. As long as I was moving I stayed relatively warm but stopping made me really cold, to the point I could hardly get my fingers to move. A German couple were in the Shelter huddled under an emergency blanket. All their gear had gotten wet so they had it strung over clothes lines in front of the Shelter. I decided that I didn't want to go on any further, so staked out my place under the leaky roof and set up my sleeping pad and down quilt. I spent the afternoon dozing, reading and chatting with the German couple in my cozy cocoon. For some reason it took my feet until the middle of the night to warm up but otherwise I was as comfortable as could be expected under the circumstances. About 8pm a group of young people plus an older man arrived to fill the Shelter up for the evening. I'm fairly certain the older gentleman was a homeless fellow. He was missing quite a few teeth, the front of his boots were not attached to the soles, and he slept in a blanket, certainly not the high tech equipment most hikers carry. He slept between me and the German couple. What a day!","Campsite @ mile 986.1

My day started with attacking a section of the trail called the Roller Coaster, a 13 mile section of steep ascents and descents. It soon became clear that I had made the right decision to not try to do this section yesterday. It wasn't too bad, though some parts were really rocky and others muddy from yesterday's rainfall. Although rainfall was again forecast it held off most of the day. I set my sights on getting to Bears Den Hostel and out of the weather. It started raining about 1/4 mile before I reached the Hostel and set in for the night. The Hostel was one of the nicest I've seen. It was a huge rock home that the AT conservancy bought and converted to a Hostel. The stay included a bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, soda, and a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, all for $30. What a deal! Homeless guy showed up about an hour after I did. He asked for a work for stay option, but someone else already had that gig. I think some other hikers picked up his tab. He's definitely a traveling man, a modern day hobo, well spoken and articulate, though perhaps a bit eccentric. I guess that adjective pretty much describes most of us out here!","Rod Hollow Shelter

There were three more miles to knock out on the Roller Coaster, then the trail evened out somewhat, though it was still very muddy and rocky in parts. I crossed paths throughout the day with 4 fellas and a couple, both section hiking, who I met at the Hostel. We all had decided on hiking to the same Shelter. The fellas were funny in that they packed in some dry logs to start a campfire. They also had some freeze dried beer that I've read about, the brewing of which was quite hilarious.

She agreed to come to my motel room and work on my arm. She was absolutely amazing , working on the muscles and ligaments for over 2 and 1/2 hours. She was an interesting woman and fun to talk to. She determined that the pain I was experiencing was all part of a long standing wrist problem. I had resorted to steroid injections last year when nothing seemed to help. They probably masked the pain without addressing the structural problems and when I started vigorously hiking with my trekking poles she thought I probably got a small tear in a ligament.

When the conversation turned to stories of women killed on the trail, I excused myself and hiked on. I'm sure he was harmless, but just the same not a pleasant topic to choose to talk about with a solo woman hiker. I did read one of the storyboards in the park about a huge civil war battle that had taken place at Crampton Gap, where I intend to sleep tonight, and over 1000 men were killed.","Harpers Ferry

The trail crossed I-70 on a footbridge and I was soon at my destination, a little too close to the interstate, but I was too tired to go on any further.","Crampton Gap Shelter

I ran into my sailboat friends and their dog for the third time. There  was a lot of rock scrambling today and in fact it was hard to follow the trail in some areas. You had to follow red flags rather than the usual white blazes. At one point I got disoriented along with fellow flip-flopper, Funky Duck, luckily he found the white blazes that got us back on track. The last climb of the day was brutal with the additional insult of having to get and carry water halfway up the climb since the Shelter had no close by spring.

I did pass one of the cutest shelters on the trail, Tumbling Run Shelters. It had separate shelters for snorers and non-snorers, clotheslines, and a huge cooking pavilion. I think I could have lived there. There was also a resident  black kitten. I think this was the same cat written about in the log at Deer Lick. Someone had wrote in the shelter log that Blueberry had carried the cat away. Evidently this was as far as Blueberry was willing to carry the cat or kitty liked this Shelter as much as I did. The trail was pretty rocky before dropping 3 miles down the road that led to the Hostel. I called in hopes of getting a ride, but Junker, the manager, was away for the day, so .8 miles more of road walking was added to the day. About halfway along the road walk, I came upon Timbers restaurant that had been recommended to me multiple times. I stopped in and had a delicious burger and fries. The owners were very welcoming and interested in my hike. I signed their hiker board. At the Hostel, I met Sam, a young women who had just started her flip flop hike in Harpers Ferry. She clued me in on how the Hostel worked and asked if I'd like to walk up to the Dollar General with her. I did need some resupplies and quarters for the laundry, so after a shower, off we went, another mile and half to the store. Turns out Sam was from a town very close to where I went to high school in Michigan. We quickly purchased our supplies and decided to give hitchhiking a try to get back to the hostel. Evidently this is a skill we need to work on because no rides were offered. So although my official AT mileage is 13.2, I walked an additional 4.6 miles doing town chores.

We again tried hitching the .4 miles back to the trail but to no avail. It wasn't too bad on fresh legs. We did notice a pair of trekking poles leaning against a light pole on the other side of the road and wondered how they got there. The trail meandered through Caledonia State Park which looked very nice. Sam quickly moved ahead of me and I didn't see her the rest of the day. The trail was very pleasant and easy to walk. So far I've really enjoyed Pennsylvania, though the dreaded rocks are yet to come. I got to Birch Run fairly early and still had some juice in the tank, but since rain was forecast, decided to stay. Sam, now Honey Stick, and Funky Duck were already settled into their sleeping bags. We were shortly joined by Peanut and Floater, a young female section hiker whose name I don't recall, and Woody, another urban outdoorsman. Peanut built a warming fire and told about how he had got off trail to spend time with a friend and inadvertently left his trekking poles at the side of the road at the pick up point and amazingly enough they were still there when he returned.

At Toms Run Shelter I stopped for an early lunch and said hi to Peanut and Floater who were enjoying a break and chat in the shelter. I asked them if they had done a dance around the halfway sign since they had been started in Georgia, but they laughed and said they hadn't seen it and walked right past. A group of men showed up just as I was getting ready to move on who were members of a Greenville, SC hiking club out on a group excursion. We chatted briefly and they invited me to join there club when I get done with the trail. I made quick time to Pine Grove Furnace State Park where many hikers take part in the 1/2 gallon challenge which involves eating said amount of ice cream within 1/2 hour. Unfortunately the store was closed and there were many disappointed hikers gathered on the porch. Guess who most of them were? The frat house gang from 10 days ago who I thought I'd never see again! Evidently they all had got a bus ride back to Damascus VA for the Trail Days celebration and were just now getting back on trail. Although I'm sure they are a nice enough group of kids, I find them a wee bit loud and boisterous, so decided to cut the day short and spend the night at the Ironmasters Mansion to give them time to get ahead of me. While waiting for it to open I walked through the adjacent AT museum.

I enjoyed a huge sub sandwich and a bottle of cold Starbucks frappuccino and then watched Sparky, another resident of the Hostel last night, begin his half gallon challenge. Not wanting to linger, I didn't watch him finish, though I knew he survived it since he passed me a couple of hours later.

The white blazes and arrows had hikers scrambling and squeezing around and over seemingly impossible boulders and rocks. Just when you thought you were finished it gotcha again. Just made me laugh!

I should have been enjoying this but for some reason wasn't feeling it today. I was tired from not sleeping well and my feet really hurt today. I quickly reached Boiling Springs and a small park where I lay out my tent and tarp to dry. While they were drying I sat on a park bench and watched a fly fisherman pull out one trout after another. It was catch and release, so maybe it was the same fish but it kept me entertained. Boiling Springs was very quaint and I could have lingered but I wanted to get 8 miles down the trail to Carlisle where I had a motel reservation and a resupply box waiting. I stopped  3 miles shy of my destination to soak my feet in a cold stream and that gave me the impetus to carry on.

My feet are still bothering me and the shoes that I bought 200 miles ago, now feel like instruments of torture. I think my feet may have gotten bigger and wider, causing my toes to feel pinched and causing some blisters. I met a young guy out hiking for the weekend and he was wearing Teva sandals to hike in. After chatting to him about his footwear, I decided to try out hiking in my camp shoes, some water Crocs. Bingo! Much more comfy. At the Shelter, I met Hopefull and Redwing, a former thru-hiker couple who were out with three kids plus their year old baby. Kudos to them for introducing their kids to the outdoor life. The evening ended with a huge 5 foot long black snake deciding to take up residence on top of the bear box where we all needed to store our food overnight.

Duncannon is home to the Doyle Hotel, a seedy guest house and restaurant/bar that caters to hikers. I had no intention of staying there because I've read too many horror stories, but I did think about having a bite to eat since the food has a much better reputation. Unfortunately it wasn't yet open and I got tired of waiting so I continued on. The trail went for about two miles through town and people I saw were very friendly and wished me a good day. The trail then crossed 2 bridges, one of which spanned the Susquehanna River. The trail crossed a busy road and railroad tracks then started climbing sharply up to a very rocky ridge line. I intended to walk much further today but that climb did me in. Maybe I should have waited for the Doyle to open after all and filled my belly.  I decided to stay at the first Shelter I came upon. A lot of hikers that had stayed at the Doyle were heading to the next Shelter so I knew it would be crowded.

I got going early and the big surprise today was seeing my first bear or rather it's rear end. I was keeping an eye on my feet as usual and suddenly heard a big disturbance to my right. The bear must have been searching for bugs on a downed tree and scampered down the ridge when he saw me coming. I'm glad to have got that over with and that the bear did what it was supposed to do. Hope any future sightings go as well. Being a holiday weekend, there were quite a few day hikers out on the trail and I crossed paths with one particular family several times. I stopped at Peters Mountain Shelter for lunch and found the family having their lunch at the picnic table. They invited me to take a place at the table but I didn't want to submit them to my hiker stink, so sat on the steps nearby. They were eating  Pringles chips with their sandwiches and I got the impression that they didn't regularly eat them since Mom said it was special treat because  they were hiking. Mom offered me some and being the hungry hiker that I am, accepted and helped myself to a generous portion. I saw the little girls face drop with disappointment  and Mom reminded her that it was nice to share. I felt bad about taking so much of the kids special treat, but dang it I'm so hungry all the time. Sorry kid, but thank you! Next I met three women hiking south on a section hike and we exchanged pleasantries. I told them where I intended to camp and they said a hiker called No Rush was camped at that spot too. I'd heard about No Rush and he turned out to be just as eccentric as described. He only hikes 5 miles a day hence his trail name. He carries several pounds of coffee and stops to brew some up every hour or so. He told me he had been in a terrible motorcycle accident and had been taking all kinds opioids and had a prescription for medical marijuana to control the pain he suffered, but since starting his hike he found he didn't need any of that anymore. Definitely a trail character. I asked him if he usually hung his food in a tree (especially since I'd seen a bear today). He said he usually didn't but would give it a try.

It really adds a lot of weight to your pack to carry wet gear but there was nothing to be done about it at this point. Again, thunder and lightning started crashing around me, so I called out bye to No Rush, sensibly still in his tent, and started hiking. Fortunately, the storm didn't last long and I was soon taking off my rain gear, though still packing that wet tent. The trail was wet and muddy so I wore my hiking shoes again today. I laced them loosely and maybe because they were wet all day and had a little more give, they didn't hurt my feet as much. I planned on sleeping in the Shelter tonight but a couple of miles before reaching it I started to be passed by hiker after hiker, hiking at a powerful pace.

I mention this because extra water needed to be carried since there wasn't another spring for 16 miles. It is not suggested that anyone drink from some of the first springs because of pollution. The climb started steeply but wasn't anything I couldn't handle. There is a blue blaze alternate route that can be taken to avoid the Superfund site that I would probably have taken if I knew what was to come.

I remembered seeing this section in lots of photos I'd seen showing people helping others up by offering a hand and giving them a pull up. I tried to go up but felt very unsafe with my backpack on. Remember that extra water weight I was carrying, it made me feel very unbalanced. I took my backpack off and was able to maneuver up the rocks ok without it, so I thought to myself that I'd tie my rope to my backpack and pull it up.

No problem they said. They told me to go on up and passed me my backpack.

The trail continued through the Superfund site. It looked like the area was coming back slowly, but some of the older trees were dead. It was very strange to see these skeletons interspersed with the new plantings. There were a lot of interesting plants that had been put in as part of the remediation, though I was surprised that some of them weren't native.

I saw a turkey in the Superfund site yesterday which was a hopeful sign. The creature I've seen most often is the millipede. Seems like a lot of them die crossing the trail and armies of ants take care of the funeral arrangements. I wonder if they are victims of us hikers stepping on them or something else. It's  definitely  perilous for a millipede to cross the trail. I did receive nice trail magic from some Boy Scout leaders who replenished my water supply that was getting low. I then didn't have to walk a mile off trail to a nearby spring. Had good phone calls in the evening to help overcome homesickness with Mr N, Frolicking Dinosaur, and my daughter, who celebrated her birthday by skydiving.

What kept me going was the promise of a stay in town and a shower. Pennsylvania was not going to let us go without more rocks, though they didn't seem quite as bad today. I ate lunch at the Kirkridge Shelter with Hickory and Low Tech before beginning the descent into Delaware Water Gap. The trail goes right through this scenic little town so my first stop was an ice cream shop for 2 scoops of Minty Mint. I then headed over to the Hostel hosted in the basement of a local church. The Hostel allowed dogs, so unfortunately smelled like a kennel plus smelly hikers. I decided to pitch my tent behind the church.  Next up was a shower, but it appeared it hadn’t been cleaned in a while, at least not this year anyway. A shower was necessary after such a hot day so I powered through the ick factor. It obviously didn't have a trap installed in the drain and there was a bad sewer smell for a minute, but thankfully dissipated pretty quickly. I joined Hickory, Low Tech, and several other hikers at the local pizza joint for dinner and a few beers. On the walk back to the Hostel I received a call from Mr N  telling  me that Frolicking Dinosaur had been bitten by a copperhead snake while gardening today. He had rushed her to the emergency room and they were keeping her overnight. She is expected to be ok, but was obviously in a lot of discomfort.

A man stopped at a small picnic area and offered me some trail snacks from the trunk of his car. I didn’t refuse and packed them away for later. There was of course a climb out of the gap but it wasn’t too bad. The forest was beautiful and soon the climb ended in a nice vista over the valley. I stopped to call home and was relieved to learn Frolicking Dinosaur was released from the hospital. The trail then went down to Sunfish Pond, a glacial lake that is considered one of the seven wonders of NJ. It was very scenic. The trail followed the pond for a little over a mile and was quite rocky. The trail then followed a ridge and was blistering hot again. My stomach still felt queasy, so I didn't  eat lunch but still tried to keep drinking water. I took many breaks and finally reached the road that would take me to the Mohican Outdoor Center where I had a resupply box waiting for me.

Two months of bars, nuts, peanut butter, rice, oatmeal and junk food is really starting to wear on me. I really miss fresh veggies and the healthy diet I eat at home. My interaction with Quick Start and PWH drove home the loneliness and homesickness I was starting to feel.

The side effects were horrible and I wasn’t able to complete the whole course. I saw my chiropractor for an adjustment and she suggested that perhaps my stomach problems were related to a massive detox since I had ended up losing 20lbs in a fairly short period of time.

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578259,"My goal today was to get to a Campground about a mile off the trail that offered showers, laundry, and a short order grill. It was easy walking, mostly downhill and visions of a hamburger and fries kept me moving at a pretty good pace. When I popped out on the road I met Tarheel, a former thru hiker from the class of 1979. He was waiting for his thru-hiking daughters to offer them some trail magic. He offered me a ride to the campground which I gladly accepted. Unfortunately the camp store was closing early for a family event, so no burger and fries. I was able to purchase a huge ice cream cone which was almost better! While checking out the laundry room I met Wanda who with her boyfriend, Steve had evacuated their home in Florida ato avoid hurricane Irma in their RV. She invited me to eat hot dogs with them and I had a great evening learning about their travels all over the US in the RV. They were really nice people and enjoyed hanging out with them. Two great big dogs, Doug and Pippa slept on the porch of the camp store so I didn't hang my food in a tree.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578260,"I finally enjoyed a good nights sleep but because I was camped on grass and next to a stream had quite a lot of condensation on the inside of my tent. While things were drying out I went in search of a real breakfast. I met the friendly proprietor, Susan, and she fixed me scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries and toast which I ate while chatting with her. It was great! When she asked me my name and I told her Nemophilist, she said it was too hard to say. She looked at me intently for a few moments and said “I’m going to call you Nanna!” And that’s what she did. Maybe I have a new trail name. Funny thing is that is what my grandkids call me.
I hung around the Campground until Susan had a spare moment to drive me back to the trailhead. Another great stay off the trail. There was a bit of a climb to start off and then the trail paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway for the rest of the day. Susan had prepared me a big deli sandwich and a small bag of salad for lunch. It was delicious! It was quite warm and I didn’t feel like putting in a big day so stopped early. Section hikers, Beth and Randy are here tonight and a thru hiking southbounder called Happy Feet came in just before dark. We think she sounds like she is foreign, like maybe Russian, but she claims to be born and raised in Maryland. It is something about the inflection of her voice!

Everyone else at the Shelter pushed off and I was last one out at 8:30. After the initial climb up from the Shelter the trail was really nice and flat and kept crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway every so often. At one point I popped out of the woods at a pull off to see loads of cars and people sitting in camp chairs. They were a hawk watch group and were offering trail magic to hikers. I had a salted caramel hot chocolate and took an apple for later. No hawks had been sighted yet because of the fog but they told me 400 had been counted yesterday. The trail continued to be very pleasant and I stopped at the Wilson Creek Shelter for lunch. A hiker called OK stopped too and we exchanged pleasantries. I thought about the new trail name Susan had given me and decided to reject it. I really like Nemophilist and that feels like who I am on the trail. I’m Nanna to my grandkids! At Curry Creek I had to stop for water since there would be none at the Shelter tonight. After loading up with 3 liters which weighs 6lbs, of course the trail started some steep climbing. I eventually got to the Shelter and thought I would be the only one here for the evening until about 8 to 10 others arrived just as it was getting dark.

Most of the other hikers were already gone except one guy and his dog and then they soon departed. Since I had more time this morning, I had one of my special breakfasts, grits and sausage. The grits are stoneground from Hagood Mill near home and the sausage from Calley’s Coop, one of the vendors at a local farmers market that I am involved with back home. I cook them then dehydrate them. In camp I just pour boiling water over the mixture and let sit for 30 minutes until hydrated. It was delicious and since I was heading into town for resupply and hiker hunger has kicked in, I ate 2 pop tarts too! The trail was an easy downhill and except for a yellow jacket sting as I stepped over a log, uneventful. I was checking into my room by 11am. First order of business was a shower followed by a great lunch at 3 Little Pigs BBQ. I spent the afternoon doing laundry, cleaning and organizing my gear and planning the next section.

I enjoyed scrambled eggs, bagels and cream cheese and a bunch of tasty little lemon poppyseed muffins. I took my time getting ready but was still back on the trail, which ran almost right next to the motel, by 9:30. Most towns and road crossings are in a Gap so of course there is always a climb up the other side. It was a gentle climb with lots of switchbacks so not too bad at all. There were some pretty vistas looking down toward Carvins Cove Reservoir. After lunch it really got hot and my pace slowed and I took lots of breaks. I got to the Shelter about 4:30 and All Red was here. He thru hiked in 2010 and just likes to come back now and do section hikes. He was a nice young guy and built a good fire. The water here is a bit sketchy. The Creek has lots of frogs and even though I filtered it, it has a fishy smell. I think I will add some aquamira drops to disinfect it tomorrow. My dinner was a dehydrated pasta primavera dish and was definitely one of the better recipes i’ve concocted. A German couple then several other section hikers arrived and it’s now quite noisy.

I had allowed a lower mileage day so I could enjoy the sights plus camping is only allowed at Shelters on this section. First up was Tinker Cliffs which the guidebook described as .5 mile cliff walk. I was a little nervous about this because it brought back memories of the hairy cliff walks in PA and NY. It was nothing like that at all, in fact was an easy stroll with some splendid views of the valley! All Red had told me this was a great section because few day hikers make it this far. He was right and I didn't see a soul and got to enjoy it all to myself. I stopped at Carter Shelter for lunch and to get water for tonight since all the springs are dry ahead. There was a puppy tied up to the picnic table with no human in sight. Eventually a guy emerged from a nearby tent. He was a little off and made me feel a bit uncomfortable, so when he asked if I was hiking alone, I used the line that my friends were coming up behind me. I soon made it to McAffees Knob the most photographed vista on the trail. As I approached the Knob about 50 rowdy young girls were thankfully leaving. This is a super popular day hike and I was fortunate enough to spend about an hour and half here with very few people. I asked a group of people if they would mind taking a photo of me sitting on the ledge. They obliged, but it was so funny. One of the women in the group kept cautioning me and yelling “that's far enough honey, that’s far enough!” I’m so thrilled to get my iconic AT picture at McAfee’s Knob! The only thing better will be my summit photo of Mt Katahdin, sometime in the future I hope! I moved on and hiked to the Shelter past hoards of people heading up to the Knob for the sunset which must be spectacular. I thought I was going to be the only one at the Shelter but about 5 women showed up just before dark. They kept to themselves and weren't the usual friendly hikers you encounter. Maybe they thought I was a little off! Haha","Lamberts Meadow Shelter

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578758,Evidently it's also popular to hike up to the Knob for sunrise too! There was a steady parade of noisy day hikers that started at 4am. It was only a mile hike down to the parking area which was filled to the max and had a park employee directing operations. As much as I enjoyed this section I was glad to leave all the crowds behind. Next up was Dragons Tooth! Before the climb began there was some pleasant hiking with gentle ups and downs and even through pastures. I met a flip flopping thru hiker called Halfway who was planning to stay at the 4 Pines Hostel and eat at a local country cooking restaurant called the Homeplace that is a hiker favorite. I briefly thought about going too but decided to push on. The climb up to the Dragons Tooth was brutal including lots of rock scrambling and a few rebar ladders.  It was like PA and NY! I just took it really slow and avoided looking down. The views were great but again lots of people and I was glad to head off into the quiet woods on the AT as all the day hikers went back down the way they came. The Shelter is 3/10 mile off the trail but I found a good camping spot before I reached the Shelter.

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578760,I had just enough water to make my EmergenC orange drink and had that and 2 pop tarts for breakfast. It was just over a mile down the trail to a stream and road crossing. I filled up with water and stopped to enjoy a second breakfast of oatmeal and hot tea. The trail did some climbing up to a ridge and was pleasant hiking. I did feel myself dragging a bit today and think I didn't eat and drink enough yesterday. One of the funniest moments on the trail today was when I ran into a corps of ROTC students from VA Tech marching toward me on the trail. I pulled to the side and let them pass and everyone of them said “Good Morning Ma’m”. Later as they marched back I got a “Good Afternoon Ma’m” from each of them. When I got to the Audie Murphy Memorial it was such a peaceful place that I ate lunch and lingered for over an hour. Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier of WWII and evidently became an actor and poet. This was the spot where he tragically died in a plane crash at a young age. There were several benches and people had left all kinds of memorials such as dog tags and flags. I felt myself going slower and slower and had drunk all my water. Southern Virginia is currently very dry and many of the springs and creeks are not flowing. I finally came to a stream that wasn’t totally dry but was puddled up and not moving much. I did see some trout swimming around so figured the water couldn't be that bad. I loaded up and mixed up a liter of electrolyte mix and downed it. I suddenly realized that I had not been sweating or peeing as much today. I need to be more careful tomorrow and think I’ll carry more water. I got to the Shelter at 4:30 and there was a good spring flowing. Halfway from yesterday arrived with tales of wonderful food at the Homeplace.

Nemophilist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578762,"After rehydrating I felt much better and I hiked much stronger today. The day started out with a pretty good climb and then followed a rocky ridge line for some time. There were some interesting cairns built long ago by settlers who once must have farmed here. They were so meticulously built rather than just piled up like you would expect from someone clearing a field.
I saw my second bear today or rather it saw me first and I saw it’s back side as it lumbered away. I had just thought about stopping for lunch before seeing the bear but then decided to delay for a mile or two. When I did stop for lunch I could hear cows mooing down in the valley below and it wasn’t long before I was down in a field with them. I have to admit they are intimidating beasts and I was a bit more afraid of them than the bear. Near the edge of the field of cows was the Keffer Oak, the second largest oak on the trail. This imposing tree is believed to be over 300 years old. I guess all that cow manure under its branches is keeping it pretty healthy. Next up was a road crossing with some trail magic. Someone had left a pile of diet mountain dews, so I helped myself to one and enjoyed it immensely. There was more pastures and another road to cross and just a few miles to the Shelter. A young hiker called Hatchet from Columbia SC is here. He told me he’d been feeling lonely today and had built.a fire to cheer himself up. We chatted until Hiker Midnight which seems to be getting earlier and earlier with the shorter days. I can hear coyotes yipping and howling in the distance.","Niday Shelter

I spoke briefly with him and he said he was hunting squirrel. About 20 minutes later I heard gunfire and thought some poor squirrel is going in a stew! After crossing the road the trail got very rocky and I wondered for a minute if I’d made a wrong turn and ended up back in Pennsylvania. At Bailey Gap Shelter I ran into Old Woman and Wrong Way Charlie for the 3rd day. I might see them again in Pearisburg when I get there tomorrow. The trail crossed Stony Creek and traveled along it for a while. While getting water I met Bog Angel and Milkshake who were going to stealth Camp at a picnic area to rest their shin splints. I was disappointed to see that the Captain’s Place is still closed. He used to have a zipline across the creek so hikers could stop in for a soda or camp on his lawn. I would seriously have done that for a cold soda today! I stopped at Pine Swamp Branch, a Shelter that is currently closed because of many dangerous dead trees due to a gypsy moth infestation. At the picnic table I met Overload another fellow South Carolinian and solo female who is section hiking NOBO. We exchanged intel on what the trail is like ahead.

Hiker hunger seriously kicked in over the last section and although I wasn’t about to starve to death, I never really felt full. A block of cheese, bag of Fritos, and a package of fig newtons can add some poundage and I wondered if I had made the right choices halfway up the mountain.

An awesome breakfast was served of eggs, sausage, peach crisp and homemade bread with apple butter. Everyone was expected to pitch in on the prep and cleanup. It was a bit chilly today but quite warm on the porch. Another hiker, Sails Away and I managed to while away the morning playing with the resident kitten. Sails found some tuna and wraps in the hiker box and made us a mini lunch and I bought us each one of Neville’s delicious cookie bars. Neville then invited us both to eat a lunch of leftovers with her and the work for stay hikers, Simpleton Extraordinaire and Footprint, so we ate again.

Slackpacking involves being shuttled ahead on the trail and then hiking back to the Hostel.

We would be hiking north today, back towards the Hostel. It was quite chilly this morning but hiking soon warms you up. All the rhododendrons looked very wilted and I wondered if it was that cold or because of the dry conditions. Probably the serious lack of rainfall here in southern Virginia. I decided to take a 1/3 mile spur to see the pretty Dismal Falls though my hiking companions declined. We hiked together for much of the day but on occasion would hike separately because of our different paces. The hiking was quite easy with lots of level trail through the green tunnel. I stopped at Wapiti Shelter for lunch. This was the site of a grisly murder of 2 young hikers back in the eighties. It was such a beautiful spot that it was hard to believe that such a violent act occurred here. Mudsmeller said she didn't want to stop because it gave her the heebie jeebies.

There was a slight incline at first but then the trail leveled out and was pretty easy. Water continues to be a problem and I wished I had drank more at the Hostel before I left. Some of the SOBO hikers I met at the Hostel had formed a private chat group that allowed them to share trail information with each other. They added me to the group and it is very helpful to know the water conditions ahead. I saw so many deer today that I lost count. I really love when they just stare at you and are seemingly not afraid. They twitch their noses, taking in your scent. Maybe they don’t run off when they smell stinky hiker versus hunter smell. I stopped at Jenny Knob Shelter for lunch and got some sketchy water from a small pool. I crossed paths with a hiker called Sleeve several times during the day and when I arrived at VA 611 he was there with Chaser, a ‘16 thru hiker. Chaser had heard about the dry conditions and was offering some trail magic to hikers. He had 10 gallons of water, beer, whiskey, coke and all kinds of snacks. I passed on the beer and whiskey but did fill up with water and enjoyed a couple of cups of coke and some gooey chocolate coconut confection. I took a few more snacks for later.

It kept about 100 yards ahead of me and would keep stopping and looking back. I called to it but it wasn’t having any of that. Shortly I heard a struggle and squawking in the bushes and realized some poor bird had become Kitty's breakfast. I never saw the cat again. I didn't stop at Helvey’s Mill Shelter for water thanks to Chaser’s generosity yesterday plus I knew there was a surprise coming up when I got to the road crossing near Bland. Someone had posted in the chat group that there was a deli not listed in the guidebook! It wasn’t what I would call a deli, here in the south we call it country cookin’. The special was beans and cornbread for $2 and there were lots of locals and the local police force partaking. I had my heart set on a cheeseburger, fries and milkshake and it was very good. It’s so interesting that hikers can eat such large amounts of fattening fare and still lose weight. It’s difficult to eat enough to fuel your hike.

I can hardly get up and out of my tent at night to pee without tripping so I can’t imagine how I’d hike in the dark. I did hear a large animal pass though camp last night though. I shined my headlamp out there but couldn't see anything. My destination today is Atkins and an indoor stay at a Motel with a sketchy reputation. It is supposed to rain tonight, plus a tropical storm is headed this way. God knows this area definitely needs the rain! The trail passed through lots of farmland and pasture today. It was interesting to note all the different ways of letting hikers pass over or through the fence lines. Stiles that you climb over seem to be the most common. I always enjoy the change in scenery that hiking through farmland provides, though some attention to foot placement is required to avoid treading in cow patties. I’m very thankful to the farmers for allowing the AT to traverse their land. I soon arrived at the Relax Inn and it definitely appeared to be past its heyday. The sheets and towels were clean and the hot water plentiful, but beyond that, not much can positively be said. I thought the bathroom window must be open because I could clearly hear the interstate traffic in the room. Further inspection revealed a piece of plastic duct taped about 20 years ago over the window opening. Someone had signed their name in the dust on the tv screen. Mold was plentiful and if you are reading this to help plan a future hike, I’d try to avoid this place at all costs. Testing your limits is an important part of the AT hiking experience, so this stay definitely tested my tolerance for sketchy accommodations. I had dinner at a Mexican Restaurant attached to a gas station that had been highly recommended. You wouldn’t normally expect a lot from restaurant attached to a gas station, but it was very good!

When I woke up at my usual 6am it was raining but my weather app reported it should stop by 7am. I packed up and went over to the truck stop gas station next door. Those egg, sausage and cheese biscuits that you heat up in the microwave are not too bad. By 7:30 just as it was getting light I was hiking up the trail. I soon arrived at the Settlers Museum and the Lindamood School. Of course the museum was closed at this hour on a Sunday morning but the school was open. What a neat building with old school desks and a wood stove. I learned that the museum welcomed hikers to spend the night inside the school and was sorry I wasn't aware of this since it would have been a big upgrade from the Relax Inn. Next up was the climb up Glade Mountain and it got foggier the higher I climbed. There was a great view of Walker mountain with the valley below shrouded in fog. I really enjoyed hiking in the cool fog and misting rain. The young couple who were in the room next to me last night passed me. I told them of my plan to go into Marion to avoid the upcoming storm and to pick up my next resupply box which I would have to wait until Tuesday to retrieve because of the Columbus Day holiday. I wasn’t sure how I would get into Marion, some 8 miles from the trail, but thought I'd figure it out once I got to the Mt Rogers Headquarters. By 1:30 I was approaching the Headquarters and saw an older gentleman and a hiker standing next to a van watching me approach. It turns out it was Trail Angel Jim getting ready to give fellow hiker, Counselor a ride into town. The young couple had told them I also wanted a lift, so they were waiting for me. The repeated and unexpected kindness I have experienced from total strangers while hiking just blows me away and helps restore my faith in humanity!","Atkins VA

It was cheaper than the Relax Inn in Atkins but a great Motel. It was an older property but immaculately clean with modern conveniences. It was windy and rained last night so I was glad to be inside. I had been told not to miss Sisters Cafe downtown and so set off on the 2 mile walk to town in the rain. It was the kind of place where ladies do lunch, where I’d do lunch with Frolicking Dinosaur or a friend. Anyways I did get some sideways glances and the service was a bit slow. I guess I did look a bit of a mess, dripping wet, hairy legs, in my trail outfit in which my shirt has developed a hole where my pack rubs and my camp shoes which are a pair of water crocs. Despite all that, the food was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch. My waitress was a bit cool but finally warmed up to me when I told her about myself and how the place had been highly recommended. I left her a good tip even though she didn't really deserve it. I had to spend another night at the Motel since my resupply box won't arrive until tomorrow on account of the Columbus Day holiday. Nine is staying in the room next door. She is the hiker who had added me to the chat group at Woods Hole. I was surprised to see her since she's young and a faster hiker and I expected her to be well ahead of me. She developed an abscessed tooth and had to have a root canal. In the evening I had a video chat with my grandson about his recent award for being the 1st grader of the week at school and his upcoming birthday. I told him that I was getting ready to hike into the Grayson Highlands where there were wild ponies. He asked me to bring him one!","

I thought they might be ticked off since I didn't stay there but it was no problem. My food bag was enormous because I wasn't sure what Frolicking Dinosaur had put in my box and I over bought snacks and lunch items. Anyways it took me a while to get it all organized on a bench in front of the motel, then I had to walk over to the Walmart next door to catch the bus back up to the trail. I talked to Mr N on the phone about my over abundance of food and he suggested that I give some to the homeless man I had told him about, hanging around the motel. Brilliant idea and I’d just seen him in the lobby of Walmart, but when I went looking for him he was gone and the bus arrived. So I returned to the trail with a very heavy pack and I certainly shouldn't be hungry in this next section. It was 2:30 by the time I got hiking but I did want to get a few miles in for the day. About 4 I started to hear thunder in the distance and my weather app showed rain was coming this way. I got to this campsite, put my tent up, ate dinner and hung my bear bag just as the rain started.

The sound of raindrops on the roof of my tent made great background noise for a good nights sleep. Whatever weight I had reduced in my pack by eating dinner and breakfast was negated by the fact that I was now carrying a wet tent. My pack felt like a 100lb bag of coal on my back and I felt pretty miserable all morning. Note to self….never carry too much food again! (Right!) I stopped at Trimpi Shelter and ate as much as possible of the heaviest food. I re-evaluated my destination which had been the Hurricane Mountain Shelter and saw that 3 miles before I could take a side trail to a National Forest campground that my family had visited 15-20 years ago. I remembered it being very pleasant, showers, picnic tables etc. The thought of stopping a little early, drying my tent out and sitting at a picnic table to eat more food from my food bag sounded very appealing and the rest of the afternoon went by much more pleasantly. Lots of hikers don’t like to pay for a campsite when they can camp along the trail for free. Not this hiker.

I did feel refreshed and renewed and my pack felt like a normal first day out of town weight again. It was a beautiful day and the trail is pretty level in this section. My Mum, Frolicking Dinosaur, was going to hike this section with me but unfortunately she is still having complications from the copperhead bite she suffered last summer. When the snake bit her, it severed the tendon in her finger and this was only recently recognized. Recovery from surgery to repair the tendon has been slow so she decided to forgo the hike. I hope we can come back and do this section together sometime in the future. A southbound bubble passed me today and we all ended up stopping at Fox Creek for lunch. They said they had been seeing my entries in the shelter logs and wondered who I was and what Nemophilist meant. I usually just date and sign Nemophilist :-) They had all stayed at the Trimpi Shelter last night and didn’t realize that Mudsmeller was also there. They had all appreciated her updating the water situation on the Guthook App that most of us use, so I let her know. This afternoon I was surprised, though I shouldn't be, to see Wizard hiking toward me. He said he had jumped ahead to Damascus and was now hiking north to get off the trail to spend time with his sister and his girlfriend. I’m sure I’ll see him again when he resumes hiking. Seemed like most that were passing me today were headed to the Wise Shelter that prohibited tenting. I was heading there but changed my mind and stopped at this nice stealth site.

I changed up my morning routine and retrieved my food bag then prepared my breakfast and coffee just outside my tent, enjoying it from the comfort of my sleeping bag.  I soon found the cows I had heard mooing last night. They were the longhorn type of cattle and I must say those horns make me a little nervous. There was a mama nursing her calf and I was glad she was otherwise preoccupied. I was excited to be entering Grayson Highlands State Park with its herd of wild ponies that help maintain the balds. I soon entered the Scales which is a fenced in area used for rounding up the cattle and ponies. The area was socked in with fog and there was light drizzle. Even though, it was very beautiful, but the expansive views were not to be seen today. I was beginning to wonder if all I was going to see was pony poop today but eventually I did see some ponies. Years ago when I was here, there were large herds of ponies that would run up to you and I wondered if the herd was now smaller or the weather was a factor. Passing out of the State Park, I entered the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area. After squeezing through a narrow rock passage called Fat Man Squeeze the sun finally started to shine. There were lots of Fraser firs growing in this alpine like environment and it smelled like Christmas. There were also lots of great campsites in this section but it was still a little too early to stop. I did find two sweet little ponies and made a video to send to my grandson for his birthday.

It is the best thing ever! I use it as a towel to dry myself off  and it works great for wiping down a wet tent. I prepared breakfast in bed again and sipped my coffee as I packed up in the tent. It was a quick 2 mile hike down to Elk Garden which I recognized from vacationing in this area years ago. I had a quick video chat with my grandson to wish him happy birthday! He said he would like me to bring him both ponies that I had videoed for him yesterday. Next was the relatively easy hike to Whitetop Mountain which was appropriately covered with clouds. On the way to Buzzards Rock I passed an obviously recently vacated campsite with a campfire still smoldering. The area was surrounded by  dry grass and forbes, and of course loads of leaves plus there was a steady breeze blowing. There is no excuse for this kind of lack of common sense in the back country. Incredibly there was a strong spring flowing right next to the site and this made my job of extinguishing the fire pretty easy. My anger was soon dissipated by the beauty of Buzzards Rock. The 360 view was incredible and it was so neat to see the fog rolling in and the valleys below bathed in sunshine. I decided to eat lunch and was soon joined by a Geology class from University of Florida on a field trip to study of all things, the local rocks. They were a great group of kids and I enjoyed chatting with them about their studies and many were interested in my hike. Today's hiking was either nice and level or downhill so it wasn’t long before the AT intersected with the Virginia Creeper Trail, an old railroad bed now converted to a biking/hiking trail. You can rent a bike and be shuttled to the top of Whitetop Mountain then pedal down the trail back to town. My son and I did this when we visited years ago and it was great fun! Being a beautiful fall Saturday, there were tons of bicyclists out enjoying the weekend.

The trail paralleled the Virginia Creeper Trail for some of the day and again there were lots of cyclists enjoying their Sunday. When I stopped for lunch, a guy who was trail running stopped to chat. I asked him for a recommendation on where to stay in town and he told me most hikers stay at Woodchuck Hostel. It wasn’t long before I heard the road ahead and before I descended the steps down to it found a styrofoam cooler full of trail magic. Most of it was dry goods but there was a bag of tangerines.

I washed my pack in the bathtub to try to get rid of the nasty funk it has taken on. I was a little worried it wouldn't dry since it was cool and cloudy, but it did and smells so much better. I was able to find a shirt on sale to replace the one with holes at one of the local outfitters and I also ordered new shoes to be delivered to my next stop since my current ones have over 600 miles on them and are starting to deteriorate.

This section includes lots of just tramping through the woods without any big scenery. Being a Nemophilist, I’m quite happy with this and loved the  crunching sound of the leaves as I stepped on them and the crisp fall air. The trail did go through some cow pastures and the cows were docile and not frightening at all. I was glad to see lots of Monarch Butterflies feasting on the last clover and Queen Anne Lace flowers in the pastures and I encouraged them to hurry and fly on to Mexico. This section also included about 1/2 mile of wheelchair accessible trail which was great to see.

I have to admit to feeling quite thirsty and quickly downed a liter of water. I also prepared and ate the dinner I had intended to eat last night. Feeling much better I continued on my way down the trail that followed a ridge line high above Lake Watauga and then went steeply down to Wilbur Dam Rd. The trail then went back in the woods and eventually to and across the Watauga Dam that formed the huge lake. It was quite impressive and scenic. The trail followed the shoreline for sometime before heading up toward the Watauga Shelter, closed because of a nuisance bear. I obeyed the instructions nailed to a post and didn't linger.

The outdoor shower was pretty unique too. The shower head was as metal washtub with holes punched in it that as it filled with water rained down on you.

Just before crossing the railroad tracks I saw a huge pile of fresh bear scat that helped speed up my progress across the Nolichucky River bridge and to Uncle Johnny’s Nolichucky Hostel. I was going to stay in the bunkhouse but it had a funky smell probably due to the 16 year old resident pooch, Jerry Garcia, who had his own sleeping place in there. I opted for a cabin and may stay here until the weather clears on Monday. Rain is forecast for tomorrow and possibly snow on Sunday.","Campsite @ 1834.1

Frolicking Dinosaur had sent me an old fleece jacket that I had requested but when I saw it I realized it was way too thin and the zipper was broken. I decided to take the dinner shuttle to town and see what I could find at Walmart. I was able to find a fleece jacket, gloves, and balaclava. While waiting for our driver, Shuttle Bunny, I offered my old Jacket to Mudflap and he gladly took it.

I spent it catching up on tv shows that I like to watch on my phone and reading Uncle Johnny’s book on how he ended up starting a hiker hostel in Erwin TN. The only hiker that decided to hike today was Mudflap but by 5pm he had called the Hostel to say he needed picking up because he had gotten wet and was really cold.

When I got coffee at the store I learned that Mudflap had made it back safely last night. He had got wet and cold and couldn't get a fire going. It was the consensus that he had done the right thing to call for a pick up. Of course there was a climb up from Erwin and to be honest I didn't feel very well as I started the climb. I felt nauseous and dry heaved a couple of times. The floor in my cabin was particle board and with the heat on I think was releasing some glue vapors that had been giving me a headache over the weekend. I suspect my feeling ill was related to this. I sipped on water and sucked on a couple of mints and soon felt better. There was quite a bit of snow on the trail and it was confusing but beautiful to see both snow and the changing leaves at the same time. When the sun hit the trail it appeared to be snowing as it melted out of the trees. I stopped at No Business shelter for lunch and several southbounders were there also. They were complaining about being cold though were only wearing shorts and t-shirts. I have many layers on and felt warm enough. I guess these guys hike so fast that they are warm while hiking but then cool down pretty fast during breaks. After crossing Spivey Gap I found a nice campsite 2 miles shy of where I intended to camp so decided to stop a little early. I had a bear bag mishap tonight when my rock bag got stuck in a tree and I had to cut it to retrieve my rope. The rock bag was handy though not necessary to get the rope up over a limb but I will miss it.

The days are getting shorter and shorter leaving less time for hiking. Many hikers choose to hike in the dark with a headlamp  but I don’t feel comfortable doing that. I had a surprise today when my daughter texted me that she and her boyfriend were going to hike from Sams Gap towards me. After not seeing any family for almost 2 months it was a great morale booster to get me going this morning. I stopped at the Whistling Gap tent site where I had planned to stay last night, for breakfast. I really enjoyed a concoction of hot chocolate and a Starbucks Via and the usual oatmeal. I once liked oatmeal but am getting very bored with it. I crossed paths throughout the day with a hiker called Redbeard who actually had a grey beard, though I guess it once was red. There was quite a bit of climbing today and there was still a lot of snow and ice on the north side of the mountain. I stopped at Big Bald Shelter for lunch and Redbeard was there too. Soon Mudsmeller and  Cutie  Handful arrived also. They were slackpacking north from Sams Gap to Spivey Gap today. The highlight today was crossing over Big  Bald with its panoramic 360 view. I had hoped to meet Klaire here but our timing didn't work out that way. I met them a mile later and they  brought me a sandwich, chips and a Kombuchu drink. My second lunch was delicious. We had an enjoyable time hiking back to Sams Gap. It was just fantastic to see them and so much fun to catch up to date on what's going on in their lives.

Since they are hiking without a tent they decided to stay put. I didn't think I could make the Jerry Cabin Shelter which was another 6.7 miles but other hikers had told me there were potential campsites before that. It was only 3:30 so I proceeded forward. I am camped at what some might think a strange spot. It is a place where 2 confederate soldiers were killed and buried as they returned to their families. I’m not spooked by stuff like that and it is a pretty site. I paid silent homage to the young lives lost and wondered if this was the inspiration for the novel, Cold Mountain.

At one point I thought I should get out and tighten up the guy lines but didn't and everything was fine. It did sprinkle with rain a couple of times but with all that wind I was dry by morning. I was curious about the graves of the soldiers buried where I was camped, so when I got service on my phone I googled their story. Turns out I was wrong, they were Union soldiers. Surprisingly a lot of mountain folk in Eastern Tennessee sided with the Union.There were 2 civil war headstones for William and David Shelton who were uncle and nephew making there way back from the war to visit family. There was also a newer headstone for a Millard Haire who was a 13 year old cousin guiding them through the mountains. Apparently they all were ambushed by Confederate soldiers and killed. The family buried them in a mass grave and only recently was permission granted by the forest service for the tombstone to be placed for the 13 year old cousin who, since he didn’t serve in the military, was not entitled to a civil war headstone. It is a terrible and sad story. It must have been very difficult time to have lived. Heavy thoughts were soon banished by the glorious warm and sunny day. I stooped for water and a snack at Jerry Cabin Shelter just as the the Trail Dawgz arrived. We chatted about our itinerary for today. I just wanted to see how things turned out and see where the day took me. There was a fork in the trail today at Firescald Knob. There was a choice of taking a blue blaze bypass since according to the guide “AT between bypass points is rocky and strenuous”. I decided to take rocky and strenuous since if I intend to complete the trail from NY to ME I have got to overcome my fear of rock scrambles with a loaded pack. I actually enjoyed this section and had a lot of fun. The views were amazing. When I got to Little Laurel Shelter it was only 3:30 and I still had some gas in the tank.

I don’t know if I’m getting stronger or the trail is a tad easier but I did it! I was lucky to see the 3rd bear of my hike as it sauntered across the trail and went down a ravine. A friend made me chuckle when she posted on Facebook that I need to keep my eye out for Goldilocks now! I soon passed the 3 section hikers though they did catch up to me at Spring Mountain Shelter where I had stopped for an early lunch. It rained for about 20 minutes while there but fortunately I stayed dry. The sun kept peeking out throughout the day and showcased the magnificent fall colors. The maples, oaks, and sourwood are really showing off. The trail did pass through areas where the fire roared through these mountains last year. The forest is very resilient though some of the damage is still very apparent. The hike down into Hot Springs had some great views of the French Broad River, whose headwaters are close to where I live. There were some black clouds brewing in the distance and the heavens opened up just as I got into town. I got a little wet on the last 1/2 mile to the Hostel but it actually felt good to cool off.

They were a fun group to hike with over the past weeks and I’ll miss them. With the time change I was heading out the Hostel door and hiking on the adjacent trail by 7:15. The climb out of Hot Springs was a heart pumper though probably not as bad as heading out of town as a north bounder and having to climb up to Lovers Leap that I had descended as I came into town. The big climb today was up Bluff Mountain which seemed to take most of the day. The switchbacks and frequent breaks made it bearable though there were no outstanding views from the top. I finally made it to Walnut Mountain Shelter which has a reputation as being one of the mousiest shelters on the trail so you can bet I set my tent up.

I shot upright banging on the side of my tent and yelling “get out of here”. I was sure a bear was out there! Mudsmeller answered “it’s just us” as her and Cutie headed down to the picnic table at the shelter. I think I scared them as much as I scared myself. It was a funny trail moment. Everyone had a good laugh, especially my family back home. This was the start of one of those days. I went to make my breakfast and quickly realized my fuel canister was out of gas. Fortunately my hiking companions had an extra canister that they generously allowed me to use and I didn't have to eat cold oatmeal. Rain was forecast and it didn't take long for a steady drizzle to start. It wasn’t cold so I didn't bother putting on my raincoat until I approached Max Patch Bald. Just before reaching the next shelter, I slipped on a root and as I tried to stop my fall with my hiking pole, fell backwards on it breaking it in two. I was not hurt and managed to splice it together with a twig and it worked fine until the last climb of the day when the twig broke. Fortunately I will be in Gatlinburg tomorrow and can purchase new poles. The hike over Max Patch was socked in with fog and rain and I was glad that I had day hiked here in the past and have seen how beautiful it is. Towards the end of the day the sun finally appeared, though more rain is forecast for tomorrow. We are all sleeping in the shelter to avoid getting our gear wet.

Many of the trees were coated with frost and hoar frost covered the ground.The trail follows the spine of the Smokies so can be quite intimidating with sharp drop offs on either side. I stopped at Charlie’s Bunion, a popular day hike in the park. The view was just beautiful and all of us there were treated to the sight of a bald eagle swooping overhead and down into the valley below. I found a perch to sit and eat my lunch and chatted with some of the day hikers. There were many great views today but it remained quite chilly which encouraged you to keep moving. I ran into Ghosthiker today who I had last seen and eaten lunch with at a shelter in Maryland. Hikers are required to stay in shelters in the park and thru-hikers can only tent if the shelter is full. There was a half mile walk off the trail to our shelter tonight and it sounded like a party in full swing as I approached. There were several groups already in the Shelter including a group of young guys out for a weekend hike. They had hiked in a 12 pack of beer, many flasks of whiskey, packs of sausages, and a wireless speaker. Needless to say they were complaining of blisters and sore backs. Since the Shelter appeared full I found a spot to set up my tent with some space next to it for Mudsmeller and Cutie. As I cooked my dinner the guys offered me beer, whiskey or a joint. I did take them up on some whiskey for my tea. After Mudsmeller and Cutie arrived and got their tent set up we chatted with the guys and the whiskey flask was passed around several times.

They were even inside the shelter and for a minute it was like a horror movie scene. I’m not well versed at bird i.d. so not sure what they were but it was pretty intense for a moment. I noted when using the privy that strangely, it was handicapped accessible and even had a wheelchair ramp despite, I'm guessing, most of this trail being pretty darn inaccessible to a wheelchair. I met another hiker today that I’d met previously. I don’t remember her name but she was a cute kid with dreds. She reminded me that we met at the shelter after Duncannon PA when she was hiking with her uncle and Spench and Wizard. I passed a helicopter landing pad in an open area today. If you needed an emergency extraction this is where it could happen. The shelter today was not so far off trail and although there was another group of guys already there, there was still plenty of room for all of us.

I stopped at Russell Field Shelter for a snack and then at the southern most shelter in the Smokies, Mollies Ridge Shelter for lunch. It was mostly just forest walking today with glimpses of the mountains and valleys through the trees. I bet these are views you don’t get during the growing season when the trees are leafed out. We traversed over a mountain called Devils Potato Patch which I was expecting to be something awful with such a name but it was surprisingly no different than any other. Made me wonder how it got its name. All along the side of the trail was rooted up today and Mudsmeller thought it was probably wild hogs. When we got to our campsite one of the hikers at the shelter last night was here and had built a nice fire. He agreed with Mudsmeller about the hogs and told us the park was hunting them to try and eradicate this non native species from the park. We certainly witnessed the damage they can do today.

(Though I probably would have in warmer temperatures.) Anyways, I’m a little over 50+ miles north of Winding Stair Gap and felt a little heartbroken with my decision this morning to stop hiking when I got to the Dam. If the nights were a bit warmer I feel like I could have just slowed down and easily made it to Franklin with this head cold, but my thinking is, a head cold with the forecast of cold weather and possible rain on Saturday are not a good mix.

We never actually walked the trail together because we have different paces, but it was always great to see them at a break or at camp. As I got to know them better it became apparent that we had much more in common than just the fact that we have hiked a parallel hike this year. Well, there was a fork in the trail for us today as they continue on their quest to reach Springer Mountain and I wish them safe travels and happy trails. I hope we can hike together again next year as we both finish the trail, NY to ME. It was a great sunny day and pretty much all down hill for my exit out of the Smokies. I did stop at the Shuckstack fire tower and pushed through my fear of heights to climb to the top. It was a fitting end to this section to see the fantastic views of the Smokies from where I’d come and Lake Fontana where I was headed. I did meet 2 friendly guys, George and Boo, heading up to the Smokies who it turns out are friends with the county extension agent at the farmers market I’m involved with back home. They rolled around with laughter at the thought of me using the nickname they had given him and told me to use it when I see him again at the farmers market. They were hoping for snow and I bet they will see some on Saturday. As I walked across the Dam I could see Mr N in our truck driving towards me and I choked up as he stopped to pick me up and gave me a big hug right in the middle of the no parking zone.
