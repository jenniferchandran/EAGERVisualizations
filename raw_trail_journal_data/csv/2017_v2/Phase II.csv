Phase II,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559559,"Decided to start here instead of Atkins,VA due to the weather forecast of temps in the 20's with winds of 35-40 and gusts over 50 mph. My brother Wendell dropped me of at 12:30 andI had 'boots on the ground'! Waves of wind,rain and sleet to the shelter. Some green tunnels but no rocks on the path. Arrived at the sh ~ 1830. Didn't stop much due to the wx conditions. Didn't want to do that many miles to start out but wanted to get there before dark. Doc & Tunes were there, had seen them when I started, also two other thru hikers but was room for me. Was good to be back on the trail again.","Bland, VA at VA 612

Phase II,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559561,"Wind was howling all night. Tucked in my 20* down bag ~ 20:00 last night and didn't come out till 08:00 this morning. Temp was 30* and a dusting of snow covered the area. Slow getting moving as I planned on a short day. Mostly ridge walking and around some hollows. Wind and freezing drizzle came in waves until late afternoon. Walked .5mi to Trents grocery for a late lunch and chatted with the locals for a couple hrs. Called a hostel to get a ride there - 6 min by car but 1.5 hr walk. Mongo is just getting established and since the trail guides have his number wrong and address to get there way off, he's having a slow start. This place is an old church that he is fixing up. We talked for hours about lots of things. He's had a rough history but has turned his life around and wants to help others. Space heaters are the heat source which were good for the space within a 4' area. But I was inside from the wind for the night. Supposed to warm up to reasonable temps tomorrow!","Jenny Knob Sh

Phase II,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559563,"Took my time this morning, determined to stick with short days for a while. Mongo drove me to Dismal Falls so I could see it without having to hike the .6 mi from the A.T. this morning. Then he dropped me off where I got off yesterday. Perfect day for hiking. Sun for the first time since I started, and warming up fast. Plus most of the path was green tunnels - this is when the Rhododendrons on both sides of the trail form an arch over the top and meet. Started ~ 09:00 and got to the sh ~ 13:30. The path was like a walk in the park. Minor elevation changes and plenty of water sources as it followed Dismal creek for most of the time with branches from the mountains flowing into it. Good water! Ate lunch and could have kept going the 7.2 mi to the Woods Hole Hostel but hung out here for the night. Will bypass the hostel tomorrow and go to the next sh 9.5 mi. Only me in the sh tonight, two others hung their hammocks out of sight. Think a lot of hikers bypass this up due to the hostel further on and perhaps with the history here of the 1981 double murders. The killer has since died.","Lickskillet Hostel

Long climb first thing - went from 2600' to 4000' in ~ 3mi. Not bad after that. Didn't take long to warm up, and strip down to a tee shirt and shorts. With not leaves on the trees yet, need to use sun screen. already my neck and calves have burned some. Cell service has not been good since I started. At a 4000' overlook there were at least 5 comms towers but I had no or little signal ... thanks AT&T!","Wapiti Sh

Phase II,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559566,"Docs Knob was a nice sh with rhododendrens facing the open side. It was built and maintained by the Roanoke A.T. Club. A couple good views today. Hiked with Jeff & John the past couple days - (they were the hammockers). They're from FL on a 70 mi section. The first 6 mi was nice but coming down off the myn from ~ 3800' to 1300' in ~ 3 mi was tough. Got a ride to the hostel from John, who had a car parked near town (Pearisburg)This hostel is new this year. The owner Peppa - 'Dr. Peppa' and 2016 thru hiker Natural are very nice people. Peppa knew very little about the trail and at Natural's suggestion, they decided to open a hostel since it is within a mile from the A.T. There is a bunkroom that has 16 bunks. And a mobile home that has the 'home' services. Got here ~ 14:30 and wasn't long before I had a much needed shower and clean clothes. Went to DQ for late lunch and Hardees later for supper.

Long 6 mi climb to the top of Peters mtn but had a lot of switchbacks so wasn't too bad. It also circled arouns a landfill which made me want to walk a bit faster. This section will soon be relocated. At the top just before the Ricefield sh the fog lifted and there were some awesome views to the north. This is a long stretch where it is ridge walking and so at least 10 mi with no water source. Plus the next sh is closed off due to the hazzard of dead trees falling ... from the gypsy moth damage. Was thinking about making it to the 'Captains"" place today but that would have made it a 20 mi day and I'm not ready for that yet. After ~ 12 mi I was getting tired and looking for a place to camp was not east due to all the dead trees in the area. Finally found a spot where I felt safe from falling limbs a pitch my tent. Water was low so conserved enough to have a good drink in the AM. Should be a good water source in ~ 5 miles.","Angels Rest Hiker's Haven

Got to the 'Captains"" place in time to take lunch. To get there you have to use a zip line to cross a ~ 20' wide and ~ 5' deep stream. I had to experience this. He greeted me, as I was unhooking myself and my pack, and welcomed me to his place. Offered me a cold soda and we chatted for quite a while. He allows hikers to camp in his yard. The climb up the next mtn was tough - almost straight up with no switchbacks. I stopped at Baily Gap sh to rest, then continued on to Wind Rock overlook. But a couple miles before I saw smoke down below me that looked like a forest fire was raging. Then the wind shifted up the mtn to me. I continued a bit faster so hopefully I'd get past it. There was a road ~ 1.5 mi ahead I could get off trail if I had to. Finally got to Wind Rock and saw a forest ranger sitting on the rock ledge talking on two handhelds. Sat down beside him and realized he was directing a controlled burn on the mtn below. He was the 'Fire Boss' and had the perfect view of the burn. John was very nice and we chatted for a couple hours until nightfall. He was also directing helecopters as they were the main tools for starting and containing the burns.

Got my first shower in 5 days and washed my few clothes. Pat hangs out here a provides shuttles to the local grocer and other places. The grill has a grill so first trip there Spanky bought the pizza and I got a 6 pack of lager. Second trip I got a 1/2 lb burger and fries, and re-supplied for a couple days.

I said I'll put some gas in it - he said ""don't have to ... I own the gas station"". Went to the Buchannon Grill - this place is a throwback to the 50's and 60's. A long counter that angles, with pedestal seats. And old 45 rpm juke box and two old 'ice chest soda coolers. Got a burger and fries and fresh brewed sweet tea. Yummm!

There is also a library there and I wanted to transfer all my pics from my phone and camera to a jump drive to free up memory. Also needed to charge the phone and bettery backup. The past few days the trail either crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway, paralleled, drifted away for miles and then came back. And will do this until Waynesboro and then the same in the SNP until Front Royal, VA.

Both ppl I called were already out on runs and one said he could come by ~ 1600 if I still needed a ride. The motel clerk said he knew someone and called for me.

Plan is to re-supply in Waynesboro and grab a much needed shower. At Rockfish Gap the path comes out on the BRP with US 250 under the bridge. I-64 is also close by. Waynesboro is 4 mile away and is a designated A.T. trail town so local folks there welcome ppl who trek this famous foot path from Maine to Georgia. There is also a nice list of volunteer trail angels who are willing to come and pick us up and take us to town or back to the trail. I was able to contact 'Cindy' and she came and took me to the motel I was staying at. Real nice! I offered to pay for gas but she wouldn't take anything. So I said I'll pay it forward. Was too early for check in so walked to Hardee's for lunch. Was then able to check in early and received a 'hiker's discount'. Most hotel's along the trail and especially 'trail communities' give hikers a discounted rate. Went to the library ~ 5 blocks away and updated some of my online journal, then to WM to get food for the next few days. Watching the weather on TV the forecast was calling for a system dumping 2 - 4"" of rain and cooler temps. Been there and don't care to be in that situation. So thought I'd text my cousin (Debby) to see if she was still at work in Charlottsville ~ 30 mi away. She also lives ~ 15 miles from where my car is parked at my brother's (Wendell) place (second home). She was and soon was heading my way. Since I had already paid for my room I suggested to the motel clerk to 'pay it forward' as I hadn't slept in the bed nor taken a shower yet. She agreed that another hiker will most likely show up. Debby took me for supper then to my brother's place. He lives in PA so wasn't there, but I have access to the house. Later called the hotel to apologize for not leaving a tip and she said not to worry since a tired hiker had already taken my room and was very appreciative of someone 'paying it forward', and would probably leave a generous tip. Nice! Good feeling. With all that occurred today - ride to town, cousin coming to get me, hiker getting a free room ... just feel fortunate to experience all things nice today.

There are people around the trail who take the time to offer help when all you have is being carried on your back and sometimes far away from home. I take my time as the ups and downs are nothing like the past few weeks. I have no problem climbing now. If I stop it's because I want to take in the views  or take a break on my terms ... not to catch my breath. The day is sunny and warming up. Though the path skirts and crosses the Skyline Drive many times but the best views are on the trail were few 'car' ppl get to see. I find myself smiling as I walk the path today. The first few weeks were tough physically and mentally. I had to stop many times as my legs seemed to give up and my lungs and heart pounding trying to climb up the steep path. And there wasn't anyone around to push me or take those steps for me. Either I keep going or turn around. The top of the mountain will only come if I keep taking that next step forward. After a couple weeks and a couple hundred miles I found myself not dreading those climbs. Smiling that I know how these 320 miles affected and changed me. Sort of like a confidence course. And thinking about all those trail angels who helped me in so many different ways.
