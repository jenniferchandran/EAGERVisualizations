Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574611,"After a couple days of scrambling for supplies (food and stuff sacks mostly), physically preparing (cut my fingernails, saw my PT one more time) and mentally freaking out, I think I'm ready.My Ursack (animal proof bag) is loaded with 5 days of food. I will have a box waiting for me at a store by the AT Metro North Station and a box in Becket, MA. On the move resupply between them as well as a couple zero days planned. Currently waiting for water proofing to dry before packing everything up. Not much left to do but eat a good dinner.Cheers.",,View Entry,"Aug 09, Wed",0
Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574745,"This morning started early. Well...city early. Out of bed and in the shower by 7, on a train at 8...which barely got me to Grand Central to catch my preferred train up to Peekskill, NY around 10:30am.
From there, I walked to the Camp Smith Trail (aptly named for the military camp it runs along) and started my hike along blue blazes. 
**For friends and family members that don't have context for this, blazes are the markings on trees or rocks used to tell you where the trail is. On the AT, the markings are white. Along the 2000+ miles, there are ocassional places to go off trail to see something cool. These are often Blue. Why Blue? Who knows.
So, the Camp Smith trail is part of an AT Blue Blaze (as well as it's own thing). It's peak is called Anthony's Nose. It overlooks the Hudson directly across from Bear Mountain. On a blue bird day like today, the view was gorgeous. 
Past the Nose, it was another 0.6 miles until I hit my first white blaze signifying I had finally reached the official beginning of my AT journey. Roughly 5 miles further (and many ups and downs), I hit another Blue Blaze taking me to my first overnight location. 
After a cold shower, an entire box of couscous, some amusing conversation, and several games of in-hand solitaire, I'm tucked into my hammock and likely drifting off to sleep with darkness only recently falling.
My muscles are sore, but they're ready for more. ","Brooklyn, NY

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574856,"Today started great. Woke up around 5, slept for a couple more hours, started packing up around 7 and out on the trail at 8:15. I had decided last night that I would do the 12 + about a mile of Blue blaze to Fahnestock instead of pushing ahead to the next shelter. When I put my pack on, it felt great. I don't know if I fit it better or what, but I was ready to seize the day. 
At each road crossing, I stopped to eat a snack and check my location. On two separate ocassions, I saw the same woman walking different large dogs. I also had a nice couple roll down a dirt road ask me if I needed anything. I busted thru 8 miles before lunch and knew that I had 4 more before my blaze to the park.
Here's the thing about blazes: sometimes they're well marked. And sometimes they're not. And almost anything off the AT that's not the AT is blue...
So when I started reading signs for the park and the instructions were ""Follow the AT 1.5 more miles then take the blue blaze"", I didn't hesitate to take the first one I found. Blinded by excitement and the thought of a sports drink...or really anything cold and flavored...I went the wrong way. For probably a mile and a half. And then had to come back. By the time that I was back on the AT, I was mentally devestated.  I knew I didn't have far to go, but I was almost out of water. And I couldn't make myself eat another snack bar for energy. So I trudged along. Slowly.
When I finally hit the RIGHT blue blaze, I could think of nothing other than the warm camp shower waiting on the other side. I go to the park, set up my hammock, and walked to the shower. That they were locking for the night. I asked about others and they said ""Oh, they're up across the road - where to AT camp sites are.""
...
I went back to my site, packed my things back up, and crossed my fingers that the rain would hold off long enough to get settled in for the night. 
As I was setting my hammock up...again...an older man walked into the camp area. He said hello. He asked if I'd eated. He asked if I'd like some dinner. He told me his campsite number and said he'd make me some ham and eggs. He walked away and I started to cry.
After all the ups and downs of my second day, I had my first instance of Trail Magic*. The man's name is Joe. He lives in Yonkers and he has been coming to this campsite every other week, 7 times a year, to feed AT hikers. I had a great conversation with him, 2 hikers from London, and 1 from Canada. He's promised to make is breakfast tomorrow as well. 
Now I'm hunkered down in my hammock, rain pouring on top of me, and hoping I won't get woken up due to a rain fly malfunction. But I had an amazing sandwich, some surprise shrimp scampi from the site next to Joe's, and 2 glasses of Pepsi.  I'm sure I will sleep well barring disaster.
Til next time...

*Trail Magic: Anything that happens along the trail that you didn't expect and helps to make your day better. Ex: Water bottles left in a cooler at a road crossing, Finding a supply left at a shelter that you really need, Someone offering food/shelter/help just because they can.","Greymoor Spiritual Center

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574929,"Didn't sleep great but nothing got wet. I'll place blame on the super delicious Pepsi. Up early to pack and try to keep things dry.  Joe made another 3 egg sandwich (on white bread) and I was off.The ground everwhere was wet, so going was a little bit slow from time to time. Slipped going downhill 3 times. The nice thing about having a pack on your back is that it helps protect you.Started getting a shin splint on my right shin. Will be sleeping with an Icy Hot patch on it tonight. All other leg muscles are just tired. I think I have to find a way to ditch some pack weight...and I'm about to get a resupply the day after tomorrow. Guess I have to eat more.Just did the math on average miles per day for the rest of the trip. Lucky 13. A day off in Kent coming up Wednesday.So tired.

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575045,"I have officially adopted the trail name* of Brooklyn, which was started by one of the first people I met my first night out. Simple and fitting, at least for now.I don't know if it was because I had 2 nights of only ok sleep or what, but I slept SO WELL last night. Granted, I also slept a little too long (shocker, I know). Didn't crawl out of my hammock until 8am. 4 of the others that stayed were already gone and a German I've run into a couple of times (who goes by Firefly) was packing up. I ended up chatting for a little over an hour with a guy from Tennessee. He'd just spent 3 days in the city so it was easy to make conversation from there. But it meant that I didn't start walking until 10am. Yikes! I didn't have a huge day planned, but I needed to get to Pawling in time to pick up a resupply box by 5pm. This section was pretty easy. A little bit of of casual up and down and some really excellent views (pictures to come later). I did hit my first bit of trail next to farm land which meant A LOT of grass. Have I mentioned that I am mildly terrified of ticks?? Not so fun mentally.However, the last half mile or so was this huge walking bridge thru cattails and wildflowers. It even has spots to sit with very nicely made wooden chairs and benches. Whoever did that is my hero. Also pictures to come - I probably took more than was warranted. And at the end of it -the Appalachian Trail train station (**Nicole - we TOTALLY could have gotten you on a train home :-)I had mailed ahead a box to a Landscaping Center that is literally right next door. It was about 3:30, so I went in, got that, and decided to also use their indoor shower (for a $5 charge...which is totally fine to me due to hot water, privacy, and the fact that they do free mail drops). I must say that the thing I am discovering I need more than anything is a shower. I will walk extra if I know that I can start ""fresh"" even if my clothes aren't. It may also be that it's the only way I can do a sufficient tick check. ANYWAY - I got out of the shower to find a group of 3 SOBO** hikers outside. We started to chat. They were headed into Brooklyn for a couple days so I recommended a couple things - namely the beach. During that, a section hiker I met last night (who is from Ohio and goes by Ten Steps) showed up and offered us a ride to the deli 0.5 down the street where we can camp overnight for $2. His story and how he has his car is a longer story for another time. Needless to say, we jumped at the opportunity to not walk down the highway.So now I'm hanging between the train tracks and a highway. The opposite from the silence of last night, but I think I'll be ok. Had dinner (a box of couscous, a Crunch ice cream bar, a Mint Chocolate Cliff bar, and a Landshark Lager) some good conversation with a couple more SOBOs as well as Ten Steps. We tried to fix a tent, I discovered what will likely be my next pricey hiking purchase (a new sleeping bag), and I made friends with a dog (another shocker) called Luna.My legs feel ok - more icy hot tonight, but on my calves this time. If tomorrow goes well, I think i will officially be a day ahead of schedule which bodes well for a Zero Day*** I'm very excited for in Massachusetts.Until next time...*Trail name - Many, if not all, people that thru and section hike the trail adopt a name other than their given name. Ideally it is something that helps to identify them and is less repeatable than a ""normal"" name. It can also change or morph over time.**SOBO - Southbound. (NOBO = Northbound)***Zero Day - a day in which you hike no miles.","Morgan Stewart Shelter
",Tony's Deli,"Aug 13, Sun",11
Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575158,"In case you were wondering: trains are loud. All the time. Especially when you're trying to sleep.I got about 5 or 6 hours total. We were all up around 6:30 - packing, getting delicious bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches from the deli, and hit the trail by 8. Ten Steps drove me back up the road to the trail head (no one wants to do an extra 0.5 when you're already in for a long day) and I was off.The dew was sparkling on the grass of the two (maybe it was 3) cow pastures at the top of the day. There were makeshift ladders for hikers to climb up and over the fences. I wish I'd taken a picture with my phone, but I guess you're just going to have to wait. Thankfully the SOBOs I'd met yesterday were talking about this piece, so I kept my pant legs zipped on thru the morning. (You know, that whole tick thing) Some really great views and a pretty mellow start that even included a trail magic rubbermaid container of gallons of water for hikers. (Thankfully, I'd gotten my water from the spigot at the deli)After the pastures, it was back into the woods. And suddenly I was surrounded by gnats. What felt like a swarm. Constantly. For the majority of the next 4 miles. When I stopped for my morning snack at the next shelter up the trail, they left briefly. As I was deciding what to eat (2 packets of blueberries and cream oatmeal and a pie bar), a middle aged man came off the trail, also northbound. After exchanging the normal pleasantries, he said ""Man, how about those gnats, huh?"" Glad to know it wasn't just me. Flip (the man) and I chatted while eating our snacks - he's still testing out gear on short trips and hoping to do the trail in 2 chunks over the next 2 summers. I convinced him to look into getting a hammock and he took off to meet his wife who was picking him up at the next road.The next chunk of the day was pretty easy - mostly flat or downs. And my first dip into CT. Ten Mile River runs along the trail for a bit and looks awesome. There's a newer shelter near the river where I stopped for lunch (a pita pocket with a packet of lemon pepper tuna and a Cliff bar). As I continued to fend off gnats, eat my food, and scan the visitor log book, I started getting the sense that I was in a place that could easily be the beginning of a bad horror movie.-The clouds were dark and looming overhead as we zoom in on a lone hiker. The girl hears a branch snap in the distance and looks up from her lunch. Creepy underscore music happens here and we see eyes flash in the woods behind the cabin-You get the idea. It had a kind of Blair Witch feeling to it. Too bad really - otherwise a very nice spot. Moving on, CT in general started to have that feeling. Lots of strangely bent trees, spots that have caught on fire, and general creepiness. Hard to explain. Not sure if I will have many photos. I was still being pursued by a swarm of gnats.The trail goes over the NY/CT line a few times. My goal was to get myself squarely in CT before stopping for the day. This involved a mountain. The Schaghticoke Mountain - named for the Native Americans who also have a reservation encompassing said mountain. It is a long, slow, upward trek. Especially when you're starting it around 3:30pm. The views from the top were worth it, but my legs are not happy about the day.A couple miles past the final switch into CT is the Schaghticoke Campsite. It's small, uphill about 0.2, following a very active stream. There are only 4 tent sites but they're all decent sized. It's me and a few people who I don't believe are AT hikers. The best thing about spots like this is it takes some doing to get here. Thus allieviating my other general fear of serial killers. However, most tent sites in CT have bear boxes due to black bear sightings. And this activates my fear of bears. Mostly because the signage on a bear box boils down to ""Put all your things here in that smell edible. Check all your things. Choose wisely. Do not screw up."" I guess you win some, you lose some.Sleep now, into Kent tomorrow on an almost zero day - real food, rest, and reevaluating where I want to stop over the next few days.Until next time...","Tony's Deli

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575267,"Woke up around 6am to the soothing sounds of rain above my head. Glad I've started defaulting to putting the rain fly on every night. Slept a couple more hours, crawled out around 8 and took my time getting ready. No rush today - the goal was Kent, CT a mere 4 miles away.Due to the rain, lots of wet rocks on the trail again. No falls this time. Lots of slips. Took my time on a lot of downhill chunks to make sure I didn't do anything stupid. And to try to go easy on my still sore shins.Made it into Kent around noon, right behind another pair of NOBOs. Heading down the main drag, trying to decide what non-trail food I wanted to eat, I came across Uconn (the dude I chatted with a couple mornings back) sitting outside a coffeeshop. After catching up on the last couple days, we decided to find food and try to secure a place to crash in town instead of pushing on 7 more miles (spoiler alert - Kent is expensive and not very big).Quick recap of time in town: Had an awesome burger with avocado and chipolte mayo sauce; did a tiny resupply and found another NOBO by the name of Lakes; took hot showers at Kent's new hiker welcome station (many locals very excited about it being used); did a team load of laundry; tried to find an Air BnB and failed; coffee shop; liquor store; back out.We decided to backtrack to the nearest shelter - 0.3 on the trail and uphill all the way. Lakes (a fellow solo NOBO chick) and I set up camp, cracked open a couple Sixpoint Crisps, and headed over to the shelter to hang out for a while. In the end, 5 of us (4 NOBOs and 1 SOBO in a kilt) stayed up a little too late.I should have done some planning and was kind of hoping for a bed, but this option was certainly more what this adventure is about. I haven't gotten a lot of sleep (even though it could have been 8 hrs if I'd been able to), but my shins are feeling better, and I just watched the woods turn from black and white to full color. Might kick it with Lakes on the trail today, might not. At the very least, may have found a new adventure cohort for the future.Til later...","Schaghticoke Campsite

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575404,"Lakes and I started out a little behind schedule this morning. 9am off the camp site (it's harder to pack up and go in the morning when people are up and chatty). We had 17.3 miles in our sights and it was a blue bird day.Coming down from our 0.3 the wrong way, we hit the road and started off strong across a field and some flats. In no time, we were headed up again, just like every day...It's nice to be able to hike with someone. Even nicer when you quickly discover you have a fair amount in common. There were some nice stretches of flats throughout the day so we had a few hours to chat about everything from families to places we've traveled to years spent playing softball growing up. However, anytime the terrain started to go up, most talking stopped and we worked our way slowly over rocks, up steep inclines, and thru switchback after switchback. Around 2pm, we found ourselves near another river. Lakes has been battling poison ivy so we stopped for her to apply some more medicine and put our feet in the water. If we'd had the time, that strecth would be a great spot for a near zero day. Alas - onward. We crashed thru another 1.5 to a shelter where we were able to do a little work rolling muscles out on the bottoms of our feet - Lakes with a bouncy ball (which I think I need to look into) and me with my tennis ball. Around this point, we decided we weren't doing our full 17, but instead shooting for a tent site which would put us around 14 for the day - with a little blue blaze excitement added in.We'd been informed by one of our SOBO cohorts last evening that when we got to Cornwall Bridge, we would find a blue blaze to go down to the Package Store. Signing the register granted you a free beer. We stashed our bags behind some rocks up the train a ways and headed down. And then promptly turned left instead of right to go to the Citgo for soda, ice cream, and gas station breakfast food (pop tarts for me, crossoints for her). Back up the hill - super easy without our packs - and then another couple of miles to our campsite for the night. All in all, a good day. My pain has shifted from my shins up to my knees - all this up and down (and with extra weight) is not something they are used to. Ibuprofen tonight and tomorrow and we will see what happens.","Mt Algo Shelter

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575408,"Day 2 on the trail with Lakes. Felt like a lot of uphill today. On the trail at 8:15. Lakes took the lead and it felt like we were two ends of a slinky. She would get pretty far ahead during uphill sections and I could catch up during flatter parts or when she stopped for a breather.Today we had 2 goals: make it into Falls Village, CT for a cold shower and a soda. And get over Mt. Prospect before stopping for the day. We accomplished both.Let's pause here and acknowledge that ever hiker has their things they cannot pass up or go without. I believe I have already stated that showers are one of mine. This is something Lakes and I agree on wholeheartedly. We would walk further out of our way if we know there is a shower involved. It doesn't matter that, at most, you get to feel that clean for an overnight. Even an hour of feeling that good and being able to scrub off a layer of dirt is totally worth it.Most places that have showers have enclosed spaces for them. In Falls River, however, it was a spigot on the side of a work shed for a power plant. No privacy. In fact, near a fairly well travelled road for the location. So - not a full super exciting shower, but still down to underwear and able to wash out a shirt and my bandana.Also found a really great hiker stash at the spigot. I scored a tiny recharger (a little bit bigger than a lighter) and a small dry bag. Rolled out our feet, went to the Package Store (which we learned today means liquor store...silly New Englanders) for a soda (Lakes' first experience with Stewart's Soda) and some charge on the phones. And at 4:30, we headed out to conquer our last task of the day - Mt. Prospect. He's a slow lazy kind of mountain. The up stretches out longer than you want, but it's not full of rocky trail like so many others. Around 5:30 we were up and by 6:15 we had chosen our home for the night. Tomorrow wants to be a very big day - 17 miles and a lot of elevation change. No in-town diatractions, just walking. However, the radar also looks like rain. We'll see what we can jam out. We have a day in Great Barrington in our sights for Saturday if everything works out.The pain came and went a lot today. Transferred back to my right shin when we hit pavement in Falls River. Sticking with Ibuprpfen, more Icy Hot tonight, hoping to get a basic knee brace in GB on Saturday, and a down day to let things calm themselves.Keep your fingers crossed - we're hoping to accomplish a lot in the next 48 hours.","Ceasar Brook Campsite

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575488,"Woke up this morning to rain overhead. Nothing terrible but enough to keep me in my hammock longer than I should have been.I also packed up while in my hammock - that's a first for this trip. Not the easiest, but with the gear sling under my hammock it's not terrible.Parted ways with Lakes today. Hopefully we'll catch each other once more at Upper Goose Pond, but who knows - anything can happen. Hit the trail solo at 10am (wicked late) and felt like I was racing the rain all day. I didn't buy much in the way of legit rain protection (I have no rain cover for my bag, I'm using a garbage bag for a liner inside my bag, but my stuff sacks for my hammock and sleeping bag are both somewhat inherently rain proof as well as sprayed down with rain proofing) so I just kept my fingers crossed for the day. The liquid was definitely hanging in the air - any time I got a peek off a ridgeline, there wasn't much to see in the distance. I stopped just before Bear Mountain to eat a late lunch and ended up chatting with someone whose brother started working at The Huntington (as overhire) this summer - crazy small world even out here. Rain started spitting as I got going again - I practically ran the 0.9mi to the top and picked my way back down as quickly as possible. Thankfully the trail out here has a pretty dense canopy when you're off the peaks. It was certainly raining but I didn't get hit too badly. Got to the site I was shooting for and set up in record time, just beating a set of downpours. Had dinner (dehydrated Pad Thai that was better than I expected) and have been planning out my next few days. Pending any unforseen disaster, I am right on track for where I want to be. And will even potentially sleep in a bed tomorrow night. (CRAZY)My knees are still not crazy about what I'm making them do, but they're getting used to it. And no shin splints - likely because I kept the Icy Hot patch on for my 8 hr day. Time to go throw my things in the old bear box, play some solitaire  (thanks Mom), and let the last of this rain storm lull me to sleep.

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575738,"Took my time getting ready this morning. Didn't really mean to, but time just kept moving on ahead. Filtered some water. Made some oatmeal and tea. My knees were already not super happy even before I added my pack today. Thankfully, I'm travelling pretty light coming into Great Barrington. Mount Race and Mount Everett were on the schedule for today and the elevation map especially for Everett does not look fun.Hit the trail around 9:30 and was playing my usual game of take my time up, roll harder thru flats. However, on Mt Race, at a certain point you hit a ridgeline and get to ride that for 0.6miles. On this clear morning, the view was spectacular. Green as far as the eye can see, houses and ponds below, and mountains contouring the skyline directly across. I almost wish that I'd started further south so that I could have had lunch up there. However, other things on the agenda for the day.Dropping back down between the mountains, I found a group of weekend campers leaving on a hike for the day. They ended up going the same direction as me, so about 15 minutes in, I let them pass me by. It's amazing sometimes how much quicker people can move when they're not carrying 30 extra pounds on their back... especially on this particular climb. Thankfully the Massachusetts trail workers have been able to bolt some treads into the long sheer rock faces that greet you on the south side. Without those, it would have been a totally different kind of adventure. With them, it at least took the edge off.At the top, I was able to stop and chat withe the 4 girls and older gentleman. They offered a bottle of water which I gladly took - again, having packed as light as comfortable for the day. They were all at the camp site for a family reunion. In exhanging the usual ""where are you from, how long are you out"" pleasantries, I discovered that the man spent a significant amount of time in Bloomington, IL and one of the girls lives in Brooklyn - in my neighborhood. Tiny, tiny world. They went back down to their family, and I stayed a bit longer to chat with a couple thru hikers I'd seen all morning. After a quick lunch, it was time to head down. Ran into Lakes and stopped to chat for a bit. The north side of the mountain wasn't quite as bad as the south, but it just kept going .... about halfway down was a parkinglot for a park entrance. Jugs of water were chained to a picnic table and labeled ""WATER FOR THRU HIKERS"". Trail angels. Finished the water I had and refilled. Down more mountain. By the bottom, my knees had really had it. Stopped for a breather and to take some Ibuprofen. Lakes caught up just as I was getting going again. We were both feeling pretty good about the day. There had been a sign halfway down the last pitch giving me a distance of 4 more miles and her a distance of 9.5. Both totally doable. We started jamming thru some flat parts, got to the end of a particularly buggy swampy area and found another stash of hiker water. Western Massachusetts knows the way to my heart.At that point, we were starting to feel like we should be coming up on my goal of Route 7 to get into Great Barrington. We left the water station and found ourselves in another parking area. 2 people were getting out of their car ""Hey! You guys want some tomatoes?"" Lakes turned around with delight ""YES."" Very rarely out here are we going to say no to anything, especially food. The couple poured some cherry tomatoes into a couple brown paper sacks ""We just came from the farmers market. Everyone loves these little ones - eat them like candy."" We ask what road we're on. It's not what we were hoping for. But we start munching on cherry tomatoes and head on down the trail. (I still don't love tomatoes but, for the record, these were pretty spectacular). Onward thru more field until we finally stop to check our maps. That sign we'd seen - old. The mileage on it - off by 3-4 miles. Damn. Keep moving. More field, train tracks, busy road........Busy road! We hit Route 7 to find a girl waiting to pick up her thru hiking boyfriend. She have us ziplock bags with a ham sandwhich, a bag of store bought chicken salad, some string cheese, and a beer. And she gave me a ride into the shopping center. 1.5miles I don't have to walk. Errands: Laundry, small amount of groceries, find a motel. Walked too far to get to the motel and paid too much for one night...don't ask what either was. ...shower...oh man do I love a shower...Drank my beer, ate some pack weight, washed my dishes, and reevaluated my situation. During which I realized that I had walked past TWO pharmacies and did not stop. This left me without a knee brace and more importantly without new insoles for my shoes. Tomorrow just got annoying...
Rite Aid opens at 8am. Setting alarms for 6:30 and 7 so I can get up and get my ass in gear. It's 1a.5 miles back to the Rite Aid and then another 3.5 to where I got off the trail...","Laurel Ridge Campsite

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575739,"Woke up this morning feeling pretty great. Not gonna lie - the temptation to just stay in bed was strong. But I was awake before my alarms and checked out by 7:45am. Put my pack on slowly hoping that the couple going to and from their car would talk to me - no dice, not even eye contact. Started walking toward town and about 15 minutes in, heard a car pull over behind me. ""Need a ride into town?""""That would be amazing.""(Side bar: Here's my thing about getting rides out here. I'm not gonna stick my thumb out. I'm not gonna beg. In towns along the trail, people know what we're out here doing. We don't need a sign. We're wearing it on our backs.)As we dumped my pack into the back of his 4 wheel drive sports utility vehicle (with the back seats already folded down), he asked where I needed to go.""Well, ideally the Rite Aid and then back to the trail on Route 7.""He paused for a minute - I suspect for the effect - and answered ""I can do this."" We got in the car and he pulled out a tiny notebook. ""First things first, what's your trail name?""I laughed and said Brooklyn.He laughed and asked why.I said because I live there and we were off. His name is Joe. He's a retired employee of the town of Great Barrington. And now he goes out actively looking for hikers to shuttle as they come on and off the trail. Super stellar guy. I must remember to email him a thank you when I'm back.So - all that is to say I hit the trail at 8:45am with a compression knee brace and new insoles in my shoes. Add a night in a bed and some cool breezes into the mix - the day felt like a million bucks. And to think I'd been worried last night...6.5 miles and 2 mountains done by 12:30. Stopped at a really beautiful shelter for lunch with a tenting platform looking across the valley.Hit the beginning of Mt Wilcox and was warned by some weekend hikers about low to no water at the shelters up top. Stopped at a state park on the way up to fill my CamelBak (2 liters) and an additional 16oz bottle with flavoring. Back on the trail. 3pm. Hit the first shelter and passed it by - if I stopped there, my morning would start straight uphill. No fun. Keep moving. Trail passes by a lake - I think ""why didn't they tell me I could just filter water up here"" and stop to wash down my legs and soak my bandana. Get to the far shelter. No water here, but I'm prepared! I walk down, set down my bag, and pull out my trail book. I decide this site doesn't make me feel comfortable. Nothing wrong with it that I can point to, but I'm not keen on staying. It's 4.1 miles to a Shaker Campsite and it's mostly flat or down. I eat a Pro Bar and make a deal with myself - 4.1 miles in an hour and a half. I drink a sizeable amount of water and burn pine needles down the trail.Why exactly I did this to myself - who knows. If I'd seen more uphill climbs, I would have stayed put. But I know how fast I can move on flats. And I know I'm really good at short term athletic goals (thank you off season training with the cross country runners...). I also knew I was chasing daylight. I pulled out of that camp at 5:45. I don't like to be setting up camp much later than 7pm if I can help it. And I hit the campsite at 7:15pm almost on the dot. You know what feels great? Being able to hit your goals and knowing you weren't totally crazy for making the decision. What's also great - that puts me at 17.5 miles for the day. The most I will do in one stretch during this section. It's good to know I have it in me. Thru hikers out here regularly put in 20 mile days. I'll need this feeling for the next section I do...Also, this push was 120% worth it. Great site. More people. Open space. This is what I look for. There's a snack stand and a spigot coming up early tomorrow. Upper Goose Pond by early afternoon and I'll stick there for my one and only zero on Tuesday. It's gonna be good.","Great Barrington - Mountainview Motel

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575794,"Let's talk about animals out here. They have been very low on my list of things I'm worried about. As previously mentioned, I have a gear sling that keeps my stuff off the ground at night so mice can't get into it and racoons can't run away with anything. Snakes aren't great, but out here, they're usually running away when I see them. I've stopped for a pack of wild turkeys to cross the trail. I've now seen 2 bear cubs and 1 full size - all from a decent distance. No big deal. Animals are a known quantity and for the most part, I'm totally cool with them.Last night, however, I woke up around 1 or 2am to the sound of a pack of coyotes going crazy in the near distance. Not just howling, but making noises like they were maybe going after and taking down some sort of prey. They were having a good night. At an undetermined time later, I felt something stick it's nose up into my backside thru my hammock. I turned over and it was gone. Here's what I know: I hang my hammock pretty high - my backside is around 1.5 - 2 feet off the ground. I do not know if this was a dream or real. There were no track marks to be found in the morning. Who knows...Cold morning, slow day. My left shoe started breaking in its heel and slipping around. Have to investigate getting new shoes, but at this point might have to settle for finding a pair of Superfeet insoles to get me thru. The ones I tossed in yesterday weren't full inserts and started sliding forward also on my right foot. Some cool people at this shelter. It's one of the highlights on the trail. Full bunk house tonight with some weekenders from Boston around. Good people and really great company from dinner on. Made friends with a hiker from Chicago out here with his awesome pitbull mix named Rosco. Hes SoBo so I won't see him again, but I want to steal his dog... (no surprise there) Looking forward to some pancakes made by the caretakers in the morning and maybe going to find a burger down in Lee for lunch. Hopefully a swim during the day at some point as well.

It's almost vacation but at the same time, it's hard to stop thinking about what the next move is. At Upper Goose Pond Cabin, the caretakers make pancakes in the morning around 7am. It's one of the draws for hikers to stop here (aside from it being a generally awesome location, on a lake, with 12 bunks that have mattresses). I was up in the morning with the rest of the group, ate breakfast, and said goodbye to everyone from yesterday. For a few hours, it was just me and the caretakers - a nice older couple, Paul (who hiked the AT a few years ago) and Wendy. Paul found some Guerilla Glue to try to get my shoe back in working order for tomorrow. I started trying to plan out my next section, and attempted to write down all of the ""next time notes"" I have at this point.Around 11am, today's batch of hikers started to show up. A few SOBOs and then later in the day a small pack of NOBOs. Good to finally put some faces to names of people I have heard about and read in the logbooks. Played an amusing game of Monopoly in the afternoon with a couple SOBOs and won (getting all the railroads is key). Took a canoe out for a little paddle around the lake in an effort to do something active. Washed some socks... the knees are also liking the day off - life is pretty good. I'm looking at 17 miles tomorrow to land me right outside Dalton. Mostly flats, aside from the first 3-4 miles out of here.

After two mornings sleeping on a twin bed camp mattress, I was ready to get back to the woods and sleeping in my hammock. Really - I kind of love my hammock. If I could hang it in my room in the city, I would seriously consider it.But let's get into something more interesting: food. We eat a lot of it out here. And I've been having a lot of conversations about what people have gotten tired of, what they can, and what they cannot eat out here, and what they crave.Most people that I have seen out here have camping stoves and we can do a decent variety of things. But you don't want to use it for every single meal due to time and fuel usuage. It tends to be a dinner all the time and ocassional breakfast, depending on if you are a coffee/tea person.But I digress. Hot foods we all seem to eat: -Ramen-Instant mashed potatoes-Pasta sides-Rice sides-Couscous -Stuffing -Mac & Cheese-OatmealCold foods:-Packaged tuna (thankfully now Bumblebee makes flavors of tuna as well)-Deli meat/Cheese -Lots of people use tortillas. I use pita.-Peanut butter/Nutella-Various bars
Let's get real- there aren't a ton of options due to weight, shelf life, and ease. That I can make mac and cheese out here is possibility the best possible situation. I've only done it once so far (pasta is heavy), but it will definetly be on my must have list for next times. Being able to go into towns for resupplies also can be a game changer. While we know we can't walk out of the store with a lot, I have certainly found myself walking up and down every aisle to check for anything that might jump out as new and exciting. Anything that could add ""excitement"" to dinner. There is also the factor here that at the end of the day, a lot of hikers can eat just about anything. When we think about things like a package of couscous or mashed potatoes, generally we are talking about something that is support food. Not out here! We can't  (or don't want to) carry leftovers. That's ridiculous. You eat all of what you make. And that's the end of that. The more you eat, the lighter your pack is. And if you're good at it, you can plan out exactly what you need to do between resupplies.Foods that I miss:-Bananas-Cereal -Sushi-Burritos -Pizza

I don't know if it's because it's the end of August, because we're 2,000 miles up, or just because. But I am certainly happy I put a layer of Under Armour in my pack. I was wearing it at night most times during this trip, but it is now much more essential. While I am starting to be sad I won't be continuing North with some of these crazy folks, I am also excited at the prospect of going home to hoodies and hot showers soon.Been leap frogging on the trail with a group of guys for the last couple of days. Its has certainly made the walking more entertaining. For instance, I stopped last night short of Dalton but they stayed in Dalton. When I stopped at the gas station on my way out of town, they were hanging around outside. Chatted, called them lazy, and I took off. Probably an hour and a half later, they catch up to me on a climb and pass me. I catch up to them at a stream. They catch up at an outlook. I catch up to them when they accidentally get off trail for a quarter mile.... we all walk into and thru Cheshire together. They detour for donuts. I get to the shelter about 15 minutes before them. We all hang out and eat dinner together and everyone is in bed by 9 (""hiker midnight""). This is typical on the trail and is what I will look forward to again the most. It would be great to do big sections with a friend or two, but this is also in my wheelhouse of ""how to make friends"". Everyday is a race, but in the end, everyone has the same goal. 
On a more frustrating note: what I thought was a shin splint in my left shin...pretty sure it's actually just my same old ankle injury acting up now. Used my last Icy Hot this morning thinking I could get more in Dalton (but they no longer have a pharmacy in town...), so I switched to my ankle brace. Oh man. So much better. Still getting sharp pains from time to time, but I've now put the worst of everything behind me. Glad I pushed to do this last long day and got a lot behind me, but the last couple miles up here were more painful than I'd like. Tomorrow, I go up and over Greylock. A mere 8 miles to the other shelter. Will probably stop at the fancy restaurant and inn at the top for lunch. Then it's just a quick slide down into Williamstown/North Adams on Saturday morning.

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576125,"Waking up on the side of a mountain is almost as cold as going to sleep on the side of a mountain. Cozy in my hammock but takes some convincing to get up and get moving. Motivation this morning was to be able to hang out with the pack before they headed out since it would be the last time I would get the chance. Breakfast was the usual fare with a lot more banter. We also had 2 sets of mother/daughter on site with us last night and this morning. Pretty amusing addition. Best friends from college that have started meeting places with their 10-year olds to take them on adventures. They were thrilled to have a female hiker so their girls could see that we exist. When the guys departed, I dawdled for a bit longer to chat with the moms - work, gear, hiking, my cat (one of the women is a vet), their dog (who fell asleep in my lap last night). If it hadn't been for my goal of up and over a mountain, I would have walked with them for a bit, but I think I would have been a little frustrated with the pace.Finally around 9:30, I set off to get up to the top of Greylock. He's a hell of a climb. I'm certainly glad I got half of it done yesterday. Once you get a mile from the summit, you start crossing the road that people can drive up to the top on. You cross again at 0.75 and at 0.4. Each section feels straight up. When I hit the top, clouds were rolling in and it was even colder (3,400 feet up, sooo....). I took some photos and popped into the dining area for a burger. Ran into some SOBOs, shared some info, and started contemplating my plan for the day. 7 miles didn't feel like enough to sleep outside on. 10 would put me down the mountain, in a room, with a shower, and done. I watched more clouds blow around and accepted my new plan.Down, down, a little up, down, one more up to a finally overlook spot. From there, I could see my destination. Williams College buildings pop up between rows of trees and Williamstown sprawls next to it with North Adams neaby. I hear a shower calling. I stopped to make a couple calls and secure a room at a pretty reasonable rate for 2 nights. Off I go - down, down, down, down...the mountain seems to never end. Recently put in switchbacks save my knees and ankle a little bit but the pain starts to cut thru. I'm liking the idea of getting off this damn mountain more and more with every step. Suddenly,  the rocks stop and the ground levels out. Cross one road. Hit another and the white blazes throw me out into civilization. I walk past houses, see people out walking their dogs. I stop to sign my final AT register for the year. A mile and a half down Route 2 gets me to my motel. I've had a shower, 3/4 of a 12"" pizza, applied fresh Icy Hot to calm my legs, and am thinking about what I want to do tomorrow in North Adams (Mass MoCa and eat food). The mountains are outside my window and they'll stay there for a while, reminding me that there is more to accomplish. Until next time...Ps: For those that know my fears for this trip, the numbers are - Ticks: 0; Bears: 2 sightings; Serial Killers: 0 (that I know of); My back: the part of my body that held up the best.","Mark Noeppal Shelter

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601812,"I think the hardest part of section hiking I am going to continue to run into is having so many first days. Everything is difficult again. My pack feels so heavy (even when you're only out for 4 days, you're taking a similar amount of gear as you would for longer trips). My legs - oh geez. There have been moments today where all I can think is ""How did I do this before? My legs are shit. What is going on?"" Not going to the gym for weeks is what's going on...Relatedly, I rolled my shitty left ankle IN THE PARKING LOT of the TRAIN STATION. I hadn't even found the trail head yet. Honestly, I had about a minute of ""Ok, well...this sucks. I'm going home."" And then I re evaluated and decided to at least try it and see what happens. Here I am, 7 miles later, in my hammock.So, enough complaining. Let's talk trail. My most proud discovery for this trip is that the Harriman Metro-North stop has a 2mile connector trail to the AT. I thought I was going to have to do 8 or 9 just to touch white blazes. So much winning. There's a handful of sectioners out. Way too late in the game for any thru hikers in these parts. I'm ok with that. Walked up to the shelter this evening to find a dad and his maybe 10 year old son - from Brooklyn. They're sectioning south from Pawling and I was able to give them tips for their last day tomorrow including the Harriman trail secret. First interaction with the dad included him saying ""It seems like you probably know more about this stuff than I do."" Look up the Lemon Squeezer, Appalachian Trail. Check out the photos. Did that today. Want to do it again without a full pack.Contemplating changing my itinerary for the trip. Was going to only do 2 days on white blazes but thinking about ways to stick it out thru Bear Mountain and fully connect the dots to where I started last summer.

My ankle is a little bit swollen and yelps if I step in slightly the wrong way, but it's completely manageable with a little ibuprofen (which I almost didn't pack!). I decided to do tomorrow over Bear Mt and across the river. That will throw me up to where I caught the trail last year and there's a camp site just beyond it. It means I'll cut my time in the woods short by a day, but I think that's ok. I will feel better closing this gap than I would if I cut a loop back West to catch the train line I came in on.
A thought for the evening:It rained for the better part of the afternoon and I didn't care - it was actually kind of nice.I was worried no one would be at this shelter because it's an extra .6 off the AT. I have 4 companions on site tonight.I was running short on water and then consulted the NJ/NY Tail Conference map and discovered there should be a water source about a mile away on an adjacent trail. Success in a 45 minute round trip.After all of that, I sat down to watch the sun setting over the Hudson from in front of the shelter. I remember one of the guys I hiked with last summer saying ""I don't care about finding a nice place for a sun rise. Who says I'm going to get up for that. Give me a great sunset and I'll walk the extra miles in the dark."" Coming out here again solidifies for me that the AT somehow feels like home. I can't explain how or why. But things start to make sense and the trail feels like it won't steer you wrong.

The started super chill. Since I loaded up on water last night, I took my time packing up - had my oatmeal and tea. It felt grey still fron yesterday's storm, but I was hoping it would keep the fair weather hikers off Bear Mountain for a couple extra hours. I mostly got my wish. Coming up and over was a little bit jarring after 2 days in the woods, but not terrible. Saw a couple overnighters and fellow sectioners (We're easy to spot what with the giant bags and all) and chatted for a few minutes. Down the main route, around the lake, thru the zoo, and over the bridge. By 1:30p, all that I had left was a bit of a climb straight up to the blue Camp Smith trail I'd come up on last year. I decided to go up to Anthony's Nose, look back at Bear, and decide what to do.I feel a little bit eaten alive by mosquitos, have a couple hot spots on my feet, and just mildly concerned about my ankle.

The day started VERY early after staying up too late doing some last minute packing. 6a out the door, 7:15 Amtrak, 11a Lyft, 11:30 at the trailhead, walking by 12p.  Thankfully, I picked a relatively easy 10 mile chunk to start with. The highly contested Rocksylvania section won't begin until tomorrow. Today it was mostly like walking thru the midwest landscape I grew up in: corn over here, soybeans over there, completely picked over berry bushes along the fences, and a variety of animal farm noises scattered throughout. At one point, the trail went right along the cornfield edge (I don't think this was necessarily on purpose) and all I could think about were the papercut-like scratches I used to get running thru the corn fields as a kid. 
Pack feels heavy today despite all the changes I have made to lighten it up this time. Lighter sleeping bag, lighter hammock straps, no rain pants, no leatherman, no extra fuel canister. But this solar battery pack is heavier than I want it to be. And I probably over packed my food bag...and 2L of water is heavy when you have to fill it up and walk uphill most of a mile because the water at the shelter is unreliable.

Started the morning slowish. Took my time taking down camp and eating breakfast. Met a NoBo hiker named Crash and discovered we were shooting for the same shelter next. Started walking. More fields. Very thirsty. Hour and a half til a stream crossing that wasn't on the map (yayyyy!). Hour and a half back in the woods til lunch. (7 miles done by noon) More walking until an amazing overlook where we meet some day hikers with a hammock who ask a lot of questions, but not the good ones. Also see a storm in the distance. Day hikers get scared and haul ass back down. We shrug and head down a long set of stairs into Duncannon. Trail goes thru Duncannon. Got Root Beer. Met a SoBo named Legs who is hiking insane miles. Got pizza. Started the 5 mile walk to shelter. Almost all uphill for the last 3 miles. My ankle hurts. The end. (We hiked 16 miles!)
Cool story, right? I wasn't sure if I could pull off a day like today so early in this trip. 16 miles is a lot on fresh legs. But I did it. And it puts me on track for a couple chiller days and on schedule to pick up my 1 resupply box.

Changed out the patch for a new one after dinner and will take some more drugs before I go to sleep. This is the one kind of physical pain I have experienced in life that actually makes me stop.

Last time, it meant I took a Nero into Kent, CT and lazed around with some new friends. This time...I still need to try to walk 12 miles again tomorrow.

Stopped in there for lunch thinking the skies were about to open but it seemed like it all hit further down trail. Glad I decided to put my pack cover on just in case. Definitely got nailed by some good heavy rain for about a mile and a half. Lucked out in that it died off just before I got to my spot for the night. However, looks like a bit more will pass over me while I sleep. Hoping my clothes dry out. And glad I have a pair of dry socks for the morning if nothing else.

Granted, normally a section like this I would cruise thru. Today, fighting this shin splint, flats somehow exacerbate the pain more. I did decide to try my KT tape for the first time. It certainly helped. I have a feeling it is going to become the second most important piece of my med kit - right after the Icy Hot patches. 
Anyway, a couple really neat spots along the green tunnel. I had lunch at an unofficial campsite area that is covered in pine trees. A beautiful flat spot to begin with. It used to be a fire tower location but has since grown over. In the footprint of the old tower, someone has taken the time to gather up stones for a large firepit and stone chairs surrounding it. It would be a great spot to camp with a group of people.
After that, the trail passes the site of an old mining village from the 1800s. Not much to be seen right off trail,but supposedly it's haunted. Yellow Springs is the name, if you care to search the internet. Just past that is a blue blaze I was hoping to have time for. More ruins. Of the town associated with the miners and theoretically more actual ruins. The trail sign is for  ""The General"". I opted to not check it out this time around, sadly. All I could think about by that time was not walking anymore...and food - specifically mac and cheese.
Got to this really lovely site by the river. I wish it was closer to the water- I also was contemplating stopping to cold soak my feet. But I was pretty sure the 2 ladies I've been running into would be here. And I wanted to chat some more.
I was right. It's their last night on trail but I hung out with one of them- Samba- for quite a while while I made dinner and then worked on trying to loosen up my muscles. The two of them make me think that maybe one of these days I'll convince one of the other crazy ladies in my life to come out here with me. :-)  Hoping I'll catch them in the morning to say goodbye but...well, I'm really not much better at waking up early out here than I am at home. Granted, I also don't like to set an alarm unless I need to.

Shower.
Soda.
The morning started with a little re-route. Some beavers put up a damn right in the middle of the AT last year so there is an alternate now on a couple of fire roads. Added about half a mile but I didn't want to take the chance at wet shoes. Not to mention I'm starting to break some blisters.
Met a a couple of lovely volunteers at a bridge at Swatara Gap. Apparently there are some trails that they let people drive down once a year to see some historical things. Chatted for a while as I ate a quick lunch. Trail magic in the form of offering me a chair to use so I could sit in the very limited shade. 
This was followed by a pretty steep climb to get back up onto the next ridgeline for the rest of the day. A fair amount of large rocks again and LOTS of small scrubby brush and grass. Which I hate. A lot. All I can think about are ticks and snakes lying in wait. This may have been part of what caused me to do 18 miles today. I feel like I practically ran thru 5 of those miles. The last 2 however...so slow. I caved and put in my earbuds. 2 episodes of Reply All and day dreams of a shower got me thru it just barely.
Now I'm sleeping in the bunk house. Which I don't normally do. The caretaker here said ""Well,I recommend you sleep inside. We are awful close to the highway and if anything happened to you (which isn't likely, but always possible), your mother would never forgive me."" So, Mom, there are people out here that I don't even really know that look out for me.
I've caught back up to Crash and kept pace with an older guy whose name I can't remember...but is a kind of acronym for rotation of day off or something of the sort... he's a Vietnam vet.
I walked in, was offered a foot soak with epsom salts (YES PLEASE), took a delightful cold shower, did my laundry, had pizza AND coke. And a couple hours of great story swaping.

However, this time I may be paying the price in blisters.Over the last couple of days I have started to get them cropping up on my smaller toes. And I just tried to pop one on my left heel area and failed. I guess my skin is pretty tough. Which I guess is also potentially a good thing? I just did a bunch of web research about blister care. The debate of to pop or not to pop is alive and well.What this has really led me to consider is getting a ride to Cabela's tomorrow from Port Clinton. I bought a pair of Injinji socks about a month ago and decided not to wear them because they slipped around too much in these shoes. But...maybe the trick is a thin pair of those underneath my Smartwool. Guh. Double socks sounds horrible. But my feet are too narrow for just about any shoe so maybe that will help, too? Fingers crossed for some good advice tomorrow at the shop. And for a quick trip. I'll check out the pavilion in Port Clinton tomorrow but I really don't like the idea of sleeping in town. Apparently it's a half mile straight down to get into town. And also not fun to hike back out of. Such is life on the AT. So we'll see how -my feet- feel tomorrow. The rest of me is good to go....mostly...hopefully after tonight. Sleeping on a hard wooden bunk last night did a number on my lower back (sorry Doc Roy).But on the bright side, I picked up my resupply box this morning and it both did not feel excruciatingly heavy AND had stuff that I will totally continue to eat. Good job, past me. Next time, think about splitting up the athletic tape partially into the box. And adding more Icy Hot. And ibuprofen. And maybe another pair of socks. It can always find a hiker box if I don't need them. (Hiker box: a donation box commonly found in hostels, shelters, post offices, etc along the trail. Both for leaving and for finding things you need)

Or maybe it's my shoes. Or my socks. Who knows! Hiking long distances is partially about learning these things about ourselves, how to manage them, and hopefully how to prevent them next time. And the athlete in me is probably just going to keep pushing. Probably harder than I should. But...I doubt anyone reading this is surprised. And the KT tape is made of magic and at least that is keeping my muscles and ligaments working properly! And I got to jump in a very cold but ultimately refreshing swimming hole today! 
So - hopefully tonight, back in my hammock,and back with the noise of bugs instead of other hikers tossing and turning on sleeping pads, I can get some good healing sleep. As long as the gun fire in the distance doesn't get too loud...(it's middle of nowhere Pennsylvania on a lovely Saturday night...no surprise here)","501 Shelter

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620872,"It's a strange thing when you come out of the woods by a highway. Cars are louder and faster the longer you spend away from them. 
The trail crosses a number of towns. Today I passed thru Port Clinton with a visit to Hamburg for a few resupply items. Port Clinton is very tiny. I don't there there is a stop light. The important items highlighted in my guides are: the Post Office, the Candy Store, and the Hotel which is the same building as the bar and grill, and a Pavilion that thru hikers can camp at. Of course I had to stop at the candy store to get a soda. And then figure out how to get to the Cabela's followed by the Walmart and back to the trail. Normally Cabelas runs a shuttle for hikers. Sadly it has been out for repair for a while this season. So...Lyft to the rescue.After a 17 minute wait (I mean, I'm glad I could get a ride at all), a little red car pulled up and a man probably not much older than me immediately started to move his things so that I could sit in the front seat. ""I have questions. Sit up front. I want to talk to you."" Ok, sure. Apparently he grew up in Croatia and used to hike all the time but hasn't since he moved here 14 years ago. But seems to have a mild interest in the AT. At least enough interest to proceed to wait for me at cabela's, then wait for me at Walmart, and then drive me back. Which was amazing. I don't care that it was still a monetary transaction, that counts as a Trail Angel to me. Not having to do a road walk between stores and not having to call a second car...total win. In and out of town in 2 hours...and with a little more heft to my pack than I meant to. But.. I only had 3 miles left to go. So I thought it was a good occasion for an extra soda and some junk food. Oh! AND an apple (I ate one right away, too). Guys, food is heavy. And pretty much anytime you come out of town, you're going uphill. And now I'm loaded up with 5 days worth to get me to Delaware Water Gap where I may take my only true Zero of this trip. Tell me again how cool I am - because this feels pretty silly sometimes.

The Knife's Edge which is full of giant boulders on an exposed ridgeline. And then a boulder scramble coming up out of Palmerton that overlooks Leighigh Gap. I bet if you Google them you can find some photos. Nothing you see will totally do it justice. I am super thankful that I had 2 people with me. Not that any of us physically helped each other thru those sections but it was nice to know that if something were to happen, we were there for each other.
We dropped into Palmerton today. Got super luck with a hitch in and out. Had a really great bacon cheese burger and some fries. Subsequently, not really hungry when we set up camp tonight so I just ate a nutella covered pitas bread. I'm sure I'll be hungry in the morning.
We also had to walk around a Superfund site after Palmerton. Water in this area is super scarce mostly due to that, I think. There was one source that we passed today but rumor is that it's pretty contaminated and you shouldn't drink it. And this time of year, even good sources sometimes dry up. So there have been a number of road crossings with water caches from Trail Angel's. The last one we had today also had Gatorade. And hopefully the one we kick off with tomorrow will still be stocked when we get to it as well. Carrying extra water is so heavy and we've all been loading up with 3ish Liters when we walk away from a water source because it's better to carry extra than go thirsty. So...needless to say, my legs are starting to get in really good shape. But oh man, if I could just bottle sweat and drink it again, I don't think I'd have to carry any water. Keeping up with these guys is a challenge and I have been pushing. I don't think I have been this sweaty since my basketball days.
Anyway, camped at a really sweet site tonight with pine trees and pine needles covering the ground. Higher up than we have been so a nice breeze tonight. Hoping to keep going a little longer with these guys. I'm way ahead of schedule but making friends out here is also part of the adventure. I can slow down when I get to Harriman and take my time out there. (Anyone want to come hike some more reasonable days in a couple weekends?)
Alright. Time to shut down and recharge for another adventure tomorrow!
Ps medical update: feet are doing better. Blisters seem under control. Got better socks, haven't had to double. Still some small ones on my toes to deal with but not bad.
Have stopped KT taping for now. Shins seem under control (fingers crossed).

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621115,"Today was epic in so many ways.
25.1 miles walked and so many of them full of more stupid stupid rocks.
However, Luna and I had an adventure going just off trail to a run down motel (after 16 miles) where we got to fill our water bottles and take free showers. However, we also ended up witnessing a bit of an internal incredibly heated argument that may or may not have been fueled by some kind of substance abuse. We packed up quickly and hit the trail again. (We didn't fear for our safety we mostly just didn't want to be around for it. And there was an employee that was completely normal and helpful and apologetic)
Back up another mile long climb and then 8 left until our stopping point. But here's the thing about all of today. The rocks here are not big enough to walk on and cruise across. They're not small enough to ignore. And half of them are pokey side up just waiting to either try and trip you or be very uncomfortable to your feet. So the miles we slow. And we got tired really fast. There came another giant boulder scramble but not as bad as the ones we've done before. After that, some flat land and a pile of blackberry bushes which we stopped to put in a ziplock for later (they were delicious). And then to the last road crossing!...only to find the water cashe there completely empty...and each of us with only about a liter for the night and nothing else on the map for 5 miles in the morning.
So....we got a hitch from a nice guy about our age down the road to a gas station and he then came back and brought us back to the trail. 
And then another half a mile to meet back up with Skinny at the shelter. At 9pm. 
Long day. So tired. Tomorrow I actually slow down. We all go into Delaware Water Gap in the morning and then my plan is to stay the night. They will both likely hike on ahead to keep up their mileage. But there's apparently an awesome bakery and a hiker hostel that I'll stay at for sure.

That ridge runner introduced us to an awesome trail angel who has been supplying water to this section. And then we stayed after dinner talking with him until about 9p.We lost Skinny today. He decided to keep going after picking up a package at the post office. Luna and I are still here and have a new friend that will attempt to do miles with us tomorrow. A stop at the outfitter got me new insoles (Superfeet). After which, I pulled the ones out of my shoes and discovered they are SUPER flat. So hoping this helps to sort out some of the foot pain and maybe calm the shin splint that started to come back on the right side. Also new gaiters which are the brand that most thru hikers get.

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621226,"Let's talk about food. Have I done that yet? The amount of calories you have to consume out here to be able to do average to big miles is kind of crazy. Not to mention that you really need at least some of it to be NOT sugary things that just make you crash. Yesterday, we ate so much food between the amazing bakery in town and the dinner we were served. Imagine eating Thanksgiving dinner, getting seconds, and just feeling a normal kind of full. That's kind of what that was like.
Today however, we started the morning with some leftover baked goods - zucchini blueberry bread and an apple cider donut. 11 miles in (around noon), we stopped at the AMC Mohican Outfitter which runs a tiny kitchen and got bacon egg and cheese sandwiches (the size of which I would normally not feel great eating all of). We snacked a little throughout the afternoon - dried fruit, a Cliff bar. By the time we got to camp around 7:30 we were starving. We had packed out a loaf of bread from the bakery so we each had a big chunk of that with butter we snagged at lunch. While waiting for our water to boil for pasta dinners, we also devoured a small bag of homemade chips from the bakery. Then ate the pasta and mostly started to feel like we'd had enough.
Eating out here does 2 things that are great: gives you energy and makes your pack lighter. Both make you capable of doing another day.
I do have to say - I am starting to crave the things we can't get out here. And I look forward to eating sushi while I still have a hiker appetite.
In other news - I may have to finally actually slow down. Have been developing soreness in my right foot on the outside. I think it started from repetitively stepping on rocks in the same place. It has started to have more pronounced moments when I step wrong. And today, it began to feel like tendon/ligament pain. So, I told Luna I might not be able to keep up starting tomorrow. There is no reason for me to get injured out here. And while it bums me out to think about going back to being on my own, the thru hikers are starting to feel the pressure to get up north before weather starts turning. 
The rocks of Pennsylvania are behind us. And they tell us they are only bad for another 20 miles here in New Jersey. So hopefully that will help sort this out. Regardless, time to push less and start listening to my body again.","Church of the Mountain Hostel

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621326,"Here's the thing about long distance hiking - it does take a decent amount of athleticism. Thru hikers talk alot about miles and food and pack weight and pain. Walking 20+ miles a day hurts and I can now attest to that. It sounds like no matter how many times you do it, after 20 miles out here, your feet just hurt. End of story.
Section hikers don't normally do those kinds of miles. It takes time to build up the stamina of being able to even do 20ish miles a day. After these last 5 days, I know it's something I can do. Which is awesome. But I also know that next time, I need a few more days to build my feet up first. 
The pain on the outside of my foot has been getting worse. And it kind of feels like I've been walking on a bruise. We hiked into High Point State Park (NJ) today. Got a free soda for checking in at the rangers station. And then still had a climb up to the high point observation tower and down to a shelter. The rocks were BAD. I had 3 steps almost in a row that made me want to stop right there. And it takes quite a bit to make me stop. It starts to feel personal sometimes at that point. You just want to yell at the trail to let you have this thing that you want. But it's never going to let you go easy. So we got down to where the shelter turn off is and had to say goodbye.

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621335,"Today was a rollercoaster. I woke up and everything was a little bit damp. It had rained overnight and nothing really dries out in this humidity anyway. I knew the plan was to try to do 19.5 to get to the first entry to Warwick, NY. Luna was shooting to a further spot that would also get her to Warwick. We were hoping to meet up and camp at a drive in movie theater that has started catering to hikers. And be able to do a resupply at a real grocery store. 
So. I started the morning with 5 miles to a place called Secret Shelter - which is just someone's private property and he lets hikers camp there and use his outdoor shower. Those 5 miles sucked. There was nothing really remarkable about them. My foot just hurt. I couldn't get my stride. Every step felt like it was a bad idea. I probably almost stopped half a dozen times. But I really really really wanted to get to Warwick because we'd made this plan. 
I got to Secret Shelter and threw my pack down,starting to think about maybe just stopping for the day. I took my shoes and socks off. Located and used the incredibly glorious outdoor shower that was not freezing cold. And then sat for a long time trying to make a pros and cons list as to what I should do. Luna started texting me updates about what was coming next and it was a lot of flat, and boardwalks, and road walks. 
So...I decided to give it a shot. I took ibuprofen because I realized there is some swelling in my right foot. I took a CBD gummy to help me not think so much. And I put KT tape on my foot. I changed back to my Darn Tough socks because I think the Injinis I bought were actually exacerbating the pain.
After that, I packed up, popped a root beer candy in my mouth and hit the dirt again. And it was ok. It wasn't great. But it was manageable. Between the tape and the flat spots that allowed me to think about how my foot was working and not letting it just slam into the ground, it started feeling closer to normal. 
So I got thru 5 more miles. And then another 3. And then tried to race my last 6.5 down to be able to be at a farmers market by 6pm. Well...that failed and I probably pushed too hard. But I made it to the trailhead. Luna has texted me her ETA and also that maybe there was weather rolling in and of I wanted to get a room somewhere we could split it. 
I threw my pack down, so glad I was done. And then looked behind me...and saw a giant dark cloud rolling in. Long story short, thunderstorms drove us into a motel. But we both made it. We both got our miles. And we have shuttle driver that will come get us in the morning and take us to resupply as well as back to our own separate trail heads.
So. Tomorrow we really part ways. And tomorrow I either hike an easy 8 to the next shelter or I decide to go camp in town on my own and do a zero in an effort to let my foot calm down. We will see what the day brings...","High Point Shelter

After 2 weeks of non stop moving, today was the perfect day to take a break. Even though we did a nero into DWG, there's a big difference when you wake up and go to sleep in the same place. We stayed up pretty late last night. It's easier to just keep talking when you are sharing a room and suddenly you can hang out without swatting mosquitoes. Also let ourselves sleep in until 9 which was awesome. Had a quick bagel breakfast, called Mark- our shuttle driver- to come get up, and packed up. Then onto the grocery store for a quick resupply. I've decided that since I'm so far ahead I'll take my time getting back across Harriman and will plan to be home on Friday. So I only need to carry 3 dinners, 4 lunches, and 3ish days of bars. Easy peasy. And I won't be doing the giant miles so I'll probably still have leftover snacks at the end. But having a little bit extra to me just means you actually planned right. Better to carry a little extra in case of emergency.After groceries, Luna went back to the trail and I headed to the drive in. Hung out for a while being super lazy. Talked to a Nobo who was packing up to head out. Traded stories. He left and I decided to casually set my stuff up and try to decide what to do with the day. Around 2pm, I heard thunder. I don't know what it is about Warwick and storms but man they come out of nowhere. Staked my rain fly down (I always set it up with stakes in place but usually leave one flap up until I'm going to bed), tossed everything in my bag, and headed across the street to an awesome farm store and brew pub. Hung out there for lunch and a beer (New Holland Dragons Milk Spec Edition!), met the owner, chatted with a bar tender about the AT, had a couple people offer me rides. It was probably the best trail town experience I've had so far in that everyone kind of knew what I'm doing and were really interested in it. So that was cool. Got some ""office work"" done to start breaking down all of my information about this section. Charged my phone back up. And headed back to the drive in.At the drive in, I soon met the guy running the place. The first exchange we had went something like this:Him - Where ya from?Me - Originally? The middle of Illinois.Him - Yeah? Where about?Me - Peoria?Him - Huh. My dad was born there. My brother was born there. I was born outside Cleveland.Me - No. Way Him - Yeah. I grew up in South Pekin. We had a store there. One in Canton too.
Totally crazy sometimes the people you meet out here, and in general for me. I get surprised every time someone knows where I mean when I say Peoria. Maybe i should start getting less surprised. But this one really caught me off guard. Really nice guy. Very accommodating. They're trying to clear more space for more hikers next year. He's keeping track of how many come thru and he thinks he's seen 600 this season. 
My foot is feeling better after giving it a full day off. I've been told the rock section ahead is kind of intense so we'll see how far I can get tomorrow. There's a shelter really close in 5m or I can shoot for something like 13 or 15 if I'm feeling good. So we'll see. Still planning to tape it up for safety. Just need to make it a few more days...

To be vortexed - a feeling that a place keeps sucking you back in.
Warwick, NY is so far the best vortex for me. DWG had potential. And if we had let it,would have been a pretty fun vortex.
However, Warwick is easily accessible via 3 road crossings on the AT. The southern most crossing is also home to a farm stand and a hot dog stand. The northern most is also home to a creamery. These two points are 15 miles apart. 15 miles is what many hikers would consider to be an acceptable amount of ground covered in one day. Toss in a free camping spot at a drive in movie theater with a grocery store next door. Add another farm and brew pub across the street. For good measure also mix in a very willing shuttle driver and so many helpful locals. You've got yourself a really great vortex for someone like me. 
I went to sleep last night thinking I could either do a very short day and hike up 5ish miles to the next shelter. Or do 17ish miles if I was feeling good, which was my hope. I woke up this morning still not feeling like I could walk normal steps and also wary of rocks climbs and long open ridgelines I had been hearing about. It was shaping up to be another hot and humid day. I packed up and decided to walk down to a bagel shop by the grocery to test out my foot. If it felt questionable, my plan was to call Mark (who was already planning to drive me back to the trail) and tell him I'd like to slack pack for the day. (This means to leave your full pack somewhere and just take a day pack out - and get picked back up again on the other side)
I decided to slack it. And the number of times during the day that I was happy with that decision was....a lot. Started with a steep rocky climb and then the whole day was up and down, in and out of small rocks. Climbing over boulders that were more comfortable to use my hands to help brace than my poles. There is one tiny section where the trail maintainers put rebar into the rock to act as a ladder. And these long stretches of open ridgeline with no shade in the early afternoon. 
The plus to the past two days of rain is that all of the streams were flowing. So I was able to filter a full Gatorade bottles worth every 3 or 4 miles and not worry. And with ice cream calling me toward the finish line, it made for a pretty great day.
What I decided during that walk however is a little bit sad, perhaps. I'm going to pull the emergency escape hatch on my trip tomorrow. I have 11 miles to get to a train station on the west side of Harriman State Park. I sectioned last year from that point up to where I started 2 years ago. So I'm all linked up. I don't NEED to cross the park this week but I was looking forward to a few more days out. My body however is telling me it's time to rest. So, I will do the adult thing and listen to it (finally).
One more night though falling asleep to far off movie noise. It's strangely easier than the middle of nowhere noises sometimes. Easier to identify... but that's a thesis for another time.","Warwick Drive In

The weather was overcast and not too hot, so I was able to carry less water. After about 5 miles, I hit a waterfall that was tiny but very cute. And it led to my favorite part of any day - pour water over your head time. It's the best. After that, I came around a corner and scared off two cranes so I got to watch them fly. Up on a rocky outcrop, I had a hawk circling low enough that I could hear it's wings beating. And then the absolute best thing - came around a corner and startled 2 bear cubs and their young mom. They were far enough away that the Mom and 1 cub just took off. But I stopped to watch the other cub scurry up a tiny tree. Then wait. Then climb back down very slowly and find the scent to go back home. So cute. 
Around lunch however, things started to turn. If the AT was trying to suck me back in, it must have realized that I was gunning for home for real. The small but mighty climbs kept coming with steep descents following them. The sky started to turn grey and then passed into more hot beating sunlight. And by the time I got to my 2 miles of side trail, all I wanted was to be out of the woods. When you think to yourself ""It's only x more miles,"" that is when the AT will kick you in the shins. It doesn't give you anything for free. And the mile or 2 at the end of the day are almost always the worst.
But now I'm on a Metro North train heading back into the big concrete jungle. I did my miles and I'm all connected up with my previous hike(s).

Anyway. Very late start today...around 11:45 I think. Tom and I camped for the weekend near the trail and so we made a good breakfast and broke down camp and then had to find the trail. Etc etc etc. BUT still did all my miles which I take as a win. I wasn't sure if I could but a lot of southern Oregon is quite flat. So I was able to keep a pace a little bit faster than 2mph which meant I still got to camp around 5:30. Win!Legs feel tired but good. Everything is tired but good really. I've kept in shape a bit over this whole quarantine thing and did some bike rides and hikes in the last couple weeks to prepare. So this isn't awful. But putting 25ish pounds on my back is always an adjustment. Thankfully I only had to start with 3 days of food. I'll pick up a box end of day tomorrow that will be another 5 to carry me to Crater Lake.

Was starting to be worried that I was right to prepare for a very much more isolated journey. Pulled into the campsite and found 2 more pairs of people. All of us are headed north. 2 older ladies are hiking all of Oregon together so I have a suspicion that I will see them a bit more along these two weeks. I'm OK not seeing people during the day. It's weird but it's still kind of normal. But man I do like having people at the same camp spot as me. Nighttime is the time we don't really have control over.

There are nights that wish that I was a tent camper. Tonight is one of those nights. 
I often find myself walking past flat spots on trail with no trees in sight and wondering what it must be like to have that kind of freedom. Don't get me wrong, I love my hammock and I doubt that my back would be so forgiving with the rest of my choices if I also threw in sleeping on the ground. However. I have not tried it in the modern sense - aka a very good sleep pad. Perhaps I will have to soon. Let me explain. Last night, I hung my hammock for the first time in a year and did a -terrible- job. I slept ok but was slanted so that I couldn't fully stretch out (bonus - I often sleep curled up in a ball). Tonight I got to a very nice spot by a lake, hung my hammock much better, and then had to wait for the wind to calm down to be able to put up my tarp. Why tarp you ask? Well first and foremost I find the thought of sleeping exposed very uncomfortable. While I don't expect rain so much it can happen. And more than anything I just like the bit of privacy it creates. Now the added layer to this is that this particular tarp is new (half the weight of the one I've had the last three years). I'm still figuring out how best to use it. And it is quite lightweight - a bit like a sail.Now, tonight in particular, I am frustrated. My knee hurts. The campground I was hoping for has weird Covid rules. The ladies I was hoping to camp with are not to be found. And so I made a choice instead of pushing further on trail to stop and stay here. It has been a longish day. The trees are wonderfully spaced and sometimes that has to be my win. But man...thinking about being able to pitch a spot in a short amount of time and have it just be 1 thing...maybe I just need to reinvestigate my setup. Projects for later.In other news, beautiful sunset and a lake FULL of geese that just flew across in tons of different groups while I ate dinner.I think I hear a couple PCT folks setting up nearby.

In part because I really wanted to stay at the shelter site (hi, hello, PCT, could you please add shelters and privies like the AT, thanks). And in part because that would put me thru a stretch of basically no water and I really dislike dry camping. (Dry camping = staying somewhere without water nearby)SO...because I actually got up early (for me) and was back on trail by 7:45, I decided to give it a whirl. My knee was being questionable so I KT taped as best I could from their very basic instruction packet (no internet), and told myself that I'll get as far as I can get. Now, you already know how this ends because, well...I told you I did it in the title. But there is so much more to it than that!Have you ever run cross country? I didn't. But my best friends in elementary school and I used to practice with them to stay in shape for basketball. It was awful. But it did teach me to set manageable goals. Back then it was ""let's just get to that fence post. OK, now to that building. OK, now to that tree."" In hiking, there is an App that we use that is an offline map with waypoints. As long as your GPS is on, you can see how far away things are. And how much elevation gain/loss you will have. So today, I decided to test out my body on the first 5 miles to a hiker friendly campground where I could have a midmorning snack, some good water, and a bathroom. If I could make it there in 2 hours, it was game on for the day. Well that happened. And so then I just started setting a clock for myself. At about 2, i got to a spring that was supposed to have reliable water. Well...it's late August and Oregon is super dry, sooooo more like a seeping puddle. Not my idea of fun. Re-enter Brown Mt Shelter. With a water spigot. It must be filtered but it is cold and plentiful. If you read back over the last few months of comments in Guthooks, you would also see that there has been some trouble with the spigot handle going missing. So, at this point, I start conserving water. I decide I MUST make it the last 8 miles to the shelter and I also must be prepared for an outcome in which it is not there and I must cry a river of tears to sustain myself.I think it was around mile 14 when I ran into an older man hiking SOBO. I tried to ask him about the shelter. It came out as not a sentence. I asked if he knew about water at the shelter. He said ""No, I decided to bypass it."" I wanted to yell at him ""What?!? Why?!? Are you an idiot? Do you have magic water pellets?!?"" I did not say any of that. He offered that he'd heard the water was working and he passed 2 women heading there. And that he was going to the spring. I told him the spring was a puddle and wished him luck. Maybe a mile later, I saw a large brown animal coming toward me. Startled for a second, I then realized it was a friendly dog off leash who came to say hi. It's owner and I talked for a bit. When I mentioned I was headed to the shelter and worried about the water working, she said that she'd heard 2 or 3 days ago that it was. Her other dog, older and slower, leaned on my legs and then also walked between my legs as of it were saying ""just sit down. I'll carry you."" This may have been when I realized I should drink some of my stashed liter of still unopened Smart water. I parted ways with the woman and dogs and was now determined that this day would be worth it. I had around 4 miles left, mostly flat. There was 1 road roughly halfway in-between. After crossing that road, the last 1.5 miles went on forever. Were you reading during my last AT trip when I said I think anything over 20 miles just hurts? Well when it's your 3rd day on trail and you're pushing 20 miles, it feels like you're already at 25. When I saw the sign for the shelter, I could have screamed for joy. I could feel equally all 4 blisters that had been developing over the course of the day. Though strangely my knee was only tired, not throbbing with pain.When I walked up the path, I saw the two ladies from the first night. They were equally happy to see me. I said ""Please tell me the water works"". The woman I now know goes by Post said ""Yes. It is excellent. We will help you to fill up when you're ready."" I promptly gulped down the last of my Smart Water and went about my setup routine. All was right in the world.
So - the answer to the question: how do you hike a 19 mile day?Put the ONLY GOOD WATER at the end. It's like a carrot. But better.
Side note: had a lovely dinner with Post and Pegleg. We have very similar goals until I jump off at Willamette Pass. Also a deer was munching on plants very nearby during the entire time we ate. I bet she was like ""Psshhh...ONLY 19 miles? ...amateurs""
Tomorrow: Less miles, more shower.","Hyatt Lake Horse Camp

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630275,"It's weird that I would almost call today a Nero. But I got into Fish Lake around 1p. Got a soda. Found the hiker campsite. Took a shower (!) with HOT water (!!) that, according to the coin machine should have only lasted 3 minutes and instead was definitely closer to 15 (!!!). I had a burger with jalepenos and cheese and some weird secret sauce...no fries...I got a salad?...I know. It's totally weird. But sometimes I want vegetables, even when they're not really great ones. Assessed the state of my feet (not great. Really bad blistering spot from...my custom orthodics...dun dun dun!!!! [Yes, Shari, I will email ASAP!]) But the store has large moleskin blister sheets, so I tried to put in a small buffer. We'll see what happens. I charged my phone. I washed my socks. Oh man...hiker life is -exciiiiting-But here's the thing I love about places like this - they expect the hikers. And so it is also often a spot that trail angels, trail workers, or folks that just want to hear your story hang out. So today while I was eating my burger, I got to meet the guy that services that sweet sweet water pump we had at the shelter last night. He had stories and he wanted to know what my plan was and he offered up some alternate places to think about (which I will keep in mind for another time). And we touched on politics in a way that made him say, upon leaving, ""Well, sounds like I don't need to tell you to make sure you're registered to vote!"" Really cool guy. Apparently his wife is a Forest Ranger as well and man she sounds like someone I want to hang out with.
I nearly forgot that the day started off with me being the last to start walking (surprised? Didn't think so) and then getting to watch the entire family of deer, including two adorable and very skittish fawns still with their spots, eat their breakfast. And the majority of today's walk was across a giant lava flow area from...a volcano to the East of the trail whose name I don't know. But they carved the trail thru the lava flows and then dumped red rocks all along it. It's a pretty impressive piece of trail. AND Mt. McLoughlin showed up in the views today. It's a pretty one. Bare on top this late in the season and quite pointy. If I had another couple of days, I'd think about sticking around to mend my feet and then go up it. But it looks like a heck of a climb, especially with a full pack on. Will save it for another adventure.
It feels early (8p) but I'm quite tired and hoping if I get some extra sleep my body will heal itself a bit more overnight. Hoping for an earlier start tomorrow. Shooting for 13 miles and it starts with a climb - wheeeeee!","Brown Mt Shelter

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630276,"You know those National Geographic shots that zoom into a lake with a little island in the middle - fish jumping in slow motion to catch their evening snacks, dragonflies buzzing all around also in search of food. The sun just about to set and so the sky is a pinky rose graduating up to a clear blue that is slowly darkening over head? That's where I sit right now. It's a little bit chilly - I really wish I had packed a long sleeve layer, but alas...my jacket will have to do (and it has thus far). Now add into that beautiful photo: off in the distance along the side of the lake, just the black shapes of a mama bear fishing for dinner and the shadow of two cubs on the shore behind her. At least, I'm 90% certain that's what it is. I've been watching them for some time. But have no way to see them any more clearly thru the zoom on my camera, and no binoculars.
I do wish the ladies were here tonight. No idea if they went further ahead on accident or got a late start and didn't make it this far. While I'm not worried about this wildlife off in the distance, it would feel better with company - just what with this being a wilderness area and all.
Bears aside, what I was trying to get at in the beginning is that this is certainly an extraordinary spot. The park service guy I was chatting with yesterday mentioned that this lake was ""disovered"" by a guy named Waldo (he apparently did a lot of discovering in his time. Waldo Lake is further up the trail and apparently one of the clearest in the country). When they were here (1880s I think he said?), they chose a big tree to inscribe. It still stands, though mostly dead, probably in part due to the giant piece of bark they shaved off. There's a fence around it in much disrepair. A handful of trees around the campsite also look like they were inscribed in a similar manner. Its cool but also a little bit eerie with no one else here- kind of feels like a place that should be overrun with Boy Scout troops. It would be nice to share this with someone. The lack of hikers out makes this trip feel much stranger than those in the past. 
Well, still have to sleep. More miles in the morning. And I bet this lake look gorgeous during breakfast.","Fish Lake

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630311,"Today felt a little big like the AT. Up, up, down, up, down, up, down, down, down. Throw in some ridge walking and some gorgeous views. And even some cellphone service!! It was like a Christmas miracle. We all kind of know that if you get up a mountain or the right hillside, you can usually ping back onto the grid. But it's been so many days without a high point that I almost forgot to check. Nice to get a couple messages out and have pictures of my cat and tomatoes (so many tomatoes. Send me your recipes. I will be making salsa.) The only downfall of so much time up high today was that it was also sooooo exposed. And water was scarce. But all of these lakes dotted the land below...whoever made these trails really is a masochist. It's just not fair.At some point along the cliff, I met a NOBO...and his adventure cat! She was riding on top of his pack and not super thrilled with the heat either. They passed me. So it goes. A bit later another NOBO came from behind me while I was taking photos. She and I chatted for a bit and I learned she was with the guy and the cat! We lamented the heat and exposure and water. She started on ahead and we figured we'd see each other at whatever water appeared next. I finished the ridge and started the down, down, down section (which really is what my knee hates). Finally dropped into the trees. Kept checking Guthooks for a water source that had promising comments toward still existing. Turned a corner, and...tada! Friends! Sat and chatted with Mowgli (the guy) and Sunny Side Up. Sunny hiked the AT last year. They're both thinking of moving to Portland. We had things to discuss. So we sat and snacked and filtered water. It was nice. This part again felt like the before times. If I hadn't been nearing the end of a long day, daydreaming of a lake, and really not wanting to dry camp, I might have stuck it out for a few more miles with them. Instead, just a couple more miles down the trail, I turned off. Toward this gorgeous lake and the end of my day.This lake sits at the bottom of the cliff we spent so long traversing, so it felt appropriate to stop. I had a chance for a quick jump in (mostly with the hope of rinsing some salty sweat stains off) though not quite enough time for my clothes to dry...(hoping the hiker trick of putting them in my sleeping bag will help)And a group of 3 older women on a backpacking trip themselves have been lovely company from a campsite over. I expect I am going to fall asleep to the sounds of them playing cards. 
Tomorrow I have to walk out of camp with a completely full water stock. I either make the 20 mile trek straight thru to Mazama Campground just inside Crater Lake Park or get as close as I can in a day and pick up a Nero into camp on Monday. But I don't expect to see much if any water. And there is also a large burned area ahead which makes for less camping options. So...20 doesn't sound -fun- but it might be necessary. Thankfully my food bag is VERY light!It's early again (8p) but I am tired. And MUST get up early. Seriously, self, stop being such a slacker in the mornings...","Island Lake

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630312,"I know what you're thinking. Brooklyn - what the hell was the reason behind doing another big mile day? What could be SO important?
Well...for starters it was another long stretch of dry dry walking. I filled up my 2.5L of water bottles, stocked my hip pockets with snacks, and relished the fact that my food bag was delightfully lightweight. A good combo to be able to shoot far. Today took me thru a burn area - I believe from 2016? Not totally sure. Hours of walking thru black, white, and silver sticks still standing tall. Little patches of green starting to pop up. A few small purple flowers. And so much dust. I hit the burn probably around 10:30am. Being a hammock camper, there was no way I would even consider trying to find a spot to hang among toasted trees. It had an eerie beauty to it but I had to keep moving. By noon, there was still no end in site. So I stopped to let my shoes, socks, and feet dry out while I had lunch. It was starting to feel like walking on the surface of the sun. Every now and then, the trail would dip into a tiny green respite only to then spit you right back into gnarled, bent, and broken shells of a forest.Around 2pm, I stepped foot into Crater Lake National Park. Still a little burnt. And only 7 more, relatively flat, miles until the turn to the campground. I found the trail register in 2 more miles. All I wanted was real food ... and a soda (duh). I thought about stopping short and picking a nice spot as I quickly entered full forest area again. But...to what end? I was on track for 5p into camp and I could think of no reason not to. I mean, my feet hurt a little, but that's just life right now. So, I found the road, I found the campsite (which is huge and full of tourists...), and then -surprise!- i found my new friends Mowgli, Sunny Side Up, and their trusty trail cat. They had stayed around camp all day because they also wanted ""real"" food and apparently the kitchen is currently only open for dinner. So I got there right on time in fact. We sat around for far too long, was joined by another NOBO companion of theirs, and probably annoyed  handful of tourists nearby on the patio. None of us cared about our volume or the content of our conversations. The sun started to go down - we put on jackets. The restaurant started to close - we ran in to use the bathrooms. The moon started to rise - we finally made very slow moves to part ways. Sadly I will not cross paths with them again - on trail at least. They have an agenda to finish and a lot of miles to catch. But in seeing them again, we were at least able to exchange social media handles. If they decide to roll thru Portland post trail, maybe their cat (Sher Kahn..sp?) can teach Penny how to be an adventure cat (not likely).
And so, that is how a little bit of crazy, a whole lot of determination, and a voice in the back of your head saying ""Yeah, you can make it there. Why stop now?"" sometimes can really pay off. People say the trail provides. And I think all of us at dinner tonight got a little bit of what we needed.","Cliff Lake

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630411,"I woke up in Mazama Campground this morning, the only hiker in the PCT campsite. I was extra lazy. After finally making myself crawl out of my warm cacoon to use the bathroom, I crawled back in, made my tea and oatmeal, sat and looked ahead at trail things and thought about mileage. Around 9 I think, I decided to go for a walk to try to find Post and PegLeg. Also to try to find a way to unobtrusively wash my clothes...due to Covid, all of the laundry and shower facilities are closed. In an awesome stroke of luck, I found the ladies and PegLeg's husband just as they were getting ready to run up to the camp store. They asked if I thought I could find a spot to hang my hammock on their campsite and offered water and wash basins to do my laundry.

This is a fun group and while not my typical kind of trail experience, I like their style quite a lot. It's a nice reminder that the trail isn't just about the miles. There are still ways to get the miles and make time for other things along the way (though it does usually involve waking up earlier). And I have to say, these ladies have at least one excellent trail angel helping us out for a couple days (Peg's husband). In the form of excellent food and some driving to trail heads so we can get some miles without our full packs.

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630412,"Today we slackpacked (only carried water, snacks, etc) the Crater Lake Rim Trail - a popular alternate to the PCT. The official PCT route swings way out to the West, still staying in Crater Lake National Park, but never actually giving you a view of the lake. So if you hold the a purist viewpoint of hiking the trail (not using alternates, only sticking to official routes, etc), you miss a true gem unless you take extra time to find a way to hike both trails. The Rim Trail is only about 11 miles long so this is totally possible, but would be a hassle to sort out unless you hitch backward and start again or have some kind of support.At any rate, there are very few things I could say about Crater Lake that would be as good as the photos I will post. And most of the photos likely still won't quite do it justice. The blue of the water was so pure that it almost doesn't seem real. And being able to see the way that the shore line of Wizard Island (the cinder cone from the eruption of Mt Mazama, which now sits inside the lake) drops and turns teal and still sort of looks like remnants of lava...it's just amazing. We got up early and Pat drove us up to the trail at 7a. We had decided to walk SOBO, so that our destination was the Rim Village coffee shop and hopefully some sort of pre lunch treat. By starting early, we hoped to limit the number of tourists we would have to contend with at viewpoints and also hoped to beat the heat. We mostly accomplished both. By the time we finished at 11:30, the Village area was hopping. And also severely lacking in Rootbeer. Mission accomplished, we headed back to camp. Lunch, repacking, planning, wifi time, dinner, cards, and reading have all followed.Tomorrow we start back out in earnest. But only a few more days for me before I head home to process tomatos and peppers in the garden. And a few days for me to contemplate if I'd like to jump ahead 100 miles a week later, leaving a gap in my progess, but staying with Post and PegLeg to complete the rest of the state. It sounds like fun...and while I'd like to just jam out the whole state...sometimes knowing you have friends with you is worth the change in plans.","Mazama Campground

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630413,"Today we finally had to break down our awesome little base camp in Mazama Campground and start heading North again in earnest. However there were still 2 crucial jobs for Pat before he headed back home. At 7am he drove us again to the trailhead at the North side of Crater Lake sans packs. The three of us went for a brisk morning walk thru some incredibly flat and well tended trail. Three hours and nine miles later, Pat met us once again at a cute little trailhead with sandwiches and a five gallon water refill. Trail magic is so good - even when you know it's the plan.After basically a zero and a half, it was time once again to shoulder our full packs and begin trekking North toward the majestic peak of Mt Thielsen. A small resupply and full water bottles made everything feel heavier than our memories. I suggested that perhaps Pat put rocks in our packs as a cruel joke (he didn't).It was a slow and steady climb for the next 6 miles. As the trees began to thin out, we could see back to the Crater Lake Rim in the distance and the beautiful shores of Diamond Lake down below us. Thielsen itself played peekaboo just in front of us - never quite revealing it's full majesty until we reached the crossing of the trail up to the peak.We stayed for a bit to enjoy all the landscape that was laid out before us- Mt Bachelor and the Sisters peaks all out in the distance. While the craggy knife edge of Theilsen loomed at our backs. Thankfully, the PCT does not ask us to go up any further. Our minds were set on the creek of the same name that runs out of the mountain a couple of miles further along trail. I believe it was only about 3pm when we crossed the creek, discovered an excellent camp site on it's shores (with a view of the top point of the mountain), and were able to declare an end of the day.We all were looking forward to soaking feet and maybe legs in the creek. But...did I mention it is certainly mountain fed? It is like stepping into ice. Delicious to drink. Painful to spend more than a few moments in. I enjoy pouring water over my head as much as the next hiker, but today I settled for soaking my bandana and sort of bird bathing the dirt and sweat off instead of full immersion. Maybe someday I'll develop the ability to withstand colder experiences. But without a hot tub nearby, I won't hold my breath.","Grouse Hill

Brooklyn ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630414,"Today started like any other day. Wake up, breakdown camp, check water levels, tape feet, return to trail. We took a breakfast break (oatmeal and tea/coffee) about five miles in at the Oregon/Washington high point of the PCT...which was completely viewless - womp womp. Another five miles in (and a little extra), we arrived at Maidu Lake for a quick swim and some lunch. Have to say, as much as I love pouring a bottle of water over my head, being able to dunk my entire body into water in the middle of a hike day is even better. Not to mention I think I could feel my feet release some tension and swelling.Now, while we were sitting by the lake studying the map of the area (yes, we all actually carry real paper maps - Nat Geo in fact), PegLeg pointed out that she thinks it looks like there is a trail, other than the one we came in on, that leads back to the PCT. We had been lamenting that in order to have this lovely swim break, we still had to get back to the trail almost a mile and then still had six more to get to camp. Each of us took a turn studying the topography and agreed that, yes, it seems there must be a trail. It's written in brown meaning it's unmaintained, so it could be difficult to find. BUT it had a distance and we also had the GPS in my Guthooks to help navigate us if we had problems. Post promptly went off in search of the beginning and returned soon after to declare that she had found it. Adventure time ensued.This old trail showed occasional signs of recent usage. At times it was quite easy to follow. Other times it disappeared into the scrubby brush only to be found again once we'd stopped looking. I monitored the GPS from the back of the group occasionally giving simple guidance of ""we need to get West."" Or ""just keep straight, don't veer anymore left"" or ""we're only .2 away from the PCT"". At a certain point, we finally arrived close enough to the trail that my Guthooks stopped giving us a distance away. It assumed we were there. At that point, thru the trees, I could see a slight break in the forest - as if a trail had been blazed thru. I turned a hard right, and within 20 steps, was bursting thru a couple small firs to put my shoes back on trail. It was around 1pm and the sun was blazing hot. We all took a congratulatory drink break - we were now back on track and only had 3.6 miles until we would reach our destination for the day. We were thankful for the good fortune of discovering the alternate return route. What would have been a grueling uphill on trail became a shorter and more fulfilling climb. Though our trail mileage says we've gone 16 today, I know it's less than that. But I couldn't tell you exactly what - because Adventure Miles don't count toward the total.","

They may take you around an obstacle or allow you to experience something spectacular. To not allow for alternate options is to be a purist in your hike - you must follow a singular trail from point A to point B. I, however, am not a purist. Neither are my current companions.Today, we began on the PCT and are now in the middle of an alternate trail that led us by many more lakes, incurred hundreds less feet in elevation gain, and will ultimately cut 10 miles out of the journey. If I had been on my own, I likely would have stuck harder to the PCT. It is the goal to close out this state, so I will need to come back at some point.
