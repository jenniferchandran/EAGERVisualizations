Nemophilist has been coming down with a cold and decided she was getting off the trail. She called her husband and he is going to pick her up at Fontana Dam. It was bittersweet saying goodbye after spending so much time together on the trail. This morning we met Birdie & Toad again while we were taking a break. When we reached Fontana Dam we saw a pickup truck driving toward us. It was Less Miles. He had picked up his truck and was waiting to give us a ride to the Fontana Lodge. On our way to the lodge, we picked up Blueberry & her dog Java who were hitchhiking. She was a SOBO Thru-hiker from Germany needing to pick up supplies. After checking in to the lodge, we bought some snacks and drinks, showered, and then walked to the General Store/Laundromat. We had to do some laundry and also buy some supplies and beer. Once the laundry was done we walked back to the lodge and ate a nice dinner in the Bistro. The food was delicious. Mudsmeller had blackened chicken, pasta & cream sauce, and some wine. I had Shrimp & Grits with two craft beers. We each had bread pudding for dessert. Back at the room, we repacked our packs and we're watching some TV before going to sleep.","Birch Spring tent site

Doing a Flip-Flop starting at Rockfish Gap, VA. Hiking with Mudsmeller. Time is passing quickly. I have been preparing since September 2016 and have most of my gear purchased/updated and ready to go. I will post more about my gear in the future. My retirement date is set for March 31. I set foot on the AT in 74 days. May 1 to be exact.",,View Entry,"Feb 15, Wed",0

Hiked at the Wekiva Springs State Park in Altamonte Springs, Florida. The first day I hiked 10 miles and the second day I hiked 14 miles. The boots fit nicely and feel good.

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554932,I traded in my old external frame backpack for a lighter model last October. I decided on the Osprey Volt 75. I cut my backpack weight by three pounds with this purchase. I like the quality of the Osprey products. This pack weighs in at 4 pounds. Not in the ultralight category but still much lighter that what I was using before.,,View Entry,"Feb 21, Tue",0
Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555373,"Ok...so I decided to return my Osprey Volt to REI and buy a ULA Catalyst. There was nothing wrong with the Volt but when I tried on the Catalyst at Mountain Crossing Outfitters at Neel Gap, I fell in love with it. I like the feel and the configuration of the Catalyst better than the Volt. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a big fan of Osprey backpacks. However, I think the Catalyst will serve me better on the AT this year. The Catalyst also weighs a pound less than the Volt and I'm trying to keep my base weight below 20 pounds. This will help.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Tue",0

I am in my final week of being employed. As of Friday, March 31, I will be officially retired. After spending the last 30 years traveling around the country, living in hotel rooms, and sitting in front of a laptop computer, it will feel good to set foot on the trail. May 1 is still the magic date. I've pretty much got my gear all together though I'm still making some minor changes to reduce weight where I can. I'll have more time to add some posts about my gear after Friday. However, I do have a number of projects to complete at home before hitting the trail.

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559060,"Well it was official last Friday. I turned in the computer, badge, keys, etc. Been busy just getting everything in order at home. In addition to preparing my gear, I gotta get my taxes done. Nothing like waiting until the last minute  Been hiking up and down the bluff behind my house every day. There's a video in my video section. Check it out. I've also been busy writing and recording some guitar music to use in my videos. It's hard to believe I'm down to 24 days until I hit the trail. Still tweeking my gear to reduce my base weight. I'm a little over 22 pounds right now. Probably won't get it much lower but still working on it. That's it for now.",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Fri",0
Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560969,The days are passing by so quickly. My retirement was three weeks ago…seems like yesterday. Been trying to do my daily hikes but haven’t been successful because of all the other things that I have to get done before leaving. Still getting some good workouts in though. I’ve been packing and repacking my pack to find what works best. Also been weighing and adjusting my gear. It’s a never-ending process. Everyone says this will continue as you progress down the trail and realize there are things you don’t really need. I’m still at a base weight of 23 pounds. Wanted to keep it around 20 but that’s not going to happen. Twenty-three pounds only represents around 10% of my body weight. Yeah…I know that I’m carrying a little extra fat on my body but that will disappear quickly. My ideal body weight is around 210. That’s still a good percentage for my pack weight. Well that’s all for now. Will be setting foot on the trail in 11 days. Wahoo!!!,,View Entry,"Apr 20, Thu",0
Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562663,"The journey has begun. I hopped on an Amtrak in St. Louis on Saturday, April 29 heading for Chicago to meet my hiking partner, Mudsmeller. We took a train to Staunton, VA arriving on Sunday afternoon. On the train from Chicago we met Mama J, our sleeping car attendent. When we got settled into our Roomette, which was very small, we found out the electric outlet didn't work and we needed to charge our phones. Mama J was able to get us into a family room with a bathroom as long as we were out by 10am the next morning. What a deal...a bigger room with bigger beds and a shower! Trail magic on the train! I tipped her well when we reached our destination 
We are now at the Hampton Inn and we're planning on hitting the trail tomorrow morning but they are predicting severe thunderstorms. So we have decided to stay here another night and start hiking on Tuesday. Does that count as our first zero day? :) I helps when you don't have any time constraints for completing the hike. 
That''s all for now. See you on the trail.","St. Louis, MO

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563069,"Day one started with sunshine. Our shuttle driver Debby showed up at the hotel at 7:20 as planned. It was a 25 minute drive from the hotel to the Rockfish Gap trailhead. Debby was very pleasant. Debby has hiked sections of the trail and hopes to do a thru hike someday. She entertained us with stories of other hikers she has met. It was an enjoyable ride.
At the trailhead we bid Debby farewell and headed up the trail. Our firsteam stop was the Shanendoah National Park registration kiosk to register as backpackers. We will be hiking thru the park for about 10 days. 
It was a beautiful day with temperatures in the 60s and a nice breeze. There were some good climbs for us beginners but we managed them. A couple thru hikers passed us on the way to Calf Mountain shelter. Found a nice spot to set up the tent at the shelter and then cooked dinner. Food tasted mighty good after almost 8 miles of hiking thru the mountains.
There were 7 other hikers at the shelter. We had some good conversation before everyone heading to their tents at hiker midnight (8:00). All in all it was a great start to the journey","Rockfish Gap

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563675,"Today was a killer. It was 13 miles to the next hut. The night before a SOBO hiker told us there were no water sources for the last 12 miles of the hike. This meant that stealth camping wasn't practical. So we loaded up with extra water and headed down the trail. There was a nice stream running along the first mile but as we were told there was nothing after that. There were some good climbs but my body was feeling good...that is until about mile 10. I was dragging after that and of course there was a long climb to get to the hut. My water was all gone by then.
Blackrock hut is set down in a valley. Nice shelter with a piped spring. Water was first thing on the agenda then setting up the tent. There were 7 or 8 tents up already so our choices for a campsite were limited. The site we chose was rocky but worked fine. We were too tired to cook so had a package of tuna with a peanut butter & honey tortilla for dessert.
The night was cool & the whipper wills were serenading everyone...all night long! The day was exhausting but still a good day.","

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563687,"Started off the day with some ramen noodles & powdered eggs. It''s amazing what one will eat on the trail...and it tastes good too! It was a long climb to the top of Blackrock Mountain (3092 ft). We were met by two Park Law Enforcement officers where the trail from the hut met the AT. They were checking registrations. Said mine was actually filled out correctly. I said that was due to filling out forms when I was Scoutmaster of our local Boy Scout troop. When we reached the summit there were some amazing views.
Rain was predicted for late afternoon so we didn't waste time. Reached Loft Mountain campground and set up camp before the rain hit. Bought a Senior National Park pass when registering so camping was half price. A good $10 investment that will pay for itself at the next park campsite. Walked to the camp store for some microwave food & supplies. Returned to campsite to get clean clothes & soap to take a shower. Washed the clothes I was wearing in the shower then dried them in the laundry. How''s that for being frugal? :) Rain hit before clothes were dry so had to walk back to camp in the rain.
Rain started around 7 pm and didn't stop until 8 am. Fell asleep to the sound of rain on the tent. Life is good.","

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563693,"It rained a night. Finally stopped around 8 am. Quilts & some clothes got wet from condesation on walls of tent. Dried everything at laundry before hiking while Mudsmeller broke down camp. I had bought a calzone to have the night before but the rain prevented me from eating it. So I ate it for breakfast!...food is food! Brought coffee back from camp store. Was nice to have fresh coffee. 
Started today''s hike in light rain which got heavier as we progressed. It finally stoped raining around 2 pm. The trails were full of water. It was like hiking up and down waterfalls at times. 
After the rain stopped we were following the trail down a slope next to a rushing stream swollen by the 13 hours of rain the night before. When we reached the bottom we found out we had to now cross this rushing stream which was about 12 feet wide. Probably should have taken the boots off but was concerned about footIng in the rushing water. Decided to push through with boots on. What a rush! Scary and thrilling at the same time! Stopped and emptied water out of boots & wrung out socks. Walked in wet boots the rest of the day.
The next summit had a beautiful view. Stopped and changed into dry socks. Had to cross another stream at the Pinefield hut. This one was only about 4 feet actoss. Took boots off & crossed In bare feet. Set up camp & settled in for the night.","Loft Mountain campground

Met Larry the trail maintenance guy who was sitting at the shelter talking to other hikers. Larry was an interesting character. Although he was only a year older than I, he looked like the old man on the mountain with his long white beard and hair. He loved to talk. We had some good climbs and the day got colder as we went on. Took a lunch break on a beautiful overlook. It was cold and windy when we reached the campsite. There were 7 or 8 hiker in the hut trying to keep warm. Most had already sent their winter gear home. We set up our tent and prepared for a cold night.","Pinefield Hut

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564077,"Today was a bad day and a good day. It was cold when we woke up. Instead of cooking, we ate a Cliff bar and headed down the trail. Not a good idea when you have an 11 mile hike ahead of you. We only made it 5.6 miles before we realized our bodies were not going to make it to the end. So we stopped at the South River Picnic Area. I saw a maintenance lady and asked if she could give us a ride to the Lewis Mountain campground. She didn't have room in her truck but said she would call a Ranger. While we were waiting we called the campground and reserved a cabin for the night. We were licky because they had no vacancies but had just had a cancellation. Two Park Service Law Enforcement officers showed up and talked you us then gave us a ride to the campground. Nigel, the camps tore operator, checked us in. We bought some microwave sandwiches, bags of chips & beers and settled in for the night. Around 9:00 pm we were woken up by voices, flashlights and a knock on the door. The Law Enforcement officers were back with a pouch that had fallen off Mudsmellers backpack. Got lucky on that one. So the bad day turned into a good one by ending the day with food, beer in a warm cabin for the night. Decided to do a zero tomorrow to let the bodies recover.","

Since we didn't have to check out of the cabin until 11 we slept in. Microwave breakfast sandwiches, hard boiled eggs and coffee were on the menu for breakfast. We re-evaluated our food supply and bought some additional supplies at the camp store. Did some laundry and then found a campsite and registered. The coffee at the camp store was free so drank our share of it all day. The temperature's were below normal and cold all day long. After setting up the tent we sat around with our down quilts wrapped around us. More microwave food and beer for dinner. We met a young couple thru hiking, Brie and Sitting Bull. The four of us hung out in front of the camp store after it closed with Nigel and Harry. drinking beer and telling stories. Finally went to sleep under a full mon on another cold night.","

Our shuttle driver, Doctor Dick, was a retired gentleman. He drove us back to the South River picnic area where we had ended our hike on Sunday. Today was an easy hike of 6.1 miles to Bearfence hut. On our way there we met a group of 17 senior citizens out on a day hike. They came marching down the trail in a line. I wish I had gotten a picture of them all. I don't believe any one of them were under 75. The leader said they hike 30 miles over a number of days each year. He asked us questions about our thru hike. He then asked if we were staying at Skyland Resort on our hike. When I told him we had a reservation for Thursday, he invited us to their nightly happy hour. What a great surprise. We accepted.

I gabbed my toilet back with the toilet paper, wipes & sanitizer and off I went. After I had done my business I grabbed the bag for toilet paper only to find out I had grabed the bag with my toothbrush & other personal stuff. So there I sat. I tried to yell for help but to no avail. So I had to pull up my pants, walk back to my backpack & get what I needed. Then walk back to the privy to clean up. Too much information? Such is life on the trail. It was a good day for hiking. Had several good climbs but also a lot of Ridge walking. Of course there always seems to be a big climb at the end of the day. We made it to Big Meadows campground & walked to the lodge to see if they had a room for the night. It was supposed to be rainy the next morning. We were lucky. They had just opened for the season that afternoon so they had a room available. Had a delicious meal of Yankee Pot Roast for dinner and slept in a warm bed. OK so we'really cheating by not camping but the trail is long and you have to take advantage of these opportunities when they arise.","

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564877,"Had a great breakfast at the restaurant where we overheard a man talking to a couple about the Warrior Expedtions program. This program provides backpacking equipment to Veterans with PTSD. I was a little familiar with the program but thought it was only for hiking the AT. Apparently they have expanded the program to include seven other trails such as the PCT. This is a great program to help Veterans transition from their military experiences. Check out their website for more information : https://warriorexpeditions.org. During breakfast it started raining and rained most of the day. There was nothing else to do but hike on. I had reserved a room at the Skyland Resort so we knew there was a warm dry room, a restaurant and a Tap Room wating at the end. When we arrived, we were wet & cold. The man who checked us in was nice. When he saw that we were wet & tired hikers he changel our room from across the campus to the same building we were checking in at. Although we had been invited to a happy hour by the group of senior hikers a few days earlier, the building where they were was across the campus. We were tired and didn't want to walk in any more rain. So we decided not to go and headed to the tap room for some craft brews. We sat down at a table and a couple at the next table started a conversation with us. We had seen them at the restaurant the night before at Big Meadows Lodge. They had also hiked to Skyland. They were spending the night then walking back to Big Meadows the next day. They invited us to join them at their table. We had a couple of drinks and some enjoyable conversation before leaving them to go to dinner. I'm amazed at the number of interesting people we have met so far. This will be our last meal in a restaurant for a while. Tomorrow it''s back to trail food. Not that trail food is bad, it's just different.","

We had rinsed some of our clothes in the sink the night before and everything was dry. After a good breakfast in the restaurant we returned to the room and packed our bags. It was overcast and cold but no rain to start today''s hike The rain didn't start until around 2. Another day hiking in the cold rain. Toward the end of the day we had two miles of wet rocky descent. It was tough. I was getting tired and discouraged when along came 1st Sargeant & Beaker, two thru hikers I had seen on Trail Journals. They asked how I was doing and gave me words of encouragement which helped me carry on. The last 1.5 miles was uphill which seems to be a daily occurrence. We were both exhausted. I struggled. We probably should have stayed in the shelter because of the rain but decided to set up the tent in the light rain. After everything was set up we were again too tired to cook. We gobbled down some Spam and Poptarts. It''s amazing what you will eat after a long exhausting day of hiking. I hung the food bags and crashed for the night. I survived another day. All is good.","

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565401,"The rain stopped around 5 am. Packed up our wet tent & gear & went to the shelter to cook breakfast. We had been using a wood burning stove to cook on but today we decided to use our backup Jetboil gas stove because of the rain. There were two people left in the shelter, a father and son who were packing up to hike. They were doing a section hike going south. We talked about hiking and Scouting among other things. After they left a couple hikers came thru and said there were three car loads of Koreans coming up the trail. Sure enough, after a few minutes around 15 Koreans came walking up to the shelter. They gathered around the fire pit as we were packing up to leave. I walked to the spring for water. As I was standing there, one of the Koreans a me up and rrinsed his hands in the water. He then grabbed a couple of sticks and rinsed them off. I scratched my head wondering what that was all about. I followed him back to the shelter where I watched him thow the sticks on the pile of wood they were trying to start a fire with. They had a big pile of wet wood and one man was trying to start them on fire with a blow torch like device. I guess they don't teach fjre starting in Korea. We didn't stick around to see if they were successful. I was looking forward to today because we finally were going to pass close to a park wayside and could get a burger, frise and their famous blackberry shake. Boy was I disappointed when they told my their blackberry shake machine was broken. I did however devour a cheeseburger, chili-cheese fries and a Dr. Pepper with a Hostess cupcake for dessert. While we were eating, a lady came up and started talking to us. She was waiting for her husband who was slack packing. His trail name was Bee Man. He had tried a thru hike in 2016. He made it around 800 miles before an injury took him off the trail. This year he was continuin his hike buto slack packing with his wife shuttling him around. We also met young thru hiker named Jetpack because he hiked so fast. Our plans were to camp at the Matthew Campground but when we saw it was .7 mile off the trail.

We finally made it through Shenandoah National Park. It took longer than expected but we made it. We hiked two miles to the Gravel Springs Hut and stopped to cook breakfast. Spiderman hiked in while we were cooking. He was taking a break also although he had been up hiking longer than us. Several other day hikers strolled through while we were eating. We ran across Bee Man and his wife who were parked by a trailhead. We talked to them for a while. Further on down the trail Mudsmeller screamed and jumped back. A big rattlesnake was lying on the trail. It rattled it's warning then crawled into the weeds. It was more than 4 feet long and at least 3 inches in diameter. We did manage to get a few pictures. That got the adrenaline flowing. About a half mile from the shelter we lost the trail in the rocks. It took a few minutes to find our way. We then had to climb down a rocky cliff before arriving at the shelter. Tom Floyd is the first shelter after leaving the park. It was a nice shelter with a deck. The privy also had a split door so you could open the top and have a view while you take care of business. We met Spiderman again at the shelter. The sign for the tent sites was misleading and I walked half way down the hill to the spring before realizing my mistake. Not fun after a long day of hiking. Two young thru hikers set up their tents close to us. We fell asleep to the smell of them smoking pot. You never know what to expect on the trail.,"

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565494,"Today I discovered something new when I visited the privy...it had a split door. There was a bottom half and a top half so you could open the top half and have a view while you were taking care of business...cool! You never know what you will find on the trail. After eating a good breakfast we had an easy 4 mile hike from the Tom Floyd Wayside to the Mountain Home Cabbin. We had made a reservation so we knew there was room for us. We found a box of trail magic at the trailhead full of snacks. Arriving around noon, we texted the owner Scott that we were there. The sign on the porch said to take off your boots and help yourself to cookies and lemonade in the kitchen. The refrigerator was full of drinks for sale and there were also various snacks for sale. Paying is on the honor system. The cabbin was originally a log cabin used as slave quarters. The bricks were added in the 1920s. Scott and Lisa have done a wonderful job refurbishing the cabbin making it into a perfect place for the tired hiker to relax and get a good night''s sleep. For $25 you get a bed, a hot shower and Scott fixes you breakfast. They will also do your laundry for $3 a load. I highly recommend staying here if you can. After hot showers and changing into clean clothes we opened our resupply box & bounce box and divided the food up and refilled other supplies such as vitamins. I then called the A-1 Cab to get a ride into Front Royal. Our cab driver was quite the character and kept us entertained during our trip. After a visit to the visitor center to get our Passports stamped and our hiker gift bags (snack bar, chapstick & brochures) we ate lunch at The Main Street Mill restaurant next door. Hiker hunger had set in. I ate a taco salad and a reuben burger with fries. Also had a good craft beer to wash it down. We also found a nice coffee shop for a couple of coffees to drink while we waited for our cab to pick us up. The evening was spent relaxing and talking with the three other hikers that were staying the night. I'm learning that the best part of this journey is the other hikers you meet and talk to. Nemo was a nice young man who is a Eagle Scout. He has Asburgers and was bi-polar which are under control and was out on the trail doing a section hike. It''s enjoyable listening to the stories and tips from the other hikers. I'm learning something new every day.","

She was driving, talking on the phone and writing notes while she was driving. We got to the post office & there were no pens to be found in lobby. I finally found 2 on the main counter. When did the post office stop puttin pens out for people to use? After that we walked to a tattoo parlor to replace mudsmeller's nose piercing that was lost. We then found coffee shop & had croissant sliders, a pastry & coffee while waiting for our taxi. We finally headed back on trail around noon. It was a 5.4 miles hike to the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter. This is the fanciest shelter so far. The deck had a railing and there were lawn chairs on it. There was a cooking pavillion, a solar shower, horseshoe pits with horseshoes & privy with a view. Mudsmeller used the solar shower which wasn't warm due to lack of sunshine.

Even though we were drinking lots of water I was afraid of heat stroke setting in. We finally stopped at the Manassas Gap Shelter and cooled down in the spring. We met a young lady hiking south there. It didn't seem like she was really prepared for her hike but she was giving it her all. Someone had left bag of food at shelter. I grabbed a package of tuna & a Starbucks Via coffee packet. When we arrived at Dick's Dome Shelters we found the first shelter was old & small. It could hold 4 people comfortably. The second shelter was brand new & still not completely finished. That is where the other hikers were. We had a hard time finding a tent site and finally settled for one that someone had left garbage in fire ring. There were open packages of tuna & ramen noodles. We cleaned up the garbage (Alice''s Restaurant revisited - we had to pick up the garbage) & put with our's to pack out. This had to be from some weekend hikers. I don't believe a thru hiker would do this. After setting up camp and having dinner we soaked our feet in the stream. The cold water felt good on our tired sore feet.

We were the last to leave as usual. We hiked up the hill to the AT and met two hiker's taking a break on a rock. They had already hiked 10 miles. We had only started.. Today was another hot day. We had planned to get fresh water at the Sky Meadows State Park which was two miles ahead so we didn't pack extra water. When we got there we discovered the park visitor center was 1.7 miles off the trail so we hiked on. There were several streams along the way where we filtered water and took several cool down breaks. The heat was as bad as the day before. We heard thunder approaching about a mile from the Rod Hollow shelter where we planned to spend the night. We hiked faster not wanting to get caught in a thunderstorm. The thunder disappeared before we arrived at the shelter.There were 10 or more people and several tents set up at the shelter. We found a nice tent site near the stream away from the crowd where we set up the tent, cooked dinner, & hung the bear bags before the rain hit. It rained steady for an hour or so and the tent leaked! Fortunately it didn't leak a lot. We must have been in the flight path for Dulles Airport because we heard jets flying over all night.","Dick''s Dome Shelter

As usual we were the last ones to leave. But that isn't a problem. We enjoy having some coffee and a hot breakfast and enjoying the quiet of the morning and the sounds of the birds singing. We actually cooked breakfast in shelter because there were bees all over the picnic table. Someone had pilled something that they liked. I don't like bees buzzing around me while I'm eating breakfast.  Today was another hot day and we stopped at many streams to cool down. Today was also the start of the legendary ""Roller Coaster"" which kicked our butts. We hiked seven miles to the Sam Moore shelter at mile 1000.2 instead of the Bear's Den Hostel which was 10 miles away.  We had hoped to make it to the Bears Den Hostel but just didn't have the energy to get there. The Roller CoasCoaster is tough especially in the heat. While we were hiking, we heard two thru hikers behind us, Dance the Hiker & Megaphone, yelling at a bear. We had evidently walked past a bear without seeing it. At one poinpoint we crossed a bridge over a stream. We needed water so we stopped to drink and fill our water bottles. You really appreciate a stream on a hot day. While we were there a gentleman hiked thru with a seeing eye dog. He was legally blind and hiking a section of the trail. We continued our hike climbing up a mountain. About 3/4 of the way up I reached for my water bottle and it wasn't there. I had left it at the stream! Like a dunderhead I hiked back down the mountain with my pack on to retrieve my bottle only to realize I now had to hike back up the mountain...with my pack on! I should have taken my pack off before returning for my bottle. Another lesson learned on the trail. At the shelter we met young man who was doing a section hike. He had hiked Philmont so we talked about that. We also met a thru hiker ""In No Hurry"", who was retired from the military. His advice to us was to start out at 8 miles a day and keep that pace for a few weeks. He had twisted his ankle back in March and had to take 2 weeks off. A family of weekend campers hiked in and camped with us. It was nice falling asleep to the sound of a stream again.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Today''s plan was to hike 3 miles of the roller-coaster to the Bears Den Hostel where we were going to buy some food & drink for lunch & take a break. When we arrived we found out they didn't open until 5! There was a hiker there, Bluebell, who had stayed the night before and was waiting for a shuttle. She let us in and explained how things worked at the hostel. She encouraged us to spend the night. After hearing about the hiker package which included: a bunk, shower, laundry, a whole pizza, a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream & a soda for $30, we decided to relax for the rest of the day and spend the night. This is a once in a lifetime adventure and you might as well experience as much as you can. The first thing on the agenda was showers. There was a scale in the bathroom so I weighed myself after my shower. I've lost 17 pounds in 19 days! How''s that for a weight loss program? The hostel area is located in the basement which you can access from the back yard. At 5 o'clock they allowed us to go upstairs and register. After registering you have access to the entire floor which included a dining room and a great room with a fireplace. The upstairs also has overnight accommodation's for non-hikers and costs a lot more than $30. After registering we met a lady who was with a group from Ohio who worked for a newspaper. She asked to interview us for an article she was writing on hiking the AT. After the interview, we selected our pizzas in the freezer. They had the oven heated and ready to cook them. We ate dinner & talked with other hikers. We also did the laundry. I found a cheap guitar in the great room and played a couple songs on it. There was a fire going in the fireplace and it was fun relaxing and talking with the other hikers. Before returning downstairs we selected our flavor of Ben & Jerry ice cream and ate it. We were in bed early but could hear the group of ladies from Ohio singing & laughing until around 9:30. This place is a class act. Anone hiking the trail should spend a night at the Bears Den Hostel.

We had beautiful views at the Bears Den viewpoint & at Ravens Point. We needed water so we hiked .27 mile downhill to the Blackburn cabin to get water. This cabin is owned and run by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and has a bunkhouse for hikers to stay in for a fee. Hikers can also sleep on the big screened in porch. There is a caretaker who lives in the cabin. She met us when we arrived and gave us sodas & rice crispy treats. We had considered staying there but it was too early to stop. Along the way we met a Scout troop returning from a campout. At the shelter we ran into  Boots, who we had met at the Bears Den. We also met Stripper, Mama Bear, & Sherpa who had started a fire in the fire ring. The warm fire felt good on this cold evening. All six of us slept in the shelter because of pending rain. This was our first night sleeping in a shelter and it was a good experience.

There are no cabs in Harpers Ferry!  Called a cab in the next town and they said to call back in an hour! So we found a restaurant .3 mile from the hotel called the Bisou Bistro. Of course it was all uphill but it was worse the uphill walk.

Had lunch at a Grill next to outfitters...Baked brie with honey & almonds, meat on meat sandwich, with a couple of beers to wash it down. Later we stopped at the Guide Shack Cafe for coffee.

Re you kidding me, of course I'll take a free burger. His name was Franco and he had previously thru-hiked the trail. It was his birthday and he was out for a weekend hike. We sat and atell our lunch and talked with Franco and several other hikers. As we were leaving Franco asked if we wanted another burger to take along. He assured us it would last up to 14 days on the trail if you remove the pickles. The burgers lasted I until our next break. As we entered the trail, we found a cooler of trail magic. However there was only one can of soda left. We shared it with our burgers. We saw 2 more snakes and ran into Wanderer for the third time. As we were setting up our tent, Franco (the burger guy) showed up with Birdsong and Jeff. We had an enjoyable evening swapping stories around the fire ring.","William Penn Shelter

Everyone was taking videos as the snake crawled through the fire ring and toward our tent. It actually started to climb the tree next to our tent before crawling away. We had a short 3+ mile hike to highway 183. When we got there, three other hikers were there calling Rock & Sole for a ride. Our ride picked us up and we were off to the hostel. We had reserved ""Trashy"" the trailer which is a refurbished 1950s trailer. It looks like it could have been owned by Lucy and Ricky Ricardo. They even had the movie ""The Long Trailer"" which stars Lucille Ball and Design Arnez. The trailer was great. There is also a building with bunks that sleep six and more bunks in the basement. They have an outdoor shower and privy behind the bunkhouse. The lounge is chairs around a fire ring by a stream. The tradition is to put a chair in the stream and soak your feet in the stream. Craig, the owner, took us in to Dollar General to get supplies then to the beer store for some beer. This is included in the $40 fee. A home cooked dinner and breakfast are also included.

We had a long climb out of Port Clinton but it wasn'the as bad as we expected. About three miles into our hike I checked my GPS to see how far we had gone. Hmmmm...we started our hike 14 miles away from the hostel and we were now 17 miles away!!!??? Evidently there are two trailheads in Port Clinton and Joy had dropped us at the north trailhead. That''s why the climb out of Port Clinton wasn'the as bad as we expected...we had been hiking north! We called Craig and he said we could keep hiking north and he would pick us up at the Eckville shelter so we continued to hike north. We got to see both the Pulpit & Pinnacle which had great views.

Craig drove us back to Port Clinton and stopped at the Port Clinton barber shop. Frank the barber is a guitarist in a blues band. He keeps a selection of guitars out for hikers to pick up and play. So that''s exactly what I did! After my performance I got my Pasport staped and we were off on the trail. Today''s climb is what we had expected yesterday...long and steep. There were no water sources for the first 8 miles and it was a very hot & humid day. I was leading the hike today. As I approached a turn in the trail I saw a big timber rattlesnake slithering across the trail. I put on the brakes. It never did rattle at me but turned and crawled parallel to the trail towards me so I could take a few pics and a nice video. The rest of the hike was uneventful. We did find water jugs of trail magic at end of trail. Made it back to the hostel and enjoyed another delicious meal prepared by Jody.,"Port Clinton

Today we had to cross the Knife''s Edge. Rain was coming and we wanted to get past Knife''s Edge before it came. Unfortunately that didn't happen. The rain held off until we were on the knife''s Edge. It rained enough to get the rocks wet and slippery...just what you don't need on these rocks. We had already started and we weren't turning back. We just took our time and we're very careful. It took us 45 minutes to cross this quarter mile section of rocks but we did it withough any injuries. The rest of the day was filled with rocky trails and boulder scrambled. We only hiked 7 miles in 7 hours! We'll never get to Maine at this rate. We ran across a trail angel in a parking lot. We got a soda and a pear. Fresh fruit is always good to find. He finished the AT in 2015. It took him 14 years to finish in sections. We also met BR there.

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569005,"Woke up to a foggy morning today. The forest looked mystical. I like that. We had a fairly short hike of 7 miles to the Lehigh River Bridge. We then called Bert's Hostel to see if they had room. The lady said the hostel was full for the night but they had overflow beds in the garage in back. She said they try to never turn down a hiker who needs a place to stay. This was good since they were predicting some serious rain coming in. As we walked across the bridge we got a good view of the Lehigh Gap climb we were going to have to do. I had seen videos of people climbing it and was looking forward to the climb. But that is for later because today we were going in to Palmerton to stay at Bert's Hostel. When we got to the other side of th bridge we were looking for a good place to catch a ride in to the hostel. We still hadn't hitchhiked yet so this was going to be our first attempt. As we stood there at the stoplight looking around for a place to stick out our thumbs, a lady who was stopped at the stoplight rolled down her window and asked if we needed a ride. I guess we looked like lost hikers. We said we needed a ride in to Palmerton and she pulled over so we could load our backpacks and get in. It continues to amaze me there are so many good people out there that offer a helping hand when needed.  She drove us in to Palmerton and dropped us off at the hostel. We thanked her and went inside to register. After paying our fee for the night the waitress who checked us in, her name was Cheyenne, showed us to our sleeping quarters and gave us a tour of the facility. The garage was filled with several beds and several cots, six in total. The first thing we saw was a Queen size memory foam mattress! Dibs!!! The first thing on the agenda was showers. While Mudsmeller took her shower, I started a load of laundry in the basement. After my shower we went inside Bert's and had some lunch. We spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing then walked up the street to the Palmerton Hotel for some chili & beers. There was a liquor store up the street so we bought a bottle of tequila for medicinal purposes only :) We were lucky because we were the only hikers staying in the garage.","Stealth camp
","Bert''s Steakhouse Hostel, Palmerton, PA","Jun 17, Sat",7
Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569370,"The day started out with a hearty breakfast at Berts. The food here is great. Although the sign says Bert's Steakhouse, it is more like a 1950's diner. You can sit in a booth or on a stool at the counter. The servings are big and tasty! We wanted to climb Lehigh Gap today but it started to rain during breakfast. The climb was going to be tough with dry rocks so there was no way we were going to try to climb it with wet rocks. So instead we decided to slackpack from James Gap to Little Gap (7.3 miles). At least we could get some miles in and sleep another night on the wonderful memory foam mattress in the garage. We met our shuttle driver, Robert, who's trail name is Olive's Human. Olive is the name of his dog who accompanied him during his attempt to thru-hike the AT in 2016. He had some medical problems and had to get off the trail near Palmerton. That is when he met Tracy, the owner of Bert's. They hit it off and he is now living in Palmerton and providing shuttle services at the hostel for hikers. Robert drove us to the trailhead at Smith Gap Road and we hiked south to the Little Gap Road. The morning rain didn't last long so it was a good day to hike though it was hot. Robert picked us up when we were done hiking and drove us back to the hostel. On the way I asked him if there was a good place to buy beer near the hostel. As you know I like to taste different craft beers when I have the opportunity. He said that we would be driving past a place and he would stop so I could pick up some brews. Another example of how helpful the hiking community is. I bought a 6 pack of assorted beers and took them back to the garage. Of course I forgot that we had no way to chill the beers. No problem. Robert brought us a cooler full of ice for the beers! He said we could take beers into restaurant for dinner (BYOB) if we wanted. We decided to save the beers for later and just went for the food. Later in the evening around 8 o'clock we both had a craving for ice cream. Bert's has a wide variety of ice cream sundaes, banana splits, shakes, etc. So we walked to the front of the restaurant only to find out they had closed 5 minutes earlier. As we were standing there, Cheyenne came to the door to see what we needed. We said we were looking for some ice cream. She said to wait a minute and went in and talked to Tracy the owner. She then came back and said to come on in. Tracy hadn't cashed out yet so we could have ice cream. She locked the door behind us and we went to the counter. I ordered a FlufferNutter Sundae. For those who don't know what FlufferNutter is, it is peanut butter and marshmallow fluff. I've had FlufferNutter sandwiches before but never a sundae. I was expecting a regular serving like a normal sundae but I was wrong. This was basically a banana split with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff instead on the normal toppings. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. It was just bigger than I thought it would be but that didn't stop me from eating the whole thing. What a great way to end the day!","Smith Gap Road

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569371,"This morning the weather was perfect for the climb up Lehigh Gap. The sun was shining with blues skies. The heavy rain wasn't expected until after noon so we decided to make the climb. The other positive was we were going to slackpack so we didn't have our big packs on for the climb. Robert shuttled us to trailhead and we set off on our hike. As we hiked toward to top I kept looking back at the view and taking pictures. As we reached the top the climb got steeper and we had to use our hands to move forward. Neither of us are real comfortable with heights but Mudsmeller kept moving steadily toward to top without looking down. Me, however, had to keep looking back which was the wrong thing to do. As I got to the last big climb my nerves started to get to me. I had to move across the face of this huge boulder which had a narrow foothold. It's not like I was going to fall hundreds of feet but it would have been 20+ feet onto rocks. Not a good scenario. I almost turned around but Mudsmeller had already made it over the top and was out of sight. So I summed up some courage and moved forward finally making it to the top. Of course the trail is always full of surprises. What we thought was the top wasn't. We still had a large field of rock scree to climb thru to reach the trail at the top of the mountain. While hiking thru the rock scree another older hiker, Mountain Music, passed us. He  stopped and talked for a minute. I found out he plays guitar & fiddle & writes protest songs. He was an interesting character. The trail after the climb was easy for about 3 miles with lots of beautiful views of the valley and Palmerton. The last mile or so had rocks but was not too bad. Robert picked us and Mountain Music up at Little Gap around 12:15. Bert's restaurant closed at 2 so we went straight there for lunch. After showering we walked to grocery store for some supplies. The rain had started by the time we left the store. Fortunately we brought our rain gear along so walking back in the rain was like being on the trail agan. The really heavy rain hit after we got back to the garage and flash flood warnings were being issued. Later in the evening when the rain had stopped we walked to the Palmerton Hotel for beers & dinner. We also stopped at the ice cream parlor across the street for dessert. There were a number of hikers who got off the trail because of the heavy rains that were predicted so the hostel and the garage were full. Four young guys joined us in the garage which started to smell like a locker room. Oh well, that's life on the trail.","Blue Mountain Trailhead

We said goodbye to Tracy and Cheyenne thanking them for their hospitality. Robert drove us to the trailhead at Smith Gap Road. Today's hike was uneventful but we did pass a sign that said Katadin was 910 miles away. Getting a little closer every day. The rocks on the trail were bad. I am hating these Pennsylvania rocks! We found a stealth campsite at mile 1281.9. I do like it when we stealth camp. It's just the two of us enjoying a quiet evening in the woods. We always have a good meal and good conversation before hiker midnight strikes. The one thing I do not like is hanging the bear bag. It always takes a number of tries for me to get the rope up over a good branch. These attempts are always accompanied by cursing and swearing. Yes I can swear lie a sailor.

I thought she was hallucinating but she was not. We passed a tent along the trail and there sat Butterfly cooking pancakes. We talked to her a bit then headed on down the trail both wishing we could have some of her pancakes. Today was another hot & humid day. Neither of us are handling the heat very well. The long descent into town was grueling with a lot of rocks. The heat added to the difficulty. We were dragging ass by the time we stumbled into town past the Deer Head Inn, the oldest continuously running jazz club in the country. They have rooms and I wanted to stay there if we could even though it was a bit pricey. However, I found out they were closed today. Next to the Deer Head Inn is the Presbyterian Church of the Mountain which provides a hostel for thru-hikers and long distance section hikers of the Appalachian Trail. This is the oldest hostel on the trail. We thought about staying at the hostel but they were filled up so we found a hotel, the Pocono Inn. We ordered an Uber ride to the hotel. Uber has come in handy on this hike. Our driver, Pierre, lived across the street from the hostel so it didn't take him long to get there. After getting settled in and showering, we walked to the Sycamore Grill for dinner and some beers.

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569954,"I used to travel a lot with my job and I practically lived in hotels, usually the Marriott, Hilton and Holiday Inn chains which always offered a good selection of food for breakfast. This morning I had a bagel & Fruit Loops for breakfast at the Pocono Inn. Not because that's what I wanted but because that's all there was. I do like bagels but I'm not a big fan of fruit loops. But food is food and calories are calories. Besides, there was nothing else close by to go to. After breakfast we walked .4 of a mile to the trail. We passed another milestone today when we walked across the I-80 bridge over the Delaware River. The Pennsylvannia/New Jersey border is in the middle of the bridge. We had to stop there and take some pics. We both found the bridge a little unnerving with how much it shook every  time an 18-wheeler zipped past us. Once over the bridge we had to walk along a road leading to the New Jersey visitor center. Just before reaching the visitor center, a car stopped in front of us. A well dressed man got out and approached us asking if we were thru hikers. When we said yes he asked if we wanted some trail magic. He then removed several plastic containers from his car and set them on the hood. He said to help ourselves to whatever we wanted. There were all kinds of snacks and other food. He even had toilet paper. He said he passes this way every day he goes to work. When he sees thru hikers he stops and offers them trail magic. We made our selections and thanked him for his kindness. At the visitor center we ran into Snakeman, Waffles & Big Wave. We also saw them later at Mohican Outdoor Center (MOC). Today was another very hot & humid day with numerous spots on the trail where we were walking in the sun. We met a group of Venture Scouts preparing for  a Philmont Horse Trek and talked with them for a bit. Philmont is the National Boy Scout Ranch in New Mexico which offers various backpacking treks and horseback trek to Boy Scouts. I did a 65 mile backpacking trek with my son Adam back in 2000. The highlight of the day was Sunfish pond which was beautiful. We also found some interesting rock sculptures along the shoreline. However, Sunfish pond was also a low point of the day with all the rocks along the shoreline which we had the traverse. I was hoping the rocks would start to thin out after Pennsylvania but that wasn't the case today. New Jersey rocks suck as much as Pennsylvania rocks! We had to take a number of breaks due to the rocks and the heat and drank most of our water before reaching the MOC. I normally don't drink much soda but today I downed two Cherry Cokes & a Power Ade once we arrived at the MOC. We arrived with just enough time to order some dinner from the deli. We got a two person room in the bunkhouse. This means a room with a bunk bed. The bunkhouse is really nice. There are a number of rooms which sleep 2,3 and 4 people. There are two bathrooms and two showers which are shared by all. At the far end of the building is a full kitchen and and lounge area. Not bad digs to stay in. I offered to sleep in the top bunk which meant I had to climb down and back up the ladder every time I needed the bathroom. So my climbing up and down didn't end at the end of the day.

Since we were going to stay a couple nights I decided to join the Appalacian Mountain Club. They own a number of facilities, including the huts in the White Mountains. By joining I get a discount when I stay in one of their places. We had our bounce box delivered here not realizing that we could not mail it from here. We had to get a ride to the post office in town. I had mentioned this to Snakeman earlier and he had talked with Asian lady who was staying in the bunkhouse about us needing a ride into town. She was from Seattle and had a car. She offered to gibve us a ride to the Post Office & pharmacy. Her kindness was really appreciateed. We spent the rest of the day relaxing & catching up on journals. Mudsmeller slept all afternoon. Her stomach was bothering her. Saturday evening we again ate at the Lodge. They had a dinner buffet. It was a bit pricey but the food was delicious. We spent the evening talking with Butterfly & Velveeta though Velveeta didn't talk much. The rain came around 9 and it rained all night. I'm glad we decided to stay. On Sunday we had the breakfast buffet again. We were supposed to hit the trail again but Mudsmeller still wasn't feeling good so we decided to stay another day.

Feeling better physically but mentally we are still struggling. It was another hot day and the heat was getting to us. after about 5 and a half miles we decided we couldn't go any further. Mudsmeller was ready to get off the trail. We walked back to the nearest road which wasn't far. Mudsmeller called Enterprise and ordered a rental car. They picked us up at the trailhead and drove us back to the Enterprise office. She rented the car for two days and we found a hotel room.

I considered continuing alone. But in the end, I thought it was best to also get off the trail for now. We will rent a car to drive back to my mom's house in Illinois. The plan is to take some time off during July and August to rest up and get back on the trail in September when the weather is cooler. We will try to hike from Waynesboro, VA to Springer Mountain in the Fall.","

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576144,"Well the train tickets are bought and we are leaving on September 5. We will take the train to Staunton, VA, near Waynesboro, VA arriving on September 6. Plan to stay in a hostel and then set foot on the trail on September 7. It was tough getting to this point. we both went through periods of doubt as to whether we wanted to continue this journey. but after two months off the trail we decided to continue our quest. We have 862 miles to hike from Rockfish Gap, where we started hiking north in May, to Springer Mountain. The heat was one of the major factors that killed us this summer. It will be cooler hiking in the Fall. I image we will hit some snow in the Smokies but that shouldn't be a problem. We have to at least give it a shot. If all goes well and we complete this section, we will try to complete the northern section from NY to Katadin next Spring/Summer. 
I had a hard time keeping up on this blog, as well an my vlog on YouTube and my facebook page on the first hike. I found I was spending too much time focusing on that stuff and it was taking away from the hike. So this time I won't be doing a vlog. I may post on this blog occasionally but I will primarily focus on my facebook page. That is the easiest to do.

The Tye River is at the base of the Priest which will be our first major climb tomorrow morning. We climbed Three Ridges Mountain and Chimney Rock today. The trail was mostly downhill from Three Ridges Mountain to the campsite. The downhill was hard on my feet & knees and I was hobbling the last three miles. When we got to the campsite, we found out that the good campsites were full. So we had to put the tent between some big rocks with a couple rocks on the bottom. Thank God for our air mattresses to protect out backs from those rocks. The other sites were taken by Backwoods Ken and Barbie, and Scratch. Ken & Barbie were younger hikers. Ken was carrying a 70 pound pack! Barbie had a 50 pound pack. I can't imagine carrying either of those packs. Scratch was an older retired gentleman who was hiking the trail because it was on his bucket list. He had lost 125 lb after having bariatric surgery and had started hiking a Rockfish Gap also.

Both Mudsmeller and I agreed it was pretty nasty tasting but at least it was something different. Since there was no privy at the campsite, I selected a nice log with a view. Ya gotta make do with what you have :)  After packing up we crossed the Tye River and started our climb up the Priest. This is a 3,090 foot climb which was a bitch. We met Catywhompus sitting on a rock about half way up. His trail names is from the weird circular tent he has tied to the back of his pack. Kinda looks like a satellite dish. We also passed up Scratch on the climb and met and talked with several day hikers and weekenders. It took us 4 1/2 hours to reach the summit. The beautiful view at the top made it worth all the work it took to get there. After soaking up the view, we stopped at the Priest Mountain shelter for lunch of peanut butter, honey & squished bread. What is squished bread you ask? Well we tried carrying torillas on the first leg of our journey in May & June but found out they always stuck together. Someone told us to buy a loaf of wheat bread and sqeeze it together so it didn't take up much room. When it's time to eat you just peel each piece off. It worked really well and we called it squished bread. Backwoods Ken & Barbie & Catywhompus showed up while we were eating. Mountain Man Jim also joined us. He  borrowed our cup to get water out of the stream. After lunch we continued hiking to a tentsite near Spy Rock. It was in a beautiful clearing with many sites to choose from. I found the perfect tree branch to hang the bear bags and used the PCT method.Mudsmeller cooked a dinner with several types of beans, lentils, celery, cabbage, sweet potatoes and bone broth.

We hiked about two miles to Porter's Gap and filtered water from Rock Spring. Hiking further down the trail we discovered that Mother Nature had left us some trail magic...apples. We each grabbed a couple. Our next stop was the Seeley-Woodworth shelter where we stopped and cooked breakfast. I enjoyed an apple with my oatmeal. The gas for the stove wasn't working well due to the cold weather but we eventually got it going. There was another hiker in the shelter. The trail was good to us today. After climbing the Priest yesterday, these climbs seemed relatively easy and the weather was cool. Hiking in this cooler weather is much more enjoyable than the heat we experienced in May & June. We only hiked 8.2 miles today, stopping at Salt Log Gap. Along the way we came across a huge hornet's nest. Fortunately it was not active. Although we were planning on hiking further and going in to Buena Vista tomorrow to pick up a resupply box, we decided to get a shuttle in today because of predicted rain from Hurricane Irma for tonight & tomorrow. We made it to the post office 5 minutes before it closed. After that, we walked to JJ's Meat Shak for a dinner of pulled pork, beef, chili cheese fries & onion rings. Stopped by the Family Dollar for some candy for the trail and some food & drink for the hotel room. We had made a reservation for two nights at the Budget Inn, an older Mom & Pop motel. It was old but clean. After settling in I did some laundry. There was a convenience store across the street where I bought a six-pack of IPA. I was all set for Hurricane Irma!

We said goodbye to Catywhompus who was leaving the trail. Ken & Barbie were hiking back to the rest area to exchange their hammocks for a tent. We left the campsite around 10 am.

The first part of hike was a nice walking along a creek. Today was warm and muggy so we sweated a lot, especially on the last half mile uphill climb. It was steep with no switchbacks and no breeze. I thought it was supposed to be cool in the mountains in the Fall. That is not the case. The parking area near Punch Bowl Shelter had a trash can so we dumped our trash. Met a hiker named Trail Branches on the trail. He also stayed at Punch bowl Shelter.

I guess I'm getting old and forgetting where I put things. I received a text from a friend who told me that a good friend of mine had passed away the day before from a heart attack. Not a good way to start the day. Today we hiked10.6 miles to the James River parking area where we were going to be picked up and shuttled to Stanimal's 328 Hostel in Glasgow, VA. We passed the Little Ottie Cline Powell Memorial. Ottie was a five year old who wandered away from his school back in November 1890. He wandered 7 miles up the mountain and his body was found the following April. The last 4 miles of today's hike were killer downhills, especially Big and Little Rocky Rows and from Little Rocky Row to Johns Hollow Shelter. There was no water source for the first 8.8 miles. We rationed our water by not having cocoa for dinner the night before. We had also filled up our filter bottles a couple miles before the shelter. We found a stream at the shelter and filled our filter bottles again. Our pick up point was less than two miles away so that was all the water we needed. Once we reached the parking area, we called the hostel and got a ride. Bob the driver got upset at a slow driver, passed him in a no passing zone and the drove like a madman down the mountain reaching speeds of 85 mph at the bottom. We both thought we were going to die. We were thankful we made it to the hostel were we showered and went to Scotto's Restaurant for a dinner. The best part of coming off the trail is the chance to get a good meal. I had lasagna, sweet potato fries and a couple Vienna Lagers. Mudsmeller had manicotti and a glass or two of Merlot. We shared a cannoli and sugar puffs for dessert. Back at the hostel we were talking with Bob and Chipmonk who asked if we had met Mountain Man Jim. Of course we had  met him at the Priest Mountain Shelter and a couple of times after that. They told us that he had died from a heart attack on the trail a couple of days earlier. This hit me hard since I had just heard this morning that my friend had died.

Our shuttle driver, Bob, wasn't sure where the access trail was from the parking lot but we found it. Our first view was a beautiful view of the valley from the overlook. We were hiking north today and passed site where Mountain Man Jim died. Shortly after that we met a trail worker named Laura. This was the section of the trail she was responsible for and she was checking things out after hearing about about Mountain Man Jim. When she found out we had met him, she asked some questions to learn more about him. We shared what information we had. We were several miles from the end of our hike so we hiked out with Laura. She gave us a workout since she was a fast hiker. Along the way we ran into Chipmunk who had stayed with us at the hostel the night before. He was staying at a shelter tonight. When we got to the parking lot she offered to give us a ride to the hostel and we accepted. Another example of trail magic. One cool part of the day was crossing the James River Footbridge. This is the longest footbridge on the AT at 625 feet long. I find it interesting that the footbridge is dedicated to William Foot who was instrumental in getting the footbridge built. When we got back to the hostel we showered and went to Scotti's for dinner again. We had found out the night before that the entire hostel had been rented out for tonight. They had been trying to contact the people who had made the reservation to see if it was alright with them if we stayed there also. However, they still hadn't heard back from them. If they didn't agree, we would have to move to the shelter down ther road. When we got back from dinner we found out we could stay. The hostel is a home that was converted into a hostel so we just stayed in our bunk room while the people had the rest of the house to themselves. They were having a birthday party. At one point we heard a knock on the door. The people offered us tacos. We thanked them but said we were stuffed from our dinner, which was the truth.

Bob shuttled us back to Thunder Ridge and we hiked south 11.3 miles.We had another beautiful view from Thunder Ridge to start the day off. After that we hiked under the Guillotine. This is a famous point on the trail. The Guillotine is a boulder that is wedged between two other boulders and the trail goes under it. Water was scarce again today. The drought conditions seem to be getting worse the further south we go. As we were hiking we came across two lost bear hounds on the trail. Apparently the bear hunters are training their dogs for bear season and sometimes they get lost. Each dog had a GPS transmitting collar on them so the owners could track where they were. One dog followed us for a while. He looked tired and hungry so we decided to give it some water and jerky but when we turned around it was gone. I also got nailed by a couple yellow jackets . There apparently was a yellow jacket nest along the trail which I didn't see. When Bob dropped us off in th morning he said he thought there was a side trail near Bryant Creek shelter which would take us to a nearby campground. That was where he planned to pick us up. However, when we got there, there was no trail to the campground. Of course we didn't havee a phone signal so we couldn't contact Bob. There was a side trail that went to a parking lot in thee opposite direction of the campground. We decided to hike to the parking lot and hopefully get a signal along the way. We didn't get a signal until we reached the parking lot. Just as we were calling Bob, we heard a car coming up the road. It was Bob. He had realized that we had no way to get to the campground so he took a chance that we would be at the parking lot. Luck was on our side today. Tonight we decided not to eat a Scotti's again.

She was ahead on me and had stepped of the trail to take a picture. I didn't see her and hiked on by. I started Hiking faster to catch her but I still could not see her anywhere ahead. I couldn't believe she was hiking so fast so I increased my speed. Well I finally realized she wasn't hiking fast and that I was ahead. I turned the airplane mode off on my phone and saw that she had texted me wanting to know where the f*** I was this time. I responded saying that I would wait for her to catch up. After that we had another long climb up to the iconic McAfee Knob. Since it was a weekend, it was crowded with day hikers. We waited patiently for an opportunity to take each other's picture on the knob. The view was magnificent. The hike down from the knob was hard and we were tired.

The food was excellent and they had the best lemonade ever. It was crowded and we had to wait about a half hour but it was worth the wait.

I bought orange juice and some fig bars there. At the trailhead we met the Eagle Scout, his father, and Bull. They were ending their section hike at the next trailhead. Along the way we talked with a 74 year old hiker who said hiking on Sunday was his church. Makes perfect sense to me. We also met Omega who had stayed at Four Pines the night before. He was hiking north in his underwear (whitey Tighties). You just never know what to expect on the trail. We hiked 6 miles in 4 hours to start out but it took 4 hours to climb the 2 plus miles to Dragon's Tooth. One man warned us how strenuous the last part of the Dragon's Tooth climb was and suggested we do it at the beginning of the day rather then at the end. Of course, we didn't listen. We found out that it was a tough climb. There were several spots where it was hand over hand boulder climbs! The trail was crowed with a lot of day hikers along the climb. On the way up, we met a family with a 4 and 6 year old who climbed to the top. Now this is a dangerous climb for an adult much less a young child. I don't think I would have done it with young kids. We almost turned back when we had to climb up the face of a rock slab. Mudsmeller was leading the way and had a couple of young hikers help her when she got the the top. Since she made it up, I had to follow.It was after 6 o'clock when we finally made it to the top. We still had about 4 miles to the shelter that we had planned on staying at which was a bit too much for us at this time of the day. So we found a nice spot along the ridge to stealth camp at.

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581358,"Today was another day of drag your ass out of the tent, cook and eat breakfast, filter water, pack up camp and hit the trail. The first hiker we met was a section hiker named Big Ben. He got his trail name because he collects clocks. The next stop was Niday shelter to use the privy. That's where we met Just Jim (since he didn't have a trail name and his name is Jim...go figure) who had stayed at the shelter last night with Big Ben. Jim has a car and hikes in a couple of days until he reaches a good pickup point. He then hikes back to his car. After moving the car to the point he ended his hike, he repeats the process. He is essentially hiking the trail twice (NOBO & SOBO) at the same time. As we were hiking, Mudsmeller noticed a bag of tent poles that someone had dropped. Since we didn't know if the hiker was SOBO or NOBO, she hung it in a tree by the trail. A couple of miles later we saw a young man sitting up in a tree like the Cheshire Cat messing with his cell phone. We realized that we had met him at the Four Pines Hostel the night we stayed there. We asked him about the tent poles and sure enough they were his. I named him Cheshire Kid. We crossed the Eastern Continental Divide, hiked past the Bruised Knob Cairns, and reached the Keffer Oak near the end of the day. We are starting to see more and more colors in the trees. Angel's Rest hostel picked us up at Route 630. Doc Peppa, the owner of Angel's Rest, and Chris were waiting for us at the parking area. Doc Peppa forgot there was a good sized rock in front of the car and drove right into it. Fortunately it was close and she didn't have time to build up any speed so the car wasn't hurt. Back at the hostel we showered and Chris shuttled us to a nearby Mexican restaurant. Tonight we have a private room in a trailer which houses the hiker kitchen, lounge and laundry. There is also one other small private room in the trailer.  Our room also has a private bath. Time for another good night's sleep.","Craig Creek campsite

We ate some of our oatmeal for breakfast in the hostel kitchen. Chris drove us to trailhead at VA Route 630. We stopped at a gas station along the way and bought orange juice and some pastries. The first two miles of today's hike were pastures which were easy to hike. There was a cool breeze for most of the day. Our chuckle for the day was a bird pooping on Mudsmeller while we were taking a break. We met Nine again today. She had a full pack on and was heading south trying to catch up with friends. We passed each other several times during the day. After passing her for the last time today, we found her kerchief on the trail. Hopefully we will see her down the trail somewhere to return it. We passed another milestone today...700 miles!!! Only 1,490 miles to go! Our shuttle driver tonight was Sartech. He said his name stood for Search and Rescue Technician. The drive down the mountain was a long, winding, twisting, narrow rock road which went up and down the mountain to get back to hostel. We did laundry when we got back and ate at the China Buffet.

There was a group of hikers staying in the bunkhouse that called themselves Three Goldilocks and a Bear. The Three Goldilocks girls had made too many cookies last night and offered us chocolate chip cookies. Our shuttle left at 7 am. This morning was cooler with a nice breeze. We really had no views today. We met several NOBO section hikers including Overload, a young girl with a huge pack. Mudsmeller named the trail Sybil because it had so many personalities today, up, down, rocky & clear trails. She scared a partridge which burst into flight scaring us. We made it to the pick up point at VA Route 632 on time. Doc Peppa picked us up and took us to her favorite Korean restaurant for dinner. I had never had Korean food before. It was quite tasty. After dinner she dropped us off at the grocery store where we met Halfway. He told us that Bob, the shuttle driver from Stanimals in Glasgow, had died of a heart attack while driving. Fortunately there were no hikers with him at the time. This is the second person we have met on the trail who has passed away. Kinda scary for me considering I'm 67 years old. I hope this old body holds out for me. Back at the hostel I spied a guitar sitting by the TV. When I picked it up I realized is was a 3/4 size for children. I tried playing it anyway but the neck was a little small for my big hands. I do miss playing my guitars.","Route 630 (Angel's Rest Hostel)

Mudsmeller sighted an owl sitting on the side of trail. It apparently was on its prey and wouldn't move. We passed cautiously not knowing whether it would attack us. Later we walked through an apple orchard and meadow. We had several good views past there. Sartech was waiting for us at the Peter's Mountain trailhead. WE had asked him to pick up a canister of gas at Walmart that morning. He gave us the gas and we paid him. When we got back to the hostel, we talked with Doc Peppa about plans for tomorrow then walked to the Food Lion and bought food more beer.

We met Nemopholist again hiking south to Woods Hole Hostel. I was looking forward to the view from Angel's Rest but was disappointed that there wasn't much of a view there. It was a long climb down from Angel's Rest. I'm glad we went down rather than up. Some day hikers warned us of a yellow jacket nest ahead. We were able to avoid it. The shuttle picked us up and dropped us off at Dairy Queen for dinner. Then it was back to Food Lion for a few supplies. When we got back to the hostel I discovered that someone had stolen my Waldies camp shoes! I had left them in the rack on the porch in the morning. Sartech said there was a NOBO hiker who had stopped to do laundry and take a shower today. He hiked on after he was done. He was the only one who could have stolen them. He probably figured they were loaner shoes and no one would miss them. He hadn't left a phone number or email address so there was no way to contact him. I was stuck with a a clunky pair of camp shoes that really didn't fit me well. I had to do some surgery with my knife to make the fit. Needless to say, I was pissed. Since tonight is our last night here, I did some laundry. Doc Peppa, who is a Chiropractor and Acupuncturist, did some acupuncture on Mudsmeller's foot. Tonight will be our fifth night here.

After packing up our gear we drank coffee and talked with Sleeve who had just hiked in. Doc Peppa picked us up at 10 am and took us out to brunch at the Palisades Restaurant. Buying us brunch was her thank you for us staying at the hostel and for agreeing to do an interview video. Brunch was an all you can eat buffet and we both ate way too much food and drank Mimosas. I'm liking this being able to eat as much as I want without having to worry about gaining weight. I'll burn off the calories when I get back out on the trail. After breakfast, Doc drove us to Woods Hole Hostel. On the way there we stopped along the road in a spot with a beautiful view of the mountains. Chris set up her video camera and a couple of lawn chairs for us to sit in. Then she proceeded to do the interview. It was fun answering her questions and I look forward to seeing the video on the Angel's Rest Hostel website. At Woods Hole we met three hikers who we had met before: Nemopholist, Nine & Simpleton Extrordinaire. We also met Sail, Zach, Packaged Meat, Footprint & the owners, Neville & Mike. Woods Hole is a legend on the trail and I can see why. It is a working farm with many gardens and livestock. There is a bunkhouse for hikers and private rooms in the log cabin home. We got a private room in the house. Since this was a zero day, we had time to just relax. We had a resupply package sent here so we distributed the supplies. I walked downstairs to the living room and saw Sail sitting on the couch playing a guitar. I sat down and started a conversation. When she found out that I played guitar she handed the guitar over to me and asked me to play. I played several songs I had written. It was fun performing even though it was for just one person. When I was done, she played and sang a few songs. After that it was time for a nap. In the evening we ate a pot luck dinner with everyone. After dinner we asked to buy some of their homemade ice cream. Neville said that it had melted and then froze again so it probably wasn't very good. She gave it to us for free.

It was a beautiful day with cool weather. I could see breath this morning. Even though we were just slackpacking, the 15+ miles wore me out. I had put my knee braces in my pack for the shuttle ride but forgot to put them on when we reached the trailhead. I hike most of the day before realizing my mistake. Oh well, my knees held up anyway.  knee braces. We had an interesting conversation with a section hiker named Score who is from Pennsylvania. He is on a 20 year plan to hike the trail and has 624 miles to go to complete the trail.Says he may get it done in nineteen years. He had hiked at Philmont, the National Boy Scout Ranch, in 1976. I had done it in 2000. He had also just celebrated his 60th birthday. Today's hike was uneventful but we got some good miles in. Back at the hostel we enjoyed dinner with Neville, Mike, Flip, Nemopholis, Simpleton, JB, Footprint (girl from Austria), Sweets, Score, & Boss. We all dined as one big family. Like the night before, we held hands and each person gave their trail name, where they were from and something they were thankful for. Dinner was a salad, pasta with marinara sauce & pesto, homemade bread & birthday cake for dessert. Flip and Score were celebrating birthdays. All the food they serve is organic and grown in their own gardens or locally. All meat is raised locally.

Breakfast was oatmeal and blackberries with honey from Mudsmeller's bees and some coffee with Swiss Miss Cocoa mixed in. We had about a mile of uphill road walk, crossing over Interstate 77, to reach the Brushy Mountain Outpost where we stopped for lunch. I had a bacon cheeseburger, Cajun fries, two Dr. Peppers, and a coffee milkshake. Mudsmeller had two hot dogs, Cajun fries, two Pepsis (is that the proper plural for Pepsi?), and a chocolate shake. There was more uphill climbing after lunch with a couple of nice views. We met NOBO hiker, Tornado (He was a meteorologist) who was finishing his thru hike. He had injured himself on the second day of his hike coming from Springer Mountain so he went home to Roanoke for a few weeks to recover. Once he recovered, he realized that he would not have enough time to complete his hike if he started where he had left off. So he decided to start where he was in Roanoke and hike to Katadin. He then returned to where he had gotten off the trail the first time and was now completing the missed miles to Roanoke. Counselor, who we met at Woods Hole, passed us at the end of the day. Happy was at the campsite when we arrived.

Fortunately she wasn't hurt. We stopped at Jenkins shelter for our morning break and to use the privy. This afternoon we were taking a break, eating a snack when we heard noises behind us. When we turned we saw a mama bear and two cubs heading toward us. Mama bear saw us at the same time and ran down the mountain. The cubs each climbed a tree. We hurried to get our packs on and get out of there before mama bear came back for her cubs. Then we heard mama calling her cubs. The cubs climbed down and ran to mama. We hiked for 62 days in May and June and never saw a bear even in Shenandoah Nation Park where everyone was seeing bears. This is day 30 on this section of our hike. So we hiked a total of 92 days before we saw our first bear. That is unbelievable! Water is still scarce along the trail. The trees are getting more colorful each day that passes.

On our way there, we met a bow hunter walking on the trail toward us. It is now deer season and although hunters orange isn't as critical during bow season, I'm still glad we are wearing ours. At Walker Gap we filtered water from the spring. We then cooked and ate a breakfast of powdered eggs and Ramen noodles. I'm still not liking this breakfast dish. After breakfast we had a big climb up Lick Mountain and then a long descent across a bald on the other side. We met another bow hunter there. Mudsmeller talked to him about the hunting regulations here compared to back home in Minnesota. Water was scarce again today. At the top of Garden Mountain we stopped at the Chestnut Knob Shelter. There was a beautiful view of Burke's Garden, a very fascinating geological formation. The valley to the north looks like a giant, 8 mile by 4 mile crater from above. It was formed by a limestone sinkhole. The valley has only one natural outlet, in the north, and only two roads leading out of it. Part of hiking the trail is getting around blown down trees. Sometimes you climb over. Sometimes you climb under. And sometimes you walk around. Well today we came across some blow down that was like working your way through a maze. We climbed over, under, around and through to get to the other side. This was the worse we have seen so far.

This was the first time hiking in the rain for us since we had started back in early September. The trail was wet from yesterday's rain and the creek we crossed was swollen from the rains. We were hiking in pasture land this morning and hiked through a field with the cows looking at us. Mark hiked faster than us so he left us behind. Several hours later we met him coming up a hill as we were going down. He had gotten turned around and was hiking the wrong way.

It stayed that way and we were solid sweat all day. We met a guy standing by a tree with a 22 rifle hunting squirrels.

We gave her a $3 donation because that's all we had for small bills. The old schoolhouse has been restored with student desks, a chalkboard, a wood stove, American flag and pictures on the walls.  I found the 1872 Rules for Teachers to be very interesting. One rule said ""Men teachers may take one evening each week for courting purposes and two evenings a week if they go the church regularly"". Another rule said, ""Any teacher who smokes, uses liquor in any form, frequents pool or public halls or gets shaved in a barber shop will give good reason to suspect his worth, intention, integrity and honesty"". Punishment for students back then wouldn't be tolerated in today's society: Boys and girls playing together - 4 lashes; Telling lies - 7 lashes; Swearing at school - 8 lashes; For drinking spirituous liquors at school - 8 lashes; and for misbehaving to girls - 10 lashes. There were many more rules. They didn't spare the rod back in those days. Teachers were paid $30 a month. Any teacher who performed his labor faithfully and without fault for five years was given an increase of twenty-five cents a week in his pay if approved by the school board.  It was an interesting time back in 1872. We didn't see any hikers until late in the day when one young man, hiking south, passed us and then turned around and asked ""Are you Mudsmeller?"". He then thanked Mudsmeller for all of the posts she had made on the Guthook's app giving information on water sources. He said they saved his butt several times. Later, Compass, who we met at the Appalachian Dreamer Hostel, passed us. When we got to the Rogers Mountain Visitor center, we called Jim Sparks.

The water was collecting on the leaves and the wind made them drop on our tent all night long. Our tent was wet this morning. After having my coffee I gathered water while Mudsmeller cooked oatmeal. I filtered water for the two electrolyte bottles and used Aquamira for the food water bottles. We hiked 1.4 miles to the Old Orchard shelter and used the privy. We had a big climb to get to Grayson Highlands. The first thing we saw once we reached Grayson Highlands was a Girl Scout Troop doing the Hokey Pokey. It looked like they were on a weekend camp out. The bald was socked in by clouds so visibility wasn't very good. We had no view of the surrounding mountains but we did manage to see a couple of the longhorn cattle and a few of the wild ponies. When we reached the Massey Gap parking area, there were two wild ponies grazing by the parking area. Mudsmeller tried to call the Inn for a shuttle but she had no signal. A couple of day hikers who we had met on the trail today offered to drive us to the state park visitor center so we could call. We rode in the back of their pickup truck. Dennis, the owner of Grayson Highlands General Store & Inn, picked us up. Dennis is retired and had purchased the business last year. He is still in the process of remodeling rooms but our room was very nice. Our private bathroom is across the hall. We ate dinner in his little restaurant in the general store. I had a chili cheeseburger, a half of a grilled cheese sandwich, french fries & two Torpedo IPAs. Mudsmeller had a salmon burger, half of a grilled cheese, fries & two Torpedo IPAs. We each had dessert...a fresh baked cake and ice cream. Showers and laundry are done. Time to sleep.","Campsite by the Fox Creek (mile 510.5)

The weather was much better today with sunshine and clear views of the surrounding mountain. The views were magnificent! We saw many more wild ponies today. We had a long hike up Pine Mountain through a lot of rocks. At the top we passed through Fat Man's Squeeze. It was tight but still not a problem with our packs. There were a lot of weekend day hikers on the trail. We passed the trail to Mount Rogers, Virginia's highest peak. It was a half mile to the peak but we didn't want to add an extra mile to our hike so we didn't hike to the top. We had also heard that there were no views on the top anyway. Just after that we ran into some horseback riders heading north on the trail. Now horses are banned from the trail but some people just don't care about rules. Not only was this an inconvenience for us as we had to step off the trail to let them pass but it was also a danger to us because we didn't have a lot of room. If one of the horses got spooked we could have been hit by flying hooves. I could tell by the eyes of a couple of the horses that they didn't like us being so close. Tonight we are stealth camping on a ridge. There is no water here but there is a good spring up the trail we can hike to in the morning. This is a nice spot with a log to sit on to cook and eat dinner. There is also a good tree for hanging the bear bags. Life is good.","Grayson Highlands General Store & Inn

We hiked a half mile to a spring with a spectacular view. We were up over 5,000 feet and the valleys were filled with clouds. Some mountains looked like islands in a sea of clouds. Beautiful! We filtered water and cooked breakfast there. It was simply amazing sitting there eating breakfast with such a beautiful view. Later we met Pockets with his wife and their Labradoodle at Buzzard Rock. Pockets hiked from Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry in 2015. He is originally from New Hampshire but lives in Florida now. We had a good trail today. Although we got a late start, leaving around 10, we still managed to get 12 miles in. We haven't been seeing many snakes but Mudsmeller saw 2 garter snakes together. We stopped at Lost Mountain Shelter for a break. That's where we met So Far. He said when people asked him what his trail name was he would say ""Just Chris so far"". Makes sense to me. The AT merged with The Virginia Creeper Trail for a mile or so. I thought the Virginia Creeper Trail was a hiking trail but it's not. It is really a bikers trail. Bicycles were zipping by us as we hike along the trail. We had to be extra cautious so we didn't get run over. Tonight we are at Saunders shelter.  There are three section hikers from Kentucky staying in the shelter and two hikers staying in tents. We decided to also stay in the shelter because it is supposed to rain tonight. I walked all around the shelter area but couldn't find a rock for the bear bag ropes. I finally had to walk 2/10th mile to the spring to find one. There was a great branch for hanging the bags which made it easy. When I finally climbed into the shelter to sleep tonight, I found a nice rock inside. Are you kidding me? I spent all that time searching for a rock and there was one ten feet away in the shelter. Oh well, at least we'll be dry tonight when the rains come. Oh I almost forgot. We passed the 900 mile mark today.","Stealth site

Mudsmeller noticed her phone did not charge overnight. We hoped there would be a Verizon store somewhere near Damascus. We ran into a trail detour due a bridge being repaired. While on the detour we met two ladies who started asking us questions about our hike. They wanted to take our picture so we struck a pose :) Shortly after that we came to a parking area with rest rooms and benches. We decided to take a break. While we were sitting there eating a snack, two women rode up on bikes. It was a mother and daughter who saw us and started a conversation. They plan to hike the trail next year and asked a lot of questions. This afternoon we came across a cooler full of trail magic snacks! Tonight we are staying at the Woodchuck Hostel. We ate dinner at Bobo McFarlands. Mudsmeller had a steak and I had a pork chop. When we returned to the hostel we found Nemophilist sitting at the table. She had taken a zero day so we caught up with her. She gave us each a big hug. It was good to see her again. We also met and talked with a SOBO thru-hiker named Super Beef (named after a Massachusetts sandwich) and a section hiker named Tonka (she works in construction). The main hostel facility is in a house but we are staying in a cabin on the side. There is no heat in here and it is cool tonight but we have a space heater if we need it and also our down quilts.

She was able to  have her phone checked out at Verizon and found out her cord was bad.  She got a new charging cord and the problem is fixed. While she was getting her phone problem fixed, I hung out at the hostel. I talked with Critter, a long-haired dude about my age. He was full of himself I I soon wandered outside to get away from him. When Mudsmeller got back we checked out the two outfitters in town. Mudsmeller bought a few things. While she was shopping, I was talking with the guy behind the counter. I asked him about the Crooked Road Musical Heritage Trail sign I had seen on the street. He explained it is 300 miles of roads that wind through southwest Virginia. The trail promotes the various music venues and wayside exhibits on Virginia music and musicians. He told a story about how he once walked up to a house looking for water and there was a group of musicians jamming. The group included Bela Fleck and Ricky Skaggs! You don't see that every day.

He died in 1923 at the age of 72. His grave stone said, ""Lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone"". He apparently was a colorful character.

She is slackpacking this section with her husband shuttling her around in their motorhome.

While we were pondering whether we should hike or call for a shuttle, Grumpy walked up and asked if we were waiting for a shuttle to Boots Off. He had some free time so had driven up to see if he could catch us. Our decision was made. We hopped in the truck and headed to the hostel. Grumpy stopped at a gas station so we could buy a six pack of beer. After showering, we shuttled back into town to pick up dinner at McDonalds. We each had a double quarter pounder and a southwest salad! Tonight we sat by the campfire for a while then went to bed. We are staying in one of the cabins. It is small with two bunk beds.

I realized that this is the halfway point of our southbound journey. Today was a slackpacking day. The first four miles weren't bad as it was mostly downhill. We crossed the Watauga Dam at the bottom. There was a bi-plane flying overhead most of the morning. We passed the Watauga Lake Shelter which was closed due to bear activity. The shelter was actually closed for two years then reopened in 2016. But it was closed again shortly after it was reopened. After we got past Watauga Lake, we had a long, steep three mile climb up to Pond Flats and then a long, steep climb down the other side. While taking a break on top of Pond Flats, we met Jilly Goat. She was a teacher who was hiking to Damascus on her school break. Her name is Jill and she hikes like a Billy Goat, thus the trail name Jilly Goat. She warned us of a rattlesnake ahead. We walked cautiously until we thought we had passed the area it was in. However, a little further down the trail it scared us with it's rattle warning. It crawled into its hole before we could get a pic. We had a long, rocky climb to Laurel Falls. I've seen pictures of Laurel Falls and it is quite impressive. However, which wasn't impressive because the water flow was low. We had taken the side trail to the falls and now had a long, steep climb on rock stairs to get out of the Falls. I wish we had known the water flow was low. If I had I would have stayed on the trail which would have bypassed those steep stairs. It did help that we were slackpacking and didn't have our heavier packs. We met our shuttle driver at the Dennis Cove Road parking area. This evening I bought another six pack of beer. I had two double quarter pounders and a large fries. Mudsmeller had one double quarter pounder and a Southwest salad. I need to enjoy eating like this now because I won't be able to eat like this when I get off the trail. Tonight we met another interesting character. His name was Twisted. He is my age and has hiked the trail 7 times. He has also completed the Triple Crown of Hiking by completing the Appalachian Trail (2,190 miles), the Pacific Crest Trail (2,654 miles) and the Continental Divide Trail (3,100 miles). This year he was attempting to hike the original AT. This must take a lot of research since the trail has changed so much through the years. After dinner we drank all of beer while sitting around the campfire. Two young men played guitars around the fire. Their music was influenced by Phish and was very fun to listen to.

The food was excellent and the servings big. Ham, eggs, hash browns, pancakes, biscuits & gravy, coffee, orange juice, and a huge cinnamon roll! The perfect way to start your day. We even had leftovers for breakfast tomorrow. There was a Dollar General next door so we stopped there to pick up some food supplies. Next we walked to Bluff Mountain Outfitters. I needed to pick up a long sleeve wool shirt and some other winter gear because the weather is getting colder.  They had everything I needed. They also allow hikers to register with the Nation Park Service for hiking through the Smokey Mountain National Park. We took advantage of that and both completed and paid for our registrations. We were hoping to spend some time in the mineral baths at the Hot Springs Resort & Spa. However, it is a weekend and they were entirely booked up. This afternoon we divided up the food from the resupply box we had sent to the hostel. Later, Nemophilist and Trail Dawgs joined us for beer and food at the Spring Creek Tavern.","Laughing Heart hostel

We're going to lose an hour of daylight today due to the time change for daylight savings time. That means we need to get up earlier so we can make it to our campsite before dark. These short days really suck though I do like the cooler days that go with it. There were a couple of climbs today that I struggled with. One was 2,000 feet over a 3 mile stretch. We hiked to the Walnut Mountain shelter. Nemophilist was there waiting for us. We plan to hike with her through the Smokey Mountain National Park. There is one NOBO section hiker staying in the shelter tonight. As usual, we are staying in our tent. Shelters are alright if the weather is going to be bad but we prefer the privacy of the tent. The tent also holds in the heat better on these cold night. While we were having dinner, Sticks, who we met at the Laughing Heart Hostel, and another hiker came through. They were slackpacking north back to the hostel. I couldn't believe they were going another 13 miles at this time of day. They will be hike a long way in the dark. This didn't seem to faze them. I guess it's because they are young and fearless. Us old farts are a little more cautious out here. I'm not interested in hiking in the dark. At least I am. The moon is bright tonight. It is also windy.

As we were walking to the shelter to fix breakfast we scared Nemophilist when we walked past her tent in the dark. She thought a bear was outside her tent. That got her heart pumping! I walked down to the spring to get water. The sky was beautiful with the light reflecting off the clouds. We sttopped at Roaring Fork shelter for a break on our way to Max Patch. The weather was cloudy but I figured we should still have a decent view by the time we got to Max Patch...I was wrong. It started to rain and the fog started rolling in. By the time we got there, it was socked in and we could barely see ten feet in front of us. Didn't get any views today. It rained off & on the rest of the day. The three of us have the shelter to ourselves tonight. We've decided to sleep in the shelter tonight because more rain is supposed to come later tonight.

Nemophilist made arrangements for them to pick us up and bring us to the campground for the night.  By the time we reached the pick up point, the sun was out and we had blue skies. Even so, seeing them waiting for us after hiking in the drenching rain all morning was a welcome sight. There were some beautiful views on our ride. We reached the campground by mid afternoon. Mudsmeller and I are staying in the Mama Bear cabin. This is a cute little cabin with a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and heat! Patrick let us use their golf cart to bring our packs to cabin. Mudsmeller had noticed something unusual with her vision a couple days ago so she found a local eye doctor and was able to make an appointment for this evening. Patrick let us use his truck to drive to the appointment. I filled up the gas tank in appreciation for the ride. The eye doctor did an exam and found nothing wrong. After the appointment, we stopped at Walmart for a few things including beer.

I had a big skillet breakfast which consisted of: country ham, bacon, 2 eggs over easy, grits, corn pone, fried potatoes, a  cornbread pancake, coffee & orange juice. Yum!!! It was a long wait before we could be seated so we walked down the street to the Nantahala Outfitters to pick up some supplies. Last night, when Klaire was showing us their home, I saw a stand-up bass and an electric bass guitar in the living room.  She said that Patrick played bass. Klaire also had an acoustic guitar so when we got back from breakfast, Patrick and I played a few tunes together. Tonight, Nemophilist bought BBQ for our dinner (pork, beef, chicken & ribs). Klaire also made salads. It was another good meal. We drank some beers and visited. Now we are back at our cabin. Tomorrow we will be back on the trail. Our plan is to have Kaire drive us to Newfound Gap which is near the center of the Smokey Mountain National Park.

Klaire droppd us off at the Newfound Gap parking area. After some goodbye hugs, we started hiking north on the trail. Early on we had some grand views of the North Carolina Smokies towards the south. We also had some outstanding views of Mount LeConte and Myrtle Point towards the northwest. We stopped for break at the Ice Water Springs shelter. About four miles in we came to Charlie's Bunion which is a rock outcropping that was originally known as Fodderstack. The current name was derived when Charlie Conner went hiking one day with Horace Kephart, one of the early proponents for a national park in the Smokies, and author of Our Southern Highlanders. When they paused for a rest on the rocks, Conner took his boots and socks off and exposed a bunion that resembled the surrounding rocks. Looking at Conner's feet, Kephart remarked, ""Charlie, I'm going to get this place put on a government map for you."" And so he did. We finished today's hike at Peck's Corner Shelter. The shelter is full of weekenders who are in party mode. Although you are supposed to stay in the shelters in the Smokey Mountain National Park, there was no room. This suited us as we didn't want to be kept awake by people partying. We found a place to set up our tent as it was getting dark. Once that was done, we went back to the shelter and cooked dinner. We struck up a conversation with a group from St. Louis who were the primary party people. They offered us some of their whiskey and became our immediate friends. After eating dinner and having a few shots of whiskey we headed to our tents. The St. Louis group is partying loudly as I write this. It was another cold day today. Most of the day I could see my breath. We also saw icicles in spots along the trail. There were two things I noticed about the two shelters we saw today that was different than any of the previous shelters I had seen. Each shelter had a fireplace inside the shelter and each shelter had a large tarp hanging in front to keep the wind out.

It was a long climb to get there although there were some beautiful views of the sun rays shining through the trees. Clingman's Dome is famous for the spectacular 360 degree view you get from the viewing tower. However, the viewing tower was closed for renovation. Several people went under the rope and climbed to the top anyway. I guess I'm old fashioned but I follow the rules. We decided to walk down to the parking area which had some good views and found a good view about halfway down the road. A couple passing by offered to take our picture. We found the best view was a short distance further south on the AT. We came to an overlook that had a magnificent view of the mountains. We met two women about a half mile before reaching Clingman's Dome. They were walking north searching for a knife one of them had lost earlier. We told them we hadn't seen a knife and they continued on their search. Shortly after that I found the knife on the trail. I didn't want to backtrack to find them so I picked up the knife hoping they would come back our way. While we were stopped at Clingman's Dome they walked in.

They showed up a short time later. Tom gave us drinks, snacks, and 2 breakfast sandwiches. We called Bob at 4:15 pm for ride. He showed up an hour and a half later. By then it was getting pretty cold and dark. When we got back to the hostel, we cooked one of our trail meals for dinner. We are now back in our warm cabin getting ready to sleep. Tomorrow we are back on the trail with full packs.","Hogpen Gap (Top of Georgia Hostel)

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583611,"We had a short day hiking today, only hiking 6.9 miles to Neels Gap. We had planned this so we could stay at the Misty Mountain Inn and do some more slackpacking. When we got to Neels Gap, we bought Cuban sandwiches, chips & Almond Joys for lunch. I called David, owner of Misty Mountain Inn, and he picked us up and shuttled us to the Inn. He stopped at a gas station so we could buy some beer and supplies. Patty, David's wife, gave us a basket of goodies which included: apples, 3 tangerines, 2 oatmeal mixes for breakfast, chocolates, teas, & hot cocoa packets. The cabin we are staying in is beautiful. We both enjoyed hot showers and are spending the evening drinking some beers and watching remodeling shows and the Big Bang Theory on TV. Going to enjoy the night in a warm bed in a warm cabin. The end of the trail is in sight. We plan to slackpack a section tomorrow and hope to reach Springer Mountain in three days!","Hogpen Gap (Top of Georgia Hostel)

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583612,"David drove us to Neels Gap this morning for a day of slackpacking. We hiked 14.3 miles to Gooch Gap. The first climb of the day was Blood Mountain. There were some beautiful views on top of Blood Mountain. The shelter on top is a stone building. I imagine it gets quite cold in there when it is cold outside. When we reached Woody Gap we ran into Tom again. As usual, he gave us snacks and drinks. We spent some time talking with Tom and enjoying our snacks then headed on down the trail to Gooch Gap. David got lost coming to pick us up and showed up as it was getting dark. Made another stop at the Dollar General and the gas station for beer and snacks. David told us that Patty was making dinner for us. Dinner was actually leftovers which we didn't mind at all. We had chicken, sweet taters, summer squash and rice. After eating our dinner, we walked to David and Patty's house to pay our bill. After paying it, Patty realized that she had forgotten to add the cost of the shuttles. She said not to worry and to consider it a birthday present since it was Mudsmeller's birthday. Of course, as usual, I had forgotten it was her birthday. Patty took our picture on the front porch and then we headed back to our cabin. We plan to drink four of our six beers tonight and save two for our last night on the trail tomorrow night.","Neels Gap (Misty Mountain Inn)

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583613,"This morning David drove us back to Gooch Gap where we started our hike with full packs. Today we hiked 9 miles to the Hawk Mountain shelter. We met Tom, Fearless and JD at Cooper Gap this afternoon. Tom had sandwiches, snacks and drinks for us. There was some light rain this afternoon but it stopped by the time we reached the shelter. Tonight was the last time we will set up our tent. We cooked and ate our last trail meal while enjoying our beers to celebrate our last night on the trail! It is hard to believe that tomorrow will be the last day of our journey. The moon is out tonight. What a great way to spend our last night on the trail.","Gooch Gap (Misty Mountain Inn)

Cutie Handful,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583614,"Well today was our final day of hiking! We woke to a foggy morning and hiked 8.1 miles to southern terminus of the AT on Springer Mountain. We didn't know this, but JD, Fearless, Bear & Sierra Mist passed us when we took a side trail to see Long Creek Falls. As we were approaching the parking lot at the base of Springer Mountain we saw a large group of people. It turned out that JD'S wife and friends were having a party for him to celebrate the completion of his thru-hike. We stopped and had some food and drink before completing the last mile of our hike. Fearless and Tom were there also. Tom gave me a bottle of beer to celebrate the completion of our hike. We found out that Bear had proposed to Sierra Mist on top of Springer Mountain. We met them and their families coming down as we were climbing up. When we reached the summit, we hugged, took pics and drank the beer to celebrate our hike. It was a bittersweet moment for both of us. We were elated that we had completed almost 1400 miles of the trail over a period of five months but were sad to be leaving the trail behind us. We called for a shuttle and had to hike back down to the parking lot. On the way down, we met W (from Germany) as he was climbing up to complete his thru-hike. He said that he was sad also now that his hike was over. Our shuttle driver picked us up at the parking lot and drove us to the Amicalola Falls Lodge. He was a character. He and Mudsmeller talked hunting during our 45 minute drive to the lodge. Our room here has a beautiful view of the mountains. After showering (Mudsmeller loved the super hot shower) we headed to the restaurant for drinks and dinner...our final celebration of our hike. Although we didn't complete the flip-flop thru-hike that we had planned, we did complete almost 1400 miles of the trail. Not bad for a couple of old farts! The main thing is we hiked our own hike. I'm sure there will be some out there who will criticize us for a number of things, such as not completing our thru-hike or slackpacking as much as we did or staying in fancy lodges and bed & breakfasts when we had the opportunity. So what. We hiked our own hike and we enjoyed our hike! That is all that matters. We are both looking forward to completing the northern section of the trail from Greenwood Lake, NY to Mount Katahdin next year!","Hawk Mountain Shelter
