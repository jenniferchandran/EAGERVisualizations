Dynamite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555405,"Before I announce my plans to hike the Appalachian Trail it would probably be a good idea to actually do some hiking. The majority of my hiking in the last few years has been in conjunction with hunting. Hiking in, stalking, and coming out of the woods had put many miles on my boots. Trail hiking had not been a major part of my outdoor experience. The Pine Mountain Trail located in FDR (Franklin Delano Roosevelt ) State Park is only about a half hour from where I live. I had done some hiking on the trail, but certainly not extensively. One Sunday afternoon in May I put a few hiking essentials in a pack, laced up my boots and headed to the trail. There are signs announcing the start of the trail with other signs explaining the rules. I took a deep breath and to my surprise,realized I was frightened. I took another deep breath and stepped on to the trail. Just a few yards from the entrance I stopped to take some photos of some spring flowers. Another few yards and I took a few more pictures.Wait a minute! What was going on? I felt frightened and was delaying my hike. I stopped and took a few more deep breaths and considered the situation. This was the first time I had ever hiked alone. What a revelation! Especially to a person who not only likes but seeks her own company.   Once identified, the fear and hesitation disappeared. Whatever I might encounter on this trail on this day was the beginning of this journey. Guess this is the reason to practice. The preparation for the 2189 miles ahead is daunting. Who knew that this three and a half mile trek would teach me so much. It may be cliche to say that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step but my single step on this day did lead to completing the immediate goal of 3.5 miles.When I returned to the parking lot I felt like Rocky. I had conquered the concern of hiking alone. The trail goes up and down. I slipped several times on uphills or downhills. Most hikers carry trekking poles or hiking staffs which assist in staying upright and maneuvering over downed logs or other obstacles. They help you keep your balance, give you extra power going uphill and relieve stress on your knees going downhill. I had identified a necessary piece of gear. I stopped at the Park Office to purchase a handmade wooden hiking stick.    I spied a t-shirt sporting the words “I completed the 400 mile challenge.” The sign pinned to the shirt said to ask about the Challenge. The park ranger explained that the idea was to cover 400 miles in FDR State Park within 12 months. You receive an online spreadsheet to record the date and the number of miles. When you complete the 400 miles you get a t-shirt. I signed up. Some people will do anything for a t-shirt. Count me in.",,The First hike,"May 10, Tue",0
Dynamite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558489,"The Final ChallengeJune 1 was my deadline to go or no go. I read books and watched movies about the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail and El Camino de Santiago. I read books about training for marathons and ultra (more than 50 miles) marathons as well as for hiking and biking.The experience of others gives one insight into what may be required and how to deal with the challenges. Books without action don’t get the body in shape. I continued my workout schedule of stationary biking and weightlifting and added some additional walks of 1.5 to 4 miles. The first challenge is the decision. The final challenge is also the decision. Will I be able to complete all 2175 miles? It is one step at a time but, do I have what it takes to put those steps together for the number of days it will take to reach Mt. Katahdin?A plan began to form. Averaging 15 miles per day, the trek from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mt Katahdin in Maine will take slightly less than 5 months. Building in rest days and partial days the hike can be done in 6 months. Memorial Day Weekend would give me an extra weekend day to hike. The Pine Mountain Trail in FDR* State Park is 23 miles. If I can make the full 23 miles in two days I will be able to average the 12 to 15 miles per day I need to complete the AT in approximately 6 months.My husband listened to me talk about the AT. “ I want to go with you. You shouldn’t be out there by yourself. Things can happen.” he said.“Okay, if you can do the Pine Mountain Trail with me we will plan for you to go too.”Equipped with a matching walking stick and knee braces we started out on Saturday morning. The first couple of miles weren’t bad. By the end of the 3rd mile it was evident to me that he is not physically up to the challenge. But he is determined (maybe read that “stubborn”) and he kept going--very slowly. After 6 miles he was moving at a snail’s pace or not at all. One or both of us had to stop. He decided to leave the trail, go back to our car and pick me up at my preselected finish point. I completed the 11 miles planned for Saturday and did 12 miles on Sunday. Mission accomplished. The first day was grueling. Several times I stopped and went back to help my husband. The slow pace is more difficult for me than a much faster hike. Saturday took several hours longer that Sunday. At the end of both days, I was tired but could have hiked more on either day.The Appalachian Trail is a go. When I started telling my friends and acquaintances my plan, I’m committed. When I set up the special facebook page, I am telling the world. It’s too late to back out.It’s too late not to spend the next 8-9 months planning, practicing, and preparing.","

Dynamite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558502,"The First DayMarch 16, 2017 dawned as beautiful but slightly chilly morning in South Georgia. Today is the start date. Wait a minute, the start date of---yes, the start day for the Appalachian Trail. 
Two of my dear friends were planning to accompany me to the trailhead at Springer Mountain and a couple more miles down the trail. My plan was to hike to Hawk Mountain Shelter, a distance of 8.1 miles. Including the mile from the parking lot to the beginning of the trail would be a little over 9 miles.
We arrived at Amicolola Falls State Park Headquarters before noon. I signed in as hiker #873 and weighed my pack. 36 pounds. What was I carrying and what was I thinking? 
We got directions from Amicalola to Springer including a recommendation for lunch. We stopped at Crossroads Grocery which lived up to the billing of not looking like a restaurant, but having fabulous fresh food. Half of my sandwich went in my backpack. 
We chatted with the owner, I purchased an AT passport and he provided my first “trail magic,” complimentary ice cream. He also gave us better directions to Springer.
We reached the parking lot and hiked up to the Official Start of The Appalachian National Scenic Trail. I signed the book in the rock. It was official.
We hiked back to the parking lot and I got my pack. My first 2 miles ( 1 official - the hike up to the start doesn’t count) on the trail were “slacking.” Then we started down the trail. We had had a glorious fun day before reality set in. My friends went about half a mile down the trail and turned back.
I was on my own, carrying more that ? of my body weight. There had been snow two days before. Most of it had melted which left the trail a muddy mess. The trail was so slick that every step was a challenge. Thanks to my trekking poles I stayed upright. 
What was that plan of 9 miles today? With the slip sliding conditions and the excessive weight, I was lucky to make it 2.8 miles to Stover Creek Shelter. There was room in the shelter, but I needed a private room. 
I was exhausted, starving and thoroughly humiliated by my rookie mistakes. The lunchtime leftover half sandwich came out of my pack. I ate that before setting up my tent, aka private room.
A very nice young man who had attended Wake Forest University in NC (my home state) asked me how to work the bear cables. Together we figured it out and he hung my food bag at the same time. 
When we accomplished that chore, I realized my tent was directly under the line holding the food bags for at least 20 hikers. No bears showed up to try to get to the food, so I survived the first night.","Springer Mountain

When I came down into the gap there was ""trail magic"" and heavy winds. The candy and cokes were the beginning of my problems.  I had eaten very little that day. A sugary drink and 2 candy bars gave me some energy. 
Oboe Hobo, a through hiker from several years ago provided the trail magic and gave me a ride to Woody Gap to meet a friend from Cumming.","Hawk Mtn

5 miles with 2 of them down hill should be a piece of cake. Wrong answer.  The North side of Blood is straight down over incredible rocks.  
This was my ""blue bug"" day. I leaned over to pick up a piece of trash, lost my balance and fell backwards. My pack absorbed all the momentum of the fall.  As I tried to regain my footing a man wearing knickers came around me and offered me hand up.  My pack and my jacket are blue. Lying on my back in the rocks with my hands and feet in the air, I can only imagine that   I looked like a blue bug.The rain started as I descended the last rocks. It was pouring as I crossed the road to the store. When I reached the cabin I was soaked.","Woody Gap

We wanted to try a local place for lunch. There was a parking place on Main St. right in front of a cafe. Oops, it was closed for vacation.  
Just a few doors down we saw Clinchfield Pharmacy advertising a lunch special.  We walked into the pharmacy and back in time. 
The stools, the milkshake machine, the menu of grilled cheese and egg salad sandwiches all could have been there for 50 years. Even the prices seemed to be from a bygone era. The lunch special was a hamburger steak-the kind you make at home with real beef not a perfectly shaped patty made from who knows what. It came with green beans with pieces of real bacon, and mashed potatoes. Yes, they start with potatoes, not a package.  
The special included a roll, a drink, and a homemade dessert. Dessert was a Butterfinger or Mounds yum yum.
The waitress, who was also the cook described a yum yum as similar to a cheescake. Whatever the name, it was fabulous!The cost was only $5.95 for everything described above. 
Back in time? The only visible connection to today was a sign asking one to follow the pharmacy on Facebook.","Erwin, TN
