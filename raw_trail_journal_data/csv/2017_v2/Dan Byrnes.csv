Dan Byrnes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555381,"After months of planning and years of daydreaming, I’m heading out in a couple weeks to try something new. My next move is a bucket-list item: an attempt at a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. As I’ve been making my rounds telling people about my plans in the last few months, I’ve received plenty of questions. Here’s a few that come up often:
Q. What’s a thru-hike?
A. Oh yeah, whoops. Like everything, backpacking, and in particular, backpacking the Appalachian Trail, has its own jargon. A thru-hike typically means backpacking from end to end, in one direction, in one year. Everyone has their own idea of what makes an authentic thru-hike. Traditionalists will say you must walk every inch of the intended trail. More liberal interpretations allow for things like aqua-blazing (canoeing or kayaking parallel to the trail) and slackpacking (backpacking with only the gear you need for the hike). I’ll probably fall somewhere in the middle.
Q. Where are you starting?
A. Georgia! Roughly 90 percent of thru-hikers start in Springer Mountain, Georgia and hike north to Maine. Backpacking southbound means starting later in the year, and I’m ready to get out there!
Q. So how long will that take, like a couple months?
A. Longer! The typical thru-hike lasts anywhere from four to six months. Until hiker Scott Jurek broke the record by three hours in 2015, the fastest thru-hike was 46 days and five hours, by a fellow North Carolinian, Jennifer Pharr Davis. But these people are beasts and they practically ran. I just want to finish before October 15, when Baxter State Park (the site of the northern terminus, Mount Katahdin) closes for the winter.
Q. Going alone or with people?
A. Alone.
Q. All alone???
A. Yes. But don’t worry! I’m on my own schedule, but I won’t be alone. Last year, more than 3,000 people registered to thru-hike the AT. Hikers tend to fall into groups for periods of time, based on hiking pace, mutual interests, etc., and even if they don’t hike the trail together, they coordinate rendezvous points, shared campsites and shelters, towns to visit, and other activities.
Q. Are you going to have people join you along the way? Can I join?
A. While it sounds amazing to have people join for parts of my trip, it’s logistically really tough. A typical hiking trip starts and ends at the same point and consists of either a looped trail or backtracking. I’m not doing that -- I’ll be going northbound the entire way. It’s also tough to say where I’ll be at any given point. I have an itinerary, but it’s bound to change. So unless someone is able to find transportation at both ends of a section and is very flexible with their calendar, it’s hard to pull off. I’m totally open to your ideas and would love to have you join me.
Q. How are you affording to do this?
A. I wasn’t lucky enough to have a leave of absence approved by work, so I had to leave my job. I recognize that I’m extremely privileged to be able to do something like this. As for the finances, let’s just say I skipped enough happy hours to afford the time off.
Q. How many miles will you average in a day?
A. Hard to say, but probably something between 10 and 20. I’m sure I’ll start out slower than I’ll be mid-way, and will slow down/speed up as elevation and trail condition change.
Q. What will you do for food and water?
A. I’ll carry enough food for a few days at a time and hike into towns along the way to restock or pick up packages of food and supplies I’ve already mailed myself. I’ll carry enough water to make it to the next water source, where I’ll filter water.
Q. Are you bringing a doggo?
A. Maybe next time!
Q. Are you going to be blogging?
A. Yes! This is it. I finally got around to it.
Q. Are you going to write a book?
A. Would you read it?
Q. Will you have a trail name?
A. Probably! A trail name is usually given to a hiker by other hikers along the way, so stay tuned!
Q. I know literally nothing about this. Is this like Wild?
A. Kinda! Cheryl Strayed (aka Reese Witherspoon) thru-hiked the PCT, basically the AT of the West Coast. I hope I’m at least a little more prepared than she was when she started. If you want to know more about the AT, I totally recommend reading Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods (It was also made into a movie.). Better yet, listen to the audiobook -- Bryson is hilarious. Jennifer Pharr Davis’s Becoming Odyssa is great, too. And if you’re seriously considering doing this yourself, read David Miller’s AWOL on the Appalachian Trail. Or just check out the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.
Q. What can I do to help? Can I mail you things?
A. I would love to get stuff from you along the way! I can only carry so much at a time, so anything that’s light but big on calories and/or protein is great. If you want to mail something, let me know and I’ll send you my mom’s address -- she has graciously agreed to help ship resupply packages along the way. Also, if you know someone who lives along the trail and likes taking hikers in, hit me up! Other than that, you can really help me by sending encouraging texts, voicemails, and emails along the way. I’m sure there will be days when I think everything sucks and I want to quit, so your words will help. Just don’t tell me to come home! You can also send me music (hit me up for my collaborative Spotify playlist), podcast, and book suggestions (here’s my Goodreads request)!
Q. What are you looking forward to the most?
A. That’s really, really hard to say. I’m looking forward to sleeping outside, meeting people, and accomplishing a goal. If I had to pick, I’d say most of all I’m looking forward to being unplugged. Not sitting behind a desk for eight hours a day, five days a week. Getting out of the habit of reflexively reaching for my phone. A break from the news.
Q. What do you think will be the toughest part of the experience?
A. Ooh, good preparation question. Probably the mental aspects. Being alone for long stretches of time, dealing with the loneliness, frustrations, and discomfort, and reasoning with myself not to give up. I’ll need your help!",,I quit my job to backpack the AT. Ask me anything!,"Mar 01, Wed",0
Dan Byrnes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556523,"Someone mentioned to me that my last Q&A post didn't cover an important question: why are you doing this? Why are you taking time out of your career to hike 2,200 miles in the United States, when you could be doing anything else with your free time?I thought tackling that tough question deserved a full post.There's the chicken-and-egg answer: I've always wanted to do it. Ever since I learned about thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail -- maybe when I was about 11 or 12 -- I thought it would be such a memorable expedition. Then I listened to Bill Bryson's A Walk In The Woods, an extremely funny account of two unprepared and unfit Brits attempting the AT hike. Then I joined a backpacking club in middle school. Yes, a middle school backpacking club. Looking back, I don't know how the hell anyone put up with 50-70 middle schoolers on weekend backpacking trips without anyone dying, but that's the strange club I decided to join. We did two-week stints of the AT each summer, covering between 150-200 miles each time. Again, not sure how we did this at age 12 and survived, but we did. On those trips, I met thru-hikers and was equally intrigued, disgusted, and inspired.So that basically covers why I want to do it, but not why now.I added it to my bucket list in middle school, but I only seriously started considered crossing it it off my list in the past three years.I've realized that that there's no perfect time to take on this undertaking. With commitments of putting everything on hold for around six months and saving up thousands of dollars, it's hard to fit into any schedule. No matter what, there's no ""perfect"" time to do it. David AWOL Miller hit the nail on the head in his book: ""Hiking the AT before joining the workforce was an opportunity not taken. Doing it in retirement would be sensible; doing it at this time in my life is abnormal, and therein lay the appeal. I want to make my life less ordinary.""Last year, I was able to spend lots of time with my grandmother before she passed, so I'm thankful I didn't do it then.This year was far from perfect - I had to quit my job, give up a sweet apartment, leave DC, and miss a few weddings and other big events. But I couldn't even think about putting it off another year. And the more I thought, read, and talked about it, the more it materialized. There was no going back, and I had already made a huge accomplishment -- committing to the 2017 thru-hike.Quick actual update: Two days complete. About 18 miles covered. One almost-sleepless night in a shelter in the single-digit degrees suffered. 15 people in said shelter shoved.","Hawk Mountain Shelter
