Milkman and Quackers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642927,"Went white water rafting with Garza in Tennessee and stopped for lunch on the way to Amicalola Falls State Park.  Got there around 6:30pm, and began hiking the approach trail.  We got to the top of the stairs and the sun was already beginning to set.  We hiked a short distance, looking for the first campsite, but there were already several tents, so we continued on about another quarter-mile to the next campsite.  There were a couple tents there, as well, but we found a spot and set up.","Amicalola Falls State Park - Approach Trailhead
