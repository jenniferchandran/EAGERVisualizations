RavenShoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529493,"On Thursday we arrived late to Pen Mar, found county park closed with no water ""Stole"" water off a ladies porch (left a $5) then proceeded on the hike of no return up a mountain made of rocks, by the time we started down the other side it was getting dark and started to rain Raven saw a campfire we threw the tent down and climbed in, trying to collect rain water because we were so thirsty. Got up this morning in pain, met our neighbor pastor randy who brought some youth with him told us he does this every year and intends to they hike. Bless that man. Met a vet carrying dog tags of buddies killed in Afganastan, he stared Jan1., very passionate people here, kind and helpful. Thanks to all.","raven wood shelter

RavenShoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529641,"If Thursday was brutal, and Saturday was torturous, today was cruel. Left Crowell shelter at 10 am after a night of sleeping on rocks, mat and sleeping bag slid down tent, very exciting. Met nice folks, privy was full so had to wilderness it, cooked heavy food. Yesterday did the Amelia Earhart thing have sent tent to ship home with stranger and asked her to drink a beer for us. Tonight did AE and gave away some food, everyone says we can do 11 miles tomorrow. Will load photos of rocks, have no idea how many mountains we did. We became AT angels tonight and helped out guy who had huge blister and needed more than a band aid. Hope tomorrow is better and rocks aren't huge, big and menacing. Everyone asks esch other why they did this...interesting answers.","monday is dahlgren

RavenShoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529836,"Day 4: we are still alive and now working on the other side of the map. Left pogo at 9:25am after watering up, hiked several mountains made it to Annapolis rocks in record speed and then we hit the countless ""stairways to heaven"" rocks! And that did us in, so what could have been an ok day, it went to horrible, which is better than brutal. Had incredible cold water at the original Washington monument, which was closed to lightening. We basically shoved our bodies under the well water, and the only motivation for the miles, was the next campsite which has HOT SHOWERS!! At 1pm we made it to south mtn., at 2pm the whining starts, at 2:30pm there was a need for an ice pop and we missed the visitor center, the concession stand and the ultimate insult the old stone restaurant was closed cause it was Monday. No veggies, no coca cola...by 4pm we hit the wall and our bodies broke down. 50% less body pain now has moved to our feet. Recap: Distance to designated shelters---day 1, AT says 4.1miles, we did 5+, day 2: AT says 5.2 miles, we did 7.8 don't remember yesterday's...today AT indicated 11 miles, we did 13. Our feet are very aware...photos next","pogo campground

RavenShoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530069,"Day 5: hiked from Dahlgren to rock run and waited out storm for an hour that never came.   Hiked to Gathland SP met ""kilt man"" hiking, a day hike tour group of 20 ""road scholars"", and several women thru hiking. Fresh water at Gathland and cool place to sit a cold water pump and really sore feet and knees and we couldn't do one step more. So we will be back (Shoes will be back) to finish the last 10 miles another day. Enjoying waffles at hostel can barely walk...","dahlgren

(photo) Still deciding on clothes since the weather is much different that what we were expecting and not sure of the final temps.(photo) Going to do a practice run this weekend and balance the load. We are in better shape than last year, know what we are doing and are packing lighter. Getting excited!",,2017- Hartford on Wednesday,"Apr 20, Thu",10
RavenShoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561565,"Well, our trips to Publix to get the pack weighed are almost done. It doesn't matter because what we have is what we have, however, I have had my share of ""Amelia Earhart"" moments when I don't want to bring anything at all...I actually weighed everything. I should be at 29 pounds but for some odd reason I'm above, I thought my pack was lighter then it is. $200 for 2 pounds, hard decision, maybe next year when REI is open...food is all freeze dried, down to hardly any clothes, I was told to bring deodorant or I don't get to sleep in the tent. The only new item is the solar panel to charge the phone...of course we need sun, and the weather indicates rain, go figure. I did find a little area in my pack to stowe small items, that was cool. Made it easy to stash the stuff. Repacked the pack several times to get the balance right -I think I have it now. Tuesday night we stay at the airport, flight is so early it makes it easier. 
Hope we have pre-flight status.

RavenShoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561853,"Made it to Salisbury after a flight delay because of a broken baggage handle, 45 minute delay, cloudy and overcast. Walked around town, picked up fuel in General Store, got lunch at the Bistro, sewed a button on, recharged phones resting-got no sleep last night. Staying with Vanessa B. Very nice accommodations, getting coffee on way in morning. Added photos.
8:13am filled up with mountain water at city hall and began the hike, did 11miles, filtered some water, goal was to get to toy maker cafe with free camping, coffee tomorrow! Dinner st 5:30pm, in tent by 8 pm, calves and knees hurt probably didn't drink enough water. Weather held to clouds, started out misty and drizzled in morning with fog. Small towns full of NY folks.
