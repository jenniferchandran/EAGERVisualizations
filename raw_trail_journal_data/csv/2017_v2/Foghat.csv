Foghat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552683,"Just trying to see if I am going to like this means of chronicling my upcoming hike/adventure. I have been backpacking for many years. But always short duration hikes of not more than a week. But in those years I have hopefully learned a few things that will also make me a successful long distance hiker. I was able to instill a love of the trail into my son who completed all miles of the AT in 2012. But I had to wait till I ""grew up"" and entered retirement. So, now with about 3 1/2 months to go before launch day, I am ready and excited. I will be doing a ""flip flop"" hike. Starting in Harper's Ferry and going North and then returning to Harper's Ferry to walk home to Georgia. I am looking forward to sharing this here and hope that those who choose to read will feel the same sense of wonder, the excitement, the freedom, the appreciation, that I will feel.

Foghat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553055,"Physical fitness has been a part of my life for many years. Still I realize that I am carrying 15 - 20 pounds too much body weight. So, in preparation for my hike, I have stepped up my workouts especially with regard to my legs. So, by start date I should be stronger and lighter. Yes, I know that the trail itself pretty much does this for you. But I really want to avoid some injury at my age that could make this a failure for me. Currently reading Balancing on Blue by Keith Foskett. A very good read about his AT hike.","

Foghat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553915,"There are definite milestones that occur in a person's life. I passed one in my life a couple of days ago. I hung up my stethoscope. Having practiced medicine for 35 years, I now leave it behind and reach for other pursuits. Such as my backpack. I have always participated in hiking but usually for just 3 or 4 days at a time. No more than a week. Now I can concentrate on preparing for the trials and blessings of a long distance and long duration hike. My wonderful co-workers will have an AT map in the office and I will keep in touch with them and others so that they can follow my progress and live the trail vicariously though me. I hope that I will be able to adequately convey the wonder, the hardships, the beauty, and the personality of the trail to all who wish they could walk with me.So, still looking at an April 16 departure date for my flip flop hike starting at Harper's Ferry.

I am making a real effort to make sure that not only am I ready for this journey mentally and physically but also that my wife and family are ready. I have been very busy doing projects around the house and making sure that all ""my"" stuff is done or will be taken care of so she is not burdened with it. I will provide maps to several friends and family members so that as I progress on the trail and call them, they can mark my location and follow along with me. I have also asked them to write a note on a post-it note next to the map so that when I return I can see what was going on in their lives while I was at a certain place. I am looking forward to seeing the threads of those lives intertwine!","

In truth I will be temporarily leaving one home and going to another home. I am at home in the wilderness and will feel welcome there. Not to make light of the challenges, but merely seeking to paint a positive outlook for the benefit of those who don't know or don't understand. We will be leaving next week and heading toward my Easter Day start at Harpers Ferry. I am very appreciative to those who have been so supportive and encouraging. I even appreciate those who think I am crazy! Maybe I am! In a good way. Maybe my ""maturity"" will be a help to someone else on the trail! There is another ""Foghat"" on the trail this year.

Seems like I kept meeting ""mature"" folks, like me! Graybeard, Old Growth, Ten Steps. 11 mile day for day 1. On trail by 7:30 next day in the rain. Still can not help smiling all the time! Did 14 miles and limped into camp with very tired legs and sore feet. Stayed at camping area with family of five including one nursing. Slept so good! 48 degrees next AM. Met another very mature hiker who said that his trail name was ""Meandering Snail"" because he was in no hurry! Love it! Every body tells tales of the rocks in PA but let me tell you the rocks of MA are no slouch either! But they are the kind that want to trip you up or hurt your feet. Today the 19th has been rainy and overcast. Tonight will be first night in a shelter. Almost 5 and no one else here yet. Need to know if I am doing things right. Met ""Chef"" today. Young and from Atlanta. Said he started at Springer 2/19! Two months and he is already here?! My thought for the day has to do with art.

Foghat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561057,"ResupplyI made my way over a few lesser mountains and mountains of Pennsylvania rocks (refrigerator and car size). Yesterday I came hwy 30 and a planned stop in Fayetteville, PA. The manager of the Scottish Inn came to pick me up and I booked 2 nights. The place is kinda rundown but the people are very nice and accommodating. The Flamingo restaurant is across the street. So today is a zero day and my first trial of resupply. Well, Walmart is it. I asked the manager of the motel to drop me off and give me two hours so I could study and read labels and such. Also there is a Subway in the store that sounded good. After the allotted 2 hours I was picked up with three bags of groceries that I needed to break down into a manageable size and weight. I am sure I have overdone it. I was aiming for 5 days of food. But it just looks like so much! And now I have to carry it! But my legs are getting stronger and more patient with me. Thinking about the next resupply being Duncannon,PA and maybe even the famous ""infamous"" Doyle Hotel. That will be in 4-6 days. Between here and there is the Pine Grove Furnace State Park and also famous ""half gallon challenge"". That is where those who have completed the halfway point (unlike me who is just still a newbie) are challenged to eat a half gallon of ice cream in as little time as possible. So far my miles are 58.8 miles traveled in 6 days including the zero. That is an average of less than 10 miles per day and I need to be at between 15 - 20 to finish in 6 mo. It will continue to get better!! Love you all, Foghat","

Foghat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561646,"24 AprilSpent last night in Iron Masters Mansion. A hostel in Pine Grove Furnace State Park. Only 4 of us there and we all knew each other. Had pizza for supper, slept ok. Then waffles and bagels for breakfast. Got a fairly early start at 7:40 and wound up close to 16 miles. You have heard there is a thin line between pain and ecstasy or love and hate. Today was wonderful and very painful. I loved the parts of the trail over soft black soil. And also over the condominium sized boulders. But the trail (most) was also over and made of the smaller (softball sized) rocks that hurt my feet tremendously. So I arrived at Alex Kennedy Shelter and am with Smitty, Michelle (a guy that seems to be a permanent hiker of some trail or another) Vesper ( a young post grad female with a skinned head on the sides) and Jack (a young flip flopper). Expect more rain tomorrow. Trying for 18 miles and also a stop along the way for some more camp shoes as my Xero's broke. Again. Talked to DeAnna, Tammy, and Susan! 25 AprilTalked to Mike today. Woke his but up at 8:30 AM! I was walking though a field at the time. Did 18 miles today. Most through agricultural fields, some with huge areas of beautiful yellow flowers that I later learned to be canola! Then the last 2 miles were a steep ascent to get to the shelter. It is as if the makers of the trail just wanted to remind us we are still in PA. Tonight is the Darlington Shelter known for its Taj Mahal privy. Haven't seen it yet. Will let you know. Here tonight is an older married couple Cowboy and Furby, Smitty, Jack, and me. I had the honor to give Jack his new trail name - Red Walker! He was excited! Tomorrow will be a 12 mile day into Duncannon. Planning to zero there on Thursday too. Passed 100 miles today! Only 2000+ to go!","

A large double seater. And the second seat was not in service. I have never seen two people want to use a privy at the same time anyway. What it lacks in decorum it makes up for in size! Still, just a large privy! I am in the world famous Doyle Hotel. Not much on cleanliness but cheap! And good food! Today's walk was treacherous over rocks and steep trails. 12 miles. But with some good beer and hamburger in me, worth every step. I will zero tomorrow and wash some clothes and let some stuff dry out. Been very wet rainy and sweaty. I guess I have lost some weight. My pants are looser. I have a pull thing that helps tighten them but it is maxed out. So they hang a little lower. Not quite like those idiots who show butt crack at McDonalds. But still the ""boys"" in my pants have room to play! Need some safety pins to tighten them up. I had an experience this morning I need to let you know about. I got up and was on the trail by 7:15. It was in the cloud at first. As I descended I was so struck by the absolute beauty of the light green leaves of Spring on the trees in contrast to the forest floor with brown leaves and gray rocks. I love that! It is so beautiful! And I thought, ""Who am I that I should see this?"" And I was suddenly completely overwhelmed by a presence that made it hard to breathe. And the answer came to me as clear as a bell ringing in answer to my question. ""You are my child. Brother to my Son. This is yours! It has always been!"" I was in tears, streaming down my face! I don't know how else to describe it but as walking in the presence of my God! I walked onward for a couple of miles with the very strong presence of a loving God who reached out to me. I did not seek that but it was granted to me none the less. Now, my pastor, Stephen and my friend David, I am sure could make a more complete message of this but I am humbled to have received this and I will carry it always. I am where I was meant to be!

Foghat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562105,"April 27I am sitting in a laundromat in downtown Duncannon, PA. I walked 12 difficult miles over very rocky terrain yesterday morning and got into town by 12:30. The trail goes right through the town and the white blazes are on street signs and telephone poles. I got to The Doyle Hotel, famous in hiker lore, and got checked in by Vickey. I asked her how she was and she ""Old, fat, and ugly, how are you?"" I said, ""Well, I am not fat."" After a shower I had a great hamburger and a beer and went to my room for a nap. Met three of my hiking buddies in the bar downstairs for supper. Today is a zero day. Resting my feet, laundry, eating. Will be looking into arranging a shuttle tomorrow AM to take Smitty and I 17 or so miles north of here where the AT crosses Hwy 325 (I think). Then we will hike back with no packs, called slackpacking. We will stay one more night at The Doyle and then get the shuttle to take us back to the same spot Saturday morning with our packs to head on north. Got some nice guest book comments from dear friend Vicky and also a Vicki I don't know. I am very appreciative of the comments and support! But I don't have the email addresses available in the guest book entries. But if you want to comment or ask a question that you don't want on Facebook then use that. It is on the left side of the screen when you are reading the journal. Thanks a bunch!! Having a little trouble figuring out how to do my zero days. Feels like too much wasted time. Maybe a Nero (nearly zero) coming into a town by noon, check into hostel or motel, eat, shower, laundry, sleep, eat, resupply and back on trail by noon next day. I guess it will depend on when I get in and what's available. Still figuring this out. A little restless today. Foghat","

The slackpacking we did yesterday went well. It was nice to hike with only 10 to 12 pounds on my back vs. 28 to 30. And I got in 17 miles. The thing that made it tough was that I was walking at about 130% of my usual pace. We didn't get started till 9:15 and I needed to be back by 5 so I could get ready to meet some friends. So I stayed with Smitty at his hyper speed and that got me done on time but very tired. 
Dan and Beth, long time friends from my Navy years came from their home 45 miles away to pick me up and took me to supper. It was nice to see them and such a great time together. The meal was fantastic too!! Hope to see them again. 
We heard that a young local man in Duncannon fell to his death night before last from Hawk's Rock which is the place from which I took one of my selfies a day or two ago. It was foggy the morning I was there so you really could tell what a cliff it was. Sad! 
Tomorrow planning on 12 to 13 miles to the 501 shelter. Close enough to a town where if we wanted we wanted we could call for pizza! Don't think I will though. Won't completely rule it out though.

Alive!
My days are spent walking and facing life at its most basic levels. Food, water, shelter. I love it!!
Total miles today 12. Total so far 170. Averaging 11.33 miles per day when you include the zero days. 
I temporarily lost the trail today. I was walking under Interstate 81 marveling at the engineering involved in building an Interstate overpass and I missed my left turn to go up the trail on the other side. Had to back track a third of a mile or so when I discovered my error. Oh well. 
Today as I was walking a song kept going through my head. You remember a song from long ago called, ""Signs""? It was by Five Man Electrical Band"". The last verse was something like:
I saw a sign on the door, everybody welcome to come in, kneel down and pray. 
When they got to the end of it all, I didn't have a penny to pay. 
Got me a pen and paper, made my own little sign. 
Thank you, Lord, for thinking about me!
I'm alive and doing fine!! Whoooo!

Yesterday was warm and overcast. I knew a storm was coming and was wearing my raincoat in spite of the heat. Then it didn't rain. Smitty and I pulled into Eagle's Nest shelter after 15 mile day. There were 3 others there we enjoyed chatting with while putting out our bed rolls and preparing our dinners. This shelter is one of the smaller ones but 5 can sleep on the floor comfortably. Usual bedtime for hikers is 7:30 to 8 o'clock and hiker midnight is about 9 o'clock. Well, at 9 a hiker comes up to the shelter using his headlamp to hike by. With the storm coming we really couldn't have him set up his tent so we all scrunched up to make room. It worked but too close for me. Especially since I had met this late arrival before and knew him to be someone who frequents bars in the towns drinking till late and then hiking at night to a shelter. Most everyone you meet on the trail is super nice and supportive and encouraging with similar mindsets and goals. But occasionally you meet one you would rather not meet again. But since he is headed North also, I am sure we will meet again. 
The storm finally hit last night and the rain was very heavy but we stayed cozy as snoring sardines and dry. 
My friend Beth, whom I have mentioned before when she and husband Dan took me out, met Smitty and I today where the trail goes through Port Clinton. She drove us to the motel and waited while I showered and put on my less dirty clothes. She joined me for lunch and then took me Cabella's and to Walmart for a few items I needed. She is a true trail angel and I am so appreciative of her visit.
I now have some new crocs to put on at the end of a hiking day and also a hydration bag with a hose I can get to easily to encourage me to drink more during the day while hiking. I am sitting in my rain pants and my down puffy jacket as I wash my clothes.  Plastic rain pants are really not all that comfortable with nothing underneath!!
Back out tomorrow after the motel breakfast!!

Staying at Eckville shelter. When I arrived Smitty was talking with  very elderly man named Don. Don is a trail angel. He goes to different shelters with a trunk load of various local cheeses, sausages, sweets, etc. and gives them away to hikers. Won't accept any money. Says it has already been paid for by our Lord in heaven. And he is just His servant!!
We went over the 200 mile mark today!
Today we started out with a steep climb out of Port Clinton. Got you warm and sweaty right off the bat. Then, on reaching the summit a very cool and refreshing breeze greeted me. Made my nipples stand up and say, ""hello."" Had some good vistas today too. Especially Pulpit Rock. 
Planning on a 17.4 mile day tomorrow and watching an approaching storm that may cause us to seek a town on Friday.

Long tiring day over treacherous, awesome, exhausting, rock. You would not believe what the trail goes over and through. I did pause to have a FaceTime conversation with my daughter, DeAnna it was fun to show her the rocks and the cliff I was on. Also paused to buy a sandwich from a restaurant visible from the trail where it crosses 309. To tired to cook tonight. Had some trail mix, cheese, and Nutella. It will start raining tonight and last a while. Headed into Palmerton tomorrow. ","

Cinco de Mayo! 
I am temporarily trapped in Palmerton, PA. By weather. It started raining last night and kept on raining through the hike today. The  Appalachian Trail became the Appalachian Stream!! It was so intense and slippery. I tried to take a picture of it but my phone would not recognize my rain swollen finger print. In any case, I am safe in Bert's Hostel which is attached to Bert's Steakhouse where they serve all meals. The rain continues tomorrow so I will stay here another night before attempting the rocky cliffs that the trail takes north of here. I am told that you must put away your trekking poles and climb using hands and feet. Joy. 
A thought about rocks. You can not beat them. You cannot defeat them. You can however, negotiate with them. You must promise to consider speed, friction, and balance, and IF you get the right combination you may pass. Of course rain adds a whole new entity. So far, I have done ok with the negotiations. I hope it continues. But it will not be a victory. It will be a truce. 
Went down the street a bit for some beer and Mexican Cinco De Mayo food. Great guys! Good time. We will see about tomorrow!

You try to make your best plans with the best information you can get. Weather predictions were consistently bad for Saturday and so we stayed in town because we knew that the climb out was very demanding. As it turned out the weather was not nearly so bad yesterday and was not nearly so good today! Bert's was absolutely fantastic!! Very hospitable, comfortable, accommodating, and the restaurant had excellent food! 
The climb out of Lehigh was on very steep rocks using hands and feet like on a step ladder. Over rain wet rocks and even a brief bit of sleet! Over 1000 feet up in less than a mile. Done, fist bump, and move on. Total of 15 miles today over rocky terrain. 
First chance to use my rain pants today. Royal blue! Match my coat. A couple with a big black collie came around the bend and the dog went crazy barking at me. I guess in the blue I reminded him of a mail man! 
Looks like we will be going a little over 20 miles tomorrow and we will be in Delaware Water Gap where I hope to get a package from Tammy. Then the next day we enter a new state!
There is a freeze warning tonight in this area. Taking precautions with our water bottles and filters.

I am learning to use an app on my phone called, Guthook's AT guide.  Gives you all sorts of useful information like where the shelters are, water, views, etc. And it uses GPS to show you where you are on the trail and how far you are from those useful items. Cool!
Last night at 2:30 Smitty and I were awakened by a scraping sound. We both got our lights on to see if some acrobatic mouse was trying to get to our food. Nothing. 10 minutes later, same thing except Smitty saw the culprit. It was a porcupine gnawing on one of the steps to the shelter. We made noise and scared it off a couple of times but it kept coming back. Finally I bopped it on the head a couple of times with a broom handle. That did the trick but my sleep didn't return either. 
I saw 4 or 5 Scarlet Tanagers today! They are a very beautiful bird I have only seen once before. Look it up so you will know what it looks like. This was my blessing today! 
I did 20.1 miles today and am in Delaware Water Gap. Have to wait till post office opens in AM to pick up package from Tammy. 
May 9
Waited till PO was open and got the package Tammy sent. It had the next section of my guide book along with a few things I could not use like lotions, creams, and a soaking powder for aching feet. They would have been nice to have last night in my motel room!! There was also some food stuff that I did put in my backpack. We will try to plan better next time. 
I crossed a very long bridge over the Delaware River and thus left Pennsylvania behind and set out to claim New Jersey! New Jersey is beautiful!! Such gorgeous panoramic views from open mountain tops. Rocks refuse to respect state lines but they are less frequent and they don't seem like they are trying to kill me! I walked 15 miles today and am a total of 285.5 miles into the journey. Smitty is back about 4 or 5 miles so I am tenting all alone. There are more bears per square mile in New Jersey than in any other state the AT goes through!","

I am in Mashipacong Shelter tonight, so far by myself. It was a 21.6 mile walk today! Also, I went over 300 miles total today. My average is now 12.8 miles per day when you figure in the zero days too. I have in my head that it would be best to try to summit Mt. Katahdin sometime the first week of July. Tammy is scheduled to come spend a week with me in New Hampshire starting on July 8. I don't want her to have search me out of some unknown place in deep Maine in order for us to be together. So, in order for that to happen I need for my daily average to be 15 miles even with the zero days figured in. I should be able to do more miles in the next few states before I get to the White Mountains. 
Midday I was crossing a highway and less than a hundred yards away was a tavern! I grabbed a quick grilled ham and cheese sandwich and a beer and was energized for the climb out of that valley. 
Also today, I saw a very large black snake who was highly offended that I interrupted his slither. He coiled up and even started shaking his tail even though he had no rattles. 
Heading into Unionville, NJ tomorrow to tent camp and get a couple of things at the store. 
May 11
I am in Unionville, NJ this afternoon. I went 14.3 miles today and it sounds strange to call that a ""light"" day. But it really was. I was here by 2 PM and am camped in their city park. They don't have showers or laundry but I am comfortable with about 4 or 5 other hikers. Horler's Grocery is where hikers sign up to camp in the park but they didn't really have any hiker type stuff in their store. I found some Ramen noodles and tuna to cook another day. I walked down to Wit's End Tabern down the street for possibly the best ribs I have ever had. Wit himself sat down with me and filled me in on town history. 
Saw the forecast for Saturday is a lot of rain and cold. Trying to plan for that. 
I'm now into my 4th week of this journey and I have slowly but surely collected my ""trail legs"". That is when your legs and heart and lungs all begin to feel ""normal"" with the demands placed on them by the trail. My muscles are giving me no back talk what so ever. Still the maturity of my joints is sometimes an issue. But even that is better too!

Today has been a very varied day. I have been walking through lowland marsh areas over board walks. And also up 1000 foot climbs over rocky mountains. Saw a deer, saw some geese swimming with goslings in tow like a little train of rubber duckies. It was a 16.8 mile day and my total so far is 338.2. 
A rain storm is coming and will likely start at 4 or 5 AM. I will probably suit up like a mailman again and at least aim for the next shelter which is a little over 12 miles away. Then I will decide whether to continue based on the weather and the terrain and how difficult the hike has been. 
Smitty is back with me and some others here also. 
A little secret I'll tell you. Sometimes I talk to birds. When I hear them they sound so pretty. And I tell them that. And thank them for singing to me. It's the little things.

I am at the Wildcat shelter after a totally NUTS day of 12.1 miles of very difficult trail over a rocky mountain pathway that required putting away the poles and using hands and feet to climb. One place actually had a iron re-bar ladder to climb 10 - 12 feet. It might have been a more fun day if it had not been raining the whole time making it especially dangerous. Also it never got above 49 degrees. 
However I am pleased to announce that I have crossed over into a new state!! I am in New York now.  YAY!

So yesterday was Mother's Day!! I placed some calls to the appropriate mothers in my life right from the trail while I was stopped refilling my water bottles. My miles yesterday were 14.3 and I wound up at the Fingerboard shelter. I was supposed to go on another 5.3 miles to the next shelter. But I was beginning to have some pain in my left lower leg, just outside the shin bone. Then it began to rain and sleet and I said Nope! Done for the day. I took some extra Aleve and slept well. I got an early start from a crowded shelter, very quietly packing my stuff up and cooking my oatmeal and coffee. My did ok at first but the pain gradually increased and had me limping by halfway. Took more Aleve. It is the anterior tibialis muscle if anyone is interested. There was no specific injury. I just walked - a lot. I had to climb and descend a few mountains today. From one I was supposed to be able to see the skyline of Manhattan off in the distance. Couldn't. 
Anyway, I am at the Holiday Inn Express shelter (motel) in Fort Montgomery, NY after a 15.5 mile day today, bringing my total up to 380.1. It had been 9 full days since my last shower. Not by choice. Just no places to get off the trail and have such a service provided. I will, unfortunately have to take a zero day or two because of my leg. I will stay off it as much as possible, take Aleve, use ice, to see if I can coax it back into working order. 
Smitty and I ate at a barbecue and steak place a couple of doors down and they had shrimp and grits, and also sweet tea!! Well, bust my britches! You just don't find those things up here north of the Mason - Dixon line!!

Zero miles!! Still at Holiday Inn Express shelter. Have had leg elevated, iced, for most of day. Reading and TV. Blah! I did have to get out and walk a mile and back to post office. The leg is better. Not well, but better. Planning on getting back out there tomorrow for less than 10 miles.

6 miles on trail today for total of 386 miles. It was a 1.8 mile walk to get to the trail. So I kept my promise of less than 10. My leg hurt but not as bad as on Monday. It is pretty swollen from about mid shin down to the ankle. Still it was good to get off my butt and on the trail. Thank you all for the words of encouragement and prayers on my behalf. It meant a lot to me. 
In western parlance I have a ""hitch in my giddy up!"" A saying you hear frequently on the trail is, no rain, no pain, no Maine. Well, if that is so, then I am headed to Maine!!
But this injury has caused me to reconsider my plans stated a week or so ago. I may not be able to finish Maine before Tammy comes up. But I will do my best to make it as easy as possible for her to find me, no matter where I am. 
I am renting tonight at Graymore Spiritual Lufe Center. A place where some monks allow hikers to camp on their softball field. 
When most people think of New York they automatically think of the city. But let me tell you woods and mountains of NY state are awesome!! I will likely cross over into Connecticut over the weekend.

13.8 miles today which officially puts me over 400 miles!! 400.3 to be exact! I hiked a slow steady pace over undemanding terrain. Began solo but caught up to Whale and Spot and spent most of the day with them. Wound up at the Fahnestock State Park to camp.  We caught a ride with a couple of other hikers with a car to a restaurant where I had some lobster ravioli. It was wonderful. 
Very hot today - 93 degrees. Hoping for a cool down soon. 
Leg hurt after halfway point but didn't swell much.  Progress?

I am at the Morgan Stewart Shelter after a 14 mile day. 414.3 total. My leg was very painful today. It was torture getting to the Mountain Top Deli at about 12 miles. But I had a great roast beef sandwich and a huge Gatorade. And after a little rest made it another few mikes to the shelter. I had hoped for a 16 mile day tomorrow but I am. It so sure. We'll see what the leg feels like doing. Frustrating. 
Still hot today but the wind is blowing and the temps are supposed to drop tonight into the 50's and then only into the 70's tomorrow. That's better!!

Staying at the very full Wiley shelter. There are also 8 tents set up including mine. I walked 16.6 miles today for a total of 430.9. And I am happy to report that my leg feels better than it has all week! I got an early start and the trail was mostly easy in this area. But I was very careful about every step and at Jack's suggestion I crabbed or walked sideways down the hills. Even occasionally backwards. Maybe a day or two more and I hope it will all be back to normal!!!
About mid-day I came to a highway crossing and I knew there was a deli a little over 1/2 mile away. So I tried my hand at hitch hiking with immediate success! A man quickly pulled over and ran around to the passenger door of his pickup and started throwing all his tools in the back seat. He took me to the deli and then waited for me to get my order and then took me back to where he had picked me up!! Angels!!
Tomorrow will be interesting. I will be approaching an area that has been closed due to fire. I have heard that the fire is out but they will still probably detour me around the area. Also I need some groceries and other supplies. We will see!

I am at Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter. The mileage today was 19.7 and total for the trip is 450.6. 7.1 miles today were by car because of the detour around a wildfire. I am now firmly in the embrace of Connecticut! The trail started very easy as a welcome to the new state. I came to where the detour began and saw that it would mean a 7.1 mile walk on a very busy highway. Nope. Hitchhiking time. Got taken to Kent where I bought a few things I needed and had a wonderful southwest salad and some ice cream. Then back to the trail for some pretty difficult hiking including a very steep descent down a wall. The last 2 miles were along the Houstatonic River and since no one was around I took advantage and did a little skinny dip to wash me and also my clothes with some camp soap I have. It felt great!!!
I have pushed my leg more today and it did very well!! I think it will be back to normal and well within a couple of days. 
Everyone wish my darling daughter DeAnna Mayo a happy birthday! Tomorrow is her special day!

I am tenting at Belter's camping area tonight. Alone so far. There is a light rain falling but I was able to get my tent up before it started. Connecticut started off very mild so far as the trail goes. But then she took off her gloves. Some pretty steep and rocky ups and downs. The forests are beautiful! I have seen hundreds of chipmunks over the last few weeks. Alvin, Theodore, and Simon have lots of brothers and sisters. And they don't wear those silly long dresses or smocks or whatever those things were. The trail demanded a lot of my body and I am tired but my leg did well. I didn't baby it today and it performed faithfully. 
Tomorrow I am planning on walking 9.8 miles and into Sallsbury, CT. Hopefully I will be there for a good lunch and then stay in a hostel for the night getting a shower, laundry, groceries, charge up my devices, eat a couple more times, and then back out on the trail.

I am at Vanessa's House in Salisbury, CT after 9.5 miles today making me 475.4 total. 
I will add the missing mikes to my trail journal to see if that corrects the difference. 
Vanessa takes in hikers and puts them up in a room in her home. There are bunk beds for 4 people but so far I am the only one here. She did my laundry and I took a shower and hung my wet tent out to dry. Then I went looking for something to eat. Problem is, the restaurants within walking distance are closed on Tuesday!! There was a bakery/sweet shop open so I had a brownie and ice cream and the ordered delivery from a place that brought me a hamburger and fries! I found a picnic table and chowed down!! Happy!! I then bought some groceries and other supplies and am ready to get back out there tomorrow. Looking forward to another meal tonight and breakfast in the AM. 
The trail today was a mix. Climbed one mountain. But mostly easy with some good views.","

I am at the Hemlocks shelter eating my ramen to which I have added tuna, olive oil, and cayenne. Hmmmmm good! I walked 13.8 miles today after having a biscuit and a cinnamon roll from Sweet William's treat shop for breakfast this morning. Total miles are 489.2. The shelter is fairly large with bunks and also a loft area. It will sleep 10 easily. So far (5:35) there is only one - me. It is on a hillside surrounded by big hemlocks and a spring just below where I got my water. 
Today's hike was up, over, and then down two significant mountains.  My legs got a real workout. But there were also some great views from the tops. While I can always show you a great view from the top of a mountain, please don't take for granted the amount of work it took to get there. And the valley floors and pathway to the top is mostly beautiful too. 
I saw several more chipmunks, a deer, and tried to imitate some birds that were singing to me. Maybe God will translate. 
I crossed another state line today. I am now in Massachusetts. The stream that marked the boundary was gorgeous!! The pictures that I show you on Facebook to announce a new post are only the ones I have taken with my phone. There will be hundreds more taken with my camera that will show more beauty than a selfie!!!! But I won't get to go through that process till I get through and back home.

Tonight I am with others at the Mount Wilcox South shelter. I did 19.7 miles today bumping my total over 500, to 508.9. Today was a drizzly, cool, windy day that took me over a couple of smaller mountains, through pastures, next to a river, and also a jog through a low lying wood where hoards of millions of ravenous, vampire, mosquitoes wanted my blood in a desperate way. They were horrible! I survived but if they had caught me I would have looked like one of those mummified corpses in the Indiana Jones movies. Going to be cold tonight and more rain. Need to wrap up tight in my bag!

I am at the Upper Goose Pond Cabin tonight. 15.8 miles today and 524.7 total. It rained all night and most of the day. The trail was soggy and with many standing pools of water. All the streams were swollen. Mosquitoes were hungry. And the rocks and roots were wet and slippery and conspiring to make you slip onto your backside or worse. And yes, I did a couple of times. Still it was a good day. 
I saw probably over a hundred of these eggs you see in the picture. Beautiful. 
This cabin is maintained by the ATC and has a caretaker who is on site. I am responsible for my own meal tonight but tomorrow the caretaker will be making blueberry pancakes and coffee!!!

I am at the Kay Wood shelter tonight. 17.6 miles today and 542.3 total. I am now just 5 miles short of completing 25% of the trail. Yay!!
No rain today but the trail was still very muddy and soggy. The terrain was mild. My socks from the day before were soaking wet so I tied them to the outside of my pack so they could dry while I hiked. I lost one. Shoot!
Last night the cabin was full. All beds were taken by folks trying to get out of the weather. This morning, Pete, the caretaker, was up early fixing pancakes and started serving at 5:45. They were great! Pete is also a retired MD. A radiologist who also spent time in the Navy as an undersea medicine specialist on one of our nuclear submarines. I enjoyed swapping stories with him!

I am tenting at the Crystal Mountain campsite. I walked 7.2 miles today and am at 549.5 total. Today was intended to be low mileage semi-rest day. I got on the trail this morning and went 2.8 miles into Dalton, MA. I stopped at the Juice and Java for breakfast, coffee, juice, and battery recharge. All was good and then hiked about 4 1/2 miles to the campsite where I have pitched my tent. Looks like more rain is coming so I am glad I got it done before it started. No one else is here yet. Tomorrow I should be well rested and fed to take on Mt. Greylock, the tallest mountain in MA. (3491 ft. )
I learned a couple of things over the last few days. 1) Do a better job when you tie your socks to your pack. 2) Quit trying to avoid the mud on the trail. Go ahead and get your shoes muddy and your feet wet. It took way too much time and effort trying to find ways around or over the muddy areas and Vermont will be even worse. And also the two times I fell wasn't because of mud. It was because I slipped on a rock or root trying to beat the mud! Lesson learned!!

Wilbur Clearing shelter 
16.3 miles today and 565.8 total. 
I broke camp this morning and headed downhill about 4 miles & then through Carlisle, MA and then toward Mt. Greylock. It was raining nearly the whole time. Mt. Greylock is MA's tallest and as I climbed the temperature dropped to between 40 - 45 and the wind was blowing 10 - 12 mph. COLD! My exertion kept me from hypothermia but when I got to the top I found there was a lodge and restaurant. I didn't know that. What a blessing!! I went inside and asked where they wanted me to put my pack. But my hands were so cold I couldn't undo my buckles. I finally got it off and ordered a hamburger and a Russian Imperial Stout. The girl wanted me to sign the receipt and gave this huge pen that I gripped like a child holding a giant crayon. I did my best but could not read my own signature. Maybe like someone from Coldasheckeslavia!! There was no view from the top with the rain and foggy cloud cover. Now I am lower on the mountain and out of my wet stuff. Tomorrow I am headed into Williamstown for 2 nights, rest, cleanup, laundry and a little shopping.

Zero day. Staying at the Williamstown motel resting. All cleaned up and re supplied. I also got a package from Tammy and bought some groceries from Walmart. I used Uber for the first time to get to Walmart. Ahmad, my driver does the driving when he is not looking after his kids since his wife works. So when I finished at Walmart there were no Uber or Lyft drivers available so I took a cab.

I got here a little after 3 but decided not to push another 6 miles to the next shelter. So tomorrow's plan is to aim for a shelter 18.7 miles away. My knees and ankles have been hurting most of today. But on a positive note, I am now in Vermont! The famous Long Trail and the AT share trail space for the next 105 miles. Vermont's reputation for mud is well deserved. Black gooey mud that tries to pull your boots off. I saw 2 or 3 garter snakes today and I also got really close to a momma and child porcupine couple. How do porcupines mate? Very carefully!!! Besides the mud, the woods and the trail through them are beautiful!!

I went 18.7 miles today to get to the Kid Gore shelter. That is 601.6 total. I had some pretty steep ups and downs today. I am tired and was glad to see the shelter. One of the benefits of doing a Flip Flop hike like I am doing is that you get to follow Spring. I just keep on seeing such beautiful blooms in the woods and next to the trail. Also, now that I am further north I am seeing more evergreen trees. Fir I think and they are pollinating. There is a grayish green dust all over the trail and rocks. The picture of my boots shows mud, the dusty pollen, and wear. I am glad you can't smell them! The white straps are flea and tick collars. One way I try to prevent ticks and Lyme disease.

I didn't see the resort. Must be on the other side of the mountain. There was a caretaker up top who was delighted to talk for a while letting me know about the names of a few things blooming right now. There are some very annoying gnat-like bugs that are swarming right now. And they bite like crazy. You have to be covered up or covered in DEET. The caretaker also recommended going into Manchester Center tomorrow for resupply and lunch. Think I will. Will have to hitch a ride though.

Actually I am at a laundromat in Manchester Center, VT right this second. I did 10.7 miles to get to a highway and then hitched a ride into town. Ate at a burrito place and walked to a grocery store and now  washing some clothes. At home my washer is on the left and the dryer is on the right. Well I moved my washed clothes to another machine thinking I was going to dry them only to find out it was another washer! It wasn't marked. Now they are correctly being dried and hopefully I will be able to get a ride back up to the trail and hike another 2 miles to the next shelter listed above. Always the adventure!!

I am at the Little Rock Pond shelter after 17.8 miles and a total of 647.1. 
It rained all night so the trail all day was mush, water, mud. This morning it was still foggy, drizzly, and cold. The first mile was to climb to the summit of Bromley Mt. which is a local ski area. At the top the fog was so thick I could not see more than 25 - 30 ft. ahead. I found the ski lift and a warming hut. But I could not find where the trail continued. So I used my phone app, Guthook's AT guide and its GPS pointed out the way and I was back in business. 
Let's talk about animal droppings. I know you have been wondering for years about this. Most of you know what rabbit pills look like. Well deer poo is very similar in size but in larger amounts. The picture you see is of moose droppings. Size is like large grapes. Large volume. The moose seem to be very productive, fecally speaking. I did not see any moose. Just their leavings. Aren't you impressed?!

I am soaked at the Clarendon Shelter after 13.6 miles making my total 660.7. 
It poured rain most of the night and during the whole hike. I am now in the shelter and it is still raining. The trail was very muddy, rocky, rooty, and slippery. I fell twice. Now, since no one saw me, I am not obligated to admit that. But confession is good for the soul - Once! After that grace abounds. Roots laugh at you when you fall. Rocks don't care. They have no sense of humor. But you can fall over a slippery root and hear it giggle, giggle. 
There was one stream crossing I had and it was raging from all the rain. And the crossing was 15 yards above a very angry looking waterfall. There was no safe way. Just jump in and walk. In cases like that there are very few appropriate words. ""You want me to cross that?"" The S word is entirely called for. I personally prefer the two syllable version spoken so well in the south. Sheee-it.

Finally, some good weather! The sun was actually out today. I had to get reacquainted with my shadow whom I have not seen in several days. And the temperature was in the upper 60's and lower 70's. Very nice! I climbed Mt. Killington today and went to the very peak for some pictures. One I posted today. (Yesterday?) Vermont has been the worst state so far as keeping a cell phone signal. I do try to keep in touch and keep posting but it isn't easy. The climb was hard and of course the trail is still sopping wet. Shoes sock and feet never get dry. 
I use Mom's Stuff (https://www.momsstuffsalve.com/) on my feet at night. A good smelling, soothing, healing, salve made by Lee Bennion in Utah. We met Lee when Tammy and I rode miles to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. She was there and we hiked with her and some of her Utah friends. She makes a wonderful product and sells it online.

I am apparently here alone for now. Not even any manager. I had to find the washing machine on my own. Sitting on my room in my rain pants since EVERYTHING needed washing. And I have what seems to be the usual weekly shower. Another nice day. No rain for now but I understand it is on the way. I said good bye to the Long Trail today as it split off from the AT and it heads in up towards Canada while I head towards New Hampshire. 
I walked to a deli very hungry and they sold the usual sandwiches but also some breakfast stuff. I told them I had been in Vermont for over 100 miles now and still had not had any pancakes with real Vermont maple syrup. Well she took pity on me and fixed me some French toast with maple syrup and didn't charge me for it!! I also bought a sandwich, a beer, and groceries there. So nice!

I had several climbs today. It is still a very beautiful forest and a little less mud today. It tried to rain early in the day but that fizzled out. It is interesting as you walk through a forest to see how the types of trees change as you go from one side of a mountain to the other, wet vs dry, north vs south. Always a competition for the predominant species. And of course, man's role can't be ignored either.

Got into the shelter later than normal. I have had supper, cleaned up a bit, and am now ready for bed. The weather today was clear but hot for hiking at 85 degrees. A few miles were over open fields and pasture land. I found 3 ticks on my lower legs. No where I was wearing my treated clothes. The reason for the high miles today was the spacing of the shelters. One was at 11.6 miles and then next was this one at 20.4. No in between. I have a blister on my left little toe I will have to deal with.

Today was a light day to make up for yesterday. I made my way into Hanover and across another new state line, New Hampshire! It was a hot day!! But Hanover is all about Dartmouth College graduation today and I could hear the names and majors being announced as I went by the school. I found a place that gave me a free doughnut because I am a thru-hiker. Then I went to a restaurant and had a good meal and desert. Then I stopped by a co-op for some groceries and then up to the shelter. I am tenting tonight because of bugs. Last night I set up my tent inside the shelter to protect me from the vicious mosquitoes. 
I will need one more shipment from Tammy before she comes up here next month. I will need the next section of my guide book, Maine. So we have been planning on my progress and places I might stay to see the best place to ship to. I have some anxieties about the White Mountains and how I will do in them.

And the temperature was between 85 - 90 in the shade of the forest. Hot, hot, hot!  I drank lots of water. I even took my shirt off and soaked it in a stream and put it back on to help cool off. Dipped my hat in the water too. It is supposed to cool off on Wednesday with morning temps down into the 40's. That is much better! New Hampshire is where the real meat of the big mountains are on the AT. In figuring my daily itinerary I have to consider the mountain I have to climb, how big, how tall, the weather, how I feel, and location of the next few shelters, campsites, or towns. It can get complicated.

I did 15.7 miles today to wind up at the Jeffers Brook shelter. That is 762.1 total. Today was almost perfect! The temperature was low 50's when I got up and I was on the trail by 5:30. I started by climbing to the peak of Cube Mt. which is 2911 ft tall. It is neat when you have a vista and can see where you were yesterday and the curvy ridge line by which you got to where you are. I saw lots more moose droppings but no moose. I don't think I will ever see moose tracks ice cream quite the same. A little over 5 miles into the hike I came across ""The omelette man"". He was about 100 yards into the woods from where he parked his truck on a gravel road. He was set up under a tarp and had a Coleman stove and everything he needed to cook you an omelette or pancakes. I turned those down but sat and talked with him while I ate a cookie, a cinnamon bun, two boiled eggs, a banana, coffee and juice!! What a wonderful surprise!! I got started back in my way and he said he would check out my trail journal. Then, 5 miles later, I came to the highway I wanted and with another meal and some groceries on my mind I stuck my thumb out. The first car pulled right over! 4 people in a van took me 5 miles to Warren, NH but all the restaurants (2) were closed. So they dropped me off at the convenience store that had a deli. After a sandwich and doing the best I could with their poor selection of groceries I was ready to go. Standing outside with my pack on, I asked a man if he might be going towards the AT. He said it was 5 miles in the opposite direction but to hop on in. He was glad to help me. Trail Angels everywhere!!!

The climb really didn't seem difficult and I was at the summit by 8:30 or so. I was there alone for 40 minutes before a day hiker showed up. The steep descent was harder and slower. I got down to Kinsman Notch and then climbed to Dilly Cliff and then climbed again to Mt. Wolf. I couldn't catch a break on the descents. Tough and slow.  Finally reached the shelter at 6pm. A 12 1/2 hour day. Makes me wonder about some of the mileage goals I have for next week. Especially through the Presidentials (mountains named after presidents). I deliberately kept the mileage modest because of the terrain. But maybe not enough. We'll see.

9 mile walk today and 787 total. I am staying at The Notch Hostel. Needed resupply and a clean up. But had to do a little hiking up and down Kinsman peak first. It rained all night and was pouring when I left the shelter this AM. When I reached the summit I was wrapped in a cloud and couldn't see anything so far as a view goes. Also the wind was blowing hard enough to make balance a problem. So off I went the other side. The lady who runs the hostel picked me up and took me into town and to their hostel, gave me a tour and a bed. I took a shower and got my laundry started and she took me to a shopping plaza where I was able to resupply on groceries and eat a steak!!! Will be back on the trail tomorrow. There are a couple of guys here I have hiked with before too. 
Life is great!!!

I am at the Garfield Ridge Shelter and did 10.4 miles today and am at 797.3 total. 
Today was awesome!!! First, I can not say enough good things about The Notch Hostel. Super people and great place. I had waffles for breakfast this morning. Then had a ride back to the trail. Today's hike started at Franconia Notch and climbed steeply up to Franconia Ridge which included Little Haystack Mt. at 4800 ft..Then a ridge walk above the tree line to Mt. Lincoln at 5089 ft. and Mt. Lafayette at 5283 ft.  Then the trail dropped back down to about 3700 ft. and then climbed back up Mt. Garfield at 4458 ft.. The view from the ridge today was stunning. Above the clouds and super beautiful!! All the climbing and descending has me pretty tired. Yes, I did remember to use sun screen. I had a lot of exposure to the sun for several hours today. 
June 18
I am at the Ethan Pond shelter after a 14.5 day and 811.8 total. The peak I reached today was South Twin Mt. at 4902 ft. There was no view as the whole area was covered by clouds and fog. Then there was a slow down hill walk and even flat for the last 4 miles. Very unusual. But tomorrow I begin my planned two day assault on Mt. Washington. If the weather allows. Rain and thunderstorms are predicted. I am planning a 14 mile day and stopping at Lake of the Clouds Hut tomorrow. I will hopefully stay there using ""work for stay"" (where they let you stay there and eat leftover food their guests didn't eat and you do some sort of assigned task for them) or stay in their ""dungeon"" (cellar). 
The Appalachian Mountain Club or AMC runs all the huts and several camping areas. There have been some strained relations between thru hikers and hut staff in the past. But the AMC reached out this year and offered a deal to thru hikers where after they paid full price at one camping area all others would be 50% off. Plus if you stopped at a hut you could get a free baked good up to 2, or a bowl of soup. I used those privileges today and found the food excellent and the staff friendly and helpful. 
Looking forward to tomorrow! Oh, no signal for my phone most of the day. I was able to get a call to my Dad for Father's Day early this AM. But nothing since.

I am at the Lakes of the Clouds Hut after 13.9 miles today and 825.7 total. BIG climb today. I dropped down into Crawford Notch and then started on the climb toward Mt. Washington. Along the way I got to Mt. Webster at 3910 ft., Mt. Jackson at 4052 ft., Mt. Pierce at 4312 ft., Mt. Franklin at 5004 ft., and now I am at the hut at 5047 ft.. I will do work for stay and then continue on over Mt. Washington tomorrow. The weather was so so today but no real rain. At the higher elevations the mountain tops were thick with fog and clouds. So no great distance views. But the the fog and the wind gave the trail a more ominous feel. It was pretty cool!! The Hut staff is very nice and there are about 6 of us thru hikers waiting on our assigned work for the evening.

I am at the Joe Dodge Lodge in Pinkham Gap after 15 miles today and 840.7 total. In our work for stay last night we got a wonderful meal and then the 5 of us were put to work. I was assigned the task of scrubbing some of their dish drying racks which had some mold starting on them. We worked for a couple of hours and then were told that was good and we slept on the floor or benches in the dining area. I got up early again for what I expected to be a long day. I climbed the remaining altitude to the summit of Mt. Washington at 6288 ft. It was very windy and encased in cloud with only 30 - 40 feet of visibility. The picture of the weather report shows you that we were experiencing gusts of up to 70 mph. It was also raining a little. After leaving the summit, I skirted Mt. Jefferson and eventually made it to Mt. Madison. Then I descended along a very exposed, narrow, rocky ridge. The wind was fierce and the gusts made it scary. I would be trying to concentrate on my footing going steeply down and the gusts would throw me off balance. Then the gust would subside and I would be overbalanced the other way. I was scared a little but got down with no falls. The only comic relief involved my pack. The chest strap has an emergency whistle on it. When the wind gusts came so strong, they would make the whistle blow. I hear ya, buddy!! 
I am loving the beauty and challenges of the mountains in NH but the strenuousness is tiring me. I have planned a 13.3 mile day tomorrow and of course it will be climbing a lot. But then the next day I am headed to a hostel in Gotham and will zero the next day. Need some rest.

I am ready for bed at the Imp Campsite. (No comments please) I did 13.1 miles today and have 853.8 total. 
The meals I had at Joe Dodge Lodge last night and this morning were soooo good. Got me off to a good start this AM. Guess what I did. I climbed mountains. In order there was Wildcat peak E, Wildcat peak D, Wildcat peak C, Wildcat Peak A, Carter Dome, South Carter Mt., Middle Carter, and then North Carter Mt.. Whew!! It took me 11 1/2 hours to do that. I was tired and hungry and knees aching mostly from the descents. But the trail was beautiful. There were some great views. And the weather was perfect. So, a great day. Going back to the mountains I mentioned, it looks like a Bonanza for the Carter family. Wonder who they were/are? I have non signal tonight. One of you can look it up if you like. 
I am doing a short 8 miles tomorrow to a hostel near Gorham. And also taking the next day off there too. I need to give these joints some rest and eat some more good food. 
June 22
Today I walked 8 miles to White Mountain Hostel near Gorham, NH. Got checked in and a quick shower. Put on some borrowed clothes they have while they wash my clothes and then got shuttled into town to a restaurant where I have had some wonderful seafood and probably the best clam chowder ever. I will need to get some groceries a little later but I am satisfied for now. 
I understand that Smitty and Skyman will be arriving here this evening. I am interested to find out how they are catching up with me after they rented a cabin back before Mt. Washington. I think they are slackpacking. It will be good to see them again. 
Today is my sweet sister's birthday! She is now younger than her daughter since she did the reverse birthday thing several years ago.

I am at the Gentian Pond Camping area after a 11.8 mile hike today and 873.6 total. It was a good relaxing stay at the White Mountain Hostel. I got some good meals, a little TV time, resupply. After a waffle breakfast this morning I got back on the trail in a warm and humid air. I was soon sweating like a pig as I climbed out of Gorham. But soon the skies cleared and a breeze at higher elevations cooled things off. The hike was pleasant. I am not planning on long hikes from here and throughout Maine. There are not really big climbs like in NH but it is rough and wilder and I just want to enjoy it as much as possible. Tomorrow I will cross the border into my last northern state! I'll try to get a picture if there is a marker or sign. The next big event will be the day after tomorrow when I reach Mahoosuc Notch. A notch is northern talk for a sharp V-shaped valley. Mahoosuc is such a valley but is filled up with a mile long stretch of car sized rocks and boulders that make for rock hopping, caves, and havoc. It is called the most difficult mile of the entire AT. Some say it is the most fun. I hope I am up for it. A couple of other notables - 2 weeks from today Tammy comes up here for a week long visit. Yay!!!! Also tomorrow starts my 11th week of hiking. Still going! 
June 25
I am at Full Goose Shelter after 9.6 miles today and 883.2 total. 
I am in Maine!! Wet, muddy, rugged Maine. I went less than 10 miles and still it was a full day for me. The weather was good mostly. I thought it was going to rain but it blew over. The trail is very rugged and slow. There is a lot of mud. I thought I knew mud from Vermont and NH. Today as I was walking along a ridge with already soaked shoes, socks, and feet, I came to the end of a board over a wet place and there was mud. No big deal. Happens all the time. You step in the mud and keep on going. You can imagine my surprise as I suddenly found myself in a mud pit all the way up to my upper thighs! My eyes were as big as saucers and the ""boys"" were scared! I am sure our old friend, the ""S"" word was sudden on my mind and lips. It took some doing to extricate myself from that. And some cleaning up at the water hole once I got to the shelter. Tomorrow is Mahoosuc Notch. Wish me luck!!

I am at the Baldpate Lean-to. It was a 12 mile day and 895.2 total. 
Don't let the ""lean-to"" throw you. Just different terminology for the same structures. I started off the day with and survived Mahoosuc Notch. It was a very difficult mile. It took me 2 hours. I left some skin behind. I took a hard fall which left my left shoulder, hip and foot sore. Nothing broken and it all still works. I also lost one of my water bottles, scratched my watch, and cracked the screen of my camera. But overall, I felt pretty good about my effort and my winning. I had a couple of mountains to climb after that and 12 miles got me to the lean-to at 5:15 this evening. 11 1/2 hours on the trail. I am seeing several orange slugs on the trail up here. I know I have told you that sometimes I talk to the animals that I meet. I don't talk to slugs. What do you say to a slug? How's Jabba?
Getting very low on food. I need to get to a town for some groceries tomorrow or the next day. 
June 27
Staying at Pine Ellis Hostel in Andover,Maine for the night. I got to a road and needed resupply of food. Also the clouds looked ominous. So I decided to stay at a hostel recommended by both Smitty and Skyman. I am clean with clean clothes and had a wonderful hamburger for lunch. Will head back out tomorrow hopefully with fewer sore areas.

I am in my tent near Bemis Stream. Mileage was 17.2 today and 920.4 total.
I feel great!! No hurting or pain from the fall a couple of days ago. I mostly loved the trail today even though it was rough, rocky, muddy, and occasionally steep. That's just Maine.  I had some good meals in town and a ride to the trail this morning. I forgot to mention that I saw two moose yesterday. I had already come out of the woods and was walking down the road waiting on a car to come by so I could hitch a ride. A Momma moose and her calf crossed the road ahead of me. Exciting! 
You can read some trail journals that emphasize all the challenges and hardships of the trail and how miserable the person is. Yes, I hate it when those durn, sneaky, slippery roots make me fall. But my goodness, what a life this is! The beauty, the activity, the scenery, the wonder of the creation from the beautiful mind of a loving creator!!! Most people you meet on the trail are happy and excited about what's next! I am so privileged to be here!
June 29
I am at the Piazza Rock Lean-to. It was a 20.8 mile day and 941.2 total. 
Believe it or not, today's walk was pretty easy. For Maine. No real great elevation changes or big climbs. Still lots of splashing through mud and water and the feet stay wet all day. Trying to take care of them. Using Mom's Stuff. It really helps. I have enjoyed seeing several SOBO's (south bound hikers).  They respect my age and my experience on the trail. They ask questions about what is ahead. They are in awe of my mileage. Some were envious of my moose sighting. The black flies seem to be ending their season but the mosquitoes are really hungry here. Constant battle. Tomorrow I will tackle the Saddleback mountains and The Horn tomorrow but I will keep my mileage down to just 8.9 unless I really feel good about continuing on after the climbs and descents. Bad weather coming in. May affect plans.

I am at the Poplar Ridge Lean-to. Only 8.9 miles today and 950.1 total. 
I climbed 3 mountains today. Saddleback, The Horn, and Saddleback Junior. It rained most of last night, so of course, the trail was wet, rocky, slippery, muddy, and rooty. But it was not a hard day except for the descents which always slow me down. I fell a couple of times and left some of my DNA on the rocks. Par for the course. I met a couple who are doing a thru hike with their 15 month old baby. Nice couple and the baby was happy and healthy. She was cute walking with her Dad's hiking poles. The views from the mountain tops were all cloud. No vistas at all. It is foggy now and rain is expected. Tomorrow I will climb Spaulding Mt.. Then I will finish up all available food I have. The day after (Sunday) I will make my way into Stratton where I will resupply, and clean up. I got to make several phone calls today too! Always good to talk to people you love!

I am at the Crocker Cirque campsite after 14.2 miles today and 964.3 total. No Lean-to tonight. I am in a campsite and have my tent set up on a wooden platform. There is a group of about ten 10 year olds here also but they are quiet and across the stream. I had to make good time today because rain was predicted to start at between 2 and 3 o'clock. I got here at 2:45 and it was beginning to sprinkle. But I got my tent up quickly and everything covered. Now I am just waiting on the rain to stop so I can fix some Ramen noodles and tuna and then hang my food bag from a tree. 
Tomorrow I start by climbing both South and North Crocker Mountains and then it is downhill into Stratton where I will stay a night at the White Wolf Inn. I need groceries and a clean up.

I am at the White Wolf Inn tonight. I did 7.3 miles today for 971 total. 
Boy!! Last night was a doozy!! I got into the camping area just in time and pretty soon after I got my tent set up the deluge started. I had to cook and eat in my tent which I don't like to do and then sounded like I had set my tent up in a waterfall. It rained so hard and for so long. I stayed dry and comfortable in my tent but everything I am carrying was wet and some saturated. I was out of any kind of food so I got started early and was on the trail by 5:15. I climbed both of the Crocker Mts. and reached the second peak before 7 AM. I made it to the highway by 10 but then had to hitchhike and it was about the 12th car that picked me up. So I am checked in and have had lunch, washed me and my clothes, bought groceries, and recharged everything. Oh, and trimmed my mustache, manicure, and pedicure, read a paper, and now just relaxing. Will repack the pack tonight and be ready to hit the trail tomorrow. My baby is coming to see me!! 
July 3
I am at Little Bigelow Lean-to after going 15.3 mikes today and 986.9 total. 
I know everyone has their own opinions but I think my favorite mountain range so far is the Bigelow range. I summited 4 peaks today, two of which were over 4000 feet. The views were outstanding!!  The trails were great and they didn't try to BE the feature. They were there to get you to the features which were the mountains. That is not always the case. Sometimes the trail planners try to make the trail so ridiculously difficult and challenging that you don't get to concentrate on the place you are in. 
The hard rain caused some of the rivers to get high enough to be very difficult to cross. Smitty and Skyman are here tonight too and they said they had to wait about 5 hours for one river to go down enough so they could ford across safely. 
We are planning to go 17.7 miles tomorrow to get to a shelter near a camp where we can get breakfast the next day! 
July 4
No signal tonight at Pierce Pond Lean-to. It was a 17.7 mile day which puts me over the  thousand mile mark at 2004.6!!!! Yay!
Happy Independence Day! I hope that you all will celebrate well! 
Today was somewhat high mileage but over fairly easy trail. Mostly flat but with some sections that were very muddy and wet. There was trail magic along the way in the form of chocolate chip cookies, raspberry white chocolate cookies, snack cakes, and apples. Very nice. Where we are now is near a cabin that is going to fix us a big breakfast in the AM. Also very nice. The shelter is on a very large pond. Some of the ponds here are of course natural but several are man made from the days when much of trade was from canoes so that access was easier to villages and towns. Also transporting of troops. Interesting history. 
Tomorrow I will make my way into Caratunk. Hopefully I will have a signal and can post.

I walked 4 miles yesterday after that wonderful breakfast at Pierce Pond Lean-to. I reached the Kennebec River for which the ATC has hired a person to ferry you across in a canoe. Safely across, I came into Caratunk with Smitty and Skyman. We walked to a nearby hostel famous for its milkshakes and had some. Then came the tough part. While I am so very happy that I am going to get to see my beautiful wife for the first time in 3 months, I also had to say good bye to two hiking buddies that I may never see again. It was harder on me than I expected. When I get back on the trail and especially once I get to Harpers Ferry to start going south I know I will meet other folks and friends. But I will miss those two. They have been great! 
I am at Northern Outdoors for two nights. I thought about doing a slackpack today but decided to give my abused feet a break and instead went white water rafting on the Kennebec River. It was fantastic!!! I really enjoyed the river, the views, my raft mates, and get this, half way through we pulled over to a beach and got fed! I had steak, three bean salad, stir fried rice with veggies, cookies, and lemonaide. There was one good picture of me in action that I will share when available and also I got interviewed for the video because of my hiking the AT! It has really been a good day! 
Tomorrow I get to go to Portland, Maine by shuttle so that on Saturday I can meet my bride at the airport. I may not post much about the next week. We'll see.

It has been a full and restful and wonderful week spent here in North Conway, NH with Tammy. We have had some needed time with each other and also seen some unforgettable and beautiful sights. Today we will be traveling back to Caratunk, Maine where I left off the AT and stay one night at the Sterling Inn. Then tomorrow morning, probably in the rain, I will resume my hike and Tammy will drive back to Portland, Maine from where she will fly back home.  
I will have 2 days of hiking to get to Monson, ME and I will stay in a hostel there to get supplies for the section of the trail called The Hundred Mile Wilderness. It is right at 100 miles of woods with very limited access and no places to get off for resupply. So you have to carry food and fuel enough to get you through it. There are signs that will warn you to carry 10 days of food. I have made plans for a 6 day trek through it. I have no idea if there will be a Verizon signal in there but hopefully I will be able to keep in touch. 
After the 100 mile wilderness I will be almost to Baxter State Park where Mount Katahdin is. Climbing Katahdin is the epic climax of the journey for those hikers who started their journey in Georgia. For me it will be the epic halfway point! Once that is done I will start the complicated travel to get back down to Harpers Ferry and the southward bound walk back to my home state. 
So, don't give up on me. Please continue to follow along with me and I will try not to bore you. Let's go for a walk!!

Today is my Dad's birthday!! Happy Birthday, Dad! 
14.7 miles today and 1023.3 total. I am at the Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to. Today was not an easy day at all. It was very hard to say goodbye to Tammy. We have had such a wonderful week together in New Hampshire. I had a total of 9 days off the trail and eating great meals 3 times per day. We walked some but nothing like what I was doing on the trail. So, that added together made me somewhat less than motivated today. Still I got in some good miles over a pretty easy trail. It was tedious in places with slippery rocks and roots. It rained today too. But. I am back in the saddle and I expect my mood to improve. The day after tomorrow I will be in Monson to get ready for the hundred mile wilderness and soon after that preparing for Katahdin. I'll get excited soon. 
July 16
I am at the Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to and did 13 miles today and have 1036.3 total.  
I am getting my legs back in shape and felt better on today's hike than I did yesterday. But after fording a couple of streams and the frequent mud bogs my feet are complaining with some raw areas. I now have them bandaged up and hopefully ready for tomorrow. Much of today's hike was next to a beautiful and wild river. Occasionally it ran next to large rocky bluffs over the river. I also climbed to the summit of Moxie Bald Mountain this morning. I met a few trail maintainers hard at work and thanked them for their hard work and service. 
Tammy made it back to Atlanta last evening and stayed at our niece's house and got to visit with her sister, Sharon and husband Adam. She will go back home today. 
Tomorrow I head into Monson. 
July 17
I am in Monson, ME at Shaw's after 6.1 miles today and 1042.4 total. I feel good mostly and I will have to deal with my feet. But I am in a good place for a resupply and a good night's rest before getting into the wilderness tomorrow. I have visited with the AT center in town and know mostly how to deal with Baxter State Park and Katahdin in a week or so. So, things are looking good. Still haven't made concrete plans for travel to Harpers Ferry but much of that will depend on when I actually get to complete Katahdin. 
Signal is difficult up here so I do not know if I will be able to post or not after tomorrow. I will try though. I definitely want to share pictures of Katahdin as I approach it and also with me on it!

I am at Long Pond Stream Lean-to after a 18.4 mile day and 1060.8 total. There are different kinds of halfway marks. Though I am not at my northern terminus, I am getting very close to the halfway mark so far as total miles goes. The mileage of the entire AT is 2189. So when I reach 1094.5 that will be one of the halfway points. Completing Katahdin will be the other. 
I got a late start this morning because of the wonderful breakfast served at the hostel this morning. So, 9 AM on the trail made for a long day and a late arrival at the shelter. The trail was beautiful but I had to ford four streams which took some time. Because of the feet problems I decided to try to keep my socks and shoes as dry as possible. So that meant having to take them off and put them back on for the fords. Oh well. But my feet are better! I am feeling good with good energy even though it was such a long day. Time for bed!
July 19
I am at a campsite on the West Branch of the Pleasant River. I did 15.2 miles today and am at 1076 total. Today was a mountain climbing day. I climbed Barren, Fourth, Three and a Half, Third, Columbus, and Chairback mountains. Much up and down. Another long day. Very tired. There were no streams that I had to ford but a few I could rock hop across. It was a hot day too. So I was really careful to drink lots of water all day. One stream was so tempting that I soaked both my shirt and my hat in it and put them back on to cool me. 
I had mashed potatoes and salami for supper along with a couple of cups of lemonade. Tomorrow I have more mountains to climb and also may have my first view of Katahdin from White Cap Mountain. Hopefully I can get a good picture of it in the distance! 
July 20
I am at the East Branch Lean-to after 16.7 miles today and 1092.7 total. NOW I am over the halfway point regarding mileage. It's kind of like when you had to share a cookie with a sibling. Someone always complained about getting the ""small"" half. There are a few more miles in the section above Harpers Ferry and probably more difficult too. However, I am focused on getting to climb Katahdin in a few days and then will have the opportunity to walk home!!
Today was another busy day. Started off with a fording of a wide but shallow river and then the climbing began. I climbed Gulf Hagas, West Peak, Hay, and White Cap Mountains today. The peak of White Cap was the highest and mostly bald. It was from there that I got my first view of Mount Katahdin. It's a big massive thing off in the distance. But getting closer step by step. 
Tomorrow I will be getting a food drop which is food I have already bought and am paying someone to deliver to me at a particular place on the trail. It has kept me from having to carry 6 - 7 days of food and helped keep my pack weight down. 
Still no signal. When I do get a chance to post y'all will have some catching up to do!
July 21
I am at Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to after 19.5 miles today and 1112.2 total. These days I am using my tent a lot because of how bad the mosquitoes are. 
Today was another long day but the trail was very kind to me. Mostly long flat sections with some areas of rockiness or rooty. There were a couple of small climbs but they were easy.  I have gotten my Trail legs back and am clicking on all cylinders! My feet are much less of an issue since I am trying to keep them dry and using liner socks too. 
The food drop occurred as scheduled and on time. It is good to have food for the next few days but now my pack is heavy again. Also today some one left some trail magic right in the middle of the trail a couple of miles from a road. I had some peanut butter crackers and took with me a small to go packet of peanut butter.  
I have probably said good bye to a couple I know as Poncho and Iggy. They will be slowing down a little as we approach Katahdin so their son can meet them there and climb it with them a day or two after I climb it. 
Another day without a signal!! I miss talking with Tammy each evening. I miss posting the journal and hearing your feedback. I miss being able to get a weather report. Oh, well.

I am at Rainbow Stream Lean-to. Mileage today was 18.2 and total is 1130.4. 
I finally found enough of a signal to call Tammy and post to my journal. I was at the summit of Nesuntabunt Mt. which also gave me a closer view of Katahdin than a couple of days ago. Cool. Should be an even closer view tomorrow. 
I met a group of young men, scouts, who are out hiking trying to do 200 miles in 22 days. They were very nice and respectful of all other hikers especially older ones like me. I appreciated that. I also met Graybeard who is 82 years old and trying to get the record for oldest thru-hiker. Impressive man!! 
Poncho and Iggy are here tonight too. But their schedule will take them elsewhere tomorrow.
The shelter has a gorgeous stream right in front of it. I washed my feet and legs and shirt. 
Tomorrow I will cut my miles to 11.5 and stay at the last shelter in the 100 mile wilderness before going into Baxter State Park for my date with Katahdin. Hoping to climb on the 25th! 
July 23
I am at the Hurd Brook Lean-to. I stuck to my plan and only did 11.5 miles today and 1141.9 total. I arrived here by 12:45. I got my tent set up, bed ready, clothes changed, water collected, and then relaxed under a tree to ready some of my Harry Potter on my Kindle. 
The walk today was not difficult but very rooty. There was one place where I had a fantastic view of Katahdin. I also saw a loon on a lake and he was very aggressively splashing his feet and wings probably to try to warn me off a nesting place. 
I am planning to get an early start tomorrow and go the 3 miles to get to Baxter State Park and eat breakfast at the restaurant and get some food to eat while climbing the next day. Then it will be 10 miles to get to The Birches which is the lean-to and camping area where only thru hikers can stay before their next day's climb. Excited!!
July 24
The Birches Lean-to inside Baxter State Park after 13.4 miles today and 1155.3 total. 
I am right beside Katahdin!! I stopped at the store right after crossing Abol Bridge which crosses the Penobscot River and had a continental breakfast with Poncho and Iggy. They have changed their plans to summit tomorrow with me because of rain predictions for the 27th when they originally planned to. Their son in North Carolina canceled his flight and will be driving here with a friend hopefully getting here by 7 in the morning to hike up the mountain also. 
I have not found Baxter State Park to be a very informative or customer friendly place so far. But Katahdin is here and that is why I am here. Tomorrow is the day!!!

The trail to the summit of Katahdin was 5.2 miles making my final mileage in the northern section 1160.5. Of course I had to walk back down (and that is more difficult than going up) but that doesn't count toward the final mileage. The weather was beautiful.  The trail was tough but one I have been prepared for by prior states and mountains. It was an emotional moment at the peak with the sign. I ate a snack up there and the headed back down. It was another emotional moment when I finally had signal enough to send a text to my family that I had been successful. And then again when I had to say goodbye to Poncho and Iggy.

Appalachian Trail Lodge in Millinocket. 
I treated myself to steak and Maine lobster last night. It was great! I am all cleaned up and washing clothes. The loaners I am wearing look silly on me. I have been making plans and reservations for travel back to Harpers Ferry. Shuttle to Medway, bus to Bangor, bus to Boston, hotel in Boston, Amtrak to Washington, Amtrak to HF, motel in HF. I will be using Saturday to getting my gear ready and resupplied. Then I plan to start south on Sunday the 29th.

Econo Lodge in Harpers Ferry. Well, I am well rested and fed. The trip down here by shuttle, bus, and train really went well. And though long, it was pretty comfortable and on schedule. The manager of the Econo Lodge took it upon himself to call me while was on the train between Washington and HF and offered to pick me up at the station. Which I really appreciated as it was raining. 
Today I went to Walmart for a food resupply and then to a an outdoor outfitter for a couple of things. A high school class mate who lives here in the area offered to pick me up and take me to dinner. I asked her if we could go to a place that serves southern fried chicken and sweet tea. 
While on the train I went over most of the next 300 miles or so of the trail in Virginia. It looks interesting and, to be truthful, easier than what I have been used to. We will see!

I am tenting at a campsite next to a spring at the beginning of what is known as The Roller Coaster. It was 16.6 miles today. The next 13 - 14 miles go up and down much like the teeth of a saw blade. Not huge elevation changes but just repetitive. 
I got started today after the free breakfast at the motel. The trail was relatively flat most of the time but also very rocky. These are the rocks that are ankle biters. Sharp and hurt the feet to walk on. Like what I started with in Maryland. The weather was beautiful today with clear blue skies and highs in the low 80's. 
I really enjoyed eating with Mary Jackson and Brady last evening. We tried to catch each other up on the last 40 years and had some good southern cooking at Cracker Barrel. She was to leave today I think for a trip to Tanzania. Remarkable!! 
I remembered today being back in the south during summer will need to be more careful to look for snakes of the poisonous variety!

I am at the Rod Hollow Shelter tenting tonight since the shelter is occupied by three folks who know each other and they are spread out. I went 13.8 miles today and completed The Roller Coaster. 11 climbs and 12 descents! The climbs were not outrageous but still, that is a lot of elevation changes for one day. The trail was rocky. It was also hot today. There was a good stream at about 8 or 9 miles to refill a water bottle and also to soak my shirt and hat in the cool water. I saw one long black snake. He is a good guy!! I passed several north bound folks. Only one seemed unhappy. It was a good day!

I am at the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter after 18.4 miles. This really a nice shelter! It has a front porch, a wooden couch, benches, covered picnic table for fixing and eating food and a solar shower which I took advantage of. 
Long miles today but I could not have asked for a better trail to do them on. It was mostly flat and very easy walking except for the last 3 miles. I saw 3 deer early in the day. One stayed long enough for a photo. 
If you look at the AT on a map, you can of course see that it goes north and south. But it also goes very significantly east and west. So when you are in the New England states your sunrise is much earlier than in the south. The sky starts to lighten up there around 4 AM. Now that I am in the south again it is still dark at 5! I have to adjust my starting times. Also it seems weird that the rising sun is now over my left shoulder instead of ahead and to the right. It has caused me to pause and think about whether or not I am going the right direction. Adjusting.

I walked 5.6 miles to a highway and hitched a ride to the Quality Inn in Front Royal, VA. I have been able to eat a couple of good meals, get a new SD card for my camera, go to the post office to mail some cool weather stuff home, buy groceries, do laundry and make a few phone calls. Productive day. 
People are asking about my feet. They are good! My issues were mostly due to the constant wetness and rugged terrain in Maine and all that has healed. Occasionally I still have some arthritis pains in the bones but not much. 
Tomorrow I will enter the Shenandoah National Park. All the north bound hikers I have talked to loved it. Beautiful and not too strenuous. The trail crosses the Skyline Drive several times allowing for opportunities to buy meals and practicing the art of Yogi-ing. Where you sit near a family on a picnic and look hungry so they feed you. Hmmmm. We'll see!

I am at the Gravel Springs Hut tonight after 13.4 miles. Kind of a short hike but interesting. I am reminded of that song from long ago, ""I don't like spiders and snakes, and that ain't what it takes to love me!"" Well, I personally don't have anything against spiders and snakes but if you get on a trail early and no one is hiking ahead of you, you are going to run into lots of spider and caterpillar web. Nice face plant sometimes. I picture myself as looking something like the Mummy with all the silk wrapped across me. 
I entered into the Shenandoah National Park and there was a self serve kiosk in the woods where I had to fill out a form to serve as my back country permit. The trail is great and the woods are beautiful. I came across a timber rattlesnake crawling across the trail about 20 feet ahead of me. I got close enough for a picture or two but he wouldn't smile and also never rattled at me. I also saw two wild turkeys. The feathered kind. 
Then after noon it started raining followed by a very intense thunderstorm that included sleet and hail. The lightning was followed immediately by head-splitting thunder with no delay. It was right on top of me. I was thankful I was between two peaks and not at a high point. Still, I got thoroughly saturated but made it to the shelter a little quicker than I had planned. I have hung my clothes to dry. I am sharing the shelter tonight with two boys who just graduated from high school, and a group of 5 women who hike together once or twice a year. 
Then to top it off a bear wondered into camp briefly and stood still long enough for a picture.

I am at Byrd's Nest #3 tenting tonight after 17.5 miles. I don't know why it is called that but I did pass a sign that said Byrd's Nest #4 earlier. 
All the clothes I was wearing yesterday during the storm was soaked. I hung them to dry inside the shelter but still I had to put on cold and wet socks and shoes. And you know what is worse than that? Cold and wet underwear! 
I stopped at Elkwallow wayside store and restaurant about 10 o'clock and had a breakfast sandwich and cinnamon roll and Mt. Dew. It sure was good!! 
I had to climb some mountains today, Hogback, Pass, and Mary's Rock. I saw two more bears today too. A Momma and cub. The cub climbed a tree and Momma ran. Neither were still long enough for a picture. 
The water for this shelter is .4 miles away and way the heck down hill. I hate that!!

I am at a very full Big Meadows campground and did 14.4 miles today. It was an exciting day! I saw some deer. I saw a bear. Both allowed pictures!! 
I stopped at Skyland Resort and had their breakfast buffet!! It was so good!
A cold front has been blowing through and the weather has been cold and windy. So hiking is good! Big Meadows was completely full. This is a big place and it is full. I went to the registration place and was referred to the campground hosts who allow hikers to set up on their site. They said yes!! I did laundry, took a shower, and went to the Lodge for a meal!! Life is good!! 
Tammy is trying to keep me from getting too exposed to the wildlife. I promise!! It just happens!! Need to do long day tomorrow.

I am at the Hightop Hut after 20.8 miles. I was on the trail by 6 this morning and it was barely light enough to see. The trail was mostly nice, smooth and flat which made the miles slip by. 
I saw another bear this morning and asked his permission for a picture. By implied consent he agreed. He posed well! That brings my bear count up to 5 so far. I also saw several deer. No snakes today. 
I also saw a small place where they are trying to reintroduce the American Chestnut tree. Supposedly with a genetic resistance to the blight that wiped them out long ago. That would be cool!!
Expecting rain to start tonight and continue through tomorrow. 
August 7
I am at Loft Mountain Campground after 15.3 miles. It has been raining since 5 AM. I wearing rain gear but still wind up soaked from either rain or sweat. It has also been very foggy, misty, and just in general a frustrating day. But as Tammy just pointed out there have been so many more positive days than bad!! Must stay focused on the good!! 
I have seen several deer today but so far no bears. I got to the campground and did my best to set up my tent keeping the inside dry. Changed into some dry clothes and then made the trek to the camp store where I can dry my hiking clothes and sit on a bench with a beer and somehow not look like a bum. 
Tomorrow will be another long day at about 20 miles. But then the next day I will be going into a Hostel in Waynesboro for a bed and meals. I am thinking about taking a slackpack one of the days I am there. 
You know, God takes care of us! While sitting here feeling frustrated a man came up and we started talking. He expressed so much support of what I was doing and wanted to follow my journal. He is a former NY city undercover cop! God bless him!! He helped me more than he knows! 
August 8 
At the Calf Mountain Shelter after 19.1 miles. The weather was great today. It rained most of the night though so most of my stuff is damp and the tent was soaked. It started out foggy and misty but soon the sun came out and the temperature stayed in the 70's. I have my tent hanging on a line to dry now. The trail had some low volume ups and downs but was very cooperative with my desired mileage. 
I am still feeling good from meeting the NY cop! My smile has been on all day! 
Tomorrow I have a short hike and will exit Shenandoah National Park. It has been nice. Today I saw no bears but did see some deer and a small non poisonous snake. I will be staying in Waynesboro tomorrow for some rest, cleanup and food.

I am in Waynesboro, VA at the Stanimal's 328 Hostel after a 7.7 mile morning. Today's hike was not difficult but a little more challenging terrain than in days past. I saw a deer and fawn early on. I also saw a yellow jacket nest before they had a chance to try a sting me, and two humans working on the trail. 
I have gone to the deli for a burger and to the grocery store for food. I also have washed me and my laundry. 
Just in case you didn't know what ""slackpacking"" was, that is where you hike but without all of the usual weight. You just take a little water, food, and some emergency stuff. Leaving behind the tent, bedding, stove, and other stuff you usually have with you. Makes for a nice day. May do that for 19 or so miles tomorrow. 
August 10
It will be another night at the Stanimal Hostel tonight after a 19.1 mile slackpack that although late in getting started turned out to be a very interesting day. ""Interesting"" is of course up for interpretation. I didn't get started till 10 AM because our host had a prior delivery to do before getting us to the trail. The other two with me were headed on south while I needed to head north back to where I left off yesterday. The trail was outstanding! Beautiful woods and although rocky in places mostly an easy going trek. 
I saw a deer, a bear, and a naked man! The deer ran away quickly. The bear posed and dug. The man talked and posed too! He said he was a Naturist and that he hiked naked all the time. He didn't mind his picture being taken either! 
At the end of the hike I came to the place where I was to meet my host to pick me up when I was greeted by three people who wanted to treat me to a ""banquet"". They were just doing a random act of kindness! They say me down and had a guy dressed formally serve me fruit, water, and twinkies! Is that a good day or what?!

I am at The Priest Shelter after 15.5 miles today. Today's hike was tough! The trail was rougher, steeper, and I had my full pack to carry over significant mountains. Three Ridges Mt. and The Priest which is the first mountain I have had over 4000 ft. since I climbed Katahdin. 
I did visit Maupin Field Shelter too. Some of you are familiar with what happened to my son. But many are not so let me tell you. Jackson (aka Southpaw Sparrow) started his thru hike in early June right after he graduated from GA Tech. He started up in Maine as a south bound hiker. By Labor Day weekend he had made his way to this area of Virginia. It was a holiday weekend so other people were on the trail and in the shelter called Maupin Field. He had finished his meal and set up his bed. It was dusk and pretty dark by that time. He took his water bottle to the little stream behind the shelter and on the way back he was bitten on his right ankle by a copperhead snake. He never saw it till after the bite. The folks in the shelter with him packed up his stuff and went far enough to get a signal to call 911. It took some doing but eventually a gator was used to get him to an ambulance and then over to Charlottesville where he was treated with antivenom. His right leg from the knee down was black and blue and very swollen. Tammy and I got up there and brought him home. He could not walk on the leg for a week or so but gradually healed back to normal. But that ended his hike that year. We got him back to that same spot the next year and he finished the trail. I am proud of his handling of what had to be a scary time for him. And I know he was so disappointed to have his hike interrupted. So, anyway, now you know why I had to visit that shelter and take a few photos. I would like to try to see if the shelter register is still available from back then to see what other people's comments were about it.

I am at Cow Camp Shelter after 16.8 miles. It was a smiling kinda day! The predicted rain didn't. Still, it was warm and humid and sweat was flowing freely. The trail kind of maintained most of the altitude that I had gained yesterday while climbing The Priest. Sort of like walking along a ridge but not open. And then I was amongst several old apple trees and also blackberry bushes! Oh, my goodness! It was an all you could eat fruit fest! The apples were not at their peak ripeness but still sweet, crisp, and juicy. I ate several and also a few handfuls of the berries. 
I have clothes hung out to dry and have collected my water. Now for some coos coos, and salmon!

I am at Punchbowl Shelter tenting tonight after 15.1 miles. From the shelter this morning I had to climb Bald Knob (not bald) and then began a long down hill from over 4000 ft. to almost 1000 ft.. Then a climb back up to 2500 ft. where the shelter is for tonight. It is HOT!!!
I have seen a turtle and some frogs. I have also found out my camera is not working. So I am now just using my iPhone for pictures. For now. I have hiked every day for over 2 weeks now. I have covered 228.3 miles since leaving Harpers Ferry. That gives me an average of 15.22 miles per day since returning to the south. I need to think about taking a zero. It it needs to be in a place where I can see what is ailing my camera and get a new one if needed.

I am at Stanimal's 328 Hostel this time in Glasgow, VA. Yes, he owns more than one. I was at his place in Waynesboro 4 days ago. I went 10.5 miles today. 
Glascow is a Very small place. There are two restaurants. Both were closed today. I shopped for my needed groceries at Dollar General. Then I went 30 yards to the other small grocery store to buy a sandwich and some chips. The manager is this place fixed me some supper and will fix me breakfast in the morning. 
I got on the trail about 6:10 this morning. Right as it was beginning to lighten up a bit. I saw a bear this morning before leaving the shelter area. He was just roaming through the camping area where I was. It was still mostly dark and kinda spooky seeing his eyes glowing in the dark with my headlamp pointing at him. That would be bear #7!

Somehow my finger touched a wrong place on my phone screen and I deleted yesterday's and today's notes before getting them posted to my journal. So, I will summarize. Yesterday I did a slackpack and stayed another night at Stanimal's. There was a little bit of drizzle early in the day but mostly it was a very nice 14.9 miles. I also met Smitty coming in the opposite direction. He had been off the trail for a family emergency but is back now. It was good to see him! At the end of the hike someone was doing trail magic and gave me a Dr. Pepper and some Fritos. I'm easy!
Today after 16.9 miles I am at Cove Mtn. Shelter. Hot dry day. Not much water along the way. And none at the shelter. I had to fill my water bottles and bags at Jenning's Creek and haul that additional 9 pounds of water weight in my pack up 1000 feet and 3.2 miles! I saw 2 deer and a black snake.

I am at the Fullhardt Knob Shelter after a 20 mile day. The first half of the day was nice and I got 9 of my miles in before 10 AM. Then the afternoon turned brutal. The temperature was 90 and most all the streams and springs were dry. I finally found some water in Wilson Creek. I loaded up my belly and my bags and bottles but I still had 7 - 8 miles to go. This shelter has a cistern to collect water from rain gutters. And there was water in it!!! So I have drank, eaten, and feeling good again. 
This morning before leaving the shelter I saw bear number 8 walking about 30 yards away. I also saw another turtle. 
Tomorrow the trail will go through Daleville where I hope to get a meal and maybe a Gatorade or a beer!! 
Oh! Also I am now 2/3 of the way through with the whole trail!!

I am at the Campbell Shelter after 20.4 miles. The last 2 nights I have the shelters to myself and it is looking that way tonight too. Fine by me! I got off to a fine start this morning! I was sitting in the early morning darkness drinking some cold coffee with my legs hanging off the floor platform when all of a sudden a mouse decided he wanted to use my leg as his way to get into the shelter! I jumped and spilled my coffee. Our old friend the s-word just slipped out so naturally. Also, this morning I got stung by a yellow jacket on my arm. I never saw a nest. Just random I guess. 
I didn't stop in Daleville this morning. I probably should have. The temperature was a little lower and more comfortable but still water is not plentiful. There was water at a shelter I passed and also at the one I am at now.

I am in the Hampton Inn in Roanoke after 4.4 miles. I got on the trail about 6:20 or so and quickly climbed close to 1000 feet to get to McAfee's Knob. The most photographed spot on the AT. A girl there started asking me questions about my pack and as I was talking to her the sun broke the horizon. I said ""Oops, I have to get that."" And took a couple of pictures and got her to take some of me. It was a great moment. I think you will like the pictures. I got to the road intersection and got an Uber ride into town getting to the Hampton in time for breakfast!! I have spent the day getting some groceries and getting a new camera. Planning on a zero tomorrow. Still a couple more things I need including rest.

It will be another day at the Hampton Inn. Zero miles. Now when I say ""0"" miles, that means trail miles. I had to do a lot of walking yesterday. To get from the hotel to Walmart, Best Buy, back to Walmart, back to the hotel while carrying several bags involved a lot of exertion. But I did have good meals at Longhorn and also a Chinese buffet. I spent some time cleaning stuff, and repackaging groceries, and familiarizing myself with my new camera. It is a Fugifilm camera less expensive that my broken one but with many of the same features. And it has a better interface with my phone. Now I have to get by the post office tomorrow morning to send the old one back home. 
Today I need to go by a outdoor supply place to replace my deteriorating shirt, get some fuel, and see if I want to replace my shoes. The ones I am using now have close to 1000 miles on them. Tomorrow will be back on trail and experiencing the eclipse!

Right now I am a part of a group of 7 Flip Floppers! Some knew others but no one knew all. We all had lunch together at a convenience store and then went as fast as we could to try to get to Dragon's Tooth as a good high place from which to see the eclipse. I got there with like 1 or 2 minutes to spare. Other people were there and shared the special glasses. It was great! This group may separate due to different paces but for now there are me, Smitty, Hot Tub, Chainsaw, Luna, Mona Lisa, and Spice.

Ok. Today was a lesson in flexibility! It was another hot day with little available water along the way. The plan was to go Sarver Hollow Shelter at about 16.1 miles. There were some strenuous climbs and rocky ridge walks. Then the shelter was .4 miles down a steep rocky trail down hill from the AT. I was first there and quickly started to go the water which was supposed to be a spring. There was no water to be found! By the I was joined by Smitty and Luna. So we went back up hill to the trail to keep the others from coming down there and to decide what to do. In the guide was mentioned a campsite with water 3.1 miles away and down hill. But what if it didn't have water? Then we wouldn't have water or a cell phone signal. So we called a hostel we had seen advertised and they agreed to pick us up at a highway in 2 1/2 hours and it was 4 miles for us. So off we went. Made our appointment and headed to Four Pines Hostel. Got some food, water, showers, laundry, and a bed!! 
Dehydration is more likely to cause problems for you than a bear. Don't underestimate your water needs!! 
August 23
Bailey Gap Shelter after 17.1 miles. I got a late start since we had to be shuttled from the hostel for 30 miles, after breakfast and after laundry. I had two strong climbs and was carrying more water weight than usual. But I also found water that was a real Godsend up on top of the ridge which you would have thought would be dry. So plenty of water tonight!! But no signal. 
August 24
Rice Field Shelter after 16.5 miles. Got started about 7:30 and had good water before climbing. Still carrying more water than usual. Today's shelter has a wonderful view and I am looking forward to the sunset. 
I saw bear number 9 today. I was walking through an old orchard and the bear was standing under an apple tree with his back to me. I was about 30 yards away and made a kissing noise and he took off. He was a juvenile and less than 100 pounds.

I am at the Holiday Motor Lodge in Pearisburg, VA. Yesterday I walked 6.9 miles to get into town. Once I got into town I was offered a ride by a lady who saw me walking and she brought me the last couple of miles to the motel. I have gotten pretty good at getting things done that need doing once I get into town. I had showered, done laundry, and bought groceries within an hour and a half. I spent the afternoon getting stuff out of my pack for a planned slackpack, back washed my water filter, ate at a Mexican place, took a nap, and watched Tarzan. I met Smitty and Chainsaw at the Chinese restaurant for dinner. 
Today at 6 AM, Smitty, Chainsaw, Mona Lisa, and I were being shuttled out to the trail for a long slackpack, 26.3 miles. The temperature was in the 50's this morning and the trail was pretty easy. We crossed paths with Hot tub, Luna, and Spice going the other way with full packs. It was a really good hike today. We ate at the Mexican place again tonight.

I am at Lick Skillet Hostel after 25.2 miles. I really didn't plan on that many miles. But I did want to stay with my buds and they were going to go 18 miles and stay at a hostel. Well, turned out that one was closed for renovation. So some quick phone calls were made and a new plan came out that involved more miles but a place to stay, a bed, food, and a ride to a trailhead that will allow another 25 mile slackpack tomorrow and another night here. The slackpack part of this is what makes it possible for me. To be relieved of most of my pack weight is enormous in what my legs and feet can stand. 
Chainsaw has to get off the trail for a little while for family reasons but should rejoin us in a week or so. Hot tub, Luna, and Spice are with full packs about 9 miles back. 
More good news! Jack will be coming up to join me hiking for 3 days this coming Labor Day weekend!! We will end up in Damascus on Monday and then he will head back to Atlanta on Tuesday. I am so glad to get to spend that time with him!!

Again at Lick Skillet Hostel after a 26.7 mile slackpack. Man, I am tired! My feet hurt. Smitty, Mona Lisa, and I have done 78.2 miles in the last 3 days. Ok, so no more long days for a while. Today, the trail had some very beautiful open forest areas and also some grassy pastures to walk through. Very nice. Still long though. 
Mongol, the owner of the hostel, fixed us a delicious supper of beans and Boston Butt! He is also washing our clothes and will shuttle us back to the trail tomorrow as we move on south.

I have been looking ahead to try and have a plan of some sort for the next couple of weeks. I don't want to lose the companionship of the crew of 7 that I posted a picture of a few days ago. But I am so looking forward to my time with Jack!!!!! So once Jack and I part on Tuesday morning of next week I will be attempting to catch up to my buds. Weather will be an issue. The rain, though very needed, will affect my distance, where I camp, and how I camp. Plus add to that the individual plans of each of the group of buddies and you can see how difficult it is to maintain contact and intersect with them. 
I have just recently found the wonderful world of podcasts. Many of you will already know about this but for me they are new and wonderful. First, for some reason the birds of the south are not as vocal as the ones up north. At least not where I have been. So in the afternoons I have been listening to a variety of podcasts. These are kind of like TV shows but only audio. Like the old timey radio shows. I can put in my ear buds and select a podcast and the for an hour or so,
while I am walking, I can listen to a story, or a educational piece, or a philosophy, or even study a language (Italian) while I walk. It helps take my mind off fatigue and shortens the day a bit. I love it! 
Just got through eating at The Wooden Pickle in downtown Marion. Very good! Now ready for a nap. 
If I have been boring lately with too much focus on mileage and logistics, I apologize. I have been away from home for 4 1/2 months now. Like every other project, this one must also have an end. I do want to finish. But at the right time and I want to finish well! I want to get back to those who love me but also to see and smell the roses along the way. Be patient with me! I will get there! 
September 1
I am at the approximately named Hurricane Shelter after 19.2 miles today. I say that because much of the weather today has been affected by the remnants of Hurricane Harvey which has wondered away from Texas and is in mid-America somewhere. It has been windy, raining some, and foggy today. Now that I am in the shelter it is getting colder. 
I started hiking today with Hot tub, but he went on another 4 miles or so to the next shelter. Smitty is a day ahead. Mona Lisa is 2 days ahead. Luna and Spice are one shelter back. 
Tomorrow I will get on the trail by 7 and should get to where I am to meet Jack by 8 to 8:30. It may be raining some more but I am looking forward to seeing him and we will climb Virginia's highest mountain and go through Grayson Highlands together.

We are at Thomas Knob Shelter after 16.1 miles. Jack arrived on time at the designated spot via shuttle. So good to see him!! It was a very windy, drizzling, foggy day. We climbed Mt. Rogers and entered Grayson Highlands. There were few ponies but the ones we did see were beautiful and one was a very friendly greeter! 
The shelter was a large one with an upper loft. It is supposed to sleep 16 people. When we got there, there were over 20 people on the lower level plus 4 dogs. And the upper part had one girl who said there would be 7 sleeping up there plus 1 dog. Problem was, almost none of those there intended to stay the night. They were just waiting out the rain. But they were occupying space so that no one who wanted to stay could set up in. Finally it all settled out. Jack set up his tent and I slept in the loft. There were a very nice group of 4 men who really appreciated my thru hiker status. 
September 3 
Saunders Shelter after 18.8 miles. 
We were on the trail by a little after 7 this morning and in much better weather. It was cool at first and then warmed a little. But the sun showed and felt good. We had some climbs today but overall it was mostly downhill from Mt. Rogers. Here at the shelter we have a bear hanging out. Number 10 for me. From what people have written in the shelter register he is a regular and they have named him Brian. He doesn't look threatening but he doesn't scare easily and keeps coming back. I have hung our food bags high. Tomorrow Damascus is about 9 miles away! 
September 4
Jack and I are in Damascus at The Montgomery Homestead Inn after 9.3 miles. The trail goes right through the town. Our hostess is very nice and has met our needs. Tomorrow Jack will take me to the trailhead and I will do a 21 or so mile slackpack back to Damascus. He will then return to Atlanta. The next day, Wednesday, I will use a shuttle to take me to the same spot and proceed on south.

I did a slackpack today of 21.7 miles back into Damascus from TN Hwy 91. Jack took me to the trail head. It was hard to watch him leave. I have so enjoyed his presence with me the last 3 days. Today's hike was pretty easy. I finished the 21.7 miles in 7 hours and 15 minutes. But I have accomplished 2 things! One, I am under 500 miles till I finish. 447.3 to be exact. Also, I have completed Virginia!!! That took a long time! One quarter of the trail is in Virginia and sometimes it seems as though you will never get through it. It was a pleasure. But I am now moving on into Tennessee!! 11 states down and 3 to go! 
September 6
I am at the Boots Off Hostel after 20.6 miles. I had intended to do 18 miles and stay in a shelter. But I learned at the beginning of my hike today that the shelter was closed due to ""aggressive bear activity."" So I called the historic make sure they had room and adjusted my plan. And, guess what!! Most all of my fellow Flip Flop hiker buddies are here! Smitty, Hot tub, Mona Lisa, and Chainsaw. 2 of them did a slackpack back to here so technically they are still 20 miles ahead of me. But for tonight we are reunited! 
Today started off raining and cold but eventually the sun burned through and it was a nice afternoon. I miss Jack!

I am at the Black Bear Resort and Hostel after 8.5 miles. A short day for me to be sure. Made shorter by yesterday's extra miles caused by the closing of the shelter I planned on. All things work out. This is a family owned enterprise and has a very personal touch. Today I got to see Laurel Falls, which were very beautiful and might have been tempted to go for a swim if it had not been unseasonably cold at 50 degrees. I am in the bunk room by myself and tomorrow I will be shuttled to a place 25 trail miles from here and will slackpack back to here. I have no signal here but I am aware of Hurricane Irma and watching it as best I can. It may impact my journey! 
September 8
Another night at The Black Bear Resort and Hostel after a 25.1 mile slackpack. I now have less than 400 miles to go!! Today's hike was a good one. I covered the miles in 9 hours! But I really had to move to get er done! But the terrain was accommodating and the weather was good. It started out at 43 degrees this morning. I met Smitty and Hot tub on the trail going the opposite direction. I talked them into another slackpack tomorrow of 22 miles and a stay at Mountain Harbor Hostel. That will put us closer to Erwin, TN and safety in case Hurricane Irma comes our way. I saw some deer today. A doe and three fawns with their spots still on. I have washed me and my clothes tonight. My legs are ready to rest!
September 9
Today I am at Mountain Harbor Hostel near Elk Park, NC. I slackpacked 21.4 miles today. I really did some mountains today! Roan Mountain was the biggest at 6212 feet. But after that was Round Bald, Jane Bald, Little Hump Mt. , and then Hump Mt.. It was nice not carrying all my stuff over all those mountains. The guy taking me to the trail from the last hostel dropped off my stuff at tonight's hostel. I just had to hike! The shelter I have a picture of is the highest shelter on the whole AT. It was a gorgeous and cool day with many great views of surrounding mountains and the area. I passed by Smitty and Hot tub going the opposite direction along the way. We will all be going the same way tomorrow. We will be in Erwin, TN on Monday afternoon and if needed will ride out the storm there. I hate to lose a day this close to home but will be careful. I saw a doe with 3 fawns today and got some pictures of a couple of them.

I am tenting tonight at a campsite just south of the peak of Unaka Mt. after 16 miles. My stay at Mountain Harbor was very comfortable and I had a wonderful gormet and large breakfast. I was then shuttled to the trail and got started hiking about 9:30. It was a beautiful and cool day in the forest. Smitty caught up to me at a shelter we considered but we were thinking that with the rain coming tomorrow afternoon, we would like to go a few more miles to get over the mountain and closer to Erwin to make tomorrow's hike a little shorter. So went another 4 miles to this campsite. Hot tub came in about 45 minutes later. So tomorrow we have about 13-14 miles to go to get to Uncle Johnnies Hostel where Mona Lisa and Chainsaw are. I think the 5 of us will be sharing a cabin. Tuesday is supposed to be when the weather is bad. We'll see!! 
September 11
I am at Uncle Johnnie's Hostel in Erwin,TN after 13.6 miles. It was cold and windy last night. I had my clothes on, my jacket, a sleeping bag liner, all inside my sleeping bag. I was on the trail by 7:15 and trying to beat the predicted rain. I made it to the hostel just as it was beginning to drizzle at 12:20. Just in time to for the 12:30 shuttle to lunch at a pizza buffet place. Smitty and Hot tub got here a little later. Hot tub chose to get his own little cabin but the rest of us are sharing one. We have wifi but not much of a phone signal. I am trying to keep up with friends and loved ones and how they weathered the storm. Prayers and thoughts for you all!!! No hiking today. Rest and food. I am planning to do a 24+ mile slackpack tomorrow.","

Still at Uncle Johnnie's Hostel in Erwin TN. Today Smitty, Hot tub, and I did a 24.5 mile slackpack and Mona Lisa and Chainsaw went on south toward Hot Springs. It is still windy up here in the mountains and today's walk was the first since the storm. Not too bad but there was a fair amount of debris, limbs, and trees across the trail. Some were harder than others to get over or around. Today's trail in part was what I hiked with Jack when I joined him for a few days on the second leg of his thru hike in 2012. Those are really good memories! 
Luna and Spice have caught up to where we are but still one day behind. The three amigos will be moving on south tomorrow! 
September 14
I am at the Jerry Cabin Shelter after 17.5 miles. Today again for part of the time was on trail that Jack and I did together back in 2012. Then I went further. I know I must have been a drag on Jack at that time. I am different now. We got a later start today than we had hoped. It was drizzling for some of the way. And then it rained the last 2 miles. At that time we walked across a Bald and the wet grass got our shoes and socks soaked. But!! We are now at the 300 mile mark!! And 1 1/2 days from Hot Springs! 
September 15
Hot tub and I are tenting in a campsite on Rich Mountain after 18.1 miles today. Smitty kept on going and is now in Hot Springs. We did a good bit of climbing today and it was a warm clear day. It is 8.3 miles into Hot Springs from here and we plan to try to get there tomorrow in time for breakfast somewhere. Mona Lisa has let us know that shuttle prices are high there and she is not so impressed with the hostel. We'll see how that plays out. May not be doing a slackpack on Sunday after all.

I am at Laughing Heart Hostel in Hot Springs, NC after 8.3 miles. The trail has been sort of wandering between NC and TN and that will continue at least through Great Smokey Mt. National Park. Today's hike was mostly downhill with a few mild climbs. I really did not have a very good view of the French Broad River as Hot tub and I descended into town. We went straight to the diner for breakfast. Then we got checked into the hostel. I showered and then went to a store for grocery resupply. I will be doing a slackpack tomorrow and then on Monday will head on south. I will be trying to get to and through GSMNP in 4 - 5 days. So I needed enough food to last me all the way to Fontana Village where I will spend one night in the lodge and resupply again. 
I have an ending date in mind and it is to walk into Amicalola State Park on October 4. Much can happen between now and then. But that is my plan! 
September 17
Still at Laughing Heart Hostel after a 20.5 mile slackpack. Everything went perfect today! I had preordered a breakfast from the diner which opened at 6:30. It was ready on time and delicious! I dropped off a birthday card for Mom at the post office. I then sat down in front of the outfitters store to eat my breakfast while waiting on my 7:00 AM shuttle. He was there on time and I was on the trail for a slackpack by 7:40. My trek today was mostly downhill. On top of Max Patch there were 25 - 30 tents of people just camping and seeing the sunrise. I got to see Mona Lisa, Chainsaw, Smitty, Luna, and Spice all going the opposite direction (uphill). I got back to Hot Springs about 3:45. I got cleaned up quickly and went down town to a delicious steak at Iron Horse Station. Now I am packing up all my stuff for tomorrow's shuttle back to Max Patch but I will be south bound!!

I am at Davenport Gap Shelter after 16.2 miles. My shuttle was once again right on time and got me to the trail by 7:40 this morning. The trail went up and down a few mountains under a warm blue sky. It was well into the 80's today and the canopy of the trees felt good and cool. 
I have entered the Great Smokey Mountain National Park. Thru hikers have to pay for a backwoods permit. Unlike the rest of the AT thru hikers do not have first privilege in the shelters in GSMNP. If a shelter is full and a section hiker or a weekend hiker comes up at 9:30 at night and wants to stay in the shelter, the thru hiker has to give up his space and tent nearby. This first shelter has a chain link fence over the opening to keep out bears. Kind of a reverse zoo! 
September 19
I am tenting tonight at Peck's Corner Shelter after 19.7 miles. The shelter is a little over half full so Smitty and I decided to tent in a quieter place. Today was a hard  day. 19.7 miles but also a LOT of climbing. We went from 2591 feet to over 6300 feet. And it was not a straight line either. It was up and down and then up higher. Currently I am at 5556 feet above sea level. Tomorrow I will maintain most of this altitude as I roller coaster along a ridge walk that will take me over Clingman's Dome which is the highest point on the whole AT at 6667 feet. My mileage tomorrow will be over 20 miles but it should be an easier day. Smitty is meeting his parents at Newfound Gap tomorrow and he will spend the night with them in Gatlinburg.

I am at Double Spring Gap Shelter after 20.6 miles. I guess the day was slightly easier than yesterday. But still there was lots of climbing. I mean it was Clingman's Done! But the iconic tower at the top is closed for repairs. So no views! A hiker I met up in Maine and was sick at the time, was in the parking lot at Newfound Gap today! And he was doing trail magic! He gave me a Subway sandwich, a beer, and a honey bun! Fantastic! Looks like another almost 20 miles tomorrow. Better go to bed! 
September 21
I am at Mollie's Ridge Shelter after 19.4 miles. The Smokies are wearing me out. The first several miles were constant ups and downs. And not too many views. There are a few leaf color changes going on but not much yet. The last 5 miles of the day were flat and easy. Tonight the shelter is crowded with 10 people. Pretty nice folks so far. Tomorrow I will have about 10 miles to get to Fontana Dam and that will be mostly downhill. Also, I am now under 200 miles! 177.3 miles to go!! 
September 22
I am at the Fontana Lodge for the night after 11 miles today. The trail crosses the long Fontana Dam. I went to the info desk at the dam to see if the lodge would send someone to pick me up since it was a 4 mile walk to the lodge. They said yes, but an hour later there was still no ride. I asked the volunteers at the information desk to please recall them and I talked to a lady and told her it would be very hard for me to spend my money if I was stuck at the dam all day. She said, ""yes sir"" and 10 minutes later a maintenance pick up truck was there to take me to the lodge. I had to ride in the back which was ok with me. Any way I have gotten showered, laundry done, groceries bought, and one meal in me. So I am happy for now. 
I have officially finished with GSMNP and I have also left behind the state of TN. Just two more states to go!! I am  still on schedule to finish on October 4 and next weekend I will be able to take a couple of days off to spend the weekend with Tammy in Asheville to celebrate our 37th anniversary. Looking forward to that and a great finish!

I am at Locust Cove Gap campsite after 18.6 miles. I enjoyed my short stay at the Fontana Lodge. I was relaxed and enjoyed good food after all my chores were done. I got shuttled out and on the trail by 8:30 this morning. I had planned to go to a shelter a little ways back but I got there by 2:30. Too early to quit. Also I had planned to spend tomorrow night at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) hostel. But they had no rooms of any kind available when I called. So, I decided to go about 5.5 miles further today so that I can get to the NOC (10 miles from here) earlier tomorrow. I will have a meal at the restaurant and buy 2 - 3 days of groceries and get on out to a shelter further south. It is thundering and sprinkling on my tent tonight. Shoot!
September 24 (Mom's Birthday) 
I am at Wesser Bald Shelter after16.3 miles. I am glad I went the extra miles yesterday. I had a little over 10 miles to get down to the NOC and was there by noon or so. I went straight to the restaurant and had a good burger, fries, beer and the server brought me my check. I said, ""Wait, I am not done yet!"" I then ordered a brownie supreme which I saw a table of 4 sharing. I, however, ate mine all by myself! I bought a few groceries and was back on the trail by 1:45. It was about 6 miles, uphill all the way, to get to this shelter. There was a pretty devastating fire recently which has the forest blackened and scarred.

There are 5 of us ""old"" men here in the shelter tonight. And I am the youngest. Two of the guys have been telling me about how bad the blown down trees are on the trail in north GA. I guess I will find out for myself in a couple of days. I'll be there! Tomorrow I will be aiming for 20 miles and will be going under 100 miles left to go!

I am at Carter Gap Shelter after 20.1 miles. Today was mostly gentle rolling hills with the exception of a short steep climb up Albert Mountain, where I had my lunch. There were no significant blown down trees to block my way today. 
The men I was with last night ranged from late 60's to 75 years old. I got a text from Mona Lisa that two of these men had seemed very rude when talking to her, Chainsaw, and French Dip because they thought it was ridiculous that the younger more experienced hikers were trying to do 20 mile days in the face of so many blown down trees blocking the trail. They seemed alright to me. But then, I'm old too.

Today I climbed Standing Indian Mtn pretty easily and didn't have to hurry since I only had to go 12.5 miles. I was at this shelter by 2:00. Tomorrow I have only 11.8 miles to go to get to where fabulous Vicky will pick me up and allow me to stay with her and Randal tomorrow night, Sunday night, and Monday night. She will be helping me slackpack on Monday and then on Tuesday will be dropping me off to move on south and what will be my last night on the trail. 
When I arrived at this shelter I noticed that the shelter register was all shredded in a big mess. I suspected a mouse did it. Sure enough, I opened the wall box where the register is usually kept and there is a squirming mouse nest in there! I am sleeping on the other side of the shelter!
September 28
Vicky's and Randal's house in Hiawassee. These two wonderful people and life long friends were at the parking area when I exited the woods! The hike today was a good one so far as weather goes but was made more ""interesting"" by all the downed trees laying across the trail. The Georgia Appalachian Trail folks have really been on the ball and have clearing up all the mess. In NC though there were still multiple very large trees broken or pushed over all along and over the trail. But I either went through or around them and made pretty good time. Now, Georgia is not only on my mind, it is under my feet! 
I have been lovingly and thoroughly taken care of today and will spend the weekend with Tammy.

Tammy and I had a wonderful weekend in Asheville at the Grove Park Inn. An indulgence for sure. But we loved every moment. The spa was first class and we were expertly taken care of and came back to our room feeling like a cooked noodle. Then we had a wonderful meal on the Sunset Terrace. Tammy then brought me back to Vicky and Randal on Sunday. 
I can not say enough good things about these two! They have made me so comfortable and fed me and taken care of every need. And they have taken on the task of getting me to and from the trail when needed. Tomorrow they will get me to Woody Gap where I will begin the last two days of my trek. I have heard from Smitty and I will meet him and Hot Tub at Stover Creek Shelter for our last night on the trail. The next day we will finish together down at Amicalola Falls State Park. I will try to post again about the final two days and then after I have gathered my thoughts I will do a kind of epilogue to bring my journal to a conclusion. Thank you all for sticking with me!

I am at Stover Creek Shelter after 18 miles today. This the last night on the trail!! I am here with Smitty, Hot Tub, and Al. Al is finishing the southern half of the AT after doing the northern part several years ago. Another day of fantastic weather and pretty easy trail. We are all in good light hearted moods reflecting on our good times and experiences of the last 5 1/2 months. None of us really anxious for it to end but still it feels so good to see something this big come to a good conclusion. 
Tomorrow we will have 2.8 miles to get to Springer Mtn. And then it will be 8.8 miles to get down to Amicalola Falls. I don’t have a signal tonight so I can’t let Tammy know my ETA. Oh, well. Will hope for a signal on top of Springer. 
October 4
Smitty, Hot Tub, and I were on the trail by 6:45 in the dark using our head lamps to climb to the top of Springer Mtn. We were there by 8. It was a glorious moment! We just didn’t really know how to feel. Yes, glad to have reached a goal sought for over the last 5 1/2 months. But also a sense of disbelief that such an epic adventure was coming to an end. We soaked up the moment with some pictures and congratulations and then we headed on down the mountain to Amicalola Falls. It was a fast paced hike to the State Park and we arrived together at the archway that begins and ends the approach trail. We touched our poles to the top of the arch and we were done. Tammy and Jack were there to welcome me and see the finale. There were introductions and hugs all around. Soon, Smitty’s parents were there and more hugging and excitement. We all talked a little but then had to make our way back to separate lives, families, and memories. 
Tammy, Jack, and I had lunch at the lodge in the park. Jack headed back to Atlanta and Tammy and I headed home. A home I have not seen in so long. A home that is comfortable and that needs me. A loving and enduring wife. And the precious memories of a wilderness that knows my name.

Foghat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579338,"One can not do an adventure such as this without the prayers, support and encouragement of many people. So, I must thank each of you for reading my journal and for all the wonderful and much needed words that made me smile, and made me stronger, and helped me take yet another step. Most of all this applies to my dear wife, Tammy. Without her none of this would have even been possible. Others who gave so much of themselves and their time were Vicky and Randal, Beth and Dan, Dr. Church, and Robert Urtis. People in our church were not only supportive of me but also of Tammy when she needed it most.
There were many folks I met on the trail whom will forever be in my memory as fellow sufferers, and fellow conquerors. Smitty, Hot Tub, Mona Lisa, Chainsaw, Luna, and Spice are the ones had the most time with. 
I have been told by several people that this journal has allowed them to live this adventure through me. That it has been inspirational. I am very glad for that! But I hope that even more than that, it will have been at least a little motivational too. I hope that it will spur interest in people to get out of their comfort zones and seek their own adventures. Age is just a number. Get out there into the great outdoors and truly live! If you fall, get up and do it again. Don't just wait out your years in an easy chair watching someone else live life for you. Embrace a little risk and uncertainty. And laugh along the way. Life is too precious not to live it!
