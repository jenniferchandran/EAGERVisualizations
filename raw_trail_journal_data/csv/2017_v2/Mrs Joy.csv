Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553124,"I just gave (lots of) notice at my job and registered my start date with the ATC. It just got real.I'm at a bit of a crossroads and it's a good time to hike. I'm seven years older than I was at my last thru, and quite a bit more beat up. I'm not at all certain my bones are up to the task. But I have noticed that you can fail either by trying and failing, or by not trying at all. Not trying at all sounds boring.Plus, as I was thinking ""I think I'm going to do this"" a gorgeous pale hawk flew by. Hawks are my signs. It was just a little hawk, and it was flying pretty low. Kind of like me.",,Holy crap,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553125,"I attempted a thruhike in 2010. I got waylaid by Lyme disease. It wasn't the first time, either. I can't take doxycycline and go out into the sunlight. I burst into flame. So I had to take a month off from my hike in 2010, and when I got back out there I still felt rough. I didn't get anywhere near finishing. I hiked about 1300 miles and then I had to go back to work. I've since hiked all but about 90 of the remaining miles. Except for trail relocations, this won't be new territory for me. But I think that makes it kind of nice. I have a certain comfort level now.   I know which towns I want to stop at, which shelters or campsites are amazing. This won't be a victory tour (it'll be really hard) but it kind of feels like it to me.I guess the parts I've already done 5+ times might not be that exciting, but all the parts over about 400 miles from home I've done at most twice so I don't know them that well. And no matter how you look at it, it's still 6+ months of living in a tent and eating beef jerky. It sounds so attractive when I put it like that, doesn't it?",,About this time,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553126,"I'm not the right person to tell you how to hike the Appalachian Trail. I'm a middle aged woman of no great athletic prowess. I insist on sleeping comfortably. I'm really slow. I don't smoke up. I have increasingly bizarre health problems. I just don't, generally, fit into categories well.The thing is: if you really want it, you will find a way to do it.",,So you want to hike the Appalachian Trail,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553207,"It is a sad prepper who can't find anything lighter than what she already has. The older I get, the worse my back gets, and the more I try to find gear that will lighten my load. I keep checking things and finding that nope, that's already as light as I can find on the market. Actually my back is technically a little better now than it was five years ago, but all my OTHER parts are doing worse. Same diff. I'm stuck home today while a handyman does stuff, so I'm doing some work but I'm also doing some packing. I tried my vacuum sealer last week and it was D E D dead. So I ordered a new one, and it requires a little finagling. I'm vacuum packing my supplements. Last time I made up something like 180 daily packets. I figure this time I'll just send a month's worth of each in a baggy, and 30 packets per month. It'll be my town chore.I need to find yard sale tags, or something, to label the gear I might want sent to me. Sometimes it's hard, over the phone or by email, to be clear about exactly what you want and where it is. Labels might help. You never know.",,Ultralight Angst,"Jan 12, Thu",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553262,"I'm not leaving for over three months. I have way too much time to think about gear.I have options for nearly all categories. I can't carry everything, so I have to decide. Some things are better suited to different weather or terrain. Since my husband is a kind man, he will send me gear to swap out, so I can (for instance) use a sturdier tent in the cold, and a flimsier one in the warm. Or a freestanding tent for areas with tent platforms, and a lighter, not freestanding tent elsewhere.Starting with tents, here are my two most likely options: 1) Tarptent Rainbow. I thruhiked with this in 2010, and pretty much loved it. I didn't love that under seriously intense rain, there would be ""misting"" as small droplets forced themselves through the theoretically waterproof fabric. Henry Shires now sells a liner you can clip against the ceiling of the tent. It doesn't prevent misting, but it does prevent the misting from getting to the tent's inhabitant. I've been using the liner a couple of years. It works, but at 4 oz it's ""heavy"" (compared to some things.) It's a fairly huge space for one person, and it felt like home to me. Bonus: It can be set up freestanding by using your hiking poles across the ends.Specs: 40""x88"" floor space. 43"" height. 36 oz without modification. Plus 4 oz for the liner. Minus 2 oz, IIRC, if you get the carbon fiber arch pole rather than the aluminum one. So about 38 oz.2) Zpacks Altaplex. I purchased this recently. I've been using a Zpacks Hexamid Solo Plus since my thruhike, except in winter (mostly). It's a great tent, very weatherproof, but the Cuben fiber material is fairly see through. On a hike with my bestie, or solo, I don't care. On a multiple month hike where it's my home? I care very much. Sometimes I need privacy. Maybe I need to do something that will uncover a personal area. Maybe I need to not be seen by a creep. Maybe I just freaking want to be alone. So I bought the Altaplex, which is available in camouflage fabric that is definitely not see through. I like that it's tall enough for me to step inside without bending my knees. I like that it's light. I like less that the camouflage pattern means it's darker inside. And I miss the ability to set up freestanding. Also, it's *so* tall that I can't reach the peak inside while sitting. I need to attach some string to the loop at the top so it can be useful for hanging things inside the tent.Specs: 36""x90"" floor space. 58"" height. Weight ~18 oz. The listed weight does not include stakes , and I think the Tarptent does. But still, a 20 oz difference!? Oh, and I need a pole extender at a bit less than an ounce because I assure you that my poles do not extend to 58"" long. So let's say 19 oz. For that I might be willing to fiddle with some tent platform setups.The weight difference is enough to let me carry a 20 oz soda out of town. It may not seem like much to you, but the impact of that soda on my day is huge to me.",,"What I'm taking, Part One","Jan 14, Sat",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553263,"Things to put in the tent. I've been sleeping on a NeoAir pad for seven years. Not the same one. I am a restless sleeper. I *can* sleep on a 20"" wide pad, but I keep having to wake up and readjust things to support the knee that has inevitably slipped off the side. On a 25"" wide pad, I sleep much better. I therefore purchased a 25"" wide NeoAir. However, I'm not 7' tall, and I don't need a lumberman's pad. So I cut about a foot off the end of my NeoAir. Now it's much more my size. I've done this for both the Xlite NeoAir and the Xtherm NeoAir. The Xtherm is handy when it's cold out. The Xlite is slightly lighter. In midsummer it's handy to have a less insulating sleeping pad.Xlite: 14.9 ozXtherm: 16.5 ozI also carry a Gossamer Gear Thinlight 1/8"" foam pad. It's made of Evazote. It is far too thin for me to sleep directly on the ground, but it makes a great addition. I use it as a sit pad, as extra insulation for my inflatable sleeping pad, and (most importantly) as a wedge under the downhill side of my sleeping pad at the inevitable sloping campsite. Sliding downhill all night is NOT RESTFUL. A wedge can make a huge difference. The Thinlight pad is a little grippy, so it's perfect in this role.Thinlight: ~2.5 oz (mine is pretty beat up by now, so it may weigh less)Sleeping bag: See above re: restless sleeping. I like to use a quilt so that I have more freedom of movement. In cold weather, air creeps in around the edges. So for cold weather I have an extra wide quilt with a tiny zipper so it can be used as a bag. For warmer weather, I have a wide quilt with no zipper.The problem with the quilts, though, is they won't keep things out. Like mice. Or skunks.   Or spiders. Or anything else that wants to cozy up to me. On thruhike #1, I spent far too many nights sweltering in my bag with a mesh net over my face, because the mosquitoes were terrible. Sometimes there was no place to set up a tent, and sometimes there was but I was too tired or it was raining and I didn't have the moral fiber to deal with a wet tent.I've thought about carrying a mosquito netting to hang from the shelter roof, but so far the weight has always been too much. I'm hoping for more moral fortitude, which is extremely lightweight.Anyway, here are the specs on the two bags I use:Zpacks 20 degree quilt: ""broad width"" 66"" girth, ~ 22 ozZpacks 40 degree quilt: ""standard width"" 61"" girth, ~12.5 ozSpeaking of sleeping bags, I have an old Nunatak quilt that isn't very warm anymore. I used it to fill space and add a little weight in my training pack one year. Right before my trip, I took out the training weight and put in what I was actually taking on the trip. The first night of the trip, at the beginning of the Hundred Mile Wilderness, I unpacked my gear and found that dang Nunatak quilt snuggled away inside the pack. I ended up carrying two bags 100 miles. Oh, I was steaming when I found it. It made a nice pillow, though.Oh, also? I use a trash bag to inflate my sleeping pad. I got the Therm-A-Rest AirTap Pump Kit . It's just a tube that attaches to a trash bag. The tube will seal over the valve of the sleeping pad. I got it to avoid filling my winter pad with my nasty, humid breath. But it made my life so much nicer that I carry it full time now.Thermarest Air Tap Kit - 1 oz",,"What I'm taking, Part Two","Jan 14, Sat",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553420,"My uncle Roger was an adventurous, outdoorsy guy. We saw eye to eye on hiking. When he came to town we would talk trail. One year we even went hiking together. I remember when I was a little kid, he showed me how good it is to eat a warm tomato right off the vine. ""Grab a salt shaker"" he said. I was mystified. Maybe we were going to salt slugs? And then he pulled a tomato off a plant in the garden and handed it to me to take a bite out of like an apple, then put a little salt on before the next bite. Man that was good.Little me would be about to wander off into the woods at my grandparent's farm, and Roger would just happen to be taking a walk too. Undoubtedly to keep a niece from getting lost, but to me it felt like we were two independently woodsy folks out for a hike. As indeed we were, 30 years later.When my uncle died a few years ago, it fell to my mother to handle his estate. I went up to his house and stayed there with her for a few days, sorting things out. Among Roger's belongings was an unopened package of bandanas. I didn't want much of his things, but I took the bandanas. I'll take some on the trail with me this year. I think he'd like that.",,Taking some mementos,"Jan 17, Tue",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553422,"My first trail journal was written in a tiny notebook, per my Mom's request. The notes are brief but they still bring back the memories. Trying to sight blazes going across the Beauty Spot in a whiteout. Walking through the cathedral of a forest on top of Unaka Mountain. Getting hypothermia walking down the north side of Unaka (it was a wet few days) and being lent a warm, dry top by a kind hiker who had just left Erwin with clean laundry. Of all my hikes, that one might have changed me the most. I had been hiking a long time, but a long distance hike was a whole new ball game.",,Get in the Wayback Machine,"Jan 17, Tue",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553643,"I'm leaving in April. That seems impossibly far away this weekend. I'm home, faux sick, having a pretty standard reaction to a tetanus booster. Actual tetanus is awful and/or fatal, so I don't mind. Sort of. But I'm all achy and feverish and stuff and generally feeling puny. And thinking about gear to distract myself.You would think that by this point in my hiking career I would have my gear dialed in, but I still can't make up my mind. Jetboil? Pasta pot and alcohol stove? Halulite Minimalist and Snowpeak canister stove? Yeah, I don't know. I might have too many options. I love the convenience of the canister stoves, but I love the weight of the alcohol stoves. On my last thru I sent the stove home entirely for a while. But since then I've become accustomed to the luxury of a morning coffee as I ruminate on life in my sleeping bag. The coffee is far easier to accomplish with a canister stove. No fuss.I have my doubts about the Halulite. It doesn't have a handle. It does have an insulator, but it isn't built in like the Jetboil's, so you have to wrestle it off the stove with this tiny silicone pinchy thing, and then slip it into its insulator without scalding yourself. I have doubts.Some time, possibly today, I'm going to take the setup out to my porch and try making oatmeal and a hot drink with the Halulite to see how it handles under something like real world conditions. I already put hot tea in it and found that the lid makes it a dandy sippy cup when it isn't actively being used to boil things.",,Still three months ,"Jan 22, Sun",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553810,"I don't know how something this obvious got by me, but it's becoming clear to me that my favorite pack is not going to be usable for the whole hike, mostly because of the hip belt. I've had it a couple of years, and I love love love the pack. I got it for winter use but I use it all year round because I like it so much. It has more capacity to fit more winter gear, which is perfect for a thru because that means it has more capacity for food. I was fatter when I ordered it, plus it was intended to go on over winter clothing. So the hip belt that was perfect for those conditions is not going to be very snug when I'm wearing summer clothes and dropping weight due to excessive hiking. I need it to be snug enough to support the weight of the pack so it isn't on my shoulders. I *might* be able to get halfway through the trail before it's a serious problem. Or I might not. Especially for the hundred mile wilderness where I have to haul more food, I'd really like to carry this larger pack. I have a smaller, slightly less awesome one of similar design. I guess that's my fallback. Or ordering an entire new pack, which I'm not too thrilled about.",,Uh oh,"Jan 26, Thu",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554016,"Sisu is a hiker. I'd heard his name many times but ran into him for the first time this weekend at the Northern Ruck, held at Bear's Den Hostel. I asked him what his name meant. He said that it was Finnish, and there was a direct translation, but that it basically meant irrational persistence. A little light went off in my head. That's me. Irrationally persistent. Why do I like long distance hiking? I don't know, I just do. I just keep at it for no obvious reason. I decided to make it my tagline. Why not?",,I recently met Sisu,"Jan 31, Tue",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554093,"Your brain is the single most important factor in completing the trail. You might break a leg. You might get Lyme disease. You don't necessarily control that. But you do, or can, control your attitude toward the trail. Getting tired of walking in the rain or slipping off of roots or just seeing a trail through the trees for day after day is what takes most people off of the trail, not injury. Consider now what strategies work for you in getting through times in your life that are difficult. (If those strategies currently include avoidance methods like getting drunk, this might be a good time to work on new strategies. Hiking while incapacitated will circle you back to the ""break a leg"" option.) In yoga we ""set an intention"" for each class. That can mean a different thing to each person, and to each person at each different class. Some days my intention is to be kind to my sore wrist. Some days my intention is to pay attention to my breathing, to breathe fully and evenly throughout the class. Sometimes it's to keep my mind level. Sometimes it's to stay fully in my body, not to start thinking about other things. Deciding in advance how you want to handle your class or your day can be very helpful in determining the outcome.On a truly beautiful day, my intention may be to try to keep an even pace so that I can maximize my mileage. On a windy, rainy day, it may be to keep a watchful eye on my core body temperature so that I can prevent hypothermia. On a sore ankle day it may be to be mindful of my foot placement so I don't wrench that ankle again. On a tired, cranky day, it may be to savor interactions with other hikers to help my mood. Or to find jokes to tell to myself and to others.You are not helpless in the face of problems. Deciding *before* things go wrong just how you want to handle life's events is what we call being prepared. It makes a huge difference in your success and your happiness.(crossposted to facebook)",,Mindfulness,"Feb 03, Fri",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554304,"I'm still anxious to get on the trail, but not as anxious as I was. Because I have a cold. It's a normal enough thing, but it's miserable enough to have one with all the comforts of home. I'm happy to be here and not on the trail.No training this week, obviously. Maybe this weekend.It was 69 degrees today. February 7. I'm boggling. At least it's supposed to snow on Thursday. That's what February should be like.",,Annual sniffles,"Feb 07, Tue",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554453,"It's February. But it's supposed to be in the 60's today, and 70 tomorrow. I don't get it, but I will take advantage. I'm planning to put permethrin on a bunch of garments, my pack, and my tent. It doesn't last forever, but it's the best technology I have. I'll do it again midway through the hike.I got Lyme disease for the first time in 2005. Nobody was treating it in Maryland then, so the doc wasn't sure what it was and let it get really, really bad. I was dreadfully sick for a year. I've had it again a few times since then as sadly you don't build immunity. However, I have *not* gotten it when I've been wearing clothing treated with permethrin. These days it's my first and often only line of attack. Being out in the woods for days at a time, it's difficult for me to use topical repellants. You're supposed to wash those off at the end of the day, but I have no shower. DEET makes me sick, which leaves me with Picaridin. Picaridin is actually surprisingly effective, but given the choice I'd rather wear treated clothing and not keep putting things on my skin.Because I treat so many garments, I buy concentrated permethrin and dilute it, then use the soak method instead of spraying. I get a lot less exposure to the solvent in the permethrin solution that way.I suppose there are worse ways to spend a warm day in February.",,Why the heck is it warm?,"Feb 11, Sat",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554793,"I've been waiting patiently for my cold to go away, and it pretty much has. Next weekend I'm going out on an overnight with a friend, per my usual schedule. It's not really a training hike, it's just my normal habit to go out a weekend per month. But I will try to have the same gear with me that I'm planning to thruhike with. I could carry as much weight as I intend to at the start, which will include five days of food. I could, but I'm not. I haven't built up to that in my daily hikes yet. Actually this week I didn't carry any weight at all, as I was still recovering and didn't want to push it.",,Time for a little hiking,"Feb 18, Sat",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555037,"My hike this last weekend was so. Hot. And not Paris Hilton hot. Sweating so much I'm not peeing hot. And I boosted my pack weight by five pounds. I still need to boost it five more pounds to account for my initial five day food carry but Lordy, what I carried this weekend was enough. It felt like somebody turned gravity up to 11. I know it will feel lighter as time goes on, but it was a good reminder to be ruthless in pruning weight. A light pack makes a happy hiker. Question is, what do I take out? This weekend I'll be carrying the same weight but it will be a few degrees cooler and raining. I'm actually looking forward to trying out some of my wet weather gear - I'm experimenting with some wind and rain protection for my hands on my hiking poles. Waterproof mittens don't do it for me and gloves get hot. I will be interested to see if my creations make my hands happy.",,"Holy too much hotness, Batman","Feb 23, Thu",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555067,"My recent training is giving me pause. I still need to add three days of food. And my pack already feels so heavy and full. I'm reconsidering my choices.Do I really need a mug for coffee? I love it, and I've carried it on all my trips in the last few years. Some of those trips have been multiple weeks long. So obviously I can carry it, but at 3.5 oz it's 479 pound-miles. But it's really nice to be able to have a good sized hot drink and use your pot for something else.How about the tent? My altaplex is roomy and private, but so it packs a lot larger than my hexamid and needs an extender pole.Sleeping pads. I cut down a 25"" wide NeoAir so I have more room for my short but side-sleeping self than on my old 20"" wide women's xlite. But even cut down it weighs a little more than regular size, and takes up more space in shelters.Sleeping bag. I'm starting in late spring. A 20 degree bag probably isn't needed until Hanover. My 40 degree quilt sure does pack smaller and weigh less. 12.5 oz vs 22 oz.Inflatorator - about 1 oz, but not strictly necessary.Maps. I've hiked all but 90 miles of the trail. Do I really want to carry maps for areas that I've hiked multiple times? I often, though not always, remember the details of where the water and good camping spots are for areas where I've camped before. Maps are heavy suckers.Frogg Toggs rain hat. Weighs a minimal amount, but definitely a luxury. I hate hiking with a hood on. It feels clammy and I can't hear well. I suspect this hat won't make it very far before I decide it's not worth it, despite how nice it is to have on a rainy day. 2.5 oz. Crocs. Okay, I'm definitely carrying some form of camp shoe, but it won't necessarily be the one attached to my pack right now. The ankle strap adds weight, as does the extra material because this model doesn't have holes along the bottom. Both are nice in muddy or steep situations, but they weigh more. 12 oz vs 10 oz for more holes and no strap. Maybe 5 oz if one of the skimpier women's versions will fit me.These are mostly small changes but they definitely add up.",,Hard choices,"Feb 24, Fri",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555250,"I went out with DeLee to hike Keys Gap to Snickers Gap this weekend. That contains a dry section and a bit of the Roller Coaster.We spent Friday night at Bear's Den Hostel so we wouldn't have a long drive in the morning. Then we had a short but confusing diversion as we tried to find the unmarked Main Street in Round Hill. (NB: It's at the corner with Tammy's Diner.) The drive up to Keys Gap from there was super pretty. Lots of rolling Virginia countryside, horse farms, and pretty barns.Wet and stormy weather was predicted for mid-afternoon.   We both kept an eye on the sky, and when it started turning black in the west, I said ""This would be a really good time for the side trail to Blackburn Trail Center to show up."" Several seconds later, it did! That side trail has seriously good timing. We headed down hill as sprinkles fell. We were almost there, on the stone sidewalk to the building, when the skies started really opening up. Somebody on the porch opened the door and we dashed inside. As we lowered our packs and took off our raincoats, the storm intensified. Buckets of water started flinging themselves off of the roof of the porch, and hail started falling outside. It was pretty exciting. As this was going on, the caretaker walked up and asked if we wanted some coffee or hot chocolate. Yes. Yes we did! Stepping out of a storm to a safe place with hot drinks is pretty much the best thing that can happen in that situation.We waited about an hour and a half for the storm to pass over, got water, and headed out. We had intended to stop there for water or to stay the night, due to the lack of water in the area. There were a pack of Boy Scouts raising a ruckus, and it was only 1:30 when we arrived. So I got 3 liters of water for myself, DeLee filled up too, and we stepped out into the afternoon.I had remembered a good campsite up against a rock wall just south of there. Unfortunately, there is a large dead tree looming over it now. As much as I wanted the wind protection, we couldn't chance the tree falling, so we continued on.About half an hour later we found a nice flat spot overlooking the countryside to the east. It had a hill diverting some of the wind, but not all. It was the best we could do so we set up our tents, I hung a food bag, and we made dinner. As darkness fell and it got colder, we both got in our tents. There were some pretty intense gusts.I fell asleep around 8. At 9 I woke up with the sensation of being hit in the back repeatedly. My tent had collapsed and every time the wind billowed it would smack me. I got up and reset the stake that had pulled loose, but my pole extender had cracked due to the force of the event. I gave it the hairy eyeball, but I didn't have any other options than to use it like that and hope for the best.Remarkably, everything was fine the rest of the night. It dropped down about 10 degrees below the prediction, but we were both in warm sleeping bags. My feet stayed cold until morning, as per usual. Our water was fine in our tents, those the drops of water in DeLee's cooking pot froze when she left it outside of her tent in the morning.We coordinated our packing up so that neither of us packed our sleeping bag until we were otherwise ready to jam everything in the pack and go. It was too cold for one to stand around if the other wasn't ready. The very last thing was taking down the tents. As I was trying (unsuccessfully) to wrestle my cold tent into its sack, a man walked by on the trail. He stopped to helpfully inform us that we could have spent the night in a warm cabin if we had gone another couple of miles. I told him that we had come through there last night and continued working on my tent. After a bit I heard him say goodbye and move on.. which means he was standing there silently watching us for a while. Creepy. Also, thanks for implying we're idiots, jerk.The rest of the day was up and down on the Roller Coaster, which is just a chunk of trail with good press, and enjoying a cheeseburger at the Horseshoe Curve Restaurant. It was a pretty great weekend.Oh, and my pack felt great. I think I might have had it loaded wrong last week. Even with three extra liters of water, it felt better over the weekend than it did on my training hikes last week.",,I just had it loaded wrong,"Feb 27, Mon",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555756,"Last week, shortly after I got home from backpacking, and before I had started unpacking, Just Blue Skies asked me to go on another backpacking trip. Like, in three days. I said yes. Of course I did. And then I started doing stinky hiker laundry.It was intended to be a hike to shepherd some newbies on a backpacking adventure, but the predicted lows kept falling to the point where I didn't think it was safe for somebody without a fair amount of experience to be out there. Even with us there, it's just too easy to get hypothermic. And the chances of them having the right sort of gear to deal with well below freezing didn't seem too good. At one point the temperature with wind chills was supposed to be 4. The newbies did not elect to participate.It didn't get quite that cold, but it was definitely ""Don't set your mug down or the drops will freeze"" cold. ""Pack two sleeping bags"" cold. Crunchy frozen dirt cold. Unhappy alcohol stove cold.I don't know why it seems like I'm the only one whose alcohol stove gets cranky when it's cold. Even when I warm the alcohol in my pocket (which does help), it tends to go out and/or not maintain enough vapor pressure to keep flame jetting.At any rate, we still went, plus her friend Michelle. I got out a little early on Friday as I'd been working extra hours. I arrived at the parking lot for Punchbowl Shelter at 4:30. It was deserted. Unsurprising, given the weather. I headed up the hill - .4 miles up plus .2 down the side trail. I really expected the side trail to head back down the other side of the mountain because that's how it always seems to work out, but it was relatively level. The .4 up.. wasn't. At all. I was quite warm.I set up my tent (with duct taped pole extender) and then went over to the shelter to eat my dinner by my lonesome. Ham sammich and pickle slices from Sheetz. The pickle slices were amazing, actually. Somehow they managed to package them up so they tasted fresh and crisp and perfect. Come to think of it, the sandwich was good too. And JD had made me treats before I left - Rice Krispie Treats, and Fruity Pebble Treats. The latter were his invention. I was dubious but they were all right. They kind of grew on me.JBS and Michelle arrived just before dark and immediately started setting up camp. It very quickly got too cold to stand around so while they went off in search of a good branch over which to throw a bear line, I got in my sleeping bag(s). Just until they got back. Just going to warm up my feet a little. Just going to rest my eyes a moment.I woke up about 6, after perhaps the only night in my camping experience during which I did not need to trek out to a tree to pee. The sunrise was lovely, as far as my befuddled eyes could discern through the steam coming off my coffee. As has become my habit, I ate my breakfast (Rice Krispie Treats) and took my vitamins whilst ensconced in my sleeping bag(s). Then I began a carefully orchestrated routine, timed such that I changed into my daytime clothes, stuffed my sleeping bag(s), and jammed everything into my pack before I had time to get chilled. Then I popped out of my tent and struck it, the last thing that needed to go in the pack.I really need to coordinate with campmates better. All they know is there is rustling, and then I'm standing there looking at them. And all my crap is ready to go. People do not love this surprise. I'm used to this arrangement, of course. And by now I'm used to people saying ""You're packed up ALREADY?"" I visited the privy (where it seemed likely that I might freeze to the seat), read the shelter log, and generally lollygagged until it was time to start walking.We didn't walk far. First we had to shuttle a car to our destination and return to the Punchbowl parking lot. THEN we could actually hike. JBS and I teased Michelle about the mysteriously large mountain that started our theoretically pretty flat walk. Then JBS noticed plastic bags on the ground. I had breezed by them, as had Michelle. But JBS was walking at the end of our little line, and she was looking to the side rather than stare at Michelle's backpack.Somebody had flung two gallon sized ziplocks full of hiker food to the east side of the trail, and a gallon sized ziplock with a novel and a brand new notebook to the west side.We speculated on what exactly had happened. In the end, the only thing to do was take the stuff with us. We couldn't in good conscience leave it littering the forest floor. JBS took the books and I took the food. The heavy, heavy food. I spent the rest of the day and the following morning inviting people to eat anonymous hiker's tuna, poptarts, instant breakfast, oatmeal cream pies.. ANYTHING. It was heavy. I couldn't fasten my pack back up because it was crammed full of food. Fortunately it wasn't too much of a burden to actually carry, although of course I would have preferred not to add several pounds to my already bulky winter load.We ran into thruhiker Turkish who declined to take any food. He seemed to be doing well, despite his freakish disinclination to take free food.Saturday night we camped near Brown Mountain Creek Shelter. It was still well below freezing but there was nary a breeze so it felt a lot warmer.Sunday morning I sat there in my down gear feeling toasty warm while JBS and Michelle packed, and was surprised to see that the contents of my Nalgene had turned to slush when I set it down. Those were some pretty great down pants I was wearing. (Goosefeet Gear, FYI.)It was only a two mile walk to the waiting car, then a drive back down the Blue Ridge Parkway to Nannette, my waiting RAV4. There was a chilly looking hiker and a dog standing at the corner of the lot when we got there. We offered him the hiker food and finally got a taker! Then we asked him if he needed a ride anywhere. He wanted to go to a motel in Glasgow. I convinced him to go to Buena Vista instead, as there isn't actually a motel in Glasgow. We chatted about hiker things on the way to town. I took him to the second motel, the one closest to other businesses, but it was closed. So back to the Buena Vista Motel we went.Once M&M secured a room I headed home, ravenously hungry. I stopped for food twice. It would have been three times but Triple Oak Bakery in Sperryville is no longer selling directly from their shop. (So sad!)Upon unpacking my car, I found M&M's gloves. I felt bad but it was way too late to do anything about it other than leave a message at the motel so he was alerted to pick up replacements.It was a pretty great weekend, I must say. Beautiful, if chilly weather. Friends. Hiking without injury. The chance to do a good deed. I had a wonderful time.",,Fun times in the Blue Ridge,"Mar 06, Mon",0
Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556112,"Zpacks tent comparisons. I have a 5 year old blue Hexamid Solo-Plus. Love it and have used it for many happy miles, but the color is a bit translucent and you have get down pretty low to get in it. I got a camo Duplex. It packs up too large for my needs, and I can't reach everything in the tent from one position. Next a camo Altaplex. *Really* easy to get into with the tall door, but I have to use a pole extender with my trekking pole, I can't reach the roof while seated, and the pole extender just isn't stable enough for my preference. The added height gives it more vulnerability to wind. (Sadly, I've had both Altaplex and Hexamid in pretty serious wind, so I know this for sure.) Finally, a camo Hexamid Solo-Plus showed up in the bargain bin and I bought it. I miss the easy use entrance of the Altaplex, but the Hexamid has more usable head and shoulder room. The Altaplex is taller, but since the pole is outside the mesh, the volume (at my shoulder and head height) is considerably reduced by the mesh being closer to the center of the tent. The camo Hexamid (not including stakes, but with an internal bathtub tarp attached) comes in at about 18 oz. The camo Altaplex (not including stakes or extender pole) comes in at about 19. Not a significant enough difference to matter, to me.Since I bought my first Hexamid, they've changed the door design from a single beak that rolls down to two doors that meet in the middle. I like the latter design. The beak worked, but was a little fiddly to do and undo, and difficult to get taut. The doors are pretty straightforward, and I can just have one open while the other blocks wind or provides privacy.The Hexamid provides better room under the doors than the Altaplex in my opinion, if you want to leave things under cover.I put the Hexamids and Altaplex in tall, slim stuff sacks so they can go in an outside pocket of my pack. The sacks are about the size of a bolster pillow, so I added clips and loops (available on tough adhesive from Zpacks as well) to the sacks and to my sleeping pad so that I can keep them in place. I also added a small piece of elastic cord so I can snug them into place around another pad if desired. Sometimes I sleep with my head on the bolster, sometimes I use it just to hold in place something softer like my clothing stuff sack. Works pretty well.I added a stick on loop to the top of my new Hexamid so I can hang a hankie or whatever to it to dry. I also tied few small pieces of reflective line to various tieouts, as the line that comes with the tents is plenty visible during the day but not so much at night.",,Tent thoughts,"Mar 11, Sat",0

I want to meet new people, explore new places, and see what is around the next corner.I am going to take my time, hiking for the smiles rather than the miles. I have four months left of this amazing vacation. I may or may not make it to Katahdin or even Maine. But I intend to have a darn good time trying.Given that I am an adult with plenty of savings, I am not going to live more Spartan a lifestyle than I have to. I will go to B&Bs. Even in New England. I will drink the good beer. I'll get the best food I can to carry into the woods. I will eat steak.I will also ignore my surroundings and focus on a book or music if I feel like it.

On the other hand, it feels like I will *never* actually get to Harper's Ferry to start my journey. Days keep happening and they keep not being THE day.But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about.Thruhiking is an interesting combination of giving up and gaining control. You give up control of many things. Your former job, if you had one. Your home's care. Your pet's care. Your loved one's care. You have no control over the postal service or the businesses along the trail, which you need to provide you with food and equipment and medications. You have no control over the weather, which you will face every day. You have no control over other hikers, who might turn out to be assholes. Or snorers. Or shelter hogs. (Or they might be your best friend. It's mystery.) And you SURE don't control the trail itself. You take it as it comes. You have to.But you gain all sorts of control over your choices. Occasionally hikers chafe at restrictions on where they can stay and what they can do, because they have grown accustomed to the freedom that the trail usually gives them. *I* choose how far I will walk today. *I* choose what food to carry, whether that means several baggies of powder to rehydrate into soup, or an entire pizza packed out of town. I choose to sleep in a Taj Mahal tent, or under a tiny tarp. My choices may bite me in the ass, but they are MY choices. It is hard to convey the incredible sense of freedom that comes with putting your loaded pack on your back, knowing that you have everything you need and nobody telling you what to do.   You can literally walk away from boredom, noise, pollution, and in most cases responsibilities, chores, and commitments. These things will all be waiting for you to get back to them. During the hike you set them aside. The more of them you have to set aside, the better it feels to do it. I think young and old hikers experience the trail differently in many ways, but this is a big one. Young hikers haven't had much to set aside. They seek an adventure, and it is all exciting and new. Older hikers make arrangements so they can go, but in most cases it means that for the first time in years, they aren't paying the mortgage, taking out the trash, cleaning the litterbox, earning the paychecks, and following the routine. Such relief to lay down that burden for a time!

This weekend I’ll put my sleeping bag in my pack - I don’t feel too bad about having it stuffed for that long. Now I’m focusing on other tasks, like getting house maintenance done before I leave.

(I realize that this probably sounds like hippie granola babble to you, but I assure you that it’s based on real science. The polysaccharide molecules in the aloe stimulate your fibroblasts to produce more collagen. I have loose ligaments. Taking the aloe produces more collagen, which in turn helps my ligaments be thicker and tighter.

Like SERIOUSLY you KILLED another LIVING BEING and then you WORE ITS SKIN? Fine, serial killer.And then you try to explain that we didn’t actually kill the sheep, we just gave them annual haircuts, and they kind of liked it because they got really hot with all that hair, but yes we did kind of kill the cows and wear their skins. And gave their bones to our dogs, until it got fashionable to drink bone soup. But we ate their meat so it was fine! No waste! And my great-niece is just giving me that look that you give old ladies who will just say anything they feel like and there’s nothing you can do about it.I promise that this is hiking related.I started hiking as a kid with my folks when we went places where hiking was the thing. National parks, state parks, local parks. It wasn’t a hobby, it was just the thing you did when you went there. My first backpacking trip was as a teenager after my mom invited her friend Betty Manning over to tell my Campfire group about backpacking, because Betty was a backpacker. It all seemed surreal and a little futuristic. You packed everything up really tiny. I specifically remember us marveling that you could fold underwear up to the size of a cigarette pack. Why a cigarette pack? I don’t know. It’s not like any of us Campfire girls smoked. But that was our measurement.The backpacks were not waterproof. They didn’t necessarily have any zippers. They were basically heavy duty nylon bags, with pockets sewn on (not very many pockets) that were hung from tube of metal. It was exactly as much fun to carry as it sounded. Not much fit in them, but what was in them was heavy. I don’t think we weighed our packs before our initial hiking trip. But I’m pretty sure they were heavier than what I carry now. In the picture, my little teenage self was bent forward under the load.I *did* measure the weight for a trip in college (similar gear, but now the sleeping bag was a little smaller) and I recall for one trip it was 51 pounds. 51! I don’t even like to carry 25 pounds now. And that pack still wasn’t waterproof. It did have zippers, which tore my hands to shreds when I reached past their teeth into my pack. It still hung on sizable metal tubes. My gear today seems pretty far removed from those early adventures. My sleeping bag weighs under a pound and fits in a summer sausage sized stuff sack, almost. My pack weighs a pound, and it’s waterproof, and it has many wondrous pockets which don’t rip the flesh off my hands when I reach into them.

All my reasons for leaving still apply (and they aren’t just this thruhike). I still think they’re good reasons. But I felt the sort of loss one feels after a death or a breakup. So much of my life (a full half of my years) has been focused on my job at NASA. Keeping an eye and an ear out for relevant details that might affect us. Planning my schedule around the spacecraft contacts. Planning my vacations so that we always have coverage. Checking my mail constantly. Thinking of it as “us” and “we”. Taking for granted the brilliant minds I was surrounded by. Fixing problems and helping people. I knew I would be sad to leave, but damn. That was hard. I thought maybe I would feel some of the giddiness of taking off on a long vacation. Knowing you have no responsibilities for a month. No checking of email, no going to meetings, no handling of problems. Somehow, I still have all that freedom but none of the accompanying joy I’m accustomed to.

Rain was predicted and I wanted to reconfigure things so the pack cover would fit better. I reached inside and felt wetness. My scotch had exploded inside my pack. RIP, flask. You were a good flask, mostly. The scotch permeated the pack. My new food bag turned out not to be scotch resistant. Fortunately I was still in proximity to my gear supply so I swapped it out for another. My pack liner protected my bag and clothes, thank goodness. But I'm not sure how long my pack, water bladder, and stove will smell of scotch. The scotch somehow migrated into the bladder, so my water had an aftertaste of scotch all day. I like scotch as much as the next girl, and more than most, but I didn't find my scotch flavored water to be very refreshing. Hereafter April 20 shall be commemorated by me as the Great Scotch Pack Explosion Day. Also my butt kind of exploded. It felt hinky coming home from yoga last night. This morning it gave warning twinges. But it wasn't until we got to the ATC that it really went wrong. I was grateful for their bathroom. And the bathroom I luckily remembered in lower town. And the privy at Ed Garvey shelter. Explosions aside, it was a lovely day. The rain went away and the turtles came out to sun themselves. I didn't get started until 10 thanks to explosions, but I made good time on the canal. I got to my destination a little before 5. A family is staying here in the shelter with me. It's supposed to rain so I chose the shelter. We'll see. My pad feels like maybe it isn't doing a fantastic job holding air. But at least I should be dry. They offered me a hamburger- still hot! Best day ever! I had been eating some theoretically orange ginger beef jerky, which tasted exactly like regular beef jerky. The burger was freaking delicious. The family is super cute. I'm not sure if the kids are prodigies or just short for their age, but they are both well behaved and funny. I could do worse for shelter mates. I met Nicole today, who also started her flip flop today. She stayed at Ed Garvey, very intelligently deciding to start slow on the trail. I'm less bright, so I moved on. At two pm I couldn't see stopping for the day. I stumbled a few times but basically I had a good hiking day. The pack felt all right after I got used to the extra weight. I needed to carry enough water for the whole day. Which reminds me. No fewer than five people told me that the spring here was dry. I checked for myself. It's running strong. Trust but verify, folks.

I apologized for my noisy sleeping pad after two other hikers gently complained about it. Sorry, sorry, I know it's loud. But I don't hurt after sleeping on it so it stays. 
I was on the trail at 7 and found myself going faster than expected. At 10 I stopped in at Rocky Run and met Merry and Leif, Wisconsin, and Meandering Snail. After an hour or so I found myself at Dahlgren, almost two hours before I was to meet Nat - my incognito dentist. I texted him to meet me farther down the trail and headed for Mt Washington State Park. Good thing I checked my phone, because I plopped down at the first shady spot, and he was farther on. 
He had asked to wear my pack, so I got it on him and we took off walking. As usual we had a great conversation. I enjoyed walking without the pack. Nat soldiered on, carrying my heavy-ass pack, for two miles. Then I took it back from him and quickly realized how tired I was. 
I dropped him off at a parking lot and slowly walked the remaining distance to the shelter. It was too hot to do much but sit, which is what I did. Eventually I set up my tent and fished out something to eat. It's far too hot to want cooked food so I had a Greenbelly bar and some fried green beans. 
Two climbers with a Cane Corso showed up while I ate. The dog is both handsome and obsessed with a frisbee. 
For some reason no other AT hikers are here, or at least they weren't when I got in my tent.

At 6:30 I woke up and got my food so I could have breakfast in bed. For the first time, cooked food sounded good. I heated up water for a mocha- a packet of Swiss miss and two instant coffees. 
I got packed up and underway by 8. It was pleasant enough despite the rain. For the first hour I was too hot to wear my rain gear, other than my boonie hat. I stopped at Pogo Campsite to use the privy, and it started raining harder. 
I zipped things up and walked on, listening to the beginning of ""Earth Abides"". It's a great novel, though very serious. This is my fourth or fifth listen over the years. 
After six or seven miles my hands started going numb, so I dug out the pole caps I had made. My hands warmed up, but I wasn't keeping up with the chill. When I got to the next shelter I made a hot lunch but it didn't do much to warm me up. I decided to make camp and climb in my bag. 
The shelter itself was filthy - recently occupied by muddy scouts. I couldn't see setting up in there. Also there was a half of a pizza thrown in the fire pit. Gross. I knew, as well, that I would be warmer in my tent. 
I had never visited the tenting area here. It's all right. There's gravel in the tent pads and my tent doesn't want to stay up very well, but it will do for a night. And afternoon.

Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561608,"4/23Deer Lick shelters14.5 milesI have to get this off my chest. You are welcome to use the shelter system, but you are expected to share. In bad weather, the rule is that there is always room for one more. I went down to the shelter to hang my food on the bear pole and see who was about. There were a bunch of grown-ass adults, with each having claimed four to five feet of space. There was a large empty space that they wouldn't let anybody take because they were holding it for a friend. I was extremely disappointed in them. I pointed out that there was plenty of room left but not one would budge. Another cold, wet hiker showed up and they wouldn't make room. He was rightfully disgruntled and stomped off to set up his tent. A) You don't own the shelter and you DO have to share. B) For god's sake, if you MUST save a spot for your buddy (who presumably could set up his own tent) at least put your sleeping bag down on the floor so it looks taken. Denying an obviously empty space to a wet hiker is both a jerk move and cruel. ********That judgemental rant aside, today was beautiful. The miles came easily, the last mile to Raven Rock shelter excepted. I sat for a bit at Penmar where another hiker told me the miles to this shelter were rocky and difficult, but I didn't find it so.

Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561793,"4/24At Trail of Hope Hostel in Fayetteville 13.2 milesI met Grey beard, Ten Steps, and Rocket Man at the hostel. They're a nice bunch of sixtyish men. 
But first: another chilly night, though I did sleep. Uncle and I shared a shelter, with Nephew and Hand and Mouth in the other. 
I slept in a bit, then made oatmeal and hot chocolate in bed. Apparently I missed a bag when populating them with coffee. 
I packed up, then realized that I needed to pack differently so my pack cover would fit. I grumbled and Uncle made fun of me being anal retentive about how my pack is loaded. I flounced off to the privy and noticed when I got back that he was still fiddling with his. I think one of us is projecting a little bit. 
I got going at the stroke of eight. First I passed Antietam Shelter, then Uncle and Nephew getting water at the nearby park. I fetched up at Tumbling Run to tape my feet, get water, and use their sparkling clean privy. 
The hill up to Chimney Rocks was beastly. I stopped to breathe frequently. I didn't go see the actual Rocks because it was raining. No view. 
I took a picture and my screen went black. I had to do a hard reset to use it again. I sent email to JD about it and the phone crashed again. I couldn't tell if the mail actually went out. 
I left it off, and wandered on, pondering. I use the phone extensively - not least of which to write and upload this journal. So when it has problems, it's a big deal to me. Makes me anxious. This is compounded by the lack of phone podcasts, music, and books to take my mind off of things. It's a bit of a vicious circle. I was forced to listen to my own internal litany all day. 
I stopped to filter my water and the filter leaked badly, losing a quarter of a liter. I really needed that liter. I hadn't noted before leaving Tumbling Run that the water at the next shelter was a 1.6 mile round trip. I skipped it in favor of the last three miles to town. 
First, though, I changed the gasket on my filter and it was back to working again. Annoying. But I'm glad I had the spare. 
The scenery right before and after Rocky Mountain Shelters was outstanding. Towering rock walls with evergreens below. I wanted to take pictures, but see above about phone problems. 
I remembered rock scrambling from my last hike there, but I didn't remember just how much of it there was. I was ready for it to end way before it did. However, after one scramble I realized that while I was navigating the rocks, I wasn't thinking about anything. So that was nice. 
When I reached Route 30 I turned left and headed for the restaurant, which turned out not to be a pizza joint anymore. They were extremely welcoming and helpful - showing me where to charge the phone, getting the number of the fellow who could give me a ride to the hostel, and just really being very nice. Hikers are often viewed with suspicion so this was very pleasant. 
At the hostel I got a shower and finalized some arrangements with JD, who has a solution to my phone problem, we think. He will drive up tomorrow and I'll take an impromptu zero day. I hear it's good timing - the weather will be bad tomorrow. 
 Neon is also driving down tomorrow so we'll hit the trail Wednesday. Maybe she'll bring good weather with her?","Deer Lick Shelters

Unfortunately I woke up with my back in knots as I always do when I don't move much in my sleep. It's a catch 22. I got up and made coffee and started my laundry. For some reason the other hikers didn't also get up at the crack of dawn so I made myself busy putting away dishes, folding towels from the laundry, and I made a bowl of oatmeal. Then every else got up. Second breakfast at the restaurant? Don't mind if I do!Ten Steps and I walked back to the hostel, then I packed my gear up and vacated my room. I did a little yoga and wasted time until we made a Walmart run for supplies. As usual I had a lot of leftovers due to having to buy six rolls of toilet paper to get one, and other problems of that nature. I left the hiker box well stocked. I stuck some money in the donation box and then JD showed up to whisk me two minutes down the road to the motel. Our sordid meeting included a phone swap (this one has a slightly dodgy battery but probably doesn't crash regularly), some replacement clothing, and a trip to the Flamingo for coffee and pie. I always miss him when I start these long trips, and it did my heart good to look at his dear face and spend time talking to him. Just as we returned from coffee, a woman honked at us. I thought we had taken her parking space so JD moved his truck. But then came a knock at the door. The woman was Neon! Yay! We got our plans all squared away after JD left. We should have pretty weather for our hike together. I'll be glad for the company.","Fayetteville

I fooled around with my phone for a while, then made breakfast, such as it was. My pop tarts were a little too modern. Cookies and cream flavor. I want my old chocolate pop tarts back. 
I used the inroom coffee maker to heat water for instant coffee but it made pretty terrible coffee. Still, it was coffee. That's what is important. 
Neon drove us over to the hostel and Robert quick in a jiffy ferried us to Caledonia State Park. Neon right away busted out some strong hill moves and vanished up the hill. I took longer to get combobulated. I straggled behind. It's a pretty walk up to Quarry Gap Shelter, but tough. Probably the reason why it isn't a party spot. 
Neon had the feel of a restless horse about her. I told her to go on as fast as she wanted and I'd see her later. The next few hours I walked alone. When I finally did sight her again, she was tired and ready to walk a more sedate speed. We walked together the rest of the afternoon. The trail went through an area I love - deep dark forest on one side, open sunlit forest on the other. 
We got to the shelter at two. It was our planned destination but it was still early. We made a meal and decided to stay. Neon was tired, I was happy to stay, and the shelter area is very very pretty. 
My tent was still a little wet but fortunately not stinky yet. I set it up on a relatively flat spot but of course it isn't perfectly flat. My foam pad is propping up my air pad. I hope for a good night's sleep. I can't stress enough how very pleasant it is here. 
Nicole showed up at the shelter, now named Trail Snail. I also met Skeptic, You Can Call Me Al, and Hot Pants. As usual everyone seems nice. 
I have no cell signal so no evening husband chat. It's the only downside to a pretty great day. 
We walked in a cloud all morning. Every so often I would think ""I'm in a cloud!"" And it would make me laugh. It's supposed to be 84 tomorrow so I enjoyed the cool while it lasted.","Fayetteville

I fell asleep at 7 last night. I woke up at 2:30 to pee and when I got to where I was going to do that, I turned around to see my sleeping bag trailing me like a faithful hound. Dammit. It was attached to my arm by the elastic of the neck cinch. 
I led it back to the tent and told it to stay. 
In the morning it was cool and foggy. We wanted to get some miles in before it heated up to a predicted 80's. The walk to Tom's Run shelter was extremely pleasant and foggy. We stopped there for an early lunch break, and chatted with Trail Snail, Call Me Al, Skeptic, and Seadog. The maintainers have put in a *lot* of tent pads, the most I've ever seen in one place. The old shelter that burned down was replaced by a covered eating area. It's a really nice site. 
Al had already tried to reserve a room at Iron Masters for the night but it was closed for an event. We had already planned on camping past it if that happened. The trail goes right by it though. We planned to use the porch by the not yet open store to eat a snack. When I got there I saw hikers eating burgers! Michelle told us she had opened it early in anticipation of flip floppers and was trying to get the word out. She's opening it daily, 11-3. And she makes a damn fine burger. 
Afterward my stomach complained about me walking uphill while it was full. Meanwhile Neon turned into the energizer bunny. I trudged and burped and loosened my hip belt. 
We finally camped a few miles later, having found a campsite a few miles short of the next shelter. Tomorrow we will pass by another store, where I may be more cautious about midday cheeseburgers. Or I might not.","Birch Run Shelter

That was a doozy of a day. Up at 6ish, on the trail by 7. General store at 9:30, where I got a Nutty Buddy and a sandwich and some snacks. 
The day was so hot that I didn't want to eat and I was lightheaded most of the day despite the application of electrolytes and copious quantities of water. In the middle were some rock scrambles that required taking off my pack and fully committing to a hold. At the end there was a long walk through freshly turned fields. 
Oof. 
Neon texted me from the tavern so I joined her for a delicious and well earned repast. 
We are ensconced at this B&B for the night. I've showered, I need to treat a blister, and then I plan to be unconscious for a long time. Breakfast is at 7, then we head back to Boiling Springs and walk across the Lehigh Valley, where it is supposed to be even hotter tomorrow. High of 89. Help.

We slept well with a brief intermission for a really spectacular lightning storm. 
I went down and drank coffee and chatted with Bill before breakfast. Like most people he is really interesting. I made a detour out to the laundry line to get Neon's clothes which had enjoyed a refreshing natural rinse, and Joanne stuck them in the dryer for me. Once they dried I ferried them to Neon so she didn't have to greet the world in jammies. 
Joanne made a delicious breakfast which I was unable to finish. Fortified with great quantities of coffee, I was ready to go! Bill dropped us off at the ATC office in Boiling Springs. Neon had some pack management to do to incorporate her new Walmart special sleeping pad and she told me to go on ahead. I lit out (to the extent that I am capable). The miles rolled by, occasionally slipping by with me in the mud. I averaged a little over two miles an hour, which for me is like a sprint. 
Joanne had given me some ice cubes to put in my water, so I had refreshing sips of water all morning. I love that. 
At eight miles in, I detoured down Route 11 to the Middlesex Diner. I got a milkshake and other things which paled in comparison to milkshakes. Neon joined me and we had a nice time sitting in civilization for a little bit. 
Shortly after leaving the diner I remembered how much my body doesn't love milkshakes. We fetched up at the Scott farm and I dashed for the portapotty there. It's a nice example of the genre - the structure, not my dash. 
The last six miles were less fun with a hinky tummy. As usual the last mile of the day was the toughest - uphill with water from a spring. 
I finally arrived at the shelter and secured a spot for my tent next to Neon. I guess this is our last night together for now. I'll be pretty lonely for a bit until I get used to being solo again. 
After setting up I noticed smoke rising from an unattended fire. Some jackholes had themselves a fire and left it burning. With no shovel and limited water I was in a bind. I separated the logs, put rocks down on the coals to smother them, and sacrificed a liter of water to trying to put the logs out as well as I could. They were still smoking mildly but I hope are not going to reignite. I hate dying in a fire.","Boiling Springs

At The Doyle in Duncannon PA11.3 miles
I slept well but I woke up with the ground leaching the heat out of my butt. I need to sort out my sleeping pad problem. Fix it, get a new one, or put padding under it. Something. The slow leak does act as an alarm, but not a fun one.  I don't really want a new one  because I modified my old one to make it shorter and I can't do that on the trail. Maybe I should try a different brand when I eventually reach an outfitter. 
I didn't die in a fire so the sacrifice of my water last night was worth it. Still annoying but worth it. I started the day short on water of course. Luckily we ran into trail magic of water today. Convenient!
I had remembered the rocks before Duncannon as being brutal. They weren't that bad, although I do have an ouchy spot on my right foot that was aggravated. Maybe a little sprain. Maybe a stress fracture. Hopefully the sprain option. 
I had completely blocked out the stairs coming down from Hawk Rock, however. They went on and on, and when I tried to rest, mosquitoes would attack. I bet they're super fun for southbounders. 
In town I joined Neon and others at the Doyle. We had time for a beer and then Robert from Trail of Hope hostel in Fayetteville came to shuttle her back to her car there. I'll miss her. With luck she'll be back next month. 
This morning she lent me a concoction of citronella and cedar oils that actually worked to keep bugs off me. It wore off in 1:45. I enjoyed being bug free for that time but the stuff had a powerful smell, so I put my head mesh back on. I'm of two minds about the stuff. I said I didn't want to keep it, but then I think about how nice it was to hike without gnats in my face. But the smell...","Darlington Shelter

I couldn't sleep in but I could be super lazy. A danish and coffee from the Quick Mart accompanied me back to bed. I surfed the net and generally did nothing useful as the morning passed. 
Eventually my odious ways reasserted themselves and I found myself busy. I looked for the hole in my mattress. I found it, perhaps. I put a patch on the spot and we'll see. I experimented with pad and sleeping bag and found a way to attach them so maybe I'll have fewer drafts on cold nights. I sorted my food, trimmed my nails, tried and failed to make a good hanger out of rope for my water bag, and sorted my dirty clothes out for washing. 
When I judged it likely that the bar would be open, I stopped in to grab the sensitive skin laundry detergent that Vicky had mentioned, and went off to the laundromat. 
With clean clothes I returned to the bar for beer battered shrimp and hush puppies. Oh lord, hush puppies. The Marylander in me sang a silent song of praise. 
After lunch I strolled down to the ice cream place for a ""small"" soft serve come the size of my head. On the way back I decided to go sit by the river, but when I got there the wind blew fiercely. I was actually afraid for a few moments as projectiles flew by and I cowered against a wall. 
Indoors seemed like a good idea so I moseyed back to the motel. I had noticed an old favorite novel in the hiker box area, so I took it back to my room to revisit the well loved tale. (Second Queen's Own book by Mercedes Lackey, FYI. )
Around dinner time I went down to enjoy Pat's cooking again. Vicky heard my request differently than I did, so my buffalo sandwich came out plain. After some good natured bitching she took it back and returned it to me slathered in buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. Mmmm I love me some buffalo. 
Dinner was made somber by the news that a hiker had had a heart attack on the hill north of town. The Duncannon Fire Department had retrieved the body. No news yet as to who the hiker was - and I haven't confirmed with a second source yet. But it made me think of all the male hikers I had met and hope that none of them had lost their life.","Duncannon

Met Huffer and Puffer at Clarks Ferry Shelter during water break. AT 98. Paula was there too. No trail name. It was only 1:30 when I left so I encouraged her to move on with me, but at 7 I haven't seen her yet. 
The trail was steepish getting up to the ridge but for much of the day was fairly level. It was perfect hiking weather, with blue blue skies and fluffy white clouds. Only problem was the number of dead trees and widowmakers I saw. The wind yesterday knocked down a lot, and there is more ready to go. I really wanted to stay in a structure due to that factor. 
I met a young man at a road crossing who made me uneasy. He said he planned to go to the shelter too. Luckily when I got there, he had moved on and there were three normal people here instead. Trail Snail noted she was hiking ahead to tent. Hopefully she has no problem with him. 
I think my hiker hunger might be kicking in. I certainly demolished my snacks today. I wasn't carrying a specific dinner but I wouldn't have said no to one. 
It's supposed to be in the 30s Thursday night. That's a bit cold for my gear so I'm planning to go to a hostel or motel. If I have to tent I'll survive but I don't think it would be a fun night.

The word for the morning was borborygmi. My stomach started growling loudly at five. Then my bladder started up. ""I have needs too!""
On the trail at 7:05.  At 7:15, the morning ""Is that my heart or a ruffed grouse?"" check. 
I walked along Peters Mountain in perfect weather this morning. As I came down to Clarks Creek, it turned a little cloudy for a few hours. I walked in good humor, seeing no one. Mid afternoon I startled a porcupine who was southbound on the Appalachian Trail. I think his nose told him I was there, not his eyes. After a few moments of indecision he stepped up onto a big rock at the side of the trail and then scuttled up a pine tree. I found myself apologizing to him for the inconvenience. 
I reached the Yellow Springs Village tent site at 3:30. It was a little early to stop, but it was a really lovely site. As I sat on a log, pondering, the first and so far only hiker I've seen today stopped by to sign the register. 
I decided to walk on. I could get water a mile after the tent site and decide what to do after that. Once I had water, I decided to walk until 5 and then look for a place to camp. I found a sweet little spot, with a fire already laid in a fire pit. I don't know if I'll start it, but it's nice to have. 
GPS says I'm a mile from the next shelter, but I find that I prefer the idea of some privacy. On the other hand there is something scuttling under my tent so my privacy might not be as complete as I like. 
That reminds me. Digging in my pouch for a snack today, I found some granola bar crumbs that I had missed when emptying it yesterday. Looking more closely, I found mouse poop. I don't begrudge crumbs but do they have to poop everywhere?","Peters MountainShelter

I woke up when it started getting light, turned over, and went back to sleep. Finally I opened my eyes to broad daylight and decided to get up. In the process of sitting up I found out that my abdomen was very painful. There were many possible explanations so I noted it and moved on to more important details like peeing and retrieving my food bag. 
Since I slept late I decided to try to get on the trail by 8 rather than 7. I checked my watch. 7:48. Bueno. 
I breezed by the shelter a mile away and enjoyed for the third time the environs of the failed mining village in the area. Failed, but very very scenic. 
Around lunch time I was near the Swatara Gap footbridge. I had thought to eat there but some dayhikers were being a little unfriendly so I moved on. I found log benches where I-81 passed overhead, so I ate lunch and filtered water sitting under the road. And my transition to hiker trash was complete. 
Immediately after lunch my gut pain ratcheted up. Hiking uphill with a painful abdomen is just the worst. I had to completely unhook my hip belt, move my fanny pack up my torso, and unbutton my pants. Still I was gasping in pain. Finally I found a large rock not covered in poison ivy and could sit down. A few minutes semireclining against my pack made a huge difference. I'm not sure what happens with the pain and bloating or why lying down helps, but it does. Afterward I was able to refasten my hip belt and hike at a near normal pace. Note to self: research mesenteric artery. 
I passed a site where DeLee and I and Just Blue Skies had camped, which made me smile. Then I came upon a rock garden I had forgotten about. I think I'm finally getting the hang of rocks. No cussing involved. 
Due to forecast rain and my tummy issues, I really wanted to be at a shelter for the night, so I passed several pretty campsites and arrived at the shelter at 5 to discover an under construction privy. I was not best pleased, but the next shelter is 4 miles away, which would make an 18+ mile day. And I wouldn't get there until at least 7. Knowing that that shelter is fully enclosed, gets pizza delivery, and most likely has a functioning privy did not cheer me up about my decision to stay here. 
Tomorrow I hope to go to the Rock and Sole hostel. I need to recharge my electronics, get a little food, etc. It will mean another 14 mile day and I'm not sure how long it will take me. But my other options aren't spectacular. 
I'll try to get going early tomorrow so I can get there as early as possible. Then I think it's yet another 14 mile day plus the need for a ride to Hamburg. I don't know, with all that going on, I might take yet another day off. My feet sure wouldn't mind.","One mile south of Rausch Gap

As expected it was raining this morning. I suited up and headed out. I can handle rain. I can handle wind. But put them together and its hypothermia city. When I got to the 501 shelter I wasn't sure what I was going to do but I knew I was done hiking for the day. 
My original plan had been to hike to route 183 and then go to the Rock'n'Sole hostel. I had the options of getting a shuttle to a motel, staying at the shelter (where I could order pizza at dinner time) or getting shuttled to the hostel. The hostel offers dinner and breakfast, and the motel isn't near a grocery store. And the shelter was cold and deafeningly loud from rain on the metal roof. So I opted for the hostel, where I could get hot food and supplies. 
Craig came pretty quickly to come get me. Back at the hostel I put on borrowed sweats and climbed into a warm bunk. Spending the day doing nothing much seems nice right now. As long as I'm warm and dry it's all good. 
There's an outdoor shower I'll probably use in a bit. The rain has let up some. When I arrived cold and wet I had no desire to be naked outdoors for any reason, but a hot shower is sounding better all the time. 
Tomorrow there is predicted rain in the morning, clearing in the afternoon. Right now I'm thinking of slackpacking the ten miles from the 501 to here. My daily mileage average is plummeting. :)
Actually my daily mileage has been pretty impressive, for me at least. Except on uphills or tricky rocks, my pace is a pretty consistent two miles an hour or a little better. Still not sure why but I like it. Since I'm going literally twice as fast as I used to, it feels like the miles are flying by. I guess eventually the novelty will wear off.","William Penn shelter

After a good night's sleep and a delicious breakfast of French toast casserole and sausage, Jody dropped me off at the 501 shelter to walk back to the hostel. The day went quickly. Slackpacking PA is genius! With no pack my balance was great on rocks. The were actually kind of fun. 
I stopped for lunch at the Hertlein campsite. I think there are more established sites there now, and no sign of a picnic table. 
Hiking back up the mountain, I encountered flooded trail. At times it was up to my shins - and icy cold. There were sometimes impromptu trails on the sides, which were also flooded. I estimate I sloshed through it for a mile and a half to two miles. For much of that time there were no blazes. Not the trail's finest maintenance. 
Craig picked me up at the road around 1:30. Back at the hostel, new hikers had arrived - One Way, One More, And Grumpy. We all went to the store and to a microbrewery in a guy's garage that Craig knew of. Three of us split a growler of ESB. Mmmm, beer.

I don't think its possible for me to overstate how much I like The Rock'n'Sole hostel. Craig and Jody are delightful people. The bunkroom, though it's built into a former shed, is clean and cozy. Dinner and breakfast are built into the deal, and they're *good*. Jody is a fabulous cook. The breakfasts are better than what I've gotten in most B&Bs, and the dinners are tasty, filling, and involve actual vegetables - which I crave after eating trail food. 
Jody dropped us off this morning. The four men and I were amused to discover that we were all wearing blue raincoats. We hiked together for a while, but the men soon outpaced me. Most were planning to go to Eagle's Nest shelter five miles in. I planned on a fourteen plus mile day, putting me in Hamburg to buy some warmer gear for cold nights ahead. 
I walked through a prescribed burn zone. The burn was three days ago. It was eerie to walk through the burned area, which was extensive. I walked in it for over an hour. When I reached the end of it, green slapped me in the face. The transition from bare branches and blackened wood to a wall of bright spring green was nearly overwhelming. 
At 11 I stopped by a campsite to eat lunch. I noticed a sleeping bag in the woods that looked like it had a person in it. After calling and receiving no response, I walked back and nudged it. My heart nearly stopped when the first thing I saw was a glove, but it was an empty glove. The sleeping bag was soaked and heavy, but I determined that there was no body underneath.  Mission accomplished ( and day simplified - I really didn't want to call 911 about another body) I ate lunch and then moved on. 
Shortly thereafter I met my only other hiker of the day - Chris/Southwind. We spoke briefly on a fairly steep hill. He said he helped organize the Flip Flop Festival and I wondered if he were Laurie Potteiger's husband but didn't ask. 
I kept walking. I wasn't in the mood to listen so the earphones stayed stowed. My body was in one of its ""everybody out!"" moods so I stopped to dig a hole on several occasions. 
I grabbed some snacks from my fanny pack and found the zipper failing. That fanny pack has served me day and night on many, many hikes. It's gotten worn so thin that the fabric is nearly translucent. I have never found anything I like as much to replace it, but I'll be forced to do without it now. Vale, worthy fanny pack. 
Right before the steep downhill into Port Clinton, I sat down on a rock to take a break. Hail started immediately. I watched in disbelief as it bounced off my knees. Then I hauled myself upright and headed downhill. Hail just reinforced the point that I needed some warmer gear. 
When I hit the Schuylkill trail I headed down it as fast as I could go. I passed several locals walking or biking, and one hiker that I've met several times. He was headed back to the trail. Eventually I got to the end and followed the road into town until I reached the Microtel. I've stayed there before so check in was fast. 
I wasn't sure I had the energy to stay awake after 17+ miles of walking. But I showered and visited the attached bar for dinner, then bought laundry soap at the front desk. 
Walking back to my room I noticed a woman in hiking clothes and introduced myself. She turned out to be Furby, who I knew from facebook. We chatted briefly but my feet were killing me so I excused myself back to my room. 
I don't have the energy to stay up so I'll do laundry in the morning before I attack Cabela's and Walmart to take care of my various needs.

It's a zero day but as usual I walked miles to get to the Cabela's and Walmart. They look so close but of course they aren't. Especially not when you're forced to follow roads rather than walk in a straight line. 
I ate breakfast at the motel, then waited for things to open. At 8:40 I started walking to Cabela's. But I was already hungry again. So first I stopped at Dunkin Donuts. 
At Cabela's I searched the entire store looking for things I needed. A sleeping bag liner and some form of long johns, and a new fanny pack. I kinda wish I had gone to Walmart first, because the fanny pack I finally settled on turned out to be quite uncomfortable after I wore it a couple of hours. It rests squarely on my bladder. 
On the way to Walmart I stopped at Five Guys for a little snackerooni. Then I had to climb a steep hill and a traffic barrier to get to Walmart. They did not design the shopping area with pedestrians in mind. A lady saw me walking up to the store from the back of the parking lot and asked if I had parked all the way out. No, I parked quite a long way away from here. 
In Walmart I nearly panicked when I couldn't find kinesiotape, but they had it in the camping section. I seriously don't know if I could hike without it. I also found a $5 fanny pack that seems like it might work. And a variety of other objects. I once again bought six rolls of toilet paper so I could have one. That's getting old fast. 
At dinner I found out that French onion soup and Buffalo wings do not go together.

On the way up the trail I crossed paths with flip floppers Luna and Hootie. We introduced ourselves at Windsor Furnace Shelter where we all stopped for lunch. 
On the hike up to Pulpit Rock I met Tada going southbound. He's friends with my friends Birdy and Turtle. He was specifically on the lookout for me. He took a picture and asked how I was doing. It was nice to chat for a second before I headed back up hill, and also nice to able to reply honestly that I am very, very happy. 
I had forgotten how much of today involved easy woods road walking. I was able to walk quickly most of the afternoon, which got me to camp before five but also left me tired. I was eyeing some nice campsites a mile before the shelter but roughed it out to get here. My various parts request that I actually apply that kinesiotape that I bought yesterday rather than just carrying it. 
The shelter was fairly full but on a beautiful night like this I would rather tent anyway. The shelter held zero appeal. I set up my tent at the lovely site across the road. I started making my dinner - cheese pasta things that I got at the hostel. Then Hootie hollered my name and said the caretaker had made a pot of really good soup. I chose to stick with my dinner, as it looked good and I've carried food uneaten far too many times. 
Also here tonight are Grumpy, Discount, Furby, and One Way, as well as others I don't know. Everybody else is up at the shelter, chatting or tucked in to their bunk. I, however, am enjoying stretching out in my tent. I'm looking forward to a warm night with my new silk liner, silk bottoms, and fleece top. 
I recall from 2010 that the rocks seemed to get very bad right after this shelter. We'll see if my perception is the same this year. Things have generally seemed easier this year, despite the longer miles I've been doing. Lyme had really kicked my butt last time. I think I mostly kept going on determination and willpower.","Hamburg

I woke up at 4:45 and persuaded myself back to sleep until 5:30, then got up. It was nice to use the flush toilet available at Eckville. Nobody in the shelter was up yet so I crept in as quiet as I could and grabbed my food bag. 
Returning to my tent, I breakfasted on Cap'n Crunch from the hiker box at Rock'n'Sole as well as a caffeinated Crystal Light. It was a warm morning so packing up was pleasant. I got more water and was on my way by 7:10. 
The walk up the mountain had me fountaining sweat. Up at Dan's Pulpit I signed the register and turned to face my doom: tough rocks which I knew went on for hours. They were hard on the feet but my attitude was unimpaired as I already knew the score and was prepared for it. 
It took five hours to go seven miles. I was ever so ready to get to the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter for a full on boots-off lunch. My hiker hunger has definitely kicked in. I ate a tortilla with a lot of cheese and pepperoni in it. It was delicious. I added a little birthday cake in the form of a Devil Dog, some dried pineapple, and some Combos. Mmm. 
The weather news looked a little grim when another hiker checked it. An inch of rain on Saturday. At least it isn't the day I climb Lehigh Gap. I think my plan will be to find a ride into Wind Gap to a motel. I'll need groceries anyway. 
The afternoon's walking was much easier, mainly along old woods roads. But I was tired from the morning. I got water from the outside tap at Blue Mountain Summit and was ready to camp. 
One Way was there getting water too. We leapfrogged down the trail. I had thought to stop just before the Knife Edge but we found a pretty site a little earlier. It's a windy site, as it turns out. I hope I sleep okay with my tent flapping.","Eckville shelter

It dawned pink and pretty and cold. I got our food bags down and marveled at how One Way's had three days of food but was a third the size of mine with in theory one day of food. And once again realized how ludicrous I am about hiking food. 
The Knife Edge was easier this time around. The lack of thunderstorms helped. 
I spent a portion of the day wondering how to handle the predicted torrential rain this weekend - up to three inches over two days. I decided to get enough food and fuel to be able to spend a zero in the woods, as I won't be close enough to anywhere to bail out. A day in my sleeping bag is neither fun nor very comfortable, but I can do it. If circumstances change I can go to a motel after all with no harm done. 
Mid afternoon I met a man sitting next to the trail surrounded by goodies. Trail Angel Stan offered me a cold soda and a variety of snacks. What a treat! We chatted for a few moments, then my tired feet and I moved on. 
At the end of the day an old online friend, Nina Leopold, came and picked me up and took me back to her house. After I showered she drove me hither and yon for the aforementioned food and fuel, and also a very good pizza. She and I and Sue ate and chatted and had a fine time. And then I retreated to the guest room because it was way past hiker midnight. I shall be asleep presently.","New Tripoli campsite

Time passes differently on the trail. You have so many experiences every day that you actually seem to live more. Every day is chock full from sun up to sun down. Every day here feels like a week to me. Life back at home feels remote.  The news, for a wonder, feels distant. I really only care about the weather forecast. 
Nina and Sue dropped me off at the Palmerton trailhead around 7:45 and I headed up the mountain. The trail up is legendary. There is one place, same as last time, where I needed to take off my pack to get myself up a rock face. Mostly it was just hard work, not difficult. Of course my freshly resupplied pack was bobbing around, pulling me off balance. But it was fine. Sweaty, but fine. 
The damage to the environment from zinc smelting is healing nicely. There is a pleasant young forest once you get to the top. Some of the grasses still look stressed, but it's a huge change from the former moonscape. 
The day passed smoothly. I saw few hikers. Mostly the trail followed a ridge line. There were lots of toe grabbers and ankle twisters among the rocks though. 
At my first possible stop, the Delp Trail campsite, it was mid afternoon and I still had energy. I pressed on to the shelter. With bad weather coming I had already planned a zero for tomorrow, and I'd rather do it somewhere with room to move around. And a privy. And a water source. And company. 
I got to the shelter around 6:30 to find one other occupant. Jimmy is a section hiker who has done a lot of the trail. He made good company for the evening. 
I walked down the hill to get lots of water rather than do that task in the rain tomorrow. 
I was too tired to eat a real dinner. I munched on some dried fruit so I could take my meds and called it good. I have plenty of food to make up the difference tomorrow, and cooking will give me something to do. 
I read in the register that a porcupine frequently visits to chew on the shelter steps. He showed up very shortly after dark. He ran off when I went to look, but came back shortly after I got back in my bag. Jimmy got up and hit him with a shovel, and he left for good (for the night). I feel bad for the porcupine but they're very destructive and I don't know how else you dissuade one from eating the structure you're in.","Lehigh Gap

I have never zeroed in a shelter before. It's a little weird. I woke up at the regular sunrise time but remembered that I wasn't going anywhere and went back to sleep. 
Finally I had to get up and use the privy. Funny how it seems much closer in the daylight. :) It's a pretty nice privy. There's a sign in it that says ""throne room"". Humorously there is a sign asking you to latch the door at top and bottom to keep porcupines out, but a porcupine has chewed away the bottom latch. 
The forecast has been revised down to under an inch of precipitation today, which is still quite a bit. It's going to be in the 40s until afternoon. I know myself well enough to know that I'm likely to get hypothermia, especially as I can't hike fast enough over rocks to keep my temperature up. Jimmy decided to walk into town to get a motel room and courteously invited me, but I'll stick it out in the shelter. The hot shower and bed don't appeal enough to endure the hypothermia on the way there. 
At not even ten AM, I'm pretty bored. I should have taken JD's advice and packed out a novel, but I didn't see any at the store. I can entertain myself texting JD for a while until my battery runs low. After that I'll have to make my own entertainment.","Leroy Smith Shelter

George, section hiker and retired hospice administrator, walked up to the shelter just at dinner time. He made a pleasant companion for the evening. He seemed to me to be a remarkable man. I've never met anybody who both aced organic chemistry and thought it was boring. I think maybe his trailname should be Smart Guy. 
The porcupine did not make an appearance. Either Jimmy dealt it a fatal blow with the shovel, or he at least discouraged it. 
In the morning I made coffee, bid George goodbye, and set out on the trail again. The rocks were bad. I mean, bad even for Pennsylvania. I took my first fall, and narrowly avoided several others only by painful twisting and wobbling. I wrenched both knees, both ankles, crushed toes on both feet, and developed new blisters. Old blisters came back to life. 
About that time I started cussing. I'm so over Pennsylvania. I pretty much lost my temper with the state, and said things I don't regret but won't repeat. I know I've said this before, but this time I really mean it: I'm never hiking here again. If I should by some twist of fate find myself doing another long distance hike that involves Pennsylvania, I'm skipping the section from Hamburg to Delaware Water Gap. Maybe give it a snappy name like the Painless Thru. 
About the time I was getting my hate on, I was passed by thruhiker Unknown Yet and his friend H. I like to imagine that H is like Q but with camping gadgets instead of spy gadgets. 
When I got to the bypass trail for Wolf Rocks, I took it. You bet your bippy I did. Please see my slow hike manifesto if you have any confusion on this point. Even if I hadn't hiked Wolf Rocks before, I would know that it's a bad sign when they name rocks. The blue blaze turned out to be extremely pretty, with soft, kind dirt to walk on. It was hard to keep my mad on while Pennsylvania was sucking up to me like that, but I'm holding a grudge. 
Oh, also it rained (and hailed) for an hour or so. Apparently my backpack is a sieve now. It was wet inside when I got to this shelter. My gear is all sort of simultaneously wearing out. 
I guess after I get a replacement sleeping pad I'll think about a replacement backpack. And socks, and shoes. And pants. 
My wool buff is still fine, FYI. 
Cocoa was at the shelter when I got here, so I have company tonight. Even though he fell asleep at 6:30, I'm happy he's here. My subconscious sentries turn off when there's another human around and I sleep more soundly. 
I sorted out my food bag when I got here and determined that there is four days of food left in it. Given that in theory I left the Leopolds with four days of food, I'm thinking that there is some kind of tesseract in my food bag. Buying the Zpacks food bag is saving me a ton on food costs. I didn't even know you could make a tesseract out of cuben fiber. 
I doubt I'll find it in town, but what I really want are an icy cold Shocktop beer and an order of fries. And a cheeseburger. And another icy cold Shocktop. Also clean clothes, but there is a dearth of laundry facilities in town.","Leroy Smith Shelter

Cocoa and I woke up around dawn and got moving. Well, Cocoa got moving. I visited the privy, got my food out of the tree, and got back into my sleeping bag to make coffee. It was chilly! Finally after a couple of hours of leisurely sipping and packing, I got walking. It was a very short day into town. I passed dozens of day hikers heading up Mt Minsi. 
In town I stopped at the post office to get my mail drop. I quickly unpacked it so I could give the box back for recycling before the PO closed at noon. I had forgotten how much I packed. I didn't need to buy anything else. 
I stopped by the outfitter to buy a sleeping pad but they only had Big Agnes pads and I didn't want those. I decided to live with my leaky pad a little longer and ordered a Klymit pad to be delivered to home so JD could bring it when he came to visit me.  While I was at it I also ordered a new watch. My current watch fell off my arm when I changed clothing this morning. The strap separated halfway down. Crazy. 
After that I stopped by the bakery  for their special - a hot dog and a slice of pie. Both were great. I was disappointed to notice that the diner next door had changed ownership and wasn't open. Also I googled the Pocono Inn and saw that the reviews since I last visited had declined wildly. 
Based on that and the diner being closed, that side of town looked less appealing. I decided to go to the hostel instead. I thought it would be just me and Cocoa and Yogi, but a ton of people showed up. People will be sleeping on the floor. 
Yogi and I and Fax Machine went to the Sycamore Grill to have a couple of beers and I had a great salad. Then Luna showed up, Fax Machine departed to do some laundry, and Luna, Yogi and I went out for pizza. Yes, we went directly from one restaurant to another. Hiker appetites are amazing. 
I'm really looking forward to hiking New Jersey. I love the trail there! And on Friday I get to see JD! And Neon is joining me again! The last few days in Pennsylvania will seem like a bad dream.","Kirkridge Shelter

I found a dead tick on my sock when I undressed yesterday. Which, eek! A tick! But also yay! The permethrin is working! 
I also found one on that sock when I undressed tonight. Different tick though. 
Last night I slept well but with no natural light in the bunkroom I couldn't tell what time it was. At one point I was convinced it was dawn. I fumbled for my watch and it was more like 1:30. Finally I saw somebody else standing and knew it must be time. I got up as quietly as I could and went to stand in line for the one bathroom. I extremely skillfully changed into my daytime clothes whilst peeing. I managed to only kick the cabinet three times.
I ate my calzone leftovers (which sadly did not include sauce) for breakfast with my leftover ginger ale. When I started pondering how I was going to get some caffeine, another hiker who had to leave the trail offered me a couple of Cafe Bustela instant coffee packets. They made good coffee.  While my eyelids were flapping up like a released window shade, he told me it was espresso. Very very effective wake up juice. 
I got on the road, literally, shortly after 7. There is a longish road walk across the river between PA and NJ. I finally put feet on dirt and started heading uphill, quickly passed by all the younger thruhikers. There were rocks of course, but the difference between yesterday and today is these rocks weren't trying to kill me. 
Despite the espresso I had a low energy day. My right sciatic nerve was doing all sorts of things to my leg, and there was a hard knot in my left lower back.  Very uncomfortable. My pack was a little heavy with resupply, but not excessively slow. I guess it was just my body being pretty normal, for it. 
After a quick lunch on the summit of Kittatinny Mountain, I trudged on until I reached the turnoff to the Mohican Outdoor Center. In my other traversals I never went there so I figured I might as well have a look see. The store there was dinky. My attempts at getting food were almost a complete failure for various reasons. I almost got hummus but it was made with bell peppers in it. My grilled cheese was grilled on one side, soggy with oil but ungrilled on the other and only half melted in the middle. My coke was warm. But they brought me ice for my coke and the sandwich came with potato chips. The chips and cold coke went a long way toward reviving me. I used their wifi to download new podcast episodes, refilled my water at their tap, and lounged on their sofa until I felt revived enough to continue on my way. 
Immediately after I got on the trail a man wearing a ..clown outfit? He came bounding toward the trail toward me, giggling. Guys I met shortly after said they were in radio contact and playing some sort of game. Whatever it was looked fun. 
Arriving at my planned destination I found Cocoa and several other hikers I didn't know. Dinner was Sticky Rice with Mango. Delicious, but too much. I hope it's good for breakfast tomorrow. 
It's supposed to be near 90 the next three days. I'm better at dealing with cold weather than very hot weather. I'm pretty sure it's going to be miserable. Im hoping that at least tomorrow night I can stay at a motel to recover from the heat of the day.

It was one of those nights where I felt like I didn't sleep well until near dawn. Then it was time to get up. I wanted to walk as far as I could before it got too hot. 
The morning passed quickly as I said hello to old familiar places- the rock walled beaver pond, the pretty walk on the ridge up to blue mountain road. Near the trail to Buttermilk Falls it started to feel truly hot. I could feel the intensity of the sun on the back of my neck and on my hands. I couldn't wait to get down out of the sun. 
Finally the trail wended its way down to a stream where DeLee and I camped last year. I walked over the bridge and sat down on a log. I could stay here during the heat and walk on later, or I could go now - with the day only getting hotter. 
I decided to throw the tent up so I could climb in and lie down on my air mattress. Between ticks, flies, and gnats, lying down without the tent wasn't an option. 
I did some chores, and now I'm just hanging out until it gets cooler. My mileage will definitely be reduced, which makes the question of when and where I'm meeting JD and Neon interesting. 
At 2:30 a hiker walked by without breaking stride. He didn't even get water. Remarkable. 
By 3:30 enough hikers went by for me to be shamed/galvanized into action. Or I rested enough. One of those. I struck the tent, filtered water, made a smoothie, delayed some more, and finally, slowly started up Rattlesnake Mountain. 
I once again didn't see a rattlesnake on Rattlesnake Mountain but I did see one the next hill over. It got pretty snippy with me. Fine, whatever.

Pretty much everybody else in the shelter slept in their underwear last night. It was blasted hot. I'm too paranoid about bugs so I slept with my silk liner over me. It worked great! Sometime in the dark of the night I pulled my sleeping quilt out of the bag and dragged it over my shoulders. It was perfect. 
Well before dawn, as the birds got loud, I gave up sleeping. I was motivated to get to the road to the deli. A cold coke, a breakfast bagel..  talk about your powerful impetus. I sat up, grabbed my hygiene bag, and put drops in my right eye. I immediately realized that in the dark I had in fact grabbed my dropper bottle of concentrated liquid soap. As I gasped in pain, I fumbled for the actual eye drops to flush my eye out as well as possible. The soap has since been relocated to a different bag. 
The agony slowed me down but I still packed up and hit the trail before six. I chugged on, dreaming of breakfast. Peanuts and Splash passed me quickly, starting another 25 mile day. Shortly after that I found out how worn out my shoes are as they slipped on rocks and I fell down. I was okay and took advantage of the break to eat a cookie before I got up. 
Reaching the road, I was dismayed to find the deli empty and closed. I checked other businesses and couldn't even find a coke machine. I returned to the deli to sit on the hiker bench to eat some kind of breakfast. Not what I really wanted, but it was good enough. 
I headed up the mountain, looking for Gren Anderson Shelter so I could get water. I had planned on getting water at the deli so this was a big deal. I had run dry before I got to the stream just before the shelter. It was colored with tannins but met my need. I think. I haven't died from it yet anyway. 
A little after noon I got up to Sunrise Mountain Pavilion and sat down on the cold stone to cool off. I had some new blisters forming so I pulled off my socks and then found a tick attached to my foot. I don't understand why he was attached under my permethrined sock. Wouldn't he have had to crawl down? Under tight clothes? Ticks typically crawl up. I guess this one was a rebel. 
Fortunately I looked it up and found it was a dog tick, not a deer tick. In theory dog ticks don't carry Lyme. 
I trudged on, carrying the heavy and gradually diminishing four liters of water I had gotten from the stream. When I arrived at Mashipacong Shelter I settled in to wait out the hottest hours of the day, eating snacks and drinking water. Peregrina showed up soon after. She found that the bear box had gallons of fresh water, and even two sodas! (And a beer.) I helped myself to a Pepsi and a liter of water. Big Bird arrived and decided to stay. 
Finally at five Peregrina and I set out for the next shelter. We had a lovely chat over the next couple of miles. Rutherford Shelter is .4 miles off the trail so I've never gone to it, but it had the attraction of actually having water. And it puts me that much closer to Unionville tomorrow. I'm back on schedule to meet JD and Neon. 
Amelia Earhart was in her tent when we got here. The three of us had a nice time around the picnic table, then I dove into my tent. When I got undressed I found heat rash covering much of me. Good times! I hope it doesn't get worse. I've had to take days off because of it before. My salt encrusted clothing can't be helping.

I slept so well in my tent, but the longed for change in the weather didn't happen, so I awoke to another hot day. Botheration. 
Last night a bird started its cadence. ""Is that a whippoorwill?"" asked Peregrina. ""Yes."" I growled. I hate camping near one. It, of course, did not shut up for a good long time. 
The heat continued sapping the life out of me. Usually the woods are an endless source of beauty and wonder but today they were just an obstacle between me and my husband. I begrudged every hill, every difficulty that forced me to pause to regroup. I didn't even stop in at the secret shelter, just continued through the woods as speedily as I might. 
Of course, it was pointless seeing as how I got to town mid-afternoon and JD wouldn't be there until early evening. Friday traffic all the way from D.C. to northern NJ.

I'm not sure about the pad. It's a Klymit Static V2. At first nap its less comfortable than my neoair. I'll give it a little time. 
My feet stayed swollen the whole time. Trying to remember if this happened on my first thru. No idea, really. 
I satisfied my veggie and protein cravings at Chipotle and at Outback Steakhouse. That was a damn fine steak. 
It was wonderful to spend time with JD. Walking away from him again will suck, as usual. 
Nota bene to other hikers: while Amelia Earhart and I sat at the gazebo in Unionville, a youngster approached it and started a conversation. He and his friends have been fighting, playing, and drinking there. They're responsible for a lot of the damage to the gazebo. He says they get violent when they drink.

Walking out of Unionville I realized I needed to pee so I stopped when I found a private spot. As soon as I took off my pack, my body announced a surprise poop attack. I was forced to dig a hasty hole in a poison ivy patch. I realize that there will be repercussions following this rash act. 
I picked up Neon at Pochuck mtn shelter and we headed up the hill. An hour or two later we found Peregrina filtering water and she joined our merry band. It was fun for me to see them encountering the amazing swamp boardwalk. The weather was perfect for hiking. 
After the boardwalk we stopped by Heaven Hill Farm for a snack. I got root beer, a banana, chips and salsa, and watermelon. It was really good watermelon. 
Neon took off after. In the afternoon she likes to get to camp asap. I walked more slowly with Peregrina. We made it up the next mountain okay but a rock tilted under me on the next. I windmilled and landed on my pack, banging an ankle in the process. It hurt sharply when I stood. I limped to a good sitting spot and managed to maneuver the bone back into place, but right after that I started feeling sick.

Today was a very tough day involving climbing up and down many many rocks. My shoes were sticking great until the rocks got too much rain on them. Then I had to be more circumspect. I put on an audiobook of Dune and chugged along. 
At the last road I skipped hot dog and ice cream opportunities and just headed for the shelter. I turned up before Neon because she didn't pass up on ice cream at Bellvale. :)

I woke up with different faces next to me. Neon got fed up with a persistent mosquito during the night and set up her tent. Hot Pants was still there in the morning but two others had arrived during the night, one taking Neon's vacated spot. 
Neon's face appeared above me at some point in the morning. She kindly grabbed my water bag to get me water from the spring. I thanked her and grumpily started putting on yesterday's wet clothes, which smelled like hot death and felt like refrigerated slime. 
Last night Neon had suggested I make coffee this morning, and it sounded like a great idea to me. I had filched a little packet of creamer so that I could have a nice creamy coffee. It tasted great. I love a day that starts with a hot coffee. Since it had stopped raining I could sit on a rock by the fire ring and enjoy a mug. I was wearing my daytime shirt on the outside of my fleece so my body heat could dry it out. I had no such option for my pants, sadly. 
Neon, Andante and I solved some of the world's problems as we walked down gentle trail until reaching Fitzgerald Falls. Then Neon charged up the hill, as she does. We planned to meet at the top, but I didn't see her again for hours. She had stepped into the woods at some point and I bypassed her. She waited for me, I waited for her (in different places) and the twain did not meet until after lunch. I checked my phone but saw no message. (One eventually arrived at dinner time.) I was asking strangers about seeing her by the time she caught me. 
We walked together the rest of the afternoon, climbing up the very steep climbs this section is known for. We had planned a short day since I knew it would be tough. At four pm my legs gave notice that they were done. I knew I could continue, but at a cost. I estimate I was at about 85% Mrs Joy standard energy today and it would be easy to overdo and set myself back. 
Neon didn't argue too much about stopping early. The climbs were strenuous for her too - and we both knew we wanted to avoid the bear at Fingerboard shelter. 
We are camped in a pretty little site with a cluster of pink ladyslippers near us. I'm under a big pine tree, and both of us are on beds of moss. I hope for another good night of sleep to bring me back to normal. 
I figure I slept about twelve hours last night and it felt like just about enough. Those days of hiking in the heat last week really took it out of me. Combined with my brief illness and the tough hiking, it's very noticeable to me that my energy level hasn't been up to par. I don't feel the dragging fatigue tonight though. Just tired legs.

My legs hurt so much when I got in bed that I couldn't sleep. I lay there, watching the color drain out of the world, until it got dark out. Sleep wouldn't come. I stared at the pattern in the fabric of my tent and let my mind clear. Eventually I remembered the existence of muscle relaxers and took one. It was a long time before I found a position that didn't hurt. 
At the coldest hour of the night, just after four AM, I became aware that I was chilly. Eventually I found the gumption to put on my fleece top, which was right next to me. Then I was warm enough but also awake enough to notice that I needed to pee. I got up and did that, then couldn't fall asleep again afterwards. Of course. 
Neon got our food down out of the trees we had used. No appropriate branches were available last night so I strung the rope through the crotches of two trees. It's a little more work then just throwing the rope over a branch, but if no branch is available, it's a good alternative. 
It seemed like it might rain, so Neon told me to get going after I inhaled my breakfast. Her oatmeal is lighter but takes longer to cook and eat. 
I headed up the mountain feeling pretty good. My outer thigh abductors are sore from yesterday, but not too bad. My energy levels are pretty much back to normal now. And of course I'm ravenous. And I smell bad. 
Agony Grind wasn't too bad. We dashed across the road and headed into Harriman State Park. I was happy to introduce another friend to the loveliness there. It's just so unrealistically pretty. There were climbs but the trail there is significantly easier in grade and footing than our last few days have been. It felt like I was saying hello to old friends as I passed some of the more spectacular and memorable features of the park. We both squeezed through the Lemon Squeezer, not even needing to take off our packs. The afternoon passed prettily through stunning scene after stunning scene. 
Andante caught up with us at lunch time and we played leapfrog a bit. After I passed him, I came upon a bear who was right on the trail. I was still about two hundred feet away so I watched for a bit, then walked back to Andante and said ""Bear"". We walked up the trail together, in time to see the bear casually strolling off. I kept my eyes open but didn't see another. However the shelter we are tenting near tonight has had recent reported bear visits. I hung my food PCT style and insisted we all hang our food separately so if the bear got one line down, he wouldn't get everything. I don't understand why shelters in a bear intensive area don't have any kind of bear-proof food storage. I hope my bear bagging does the job. If not.. well, it will be a hungry walk into town tomorrow. 
The woods here are open and you can see a long way. It's beautiful, but it sure does make it hard to find a place to have a private moment.","Arden mountain

Yesterday we called around and finally found a room for the night in Peekskill, so it wasn't too devastating to wake up to rain on the tent this morning. I knew I would be clean and warm and dry at the end of the day. It was actually a cozy feeling to wake up knowing that I and all my gear were dry. 
I pulled on my hiking clothes, packed up everything, and got out to collapse my soggy tent and pack it up. That's a filthy job. Every blasted thing sticks to the tent when it's wet. 
I retrieved my food from its PCT hang and went up to the shelter to heat water for coffee. I'm low on fuel - only one or two more coffees worth at best. I was out of pop tarts so I ate my Ding Dongs for breakfast. They were quite filling actually. Not nutritious. But filling. Neon was out of oatmeal so I gave her a Luna bar for breakfast. 
And then we walked. It poured and we walked. The Palisades Parkway traffic was much thinner and less terrifying than the last time I had to cross it, for which I was grateful. 
Neon pulled ahead while I filtered water, and so I hove up to the next mountain solo. The wind picked up and the rain intensified. It felt epic to be climbing the mountain as the elements challenged me. I was getting wetter but the climbing kept me warm. I enjoyed it in a splashing through puddles sort of way. 
I ran into Andante at a road crossing and he slowed down so we could walk together. He always has interesting things to say. We talked about oil painting and old houses and asbestos and radiators and all sorts of things. We were still gabbing when I spotted Neon in the distance, standing and watching our approach. Now three, we continued up Bear Mountain. We were all completely soaked and I was getting cold. We skipped the summit and headed down the 1000 stairs. By the bottom my knees hated me. I was feeling pretty bad until we finally dropped below the clouds and the temperature climbed. Then all was well again. 
At the base of the mountain we headed for the Bear Mountain Inn, where they graciously let our sodden selves into the dining room. I was pretty hungry. It was lunch time, and except to filter water I hadn't stopped moving in hours. I had two beers, two cups of coffee, an enormous cheeseburger, an even more enormous pile of fries, peach cobbler, and some of Neon's dessert. Honestly I could have eaten more. I'm hungry now come to think of it. 
We called a cab to get to the motel. He came right away and we were at the motel in a snap. We've all three showered and we're washing clothes and generally drying out. It's supposed to be a pretty wet week so we need to make some plans for surviving with relative equanimity. I think I might be looking for a higher than average number of motel stays. I can hike wet in the day if I know I can be warm and dry at night. Multiple nights in a wet tent tends to cause discontented yowling.","William Brien shelter

I was so happy to be in a real bed last night. A soft, warm, dry bed. Andante and Neon and I stayed up late talking, so we didn't bounce out of bed at the crack of dawn. I staggered to the bathroom first, then climbed back into bed. But my brain had already engaged, so I soon gave up and got up to dress. 
Andante and Neon were a little slower. I left them to it and went down to breakfast, where the room was quickly filling. I toasted a bagel and grabbed a cheese omelet and a slice of ham from the warmer. I combined them into a tasty breakfast sandwich. Coffee, orange juice, apple juice, an orange, and more coffee later, I was done. Then I grabbed cereal and soy milk to eat in the room. 
Andante noticed some folks looking for a place to sit and invited them to our table. They were the proud grandparents of a graduating West Point student. Cadet? I don't know but they were pretty jazzed up. The grandson was one of the football players, and had been asked to stay on for a few months to coach the team. I would have been proud too. 
Our taxi from last night came to take us back to Bear Mountain. He dropped us at the Fort Montgomery PO where Andante had a mail drop. Neon and I resupplied at the Chestnut Mart, then I walked back to Bear Mountain to the PO there. It was, no lie, behind the maintenance shed. I had to ask somebody where to find it. Phoenix Rising had sent me a box full of goodies. I started in right away on the homemade cookies - pretzel caramel chocolate chip. Oh my goodness. So good. 
After walking around all morning I was relieved to finally get underway around 11. First I had to go through the zoo (which had the fattest bear I've seen in my life) and cross the big suspension bridge. And then walk down the road approximately forever. Finally I set foot on dirt again. My feet breathed a tiny sigh as the punishment of slapping concrete ended. 
I caught up with Andante and Neon on top of the mountain where they had found a sunny spot to sit and wait. We walked together for a time, then Neon charged ahead. I walked with Andante until he said I should go ahead too. Our cab ride had triggered an attack of dizziness and he was really suffering. I couldn't think of anything helpful so I left him to his slow progress. 
I found Neon eating outside the Appalachian Mart. Not sure why it isn't in the AWOL guide anymore, but it's still there and would have made a far better resupply for us.  I got food to eat there - an enormous slice of pizza, a pig in a blanket, some pringles, a coke, a pint of Ben and Jerry's, and a seltzer. After all that, dinner was a moot point. 
We walked the .6 to the monastery/spiritual life center and called it a day. It was our second short day in a row. I am feeling refreshed by the lower mileage. I can't do seven mile days indefinitely but a few of them are all right. And forward progress is still progress. 
The monastery grounds are lovely and the camping setup is very nice. There is a covered pavilion with picnic tables, electricity, running water, portapotties, and nice flat grassy spots for tenting. We put up our tents to dry them out from yesterday. Then we lolled about in the sunshine, enjoying the sensation of doing not very much.","Bear Mountain

Today wasn't very long compared to an average day on this hike, but it was long compared to yesterday. Oof. Lots of folks out hiking, unsurprisingly. It was very pretty weather most of the day. Clear blue skies and about 70 degrees. 
I woke up to a tent soaked in dew. I wiped it down as best I could with my camp towel, then got up and made coffee. Neon and I sat companionably in the pavilion as we ate our breakfasts. I'm trying to eat the heaviest things first, of course. Today it was a honeybun. My thruhiker eating powers are in full operation. Generally speaking I can eat double servings of anything, any time. I definitely used up all my snacks today, and really would have liked more for the last hour of hiking. When we camped, I was finally in the mood for the polenta and Italian sausage meal from Packit Gourmet that I've been carrying since Delaware Water Gap. I suspect I need to start planning for more filling dinners. I was full after this one but an hour later I would be happy to eat again. 
I thought I remembered the terrain for today pretty well, but I definitely didn't.  Basically two little bits had stuck in my mind back in 2010. A region with a lot of stone walls, and a level area on built up stone walls. But there was a whole lot of climbing up and down ridges that apparently escaped my notice last time. Also I'm not sure if I blundered into a swamp and had to fumble my way over a guard rail in 2010.","Graymoor Monastery

I slept well in our stealth site, but as soon as I left my tent in the morning, mosquitoes attacked. Neon said she was still tired from yesterday and was going to be slow getting up, and I should go ahead. I took her up on it. 
The morning's hike was pretty and fairly easy - a nice change of pace from southern NY. I rolled into RPH shelter around 10:30. Time for a snack break! I devoured mass quantities while I waited for Neon. 
She arrived minutes later with the announcement that she had decided, for various reasons, to get shuttled back to her car today. I gave her a big hug and continued on my way, accompanied by the usual sadness of parting. She's such good company. But she has a real life that needs tending to on occasion. 
I hit my next shelter after 14 easy miles and set up in the shelter since rain was predicted. Only one other hiker stayed in the shelter - Dan, on his first section. I welcomed him to our tribe. 
Terrence, Patty and her family, and assorted others tented nearby. Terrence, Dan and I stayed up late talking about a wide range of topics. All of a sudden I realized I had been talking a LOT and stopped, embarrassed. And then we pretty much all turned in.","Clarence Fahnestock state park

I woke up early, ate a Luna bar, and was underway before 7. The trail was nice and the predicted rain was barely a drizzle. But that all changed about 10 AM. The rain turned cold and hard, the wind rose, and I got soaked and chilled despite rain gear and exercise. 
I had already planned to take a break at the first shelter, so I pulled up there at eleven, put on my fleece top, and made a hot cider. And then a cup of soup. I was marginally warmer, but not comfortable. I weighed my options and decided to stay. It continued to pour while I sat under cover, willing my clothes to dry by body heat. 
My shirt eventually dried but the seat of my pants never really did. The reinforcements on the seat tend to stay damp, apparently. I gave up at 7:30 and swapped my hiking pants for my silk long underwear for sleeping. 
Hikers came and went during the day. Terrence and Purge stayed a while to warm up, then left. Redmage decided to stay. He set up his hammock behind the shelter, then we hung out while he cooked his dinner. 
There is a small lending library here. I grabbed an Orson Scott Card novel but had a hard time reading in the dimness of the shelter. I think I'll take it with me. I think I somehow missed reading it when it came out, and I'll need something to do on the day off I've promised myself soon. 
Tomorrow I'll get the mail drop I was going to pick up today, and hike closer to Kent. I'd been thinking of a nearo and a zero so I could effectively have two days off, but the mileage won't work out well for that. Tomorrow when I'm certain what day I'll get to town, I'll call around to see where I can find a room. Kent is officially in New England and therefore it will be expensive.","Morgan Stewart shelter

I slept very well in the empty shelter. With nobody to worry about waking, but the knowledge of Redmage nearby in his hammock making me feel safe, it was the best of both worlds. I awoke early to the sound of rain. I was comfy and warm, so I rolled over and went back to sleep. I did this once more before struggling back to consciousness at six. I had to pee. I think this is the reason most people have to get out of bed eventually. 
I didn't have much food left, nor much fuel. I ate a snickers bar and some water with caffeinated drink mix. That didn't take long. I started walking still warmly dressed. The shelter was in a cloud, hence dripping and cold. Once I lost some elevation and dropped below the cloud, I warmed quickly. 
The trail was slick and muddy. I had to sit and slide down a rock, soaking my recently dried pants. Grump. But the walk was pretty, with lots of bridges and bog boards. The walk through the swamp was dramatically different from 2010, with a really pretty boardwalk replacing submerged bog boards. 
At the road I turned east and walked down to Tony's Deli. They made me a fantastic breakfast sandwich full of bacon done just right. I bought a bottle of Heet for cooking, a soda, a burger to go, and some gummy peaches. It's a great stop. I would definitely go there again. Also I saw a 1976 thruhiker I had met on the boardwalk, which was neat. 
Back at the trail, I stopped in at the garden center to get my maildrop. They have had problems with hikers taking advantage of them, and my reception was lukewarm. But they had my maildrop and  I was able to unpack it in a gazebo and recycle the box there. Good enough for me. 
Returning to my hike, I walked by cows who were not impressed by me, and into the Pawling Nature Reserve. It had a very Lord of the Rings look, like it had been specially crafted to be attractive. I pictured dramatic things happening in the woods around me while I sat and ate my lunch burger. Just as I finished, Cocoa walked by. It was nice to see him!
After lunch I continued to Wiley Shelter where I talked a few minutes with Cocoa, then moved on. The four miles to Ten Mile River shelter went quickly. I stopped high on a hill to call a B&B near Kent to make a reservation. Zero day! Once I finish walking there I mean. 
At the shelter are Old Growth who I met last night, Happy, Bad Moon, and Andante! It's nice to see him again.  With my zero I expect we'll play leapfrog again, but on a larger scale.","Telephone Pioneers shelter

I woke with the sun, of course. The other three hikers stayed snuggled in their bags as I got up to visit the privy, change clothes, and get my food bag from the bear box. I ate breakfast outside the shelter to minimize noise. But I had to climb back in and make noise to pack up my overnight gear. Sorry guys! Two out of three were blearily awake as I walked away. 
The day alternated between clouds and downpours. I started hankering for a rain cape that would be easier to use than my raincoat. Lightheart Gear sells one that I'm thinking about ordering. Maybe when my current gear wears out. I would still need a raincoat at times, but sometimes you just want something over your head and shoulders. 
The rain made everything slippery, including the rocks. The big rocks I had to get over to get to town. I slid, I fell, I tripped, and I took a long time to get anywhere. But finally, finally, I got to the road to Kent. I walked into town straight away, heading first for the ATM and then for the laundry. They were out of all soap, so I was forced to approach a teenager doing his laundry to ask if I could buy some detergent from him. He refused the money and let me use it. I thanked him profusely. The town of Kent should thank him too. Stinky hikers are bad for business. 
While my clothes washed, I wore my windbreaker and rain skirt. I decided to get takeout Chinese to eat on the laundry's porch. After a short wait I had an egg roll, ginger ale, and chicken in something. As I walked out of the Chinese place, I tripped on the curb and went down hard in the parking lot. I had gravel embedded in my left calf, and later I found road rash on my back as well as small holes in my windbreaker. What a bummer. This fall shook me up way more than my trail falls, which usually don't leave a mark. I was still shaking as I started eating my food, which luckily survived the fall. 
Once my clothes dried, I changed out of my rain and wind gear and called the B&B to come get me. The checkin was hassle free. Within moments I was showering. You know those grippy shower mats? I managed to loosen this one, nearly falling in the shower. Gravity and I had issues today. 
Back in my room, I started recharging my electronics and using Facebook while I lay on the bed. When I checked weather, I noticed a tornado warning. It had apparently just hit Pawling. I headed downstairs and alerted the B&B owners. I hung out on the lower level until the danger passed. 
Tomorrow I'm excited to meet Chris and Frannie for dinner.  I haven't seen them in three years, since we all spent an evening at Fingerboard shelter before Chris hiked north and I hiked south. They're fun people. It should be a great evening.","Ten Mile River Shelter

I woke up at four. And five. And six. I don't know what my body was thinking. Now that I d gotten up and had breakfast, it wants a nap. Sounds good to me. I need to buy a little stuff in town today, but mostly today is a day of rest. 
I sorted out my food to figure out what to buy, then at 11 went down to ask Mary for a ride. I was planning to stay through dinner time but Mary said she wouldn't mind ferrying me back and forth, so I had options. She dropped me off at the Villager. I had a big second breakfast, then moseyed over to the outfitter. They didn't have much I wanted, but they did have ice cream. I got a cone with a scoop of ginger ice cream. So good!
Walking back toward the grocery, I stopped in at Kent Wine and Spirits for scotch. The 375 milligram size was perfect. It would fit in a soda bottle with room to spare. 
I continued to the grocery to buy minimal groceries. Cheese, tortillas, Luna bars, some cookies, some gorp. And then I had exhausted my Kent plans. I called Mary for a ride. Elapsed time: 1:30. 
Back at the b&b, I sorted and packed things and generally lay on the bed being slothful. At five Cooper drove me back to town where Chris and Frannie had driven up to meet me for dinner. I still find both of them to be a delight. We had a great meal and fun conversation. After hugging them goodbye, it was back to the ranch time.

You know what I like in a campsite? Pine needles and an eastern exposure so I get to see the dawn. Water is a bonus. Silver hill has all that plus a dining pavilion and trees with good branches for hanging food bags. Cocoa being here was a bonus. (The hiker, not the beverage.) Also Swan rolled in. I had seen her in the registers but not met her before. She is a grade A badass flip flopper based on my first impression. 
This morning I dillydallyed until it was seven and I could go down to breakfast. My appetite was on vacation so I just had melon and an English muffin. Cooper was on a conspiracy theory tear, so we had a friendly argument ranging from quantum mechanics to the moon landing to the presence of life on exoplanets. 
The day's hike started steeply uphill, as it always does after a resupply. It was so so pretty up on the ridge. I was braced for going down St John's ledges but it was still fairly grueling. At least I didn't ram my kneecap into a rock like in 2010. On the way down I listened to a podcast on Copernicus - birth name Nikolai Kopernik. Polish scientists represent!
In the afternoon there was a several mile flat walk along the Housatonic river, which was pleasant. I stopped for lunch at Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter, where the privy was so full that the feces are riding up into the stool. I left my opinion that it's time for people to dig holes until the privy is dealt with. 
Clouds loomed ominously in the afternoon and I put on the pack cover and kept my rain gear handy, but nothing came of it. About four I arrived at this campsite, which I've wanted to stay at since I first eyeballed it I. 2010. It was a little early to stop, but I have a great appreciation for natural beauty and didn't want to miss my chance to spend some time here. 
Cocoa called about rooms in Salisbury and one place is full and the other didn't answer. Looks like I might have to resupply, skip showering, and move on. That would be okay by me I guess. The market there is nice at any rate. And sooner or later I'll be in Laurie's vicinity and I'm certain she'll let me shower. In fact she might request it. 
I ate dinner tonight in the pavilion with Cocoa. It was less of a struggle to finish my polenta with sausage dinner than it was last time. And I added spinach this time. I figure this means I'm nutritionally balanced now that I ate a vegetable. I'm carrying a variety of dried fruits, too. Last time I ate almost everything except the dried spinach and dried kimchi. So even though my food bag continues to be twice the size of other people's, I guess I'm good with it. 
It's supposed to be about 42 tonight. That's near the limit of my 40 degree bag. Wish me luck that I stay warm.","Kent

It happened again. Somebody asked my name. I said Mrs Joy. Then they asked if I had a trailname. My trailname is not the best one ever, that's for sure. I mean, it's better than some. I don't want to be called Skidmark or Bear Bait. But it really doesn't sound like a trailname. 
Anyway. 
I was going to get an early start but I turned over and pulled my hat back over my eyes when the sun came up. Then I made coffee. The making and the drinking take a while. Then I talked to Swan a bit. It was eight before I started walking. 
The terrain was not dramatic today, but it was pretty in a quiet way that I like very much. There were excellent small waterfalls. Big stone walls. Sunlight sparkling down through green leaves. Pine groves. It was nice. 
It rained for an hour in the morning, then cleared up again. It never got hard enough to put my raincoat on, though I kept it draped over my shoulders. The temperature was pleasant and the rain did not impede my walk. 
Section hikers told me that it was supposed to thunderstorm on Monday. I let their anxiety infect me. I worried about what I would do. But when I got to camp tonight I realized that it made little difference to me. I'd stay in town, or in a shelter, or just walk. It isn't complicated. 
Oddly, hostels seem to be booked. I'm seeing the same few hikers in town and on the trail so I have no idea who is filling the space. I just did laundry and showered so I'm not feeling very motivated to get to go to one, but it seems odd to me. Tomorrow I'll likely get some groceries in Salisbury and then move on, as I doubt I'll find a room in town. I'm debating going to Toymaker's Cafe in Falls Village. I wouldn't mind a town meal but it will take up time, meaning I'll spend more time walking in the rain in the evening. Might be worth it though. 
I'm not sure why but it seems like I'm going a little slower now. The terrain is relatively easy. Odd. I'm in no great rush, though. There's time. I have no plans requiring me to be anywhere by a specific date this summer.","Silver Hill Campsite

The tent I thought was Cocoa's last night was actually Swan's. I have no idea where Cocoa is. Maria didn't get his message so he never got confirmation that he could stay here. I told her I'd split the room if he showed up, but it seems less likely all the time.  I hope he is somewhere warm and dry. 
I got up at 5 and was walking by 6. I slept terribly last night. As soon as I lay down, my nose stuffed up completely. I must have been allergic to something at the site.  Or maybe I'm allergic to the damp foulness forming in the bottom of my pack. Either way, it was awful. I snorfled and breathed through my mouth for a while. I took some benadryl and eventually my nose cleared. I felt bad about the snorfling, which must have been audible to the fellow next to me. 
I declined to use the privy this morning, as it had no walls. It was a seat height wooden box with a toilet seat and a short back. That was it. 
On my way out I talked briefly with Andante. He wanted to get breakfast in Falls Village. I wanted to make tracks for Salisbury, not knowing if I could stay the night or would need to move on to Riga shelter. But on the way I started hankering for breakfast and a coke. And a bathroom with walls. When I got to Falls Village I headed up to the Toymaker's Cafe and got a ""Big Easy"" - basically an eggs Benedict, but made with a bagel and Tasso ham. It was amazing. I surprised myself by finishing almost all of it. Andante came in and scolded me a little for changing my mind. He got a less substantial breakfast. I went back for a second coke. 
Leaving there I plunged back onto the trail and went as fast as I could. I reached town about one or one thirty. I had called Maria McCabe from the mountain so I knew I had a refuge. A hiker got his wife/chauffeur to drop me off at her place, saving me some road walking. 
After a shower and borrowing a little hiker wear from Maria, I visited the Country Bistro, which still has fabulous food. Then I went by LaBonne's Market for supplies. If the weather shifts I'll abort my plan for a zero and get moving again. I can be ready to go in minutes.

I awoke from luxurious sleep. The mattress had memory foam or something in it. It was pretty warm to sleep on, but my goodness it was comfortable. I wanted to roll it up and take it with me. 
I checked the weather and saw that the predicted thunderstorms would be delayed until the afternoon, but after they started it would rain for days. I decided to pack up and go. It made no sense to spend the small amount of rain free time in town when I knew it would rain tomorrow. 
I packed my gear then headed downstairs. I had not been social last night so I didn't know that Maria slept in until 9. But Highlander and Wade knew the scoop. We made a companionable breakfast together. Wade scrambled eggs, I toasted bread, and Highlander heated water for coffee and poured juice. I took my many pills and added half an Imitrex for the migraine blossoming behind my left temple. 
Leaving early meant sacrificing my second day's payment to Maria, but I didn't want to wait around for a refund. Ah well. The bed *was* really comfortable. I've paid far more for far worse sleep. 
I walked down the road to the cemetery. I decided that walking through it would be safer and more pleasant than the highway, and I could pick up the AT on the other side. I was right. It was very pleasant. 
When I got to the base of the first mountain, my legs protested. They burned. I wondered why I felt so tired. But I moved slowly up the mountain, stopping often. A trail runner stopped to tell me how proud of me he was for thruhiking. He seemed to feel fatherly about it, and I took his words in gratefully. Soon Highlander and Wade passed me, and then Mona Lisa and another hiker whose name I should have written down. In the distance I heard a large group of children. I can't imagine what possessed the adults to take these kids hiking on this cool, foggy day with severe weather looming. The kids were being typical oblivious kids, and I had to ask repeatedly to get by as they stood blocking the trail while in their own little worlds. 
Finally reaching the summit, I descended down steep, slippery rocks, frequently sliding down on my butt.  At the second shelter I stopped for lunch and found Highlander and Wade. I told them to hold me a spot at Hemlocks, then reconsidered and said I'd camp if I got tired. They left as I was getting food out. 
I started feeling more energized and realized that the Imitrex had probably caused my morning fatigue. It's treacherous stuff. It works wonders on migraines, but the side effects are problematic. Fortunately my headache stayed small, and I enjoyed the strength surging back into my legs as the drug wore off. 
Sage's Ravine was a delight, with waterfalls and mossy boulders being tremendously scenic. I crossed the stream and headed up Race Mountain. As I climbed higher it got colder and darker. I observed goosebumps on my arms, so I rolled down my sleeves and pulled on my raincoat. I immediately felt warmer as the coat held warmth in, and I could focus more on my surroundings. The fog was so thick that it looked like a white wall at the edge of the mountain. The wind blew harder and I kept away from the edge as I staggered. The trail was exposed for half a mile. It was a thrilling experience to be up there in that weather. Not truly dangerous, but invigorating. Nonetheless I was glad when the trail dropped down into the trees. It was hours until sunset but it had gotten very dark. I knew the rain was finally approaching. 
I reached the Racebrook Falls trail and the base of Mt Everett at 5. I chose to leave that steep mountain for the morning and headed down the side trail to the campsite there. It would have been nice to have company, and keep my gear more dry, but not nice enough to deal with that mountain just then. 
Unsurprisingly, I was the only camper at the site. There was a bear box, which was nice! No need to hang my food. There was also a nice privy, with some toilet paper, even.  And some very nice tent platforms which I couldn't use with this tent. I set up my tent in a flat spot which would undoubtedly flood when it rained. 
Then I realized I hadn't seen water. I put my food in the bearbox, put everything else in the tent, and consulted my map. Water showed a little way further down the trail, so I picked up my pole and headed down. I found the water and then hiked back up the hill in drizzle. I retrieved my food and ate a quick dinner as the rain picked up, them stowed the bag again and climbed into the tent to get organized. 
A check of the phone showed surprisingly good cell coverage, so I spent some time texting my husband as the rain continued to get harder. 
I know I'll have to do everything in the rain in the morning. I'm already horribly aware how dry the privy is inside, and how disgusting it would be to eat breakfast in it, but I confess that it's tempting. I'll probably eat in the tent, which isn't a great idea in bear territory. But I strongly doubt that bears will be visiting this spot in the torrent at breakfast time. I haven't  seen a bear in a hundred miles, anyway. 
Tomorrow I'll probably spend the night in Great Barrington. It's only ten miles away, but it will seem pretty appealing after a day hiking in rain. And I think I'll need to get a little more food to get me to Dalton, and Laurie. Probably ought to re-evaluate before I buy anything, though.. I've been dining on town meals and my supplies haven't diminished much.","Salisbury, CT

Thunder rumbled. The rain increased in volume until it was physically slapping the tent. The site did indeed flood. My tent floor proved to be only semi-waterproof. It was wet to the touch underneath my sleeping pad but the water level inside the tent didn't rise. Not sure it would stay that way, I shoved nearly everything not involved with sleeping back into the backpack. I set the pack up on top of my crocs so it wouldn't be sitting in a puddle. 
With particularly vigorous volleys I could feel condensation splattering onto my face from the ceiling of the tent. Not restful. Not great for my down bag. I tried putting my rain skirt over the foot of my bag and my raincoat over the rest. Oddly, since the skirt is not breathable but the raincoat is, the skirt seemed to work better than the jacket. I would have thought the bag would get have gotten damp under the skirt from my body moisture, but it was only getting damp under the jacket. I removed the jacket and counted on my body heat to keep the bag dry despite spatters. 
Eventually the storm died down, and I could sleep well. I slept until an astonishing 8:30 - twelve hours in the sack. I'm assuming the first few restless hours didn't really count. 
I decided it was a good morning for coffee. My stove chose today to be finicky but eventually I had hot water. I ate all of the blueberry strudel that I had intended to be two to three breakfasts. Mmm, strudel. No big problem as I was walking into another town today. 
By the time I stuffed my wet, filthy tent (the screening being coated with mud and leaves thanks to the storm) and hiked back up the side trail, it was ten AM. Talk about your late starts. But I knew I was only going about ten miles so I didn't fret. 
Despite the adventures with condensation and the filthy tent, I'm glad I stopped where I did last night. It took me two hours to get over the mountain between me and the next shelter this morning. After a night's sleep, in good light, with no rain. Doing it last night probably would have put me at the shelter at eight, soaked and exhausted. And maybe a little battered. I don't think I would have liked being up there in a storm. 
The rain today held off until immediately after I descended from Jug End. Excellent timing. I was still bedraggled by the time I got to the road into town, but it was far better and safer to walk in the rain on dirt trail than on steep rocks. 
I started walking into town without trying to hitch, figuring that nobody would want my wet, muddy self in their vehicle. So I was surprised when somebody pulled over and hollered to ask if I wanted a ride. He had attempted a thruhike a few years ago, which explains his willingness to let a soaking wet stranger into his vehicle. He ferried me to the Days Inn. I thanked him sincerely for the trail magic. 
This is a really brief stop for me. I went to Manhattan Pizza for dinner, where Old Growth was at the next table.  We talked a little after our meals. I said I was going to carry out my leftovers to the trail. ""Yes, you have two pieces. But let's be honest, they won't make it past ten PM. "" said Old Growth. I had to laugh. As it happens, I think the pizza will survive until morning, but may not make it out of town. 
Returning to the environs of the Days Inn, I picked up some supplies at CVS and I think that will do me. Well, that and a hot shower and a soft bed.","Racebrook Falls Campsite

Today was just spectacular. Blue skies and fluffy blue clouds dominated. Rays of sunshine illuminated the forest, drawing my attention to their endpoints - individual rocks lit up like objects in a painting by one of the old masters. 
This morning I had breakfast in bed - leftovers from last night's pizza. It was still wonderful. Forewarned by Old Growth, I knew that the motel breakfast was awful, but I still walked down at seven to check. It was pretty bad. I had a bowl of Frosted Flakes, a cup of coffee, and an apple juicebox. There were ""omelets"" in the little fridge that looked like dried up sponges. No thanks. 
I called a cab to get back to the trail. $14 later I stepped on the soggy AT. In the flatlands there was standing water. I had soggy socks for a while as there was no way around it. 
I sat on a rock for lunch and was swarmed by mosquitoes. The one downside to today was the bugs, invigorated by the wet weather and warmer temperatures. I covered my legs with my raincoat to keep them from biting through my pants, and wore my windbreaker with my hood up. 
After lunch I stopped in at Tom Leonard Shelter and ran into Highlander and Wade. They were going on to south Wilcox. I figured they were my only chance for company as I had seen zero other hikers for some time. But tonight Redmage showed up while I was making dinner, then four more nobos I hadn't met before. And somewhere between six and eight men that looked like section hikers just rolled in around 8 pm. 
I'm tented tonight, both to air out my tent and to keep away from the bugs. The tent was still soaked from the storm two nights ago. I set it up then left it empty while I made dinner. It was still on the wet side after that so I wiped down the insides. I was able to knock off much of the dirt that had adhered to the mesh, for which I am glad. The dirt didn't enhance the structure. I turned the pack liner and tent stuff sacks inside out and hung them up to dry. My pack is attached to a tree, hanging open as well. It's about all I can do until I can get my hands on some destinking agents. 
Let's see, other highlights. A friendly, cuddly four month old golden retriever pup who had the softest fur and the best personality. I wanted to take him with me. His two human companions got me to take a picture of the three of them. 
The terrain after Tom Leonard shelter was stunning - pine needle covered slopes along a ravine so narrow I almost felt like I could reach out and touch the other side. Then back uphill through a young dense forest, past a pond that required me to stop and take a picture. I took a lot of pictures today. Today was one of those perfect hiking days for me. 
It occurs to me that Upper Goose Pond tomorrow will be crowded, given how many people are here tonight. Ah well. 
My feet have toughened up enough to not need any bandaging, by the way. This does not mean I won't get a blister tomorrow, of course. But it's nice right now.","Great Barrington

I awoke damp and cold and irritable. Apparently at some point during the night I sweated, and it was humid enough that my clothes didn't dry again. My skin was still warm to the touch, but I felt distinctly chilly. As I awoke a little more I remembered the long day ahead of me and started packing up. My breakfast was a quick poptarts and caffeinated drink mix. I was on the trail by 6:30. 
I noticed when I awoke that the tent that was set up next to me late last night was already gone. I don't know if they left at midnight or what. All the long distance hikers agreed that it was weird. 
I hiked for a time with Reddmage. He had interesting things to say about metallurgy, and we nattered on about that for a while.  My interest in the conversation kept me drafting behind him for a while, but his 1500 miles worth of trail legs definitely trumped my 500 miles. I got tired and dropped back. 
I ran into trail angel Teacher today. She said she was planning on moving north with the crowd so I'll likely see her again. I also met Reddmage's friends Grumpy and Gucci Girl, who wanted to bring Reddmage some trail magic. I told them about my Shocktop/ French fries fantasy, and they almost made it happen. They actually bought them, but Gucci Girl didn't feel so hot hauling the heavy pack down the trail, as she was also carrying a bunch of fresh fruit. Ah well. The thought definitely counted with me. 
Today was pretty long, with minimal other options. My feet bones and their associated ligaments ache. My options for tomorrow are awkward. 8.8 or 17.something miles. I may have to reread my old journal to try to recall what the terrain is like. I don't remember it at all. The profile looks nice, but it could be all rocks or something. 
Oh, around midday today I ran into a charming AT Trail Stand. A couple of farm kids turned a small shed into an honor system farm stand type building. I bought a soda and a bag of Fritos and was happy to have them. I sat at the nearby picnic table with Coyote, Cheese, and a couple of others. I'm slowly learning names. Although they'll likely bypass me in a few days, so those names may be wasted brain space. 
Cocoa is tenting here tonight. I was glad to see him and know he was okay.  Come to think of it I should probably try getting contact information for him and some others I see kind of regularly. This is not something I'm good at. But if I'd had his number I could have just texted him to see if he was all right, rather than wonder for several days.","Mt Wilcox South Shelters

Long day. Long, long day. Over eighteen miles if you add the half mile trail from the cabin back to the AT. 
I slept well in the bunk, barring a midnight trip to the woods. I woke up at first light and changed into my salty hiking clothes. I wouldn't have minded sleeping but I knew I needed all my hiking time today. Downstairs the caretaker offered my coffee and pancakes, which tasted heavenly. I filtered a little more water and was underway by 6:30. 
Two miles in we found the cache that Gucci Girl had left. I had cherries (OMG) and chugged a coke. Thus fueled I buzzed up the first mountain. 
I didn't pay much attention to scenery today. I watched my footing and I moved. At the first shelter, halfway, I ate quickly and taped my feet. My arches are feeling the strain of the back to back long days. 
I spent a little time coordinating my stop in Dalton. I'm super excited to see both friends and family. I'll stay with Laurie, and my brother and family will drive out to meet us for a meal on Sunday. I don't see any of them often so this is a big treat for me. 
This afternoon I also put my head down and walked, stopping to get water and a couple of cookies from the cookie lady. I didn't get a chance to meet her in 2010 so I was pleased to do so today.

Amazingly, I neither fell out of bed nor crushed any hapless sleepers getting in or out of my upper bunk last night. There was a lone mosquito who harassed me and for all I know bit me while I slept, but I slept pretty well. I restrained myself from murdering the people who were loudly practicing card tricks at the picnic table in front of the shelter and was rewarded when they eventually, nonviolently shut the hell up and let me sleep. 
I may or may not have crinkled everything in their direction when I packed up this morning. 
My hike was uneventful with the exception of a slippery muddy section about half a mile long. I stayed upright, but only just barely. I caked more mud onto my shoes and pants, but at this point it would be hard to tell the difference after it dried. My pants are a panoply of mud layers from Connecticut to Massachusetts. I bet geology students would love them. 
Laurie and Beth showed up at four minutes to nine, shortly after I got to our planned meeting point. We had an excited girly squealy hug and then I dove into the car to get away from the voracious mosquitoes. Laurie drive to the Creamery where she also had taken me on my last thru. I got a toasted everything bagel with lox, cream cheese, onions, tomato, and capers. As usual the capers continually rolled off and pachinkoed their way down onto my plate. Still, that was a damn fine bagel. 
At Laurie's I started laundry and a shower. Laurie and Ray went off to an equestrian event while I napped and did laundry. Mostly I napped. Whenever the machines made a significant sound I got up and took appropriate action. When the dryer finally sounded, I collected my armful of warm, good smelling laundry and didn't want to let it go. So I took it back to the bed and slept cuddled around it. Honestly warm laundry is a pretty good bed partner. I have no complaints. 
In the evening we drove out to the Blind Pig in Athol for extremely tasty food and beer. I got a beer flight before deciding on a blueberry beer to have in a full sized glass. My roast beef sandwich was literally finger licking good. Once I had demolished everything, we headed back to their house. 
I finally pulled the trigger on ordering a new backpack. My old one is worn out. It still holds contents, mostly, but it is abraded and frayed and torn, and I was nearing the lower limits of the hipbelt. The new pack will have a replaceable hip belt. I don't think that I will probably need to get an even smaller hip belt, but if my iliac crest somehow shrinks, I will be able to address the problem. At least from the backpack perspective. 
Tomorrow we're meeting some of my family for brunch and I'm so happy to see them! We don't live very close to each other and I don't get to see them enough. Plus my brother has never observed me with hiker hunger so that should be fun.","Kay Wood Shelter

I slept comfortably and awoke around six. Ray heated me up some of last night's coffee to help my brain start. Laurie toasted some bread and put out a variety of toppings. I chose lemon curd, which is essentially delicious yellow crack. Mmm, curd. 
We trooped out to Crimson Acres to check on Nicky, their mule. He is still adorable yet feisty. He didn't mind being groomed but when training got between him and his hay consumption, he displayed a little mule 'tude, swiftly corrected. It was a little reassuring to see him acting like a mule. He's generally way better behaved than any mule I've ever met. 
We returned to the house for a little break, then drove to the Gardner Ale House for brunch with Dan, Lynne, Sandy, and Logan. Brunch was delicious but too short. I just wanted to sit and feast my eyes on my family. But eventually they had to go live their lives, so we said goodbye. 
Laurie took a nap while Beth came to get me. She showed me her home, including parts we've discussed and many other amazing things that her husband has built. He has a gift for building beautiful structures. 
I also got thoroughly snuffled by her mare Breezy and fell in love a little. I love a horse who likes people. 
This evening we are having a quiet, relaxed time. I can't pack up until I change into my hiking clothes in the morning, so I'm free of chores for now. 
I'm looking forward to the next few days. Tomorrow Cheshire. Tuesday Mt Greylock. Wednesday Bennington. (In all likelihood. It doesn't pay to assume any plan will remain unchanged. ) Vermont is a great part of the trail - both pretty and relatively easy, at least in comparison to New Hampshire. It's not that I'm not looking forward to New Hampshire and Maine. It's just that I know that they will take all my strength, chunks of my skin, an uncomfortable amount of my fingernails, and likely the seat of my pants. Whereas Vermont is the sort of place where you can walk without a rope assist.","Dalton

I really didn't want to leave this morning. Ray and Laurie feel like family, and I truly enjoy spending time with them. But my little holiday had to end. Fish and guests start to stink after three days, after all. That goes double for malodorous thruhikers. And the trail isn't going to hike itself. 
Beth showed up at seven to drive me back to the trail. We stopped at the Old Creamery on the way where I bought myself a solid breakfast. It turned out to be a good thing, because it was so hot today that I didn't much feel like eating. I ended the day with most of my snacks uneaten, and I had not packed a lot of them. I drank my water and stopped three times to filter more. I added electrolytes, but I still ended the day with a headache. 
A highlight of today's hike was stopping in at Diane's Twist in Cheshire for a soft serve cone and a Gatorade. Together they were cold enough to give me brain freeze, and they left me feeling refreshed for about twenty minutes. I had planned to get a sandwich but knew that I wouldn't eat it in the heat, so I moved on instead. 
The last miles, up a steep mountainside of course, came hard. When I got to the shelter two sisters were cheerfully making dinner, and it was nice to absorb their positive attitudes. I got water immediately, hoping for a cold drink. The water flowed strongly but after the heat of the day it wasn't very cold. However it was better than running dry. 
I drank the water with drink mix added, and I forced myself to eat some. Not a full dinner, but some dried mango and the remains of a Greenbelly Bar. So far they remain palatable when my appetite is suppressed and I'm too tired to cook. Not even my salty snacks appealed. 
That kind of pisses me off because it means I have to keep carrying that food. 
I'm doing better than the guy who arrived after me, though, who I heard puking behind the shelter. I felt a pang of sympathy, thinking of my own episode on a hot day weeks ago. I took him his water to rinse out his mouth and collaborated to make sure he had enough water and some electrolytes. I hope he feels better in the morning. Hell, I hope *I* feel better in the morning.","Dalton

Poor fellow on the other bunk was up repeatedly to ralph, based on my occasional blurry nighttime sightings. I sincerely hope he feels better today. He was unsurprisingly tired today and was planning to recuperate at the shelter - though he intended to set up his tent to get away from the inevitable bugs. I suspect the heat wasn't fun either. I left him with more electrolytes and my leftover water. 
The hike up to Bascom Lodge was as pretty as I remembered, but less fragrant. It was very quiet - no cars, virtually no hikers. I arrived at the lodge at 9:30 and went directly to the cafe. I ordered pancakes with berries, which I didn't realize would be cooked in. Waste of raspberries. They should be eaten fresh or not at all.  Berry issues aside, I wasn't able to finish the plate. There were only three pancakes but each was about an inch thick and filled the plate. 
After this filling second breakfast, I walked out into another hot day. It was supposed to rain but never did. I was looking forward to the rain on this day, anticipating that it would help with the heat. As I did yesterday, I unconsciously walked very slowly in the heat. By 3:30 when I reached route 2, I had not quite gone ten miles. I had heat rash in multiple locations, and it was quickly getting worse. I called the Willows Motel and they very quickly sent somebody to pick me up. 
I was checked in within about two minutes. I walked over to the room. The AC was set to 60 degrees. I collapsed on the bed and soaked up the coolness. After a time I stripped and was amazed at the sheer variety of locations in which I found heat rash. After I showered, I applied ointment and climbed back onto the bed, willing the rash to diminish. 
This actually sort of worked. When it seemed like it wouldn't hurt to move, I walked to the restaurant next door and ordered one of everything. Or at least I really wanted to. I really ordered some wine, potato skins, and a broccoli and chicken dish. I debated pizza but the broccoli sounded healthier. In retrospect I wish I had gotten the pizza. My entree was fine, but pizza still sounded good. 
I left the diner and stopped by the gas station next door to get some breakfast and an ice cream cone. I was disappointed when I returned to the motel to find out that my room fridge doesn't work. Warm coke is less appealing. 
Old Growth walked up to where I sat outside the motel eating my cone. We chatted for a while until he brought out pictures of his adorable dogs and told me their stories. Unfortunately the sky opened up before I could show him Dulce's underbite or the essential dogness of Beauty. 
I should probably figure out what I'm doing tomorrow. It's complicated by not having guidebook pages. I don't know, maybe I'll go for a walk in Vermont.","Mark Noepel Shelter

It poured last night. I didn't think much about it at the time, but in the morning when I noticed the wet tables and chairs outside, I was grateful not to have to take down a wet tent. 
I woke up tired at five and went back to sleep. A little after six I woke up still tired, but started moving around. I was tired enough to seriously consider staying at the motel another day. JD suggested that the heat in the last two days might be responsible. I think it was a contributing factor. I find the heat draining, plus I wasn't eating much. I did have restaurant meals every day, but I think it still didn't add up to enough. Dale suggested lower mileage and more food, and I think he's right. 
I get anxious about Lyme whenever I get fatigue like that. Having had it four times, I know that fatigue is a good indicator. But so are fever and headache and body aches and swollen glands, and I don't have those. However if I start having additional symptoms, or the fatigue isn't relieved by rest and food, I'll find somewhere to get checked out. 
The breakfast at the motel was startlingly good. Mostly I was excited about the fresh fruit and dove into the cherries and strawberries. But there were a variety of pastries and nine kinds of bread/bagels/English muffins to toast, plus juices and coffee and spreads and yogurt and cereal. It was better than breakfast at most large motels, and even better than most B&Bs that I've been to. My overall experience at Willows Motel was excellent. It isn't high end, but it's clean and comfortable, and there are many little touches that show they care. 
After breakfast I decided to thin out the pack a little. I removed excess food and beverages, my extra phone charger (as the higher capacity one I bought in Great Barrington is working well), and $3.31 in change. That's a lot of metal to be carrying around.  The pack felt quite a bit better afterward, even though I added back a bottle of coke. I'm still carrying more food than I need, but I couldn't make myself throw away any Packit Gourmet meals. I had ended up with at least a week's worth of beverage mix, which I ruthlessly winnowed. I also still have an entire bottle of spiced rum. I opened it tonight and it doesn't appeal anymore. Dammit. I should have stuck with scotch. 
The hiking today was pleasant and pretty, with the added bonus of crossing another state line. Metso and Pierogi were lunching near the sign so I got Metso to take my picture. I ate lunch (aka reducing pack weight) and headed north again. Mindful of my energy, I stopped at the first shelter. The next is seven miles away and would have meant arriving quite late. 
Several other folks are tented here. I'm set up across a log from Old Growth. The bugs have been pretty fierce, so as of right now, nobody is in the shelter. I wouldn't be surprised if later arrivals sheltered, though. It will be much cooler tonight. The bugs should settle down in a few hours. 
Tomorrow if all goes as planned, I'll hike to the Bennington crossing and get a ride to town. I would like to wash my clothes again, though that isn't a requirement. I definitely need to get three days of food. If I'm there at the right time I'd like to ship some gear, too. I don't think I need a fleece top *and* a down jacket now. They were nice in late April, but it's June now. Hard to believe. Hard to believe that much time has passed. Or that I've walked nearly 600 miles.","Williamstown

I slept well in my tent and woke up feeling like a rock star. My low mileage, high calorie day worked out great! I fetched my food bag and had a high protein breakfast, minus some smoothie I spilled on my tent. Whoopsie! I rinsed it off as best I could. That won't keep me awake worrying about bears, or anything. Sheesh. I might as well rub honey on myself. 
I got going a little before seven. The day was cool and beautiful, and the terrain was gently rolling and less muddy than Vermont often is. I went by several ponds, where I paused to listen to the croaking of bullfrogs. I couldn't see them but the calls came from all around the edges of the ponds, echoing across the water. Several times today I thought I heard voices, only to realize that it was bullfrogs when I stopped to listen. Too funny!
My pack was nice and light with minimal food left in it, and with lots of water around me today, I limited what I carried to one liter. Of course this meant receiving new mosquito bites whenever I stopped to filter water. The skeeters are getting aggressive. I was surprised to find that they could bite through my sturdy pants. The permethrin is not a problem for them. My bug spray only works for short times as well. I haven't yet gotten desperate enough to use deet, because that cure is so far worse than the symptoms. We'll see, though. 
I got to the road a little after three. Trail angel Oneismus offered me a soda and an ice cream sandwich, which I gratefully accepted and devoured. We talked for a bit, then I set about getting a ride into town. I should have called for a ride from up on the mountain. There was no signal by the road. Instead I relied on my thumb and a smile. My backup plan was the 4:30 bus - which is apparently painted with cow spots?
A mom driving her son to Grandma's house picked me up. Sid told me all about his school and a video game he liked as we made our way to Grandma's. Then mom took me the rest of the way to town on the way to run her errands. 
I found my way to the motel, showered, and collected my clothes to be laundered. Then I got a ride to the Dollar General. I managed to leave with only enough to fill my little daypack. Shopping for food is a fairly haphazard activity. It's hard to buy things in the right multiples, and most places don't have everything I want. But I managed to cobble together food and supplies for a few days. 
Next stop was the Madison Brewing Company for a blueberry wheat beer and a burger the size of my head. The burger came with cheese, thick cut bacon, an onion ring, and steak sauce. The server dropped off a pile of napkins, unasked. That's a good sign, right? I stared at the burger for a while, trying to figure out how to fit it in my mouth. Finally I shrugged and mashed it into a shorter configuration- but not before the concerned waitress checked to make sure I was all right. I guess most people don't stare at their burger first. The burger was delicious and juicy. I needed all the napkins. 
It came with fries, and I ordered a side of grilled asparagus because I'm trying not to die of malnutrition. At home I eat a LOT more fruits and vegetables than I manage here. The asparagus was good. I finished it first. 
I had thought about calling for a ride back to the motel, but when I left the restaurant, my feet just sort of went there on their own. 
I spent the rest of the evening sorting things out, separating a few items out to be mailed. And now I'm tired. I think it's about time for snoozing. I hope the gathering of hikers outside their rooms gets tired and goes to bed too. I don't begrudge their fun but I'd just as soon it happened a little further away from me.","Seth Warner Shelter

I should have stayed in bed. 
I woke up at six and fiddled around. I don't even really know what I did but I wasted an hour until I figured the gas station would be open, then went and bought a coke. And a coffee. And a spare protein bar. 
Back at the motel I ate my poptarts - breakfast of champions. I packed up and headed for the post office, where I mailed forward my fleece top and silk bottoms. Guess what would be nice to have with me right now?
I called for a ride to the trail and got walking around 9:30. I stopped to eat at the first shelter. While I was sitting there it started to pour. Sigh. 
I walked in the rain for hours. I stayed just barely warm enough with everything thing possible zipped / tightened / enclosed. I did somewhat enjoy splashing through puddles. But in the rain I couldn't really stop to look around, and there wasn't much to see if I did. All of my being was focused on walking. 
Unfortunately my being apparently sucks at focus. I went TIMBER! Twice. First time I nailed my right knee, left wrist, and sternum. Second time I nailed my left knee, right hand, and forehead. At least the second fall seems to have jarred back into place two ribs that had been hurting after the first fall. So that was nice. 
When I finally arrived at the shelter, there was a spot left and I claimed it. I ate a greenbelly bar and called it good - time to hang food and put on my jammies.  One more hiker showed up and we all shuffled to make room. There are a lot of people camped in the woods around us, many of them illegally. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. It's a fairly awful day, but it's the Friday of a summer weekend.

I counted 14 red efts today. They might be endangered somewhere, but not right here. They appear to thrive in Vermud's damp environment. 
I awoke this morning feeling surprisingly fine. Between my all day soaking and the bad falls I took, I expected to be sore or bruised or headachy. But apparently sleep cured me. I got along just fine without my fleece and silk, as well. And I sure did appreciate not having to carry their weight up the mountain this morning. 
The bugs were really bad today. Only my hands were uncovered, and I had to spray them several times. This evening I'm secure in my tent, away from the ravening hordes. Sleeping in a shelter held zero appeal. Predicted rain never arrived, and between the sunshine and the bugs, my tent is a far more attractive option. 
Before I unfurl my sleeping bag I'll have to do a little housekeeping. I didn't realize just how muddy my pants were until I sat down and it started flaking off. I estimate I was carrying an 1/8"" layer from the knees down. My feet look awful from being wet all day, but they don't feel too bad. 
I'm the only one set up at this site so far. I hope more people camp here. It's too close to the road for comfort, but I don't have another seven miles in me to get to Stratton Pond tonight. I'm wondering if people stayed at Story Spring instead. It was under nine miles from Goddard Shelter, but it's fairly slow trail thanks to mud and blowdowns. Mostly mud.","Goddard Shelter

This shelter is amazing. Four walls, a door, and a functional wood stove. Not that the stove is useful when it's still 80 degrees at 7 pm. I'm going to have to sleep in my bag liner. 
The weather for today was predicted to be bad. It was sunny. It's predicted to have 2-4 inches of rainfall tomorrow. I'm withholding judgment until it actually rains. I was thinking of going the extra three miles into town today but I chafed in the heat, so stopping sounded very appealing. Also the thought of calling around for a reservation and then finding my way to a motel sounded like I would have to interact with many human beings.  Whereas at the shelter I could lie down right away, eat food I don't really enjoy but which fills me up, and antisocially not talk to anybody. That sounded great. 
I stopped in at Stratton Pond shelter to use the privy today, but the poop was already up to the lid. So gross. Where's the maintainer? Then the next shelter was half a mile off the trail, so that wasn't happening. I ended up walking fifteen miles to use a privy today. I'm so proud of my sphincter. That was some serious bowel control going on. Clearly I have a magnificently competent asterisk. 
I don't know what to tell you, man. Things get weird in my head on the trail.","Stratton-Arlington road

I woke up at 5:30 and ate a leftover chunk of protein bar. My smoothie did not appeal. Stupid appetite. Those are expensive smoothies!
The trail between the shelter and the road is not as represented on my map. The map shows it going mostly downhill. There was a lot of uphill. But my food bag was mostly empty so it was still a pretty easy hike. 
Odysseus (the first sobo I've met) had mentioned trail magic at the road. It was still there when I got there. I had Gatorade, fresh cherries, and a donut. A donut! The cherries were the best though. 
There was a Toyota RAV4 in the parking lot with the driver's door wide open. It didn't look broken in to. When Madeline arrived, she looked too. Based on the dog gear we're assuming the driver just forgot to shut it. We closed the door to keep it from running the battery down. 
Madeline drove me to town and we grabbed some breakfast. I was on third breakfast by then. She showed me where some things were in town, intending to leave me with the car while she taught riding. Then the heavens opened up and riding was cancelled. After that I had her all to myself. 
I got a few things at Mountain Goat Outfitters, and ran into quite a few hikers that I knew. It's always entertaining to walk into a business in a town you're visiting and see it full of familiar faces. 
We also visited Rite Aid, Shaw's Grocery, and a state liquor store. So I'm pretty much stocked up. Should be fun trying to wedge everything into the pack tomorrow. 
When we got back to her place and I undressed to shower, I found that my bruises, chafes, bug bites, and other skin injuries were worse than I realized. I hope that my feet benefited from my nearo, but they still look pretty rough at bedtime. I'm not sure what to do for them. Wish them luck.

Man yesterday worked out well. It was quite pleasant watching the torrents of rain fall from Madeline's. And I got to soak up some doggie love. And eat a lot. 
Today it looks like it might not rain, and between rest and coffee, the morning miles are coming easily. My shoes are sort of turning into sandals so pebbles are an issue, but it is nevertheless a great day. 
As I summited the peak after Bromley, Lazer passed by and I commented that Vermont felt like my reward for surviving Pennsylvania. Then I got to the zone of amazing smelling firs and thought ""Oh my god YES!""  I wondered if this euphoria is what it feels like to be high. 
My red eft count hit 12 today, in 7 hours. Pretty sure my eft rate was higher going into Great Barrington, but it was still pretty high today.  
I spent my day listening to my wedding reception playlist as I walked. It brought back all kinds of great memories, both of falling in love with JD and of getting married. 
I also spent some time thinking of things for which I am grateful:Having the opportunity to visit with Madeline at her beautiful house.Stepping stones. Not a metaphor, but actual stones you step on so you can avoid mud or water. The lessons of the Bhagavad Gita. Not sure I spelled it right. Understanding is coming slowly for me. I'm not rereading it right now, but it's one of those texts which seep into your consciousness. My husband, without whom I would not be doing this hike. Sunny weather. Mass quantities of food. Health. 
I'm enjoying the contrast between this hike and the one in 2010. I still struggle, but I have more patience with myself and with the trail. The mental aspects of thruhiking far outweigh the physical. Not that it's particularly easy, physically. I think that after last year, which was a very long exercise in suffering and healing and accepting, my ability to accept the hand I'm dealt on any given day is vastly improved over previous years. Given that there is absolutely nothing you can do about the trail or the weather, acceptance is a vital skill to have here. Or at least that's the way it seems to me. 
There is a group from Oberlin here doing a training, after which they'll take groups of kids out on trips to various places including Iceland or Costa Rica. They built a fire to help combat the bugs, bless 'em. Thruhikers almost never bother, but it is nice to have a fire.","Manchester

Happy solstice! Also Happy Naked Hiking Day! Not a joke, this is a real thing. FYI I was completely dressed as usual. 
Haley got moving first and it eventually shamed me into getting up. Well, that and the thought of poptarts. I put on my hiking clothes, packed up my sleeping bag, and proceeded to the picnic table to make coffee. I haven't been doing that most mornings, but yesterday demonstrated just how much more effective coffee is at getting me going than my energy drinks are. 
It was delicious. Actually they were delicious. Coffee, poptarts, pretty much anything I could find to put in my pie hole. 
I started walking right around 6:30, and probably started snacking before I was out of sight of the shelter. The rock climb I remembered was in fact before the next shelter, so I was glad I stopped when I did last night. Also because it poured torrentially for a while in the evening and I would have been between shelters then. Probably on that rock climb. 
I played leapfrog with Phat D (""That's my rap name"") in the morning. We met up at Little Rock Pond and walked together in the afternoon. I had started seeing naked hikers as soon as we crossed the road before the pond, and the trend continued for a while. I saw two individuals and then a group of about eight. Mostly it was older men. There was one woman, young and fit. Several of the men had all over tans so I concluded that today was not an anomaly for them. 
I was morally fine with all of this. Mostly I just had issues with where to look. Look away entirely? Glance and look away? Maintain a desperate eye contact?
Most days I keep an eft count in my head. I use The Count's accent from Sesame Street whenever I see one. Sometimes I do it out loud. Instead, today I counted naked people. ""Ten! Ten naked wieners! Hah hah hah hah!""
I've never seen so many naked wieners in one day before, and that includes the time my dormitory floor collectively rented and watched Dickman and Throbbin'.","Peru Peak Shelter

I woke up more tired than when I went to sleep. That's not how that's supposed to work. Thanks a lot, body. Thanks bunches. 
Phat D said bye on his way out, and I told him I was revising today's plan. Fifteen miles seemed out of reach. But bad weather is predicted for tomorrow, so getting as close as I can to the base of Killington would be nice. That way I could maybe get over the peak before the worst weather came in. 
I put on podcasts and let Sawbones distract and entertain me. I started to feel better as the morning went on. I ate tons, trying to use the food for energy. I think it worked. By the time I got to Clarendon Gorge, I felt almost normal. I decided to walk the half mile to the Whistle Stop to see if it were open, as I had conflicting reports. And I really wanted a coke. 
Sadly it was closed. And empty. And for sale. I wasn't overly surprised or disappointed. I turned around and walked back to the trail. It was worth the 25 minutes to check. 
The hike up the boulder filled ravine took about forever. 
When I got to Clarendon Shelter, I was ready to try for more, but everyone else was stopping. I really didn't want to go to Governor Clement myself, given its party reputation. I eventually decided to take the short day. Given how I felt in the morning, its probably for the best. Or so I tell myself. I have enough food to accommodate an extra day. 
I'm definitely looking forward to a day off, though. Not that it will feel much like one by the time I do my chores. One of these times I'm going to take a double zero. How decadent that sounds! Two whole days off in a row. I could eat six restaurant meals in a row. Mmm, mass quantities.","Greenwall Shelter

I got up as soon as it was light-ish, around 4:15. I was on the trail by 5:30. 
I once again let the weather worries of others affect me. In fact, there was a short period of light rain today, and that was it. Not worth any fuss!
The climb from Clarendon Shelter north was a beast. I wished that I had had coffee. Eventually my heart sputtered up and it didn't feel like I was dying as I trudged up the hill. It reminded me of the midnight fire alarms in college, when my sleepy legs had to go up five flight of stairs afterward and it felt like burning. 
Killington went on forever. The weather wasn't a problem,but the bugs were. They bit right through my pants. How? I don't know but it hurt like hell. 
When I got to Cooper Lodge I took the peak trail so I could visit the cafe at the gondola up top. It was not hiking. It was a long steep rock scramble and no cafe at the end. Fortunately a couple was at the top and took me on another trail to the cafe. 
The cafe was closing early because they were hosting a wedding today. I got there with twenty minutes to spare and ordered a $16 burger and a coke. Not worth the tough climb up. However as I was leaving I met VitaMan who told me there was a short, easy trail (with stairs!) to take back to Cooper Lodge. I was thankful but also furious that there was no way to tell that before I went up. I definitely would not have dragged my sorry ass over all those rocks, had I known. 
After that I headed on to Churchill Scott Shelter. Not sure who all is tented, but I'm in the shelter with Powerhouse. Whistler made dinner at the shelter and Lilo and Stitch sat here for a while too. 
Apparently while I was focused on climbing today, my fanny pack chafing got out of control. Powerhouse helped me put bandages on it. At least she doesn't think it looks infected. I need to figure something out. Different fanny pack? Hang it from my neck? I dunno but my skin sure doesn't like the way things are right now. 
I'm missing home a lot right now. It's been over two months away, and it will probably be two more before I see my house. At least I get to see JD soon. He's going to visit me on the trail for a couple of days. They can't come too soon for me.","Clarendon Shelter

My sleep last night was restless. I put bug junk on my face to keep the gnats away, but the smell was so strong it was hard to sleep through. Then I had nightmares about a man coming to steal my food bag. Which is at least a very thruhiker dream to have. 
It rained as I walked down the mountain. I think technically it fogged, but it did so very wetly. Every wind shivered drops off the leaves. 
I finally got to the road and settled in to wait for the bus. But after fifteen minutes or so I started to realize that it could be a very long time before I saw a bus, and I stuck my thumb out. Five cars later, Kristin ""Siren"" McLane pulled over to pick me up. She was in town to take some folks on a backpacking trip, and was coincidentally driving down the road as I was standing there. So cool! And nice to see her!
She dropped me off at the hostel in town. I got a bunk, a hot shower, and a filling breakfast right off the bat. I washed my clothes, then went out to buy supplies.  But first, more food at the brewpub next door. It doesn't do to shop on an empty stomach. Not that mine was. 
I noticed a movie theater and checked the time on Wonder Woman, then went back to the hostel to relax. I decided on movie theater popcorn for dinner, so no need to do anything about that meal. 
At six I headed for a theater, bought a popcorn that really deserved its own wheelbarrow, and settled in. The popcorn was a mistake that left me queasy, but the movie? So. Bad. Ass. I loved it!
Back at the hostel, all these vibrant young people are still having fun at 10 pm, and for some reason somebody is using power tools. Argh! This was why I really would have preferred to stay in a motel. Not that I've never heard noise at a motel. The hostel is convenient to things I need, and they are extremely kind and helpful. But it's still a hostel, bustling with humanity.
My plans for tomorrow are unclear. I know I don't want to stay here. My knees and skin irritations might like another day off. If so, I'll trek to a motel somewhere. Or maybe go back to the trail for a couple more miles and see if they have a room at the Inn at the Long Trail.

For some reason construction happened after 10 pm last night. The thruhikers were all ""argh!""
I woke up around 6:30 and got up to make a cup of coffee. At 7:30 I found my way down to the deli for complimentary breakfast. It was pretty great. Coffee, eggs with corned beef and tomatoes in them, brown rice, fruit, and carrot cake. We ate at a big round table. It was nice. I have to say that despite the Yellow Deli's funky religious reputation, I really enjoyed my stay. It's well run, clean, kind, and thoughtful. Nobody pressured me to do anything. We were welcome to join in on a group thought sharing session, although I didn't.  It was easy going. This morning, the manager said to us ""If you aren't likely to need a nap, please strip your beds."" I mean, they are okay with, aware of, and plan for naps!
After breakfast I caught the bus back to the trail. Within fifteen minutes I knew I wanted to stop for the day at the Inn at the Long Trail if they had a room. My chafed parts still hurt. Either way, though, I'd get some lunch there. 
They did have a room, yay! I checked in and ate a huge lunch - potato skins, turkey apple sandwich, slaw, two Guinness/Harp half and halfs, and a root beer float. I thought I was full until I saw the root beer float on the menu..
Then I took a really excellent nap. There has been insufficient napping in my life as of late. 
I woke up around six and toddled downstairs. Agent Starling was in the bar, and I enjoyed talking to her while I ordered and ate dinner. A few other hikers came in, and we had a good time talking. 
Back at my room I cleaned up as well as I could. I'm kind of long term smelly by now. But I washed and stuff. And I put ointment on my many owies. I may try more bandages tomorrow to see if it helps. It's ludicrous how problematic my skin is. I'm lucky not to have gotten any infections yet. I've known hikers who ignored their chafing and ended up having to take antibiotics after the wounds got infected. Yikes.

I've been thinking about this all day. I better write it down so I don't have to think about it tomorrow. 
You can use the horse and rider relationship as a metaphor for your mind body relationship when you're doing yoga. Specifically when you consider people forcing a stretch, this seems apt to me. 
When you ride a horse, you hold onto the reins and pull on them to do things with the horse's head. If you pull hard, to protect himself the horse will tighten his jaw, neck, and other muscles required to support the head and neck. He will pull just as hard against the reins as you are pulling on him. You, the rider, will also tighten your arms and back, which is needed to support your arms. With both of you tight, you sacrifice flexibility and posture. The horse will focus on resisting at the head, and his back and hips will reflect the tension you have inflicted. 
If, however, you supply a gentle tension, the horse does not need to resist, and can in fact relax a little bit. Without the threat of force, he can choose to submit to the pressure and stretch through the neck muscles. If you imagine that the horse is your partner, you can compare it to the partner stretches done in dance or martial arts, where one person pulls and the other person relaxes and is passively stretched. If you've ever experienced this kind of partner stretch, you know that it feels amazing. So when the horse is able to stretch using the gentle pressure you provide, it can be pleasant for him. And it leaves him not resisting, and very aware of the tension you are supplying. The softer the tension, the more precisely he can focus on it, as one can focus on the incredibly soft touch of a feather on one's skin. 
Applying this metaphor to your mind and body, your mind is the rider and your body is the horse. If you push yourself to stretch deeply by pushing or pulling strongly, your muscles tend to resist. You can tear a muscle (or a ligament!) by trying to force it to stretch past the point it is ready for. However, if you lean very gently into a stretch, and breathe, you can allow your muscle to relax gently. On the next exhale you can provide room for your muscle to stretch a little more. Just as I must listen to what my horse is telling me through the reins and how he is using his body, so I must listen to my muscles as they tell me how much they are ready to stretch in any given moment. Forcing the issue in either case leads to resistance and a loss of the flexibility I seek. 
I hope I don't have to think about that all day tomorrow.

It continues to amaze me how much comfort I take in sleeping in the company of virtual strangers. Some primal part of me feels the safety in numbers. I felt that feeling last night and I slept so well. Though it could also have been the Benadryl. 
It poured last night after I got to the shelter and I was happy to be indoors, for certain values of indoors. It's three sided, but it has a roof and that's the key. 
I packed insufficient snacks today so I had to walk the last couple of hours hungry. I got to the shelter around two and plunged into my food bag, eating a little of everything. When it finally got to be five, I heated water for dinner and ate it hungrily, scraping out the last bits. I think my hiker hunger has ramped up. 
It was weird to stop so early but the shelters are awkwardly spaced, and I don't recall good campsites either. Last time I ended up camping on a slope, which isn't fun. I'm trying to tell myself the trail gave me the afternoon off, but I just feel slack. Tomorrow is only a little over twelve miles - still not ideal. But I'm hoping to stop at a farm market and eat a pie (not a slice. A pie.) so that'll take up some time.

This morning we were all energized to get to the farm stand. Le Chef, Safari, Boss, Goddess and I walked the four miles together. I had coffee so I mostly kept up. I've camped with them the last few days and they're a great bunch - a husband and wife and a mother and daughter. 
I demolished a blueberry pie and two cokes, and picked up two packets of Gatorade powder for later. We headed across route 12 and into a section that seemed radically longer than the book says. It has a lot of steep trail, of the kind where there isn't a good place to push off. Very few rocks or roots to give a solid base. That terrain is awful for me - my calves overstretch and burn. The other four went ahead and I followed at my own pace. 
At Pomfret Road there was trail magic - sodas next to a stream. I chugged a root beer. 
I ate a whole lot of snacks today so I hope I have energy for the trek into Hanover tomorrow. We called a local trail angel who will let us stay at their house tomorrow night. That will be nice. I just want the basics out of Hanover. Shower, laundry, groceries, a good meal. I guess I need some non basics after all, because I also need denatured alcohol and preferably adhesive backed Velcro.

We all woke up feeling tired from yesterday. It was Le Chef's birthday but he wasn't really talking but his body language was glum. We all made coffee, ate breakfast, and started walking. 
The terrain was 100% easier than yesterday. The hills mostly only went on until I was just on the edge of needing to stop, then they'd level out. Boss and Goddess surged ahead while I walked near Safari and Le Chef. 
When we got to Norwich, Goddess waved at us from a porch so we went over. Randy and Linda have drinks and snacks for hikers. Somehow Linda created a surprise birthday cake for Le Chef! And they brought out little ice cream cups too. The look on Le Chef's face was amazing. 
It turned out that he had been having neck and back pain, though. Linda agreed to slackpack us four women, and Le Chef rode with her to the house of the trail angel who was putting us up in Norwich. The four of us moved quickly. Well, only three did until I figured out that I had to rotate my fanny pack around to my back. Otherwise sciatic pain slowed me way down. 
We arrived at Norwich to meet Warren, our host. I liked him immediately. I made much of his dog Nellie and we all had showers and washed clothes. Warren took us to Carpenter and Main, a fancy restaurant in Norwich. We had a wonderful but expensive meal. I tried to buy Warren's dinner but he refused. 
Sadly during dinner Safari announced that Le Chef was leaving the trail. We sure will miss him, Safari most of all of course.

Apparently it poured last night. With my earplugs in, I was oblivious. The others were grateful, though. 
When Warren got up he offered to get some breakfast sandwiches at Dan&Whit's, which we accepted. We made coffee and all ate sitting on his porch, looking out at his beautiful view. Warren really has a great house. And I think he's a pretty special person. I was so glad to have a chance to meet him, and greatly appreciated his generosity. He even lent us his car so we could visit the grocery and outfitters. 
I bought a wool base layer and a fleece top which I already regret. My pack was beastly heavy when I left Hanover. It felt fine at Warren's. Something about the gelato, pizza, and beer I had in town made it heavier. I hope it feels lighter tomorrow. It probably won't though. 
We left Le Chef behind at Warren's. He's catching a train tomorrow. Safari is obviously going to miss him. She hadn't intended to do this hike solo. She'll still see him, though. He's going to get their car and see her between sections. I bet he even slackpacks her a little. There could be worse things in life.

I just looked at the label on my sopping wet hat. ""Do not get wet."" Ha! Hahahahaha! Heh. 
Today we had a biblical rain, both in the immensity and intensity of it, and in the part where it was screwing with us. 
It rained a bit overnight but it was not raining at daybreak. I had breakfast in bed and then packed up. The others did things in a different order so I sat with them while they made breakfast. 
At 7:30 I headed out with the others following shortly. We had agreed that if we got to Moose Mountain Shelter by two, we would press on to Trapper John for a fifteen mile day. So I needed to get moving. I was passed quickly by Goddess and Boss but not Safari. As the miles passed I wondered and worried.  She hikes faster than me. She should have passed me within the first hour. 
It was hot and humid, and I was so ready for it to rain. When it did, I suddenly became water cooled and could pick up my pace. I was a comfortable temperature so I never put on rain gear, which would only have made me sweat. My clothes stuck to me more or less depending on how intensely it rained. 
At 1:30 I arrived at Moose Mountain to find a bunch of hikers in the shelter, including Goddess and Boss. I plopped down to eat a snack. Safari finally showed up. She had accidentally taken a side trail, which blew an hour. I was glad to see her. 
I got out my phone to find water pooled in its ziplock. The bag looked new. I don't know why it failed. Miraculously the fellow sitting next to me had a bag of instant rice to put the phone in for a while. Thanks, Pockets! The phone appears to have survived. I double bagged it in two other ziplocks for the remainder of the day. My guidebook pages suffered a similar bag failure but are far less critical. 
Despite more rain in the forecast we decided to move on. We walked together for three miles, talking over the rain as well as we were able. When we got to the climb up to Holt's Ledges, I fell to the back of the group. Safari was in front of me, climbing in a rhythm as regular as a metronome. I walked a little faster but stopped to rest often, so our pace worked out the same. As the miles sloshed by, her metronome turned to more of a toy with the batteries running down. 
The rain intensified as we went up the mountain. In all my miles, I've never seen flooding this bad. The top of the mountain was flooding, cascading down the sides wherever the water could find a way. The trail itself had rapids. Occasional piles of leaves would let go in mini landslides. 
We finally reached the summit and started descending. I could hear water roaring somewhere. We had to pass a stream twice to get to the turnoff for the shelter. I think if we had gotten there fifteen minutes later, we might have been stuck on the other side. It was only shin deep but the current was strong. 
Despite the trail turning into a slip'n'slide, I managed to stay upright all day until I was in sight of the shelter. I misjudged a rapid and went down on the side of the trail. I wasn't hurt. My pants got slightly dirtier and my water bottle cap got a little contaminated. Possible gut issues were so far down my list of troubles as to be nonexistent. 
The shelter was full, of course. I haven't been down to it but the others had. We set up our tents uphill of the shelter. I think we're in a safe enough location. The water is diverting around us on either side. Of course, that could change. I don't think there is a truly safe place tonight unless you're in a hammock. I'm not going to worry about it too much.","Velvet Rocks Shelter

I woke up at 7 and honestly I could have slept more. Yesterday was a hard, hard day. The rain made walking much harder as we dragged ourselves against the current of the water flowing in the trail. Each step that slipped used up more energy. Counting the seconds between flash and kaboom added to the anxiety of the day. 
Today dawned bright and clear and beautiful. It was hard to believe I was in the same world as yesterday. As we packed up, a woman with two dogs walked up and spoke to Safari. She hollered ""We're going to her house!"" Ann invited us back to her place to dry out. And have coffee. And have a full breakfast. And charge things. And pet her dogs. It was pretty much an oasis. 
Unfortunately I was feeling crumby so I was kind of green. After a while just lay down and watched the clouds go by until everybody was ready to leave. Due to the rain yesterday there was pretty serious flooding, and Ann had received a phone call that people were to stay off the roads except for emergencies. But she figured we weren't going too far so we all piled into her truck to ride back to the trail. After the long walk down the mountain to Ann's none of us wanted to walk back up the mountain just so we could walk back down on the AT. So she drove us down the road and pointed out where the trail crossed, then said ""Why don't I take you to the base of the mountain?"" She received unanimous agreement. 
We walked up Smarts Mountain and all agreed that it was a tough walk. When we got to the top I was doing mental math about how long it would take to get to Hexacuba and I was overjoyed when everybody else wanted to stop for the day. Wahoo!
The bugs were awful outside so I've been hiding in the cabin. As usual we've been laughing loudly at our own jokes and I'm pretty sure scaring off all the men. Which is just fine by me.","Trapper John Shelter

The hike today was ludicrously difficult thanks to damage done by the storm. Trail was washed out, flooded, slippery, silted in, and sometimes missing. In areas it looked as if there had been a lahar, with mud not local to the site covering the ground. One of the stream crossings had been eroded so ruinously the multiple trees on both sides had fallen into the stream. 
I was glad that we stayed where we did last night, as streams we crossed today were still running high. Signs of flooding further up the embankments made it clear that the levels had come down, but we easily could have found many of the streams impassable. 
My feet were wet all day from fording streams, walking through mud, falling into wet areas, and otherwise having a not fantastic time. 
Late in the day we crossed a paved road which had been washed out and undercut on one side. The little bridge near it had water running under it, nearly touching the bridge. It's clear that we had walked through a very serious storm. It had felt like heavy rain, and was surely impressive up on top of the mountains, but I didn't realize how destructive it would be. The effects will be visible for some time to come. 
Safari is ready for a day off, and I am too. But JD is coming soon and it doesn't make much sense for me to take a day off just now. I'm not sure what I'll do. It might be good to bank some miles so I get to keep hiking with my friends after JD's visit.","Fire Warden's Cabin

I slept awfully. My sleeping pad was on a slant and had roots under it. There were fireworks going off. I ached so much that it was hard to fall asleep. When I finally did, I had to get up to pee three times during the night. At two I got cold and had to put on more clothes and put my foam pad under my air mattress. I wanted a solid ten hours, but I figure I got a sketchy seven. 
At six I heard rustling and saw that Safari was taking her tent down. Bitching mightily, I packed up. She informed me that the branch our bear bags were on broke during the night. Luckily nothing came and ate our food. I made coffee. Out of poptarts, I had a protein smoothie and a snickers for breakfast. I may have snarled at all my camp mates. 
Everyone else left and I went to visit the privy. Somebody had gotten cute and gone with a medieval theme. The throne was literal. 
I fell within the first half hour thanks to the fricking mud. 
As this was clearly going to be a day in which things went wrong, I tried to walk as carefully as I could. 
I listened to podcasts and walked. No sights were noted. No efts were seen. Eventually I got to the road and walked down to the hostel. 
At the hostel I got a cold coke, which always helps. And a gorgeous hot shower. And a variety of boxes. I now have new shoes, a warm sleeping bag, and gloves. I'm ready for the whites. Oh and my new backpack! It will take a few days to sort out all the adjustments. 
For tomorrow I've borrowed a daypack from the hostel to slackpack Mooselauke southbound. I did it that way last time and still feel it's the safest way. I'll carry my pack back into the woods the day after that.","Ore Hill

We got up early to be ready to leave by 7 and were headed up the north side of Moosilauke by 7:30. Although the others quickly disappeared into the distance, I was pleased by how easy the climb felt compared to last time. When I reached the summit, I found spectacular views and it was surprisingly not chilly at all. I expected to need a jacket but instead I borrowed sunscreen from Safari. 
On the descent I stupidly took somebody's advice and took off my shoes to ford a river. I was reminded that I had good reason for deciding to wear my shoes in rivers years ago. Walking on the river bottom hurt! And then I didn't have any way to really clean the sand off my feet, so the last quarter mile to the hostel abraded skin off my feet. Oh, was I grumpy. 
But a shower and dinner helped. I talked to other hikers and ate hot dogs. Then I lay in a hammock, staring up through leaves as a man played a guitar and sang. I couldn't distinguish the words but it was soothing.

Apparently Safari had a pretty good time last night. I was up before her, which is unheard of. 
We got packed up, paid, and got shuttled back to Kinsman Notch.  I remembered the hike as being difficult from 2010. It hadn't changed. Boss had thought maybe we would blow through it and move on to Kinsman Pond, but that was wildly optimistic. 
My new pack and shoes were feeling badly adjusted so I stopped to fix them, and the others were gone. I walked alone all day, barring other hikers passing. I hoped that I wasn't the only one finding the trail to be slow and strenuous. 
There wasn't really a good place to stop for lunch so I found a butt height rock and sat. As I sat eating, an adorable sobo in a dress and leggings climbed toward me and exclaimed ""Combos? They're the best!"" I said they were a staple, and she said she also liked Pepperidge Farm Cookies. We determined that we both liked mint milanos. She said ""Are we twinsies? Is that what's happening here?"" I laughed and agreed that it was as she climbed past me. 
When I finally arrived at the shelter and went to pull out my water filtering gear, it was missing. I realized that I had left it in an interior pocket of the daypack I borrowed yesterday. Shit. But Old English immediately offered to let me use his filter, which I appreciated immensely. I'm aggravated with myself for losing my gear. I don't have cell signal here but I hope to call from the top of a mountain tomorrow and ask Packrat to pull my gear out of the daypack. JD is planning  to stop and pick up a box anyway. 
I have to say that the privy at this shelter is egregiously far away and uphill. I think the only worse one is at Chairback Mountain shelter.","Hikers Welcome Hostel

We woke up nearly simultaneously at five and started packing up. Safari heated water for my coffee and let me filter water with her gear. I'm indebted to everybody for providing me with safe water. 
I had to hike back up to the privy which was still ludicrously far away. We were concerned about the chance for rain so we started hiking right after that, just before 7. 
The trail was a little easier than I remembered but it was still a notably hard hike. We spread out on the uphills but collaborated on the downhills to find the safest way down and support each other with help finding hand and footholds. It took us three hours to do the first 2.5 miles. 
We finally got to Lonesome Lake Hut. I was completely out of water so I filled up. We were all tired and ready to stop for the day but we had another four miles of rock hopping and river fording ahead of us. I felt fatigue dragging at every part of me. I somehow wrenched my right ankle on flat ground. It hurt so much that I was nauseated. Shortly after that I rolled my left ankle. My body was trying hard to tell me to stop, but it wasn't an option. 
My interior monologue was mostly four letter words at this point. 
We finally got to Liberty Springs Trailhead, where Le Chef was waiting for Safari and JD was waiting for me. I hugged my beloved and hollered goodbye to my friends. I am so looking forward to downtime with him this weekend.","Eliza Brook Shelter

I woke up in my deluxe cushy bed, turned over, and went back to sleep. I kept this up until I started having intrusive thoughts about coffee and other breakfasty things. The motel had a pretty great breakfast spread. I opted for pancakes, mostly so I could watch the machine make them for me. They helpfully made the front of the machine transparent. 
JD and I ran errands all morning. We visited two outfitters to find replacements for my lost gear, two groceries for my food resupply, and a liquor store for tiny bottles of fun. 
I called the hostel again and this time they found my missing items, so we backtracked to Glencliff. I really wanted my old stuff. My Deuce of Spades trowel is stellar at its job, and I missed my bottle and hydration pack adaptors so I was glad to get them back. I took some of the items out of the package I got at the outfitter. I want to experiment with using my Sawyer Squeeze as a gravity filter. It adds a couple of ounces to my load. 
My pack weight always seems to creep up on long trips. I clearly do this wrong. 
It was lunchtime when we got back to town so JD and I stopped for Chinese food with soft ice cream across the street for afters. JD got an incredibly gingery milkshake. I mean this was serious ginger. Unfortunately for me you could still feel bits of ginger snaps in it, which I find unpleasant. But it hit the spot for JD. 
He had bought a swimsuit for me since I didn't know where mine was. I put it on so we could use the motel hot tub. I found out that I'm more prudish and/or modest than I realized. I don't believe I've ever worn a garment that showed quite so much. JD gallantly offered me a shirt of his to wear down the hall. Since he's a foot taller than me, it came down to mid thigh on me. The only thing showing was the hot pink kinesiotape on my knee. 
After a post hot tub nap, we got together with Safari, Goddess, Boss, And Le Chef for a pretty great meal. They are heading back out tomorrow while I spend another day with JD. I think I'll take a side trail up to the AT to meet them on Monday. It'll be a little bit of a long day for me and I'll miss Franconia Ridge, but I'll get to see some new trail so that'll be nice. 
Maybe if things work out after I summit Katahdin, I'll stop on the way home and do Franconia Ridge. Or not. I'm not a huge purist and I've done it before, so it doesn't matter incredibly to me. Though it's a really pretty spot and a pity to miss it.","Lincoln

An utterly lovely day. We slept in, ate a late breakfast, and lay about our suite. Toward lunchtime I recalled seeing a Thai place in town, so we moseyed over. The food was spectacular. Fresh summer rolls packed chock full of delicious greens. Pad prik king and pad see yew that had a huge quantity of fresh vegetables in them, which was a thing we were seeking. The dishes tasted a little different from what I'm used to, but in a good way. If I lived near here I would be a regular. Even the mango with sticky rice was extra good. Hikers, stop in at Thai 9 in Lincoln if you're missing vegetables. Or Thai food. Or just good food, generally. 
Back at the motel, we mostly lolled about. I put together a bit more gear to be ready for the morning. We visited the hot tub again. JD and I had fun talking about nothing in particular. It was just a perfect lazy day. 
The two days off, in addition to giving me some wonderful husband time, have helped me heal some of my bites, scratches, bruises, etc. I'm still more beat up than your average civilian, but I feel ready to head back into the Whites for more adventures. 
I checked the weather and night time lows are around 50 for the foreseeable future. My 20 degree bag will be overkill, at least for now. But I have vivid memories of being cold and wet in Maine, and I know how fast it can happen. I'll put up with the extra pack weight.","Lincoln

JD woke up before me and headed into the shower. I spent the next ten minutes wishing desperately for a second bathroom. 
We had breakfast at the motel, checked out, and started driving toward the Gale River Trailhead. I kissed my husband goodbye and headed off into the woods, hoping he would have a safe drive home. 
The four mile hike up to the AT was fairly uneventful. Near where it started getting steep I crossed paths with a polite young man of indeterminate age. Perhaps 10 to 12? I checked my watch. 10:39. At 10:41 I met his mother and let her know he was two minutes ahead of her. At 10:47 I met his father and sister and updated them on the relative locations of mother and brother. That seemed to be the sum of the family, as nobody else appeared to inquire about the rest of them. 
Very shortly after I intersected with the AT. I started hearing voices and looked back to see Goddess! I had assumed they would be ahead of me and I would be solo all day. We walked the short distance to Galehead Hut and took a break. 
Safari showed up soon after. She was bound and determined not to hike the mile off trail to Guyot Shelter, so they made plans to go to a pond instead. 
I tackled the Twinway but found it much easier than my previous trip. I think just having hiked the Kinsmans made it feel easier. 
I walked on, finally reaching the pond. I found all my friends sitting at the trail junction. The Pond was more of a marsh and they couldn't get water. Instead we hiked on to a reliable brook. Boss found some relatively flat ground and we are all set up cheek by jowl. It's still more room than we would have in a shelter, and I like that it's just us. And it's free. 
I have hung one of my worst bear bags ever. I hope I still have food in the morning. Bear bagging options were minimal. I'm pretty careful about bear bagging but there is only so much you can do.","Lincoln

I woke up at 3:15 to the tapping of rain on the tent, checked to make sure nothing was pressing up against my tent screen (the foot of my sleeping bag was) and went back to sleep. 
At 5 I woke up, wished I'd had more sleep, and started changing into my hiking clothes. I ate a poptarts and cold coffee for breakfast, then packed up my tent. I'm in the habit of packing my tent last. The other three packed their tents first. It all worked out in the end. 
We walked the .6 to Zealand Hut to get water and use their toilet facilities. Then we utterly relished the flat trail for the next several miles. It was so nice to be able to stride out! But when we started downhill again, my right knee made it clear that it was not okay with going downhill. Unfortunately I didn't have good options for it. I tried taping it, which made it worse. I tried stretching, which helped but not enough. Mostly I limped and winced. It felt like maybe some tendonitis. 
I finally reached the road at 12:30 to find the next mountain looking ominous with a dark cloud behind it. Le Chef was parked at the road. Boss, Goddess, and Safari were already there. When I arrived we took off for the campground where Le Chef was staying. 
He suggested twice that maybe we would like to get a shower, so I finally took the hint. After we got clean, we went into Littleton to get food for the next section and some to eat in camp tonight - tortellini, alfredo sauce, salad, bread, and cheese. Then we stopped a couple of places until I found a knee strap. 
Back at the campground I got in the pool, the closest thing to ice I had. Eventually everyone else came over and we all hung out at the pool. And then we had an extremely fancy campground dinner. It kind of feels like a day off despite the miles we did this morning. 
I'm glad we're going uphill tomorrow but I'm worried about Mt Madison in a couple of days. It ended my hike in 2014, and I'm starting it now with a cranky knee.

Happy anniversary JD! Sorry we aren't together for it but the great weekend we just had helps make up for it. 
Anyone who hasn't walked up Webster Cliffs before might think that today's mileage is unimpressive. Let me assure you that the hike was pretty damn impressive, even if our miles hiked aren't. It started out on normal uphill terrain, then segued to slippery climbs up fairly sheer rock faces. I started walking around 7:30 and didn't finish until 3:30. The others took about the same time. It was a tough, tough day. I'm glad we already planned to stay here because I think we were all pretty done when we got here. 
Safari asked for work for stay because her tent fly is delaminating and she's worried about it holding up in predicted rain. They gave her morning chores for tomorrow - two hours worth. She didn't understand the deal and thought she'd be sleeping in a bunk, but work for stay gets the floor. It's not a bargain I want to have to make, although I would in an emergency. 
I walked up to the creek to get more water after my dinner, and the noise coming from the hut was impressive. I'm glad my tent platform is all the way at the back of the tenting area. You can't hear it at all from here. I imagine Safari is pretty miserable right now. I know I would be. 
Goddess, Boss and I are sharing one platform. It's a tight fit and there's a non-zero chance that my tent will collapse tonight, but it's quiet and it only cost me ten dollars to stay here so I'm happy with it. At any rate I'd far rather share with them than with strangers. 
I tried a simple concoction for dinner tonight and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I made alphabet pasta by adding boiling water to it in a ziplock and letting it sit in an insulated cup for fifteen minutes. Then I drank off the pasta water, mixed in Parmesan cheese, and added sliced pepperoni. It tasted pretty good!
My stomach has been a wee bit upset all day and I'm wondering if it's the watermelon I had this morning. Last time I had a full on puke fest so a little discomfort is nothing, but it makes me wonder if watermelon can still be a part of my life.","Crawford Notch

My tent, set up in cramped conditions, was really a one man tent last night, not a one and a half. I made it work and nothing got wet, but it was cramped. Still a better night's sleep than I tend to have in huts. But I am staying in a hut tonight. So I guess I'll get to compare. 
We all started waking up about six but it was raining and nobody was eager to get moving. I retrieved all three food bags and came back to make a cup of coffee. I ate my last poptart. I'll be sad about that when I have to eat oatmeal. I may have to suck it up and carry lighter, less tasty foods. The terrain is getting tougher and and the distance between towns may be longer in places. 
The hike today was almost entirely in clouds so I don't have much to say about it. I arrived at the next hut expecting to find the other three gung-ho to continue, but they had gotten work for stay and wanted to stay and be warm. Which is hard to argue with. I was fine to go on, but it doesn't take much to convince me to take the afternoon off. I had no interest in work for stay, though. Waiting until eight pm to eat and then do chores means being up way past hiker midnight, and my belly doesn't like eating that late. So I paid up for a tiny claustrophobic bunk. I wish I had noticed that some were made tall enough to sit up in when I chose a bunk, but I was oblivious. Sigh.

Not my best day ever. 
I didn't see Boss, Goddess, or Safari when I got up. I figured they were gone but knew for sure when another thruhiker confirmed. They left before seven. I stayed to eat breakfast and pack up. I didn't see them today at all. 
I vehemently dislike the summit of Washington so I blue blazed around the side and headed out into one of my least favorite sections of trail. It isn't difficult by length or elevation change, but it is tedious, painstaking hiking. The trail is all tippy rocks. Every step has to be planned and executed well. You have to plan a path keeping the next to cairns in mind so you don't go off course. I lost track of how many times I lost my balance and fell. Not badly, though. Mostly I caught myself on other rocks. 
When I got to Madison Hut at 3:30, I found that Safari had written in the register that she was going on to Osgood tentsite. No time mentioned. I stepped out and assessed the sky. It was a dark grey and both Madison and Adams were encased in cloud. It was starting to rain. I well know that the hike down Madison is a bitch - and certainly not to be attempted by a tired me in bad weather. 
Instead I got water and walked down the other side of the mountain to the Valley Way tentsite. I couldn't stomach the thought of staying in another hut tonight. The crowding, the noise, the schedule, the stupid skits.. oh god, the skits. Fortunately, unlike at Lakes of the Clouds, I had an alternative. It means a hike back up the mountain in the morning, but I'm home for the night. 
Of course, my home is trying to slide downhill, and I smell like a wet dog in a dirty litter box, but I guess it will do. I've hung a bear line, started my dinner cooking, and tried to level my sleeping pad as well as I can. Also, Ima drink my booze tonight. 
I have no idea when or if I'll see the other three again. Trail families tend to come and go. I like their company and love how hard we laugh together, but I will be fine with or without them.","Lakes of the Clouds hut

I woke up at five and immediately turned on the phone to check the forecast. My luck was in! All day chance of thunderstorms had turned into cloudy with chance of rain later. I started packing my sodden gear and tent. Unusually for me, I packed first, then ate breakfast. Which in this case was half a Greenbelly bar and a handful of vitamins downed with some caffeinated Mio-enhanced water. 
I started walking shortly before seven. The trip back up to the hut wasn't terribly fast. The trail is fairly overgrown, narrower than me with my pack on in many places. I started whacking the trees with my poles so they would shed their water on the ground, not on me. 
When I got up to the hut, I stepped in to use their bathroom and get more water, then I headed right up Madison. Visibility was extremely poor, with hikers appearing out of the mist as they neared me. Despite that, it was a very busy mountain. I think most went up just to bag the peak. 
As I neared the summit, the wind picked up until it was knocking me over. I had to wait for brief lulls to take more treacherous steps, and my poles were knocked out of my hands twice by the wind. It was really something. Right before I got to the top, a southbound hiker told me it was nearly still on the other side of the mountain, so I had something to look forward to. 
You may need help visualizing the mountain. In most places I've been, mountains have dirt and grass covering much of the area, with rocks poking through. Maybe large rocks. House sized boulders. But it's still recognizable as regular ground. Madison, on the other hand, appears to be the devil's own slag pile. As far as I can tell, it's rocks all the way down. Jagged rocks are piled haphazardly on top of each other.  You pick your way among them as best you can. Many have some lichen growing on them. If you pay attention to where the lichen is blurred and worn, you can see where others have stepped before you. There is no dirt. 
Once I reached the summit, I started my least favorite descent. The three mile steep downhill rock scramble was what ended my hike in 2014. It caused a compressed nerve problem that was incredibly painful and difficult to diagnose. So I was not looking forward to the descent. As expected, it went on and on, though I think it passed more quickly this year. 
Once I finally got below treeline, after hours of careful steps, the steep trail continued. But now there was dirt! I love dirt! It's so nice to step on.

I woke up still tired and aching all over. Madison really did a number on me yesterday. 
I packed up all my gear and went to the picnic table to eat with the others. I asked tentatively ""Did you hear somebody having sex last night?"" And the table erupted. Yes, everybody heard it. Apparently it happened twice but only woke me up once. We critiqued their performance (unimpressive) and considered clapping as they left, but refrained. 
I was pretty excited to do new AT miles today. Once we got past the pond, everything was fresh to me. And it will be for 90 miles or so!
Wildcat E was as hard as advertised. At one point I had to press myself up a crevice in a strength move using only my arms. I scrabbled to get purchase with my feet, slipping as they failed to grip the wet rock. Safari stayed with me while I did it. When I made it through, I was shaking from fatigue and reaction. I have no idea why maintainers haven't added rebar or steps to that crevice. 
The morning dragged on, as I forced legs that had started out tired to carry me up the mountain. My emotions were out of control. I was, in turn, sad, anxious, angry, depressed, resigned, confident, and calm. It was a real roller coaster in my head. At the worst I started crying, then had to stop and calm myself because I needed my airways clear for breathing. 
On peak D there was a picnic table next to the gondola station. I joined the others and put my head down on my arms. A nap would have been nice. 
Past the gondola Wildcat got a lot easier and less technical. Surprisingly, the last descent was entirely covered in really nice rock stairs. I sure wasn't expecting that! It made the last mile to the hut a pleasure. I also met Wild Child on that leg. She is also a repeat offender - AT 2014. We talked a bit about other trails we wanted to do. I liked her. Maybe I'll get lucky and see her again on my sobo section. 
Arriving at the hut, I found Safari staying for a work for stay, and Boss and Goddess heading out for a campsite a quarter mile away. I elected to camp as well. I grabbed some water and we headed back to the trail. 
The promised campsite did not materialize. We were forced to hike on to Carter Dome. Concerningly, the spring listed on the map was not in evidence either. I'll have to economize on water until we get to Imp campsite tomorrow. I had about 2.5 liters left when I got to camp. It's supposed to rain tomorrow so I hope to find seasonal water flowing. I found some today or I'd have been hurting coming down from Wildcat A. 
We set up our tents in a tiny stealth spot inside the tree line. I was enjoying my sleeping pad after the long day, but then it suddenly deflated. I had managed to puncture it with my trowel. Argh! I pulled out my repair kit and put a patch on it. The kit didn't have instructions so I had to wing it. I let it dry for about half an hour. It seems to be holding air. I guess I'll find out later tonight if my butt ends up on the ground. 
If terrain permits, I would really like to get to Rattle River tomorrow. That would leave us an easy two miles to the road the next day, with almost a whole day off. I really want that.","Pinkham Notch

For the record, the pad I punctured did not hold air. I slept in the most comfortable position given the topography of the campsite- the fetal position, curled on my right side. I tried adding tenacious tape this evening, but it didn't help and now I'm out of tenacious tape. I inflated the pad, but it deflated quickly. Safari lent me her sit pad to layer with my old, bedraggled gossamer gear pad, and I added my fleece top to the mix. Nevertheless I'm looking forward to getting a pad that holds air. 
This morning I had minimal desire to sleep in, as the ground started feeling cold around four AM. I packed up, ate a Luna bar, and was ready to go. Carter mountain was super pretty but had a surprise vertical descent. I slid on my butt, as per usual. I was pleased to find my pants still intact afterward. 
We got to Imp Campsite/Shelter at two and decided to carry on to the Kenduskeag trail where the topo map made it look like there were camping opportunities, but it was a bog there so we kept walking. Boss and Goddess flew to the shelter. I plodded. I had hurried up Mount Moriah as best I could, beating a thunderstorm, but that did me in. I kept walking, right knee protesting. Another storm came. I was happy to be at lower elevation, but the storm was very flash-bangy anyway. It hailed pea size hail on me. The trail flooded and got slippery, slowing me even further. 
For the last two miles I was sure I must hit the shelter any second. Finally I got to the .25 mile warning / forest protection area sign, and immediately had to cross the flooded Rattle River twice. Finding a safe place to cross was super fun. I double bagged my phone in case I went in the drink, and unclipped my pack straps. I crossed uneventfully. 
I finally hove up to the shelter and everybody cheered. Apparently they were going to come look for me. And what if I had camped a mile away? But they didn't have to. 
I first tried taping my pad (while drinking caramel flavor vodka because damn that was a crappy evening) then changed into my wool long underwear. My standards of modesty were obliterated by the pouring rain. I changed in front of utter strangers and couldn't be pressed to care. 
I ate some jerky and gorp and called it dinner. I'm not looking forward to my night on the shelter floor, but I am definitely looking forward to a nearo tomorrow. Here's to showering, laundry, town food, and whatever the heck Walmart has to offer in the way of sleeping pads.","Carter Dome

A firefly spent much of the night flashing his signal against the shelter ceiling. Pretty, but I don't think he'll find a mate in there. 
I woke up for the final time after many night time wakenings, sore from sleeping on my super thin pad. Goddess was packing things up. I packed my (hole-y) sleeping pad and my sleeping bag, then with much distaste put on my wet clothes from yesterday. You know the Mr Yuck face on the poison sign? That's the face I made. 
Safari couldn't wait to see Le Chef so she left first. I took time to eat a little bit and take my vitamins. Boss and Goddess left as I was finishing my packing. I made more faces as I put on wet socks and shoes. I brushed my teeth and I was ready to go. 
The two miles went super fast, both in measured time and in experienced time. Almost immediately I was walking into the hostel, shedding my clothes, and taking a shower. Bliss! Also a little scary when I looked in the mirror. The chafing around my armpits is horrible. Not sure if it's the heat, long hours of hiking, or walking in soaked clothes from the torrential rain. Or all three. Or something else entirely. I hope the short day today lets it heal some. 
As soon as we were all clean, Le Chef arrived and we went into Gorham for breakfast. Welsh's was super slow but the food was good and plentiful. I demolished a ham and tomato grilled cheese. 
Next door was an outfitter. I replenished my supply of Tenacious Tape and looked at the sleeping pads. I decided to check Walmart before deciding. All the options were either heavy (various old school Thermarests) or bulky (foam pads). 
Despite Safari's distaste for the place, we next visited Walmart. The sleeping pads there were even worse. I bought food to get me to Andover, though. I was excited to find the cheese and spinach tortellini that I love. I've looked for them in the last three towns with no success. 
On the way back through town, Le Chef stopped outside the outfitter again so I could bop in to buy a Thermarest. At 22 oz it's the heaviest pad I've carried in years. And the thinnest. I bet it's way more comfortable than my minuscule sit pad, though. (BTW one of the Sierra Club folks in the Presidentials called hers a sit-upon. Haven't heard that term in years!)
Back at the hostel, I packaged food for five days. I'm taking advantage of the generosity of Safari and Le Chef by leaving some items in their vehicle over this next stretch. I'll use some of it for my Andover resupply, and some I'll probably send home. Taking supplements, repair gear, and couple of other things out of my pack will more than make up for the heavier sleeping pad. 
I was clumsily rolling the Thermarest up after inflating it and Safari couldn't take it. She made me hand it over so she could show me how to put my knee on it while rolling it so it will compress down to a small package. I hadn't used a self inflating pad in so long that I'd lost the knack. 
I ordered a new hip belt for my pack. When I got the new pack, I ordered the next size down hip belt. It's already pulled as tight as it will go. I imagine I'll need an even smaller one in a month or so. At some point I'll reach the  limit of the width of my pelvis, right?
Despite knowing that Mahoosuc Notch and Mahoosuc Arm are waiting for me, I'm excited to be heading into Maine.  It's not easy hiking, but it's so beautiful I don't care.","Rattle River Shelter

At one point today Safari passed me and said she liked what I wrote in the register at Carter Notch Hut. It was ""It's not a moral failure to be slow. Nor to be weak. Nor to understand your limitations. Giving up when you feel that you fail in comparison to others is a moral failure.""
I was discombobulated this morning. I couldn't find my spare bandanna or my water reservoir. I did eventually find them but I had this floundering feeling. 
Walking away from the hostel I realized I had forgotten my fanny pack. Seriously?! That's ridiculous. I waved the others on and went back in to find it. I had taken it off to stretch, as it turns out. 
The day started out pretty and easy. It sucked me in, then hit me hard with unblazed steep rocks. Then I realized that I had miscalculated and it was a twelve mile day, not a ten mile day. I tried to text the others not to worry if I didn't make it but the text wouldn't go through. I got water at a stream so I could dry camp, but no camp site showed up. Eventually I ended up at the shelter after all. Hurrah!
Tomorrow we're going 9.6 so we're staged for a short but tough day through Mahoosuc Notch. Can't wait! Sort of. 
My headphones died in a most unpleasant way mid morning. They started randomly quitting and starting. And fast forwarding.  That was the worst part. So I put my phone on speaker in my fanny pack and listened to tunes that way. My apologies to any woodland creatures who don't like Nat King Cole. Or the Lumineers.","Gorham

This is not fun. 
Over twelve hours of hiking to cover 9.6 difficult, dangerous miles. No time to rest. The views in no way make up for this. We're exhausted and beat up. Nobody is enjoying it in our group. The consensus today was that if there had been a way to get off the trail in the middle of the day, we would have. 
But there wasn't and there won't be for a couple of days. Tomorrow is Mahoosuc Notch and the Arm. The day after we pass Grafton Notch. I've been told it gets better after that. 
I seriously miss the sort of trail that is just tiring. Not continuously life threatening. 
We've been facing increasingly difficult trail since Moosilauke. I don't know how long ago that was. It feels like a year. I know it can't go on forever, because I know that the trail north of Oquossoc is not awful. Hard, yes, but not awful. 
In addition to my negative feelings about the day, I got sucked into a bog up to my crotchety today. It was difficult crawling out. My pants are filthy and smell awful. Additionally, the seam in the seat gave way in the last mile. I didn't even care. I apologized to Old Man Jameson behind me for what he might see, and I kept walking. I didn't even change out of them when I got to camp. I just did camp chores. And a group of scouts showed up. In fact an hour later they're still cooking in front of the shelter. I did at least go behind the shelter to change into my pajamas, but boys kept walking by so whatever. 
Goddess offered to sew my pants up tomorrow. I took her up on it. She's undoubtedly better at it than I am. I'm pretty sure I want to wear intact pants through the Notch.","Gentian Pond Shelter

We woke up late this morning, on purpose. We were all SO tired and some of us were dispirited. So a late, slow morning was called for. 
I had an incipient migraine so I took meds for it. They helped, but they also leach my energy, which is not ideal. 
I awoke to find that the kids had put their dirty dishes in the bear box, coating everything in slime. Also one of the little fsckers had put couscous in the bag of mulch in the privy. WTF? The leader slept in the shelter, and when he awoke picked up a novel and started reading it while the kids were unsupervised. Unbelievable. 
Anyway, the four of us left and walked together over the first mountain and through Mahoosuc Notch. It took about three hours. It would have been far more enjoyable without packs, based on the times I took mine off to fit through a tight space. As it was, it was a lot of work. 
At the end we sat down to have a snack, and Lucky offered a celebratory sip of Jack Daniels, which was fabulous. 
When I got up to water a tree, I found that my pants seam now sported a 4"" tear. I don't think these pants are going all the way to Katahdin. Fortunately I spent the afternoon without anybody walking behind me. 
We headed up the Arm. In my head it was a mile and a half of tilted slab, but it was more giant bouldery than that. It suited me well. There is a particular sort of hill that makes you go up slowly enough that legs and lungs never get overly stressed. This was that sort of hill. Best part of my day, really. 
Finally at the shelter, I set up on a group tent platform with the others. I spent some time sewing the pants. I want to put a patch over the seam but I got tired so if the seam hasn't blown out again by tomorrow evening, maybe I'll do it then. 
Tomorrow we get to Grafton Notch. I sure hope it gets easier after that, as it is rumored to.","Full Goose Shelter

That Thermarest is not my favorite thing. It cost over $100, it doesn't actually self inflate, and I keep waking up with my bottom arm fallen asleep. I will be thrilled when my Klymit pad reaches me. It isn't insulated but I definitely don't lose the feeling in any extremities when I sleep on it. 
Anywho. 
I woke up, shrugged into my hiking clothes, and packed up. My dental floss seam repair seemed all right. I then hiked back to New Hampshire for water. It's annoying to go so far for water, especially on rocky terrain. But at least it was available. The others got started hiking as I went about my morning chores of filtering water, brushing my teeth, stretching, and using the privy. 
So when I headed up the mountain, it was alone. I was unsurprised to find more slab requiring crawling on hands and feet, climbing up root systems, and in one case inchworming my way onto the rock. Surprisingly Old Speck was more forgiving on the north side. The hike down was pleasant. 
At Grafton Notch I found Hydro giving out trail magic. I got an icy cold Pepsi and some Hostess cakes. We sat at a picnic table and Safari suggested slackpacking the next four days. I don't think the words were all the way out of her mouth before I agreed. Plus it meant stopping for the day at noon today! I feel and move like I'm ninety at the moment, so an afternoon off sounded like heaven. 
We drove to Andover and got a room with five twin beds in it, which was perfect. Or at least functional. My standards may be lower than others. Pine Ellis, for $25, provides a bed, shower, and laundry. That's a pretty great deal. We walked over to the Little Red Hen for burgers that we've been thinking about for days. Then across the street for ice cream cones and some snacks for slackpacking. That pretty much exhausts the possibilities of Andover. 
I sewed the patch onto my pants seat. Tomorrow I'll find out if it's comfortable to hike in. If so I'll skip getting new pants sent. No point letting Maine eat another pair.","Speck Pond

I'm so in love with Baldpate Mountain! It's gorgeous. It has a dip in the middle that lets you clearly see hikers from the other peak, which is fun. But given how much of it is steeply slanting rock, I sure wouldn't want to do it in the rain. Fortunately, the weather today was perfect. Blue skies and puffy white clouds perfect. Comfy hiking temperature perfect. 
We woke up at our usual early time in the hostel. Safari got coffee for us to caffeinate while we were still in our room. We were packed and out before six. At 5:58 we were sitting in front of the general store, waiting for it to open at 6. We trooped in for breakfast. Unfortunately one person had to handle the entire store so we didn't get food until 6:40. But it was damn good food. I can't even describe to you the omelet that I had. I will remember it fondly. 
Le Chef dropped us off a bit late as a consequence. My lower back was in spasm so the others quickly disappeared into the distance as my left leg ached and I walked slowly. The muscles in my back slowly warmed up. By the time I got to Baldpate Lean-to, it had relaxed enough to try adjusting it. I got it to crack in two spots, and the feeling of pressure on my leg immediately decreased. Score!
As soon as I reached the treeline on Baldpate I was overcome with joy. It was so pretty! I nearly had that gorgeous mountain to myself, too. It was a wonderful moment. 
On the north side it got a little steep. I didn't fall but my pace fell off as I carefully stepped down the mountain. I felt that I was challenging the traction level of my shoes. It took a long time to get far enough down that I felt I could take normal steps safely. 
At Frye Notch Lean-to, Safari was just finishing a break when I got there. Lucky was also sitting on the shelter edge. I got some water from the brook. They left as I was filtering and eating snacks. 
Coming down the next hill, I found Lucky just after a fall. We walked together and chatted for the next four miles. She is a really nice and interesting woman. She also seems to be keeping our pace so I hope to see her some more. We stopped to gawp at Dunn Falls, then continued up the trail. I had misread the book and thought my day ended downhill so the up was an unpleasant surprise. But at long last I hove up to the truck where everybody else was waiting. I hate being the slowest! Not much I can do about it, though. 
Le Chef had bought spaghetti makings. I requested a brief stop at the store to pick up breakfast and some wine to go with the spaghetti. I was also able to contribute some Parmesan cheese from my food bag. It was quite the pleasant dinner. We're set up in a campground near Andover. It's a little sketchy and full of mosquitoes, but it's affordable and conveniently located, so there's that. 
Tomorrow we plan to try to get hiking early so we can get to the post office before it closes. My hiking speed is definitely the weakest link here. I can't hurry too much or I start falling. Wish me luck that the terrain is compatible with good hiking speed.","Grafton Notch

I heard Goddess start rustling around at 4:30. I desperately wanted more sleep, but I knew I had to get up so we could get on the trail early. At least I didn't have to pack the tent. And it wasn't raining yet. 
I turned on the phone to check the weather and saw that it might not rain until noon. Score!
I ate my cinnamon roll from the Andover general store. It was delicious. After brushing my teeth I was ready to go. We all hopped into the truck. I think we got to the trail at 6:10. Not bad!
The miles passed by very quickly. For one thing, the terrain was far more gentle than it was a few days ago. For another, I remembered an audiobook that I had in my Kindle App. I put it on and let it carry me away to a world where magic is real and women are sassy. 
I arrived at the Hall Mountain Lean-to and realized I needed to use the privy. The sign indicated it was just down the trail, but it was more than a little distance. I declined to hike back to the shelter, so after my visit I kept going. I found a nice sitting rock on the trail half an hour later and stopped there instead. 
I was oddly unhungry today. Safari suggests that the lower calorie requirements of slackpacking may be the cause. I had lots of snacks left over, at any rate. 
When I summited the last mountain I texted Le Chef to let him know I thought I'd be at the road at 3. I really go there at 2:30, which was nifty except it meant a half hour wait in the rain. I zipped everything up as well as I could and sat down to wait. Pogo showed up similarly half an hour early for his shuttle. We chatted until his ride from Pine Ellis showed up. 
Le Chef arrived right at three and I was grateful to see him. We went back to the campground where I took a hot shower. I realized that I left my crocs in the tent so I showered barefoot. I expect athletes foot any minute now. 
Immediately afterward, Safari, Le Chef and I went to the general store in Andover to eat dinner. It was tasty but I couldn't finish it. I'll have leftovers for breakfast. 
Back in my tent I had to spend several minutes killing mosquitoes before I could take off my protective gear. This location really is exceptionally buggy. It's the worst I've experienced on the trail. Every time I open the tent mesh, a few get in. 
It's raining this evening. It's cozy in my tent, despite the mosquito corpses. I want to get as much sleep as I can to make up for last night's deficit.  In a few minutes I'll shut off the phone and see if I can drift off into stinky hiker dreamland.","East B Hill Rd

I finished the Appalachian Trail today. 
I mean, not in the ""I'm done! Time to resume my life!"" sense. In the ""I've hiked all of the trail at least once"" sense. There will be no new miles. 
I woke this morning a little on the tired side. I packed up my tent and then ate leftover pizza, leaving one more piece for lunch. It had rained vigorously overnight, so Safari kindly put out a dry towel for me to sit on at our picnic table. 
I hoisted my borrowed daypack and set out on the trail after Le Chef dropped us off. After the other three passed me, I didn't see them again today. It was pleasant to hike along, listening to an audiobook and walking at my own pace. The trail was slippery after yesterday's rain. I stepped carefully, slipping a few times but not falling. 
A German sobo passed me and spoke of trail magic ahead if I hurried. With no desire to sprint, I assumed they would be gone when I got there. And they were - but there was trail magic left behind with my name on it! Snowman left me a note and a paper plate with two bananas, a powdered donut, and a hot dog. And an icy cold coke. The hot dog was still hot! They left minutes before I got there. My friends were responsible, of course. 
I sat and ate and drank and was thankful. Pogo arrived as I was finishing the coke. I gave him the remaining banana. He was distraught at missing the full trail magic, having run down the mountain to get there. He ate half the banana, saving the other half for Frog, who arrived moments later. 
Telling people about trail magic ahead tends to lead to crushing disappointment when they get there too late. 
After I arrived at the road I texted the others. Le Chef drove up moments later and whisked me back to the campsite at the Rangeley State Park. I set up my tent, then fetched my box to sort through it. I broke the news that I wasn't slackpacking tomorrow. My plan is to go into town for a day off, while the others proceed north. I wish them well, but I don't want to follow their schedule. They have reasons to get to Katahdin faster than me. They're almost at the end, an exciting time. I'm approaching the middle. They'll rest after they're done. That's months away for me. 
It was weird to sit together for perhaps the last time. I shared that I had completed the trail today, and we toasted. I'll miss these people. We've shared so much laughter and so much difficult trail. It forms a strong bond. I expect the first few days to be a little glum until I get used to being solo again.","South Arm Rd

Today was a little sad. I said goodbye to everybody at our drop off point. I got a little teary. I know I'll see them again but it feels different, not making our plans together. 
My pack weighed a million pounds. You lose strength quickly if you don't keep doing exercise that demands it. Just three days of slackpacking and putting the pack back on was so hard! Of course, there was extra load as I am carrying some items that I'll mail in Rangeley. 
I had forgotten some of the trickier parts of today's hike. Just as well I guess. In my head it was an easy stroll from Rangeley to Oquossoc. But there were several boulder jumbles to navigate, ledge to climb, and lots and lots of mud and roots. Typical Maine. But fairly easy trail for all that. I did in one day what I did in three in 2014. 
I ran into Pogo at Sabbath Day Pond Shelter. We seem to be keeping similar schedules. Of course, I'm taking tomorrow off so I may never see him again. 
At the road I walked .3 up to the Hiker Hut to get my packages. For another $5 they agreed to shuttle me to town. While I was waiting, Pogo asked me if I knew G Hippie. I was so confused. Could there be two G Hippies in the world? Why would he be asking about a hiker from seven years ago? Turns out G Hippie was doing trail magic!  I missed him at the trailhead, but caught up with him at the Hiker Hut. It was good to see his face. 
Another hiker told me where I might be able to find a sleeping pad in town. I checked into the Rangeley Inn, showered, then made a beeline for that outfitter. NeoAir in hand, I next found a restaurant. I tried the Asian fusion place but they said they were backed up, running out of things, and not taking more orders. Instead I went to the Forks in the Air Bistro. Everything on the menu looked good. With difficulty I decided on a Fat Tire, carrot ginger cream soup, and baked mussels with bacon and almonds and all sorts of good stuff. It was all excellent. After eating so much hiker food, this high falutin' fare fed both my stomach and my soul. 
There was an ice cream shop on the way back to the Inn so I stopped on for a soft serve cone. A minute after I started licking it, my ice cream fell out of the cone. I caught it in my hand, shrugged, and jammed it back into the cone. Luckily I had brought napkins, but it was still a bit messy. It tasted delicious.

Holy kadiddlehoppers, it was good to sleep in a real bed. In a room by myself. A CLEAN room. With my very own CLEAN bathroom. To get up, I just sat up and put my feet on the floor. No levering myself up and crawling awkwardly through a tiny door shorter than a hobbit's. 
I kept checking the time, seeing that it wasn't morning yet, and blissfully rolling back into slumber. Eventually it started getting close to seven, which is when breakfast starts, so I got up. The ""continental breakfast"" was not a croissant and a coffee. It was a very nice buffet. A roasted tomato and feta frittata, a toasted bagel, a scone, fresh fruit and yogurt... I don't see how this can be called a continental breakfast. Not that I'm complaining. 
I went and grabbed my dirty laundry. I walked to the Villsge Scrubboard nearby, and was sad to find out that it is closed on Thursdays. I kept walking. I needed some things at the IGA. Mostly pharmacy things, but there is no pharmacy here. On the way a vehicle pulled over. The F bombs! They decided to do a short day due to incoming severe weather. They invited me to the library with them but I stuck with my IGA plan. 
I pondered getting this bullseye type rash checked out. I think the shape is due to the location (armpit chafing) rather than a tick bite. I haven't found a tick biting me since April. I feel absolutely fine, barring thruhike wear and tear. I decided to get cortisone cream instead, and keep a wary eye out for symptoms. It's not like I wouldn't recognize them at this point. 
I finally found unscented trash compactor bags at the store. It came in a pack of four so I texted the others to see if they wanted them. They did. I met them in town and handed them bags, then they got moving, and I assume they hiked the two miles out to the shelter after that. 
Returning to my room, I worked up a sweat and possibly turned the air blue with curses as I replaced the hip belt on my pack. That was *hard*. I don't look forward to swapping it again later. 
Given the laundromat situation I tried rinsing my clothes in the sink. It sort of worked, but I never did get the water to run clean from my socks. I suppose if they're hideous after they dry, I can launder them tomorrow. I'd get out of town pretty late, but I could do it. 
Next I had to sort out what I was mailing ahead and what I was mailing home. I really wanted a nap instead but it had to be done. At least I could nosh on the crusty bread and Brie that I picked up at the IGA. 
I eventually got to the point where I could lie down, but my head kept telling me I would oversleep and miss the post office hours, so I gave up and carried all my parcels down to the post office to ship them. On the way back, I stopped in at a different outfitter and found a ball cap that might be cooler to wear than the boonie hat I've been using. The boonie hat was important in keeping the mesh netting off my neck in bad bug season, but that's over now. I figure I'll carry both to Stratton and see how I like the ball cap. 
I stopped again for ice cream. Don't judge me. 
I ate at the tavern that's attached to the motel tonight. It was perfect. Shrimp the size of my fist, perfectly cooked squash, toasted giant couscous, and tostones. I've spent a ton of money on food here and it's been worth every penny. Three months of hiker food is a long time, y'all. 
I tried turning on the tv for entertainment. It turns out that I'm still not interested. Maybe I'll read a book on my kindle app?","Rangeley

Saddleback Mountain is so pretty! My previous traverse happened in rain and whiteout fog. I could barely see cairn to cairn, and the hike took on a nightmarish quality as I walked alone, interminably. I saw no other hikers that day until I reached the summit and found four hikers there. 
Today the weather was clear and cool. I could see for miles in all directions. I could see mountains I had hiked, mountains I would hike, lakes all around, and very few signs of humans. It was glorious. I paused often to drink it in. I saw a couple dozen shiny happy people, as drunk on the beauty of it as I was. 
But first.. I woke up in my comfortable bed in the Rangeley Inn and didn't want to leave. I told myself to sleep until breakfast time, which is what I did. Breakfast was better than yesterday, because the three cheese frittata tasted better than the tomato and feta one. And today's blueberry scones were delicious. 
My aching knees carried me back up the stairs. The phrase ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here"" applied. The town would soon be crowded with Clint Black fans and his entourage. I knew the motel was booked. I had to leave my room. 
I packed everything, corralled my detritus as well as I could, and left a tip for the maid. My pack with its smaller and lighter sleeping bag and pad, and significantly less food, felt good! Carrying it felt natural, as opposed to the huge burden it had been walking into town. I felt a little better about going. I still wanted another day off, but it was clear that today would be beautiful - a good day to be in the woods. 
I dropped my key in the box at the front door, walked across the street, and stuck my thumb out. I wasn't thirty seconds after I stepped outside the Inn that I had a ride. A voice called out from a car, ""Mrs Joy!"" Terry from the Town and Country motel was shuttling Halfway back to the trail. I hadn't known he was in town. I had assumed he was well ahead of me. 
He said that he had spent three days in town. I didn't ask why, figuring he would tell me if he wanted me to know. It was good to see his face, though. Even better to do so as I rode back to the trail. 
I still wasn't feeling it by the time I got to Piazza Rock Shelter. I stopped there to use the privy and tighten my shoe laces. A sleepy head was somehow still in a sleeping bag, despite a horde of children loudly playing tag nearby. She woke soon, and I got to meet River Otter - a kindred soul, I think. We chatted for a bit. After a while I said ""I'm feeling super motivated today."" Straight faced, she said ""I can tell. You seem obsessive about it. I was getting worried. "" It felt good to laugh. After a little more conversation, I shouldered my pack and continued north. 
Then I ran into the beauty of Saddleback and my motivation reappeared. 
After crossing the Horn and descending, I assessed the time and decided to stop at this campsite. It felt weird to stop so early. It was just five when I set up my tent. I'm not exhausted, I had plenty of time and energy to fetch water, hang my bear line, and make dinner. It's been weeks since I felt like that after a day of hiking. Physically, I could have continued to the next shelter. But I'm glad I stopped. This feels nice. 
A little quiet and lonely, but nice. 
Tomorrow I should get started a couple of hours earlier, seeing as how I won't be having frittata. 
At 7 pm I'm in my jammies in my tent. Now that I have my nice light sleeping bag, I'm of course worried that I won't be warm enough. My 20 degree bag was so puffy and obviously warm that it was reassuring. Of course, I was uncomfortably warm and sweaty in it. But I was very confident that it could handle anything. It will take a night or two of not freezing for me to feel comfortable with this one again.","Rangeley

The hike up Saddleback Junior was pretty. It was still early morning when I reached its summit. The view wasn't as pretty as from the main peak, but it was still pretty good. 
The day passed uneventfully. Orbeton stream was the one I remembered. 
I thought fondly of Sarge, Weaver, and Gardener as I hiked. We shared this trail in 2011. I glanced at the logging road where we camped. It's completely grown over now. 
There was some unexpectedly easy trail today, interspersed with more Maine-ish hiking. I grew tired in the afternoon, which was worrying until I realized that ten hours of hiking would be enough to tire most people. Even slow hiking like I do. 
I felt a bit lonely at the shelter, but I talked to other hikers and they dispelled the loneliness. We talked about grad school, woodchucks, red meat allergy, and other things. Somebody made a fire. I enjoyed the waves of heat rolling off it. For the most part I live in a non-temperature-controlled environment these days. Heat on a chilly evening sure is nice. 
I'm one of few who didn't camp tonight. Not sure why, as the shelter is nice enough and there are no bugs. 
Tomorrow remains a mystery. 6 miles to Crocker Cirque or 13 miles to town. Neither seems ideal. I need to do laundry in town. I mean, I'd really like to. I would need to stay in town late the morning after I got there after a 13 mile day. I guess I'll just see how tomorrow goes. I think I'd rather hike a short day into town. But sometimes my legs keep going, despite me.","Redington Campsite

I sort of miss being dehydrated. In southern Maine the terrain was so hard that I sweated constantly. Despite drinking a lot I remained in a fairly constant state of dehydration. I barely peed at all. No getting up at night. No particular urgency in the morning. It was nice, if unhealthy. 
Now I'm in much easier terrain. My body knows what to do with it. And I'm back to getting up during the night, dangit. Last night I nearly took a fall trying to navigate away from the shelter using the stupid red light on my headlamp. It's almost worse than useless. I have no depth perception with it. I can barely see the ground at all, let alone get over rocks safely. 
I longed to be camped alone so I wouldn't need to be careful with my headlamp or go so far away from camp. I like company, mostly, and the feeling of safety in numbers. And I like having a water source and a privy and all that jazz. But sometimes a girl just wants to be by herself. 
Tonight I'm camped alone. All I hear is the wind in the trees and the chirping of birds. It's rather pleasant. 
Although dinner didn't agree with me. At least if I have to holler New York later, I'll do it without an audience. 
I found out today that what I remembered as Orbeton Stream was really the Carrabasset River. Embarrassing! The whole time I've been thinking that Inchworm disappeared in the wrong place. 
I got to Crocker Cirque around one and was nowhere near ready to stop for the day. I didn't think I would make it to Stratton tonight, nor did I really want to. It's supposed to rain tomorrow so I didn't want to head into the Bigelows. But I didn't want to stay two nights in town. This way I can spend most of the rainy day getting chores done, then walk out in the morning. 
Btw the camouflage pattern of my tent works against me with mosquitoes. The only way I can tell they're in here is when they move.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

I slept so well last night! I was surprised to wake up at 7:20. That's very late for me, lately. I didn't even do anything. I just lay there enjoying. The air felt warm and moist. I was snug in my sleeping bag. I could hear birds singing. The sun was streaming down. 
Eventually I got my food bag, ate my last honeybun, and packed up. My pack felt delightfully light, with virtually no food and only a liter of water. I started walking down the mountain to the road. Soon I found a lovely ""2000"" on the ground made out of birch branches with bright green leaves filling the zeroes. And soon after that I found a blaze with 2000 scratched into it. Another hiker was gluing heart shaped sorrel leaves to the blaze when I got there. 
At the road I immediately started walking west. There isn't much traffic on the road to Stratton on a Monday morning, and most of it was heavy trucks. About a mile in, a man pulled over on the other side of the road to ask if I wanted a ride. It was Willie Nelson. The trailname, sadly, not the actual singer. He asked if I had met his friend Oneismus, and I was happy to report that I had. Soon he dropped me off in Stratton. 
The White Wolf wasn't open yet so I went to Fotter's for groceries. I bought too much food to eat in town. Soon I had a room, a shower, and a burger in my belly. As I was leaving the restaurant, the owner shouted ""Have a nice nap!"" ""Wow"" I said. ""You really know hikers.""
But first I walked down to the laundromat to wash my stinky clothes. THEN I took a nap. 
I have food, fuel, clean clothes, and a full belly. I'm ready to tackle the Bigelows.","North Crocker stealth site

It was very pleasant to be indoors in the rain. I was a bit overfull. I may have been too diligent with my town eating efforts. I lay in bed, resembling a beached whale. Have we ever checked with beached whales to see if overeating was the cause?
I thoroughly enjoyed sleeping in an actual bed. It was nice to have walls. And hot running water. And air conditioning. I was digging all of it. 
I didn't get up super early, either. My plan was to camp at the col in the Bigelows, and it wasn't a long walk. My morning routine was slightly stymied by a microwave cable too short to reach an outlet. Useless! And no way to make coffee. Also the breakfast pastry I had purchased was fairly awful. But it satisfied my hunger, so good enough. But I unpacked the piece of it I had put in my backpack and replaced it with a bagel. 
After some leisurely packing and tooth brushing, I walked out to the road to try to hitch back to the trail. Stratton is pretty dead in the morning, it seems. I stood by the empty street a while, then gave up and walked over to the Stratton motel, where I asked about shuttles. Five dollars got me back to the trail quickly. 
I wasn't really feeling it today. I was a little queasy and tired. But the weather was nice, and I got happier the farther uphill I got. 
Mid-hike doldrums are common. I need to find some entertainment- a book or the like. I still want to do this hike, but I've reached the less motivated, more tired stage. Luckily I've also reached an area of easier terrain. It'll be nice to stretch my legs a little. 
Tonight I'm camped next to a woman doing her first solo hike. How very cool! I know it's a little scary and intimidating the first time. She's backpacked a lot, just not on her own. She seemed to be doing just fine to me. I congratulated her on her accomplishment. 
I'm looking forward to tomorrow morning. Little Bigelow mountain is very pretty to me, as is the view from Avery Peak. Not sure where I'll end the day. I have plenty of food, as usual, so anywhere my legs take me is fine.","Stratton

This morning was pleasant. I chatted with Audrey and petted Julius. The dog was ridiculously adorable. He stepped into my little tent with me. I'm not sure if it was to get more petting or just to see what it looked like. I started taking the tent down, and just as he had done to Audrey's last night, he stepped on the collapsed tent. When I told him to move, he sat and looked at me. I shouldn't have laughed, but I did. Audrey says she thinks he's maybe a greyhound / Great Dane cross. She adopted him as a puppy from a shelter where he was advertised as a pit bull mix. Boy, did they ever guess that one wrong. He's a long, lean dog. His sense of humor reminds me of some pit bulls I've met, though. 
I asked Audrey what her trailname was. She didn't have one, but her roller derby name was Audzilla. I thought that was the best thing I'd ever heard and begged her to make it her trailname. She looked like maybe she'd do it. Audzilla!
Leaving camp, I climbed the boulder field leading up to Avery Peak. I stopped at the boxed spring for water. I noted it had a nice new hinged lid. And nice cold water. 
I had the summit to myself. An early morning beautiful summit all to myself. It was utterly gorgeous. 
I descended to Safford Notch where I met sobo Johnnie Sunshine. I sat and talked with him for a while before continuing on my way. He said there was no water until the next shelter, but I soon met No Hurry and Dolittle at a small spring. I gathered two liters of water, glad to know I'd have fresh cold water for lunch. 
As soon as I found a good sitting rock, I stopped to eat. It was basically the same lunch as yesterday, but today it didn't sit right. My belly swelled and hurt. I tried finding a place to lie down, which often helps, but today it didn't do much. I decided to stop at this shelter, despite my minimal mileage. It took me a long slow way to get here, stopping often to sit on boulders. 
I set up my tent to escape mosquitoes and to keep my ickiness to myself, in case I have something communicable. Probably it's just my weird biology. But you never know. 
Thunder has been rumbling since I was at the summit of Little Bigelow. So far no actual rain has fallen. I'm torn between being in the mood for rain and not wanting to take down a wet tent. Not that my preference matters, of course.","Avery Memorial Campsite

How did it get to be August? It was just April a few days ago. 
I woke up feeling meh. Belly still kind of hurt and I had a runny nose. I considered staying at the lean-to today, but my site had a root running through it at hip level. And the mosquitoes were already out. Moodily I sat up and started dressing. At least it was warm enough not to be uncomfortable while I switched from my wool long underwear to my daytime clothes. 
Unusually for me, I packed everything and struck the tent before getting my food down from the tree. My pack is oversized for its current load. I've scrunched it down as small as I can and put the brain inside, but a smaller pack would carry better right now. However it will be just right in another month and change when temperatures start to drop and I want my warmer gear back. 
For breakfast I decided on all liquids due to my belly, but also high protein. I had reviewed my last few days of nutrition and realized I hadn't been getting enough. I pulled out my one remaining breakfast smoothie and made that (berry flavor) and drank iced, or at least chilly, coffee with my vitamins. 
Not Yet joined me at the shelter for breakfast. He was nice to talk to - low key and soothing to my grumpy morning self. Sadly I'll probably never see him again. He won't hit the south for a couple more months, and I hope to start south from Harpers Ferry in early September, weather permitting. 
The walk to West Carry Pond shelter was gentle. And steamy. I can tell it's hot out when I can wring sweat out of the hankie I use to wipe my face.
I ran into Singing Sister and Mister Blister on my way. They're working on finishing their second section hike of the trail and they were pretty close to having achieved it. I wished them well as they continued south. 
It started thundering fairly suddenly while I was still miles from the shelter. Not your quiet rumble. It was a full on earth shattering roar. I was glad to be deep in the woods. I could barely even see the sky through the trees. It kept up until I got to the shelter. I ate a snack and waited to see what it was going to do. A downpour didn't seem to be imminent. I packed up and started walking north to try to find camping near East Carry Pond. 
Shortly after I left the shelter I was passed by a group of at least a dozen scouts headed for the shelter and I knew I had chosen right. I'm glad they're camping but I'd just as soon spend the night somewhere I can change my clothes without worrying about permanently damaging the psyche of impressionable youth. 
I found a spectacular stealth site and put up my tent at five. I grabbed a couple of liters of water from the pond. It's full of little green bits that I sincerely hope my filter will remove. I shoved everything into the tent and dove in after it just as the heavens opened up. I give myself an A+ for timing tonight. 
I hope my timing is as good tomorrow. The ferry crossing the Kennebec only runs until two pm. If I can't get there by then I'll have to cool my heels until the following morning.","Little Bigelow Lean-To

It took me a little while to settle in my stealth site last night. I lay there learning the sounds of the woods around me. The loons sounding from the pond, the squirrels chittering, ravens cawing hoarsely, and mystery thumping sounds that probably weren't moose. The rain falling on my tent helped. As long as my tent isn't leaking, the white noise of raindrops against the roof is very soothing to me. 
I knew I wanted to wake up early. I was aiming for 5. At about 4:20 (according to what's left of my watch) I rolled over for a few more minutes. Minutes stretched to an hour. At 5:20 I jerked awake. It was light out! Time to get moving! I changed clothes quickly and packed everything. I struck the tent and moved my pack and poles next to a large rock by the pond to eat breakfast. 
I had cold coffee and a raspberry cream whoopie pie. The pie was excellent. A little smooshed but tasty. I made the coffee with extra instant. Since I couldn't find packets in Stratton, I'm carrying a ziplock with instant coffee in it, which means the amount is up to me. And when it's up to me, the answer is MOAR CAFFEINE PLS. 
Also making my coffee cold saves me a ton of time. No setup time for the stove, no boiling time, and no careful sipping so I don't burn myself. Win win win. 
I reserved some of the water I fetched last night in case of need, but I drank only water I already had. Even staring at it, I couldn't tell if the floaters were animal or vegetable. I didn't even like the idea of them being caught in my filter. I got by all right with my remaining good water from yesterday. It was totally fogged in. I liked the eerie Stephen King feel it gave the place. I was less crazy about the condensation on my tent and the moisture dropping off of the small trees and bushes crowding the trail. My clothes were quickly soaked. It was nice that the drops highlighted the morning spiderwebs, but I caught enough single strands on my face to put my mosquito net on first thing. I've never gotten over the icky feeling of spiderweb on my face. I can handle it on my arms and legs. But not the face. Yech.
Today was very rooty and those roots were slippery as all heck. I did my best to step between them. It slowed me down some, but not critically. I reached Pierce Pond at 10 and had a mosquitoey snack. I got to the Kennebec Ferry before 1. Plenty of time! It took a little time for the ferryman to come get me and the other three hikers waiting. I determined that I am not super comfortable in a canoe anymore. My reactions are all wrong. Most of my experience with sitting on moving objects has to do with horses. They don't move like boats at all. To me it felt like the canoe kept dropping a shoulder and was probably going to spook or buck. 
I walked up to the Caratunk B&B. It's closer to the trail than the Sterling Inn, which pretty much made the decision for me. Im glad I came here, though. Paul and Boulder are friendly and welcoming. The building is a lovely old Victorian full of antiques. I was a little scared to touch anything when I came in all grubby. I almost wish it were cold enough for a fire so they'd light the charming wood stove in the sitting room. 
After showering, shopping in the little hiker resupply shop here, and eating a pulled pork sandwich, I got Boulder to drive me to Northern Outdoors. I got a giant chicken sandwich that sort of exploded while I ate it. I'm not even sure what all was on it, but definitely apple slices, avocado, and stone ground mustard. I got a beer sampler too, since they're a microbrewery. The IPA was the first one I've ever had that was even a little drinkable.  It tasted strongly of grapefruit, though, and I'm not a huge grapefruit fan. The other beers were all decent representations of their types. 
The building had a lot going on - swimming, hot tubs, pool, video games, loud music, and more. I found it overwhelming. I much prefer the quiet atmosphere back in Caratunk. 
The forecast for tomorrow is bad - thunderstorms, strong winds, hail, and up to half an inch of rain. I'll decide in the morning, but if there's room here I may take an unplanned zero.","East Carry Pond

I slept very well. At five my bladder pressed me to get up. I tried to go back to sleep but it was too late. My brain had already started making lists of things to get in Monson. Thanks a lot, brain. We could have slept at least another hour. I gave up and went to get coffee and sit in the kitchen with Paul, who was making breakfast. I found out that he was an antiques dealer, hence the house full of them. And he had cooked professionally. That was good news for us hikers, because it probably contributed to the spectacular breakfast he made. Thick sliced French toast, an enormous omelette with cheese and broccoli and mushrooms, perfectly cooked bacon, perfect home fried potatoes, big slices of bananas, and orange juice. We hikers ate family style in the dining room. It was just right for me. Enough to feel full, not so much that I was overstuffed. 
It took some investigation to find all my laundry. One sock, one bandanna, and my camp towel had migrated to a different load. I have no idea how this happened, as I know it all went in together last night, and I stuck my hand in the dryer and felt around when I got my load out this morning. I told Paul my theory about laundry machines being portals to alternate dimensions. 
I seriously considered staying at the hostel today due to the forecast, but decided to go at least as far as Pleasant Pond Lean-to and re-evaluate. 
I paid my bill, got a great big hug, and set out for the trail. At the trailhead were some dayhikers. I chatted with one, Malcom, briefly and it turns out that he's a member of the Tidewater ATC, of which my friend Just Blue Skies is the president. What a coincidence! There's a reasonably good chance that he and I were on the same work trip last year or thereabouts, when I drove down to Sherando and helped the TATC pull garlic mustard - an invasive species. 
At Pleasant Pond I ate a snack and hoped the sky would provide me with definitive information, but it didn't. The summit was only a mile away so I decided to start walking again. I figured the worst case scenario was that it would get stormy and I'd  backtrack to the shelter. However I was unaware that the trail continued over exposed ledge for miles on the north side of the mountain. It all worked out, though. It never did thunder or rain. At five I got water full of leafy bits from a stream, and started looking for a campsite. The first one was occupied, but they said there was another site past the next stream. Rock hopping across one end of Moxie Pond, I found the site shortly up the trail. It's a little closer to a road than I like, but it's a little travelled dirt road and I've heard more owls than cars. It should be fine. 
I set up the tent and let it air out for a while as it was still damp from East Carry Pond. I found a place to hang my bear line, then returned to the campsite. With my most important chores complete, it was time for dinner. I picked up tortillas in Caratunk, so I rolled up some sausage and cheese in them. This wasn't nearly as good as the same sausage and cheese on bagels. Ah well. It's food. 
I was almost done when it started sprinkling. I stowed my pack under the tent door, finished my wrap, and hung my food. When I got back I threw everything into the tent and climbed in. It's been raining off and on since then. I only hope there's a break in the rain when I need to pee before I sleep. In the mean time I'm enjoying being cozy in my tent and reflecting on what a nice day this turned out to be. It was cooler and cloudy so I could hike more comfortably. I didn't soak my clothes in sweat and today's heat rash is barely noticeable. Given that I hiked a full day and even set up camp before the rain came, it's a best case scenario.","Caratunk

It rained for much of the night. A small river formed under my tent as water ran down from the hill above. I checked the perimeter and the inside of the tent was fine. 
I heard a loud thunk. Afraid that the branch holding my food bag had fallen, I trekked up the trail to check, dodging the new puddles. I don't know what fell, but my food bag was fine. 
In the morning it was cloudy. The inside of my tent was damp from the night's exhalations. I wiped down the walls but knew the tent would need more drying later. 
Two miles up the trail, I came to a trail sign that just said ""privy"". Sure enough there was an outhouse down the trail. About a tenth of a mile away, across a stream, lay the next shelter. 
I got lost on Moxie Bald. The trail markings were difficult. I followed cairns to a summit sign but couldn't see where it went from there. I scouted multiple options before realizing that the trail stopped before the actual summit, then turned nearly back in the direction I had come. With no blazes or other direction, the unidirectional cairns were not incredibly helpful. Thoroughly annoyed, chilled, and wind blown, I finally continued north on the trail. 
At the next shelter north I stopped for lunch. Walking up to the shelter I thought I saw feet dangling from the bench. When I came around the corner there was no one. Just several fresh drops of water near where the feet had been. I ate lunch, and the drops evaporated as I sat there. Somebody must have left from the right side of the shelter as I walked in from the left. Was it something I said?
I made good time and thought to stay at Horseshoe Canyon Leanto tonight, but five miles out I caught a stick against the side of my shoe. It twisted my leg, forcing my knee into an unnatural position. I didn't hear a pop or feel a tear, but it hurt right away. It felt strained. The top of my calf hurt just behind my knee, and the iliotibial band or something near it hurt in the outside of my knee. It hurt very much to walk downhill. 
I revised my plan. A passing southbound hiker told me he had seen tentsites within the last mile or so. I stopped to get water at my first opportunity, then started looking for tenting. After about two miles I found a large established campsite. Grumpily I set up my tent, once again leaving it empty to dry out. I also evicted another of those damn orange slugs. This one had set up shopkeeping in the fold of the door and had spent all day rolled up in the tent in its stuffsack. 
I got to the site at 4:15. With lots of time to blow I cooked an actual dinner. I'm not sure what, if anything, to do for my leg. Rest should help. Tomorrow morning I'll have a better idea of how bad it really is. My planned rest day in Monson may stretch to two or more. I don't want to start the 100 mile wilderness on a sketchy knee that could leave me stranded or slow me down so much that I run out of food. 
I'd love to talk to somebody else about it but I haven't had cell service in days, and have not spoken with another human being for more than a few seconds. It seems unlikely that anyone else will camp here. Maybe I'll get lucky, though.","Moxie Pond

Two young men walked by without stopping at about 5. Other than that I saw no people. Or animals for that matter. 
I read for a while, having difficulty keeping my knee in a position in which it didn't hurt. A little after 7, I got sleepy, shrugged, and put things away so I could sleep. No reason to stay up late, and sleep is when your body heals. Or at least mine does. 
I fell asleep holding my knee, the only position I could find that didn't hurt. A little awkward, but doable. After that, my muscles started relaxing while I slept, relieving the tension on my knee. When I woke up to turn over, I had more position options. As long as I kept a slight bend in it, it was fine. 
At 1 I woke up and realized I was chilly. I dug out my puffy jacket to layer with my sleeping bag. Then I dug out my fleece top. ( I had been planning to send the fleece home since it's been so warm. Now I think I had better not. ) I pulled my hat down to cover the tip of my nose, which was so cold it was running. All this was enough to let me sleep. 
At 6:40 or so I woke up, with nearly 12 hours of sleep under my little hiker belt. I felt pretty good. My knee still wanted to be kept slightly bent though. I got my food out of the tree and decided it was a hot coffee in the sleeping bag sort of morning. 
I needed to filter water so I moved my sleeping bag out of the way, baring my (clothed) legs. Sometimes the filter leaks. Better safe than sorry. After I finished filtering, I realized that my feet were so cold they were going numb. Dang it was chilly! I dove back into the bag while I finished my coffee. 
I packed up and started walking. I didn't know how many miles I could do on that knee, so I couldn't count on getting to town today. And I wasn't even sure how far I was from town, since I had to guesstimate my location last night. Imagine my surprise when I walked a hundred feet and found myself at the river ford. I had been spot on!
I scouted the bank for the shallowest crossing, double bagged my phone, braced for icy water, and plunged in. To my surprise, the water felt great. It was actually a little warm compared to my feet. I never bother taking off shoes and socks these days. Crossing barefoot hurts, and my shoes are safer and less slippery than crossing in my crocs. My thin socks and mostly mesh shoes dry quickly. I find it a little humorous now when I find people laboriously removing footgear, tender footing across rocky stream beds, and carefully drying their feet before putting shoes on. Sometimes they do this multiple times a day. Meanwhile I've crossed in seconds and I'm on my squelchy way. 
I found that once I warmed up, my knee was pretty happy if I a) kept it slightly bent, and b) stepped on flat, stable surfaces. That was doable. I kept a pace of about 1.5 mph. Not stellar but way better than I expected. 
Shortly after Horseshoe Canyon I found Tom sitting by the side of the trail. He told me he'd been vomiting for three days and he was trying to get into town. I dug out some electrolytes to leave with him and wished him well. It's miserable to hike when you feel bad, and not being able to eat when you're exercising is the pits too. Later I heard that he had made it into town. 
At the trailhead I called Shaw's for a ride. They brought me back to the hostel but were out of beds. I got the sofa for the night, with a bed promised for tomorrow. The restaurants in town were closed, and the hostel offered a steak dinner, so I signed up for that. Mostly I wanted the salad and baked potato that came with it. The baked potato was the size of a softball. I put an obscene amount of sour cream on it. It was delicious. 
I was happy to see F Stop and Leif. Leif, being a little Jack Russell Terrier type dog, is super cute. And he was pretty happy to get my steak leftovers. F Stop says he's been eating a LOT of food. Like half a pack of hot dogs at once, in addition to his regular food. I don't know where he puts it. Must have a hollow leg. 
Tomorrow I'll resupply, mail some things home, and rest as much as I'm able in between running errands. I'm looking forward to seeing the Hundred Mile Wilderness again. Even more I'm looking forward to seeing my husband again.","West Branch of Piscataquis River

I slept about as well on the couch as one might expect. Early in the morning I got up and went to the main building, where I found that AJ had just made coffee. I had a LOT. Eventually there was breakfast. Current Shaw's practice is to ask how you want your eggs. You get three eggs cooked how you want, three strips of bacon, and half a plate of home fries. After that, as many blueberry pancakes as you can eat. 
After that I opened my maildrop a and started planning my food. I estimate seven nights in the woods, eight days of hiking to get to Abol Bridge. With what I shipped myself, I needed a few more snacks. I walked to town and bought things from each of the little stores. Candy, granola, and protein bars, combos, and Advil. I screwed up my mail drop and I'll run out of Celebrex before I get home. Advil won't keep me as pain free, but it's better than nothing. I will be grateful to see JD with more Celebrex. Among other things. 
I had an early lunch at Lakeshore House, then returned to Shaw's to organize my food and buy a bigger food bag. Eight days of food definitely don't fit in the bag I've been using. How in the heck am I going to haul this thing up into a tree?
I considered buying work gloves for climbing Katahdin, but my pack will be heavy enough already. I'll have to have scraped up hands instead. I also looked for a backup power bank, but there were none to be had. I'll have to economize on usage. Not that I make calls, of course. 
Between picking up Neon's box of treats (Thanks, Neon!), buying food, getting lunch, getting dinner, etc, I think I made five trips into town. It's literally just around the corner, but it was still a little annoying. Plus I screwed up my food/enzyme balance and ended up too sick to eat my dang dinner.  I definitely should have taken a capsule with the ice cream cone I ate after the lemon berry cake I had for lunch dessert. Instead, I got a reminder of why I carry the capsules. 
With eight days of food, my food bag alone must weigh at least 16 pounds, and probably more. I'm trying to decide if I'll take Chase's advice and get some of it dropped into the wilderness for me. If I can carry it without hurting myself, I'd rather do that. I carried ten days worth in 2011 and I didn't die. Much.","Monson

I ate breakfast. Not in thruhiker quantities, but I gave it the old college try. As I was going to toss the remains, AJ told me to ask around to see if anybody wanted the bacon off my plate. ""Seriously?"" He nodded yes, so I did. I got an enthusiastic taker. 
The hike was fairly uneventful. As usual it wasn't quite like I remembered it. I had completely forgotten the Big Wilson Stream ford. On the far side I found a man wearing a full sized towel while his clothes dried. He had been floating in the river for funsies. He was trying to get to town tonight - and it was 4:30 and he was 10 miles out from town. And his knee hurt. It didn't seem that likely to me. 
It was a struggle to get that dang food bag up in the tree FYI. 
Oh and my knee feels pretty decent, even with the heavy pack. This morning the pack felt good but it got heavier as the day went on. Stupid backpack physics. And I didn't eat all of today's food because of my wonky stomach. I sure wish I had though. Also I realized that Neon sent me a POUND of sour patch kids. I'm eating them as fast as I can. 
At the shelter were two brothers I had met at Shaw's, Cannonball and Gozer. They're good company. I led a little yoga, which I totally need to note in my online tally.","Monson

Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575535,"8/10Extremely stealthy site near stream prior to Chairback Gap13.9 miles
Woof, that was a long day. 7 AM to 8 PM. I awoke as the sky started to lighten. I ate breakfast and packed as quietly as I could. I visited the privy just before leaving. When I returned to the shelter, the guys were awake and I said goodbye. 
The morning passed quickly. I relished walking on dirt. After hundreds of miles walking primarily on different types of rock, the return of dirt has been most welcome - even if it brings occasional mud with it. The dirt feels soft against my weary feet. 
The climb up to Barren Ledges went a little faster than I thought it might. When I got to the sign for Cloud Pond Lean-to, it was 2:30. I decided to move on. I had carried about three liters of water up from valley, and I still had almost two liters. This was important because I knew water was scarce during today's hike. The six pounds of water were heavy to carry up that mountain in an already heavy pack, but they gave me some freedom. Otherwise I would have been forced to go down to Cloud Pond for water, a half mile downhill from the trail. 
I knew that by passing up on Cloud Pond, I was committing to hiking all the way to the stream before Chairback Gap. I thought I might get here around seven if my pace held, but it did not. I developed a pain in one shin coming up Barren Mountain. And the footing was tedious on Fourth, Three and a Half, and Third mountains. So I moved along at slightly over a mile an hour. 
When I finally arrived at the stream it was nearly dark. I gathered water and started looking for a place to camp. I found one well into the woods. It probably isn't the site described to me. I think I guessed the wrong direction to walk on the path near the stream. At any rate, I found a flat spot, erected the tent on it, and climbed in as the world went dark. 
Before I entered the tent, I inspected the woods, looking for branches to hang my food bag. I'm in an area of tall straight trees with no branches in my throwing range. Dandy. I guess I'm not hanging my food tonight. I sincerely hope not to attract a bear's attention. I'm debating sleeping with earplugs. I mean, how much good will it really do me to hear a bear coming? It will or it won't, and I have zero tools to defend myself if it does. Well, I have a sharp, tiny trowel. I don't see that doing much to a bear. 
I'm tired enough that sleep probably won't be an issue anyway. I have given myself instructions to sleep in, too. However I'm terrible at following orders so I will probably get up at dawn as usual. 
I was too tired to fool with dinner when I got here. I ate the rest of a protein bar left over from yesterday's snacks and called it good. Today's snacks were finished before I got here. Eating all the snacks is good in that I will have less to carry. Except for tonight's planned dinner, dangit. I was looking forward to it, too. Polenta with Italian sausage. It's one of my favorites. And I was going to add sriracha or red pepper flakes. I hope I have time and energy to cook tomorrow. If I have to carry multiple unused dinners out of this wilderness, I'm going to be pretty mad.","Wilson Valley Lean-to

I slept fitfully and earplug-free. At dawn the birds started singing loudly and I grumpily grabbed my earplugs and stuffed them in. And then I slept blissfully for another hour. Okay, noted. Don't try sleeping without them. 
I eventually sort of woke up. Despite my bear worry, I must admit that it was nice not to have to retrieve my food from a tree. I decided to treat myself to the one poptart I was carrying. For some reason this maildrop (packed by me in some kind of fugue state) mostly had smoothies for breakfast. But I felt like I'd had a rough day yesterday and this was a good time for the hallowed poptart. It was delicious. 
I packed up and was looking for a place to dig my morning cat hole when three men hiked by. I had not been as isolated as I thought. I was super, super glad that I hadn't dropped trou yet. I dropped my tp and trowel on the ground and struck a casual pose while they passed. Then I found what I hoped was a more concealed location. 
Going up Columbus Mountain, I found a long relocation that completely skipped a spring the trail used to go by. Okay fine, I'll get water later. I stopped by the Chairback Privy and it started raining while I was inside. I decided to wait it out at the shelter. While I was there I was surprised to see Malink come in southbound. It was nice to catch up with him. 
It didn't stop raining but it let up some. I sighed and headed out, not thrilled about doing Chairback with wet rocks and roots. It was fine though. I was even slower than usual, making sure that everywhere I stepped was safe so I wouldn't slide. It took forever but I got through it without incident. 
On the way down I observed another dry spring. Hmm. 
I came upon a stream, finally, and stopped to filter water. Hot Pants and Home Ec showed up! I was happy to see them. They said they were going to the same shelter as me tonight but I didn't see them. They probably tented. 
The trek up from the Pleasant River started great but as I tired the trail stretched out. I had no way to tell exactly where I was. All I knew was the shelter was on the other side of water. So when it seemed like I should be there and I got to water, I picked up three liters. 
It wasn't the right stream. 
That water was so heavy that I could barely pick my pack up to put it on. I considered dumping it, but that also would take effort. I walked on. 
When I finally got to the shelter, I rewarded myself by finally making and eating the dinner I never made last night. I added some sharp cheddar and red pepper flakes. It was delicious!
As I ate I observed mice running around. Apparently they aren't too afraid of people. I hope they leave me a little food. My bag is hung from a nail in a rafter. There wouldn't be much to stop a mouse from chewing through it. I still need several days worth of food. I looked for hanging options in the woods but again didn't find much. We shall see what the mice have left me in the morning.","Chairback Gap

I'm so glad my journey doesn't end at Katahdin. I'm nowhere near ready for this to be over. A little time at home will be good, yes. But I'm not ready to let go of this experience. 
This morning dawned damp and gloomy. I took the time to make hot coffee and held off putting on yesterday's wet clothing until the last minute. I set out into the drizzle a little before 8. 
I need to send the Maine Appalachian Trail Conference a note. Between my hike in 2011 and now, a whole lot of trail work has been done. Some of the stone steps on Gulf Hagas Mountain look like they were finished yesterday. It's good solid work and should be serviceable for decades. Kudos to them! It's skilled, heavy work. They must have some very dedicated members. 
Also on Gulf Hagas was more moose poop than I've ever seen in one place. It was in drifts along the trail. It was like a giant hamster cage that badly needed cleaning. Truly a remarkable amount of excrement. And still no actual moose in sight. 
Whitecap Mountain was fogged in when I summited, just like last time. I suppose I'll never see the view from there for myself. It was drizzling, cold, and windy at the top. I beat feet out of there rather than taking advantage of probably my one chance to contact JD before I leave the wilderness. It wasn't worth risking water damage to the electronics. Nor was it worth hypothermia. Not that I put much thought into it until I was out of the danger zone. 
I'm in my tent because the mosquitoes were out when I got here. They're gone now but I'm already settled. No point in moving now. I hope it doesn't rain again, though. 
My feet are in rough shape. New shoes combined with wet feet from rain and frequent fords means pretty bad rubs. I did some trail laundry tonight and washed my socks to see if it will help. I don't have great hope, but it can't hurt at any rate. My trail laundry consisted of water I boiled mixed with straight river water so I could do a warm water wash. I put a few drops of concentrated soap in a ziplock along with the warm water and a sock, and shook it vigorously. Four rinses later the water in the bag stayed considerably clearer after I shook it so I called it good. I wrung them out and the socks are hanging in my tent, where I don't really expect them to dry. Perhaps if the sun comes out tomorrow?
The long days of hiking in the damp have done a number on other areas of skin, too. So far it's not bad enough to make me quit early in the day, although I could foresee that happening. 
I was looking at the calendar today and I think I did the math wrong at some point. I think I'll get to Baxter State Park a day earlier than I planned. I really like my idea of going down to Roaring Brook after I summit Katahdin, but it isn't a reasonable plan unless JD is there to pick me up. I'll have to figure out what to do about it when I get closer to Abol Bridge. I could always spend a day at Abol Bridge or find a way in to Millinocket for a night, I suppose. I guess that's a problem for later. For now, there are still miles to walk.","Carl Newhall Lean-to

I keep seeing these soft around the edges, shell shocked southbounders. It makes me remember what starting a long hike is like. What it's like to start at Katahdin, which is a beast of a climb, and then plunge right into the hundred mile wilderness carrying ten days of food with an unconditioned body. And knowing, if they've been paying attention, that very difficult terrain awaits them not much further south. I wonder what the dropout rate is for southbounders? How many get to Monson and decide they'd rather do something a little less strenuous with their year?
It also magnified for me how lean and confident the northbounders look by now. They've been through a lot. Most have shed a fair amount of weight, burning themselves down to mile covering machines. They all look hungry. And most of them really are. 
I'm not that hungry - I pack a lot of food so I don't run a big calorie deficit. I'm not lean either, although I'm starting to see hollows in places where I haven't in a long time. I think I was already confident in my abilities from previous thousands of miles. I wonder if others would see changes in me? I think that this trip has so far done a good job of refilling my well of patience. But that's mostly invisible. 
I've had a long day today. Not so much in hours as in miles. It was mostly flat terrain, so I could move quickly. Quick walking on flat ground used different muscles than have been called on recently. As a result my shins ache abominably. 
At the halfway point I thought about stopping early. I really had no pressing reason to come this far today, other than that I had scheduled it. I could stretch my food another day. But it's a pretty campsite here, and I couldn't tolerate the bro atmosphere at the last shelter. So I kept going. All things considered, I'm just as happy to be here. I don't have any other days this long planned before I reach Katahdin.","East Branch Lean-to

Some days I walk in wonder, and some days I just walk. Today was one of the latter. 
I slept badly at Antlers. It may be picturesque, but it didn't give me a good night's sleep. I tossed and turned. Finally I turned on my headlamp and took some Benadryl. I was itchy all over and I couldn't get comfortable in any position. The bonus was that I was awake to see the moon shining down gloriously on the lake, a truly moving sight. And the dawn was fabulous. But I spent today feeling like I'd been ridden hard and put away wet. My legs felt like lead on the flats, and burned on the hills. 
I probably should have gone to White House Landing for hot food, a shower, and a bed. But the register at Potaywadjo said they were turning away people without reservations. And I wasn't in the mood to deal with people or tiptoeing around the uncertain tempers of the owners of the place. 
I did get water from the beautiful spring at Potaywadjo, which has the best water I think I've ever had. I dumped out what I already had to fill up on icy cold fresh spring water. The spring itself is a circle about ten feet across with utterly clear water and clean sand under it. There is a board laid so you can walk out to the middle of the pool to dip water. It was one of three springs where I got water today - the other two being Wood Rat and the unnamed spring on the beach at Nahmakanta lake. 
It really wasn't a long day of hiking. I'm just feeling it more than usual. When I got to the shelter tonight, I made dinner (extra crunchy because somebody was sweeping the shelter in my direction, unfortunately) and then retired to my tent. I fully intend to be asleep before dark tonight.","Antlers Campsite

Yay, a walk in wonder day!
I fell deeply asleep in the evening, tired and comfortable in my unlovely tentsite behind the shelter. At one thirty I had to get up to dig a cat hole. After that, with most of a good night's sleep under my belt, I slept more intermittently. And my sleeping pad somehow shifted to a weird position in which it was possible to fall out of bed - which I did, several times. I fell only inches, meaning it was startling and confusing, but not harmful. I wasn't awake enough to figure out why it was happening. 
At six I got up. I had warned my neighbors that I was likely to start rustling around once the sky lightened. I saw no sign of them, nor heard any movement, in the hour I spent on breakfast, packing, and brushing my teeth. 
By seven or so I was walking. I immediately started walking up an intensely pretty mountain. I was surprised to find myself at the summit of Nesuntabunt a while later. My guide showed two smaller peaks first. This explained some surprise climbs yesterday afternoon. The guide has the shelter marked in the wrong place. I'm not sure if this means the mileage listed is wrong or not. 
After that I followed the picturesque Rainbow Stream up a gorge with waterfall after waterfall. I'm not really a waterfall girl - I prefer mountaintops. But even I was delighted. 
I was surprised to find myself in camp at three thirty. Severe storms were predicted, so I set up my tent and put my pack under cover, then went to find the spring. It pumps gallons per minute of clear, cold water right into Rainbow Lake. I put my water bag under the conveniently placed pipe and filled it quickly. 
My last chore was hanging a bear line. Shouldn't I be good at this by now? I didn't count but I estimate it took thirty tries to get the line where I wanted it. It went low, it went backwards, it bounced off the branch. Once it landed in a divot on the branch itself. I'm lucky it didn't get stuck that time. Once it actually went over, but too close too another tree so my bag could still have been grabbed easily. So frustrating. 
So far there is no sign of severe storms or the hail that was also predicted. But maybe it will be a wet night. 
Other people have started arriving at the campsite. This is good. Maybe the mosquitoes swarming around my tent will go harass them, instead.","Wadleigh Stream Lean-to

Sometimes rain on the tent is soothing. Sometimes it pours, and the condensation splashes down from the ceiling. Guess which last night was? Also guess whose tent floor is not so much waterproof anymore? Luckily it only leaked under my sleeping pad, which for now is still waterproof. The tent floor clips in and is easily replaceable. I wish I could remember how old the floor is. It might be from my old tent. When I get the chance I need to hold it up to bright light and look for holes. But it might just be time for a new one. 
The morning's walk was beautiful and fairly easy. As usual mosquitoes were buzzing my head net and biting my hands. It drives me nuts when people tell me the mosquitoes aren't that bad. Sure, if you aren't the one they like to bite. I'm sure not wearing that head net for fashion reasons!
I took a spill in the last five miles. I stepped on a slippery rock, my feet flew up, and I landed on my pack. That was good as far as it went, but it was still jarring and I managed to ding up a wrist a little bit. Just a strain I think. My neck isn't too thrilled either but I think it will be okay. 
At Abol Bridge I rented a bunk for two nights, then went into the new restaurant. The overwhelmed waitress took a long time to get my order, but it was quite good when I got it - a Katahdin Red beer and some fried chicken. 
I bought shampoo and soap and detergent. First on the agenda was showering. I had to dry off with my filthy camp towel but I think I got approximately clean. I got dressed in my rain skirt and jacket so I could wash all my clothes. Next stop was the laundry, where I lucked into an empty washing machine. Given that there's only one, this is amazing. 
I bought an ice cream cone and walked back to the restaurant to use the wifi and charge things a little. The wifi is expensive - $2/hour, $25/day, $45/month. It also barely works. I could get out text messages, but that was about it. No updating the journal. 
I met the trail steward and he suggests summitting on Friday. Saturday is supposed to be rainy. I'm not too excited about this idea, both because JD is meeting me on Saturday, and because I'd like a day of rest. I'll try to get a revised forecast tomorrow and decide then. I bought some food this evening that will get me to the thruhiker site in the park tomorrow and over the mountain the day after, if needed. I'm sure the AT Lodge can squeeze in one unannounced hiker if need be. 
The bunk I'm sleeping on is a nice change from my air mattress. Now if I could just kill the mosquito that's in here with me..","Rainbow Lake Campsite

An evil headache gripped the base of my skull as the effects of my fall came home to roost. No position I could find seemed to help. I felt feverish, stripping off layers of clothing to try to get comfortable. My stomach roiled with nausea. Despite the comfort of the bed, it was not a good night. 
But at least I killed that damned mosquito. 
I woke up at six and contemplated my day. I dug migraine medication out of my bag. If my head still felt bad after I'd been up a while, I would take it. I hoped that loosening my muscles up, as well as caffeine, would work instead. 
I twiddled my thumbs until the breakfast buffet was due to open. Then I twiddled some more, as it opened late. It was a disappointing breakfast with lukewarm reheated pancakes and disks of egg. The coffee cups were tiny foam cups. The juice cups were Dixie cups. 
I paid for more wifi. The forecast had gotten worse. Despite my desire, maybe even my need, to stay and recuperate, I decided that I had better pack up and go. I'd rather feel crappy going up Katahdin than go up in bad weather. 
When I got to the kiosk, only one person had registered for the Birches ahead of me. I was pretty surprised. The way people had been talking, I thought it would be full. Especially given the weather situation. 
The walk through the park passed quickly. I listened to music for a while until I looked at my phone and saw that it was for some reason draining the battery. I shut it down to deal with later. 
I stepped off the trail to have a private moment and narrowly missed being beaned by a pine cone. An angry chipmunk cussed at me the whole time I was there, even bluff charging me and shaking his tiny fists. But when I made a sudden movement, he backed off. He was crazy enough to threaten a predator a hundred times his size, but not stupid enough to follow through. 
At Katahdin Stream Campground I found the ranger away, so I went up to the shelter and made a hot lunch. I walked back to register and get water from the stream. The ranger gave me some advice about the hike. I told her about my original plan to descend at Roaring Brook, but that I'd have to hitchhike to do it now. She suggested the Abol Trail.  She said it had been largely relocated since I last hiked it. The top is still bad for half a mile, but after that it's on switchbacks. I may go down Abol Slide after all. Then it's only 2-3 miles back to KSC to pick up the gear I'll drop there in the morning. 
A thruhiker and a section hiker showed up. I talked about how my leg muscles aren't recovering like they used to, and burn on even small hills. Turns out I'm not the only one! This is comforting. Doesn't help the burn at all, but it's nice for my misery to have company. 
I saw more bear poop on the trail today than I have in my life. Almost completely composed of blueberries of course, but it gives one pause. There are bear cables at the shelter. Given that we are once again in a forest of tall trees with no lower branches, this is very helpful. I'll be hanging my toothpaste and even my towel. I used the towel to wipe out my pot after ginger chili noodle soup and I don't want to give a bear a hankering for Thai food. Unfortunately one of those brilliant orange sandwich crackers escaped from its package and lost structural integrity in my pack today. There are brilliant orange bits *everywhere*. In my fanny pack. ON my fanny pack. Inside my backpack. Somehow inside the lid of my arnica cream. I've tried to corral the bits but they're in the mud outside the shelter, adhering to the webbing parts of my gear, and generally creating what I imagine to be a glowing neon bear sign. I imagine that I'll sleep pretty well with that going on.","

At 4:53 I rolled over, notes that I was starting to be able to see shapes, and checked the time. I snuggled back into my bag. I had had one of those magical nights in which my pad felt comfy and the temperature was just right. I had been very happy to be asleep. But then I considered how I wanted to be hiking by six, and how long it actually takes me to get going. I sighed and sat up. 
First thing I dug out my down jacket and put it on. Then off came the wool socks. Still inside the sleeping bag, I stripped off my long underwear bottoms, then slipped on my pants and socks. I shimmied my bra around my waist, then very quickly removed my down jacket and long underwear top before sliding my arms into my bra, donning my shirt, and putting my down jacket back on. 
Forsaking the warmth of my sleeping bag, I went out to pee and grab my food bag from the bear cable. This morning being an important one, I put all my remaining coffee in my mug and heated up water to have hot coffee. Once that was ready, I had double breakfast - a honeybun AND poptarts. 
I finished separating out everything I didn't need to carry out and put it in my trash compactor bag. I cinched down all the straps on my pack, picked up my bag, and set out for the ranger station. I dropped my bag on the porch and left for the trail, where I was immediately stymied by a large group traveling together. They stood all together by the hiker register as one person signed them all in. Finally, it was my turn. I signed in at 6:20. 
With all the dayhikers, I finally had someone to be faster than. I played leapfrog with several, the tortoise to their hares. But finally my stamina won out over longer legs and athleticism. I will take my tiny triumphs where I can get them. 
I checked my findings with another hiker who had been there before, and the trail definitely no longer goes over a few former obstacles. So much the better, I say! It's still a tough hike, but there is no longer anywhere impassable by short people, or requiring true technical climbing skills. There are rocks piled under the crevice with rebar so you can step up high enough. The crevice I had to jam my knee into to climb it in 2011 is no longer there, or modified enough that I didn't recognize it. 
Four girls hiked ahead of my all the way up the mountain. They all wore brightly colored jackets in different colors. They looked like an REI ad. It was just so dang picturesque. One of them was the one to take my picture at the summit, and I returned the favor. My picture came out looking very 1930s, 1940s Girl Scout leader. 
The summit was windy, wet, and cold. It had started raining right before I reached the Tableland. I wasted no time descending as I was losing the feeling in my hands. I knew that I would be warm once I lost a few hundred feet of elevation. 
The ranger had said the Abol trail was much improved, so I gave it a go. It was so much better that I am unable to come up with a good enough superlative. There was an actual marked trail, for one thing, and it was stable enough that the ground slid almost not at all. A short distance down the slide, the trail now veers west across the mountain, then switchbacks prettily through moss covered boulders and forest. 
I met hiker Wei right before the trail veered, and we walked together the rest of the way to Abol Campground. He was worried about his friend who had not met him at the top of the Cathedral trail. He made good company for me, though. He's a little trail mad too, and wants to thruhike. We both thought the trail went on interminably in the rain. I was desperate for a privy by the time we finally reached the campground. Once I took care of necessities, I found the ranger station and signed out. Wei told me that if I couldn't find a ride out, I could stay at his lean-to and ride out with him in the morning. 
I set out to walk back to Katahdin Stream Campground. I couldn't remember how far away it was. Two miles? Three? I wanted to hitch but only two cars passed in my direction, and they didn't stop. I was stunned to find myself there in half an hour. I'm still not sure how far apart the two campgrounds are. 
I retrieved my gear from the ranger station and walked out to the Tote Road to try my luck hitching. The second car stopped. A hiker I had met several times was being driven out by family, and they stopped for me. I was ecstatic. They dropped me off right at the AT Lodge in Millinocket. 
The owners weren't there, but when I called they said to grab a bunk. I did, and immediately adjourned to the Schootic In for dinner. I had an utterly fabulous Buffalo chicken sandwich. Seriously, it was a good example of the genre. A couple of Blue Moons went down well too. I stopped at the soft ice cream truck the parks across from the lodge for a black raspberry cone, and all was right in my world. 
Ole Man and Navi weren't in yet, so I found sheets and made my bed, then took an amazing shower. So much hot water. So much water pressure. So much bliss. 
By the time I was clean, Navigator was about and I could pay for my bed. Tomorrow morning I envision an amazing breakfast at the AT cafe, and then at some point I will meet up with my beloved. It's a good life.","The Birches

I have seldom been so happy to get below treeline. 
I woke up a little before six and checked the clock. With JD wrapped around me in a safe warm bed, it was hard to get up. But I knew it would be a long, hard day. I got up to check the weather. The forecast hadn't changed much. Clouds clearing around noon, and wind gusts up to 25 mph. Good enough. 
I ate my poptarts and took my pills and I was ready to go. JD drove me to the Liberty Spring trailhead and kissed me. Then I was back on the trail. 
It was about a mile to the AT, mileage which didn't count in my total. Once I reached the AT, it climbed steeply for miles. My stomach started feeling sketchy. I got water at Liberty Spring, while my stomach cramped and I had cold chills. I visited the privy, my last chance for miles. I figured I was just freaking out because the last time I was here, I came down with an illness that was both awful and affected my life for years after. 
I continued uphill. As soon as I reached treeline, my intestines became a secondary consideration. The forecast was wrong. It was socked in and violently windy. It was worse than any wind I've ever experienced while hiking, including on Mt Washington and Cat Bell. On Mt Washington I had 70 mph wind gusts and had to brace myself. Today my poles flew horizontal if I didn't jam them into the ground, and several times I had to stop and crouch down or be blown away. Once I stepped on a loose rock and the wind took me the rest of the way down as my toes painfully went out of joint. 
I was in survival mode. I wasn't concerned with cold, hunger, or thirst. Just staying upright until I could get to safety. The wind continued at that level all the way to the end of the ridge, until I finally reached the protection of the trees. 
I never would have come up here today if I had known. 
The caretaker at this shelter says the forecast was for 60mph gusts. I'm pretty sure it went higher than that. 
Once I got to the woods, life went back to normal. My guts, thank goodness, were quiet. The trail was pretty normal for the Whites - steep and tricky. However southern Maine changed my perspective. Today felt relatively easy except for the wind. I wasn't particularly tired when I got to the shelter. If I'd had signal I might have texted JD to change plans and meet me tonight, but I didn't. So I will stay in the shelter as planned and hike the rest of the way tomorrow. 
At the shelter I met several nice hikers. There is actually a crowd and I didn't get all the names. Joy Hiker and SOL, Family Man, Genaro (and his sons). I'm kind of glad I'm spending the night here and meeting these folks. Not that I'm likely to ever see them again. 
Oh, and that forecast? Said the low tonight for the shelter would be 58. The caretaker's forecast says 40s. I believe his forecast. I think my setup will be fine, though. I'm glad I still have my silk liner and down jacket. I think I'll be using toilet paper to stuff my pillow again, with all my clothes called into use as insulation.   
Tomorrow: two more miles of AT, then I'm heading out the Gale River Trail to meet my sweetie again and go the heck home for a couple of weeks. I need to go soak up some dog love from Beauty and Dulce, and I need to cuddle my cat Andy. Also I have a long list of tasks to take care of - resupply, permethrin treatments, that sort of thing. But mostly it's about soaking up the love.","Liberty Spring Trailhead

I woke up at a few minutes to six. Most of us had been in our sleeping bags at eight. Some waited until eight thirty. Either way, we'd all been sleeping a long time. I didn't want to be the first to make noise, but somebody had to. I started changing into my hiking clothes while still in my sleeping bag. Other rustling started. I stuffed my sleeping bag in its sack, then released the valve on my mattress. The valve was apparently the signal. Suddenly everybody was up. I heard somebody say they didn't want to be the one to make noise first. Hah!
With all the people there it took a while to get a turn in the privy. I didn't leave until 7:40. I had forgotten just how long the two miles to the Gale River Trail intersection would take. They were tedious walking, with lots of dicey rocks to descend and lots more wet tilted slab to negotiate. 
I finally got to the intersection around ten. The first half mile or so was bouldery. Finally I got to a place where I could walk almost normally. I had no idea exactly where I was on the trail, which made it hard to estimate how fast I was going. At 11:45 I ate my last snack. Agh! And maybe an hour to go before I reached the car! But then right after noon I saw cars in the distance. I was saved! And also on time. 
JD gave me a giant bottle of coke and a roasted garlic ciabatta to gnaw on, and we were off! I'm so excited to be going home for a little while. I miss everything and everyone. And I'm also excited to be heading out into Virginia afterward. The idea of being able to walk fast rather than pick my way through rocks is just so appealing.","Garfield Ridge Shelter

JD had a coughing fit at 6:30. The dogs and I awoke. I glanced at the clock and realized it was relatively late going by hiker time. I turned on a light to get up by. 
JD had picked up ""con crud"" at Dragoncon. Con crud is the generic term for the sorts of upper respiratory viruses that go around these big groups of people crowded into relatively small places. It's a glorious breeding ground for those of the viral persuasion. It's no surprise that he picked it up, but it's always a bummer. I'm just assuming I'll get it too. JD speculated that he had it before he actually got to the con - in which case I was definitely exposed. I should find out soon. 
I ate my breakfast and checked the weather - local, AT, and Hurricane Irma. There's no telling where Irma will head but I need to stay aware. Locally and on the AT, a rainy day was predicted. Oh joy! An all day rain for my first day back. At least I got to start the day dry. 
I specifically did not kiss JD goodbye, although I'm dubious at how effective not kissing is when you've been sharing a bed and a car. He went home to spend the rest of the day being sick. I walked off into the rain. 
These home-trail transitions are so weird. Even as I drive to the trail, it's hard to really believe that I won't be sleeping in my own bed tonight. Two weeks ago, while I was on the trail up north, it was hard to believe I'd be sleeping in my own bed very soon. And going home where everything is familiar feels odd too, like after months away I should stumble over daily routines. But as soon as I enter the house I fall back into my suburban normal. Then I wonder if I had really just been hiking up crazy mountains or if it were just a daydream. 
The day went by soggily. My IT bands started hurting early on. They never got horrible, but the pain was noticeable all day. Mostly I was alone in the mist. Which was fortunate because I had to pee all day. I don't know if it was from having wet stuff up against me, or my hipbelt tight over my bladder, or what. But I dove off the side of the trail to peel my sodden pants off of me on multiple occasions. 
I finally came up to the side trail for Blackburn a little after four. Despite my IT bands I made good time in the afternoon, after the rocks around Harpers Ferry let up. I gingerly climbed down the side trail. I have stopped here for water many times, but I have never spent the night. I was very pleasantly surprised when I entered the hiker cabin. There are four double size bunks and a functional wood stove! Another hiker made a fire which I am greatly enjoying. It was in the 60s today but I had been soaked since morning and I was chilled. 
I have my clothes and rain gear hung up to dry. I look forward to a cozy night and dry clothes in the morning. It should be nice the next few days. Yippee! I love hiking on those sorts of days!","Front Royal

I didn't realize just how much I needed that fire until hours later when I realized that despite food and heat, my feet were STILL cold. I warmed up the rest of the way within the next hour. Without the fire, I would have had a very uncomfortable night. Instead, I slept great and woke up to dry clothes. No morning yells of horror were necessary as it was quite comfortable to put on my clothes. Except for my socks, which had dried stiff. 
As the world grew more defined, I packed as quietly as I could. The inevitable crinkly sounds made me cringe slightly, but I packed as quickly as I could so the other fellow could return to the slumber that I presume I had disturbed. I walked over to the cabin and set my backpack down on a table around the corner from the three sleepers. Cheryl, the caretaker, had left coffee ready to brew. I hit the button and waited impatiently. 
After I ate and packed up, I checked the time. 7:30?! I had gotten up at 6. How long does it take to drink a cup of coffee? Okay, two cups of coffee. Okay, two and a half, but that's my final offer. 
It wasn't truly raining, but it was very misty and the leaves were wet, so I started with rain gear and pack cover on. Within an hour beams of light started appearing in the mist. They looked spectacular, and were warm when I walked through them. Soon after that I glimpsed a patch of blue, and it turned into a beautiful day. 
Around lunchtime I arrived at Snickers Gap and walked immediately to the Horseshoe Curve restaurant, where I had the stereotypical cheeseburger, fries, and a coke. They weren't the best I'd ever had, but they hit the spot. 
Shortly after I started walking again I felt a sudden sharp pain in my hand. I'd been hit by an acorn. It left a mark. These are largish acorns and I estimate that they could be falling from as high as 80 to 100 feet up. I think that if it had hit one of the bones in the back of my hand, it could have broken the bone. I'm trying not to imagine how much it would hurt to get hit in the head by one of these little menaces. 
When I reached the shelter I decided to sleep in it. I had been planning to tent, but I'm not sure my tent would survive impact with a kamikaze acorn.  I hear them falling in the woods, often making quite a ruckus. I expect it will be pretty dang loud if one hits the shelter roof. 
When I took off my socks I was surprised to see a sizable blister near the base of a toe. It hadn't hurt while I walked. I almost wonder if I somehow encountered poison ivy. It doesn't really itch, either. I'm leaving it alone for tonight. I have no idea how to bandage it tomorrow. It's in an inconvenient spot. I'm thinking my stiff socks may be to blame. This is problematic. I don't carry an electric dryer with me, and I can't carry enough socks to have a clean pair every day. Stupid sensitive skin.","Blackburn Trail Center

A fellow showed up right at full dark last night. It was good to have company. He set up a hammock so I had the best of both worlds - company plus the freedom to crinkle. I slept great. 
He didn't, though. He was pretty new to backpacking and his setup was wildly inadequate for the temperatures. He said it was the worst sleep of his life. He hadn't used his stove before either, but the stove wasn't a problem. He chalked the night up to a learning experience and called for a ride rather than spend another night like that. I thought that was smart. 
It was another beautiful day but I was a bit anxious and it detracted from my hike. I needed to hike a longer day than I have recently, and the first half of it was in the Roller Coaster. It went fine, despite my concerns. I arrived at the new Whiskey Hollow shelter well before dark. My feet hurt, but not horrendously. My current discomfort is a headache from a fire some sectioners built in the fire pit in front of the shelter. It's blowing smoke right into the shelter. The area isn't blessed with flat spots so I'm in the shelter breathing the smoke. I expect they'll stay up late chewing the fat around the fire. I might too in the same situation. But it promises to be a miserable night for me. 
I met Wash and Biscuit somewhere in the middle of the day. They are doing much higher mileage days than me so I'll never see them again, but I used the opportunity to ask questions about the Colorado Trail since Wash had hiked there a lot. 
Tomorrow JD is bringing me some things, and soon after that I hope to stay at a hostel and get cleaned up. Non-stiff socks are on my agenda.","Sam Moore shelter

The smoke shifted direction slightly. Less of it filled the shelter. This didn't diminish my headache. But worse was the leg pain. Not smoke related, of course. As I relaxed on my sleeping pad, new parts of my legs would speak up with painful clarity. I massaged spasms around my hips, knees, quads, and calves. I'm not sure if it was yesterday's slightly higher mileage or my body getting used to the trail again, but it sucked. 
The fast young sobos who stayed at the shelter last night were planning for a 24 mile day plus a town stop for groceries. They got up well before dawn. It was nice not to be first. I rolled over to snooze a little more but also got up before dawn. I shoved everything in my pack and walked to the old Dick's Dome shelter to make breakfast away from the smoke. My headache called for intervention so I took Advil. I don't like to do that before hiking but you gotta do what you gotta do. 
I've been thinking about a snippet of conversation I had with that neophyte hiker. He asked me what I carried for protection. I said I carried nothing. He was carrying a handgun and bear spray. I asked him if he carried at home, and he said yes. He always carried. Everyone at home did. 
He said he would rather do anything than kill someone. That seems not quite true, else why carry a killing tool? I think it's problematic because carrying it changes your point of view. It's always there. Every interaction carries the possibility of gunfire. In light of that, paranoia would seem to me to be hard to avoid. At some level you must view everyone you meet as a possible enemy. I don't see how that could not taint your view of the world. 
I know some former military folks who always carry. They fought in war zones and now they never truly feel safe. It's a reasonable response to that trauma, but I don't think it's a reasonable way to live if you haven't lived through that. I think those folks are permanently injured. They should be cherished for their sacrifice and we should care for them with their past in mind. But I don't want their mindset to spread to the general population. Living in fear and suspicion puts distance between people. We already have too much distance. We already see those around us as Other. We need to see those around us as Us. 
In lighter news, the weather today was spectacular. It's the kind of weather that makes you glad to be alive. It was a wonderful temperature for hiking. I cruised along at about two miles an hour, feeling great once the Advil kicked in. I texted JD to let him know I was ahead of schedule. He met me five minutes after I got to our planned meeting point. He whisked me away to Spelunkers in Front Royal for lunch. The food tasted great but the company was what really appealed. 
He dropped me back off at the trail with the bag of supplies I had packed before I left. Partway up the first hill, my body let me know that maybe a big greasy lunch hadn't been my best idea ever. I battened down the hatches and instituted code brown protocols. I held it together until I reached the shelter and it's beautiful, beautiful privy. 
It really is a nice privy, actually. That's not just me talking out of my butt. 
It was only three but I called it a day. This shelter is one of the nicest on the trail. There's a lovely deck on the front with an Adirondak bench. And a solar shower, a piped spring, horseshoe pits, mowed grass.. I've stayed at worse motels. Granted, most motels have four walls.","

It got quite chilly overnight. Even with my down jacket draped over me, I was uncomfortable. I had enough awareness to think that I would need to start sleeping with my filter soon, but not enough to get out my silk liner which might have made me warm. Fortunately it should be warmer at night for at least the next week, according to the forecast. 
Clover and Yogi were up before me. I slept in because I knew I wasn't going far. I really enjoyed meeting those two. But like everyone else they're going faster than me so I'm unlikely to see them again. Nevertheless I hope our paths cross. 
The weather was perfect. The trail was perfect. When I got to the road I wanted to keep going, but I turned and walked to the hostel. Regardless of the weather, I needed a shower. And laundry. Good lord, I needed laundry. My poor feet look abused. 
They welcomed me in and I right away got a nice hot shower, then put on loaner clothes so mine could get washed. With JD's resupply run yesterday I didn't need to buy things in town, but I looked through the hiker box. I used a bottle of liquid bandage on my toes, and I ate two servings of fruit salad and one of butterscotch pudding. And a ton of animal crackers. I forced myself away from the food and back up to the bunks. 
I intended to take it easy to let sore feet and abraded skin heal. I read some information on the hostel's history and on one of the owners' thruhike. I don't think I slept, but I wasn't quite awake, either. 
In late afternoon they dropped me off in Front Royal at the Blue Wing Frog for dinner. The food was pretty great. I got a Cuban sandwich. Afterward he told me that the only thing they didn't do themselves was the cheese. They made the bread, pickles, and mustard, and they roast the pork. The care showed. I devoured my sandwich. 
While I waited for a ride back, I went to a gas station for a frozen drink, and saw they had Toffifay. I hadn't had that candy in forever. Despite my thoughts about maybe having a pint of ice cream tonight, I picked up the candy. It, too, was delicious. 
My stay here at Mountain Home Cabbin (spelled that way as it was in the diary of the daughter of the man who built it) has been very nice. The prices are extremely reasonable, the place is clean and comfortable, and the owners are very hiker friendly. I recommend it for sure.","

I'm feeling glum today. I look at the world around me and I say ""Meh"". I was so excited to get to Shenandoah, but now I'm here and I'm not feeling it. Perhaps it's the impending week of rain. Perhaps it's the dull white sky. Whatever the reason, the miles came hard today. 
Tonight I'm at Gravel Spring Hut, the northernmost shelter in the park. I've stayed here on many occasions and in all seasons. Frequently I've stayed here alone. Although at least two people are setting up camp somewhere in the sites uphill of the shelter, I may have the shelter to myself.  Not that I particularly want it to myself. 
There were a few high points today. Lisa made me very nice French toast and sat with me while I ate. I saw a white bird looking out at a view, and had quite a long one sided conversation with it. I enjoyed seeing Hogwallow Flats again. I saw many new campsites by the trail and thought about stopping at most of them. 
Maybe I have post-JD letdown. I'm usually a little glum after we part. 
The mornings have started getting cold enough to make me want gloves to start in. This morning I wanted them, but not badly enough to dig them out of my pack. Once I start walking it takes more than minor discomfort to make me stop and deal with my pack. 
I'll see how tomorrow's rain goes. There is a hostel I could potentially go to to get dried out. Maybe even slackpack. That's a very civilized way to handle rainy days.","

Once my subconscious got over the possibility of bears, I slept just fine. The nights have gotten a little warmer and I wasn't chilly. At 6 I heard a sound and it woke me enough to check my watch. I decided to get up and hike as much as I could before it started raining. I would also hike after it rained, but it would be nice to be more comfortable during some of the miles. 
I put the rain cover on my pack and put all of my rain gear into pockets I could reach easily. Then I set off, still wearing my headlamp. The sun was obscured by the cloud cover, but it gradually got more light out so that I could shut off my lamp. 
Within a mile I started seeing patches of blue sky. The predicted rain evaporated into a beautiful fall day. I was confused but happy. The sun streamed down and my mood lifted. I am SO solar powered. Remind me not to move to a cloudy place. 
I arrived at Elkwallow Wayside at 10.  I immediately ordered a breakfast sandwich and then shopped for some groceries while I waited for it. I hurried the shopping, trying to be done before the sandwich.  At 10 on a Tuesday the shop wasn't busy so there was no line to check out. I figured I would sort things out while I ate and then go back for what I had missed. 
My egg sandwich and hash browns were not the best I've ever had, but they still hit the spot. I ate them and sorted my food while also chugging a coke. I had bought a tiny bottle of instant coffee which I poured into a little plastic bag so I could discard the jar. Everything else went directly into my food bag. A couple of breakfasts, some salty snacks, bulgogi flavor jerky, and a Backpackers Pantry meal that probably wouldn't taste as good as it sounded. 
On my second trip in I got more salty snacks and a 500 ml box of Cabernet Sauvignon. I might be thruhiking but I'm still civilized. Red wine goes well with freeze dried beef. 
I felt great all afternoon, hiking steadily along familiar trails in my favorite park. I was nostalgic as I noted places I had hiked with DeLee, JD, and Just Blue Skies. I played leapfrog with another hiker as we took breaks at different spots. 
Approaching Pass Mountain, I entertained the thought of moving on to Byrd's Nest #3. But as I got to the hut, my feet felt sore and I was tired. I knew that I could make the next place, but as it wasn't an emergency I wasn't going to drive myself into the dirt. After all I had been walking for about eight hours. Less with my egg sandwich stop I suppose. But enough. 
I found Bill in the shelter, and Louie arrived shortly after. They turned out to be extremely good company. I'm sad they are headed north and I won't see them again but I very much enjoyed eating dinner with them. 
Bill said a couple with a baby were supposed to be staying at this hut tonight, so I set up my tent and moved my stuff to it. As of 7, no couple and no baby. I expect it'll rain tonight, too. If I had not set up my tent, either it would not rain or those folks would have arrived. Or both.","

I thought my bearanoia was overkill, but it turned out to be just enough kill. 
I woke up in the dark at six. I wanted to get more sleep, but my body insisted that it was time to get up. Grumbling, I sat up and started dressing. It had rained much of the night, but it was a gentle rain and I had not even needed to close the doors to the tent. It was warmer, too, so getting up was more comfortable than it had been recently. 
Following my routine when I'm not camped alone in wilderness, I packed up everything including the tent so I could take my whole pack up to the shelter to eat breakfast. Once that was done, I went to the bear pole to get my food bag. A quite small juvenile bear was standing by the pole and was not interested in leaving. I got it to move ten feet or so off into the bushes so I could retrieve my bag. 
I told Bill and Louie about the bear, then we all ate breakfast at the shelter. I heard no untoward sounds, but when Louie went to take down his tent, he came back unhappy with arms full of ruined gear. He had left his tent door open and no food in the tent. The bear had destroyed the tent and his sleeping pad, and had absconded with Louie's Platypus water bag and it's attached filter. Louie's trip ended right there. He handled it better than I would have, for sure. I was extremely glad that my own habits had paid off, as I walked away with all of my gear intact. 
I'm not sure how we missed the sounds of the poles of Louie's tent breaking. That juvenile bear had some advanced ninja bear skills. 
I walked in a cloud most of the day. It wasn't raining, but moisture filled the air. I was on edge about bears, for some reason. Walking up to Mary's Rock I ran into a couple retreating from a bear they couldn't scare off the trail. They gave up and were backtracking to their car. Fortunately it was gone when I got there. But when I stopped for lunch a while later, I found my eyes darting around, looking for dark lumbering figures come to steal my beef jerky. Relaxing. 
Between bears and the possibility of more rain, I decided to get a room at Skyland. And a burger and fries and a beer. And another beer. And some dessert. 
Despite fairly low mileage on fairly easy trail, my feet hurt. I'm not sure if it's my shoes or my arches. Taping seems to help. I tried taping my left foot yesterday and it was comparatively better. I'll tape my right foot tomorrow so it doesn't feel left out.","

I didn't want to leave the womb. Overnight the wind was fierce, driving leaves or branches against the wall of my room and rattling the door in its frame. I was safe and warm and I didn't want to get up. Finally as the alarm clock by my bed neared 7 AM, I gave in. 
First order of business was coffee. As it brewed I quickly dressed to ward off the chill of the stone floor. I ate the breakfast I had purchased yesterday. I looked on Facebook for updates. I checked the weather. I played games on my phone. Clearly I wasn't motivated to rush out and hike. 
The clock rolled over to 8 and I accepted that I would need to leave eventually. I packed up all my gear, took my phone off the charger, and faced the day. Quite a nice day actually, as it turned out. I turned in my room key and set out. 
Once again on a predicted rainy day, the weather was beautiful. The terrain was gentle and the miles rolled by quickly. Before I knew it, I was at Big Meadows. I walked to the wayside and bought food, which I ate under threatening skies. It seemed more likely to rain so I tried to pick up the pace. I did the 8-ish miles to the shelter in about 3 hours. That is radically fast for me. 
At the shelter I met JD, Coach, and Froggy. We had a good time chatting over dinner. JD and Coach are headed for Georgia so I might actually see them again. I felt an affinity to Froggy but she's on a northbound section, sadly for me. We all discussed recent bear incidents in the park. Apparently other hikers were bluff charged at Pass Mountain Hut. I'm glad that didn't happen to me! I've been bluff charged before and it's scary. I hate to say it but I'll be glad to be back in territory where they hunt bears.","

It was a beautiful day again. I started my morning with coffee and a honeybun, said seeya to the others, and headed out. First stop: Lewis Mountain Camp Store in one mile. I hadn't been at Lewis Mountain in a long time. I forgot how much I liked it. If I were to choose a campground to stay at in Shenandoah, it would be Lewis Mountain. 
I purchased two cokes - one to drink and one to carry. I also got peach slices in juice and some hummus. I ate the peach slices sitting on the bench and stowed the hummus for lunch. I heard a tale of woe at the register. The checkout computer had lost its hard drive last week, while their IT guy was on vacation far away. A replacement had been cobbled together but didn't work well. I know exactly how these things go. I listened sympathetically. 
Before I left I stopped to use their restroom, which for a miracle was both private and heated. Heated! Such a luxury that felt like to me. Clean and dry and warm. Just like I would like to be. I don't expect to be particularly clean or dry for a while. Warm is when I sweat walking uphill. 
I met Silky Pete today. He's another southbound thruhiker, but he's planning to get off the trail in two weeks. We played leapfrog as he walked faster but apparently took longer breaks. 
My legs ached and my feet hurt extra special. The first two metatarsals of my right foot felt a little out of place and stuck at their proximal ends. It hurt quite a bit so I stopped, took my shoe off, and moved my foot all around to try to work things back into place. It worked, but then the third and fourth metatarsals started hurting feeling jammed up at their distal ends. For a wonder my fifth felt okay, despite being the one I had thoroughly broken and healed a little crooked. 
As usual the last few miles were a little harder. Despite that I rolled up to the shelter at four. It was jam packed so I set up my tent in the tenting area beyond the shelter, where I also found Coach and JD. I left the tent empty to dry out a bit from my wet night at Pass Mountain Hut. I swapped my shoes for crocs and designated an unused tentsite as my camp kitchen, since the hut's table was in use. 
I let my tortellini soak for twenty minutes in hot water, which gave me plenty of time to try to text JD. No joy on the cellular signal front. Also, hiking with somebody named JD is going to be a little confusing in my journal, I can tell. Maybe I should give hiker JD and alias. Maybe my JD should be Mr Joy. 
I think by the time I leave this park, my clothes may be able to stand on their own. I better make sure my stay in Waynesboro in a few days involves a laundry stop. Between dirt and sweat, my clothes are sticky and uncomfortable right now. They haven't reached the state of salty sandpaper yet, but it's only a matter of time.","

I love my tent. I sleep so well in it. But sometimes I set it up on a hill that is imperceptible to the eye. My prone body can perceive it, and I spend the night sliding downhill faster or slower depending on the tilt. Last night was a slow slide night. 
It was all right, though. I scooched uphill periodically and otherwise slept well. 
When I got up to visit the woods in the night, I managed to encounter stinging nettles with my butt. That was my first butt related incident today. The second one was during the day, when I put a hand out to steady myself on a tree. The tree fell over and so did I, right on my butt. 
Butts aside, my hiking day went great. I only went six miles, then I stopped at a gap to wait for Cody. She was driving approximately past where I'm hiking so she kidnapped me briefly from the trail and took me out to lunch. It was so great to see her! We had a great meal, catching up, then she drove me back to the trail. 
Two miles later I ended my day. Our options for today were 8 mikes or 20. 20 isn't an doable for me so 8 it is. JD's friend Cujoe had brought a fried chicken feast to the shelter with plenty to share, so I ate another good meal.

Man I slept like crap. I just couldn't get comfortable. I tossed and turned for hours. When I woke up I felt like I'd been in a car crash. As I started moving around I felt the familiar hot coal in my spine. Hadn't had that in a while, and hadn't missed it. I took some Advil, which I don't usually do. 
I was grumpy due to pain but I got walking. Between motion and Advil I felt better soon. I started noticing that it was very pretty around me. Yellow leaves are falling and carpeting the trail in gorgeousness. I wouldn't mind a little chillier weather to go with the fall leaves. I was sweating like a champ in the warm, humid air. 
We stopped at Loft Mountain camp store for sandwiches and supplies. I heard a male hiker shouting and he stormed off, leaving his partner. I went out to check on her but she was gone by then. I hope she's all right. I also witnessed a dog fight. A dog leapt out a car window and attacked another dog who was on a leash. There was a lot of sound and fury. Not sure who much damage was done to the aggressor but the victim was okay. I was shaken by the sudden violence even though I wasn't involved. When I left there to hike again, I heaved a sigh of relief and felt a wave of calm envelop me as I saw the first white blaze. 
The sky grew dark but I prevented rain by putting my pack cover on. The trail continued being beautiful, especially as I walked around the summit of Blackrock. 
The shelter tonight is pretty packed with thruhikers and section hikers. I guess I'm in another hiker bubble. It's nice to have the company. I'll be sad to part ways with folks when I go home for a day this weekend.","

I fell in love with Shenandoah nearly thirty years ago. I came here so often that it became overly familiar and I gradually forgot how amazing it is. Coming here from Maine which is beautiful but often treacherous, I have been reminded how much I love this park. The trails are gentle, there are flowers everywhere even in fall, and I've seen more wildlife here daily than I've seen anywhere in the last 1200 miles. 
As I walk into the sunlight I feel it lift up my heart, lightening the load on my feet. Today is so perfect that I am suffused with love - for the trail, for my husband, for my family and friends. Every mile that I walking I feel myself unclenching, gradually losing my grip on my tensions, my fears, my anxieties and angers. It feels like little fingers are teasing apart the knots in the ropes around my soul, as if with enough time I could be completely free and open. 
I wonder if this is how people feel in therapy, or meditation, or prayer. I think that the trail may be all of those things to me. 
Today I have the rare feeling of rolling the earth as a giant ball under my feet. It's a feeling of connectedness. I'm an ant on the surface of the planet. It doesn't notice me, but I feel its giant presence next to me like a comforting hand holding mine.","

The hills into town were surprisingly steep this morning. I was soaked in sweat very early on. Me and my clothes have felt gross and sticky for days. The 100% humidity means that nothing ever really dries. At least it's not cold, so it's gross but not uncomfortable. 
I was pleased to see Stanimal, JD, and Coach still at Rockfish Gap when I got there. I caught a ride to the hostel and immediately showered. It was a pleasure to watch the dirt swirling down the drain. And to be clean, of course. The three of us hikers started a load of laundry as soon as we had showered. We were all eager to have clean clothes again. 
In the meantime we wore loaner clothes from the hostel. Stanimal stopped in to see if we wanted a ride to a restaurant, to which we enthusiastically agreed. He dropped us off at E&J's Deli Pub. I ate there last year with Ziptie and the food was great. It was great again today. 
Mystical had joined us for the trip. We all walked over to the Kroger. Coach is leaving us so he wandered, but JD and I needed to resupply. He'll be slackpacking this next section, while I carry my pack. It's going to take some doing to catch up with him again after my visit home this weekend. His slackpacking will put him even farther ahead of me. Ah, well. It'll give me a reason to hike harder. 
I piddled around the hostel this evening, doing little chores like washing my cook kit and re-taping my feet. I'm glad this bunch isn't big on tv, so that isn't blaring in the background. I like conversation but tv will drive me out of a room.","

I didn't sleep incredibly well. Between the roar of the dehumidifier and the thin bunk mattress, I wished I were in my tent instead. But the hostel had served many important needs for me, so I'm still glad I went. And I got to see Mystical again, and share a last evening with Coach - and possibly a last evening with JD. 
I was one of a few who set an alarm. We usually wake with the sun, but we didn't have natural light. As my alarm and then two others started chiming, we all stirred and started dressing. JD got up and started a pot of coffee brewing. Before long we were all caffeinated and fed. I packed up the little that wasn't already in my pack and headed upstairs to get my shuttle back to Rockfish Gap with Nalgene Ninja and Damn Fool. 
We got started hiking at about 7:30. The first five miles blew by quickly. Walking up Humpback Mountain was more slow. We all were forced to take a long break at a spring as it was dripping slowly and we all needed water. We used Damn Fool's cook pot to catch the drops and gradually filled our water containers, a half liter at a time. 
Near the top of the mountain, it started to rain. I had been hot all day so I put on my pack cover but didn't bother with rain gear. I let the sides of my hat down to cover my ears though. It's always nice to walk in the rain in a broad brimmed hat. 
I got to my planned tent site around 3:30 and didn't want to stop. So I kept walking in the rain. I reached Dripping Rock to find it not dripping. Water has been quite scarce. I don't think it rained enough today to make much difference. I was all right as I still had 3 liters (which is to say 6 pounds of water that I carried all the way over the mountain), but the guys were running low. I told them if they couldn't find water to come find me and I'd share. 
I walked on, looking for the site I used near here in 2010. The sky dimmed and my energy drained. I slipped around on the wet rocks as I trudged onward, looking for a place to lay my head. Finally I found a place behind some large rocks. I put up my tent and hung a bear line. I'm on a tilt so I padded under the downhill side to make my sleeping pad level-ish. Crashing in the woods made me abort my dinner plans and hang my food. 
As I was getting settled in my tent I heard hiking poles and called out. It was Nalgene Ninja. I got out and showed him where I thought we could fit another tent for Damn Fool. Nalgene Ninja hammocks so he didn't need a flat spot, just some handy trees. Now we're all three home for the night. It's nice to have company, even if it's basically night already. My subconscious will settle down and let me sleep better with people here. 
Now to wait for my legs to unclench so I can sleep. That was a long dang day.","

I slept long and hard. I was determined to sleep in after my long day, and I did. For a whole extra thirty minutes. Then I caught sight of clear shapes outside my tent when I rolled over, and my brain turned on. I tried to fall back asleep but it was too late. I gave up, grumbling, and got up to get my food bag out of the tree. My rope got stuck as I was pulling the loose end out. I fooled with it for a minute and then decided to leave it be until after coffee and better light. 
Nalgene Ninja helped me get the rope out by bending the branch down close enough to the ground to pull the rope loose. Yay for help! 
I found my old campsite .3 miles away. In 2010 there was room for one tent. In 2017 there is room for at least three, with another site cleared across from it on the west side of the trail. Somebody has even built a sizable fire pit. I've been seeing a lot of this kind of campsite growth in the south. 
At Maupin Field shelter I stopped for water and met Lost Cookie. I wasn't in a hurry today, so I sat and chatted with him while he made breakfast. He gifted me with some fresh spinach, then left for his 26 mile day. I soon followed him for my 12 miles. When I think of how tired I feel after my lower mileage days, it always stuns me that there are people out there doing double or triple what I do in a day. Or more!
I was definitely tired today after yesterday. Both days were hot and humid, adding to my fatigue. The hike up Three Ridges wasn't horrible, though. I wonder if there has been a trail relocation. The guide shows a very steep section, and I remember one, but it wasn't there today. Just a gradual climb. 
The south face of Three Ridges is different too, but I think that is just from new plant growth. In 2010 much of the switchback area was exposed, with views out across the valley. Now there are young trees blocking the view - and providing welcome shade. 
I found the guys at Harper Creek shelter. We all ate and then headed out the last three miles to the Tye River to camp. There is no real reason for me to get here tonight rather than tomorrow, but the company is good. And the shelter smelled a bit mousey so I was going to tent at either place. 
I put Lost Cookie's spinach in with a package of kimchi ramen. It was delicious. 
In the morning I'll laze about until my husband comes to fetch me home for a crab feast and time with friends. Then he'll drop me back off at the trail to head south again, starting by tackling The Priest. Only 832 more miles to go!","

The crab feast was a thing of beauty. I ate until I was bored (and then went home and continued eating other food). It really should be called a crab and beer feast. I had a *lot* of different beers as well as mead and a little scotch. JD made sure I drank water too. I had a great time. Some of my closest friends came too. For a Marylander, there isn't much better than sitting around of a beautiful afternoon with crabs and beer and your best friends. 
Unfortunately things were more somber at home. My cat isn't at what I would consider the active dying stage, because he still eats with enthusiasm. But he is barely moving at all. Clearly he is in pain. We are trying to get pain treatment for him but it is complicated by his health history and liver damage. If we can't ease his suffering that way, we'll take steps to end it permanently. I'm heartbroken. I doubt I'll see him again. I'm glad I got the chance this weekend, although he wasn't present enough to commune with. 
This morning we got a bit of a late start but finally arrived at the trailhead just before noon. I kissed my husband goodbye and started up the four mile climb that is the priest. My sweat smelled like beer. Which was a little nice actually. With a mild hangover, my hiking felt more strenuous than it should have. When I finally got to the top I decided to spend the night here. 
I'll have company tonight - sobo hiker Redbeard. It was looking like I'd be solo so I was glad to see him. I'm in the shelter due to the rain of acorns (I don't need any more holes in my tent) but I sleep poorly when solo in a shelter. I was prepared to suck it up but it's nice not to have to.","

Mrs Joy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578665,"9/25Hog Camp Gap14.3 miles
I've never experienced anything like this hail of acorns. It's been weeks and they're still falling. I've primarily stayed in shelters to save my tent, but sometimes that isn't an option. I've patched multiple holes in the cuben fiber material. I started to regret having such a fragile tent, but at least it's easily patched. I'm not sure that a silnylon tent wouldn't also be damaged. And that's a lot harder to fix. 
I only saw one person today - Redbeard. I left the shelter before him, but he caught up within an hour or two. By then I had already managed to get off trail twice by accident. This is unusual for me. The blazing here isn't spectacular. 
It was a day of little ups and downs. I lost track of the small hills that I climbed. They were cumulatively tiring. By late afternoon I was stopping frequently on uphills. I knew I was about done for the day. When I got to Hog Camp Gap with both water and campsites, I called it good. First I trekked the .3 miles downhill to find water. There was a small but clear spring. A bear had crapped in the flow, which seems rude to me. The crap was downhill from the pool from which I gathered water so I'm telling myself it's fine. Either way I filtered it like usual, and don't really have other treatment options. If I get bear flu this week, we'll know why. 
There is a dirt road nearby. I heard a car around six.  Young, excited voices broke the stillness. I think they must have climbed Cole Mountain. The didn't come camp here in my meadow. I'm happy about that. They were boisterous and loud. Probably would have kept me up late. 
The meadow is home to a thriving population of buzzing insects, in addition to its oaks. Despite the lack of people, I'll be glad for my earplugs.","

I woke up to brisk air and snuggled down under my quilt, contented to sleep in a little. The next time I opened my eyes, color was staining the sky. Oh yeah! I had set my tent up last night oriented so that I could watch the dawn. And so I did. 
As the sky turned pink and blue I stretched and then dressed. Given the bears and bear scat I've seen recently, I packed everything before getting my food down out of the tree. When I'm solo I like to be mobile when food is around. But breakfast happened without intruders. I enjoyed my latte and honey bun in peace. 
I had forgotten how very pretty Cole Mountain is. The north side is very ferny and grassy and open under the trees, then at the top is the first big bald of the south. I walked on and on, stunned that I could have forgotten this mountain. I guess when I was walking north through here, I was pretty preoccupied with thoughts of mortality after finding the dead hiker at Cornelius Creek. But today I was not, and I witnessed the mountain's beauty. 
The day got unpleasantly warm as I walked down the mountain. Even walking in the shade along the Brown Mountain Creek it was hot. I accumulated the inevitable patches of heat rash under my clothes. When I found the rare flowing water source, the water I spilled on myself felt good. 
I got water for the night from the Pedlar River. It smelled awful. I wrinkled my nose but there wasn't much I could do. I had to have water. Then it turned out that my guide was wrong - the camping near the river was .2 north, not .2 south. I had already passed it.  I kept walking, looking for a flat spot. Before I found that, I found a flowing spring. Yay! I tossed the nasty water and refilled my reservoir with cold, clear, good-smelling water. A tenth of a mile later I saw a saddle of land and went to investigate. At the crest of the saddle, way back in the woods,  I found a fire ring and a decent tent site. I put up my tent, hung a bear line, and ate a handful of jerky. It's too hot and I'm too tired to think about making pasta. 
I brushed my teeth and hung my toothpaste with my food. I tossed all the rest of my gear into my tent and followed it in, only to discover ants. Apparently they had found my pack while it was on the ground. I killed a few dozen and think it's unlikely that I've gotten them all. Frigging ants. 
Despite the fact that I'm in a usually quiet type of pine woods, things are falling constantly. It keeps setting off my sentries. I hope my trusty earplugs block enough sound that I sleep well. It felt like a long day to me and I'm tired. If I don't get a lot of sleep, tomorrow will be a bear. 
Not sure if I'm going to Glasgow tomorrow night or the following morning. I'm not super interested in a town stay, but maybe it would be good to be around people and in AC for a bit.","

Apparently I got all the ants. At any rate they didn't bother me anymore. 
I got up for one last visit to water a tree, and after that my headlamp flaked out. Luckily I didn't need to get up again, but I had wanted to check my map for something. Instead I accepted that it would be a dark night and I went to sleep. In the morning I tried the headlamp again and it worked. I don't know what's going on with it but I don't trust it now. 
The sun isn't coming up until after 7 now and as a consequence I'm not hiking until 8. I'm going to have to start setting an alarm I guess. I don't really want to. I like waking up when I'm ready. But I think my options soon will be getting up in the dark or arriving at camp in the dark, and finding a campsite and a branch for my bear line in the dark can be quite a trial. 
It was in the 90's today. I was suffering. I trudged uphill in the heat, stopping often. My heat rash is pretty ugly.  I drank a lot but still had moments of feeling dehydrated and overheated. I'm grateful that it looks like the hot weather will break soon. 
I sat at the top of Bluff Mountain to talk to lasher Obsidian for a while. I enjoyed meeting her but not so much the sunburn I got. Stupid redhead skin. On my way down I stopped at the Ottie Cline Powell monument for a moment. Every time I wonder how a 4 year old found his way 7 miles, to the top of a mountain, all by himself. How sad for all involved. 
My afternoon was a blur of heat. I just wanted to get to town and get a shower. I was happily surprised when my shuttler was JD (the hiker). He's helping out at the hostel for a few days following the untimely death of one of the caretakers. I was stunned to hear of his death. His new widow is bearing up remarkably well. I don't think I'd be handling reality well in her situation. 
I met Ghost Hiker at the hostel, and Redbeard is staying here too. It's a nice bunch. I feel like I'm barely here for 10 minutes. I think it actually will be about 13 hours. A whirlwind trip when you consider the chores I do while in town. As usual I seem to have too much food. I got bagels and they're bulky despite my efforts to mash them. I think I'll be hanging them in a plastic bag the first night. I'm going to look like a newby.","

I slept well in my bunk. I followed Ghost Hiker's example and inflated my air mattress to supplement the thin bunk mattress. I worried that the sound of me moving on it might disturb Ghost Rider, but she said it didn't. I think she has good ear plugs. 
We all ate breakfast together, then JD drove us back to the trail. I got out of Ghost Hiker's way and she sped off. I was fine with that. Most people are faster than me. What I was NOT okay with was the hiker I met hours later. As he approached, he asked if I were Mrs Joy. Ghost Hiker had told him about me. He made a point of telling me ""She's way ahead of you. No, I mean WAY ahead of you."" Is there any point to that kind of comment other than to point out my relative slowness? I have no idea why it matters. I don't know him, and I just met her yesterday and wasn't trying to keep up with her. The more I thought about it, the more annoyed I got. Ah well. Too late for a snappy comeback now. 
It was warm again today. I felt every one of my pack's 27 pounds as I climbed the 2500 feet of elevation gain leaving town. My pack felt awkward. I picked up bagels in town and they were bulky, although not heavy. My food didn't all fit in my food bag. I left the extra in a plastic grocery bag at the top of the pack. 
Section hikers left unopened salami at the hostel last night, so I had salami and cream cheese on a bagel for lunch. It was spectacular. Some capers and onion wouldn't have gone amiss either. I'm pretty sure the grocery / hardware store in Glasgow didn't have capers. 
At 4 I arrived at Harrison Ground Spring, which has the only water for miles in either direction. I was tired and there is camping here, so I made it my home for the night. Thunder Hill shelter has minimal water at the best of times. I'd rather stay here where I can get as much as I want, rather than carry several extra liters to Thunder Hill. Especially as my venerable Platypus bag has sprung a leak. I checked my repair kit and I still have some platypatches - of equally venerable age. It will be interesting to see if they still work. I'll need to dry the bag well first. I guess. If the patches ever had instructions, they are long since gone. 
With my evening spare time I made a satisfying dinner of loaded mashed potatoes, liberally topped with bacon bits. I sat on a good sitting rock, gazing out into the forest as I happily ate my dinner. It suddenly occurred to me how I could squash the rest of the bagels so that everything would fit in my food bag. I spent the rest of dinner sitting on bagels (inside their slightly open ziplock bag). It worked like a charm. They are very flat now. 
I just looked up and found another hole in my tent. I patched it of course, but I suspect that the next time it rains I'm going to find more. The holes are only visible from certain angles and in dim light, which makes them hard to search for. 
It started to feel pleasantly cool while I ate dinner. For the first time in weeks my wool long underwear and my sleeping bag feel good. I look forward to some snuggly sleeping tonight.","

Something raised a mild ruckus around 3 AM, thrashing through the undergrowth and breaking twigs. I finally made some noise to scare it off so I could sleep. I didn't begrudge it any of the greenery, but did it have to be so loud?
I woke up for good at 6, ready to get on with my day. But it was still dark out and my headlamp is on its last legs, so I waited a few minutes for a bit more ambient light. I watched a tinge of red creep over the horizon. When I looked down I could see leaves on the ground. Probably good enough. I started changing into my hiking clothes, mostly by feel. I didn't discover until much later that one sock was on inside out - not that it mattered much. 
Given the level of animal activity, I packed everything else prior to fetching down my food bag. But the early morning seemed peaceful, and my breakfast was uninterrupted. It was chilly enough to want a hot drink, so I boiled water and made myself a mocha. I watched the treetops light up as the first rays of sun shone over the ridge. By the time I finished breakfast and left, the rays had nearly reached the ground. 
When I picked up my hiking pole from the rock where it leaned overnight, I found that some mouse or squirrel had nibbled all the way around the hand grip at the top and the bottom. It's annoying but there's nothing to be done for it. At least it doesn't impede my grip. 
My first stop at Thunder Hill Shelter proved that the spring was indeed bone dry. I headed on to Cornelius Creek, where I found a small dam holding water deep enough to dip my cup into so I could fill my water bag. I noticed that the platypatch had not worked particularly well. It's good enough for getting water in camp but my pack will get wet inside if I need to carry water very far. Perhaps in Daleville I can find something to replace it. Unfortunately the threads on the necks of newer Platypus bags don't match the threads of the Sawyer filters, so another Platypus bag isn't an option. 
I ate lunch at the picnic table of the Cornelius Creek Shelter. It was peaceful and the weather was beautiful, that particular kind of blue sky and barely crisp air that has always been my favorite fall weather. 
The terrain was quietly spectacular on my afternoon walk to Bryant Ridge. The trail wound around steep side hills, with picturesque views down into pine hollows. I felt like I ought to be doing something more to appreciate it, but I don't know what. I tried, but I'm not a good enough photographer to do it justice. I tried to soak it up as well as I could. 
I was pleased to find a puddle of fresh water to dip from at the shelter. It was a little silty, but I can't afford to have high standards at the moment. It tasted fine after I filtered it. I boiled water to make more mashed potato and bacon. The meal that delighted me last night was unappealing tonight. I ate it slowly, unenthusiastically spooning it into my mouth until it was mostly gone. Finally there was just a little left - little enough that I don't mind carrying the remains. With relief I stowed it in my trash bag. I brushed my teeth and put food and toothpaste up on one of the grappling hooks hanging in the shelter. There are few low branches here and the hooks look official. If they're not where you're supposed to hang your food, somebody has at least done a good job of making them look as if they are. Nevertheless it makes me a little uncomfortable. I don't usually hang food in a shelter unless there is another person in it with me. 
This shelter is huge. It sleeps twenty. As usual I'm creeped out by being here alone. I hope I'm able to sleep well despite that. Weird that my subconscious is fine with my tent alone in the woods, but not an empty shelter. At any rate it's nice to have a roof over my head and water and a privy handy.","

I slept soundly. Omega arrived after dark, and his presence set my mind at ease. I got up well before the sun came up, as the cold pre-dawn temperature and the fullness of my bladder conspired against me. I rolled up my pad and sleeping bag, but left the rest until after breakfast so I could bother Omega the least amount possible. 
We chatted about gear for a bit, then I wished him safe journey and headed south. It was cold enough to hike in my windbreaker. Gloves might have been nice. For the first mile before sunshine reached me, my hands and feet were a little numb. As soon as I hit sunshine (and a steeper incline) I removed the windbreaker and was comfortable. 
The day's hike included some pretty stunning views, including the Peaks of Otter. I stopped a few times to appreciate. 
At 5 I arrived at the shelter, got water, and started making a Knorr pasta side. It was horrible. Just after I finished it, a man with no backpack walked down to the shelter. The trail to the shelter is egregiously long, so I didn't suppose he got there by accident. He introduced himself as Fresh Ground and said that if we were willing to walk back up to the road he'd cook for us. 
Having just eaten, and being tired, it took me a bit to decide. But I figured I might as well. I've been very hungry the last couple of days - eating all my snacks and wishing I could have two sandwiches at lunch. I stowed my food bag in a tree and followed him up to an overlook. He cooked up thick bacon for bacon and tomato sandwiches with his mom's home grown tomatoes. I sliced up a potato and he deep fried it into French fries for me. He had soda and ice and all sorts of things. Two other hikers joined us. Being male, they managed to eat more. I was already super happy with my sandwich and fries and declined more. 
He invited us back for breakfast in the morning. I couldn't say no. He was so nice and his food was so good. Fresh Ground brimmed over with the sort of joy that I love. With or without food, I like that guy. 
The shelter I'm at tonight is a lot less impressive than my second dinner was, especially compared to the trail mansion I slept in last night. It'll do, but it's no surprise that it hadn't stuck in my memory from the last time I stayed here. This deep in a hollow and on the western side of the ridge, it will be dark here until late morning. It's just as well that I've been getting up in the dark. I could be down here half the day if I waited for light. I keep the remains of my watch draped over the edge of a gear pocket at night so I can check to see if it's close enough to morning to get up. I don't want to walk in the pitch dark with my sketchy headlamp, but I don't mind getting ready for the day by Braille.","

I awoke in the dark, as usual now. Krakhead was packing up at the other end of the shelter. I started doing the same. When I got to my shoes, I was confused. I thought I had stuffed my gaiters down in the shoes, but they weren't there. My headlight was completely conked out. I waited for more daylight as I packed everything else. Finally I got up and started searching. One gaiter was on the ground in front of the shelter. One was on the ground behind the shelter. I was grateful that neither had made it into some critter's nest where I wouldn't find it. 
It was cold, so to start I wore my fleece top and my windbreaker, as well as my gloves and my buff. I walked back up to the parkway and greeted Fresh Ground. He made me three enormous and delicious banana pancakes. I was running out of room by the third. He also made coffee and gave me cokes at my request. Compass sat across from me and ate a grilled cheese sandwich. Fresh Ground is a pretty amazing human being. Camping out in the cold so you can feed hikers just because you enjoy it? That isn't something you find every day. He said that with getting well fed like this, we'd get an energy boost that would last at least a day. He was right, too. I strode away feeling like a superhero. Miles flew by. 
I stopped in at Wilson Creek Shelter to find dire messages about there being no water in the cistern at Fullhardt Knob, and no water along the way. I thought I might have to hike all the way to town. But there was in fact lots of water along the way as well as water in the cistern. People confuse me. 
I wasn't hungry at lunchtime so I rested a bit and then walked on. I grabbed two liters of water in case I needed it at the shelter. Walking with extra water wasn't extra fun. By the time I got to Fullhardt I was quite glad I didn't have to walk five more miles. 
It feels colder tonight. Another hiker has made a fire, which is nice. I'm starting to think I might want more warm gear than my heavier sleeping bag soon. A little fleece cap for daytime wear plus my down miniskirt sound really good right now. Maybe down booties as well. 
I'm looking forward to a short day into town tomorrow. I'll have to do some walking in town of course. But laundry and shower and restaurant food! And more food! And dessert! Man those sound good. 
That reminds me. Fresh Ground gave me a headlamp. I told him about mine, and he said he had one and he'd been waiting for someone to give it to. That's the sort of thing I'd do. In fact I gave away my spare light to Nalgene Ninja because his headlamp died. So instead of declining like I usually would, I gratefully accepted it. This time of year a headlamp really makes a difference.","

Last night my sleeping pad deflated. I reinflated it at 3 AM, and by 5 I was pretty much on the ground again. Pad #6 was already shipped and waiting for me in town, so the timing was excellent. I'm still flabbergasted that I've managed to ding up another pad somehow. I noticed it feeling a little low when I woke up a few days ago, but attributed it to colder temps. I hope pad #6 makes it until the end of the trail. 
I dressed quickly in the cold morning air, staying in my sleeping bag as much as possible until I was fully clothed. Had it been just me I might have boiled water in the protection of the shelter, but with section hikers sleeping in there I moved out to the picnic table. I weighted down my pot insulator against the morning breeze as I made coffee. It was definitely not a morning for a casual cup of cold coffee. It was a morning for huddling around a warm mug. 
With a light heart and a full belly, I set off for town. The miles passed very quickly. I saw one speedy deer, which reminded me of the three slow bears I saw yesterday. Bears don't usually seem to be in much of a hurry. They are expert moseyers. 
Redbeard was just leaving the Howard Johnson when I got there. He was only going to the first shelter outside of town so perhaps I'll be able to catch up with him. The nice lady at the front desk checked me in and got me change and soap for the laundry. She said to let her know if she could do anything else. I said ""Can you smell me from here?"" I needed an honest opinion. If it was bad I'd take time for shower and laundry first, but I'd really rather do all my errands first if I could. She looked only slightly startled and said she could not. 
I deposited my pack in my room, dumped my clothes out of my little daypack, and headed for the shopping center. My agenda included lunch, the outfitter, the liquor store, the grocery store, and then lunch. Again. I've been hungry. 
At Wendy's I couldn't decide on burger vs chicken, so I ordered one of each - junior size. And fries. And a frosty. I think the frosty ended up being a mistake. 
As I was washing my hands at the Wendy's, the left temple fell off my glasses. I tried to reassemble it, but the screw was too tiny for even my little hands. I put the screw in a ziplock, the temple in a pocket, and the remains of the glasses on my face. 
At the outfitter, they asked what I needed and I said I had no idea. My glasses self destructing had discombobulated me. They took pity on me and put my glasses back together in an impressive display of dexterity, then helped me find things in the store. I now own a blaze orange buff and bandanna. No vest unfortunately. I picked up two new water bladders also. I have a feeling that throwing away my old well loved one is going to hurt. 
The liquor store sold me some of the caramel flavored liquor I discovered in New Hampshire. I bought a bottle of ginger ale into which I'll decant the liquor later. 
I was a little disappointed not to find my tortellini at the grocery, but that's alright. I bought a baguette and some Brie. That should keep me happy. I'm only carrying two days food because there's a hostel and grocery store not very far down the trail. I'll need to carry more than usual from that stop. I might have to suck it up and carry light and compact things like oatmeal and instant rice. I don't know, though. Carrying crappy food usually results in me being hungry and grumpy while my pack weight stays the same. 
The grocery also didn't have any individually packaged breakfast things. I figured I'd get that at a gas station. Sure enough, they were well stocked. 
Second lunch was at the BBQ joint nearby. It was delicious and the waitress was excellent. I tipped her a little heavily and toddled back to the motel to finally clean up. 
I haven't done laundry in public in a while. I looked in the mirror before I left my room and my rainskirt looked more transparent than I remembered. After a moment's thought, I wrapped my silk sleeping bag liner around my hips and knotted it. It made an excellent petticoat. I've been pondering ways to make it a better skirt this evening. It would need to not cause problems with its primary function. Maybe a couple of big safety pins are all that is needed. 
Around laundry time my stomach announced that I was mean, I wasn't its real mom, and it was running away from home. Maybe it was the second lunch, maybe it was the frosty. Either way, I had a time convincing it that everything would turn out fine. And even longer before I trusted it again. I decided dinner was probably unnecessary tonight. 
My glasses fell apart again when I set them down. Considering my options, I threaded the joint with dental floss for now. I can't handle the screw with the tools I have here, and I will either need a larger screw or something to thicken up the threads. I don't wear the glasses much, so a half-assed repair is fine for now. My husband suggested the classic paper clip repair, but that sounded like a good way to damage other items around my glasses as they're jammed in my bag. 
I would be more upset but I mostly function all right without the glasses, and they cost me under $10. My series of defunct sleeping pads is much more upsetting.","

Boy howdy did I not feel great when I woke up. Headache, bloody nose, backache, and cramps. Most of my discomfort was due to the elderly mattress and room heating system. Is it possible to stagger from a prone position to a seated position? It felt like I was staggering before I even left the bed. I groaned and made my way to the bathroom, where I noticed that I was also sporting a seriously tall hairdo. I rolled my puffy eyes at my reflection. 
I pulled on clothes and experimented with my buff to try to cover and/or compress my Mohawk. Giving up on any semblance of attractiveness or respectability, I jammed it over my head and left for the motel dining room. 
Nobody looked very hard at me, for which I was grateful. I ate a variety of thinks but mostly I caffeinated. Then I trekked back to the room to pack and hopefully turn back into a human being, or a least a hiker. 
Dropping off my keycard, I headed out on the trail again. I was surprised to find myself holding my own against dayhikers climbing the hill out of town. Usually the smug buggers breeze by me and my freshly loaded down pack. I sweated but I apparently was moving faster than I thought. 
They finally turned around at an overlook and I had the woods to myself again. I'd forgotten the extent of the rock scrambling on the ridge. I hadn't forgotten the pretty overlooks. It was another clear blue day, warm but not uncomfortable. I didn't race down the trail but I moved all right. 
At lunchtime I stopped at Angel Gap and ate on a rock where I've lunched before. It was a good rock, and good baguette and Brie. I ate in peace, bothered neither by hikers nor flies. The trail has been remarkably bug free of late. Only for a couple of hours in the late afternoon do the eye gnats come out. 
At Lambert's Meadow I found stagnant puddles at the shelter water source. It wasn't quite three yet, so I decided to walk on to the next shelter where I hoped the water situation would be better. I ate some snacks and rested until three, then heaved my pack up off the shelter floor once again. 
Tinker Cliffs are some of my favorite dramatic sights on the trail. There's a half mile walk along the cliff edge. The cliff itself is a little offset from the bulk of the mountain, divided by a deep cleft. Despite the lateness of the hour I took the time to stop and appreciate the view. 
I was getting tired and the sun was setting before I finally made it to the shelter. When I asked about water they said there was none. I asked if it were really dry or just not great water. Luckily it wasn't actually completely dry. I got two liters of silty water out of the water source. To be fair it's obviously normally a pretty sizable stream, not just some puddles between slabs of rock. But beggars can't be choosers, and right now I'm a beggar for sure. 
I was contemplating skipping dinner but my shelter mates offered me a freshly made burrito with rice and beans and sausage in it. The chef (seriously, he went to culinary school) toasted the tortillas over his stove flame so the burritos were warm and a little crisped. It was delicious. I thanked them for the trail magic. 
I'm about to settle in for the night on the new sleeping pad. Wish #6 some luck. Apparently it needs it.","

It got a little chilly last night but I was too dopey to use the gear I have to make myself warm. Instead I lay there awake. At least I got to see the dawn. And I felt like a million bucks when I got up. Seriously! A night in a motel = hot death. A cold night in a shelter = super girl. Go figure. 
I hotfooted it up to McAfee Knob. I had it to myself! Two guys showed up just long enough to take my picture for me and then they left. I lay down on the rock, enjoying the feel of the cool stone against my back while the sun warmed my face. Eventually I got up and sat on a rock looking out over the valley. I used the time to plan my next section so I would know how much food to buy. 
I walked on to Catawba Mtn Shelter. The water source was bone dry. Same at Johns Spring Shelter. I was starting to get nervous by the time I came down from the next ridge, but luckily Catawba Creek was flowing, if low. I found a few spots deep enough to dip from and filtered a much appreciated liter. 
In another couple of miles I turned off the trail to go to Four Pines Hostel. A trip to the local gas station/grocery later, I had dinner and food for five days. Add a shower and some electricity and I was good to go. I skipped laundry since my clothes were clean yesterday morning, but I did    wash my socks out in the sink. The dust has been terrible. The ground is hard and dry everywhere. It shows in my socks. 
Redbeard and Doodlebug were good company this evening. I got a text from JD- he's a bit behind. I was surprised to hear how many other hikers were nearby, however. As we all move down the trail, we go to the same places one after another and don't meet each other.","

The bed I slept in was super comfy for once. Unfortunately I woke up with a migraine. Stupid body. I ate my breakfast and debated taking medication. It makes me feel bad sometimes so I decided to see if caffeine would be enough today. 
I sat on my bed packing and feeling crappy. Doodlebug suggested I slackpack and come back to the hostel tonight. I didn't have to think very long before I decided to do it. Not carrying a backpack today sounded great. 
Doodlebug dropped me and Redbeard off around eight. My migraine was not gone.  But at least I wasn't carrying a heavy load. I moved slowly up the shoulder of Brush Mountain. When I got to the Audie Murphy Monument I declined to go see it, but I had a bad few minutes afterward as the trail I was on was unblazed for the better part of a mile. I was relieved when I finally saw a white blaze. 
My headache was getting worse as I started up Cove Mountain. As the afternoon progressed my energy level dropped. At the same time the terrain got more difficult, with plenty of rock scrambling along the ridge line. Despite my light load my speed dropped considerably. 
On my previous traverse I skipped the side trail to the Dragon's Tooth. I decided to go see it this time, as I don't know if I'll ever be this way again. It turns out that it's a big rock. It may have been oversold. 
The trail down the north side of the mountain was as sketchy as I remembered. I sat and scooted a bunch of times. I was super ready for the trail to go back to stuff you could just walk on. 
My head was throbbing by the time I got back to the hostel. Doodlebug saw me and told me he was worried because I took so long. Story of my life. He also asked me if I wanted to go to the Homeplace restaurant. It's sort of famous. Hiker famous anyway. But I was tired and I hurt and I did not want to sit my smelly self in a public place and make nice with strangers. 
Instead Doodlebug drove me to the Catawba grocery so I could get pizza. As soon as I had the pizza down I took my imitrex. Within a half hour or so my headache started to recede. Then Doodlebug showed up with Homeplace leftovers so I could try the food, which was super sweet. I basically ate an entire second dinner. It was decent. Not really much to write home about though. 
At the hostel tonight there are several men including Scratch, who I met at Campbell Shelter. He's a hoot.","

I didn't wake up until Doodlebug turned on the lights. I was tired. Despite the male opinion about how yesterday should have been so easy, I could feel fatigue dragging at my muscles. I briefly considered taking today off, but a blowhard was opining on pretty much everything, and I couldn't tolerate a day of that. 
I was slow to get ready and I'm pretty sure the guy waiting to take the same shuttle as me was annoyed, but he didn't say anything. We left the hostel a little after eight. I very nearly forgot to donate - I had to run back in to put money in the box. 
The hostel was bare bones. It did the job, but as one big room plus a bathroom there was minimal privacy. The bathroom had a sign on the door instructing us to pee outside on the grass. The toilet was only for solids. I had some issues with this. For one thing there were houses on either side of the hostel. For another their flock of chickens meant that an unwary step would result in gross shoes. Also, people who menstruate need more in the way of sanitary facilities than people who don't - a condition which I suspect never crossed the mind of the sign writer. 
At any rate, I got back on the trail headed south. Switching from northbound to southbound had already discombobulated my sense of direction. My one day of northbound slackpacking completely unmoored my frame of reference. The cardinal points are not instinctive for me at the moment. I am literally visualizing a compass while trying to figure out what is where. I'm consistently getting it wrong in conversation, which is annoying for both me and anybody to whom I'm trying to convey information. I hope my brain sorts it out soon. 
I reached the first shelter in under two miles. A man was asleep beside the trail within sight of the shelter. His clothes were draped on bushes and his bare feet stuck out. I wondered what his story was. Loud snorer in the shelter? Night hiking and gave up on finding the shelter? I left him sleeping as I passed. 
At the top of Sinking Creek mountain I felt a sharp pain and looked down to find dozens of little devil forks stuck in my legs. I don't know what kind of plant they came from, but they were tenacious. The tines were barbed and released my legs reluctantly. Several broke off in my pants or possibly in my thighs. I hope nothing festers. 
I ate the last of my baguette and Brie for lunch. The baguette was just starting to get stale, but it still tasted good. I'm impressed with the Brie. It was in log form, which apparently travels very, very well. I've never seen it before, but I will definitely buy it again if I see it. 
I was ready for today to end far before it did, having started already tired. It was hot out, which is always draining. My emotions were apparently set on spin, as well. I eventually started listening to music, which helped. And the evening sunlight lit up the forest to maximum beauty. It's hard to hold onto a bad mood when that happens. Also I passed the Keffer Oak today. I admired it, then placed a hand on its massive trunk and closed my eyes. It carried a feeling of immense stability and peace. I patted it and walked on. 
I carried two liters of water the last three miles in case there wasn't water at the shelter, but there was. I got another liter since I could, and immediately downed most of it. I made sure to eat dinner so I would have my best opportunity to feel good tomorrow. The meal was supposed to be Pad Thai. It bore virtually no resemblance to that dish, but fortunately it tasted good anyway. I chatted with section hikers, one of whom actually recognized me from this journal! That hadn't happened before. They're getting off the trail tomorrow and gave me some food. I have a very full bag so I didn't want much, but I accepted some drink mix and some spices. At least for now, I always want more salt. 
Tomorrow I have scheduled to be even longer than today. Help. I'm not sure if I'm an optimist or an idiot.","

The moon shone brightly enough to cast shadows from before I went to sleep until after I woke up. I pulled my cap down over my eyes to block the light so I could sleep. It was comforting to be able to look out and see things, though. My hindbrain feels much safer when it can see. 
I woke at 6:15. There were no signs of life elsewhere in camp. I was glad I had tented so I could get up without bothering anybody. I grabbed my food bag and made iced coffee to go with my honeybun. Caffeinated and full, I finished packing up and relocated to the log in front of the shelter for last minute details like tooth brushing and visiting the privy. 
By now the fellows from last night were all up - Dale, Dogtags, Stumbles, and Bubbadoodle. I took their picture standing together at the picnic table. They were a great, low key, fun bunch. When I left the other three were advising Dale, out on his first section, about ways to drop pack weight. He was fairly miserable from the weight he carried. I hope he takes the advice and becomes a happier camper. 
It's funny how fast the day goes by. I started walking, blinked, and I was at the next shelter and eating lunch. I started walking again and then it was starting to sprinkle and the sun was going down. Two blinks and a day was gone. 
I found nobody at the shelter so I kept my pack on and walked down the mountain to get water. It might have been fine at the shelter while I was away. Then again it might not. It wasn't a big deal anyway. I had already carried it nearly fifteen miles. Another half mile didn't make much difference. 
The sun had set but a little light remained when I got back to the shelter, which was still empty. I swept out a spot and set up my sleeping pad and sleeping bag. I moved my tired butt over to the pad so I had a comfier seat, then supped on bulgogi flavor beef jerky and dry ramen. Dry ramen is a disgusting habit that I picked up on one of my first long section hikes. It's essentially like eating crackers, and avoids the fuss of cooking and the mess of eating noodle soup. 
I hung my food bag from a mouse hanger in the shelter. Rain, possibly torrential rain, might be starting overnight. I checked the forecast when I briefly had a cell signal this morning, and it called for up to six inches over the next three days. At least finding water shouldn't be a problem for a while! Finding high ground might be. At any rate, I didn't want to hang the food bag in the rain. It's a dry bag, but it isn't perfect. And sodden rope is a pain to deal with. 
Tomorrow is a question mark. Forecasts calling for this much rain seldom come to fruition. If it's really that wet, I'll want to get to a shelter. The next one is closed thanks to hazardous dead trees. The one after that is over sixteen miles away. That's a very long walk for me - not that I'm prone to taking long breaks on those kinds of days, which helps. I'm honestly not sure I can make the distance before the sun goes down.  I don't remember what the footing is like. I don't particularly want to subject my headlamp to torrential rain. There are several campsites along the way. If I have to, I'll camp. I don't have much faith in my tent thanks to acorn damage, but a wet night won't kill me. Leave me pruney and grumpy, but not kill me.","

The sky was curiously light all night, even when it was raining. I kept waking up thinking it was time to get up. At 11, at 1, at 3. The weird thing is I was totally ready to get up. Finally at 6 I did get up and make breakfast. Somehow I was ready to go before it was light out. I fiddled around until I could see the ground well enough to walk. 
The predicted rain started slow and then fizzled out. I ditched my rain skirt and jacket early on and was able to walk all day in my shirtsleeves. I stopped four miles in at Pine Swamp Shelter, which had was closed to overnight use due to Gypsy Moth damage to trees in the area. I only saw one dead tree. Maybe the others already fell?
The afternoon was a long ridge slog. I met two northbound section hikers and that was it. I was happy to find a spring with a little bit of water in it. When I got to my destination, I was resigned to another solo night, but Sloth arrived an hour later. He knew about horses and yoga and physical therapy so we had a lot to talk about. I'm glad of the company even if he didn't do yoga. With bad weather coming in, it's nice to have another person here. The part where he's really nice is a bonus.","

Boy, did it rain vigorously. I don't know if we got the predicted 2-3"", but we got a lot. Plenty of wind, too. Sloth got wet in his hammock and had to move into the shelter. I stayed cozy and dry. The shelter is built with walls that end a few feet below the ceiling in front and I wondered if any rain would blow in, but it didn't. 
I woke in the dark. I guess that's my thing now. I made a mocha with one of my donated hot chocolate mixes and drank it leaning against the shelter wall. Eventually I got packed up but I wasn't in a huge hurry. 
The walk to town was uneventful. It drizzled for about half an hour, then got very, very hot. My weather app said it was 104, but I'm reasonably certain that it was exaggerating. I guess other people called the hostel for a ride, but I didn't think of that so I walked. But it meant I was in front of the pizza buffet place right at lunchtime. Perfect! I ate a bunch of salad and pizza. 
I got a room at the hostel for two nights. I'm so ready for a day of rest. And with the warm weather I desperately needed a shower and clean clothing. If there's time I'll get a chiropractic adjustment as well. My thoracic spine was been kind of jammed up for a while. Other parts could use a little help but that's the biggie. 
I found blaze orange duck tape, vest, and ball cap at the Tractor Supply store. I now have a lot of square footage of blaze orange. The rest of my hike should be very bright, and hopefully will not involve bullets. 
Before visiting the grocery I got Mexican food and learned an important lesson: do not get the 32 oz beer. It's too heavy to lift in its giant glass mug. I had to use both hands. But the beer was tasty and the food was good. Tomorrow the Chinese buffet will be open and I will be well on my way to exhausting the culinary options of Pearisburg. 
I met two kindred spirits tonight - Sail and Magpie. Sadly they're going north and I'm going south. But I enjoyed spending the evening with them, and I should get to see Sail again. She's a physics and engineering person. You know, a nerd. Like me. She's my people.","

I mailed my forty degree bag home. I'm going to miss it for a sweaty week, but then the temperature should drop. Lordy, I hope so. I have my down skirt, my down booties, and absolutely no desire to put them on. Even my thin hiking pants and shirt feel stifling. The sheet I slept under last night felt like too much. I'm ready for it to feel like October. 
I ate some just okay Chinese buffet food for lunch, then stopped in at the Food Lion again. I just couldn't stomach the idea of restaurant food for dinner again. I bought myself a rotisserie chicken, garlic infused olive oil, and butternut squash cubes. Sail made fry bread while I roasted the squash. I found minced garlic in the fridge and made garlic bread with some of the sourdough boule I bought yesterday. The chicken wasn't what I had dreamed of, but the roasted squash and garlic bread were perfect. 
Pippa aka Doc Peppa gave me a most excellent chiropractic adjustment. It's already helped foot pain I was having since falling on wet rocks a couple of days ago. I'm not sure my back will feel great until I stop carrying a pack up and down mountains every day. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.","

I packed as much as I could in the evening so the morning could be mellow. I drank coffee and ate a muffin. The muffins were on the filling side and I still had two left so I tried to give them away. I had a hard time finding takers, but Sail came in with a packet of oatmeal to eat and she was not hard to convince. I wrote ""Free"" on the box and left the last one there. Surely someone will eat it. 
Sartek (spelling a guess) drove me up to the trail crossing and I was off. The hike up to Angel's Rest wasn't bad, but it got steep enough that my calves started feeling overstretched. I did the last steep bits on the balls of my feet. It helped my calves but then the balls of my feet kinda hurt. It's always something, isn't it?
I carried not much more than a liter of water out of town, expecting to get more after the climb. I never did see the spring I was intending to use, so I was running on almost empty by the time I got to Doc's Knob. I stepped carefully down the trail of rocks to get to the spring there. The pool was small but cold and clear. I could hear the water flowing under the mossy rocks a little downhill. 
I filtered two liters and ate a little snack as I watched clouds drift by. The clouds started getting darker and greyer. Thunder rumbled. I took that as my cue to stop eating and pack up. My stomach felt a little funky too. I ate while I walked in the morning, but most of my snacks were untouched. 
I figured I was just sufficiently fed from my town experience, but it soon became apparent that it was going to be a bloat and suffer afternoon. Dang it! I was headed to Woods Hole so I would have a good place to wait for my stomach to settle, but there was no way I could eat Neville's cooking like that. And her food is worth eating. 
Neville was out when I got there. Michael showed me around. The bunkhouse has gotten nicer since I was last here. There is an entire new shower building as well. The showers are quite nice - I have new goals if I ever design my own bathroom. The water is heated by a wood fired furnace uphill from the building. The shower was deliciously warm. After I cleaned up I noticed that it was so well ventilated that it was actually unusually easy to dry off afterwards. 
I sat on a sofa on the bunkhouse porch and petted dogs for a while. It didn't help my belly but it did make me happy. The dogs appeared to enjoy it too. The dogs take their ""bark at strangers"" duty seriously, but they clearly feel that couch time is important too. 
I made a cup of miso soup and munched on a little dried fruit. Ironically, I only last night removed a packet of mint tea from my food bag. I had carried it for months without using it. I suppose it was inevitable that I immediately got an upset stomach. 
Neville came down to tell me that she was making miso soup and salad for dinner. I had to laugh. I told her I had just had miso. It was kind of her to think of me. I figure by breakfast time I'll be back to normal so I'll catch up with her then. I have plans to go up in the morning to help get the meal ready. It's so good to see her! I want to hear all about how things have been since I was here last.","

After ten solid hours of sleep, I felt like I could use four or five more. I got up anyway. Being the only person in the bunkhouse, I could get dressed without needing to conceal myself and without bothering anyone. I clambered down the steep stairs from the loft, grabbed a Dr Pepper from the fridge, and watched the sun rise. 
About seven fifteen I went and sat on the porch of the main house to wait for Neville. She let me in and I helped her make breakfast- melting butter and crushing garlic into it, browning sausage, mixing up some crepe batter. Michael picked Swiss chard out of their garden and Neville created an amazing breakfast out of all of it. 
I was glad to help and to have time to chat while we worked. With last year's yoga teacher training, I had more insight into some things. I was stunned to hear that she meditates for an hour every morning. I struggled to reach twenty minutes during my training. 
After breakfast I changed the sheets of the bed that I had used and did a couple of hostel chores. Then I was on my way. After eyeballing the sky, I stopped to put my new blaze orange pack cover on. Minutes later a hunter in full camo stepped out of the woods and I had a different reason to want that bright pack cover showing. 
I got a bit of a late start with the breakfast and all. I hadn't planned a long day, but after a few miles I decided to cut it even shorter. I felt tired and my guts still hurt, although they weren't doing anything spectacular. I got water at a spring and then stopped at Wapiti Shelter. As I sat wearily, I realized that my muscles and lymph nodes ached, and I was tired enough to sleep despite my morning caffeine. 
I inflated my mattress and lay down. It felt good to do so. I decided a short day would be a very good thing, indeed. I hope whatever virus is tormenting me is done with me quickly. I don't much like being on the trail when I'm sick. I want to curl up in my own bed with a dog or two. Lots of blankets, maybe some flannel, and a steady supply of hot beverages to drink. A sleeping bag and air mattress on a wooden floor really don't compare.","

My short day to Wapiti was looking pretty fortuitous when it started raining last night. Achilles and I hung out in the shelter watching the glow from the fire die. I curled up to sleep and Achilles decamped to his hammock nearby so I had the shelter to myself. I slept long and hard, waking in the dark to make coffee before the sun came up. 
Achilles was still snoozing when I left. I stopped to adjust my right shoe before I left. It felt like it was squeezing my first metatarsal. Of course the shoe hadn't changed. My bones were out of alignment. I massaged my foot and wiggled it around until something popped. It wasn't perfect, but it was better. 
The morning was over mostly level ground, so it was easy and pleasant walking. I walked very carefully on the many footbridges. In 2010 I wiped out pretty hard on one of them. Wet today from rain and leaves, they were quite slick. I treated them like ice, trying to center my weight over each foot. I did slip stepping off one, but luckily my weight was already on the other foot. 
I ran into Silly Spilly, Tenacious D, and Shoo Bear at Dismal Creek. I quickly lost sight of them on the curving trail and didn't see them again. 
I was pleased to find myself feeling much better after my afternoon off. My guts weren't hurting and I had more energy. I expect to be back to 100% tomorrow. Unfortunately that's 100% of a middle aged, fairly decrepit woman rather than a 20 year old athlete, but it's way better than what I was yesterday. 
I skipped Trent's Grocery as I was already carrying plenty of food. I sat on a rock to eat some lunch at the foot of a bridge. Achilles caught up and joined me to eat. I filtered the water I had been carrying for miles. It's still dry out here. There is water available but it's wise to carry more with me than I really enjoy. The recent rain has surely helped, though. I can find nice clear, freely flowing water to drink rather than the silty puddles I was finding before. 
My right foot started hurting more at the end of the day. I arrived at Jenny Knob and took my shoe off with a hiss. Comparing it to my other foot, a bone appears to be sticking out a little at the top of my arch. I haven't the foggiest idea how to put it back in its correct place. No amount of massage, wiggling, or golf ball rolling has helped. It hurts enough when I first put weight on it that I end up hopping on the other foot. But if I hobble around for a bit the pain dies down. I guess there's more hobbling in my future. 
I've said it before and I'll say it again: my body is stupid.","

I had a pretty crappy night of sleep. It seemed like everything hurt. I woke a little late (but still in the dark) and moodily made coffee. I leaned up against a wooden post in the shelter while I drank my coffee in the dark. Today Achilles got up earlier so he was awake while I was there. He used the privy first, for which I was grateful. The metal seat was cold enough at the end of a warm day. I hadn't been looking forward to sitting on it after a night of chill. A warm toilet seat could be considered a little creepy sometimes, but given the icy option it made me happy. 
Sloping side hill trail helped my foot some. It forced me to walk in a funky position that seemed like it rearranged my foot a little. You can still see bone and probably some inflammation bulging out, but it doesn't hurt as much. I googled reducing a cuneiform bone without any helpful result. 
Thick morning fog gave way to blue skies and fluffy white clouds. The hiking was approximately 1,000 small hills in sequence. It was a tiring day. I never really get in a groove on this kind of sawtooth day. It helped that I had motivation- French fries. A new restaurant has opened right at the trailhead outside Bland. Passing hikers told me they had French fries there today, and also that it was an easy hitch into town. Unfortunately the place closes early on Saturday, so no fries for me. Also barely any cars passed in my direction. 
I tried calling a hostel listed in AWOL. No answer. I left a message, waited, then gave up on them. I called the motel and asked about a ride there. They said to call Bubba. Bubba the shuttler was on time. $10 for 4 miles is cheaper than a cab I guess. I'll probably call him in the morning to get back there. 
The lady at the front desk said she'd do my laundry for $10. That seemed excessive. Before addressing cleanliness issues I went to the DQ/gas station/convenience store across the street for dinner. I've eaten there at least three times and it's been mediocre every time. I didn't finish my meal. I found enough food to get me to Atkins at the convenience store so I didn't have to walk to the farther away Dollar General. I didn't find any drink mix though. I'm going to be hurting for electrolytes by Atkins. 
Upon returning to the motel I decided to wash my clothes in the sink. I'm pruney but there is an excellent chance I'll smell better tomorrow.","

To my surprise, my foot and rib felt better this morning. Cheap motel beds usually aren't helpful like that. Day two of my migraine was thudding behind my left eyebrow though. It seemed like it was going to be pretty bad, so I decided to take medicine for it. I knew that this would make my legs feel tired, but I figured tired legs would be better than a raging headache. 
When I checked my clothes, they had barely dried at all. I switched the cooling unit over to heat and draped clothes across the vent. My socks dried fairly quickly that way, but my pants still had a way to go when I gave up and put them on. At least by then they were warm and damp, not cold and damp. They're damp most days from sweat anyway. 
I checked the weather. It's supposed to rain tonight for a few hours. I need to test out my tent some time, but for today I decided to stop a little early and stay at Jenkins shelter. The tired legs probably would champion this idea if they could talk. 
I called Bubba at 7:45 and we were soon on our way back to the trailhead. I don't know how I missed it yesterday, but there was a Hello Kitty cover on his steering wheel. I asked about it and soon he was telling me about his wife and their pot bellied pigs. When we got there he showed me video of his wife petting one of the pigs on his belly. At the end of the song that was playing, the pig fell over, stiff legged. I said he reminded me of one of those fainting goats. Bubba said he wanted to get one of those and name it Boo. This cracked me up, starting my hike with a laugh. 
Mid morning I ran into an English dayhiker. He's on a work trip and took time to come out and see the trail. He was fun to talk to and he kept me company until lunchtime. After lunch he sped up so he could get as far as Jenkins Creek and have time to return to Bland before dark. I never saw him again, which worried me. I got to the shelter and shortly after Ghost Hiker walked in. She saw him a mile north of the shelter, headed back. I'm pretty sure I didn't get off the trail at any point, so he must have. He had some problems following the blazes on the way out. There are so many unmarked trails in the area that it's easy to be mislead. I hope he made it back to his car all right. 
Ghost Hiker made a meal and then moved on. I decided to stay but it feels odd to be here so early - it was around three when I got here. And the weather looks perfect, too. I'll be surprised if it actually does rain tonight. By the time I found a good bear branch and then made dinner, it was 4:30. I prefer to stop hiking around 5 anyway, with dark coming earlier now. So I guess I'll twiddle my thumbs until bedtime. 
I'm a little sad to find that the privy here has been replaced. In 2010 it was a stool on a wooden box, with no walls to protect one's dignity. The current privy still isn't very substantial, but it does have walls and a roof. The old one was so hilarious that it was worth the embarrassment.","

Mudflap arrived in the evening. We decided to make a fire to combat mosquitoes. I leapt into action, finding dry downed wood like a mountain woman. I built a fire of which I was very proud. I'm not sure if it got rid of the mosquitoes or if the temperature just dropped enough, but either way things were better. 
I slept snug as a bug in a rug. Mudflap was chilly in his bag, I found out in the morning. We both woke at six and ate breakfast still in our sleeping bags. He passed me going up the mountain after we left the shelter. I didn't see another hiker all day, which was just as well because when I got up to the ridge line and checked messages, my heart broke. 
JD let me know that he'd made Andrew's final appointment for today. Everything had gotten worse at once and it was time to release him from his suffering. I regretted not being there for both of them. As I walked on, waves of grief started to roll over me. I would have to stop walking while I sobbed, unable to see. I asked JD to play ""I love you, but goodbye"" for Andy as I couldn't be there. 
Andy has been getting worse for a while, suffering from cancer and side effects of chemo. It's a delicate balance, caring for an animal. You love them so you want to keep them alive, but you also want them to be well and happy. I can't regret ending his life. JD and I both wish there were some way to make him well again, but there isn't. 
Vale, Andrew, fluffiest of pants, patient hunter of mice, opener of drawers, destroyer of bags, cat of my heart. You were my once in a lifetime cat. I don't know what I did to deserve your devotion, but I returned it and you knew it. 
After his passing I sat in Chestnut Knob Shelter, wrung out. I never liked that shelter and my grief did not improve it. I sat there, freezing, listening to the wind whistle. I wasn't with Andrew at the end because of this thruhike. Well, by gum, I would hike then. I put my pack back on and charged out of there. 
Out in the sun I felt a little better, although I was still cold and sad. I didn't want to think anymore. I put on podcasts and some layers and I just walked. 
Tonight it will be cold. The campsite I found is likely to be damp but I expect I'll be all right.  Time and things to do will help me get over this loss. Seeing JD next week will help too.","

Gosh it was chilly last night. I was glad I had my down booties. I dug them out of my clothes bag around midnight when my feet felt cold. In the morning I put on my down jacket and down miniskirt to wear in camp. I fetched my food bag from across the river where I hung it last night, and then I got back in my sleeping bag until I finished breakfast. I was sad when it was time to pack the sleeping bag. 
I got moving well before dawn. In the dim twilight my headlamp didn't seem to help much. Within fifteen minutes there was enough light to see without it. It was quite cold down in the hollows. I hiked wearing my fleece top, windbreaker, buff, and gloves. I gradually removed layers, but some I kept handy to put back on when I went down into a hollow or just downhill so I was generating less heat. I kept my double bagged water filter inside my windbreaker until mid morning. I wasn't sure what the temperature was. Probably not freezing but there was no sense in risking the integrity of the filter. Hence its kangaroo pouch location. 
I had intended to tent tonight but as the day went on it seemed like I could reasonably make it Atkins. Tenting would mean a three mile trip to Atkins, then a long boring day in a motel room. Or skipping the motel, as well as the shower, electronics recharge, etc. Instead I made it to town at 7, in good time to get food at the Mexican place (pretty great food), get a room, and purchase a few days of food. The food is from a gas station. After this trip I think I might swear off gas station food for a while. 
The motel room is hilariously bad. At $45 I don't expect much, but even so it's humorous to me how many things are wrong with it. The Relax Inn hasn't changed much over the times I've stayed here. Maintenance isn't their strong suit. Nor is cleanliness. At least the room doesn't smell like smoke. 
Tomorrow I'm looking forward to breakfast at The Barn, a short walk from here. Then a twelve mile walk to Partnership Shelter, from which I can order pizza if I'm so inclined. I'm tentatively scheduling myself for nineteen miles the day after. That's a very long day for me, but I need to meet a friend in the next few days and there are not so many options that work with regard to distances hiked and possible road crossings.","

With the help of my air mattress I slept pretty well. At six I woke and gradually got moving. It was hard without coffee. I needed to time things right so I got to the barn at 7. I mean The Barn. It's semi famous on the trail. It's almost directly on the trail and has good, fairly cheap food. It opens at 7. I left the motel in the dark at 6:50, walking up the hill toward the welcoming light of the restaurant. 
I prefer dual caffeination, so I ordered Pepsi as well as coffee. I've noticed that everyone seems to carry Pepsi rather than Coke here. Bunch of heathens. I can make do with it but it's not my preference. The waiter didn't bat an eye at my odd request. 
Within a short time I had eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast, and French toast. I ate it all with glee except for the piece of toast I managed to knock to the floor. The last bites I sort of had to pack in around the edges. Totally worth it. Atkins (or more properly Groseclose) really stepped up to the plate (heh) on this trip. Both Burrito Loco and The Barn rocked. 
Leaving The Barn in daylight I could see the frost building up. The temperature continued dropping until about 9 AM, thickly coating grass, windshields, and handrails. I ducked into my motel room to finish packing. I rounded everything up and stowed it, but I found reasons to delay leaving. It was warm inside and cold out there. Why would I leave that?
Eventually I left the room, warmly dressed. Trees were starting to drip but the grass was still thickly coated in white. My feet quickly grew wet, although not uncomfortably cold. I made mental notes to get my woolen and waterproof hiking socks from home. They weren't necessary today, but I think this morning was a preview of days to come. I'll want them later. 
Within an hour I was down to one layer. It was cold when I stopped but felt good otherwise. I stopped briefly at the Lindamood School and took some pictures, then continued uphill. At Chatfield Shelter I stopped for a snack. The register detailed a hunter holding a shotgun on a hiker at nearly point blank range in the last few days. I decided it was a good time to don my blaze orange vest. It's still a little warm to hike wearing it, but sweat is far preferable to near misses. Or actually being shot. 
I was surprised to see a ""privy closed"" sign at Chatfield. No explanation. I guess it's full? Or broken? I dunno. It didn't look like a good place to have to dig a hole - a narrow valley with minimal cover. I'm glad I had not arrived intending to stay. 
At Partnership I quickly rounded up two other hikers to order food, as there's a $15 minimum. Within half an hour I was happily scarfing pizza. I got some Sprite to drink with it. I got Pepsi to have with the leftovers in the morning. I'm definitely going to have to dump some soda before I leave. Totally worth it to be able to have soda with my dinner and my leftovers though. 
At 7:30 it seems like half the shelter is asleep, which is weird because nobody seemed to be a morning person. Maybe they were just too chilly to hang out outside their sleeping bags. I know I spend a lot of time in mine. 
It's weird how few people I see during the day, but I still see people at shelters. Not a lot, usually. The five people in tonight's shelter is the biggest crowd in some time, and I've spent plenty of nights alone. But it's still more than it feels like in the woods. 
This portion of the hike is very different from my more crowded northbound section. I had my share of solo nights there too. But the woods felt less empty. Years of solo hiking has accustomed me to my own company in the woods. I find it peaceful. In fact I get a little grumpy when there are too many people around. I like a person or two in camp, generally. But I'm surprisingly happy walking alone all day. Sometimes people are work. Especially with strangers, the timing of who talks when, understanding accents, failed attempts at humor, and all kinds of other awkwardnesses can make interactions stressful. That almost never happens when it's just me talking to myself.","

Boy, I sure slept snug as a bug in a rug. It seemed a lot warmer than predicted. I had to stick an arm out of the sleeping bag to cool off a few times. I wondered if my belly full of pizza did it or if it really were warmer. No answers were forthcoming. 
I managed to ignore my bladder until six in the morning. I got up to answer the call, but then I got back in my bag. I was ready to get up, but everyone else was asleep and I didn't want to wake them. I have no idea how they were still asleep - they were heading into eleven hours of sleep at that point. I watched the sky for half an hour. First the last, brightest stars, then the edge of dawn lightening the horizon. Eventually I figured I would start rustling when Chipmunk did. 
The two of us didn't speak but did start moving. I fetched my food bag and ate breakfast in bed - cold pizza and Pepsi. I wondered if I would feel cold from all the cold food, but I did not. It was a pretty great breakfast, although it felt a little weird to eat savory food. It was definitely more filling than my typical honeybun and coffee. 
Wally and Treats stayed in their bags a while longer. In fact Treats was still in his bag when I left, and he had been the first in his bag last night. Clearly the boy likes his rest. 
Powered by cola, I rambled quickly through the morning. I warmed up on the first mountain, stripping down to one layer as I sweated. At the top I checked for cell signal and was able to access the internet. I was surprised to find that the temperature was apparently 45. Maybe I'm acclimating to cooler weather. Certainly I have been hiking with just my shirt and my thin windbreaker in the mornings when it's barely 40. I layer up quickly when I stop moving. I need to get a stuff sack for my down jacket so I can safely keep it near the top of my pack. Right now I'm wearing it while packing up and stashing it in a ziplock right before I close up my pack. 
Shortly after descending the mountain I was surprised to find that it was lunchtime. I found a nice rock to sit on. Another slice of pizza and more Pepsi was most of my lunch. I had packed out a Rice Krispie treat too. It's not homemade, but I haven't had any but store bought in long enough that it tasted all right to me. 
In the afternoon I walked through the meadow that used to contain a bus. It's less junky now but also less interesting. Soon thereafter I was at Trimpi shelter, my destination for tonight. It's a very short day but it leaves me well situated to meet Shannon at a road crossing tomorrow. And then three days after that I should find JD in Damascus! Spouse JD, not hiker JD, although hiker JD is catching up.  I could see him too. 
With lots of time in camp, I set up my tent to dry out. It had occurred to me that it was probably still damp from my riverside night. It sure was damp, too. I left it empty to dry while I hung my bear line. It took me many tries and two trees to finally get it over a good branch. One throw managed to get the entire rope somehow up in the tree and tangled up. That took a while and a long stick to undo. Another throw managed to catch the tail end of the rope in thorns. The rope and I were both somewhat worse for wear after that, although at least the rope wasn't bleeding. 
Getting water (spring status = slowly running) I was delighted to find a crawdad in the pool. He looked furious at me for cleaning leaves out of there. Had I realized he was using them, I would have left them alone. He glared at me for a while, then slunk under one of the remaining leaves to sulk. 
The privy looks new and quite nice, although not extremely private with its half height walls. It was out of duff so I grabbed the bucket and rake and went out to get more. I didn't do a fantastic job. The duff here is very thin. It's hard to get any without newer leaves in it. I did the best I could. 
I noted positive graffiti in the privy. I don't think it's okay to write on structures, but I guess ""Thanks for the nice privy"" is a best case scenario for graffiti. Less positive but evoking sympathy was ""I don't need trail legs. I need a trail rectum. ""","

Sleep, glorious sleep. I was so cozy in my tent. At 5:30 I saw that Hangry and Tantrum's tent was glowing. I considered getting up. Then I rolled over and went back to sleep. At a little after 6:30 I woke up again and bowed to the inevitable and also my bladder. I visited the privy and then the tree with my food bag. 
I made coffee and then ate breakfast while watching the sky change colors. Hangry and Tantrum left while I was still sipping coffee. Shortly thereafter I packed up and got gone. The sun was just barely up over the ridge line, lighting the tops of the trees. 
The miles passed peacefully. Here in southern Virginia, no incline is so steep as to catch a thruhiker's attention. I go up, I go down, but never so significantly as to seriously disrupt my mellow. Nearly 1700 miles of hiking have given me a certain amount of ability to walk. Amazingly, another hiker stepped aside for me to pass him today. I certainly seemed to be faster than him. I stopped at the road to wait for my friend, and the fellow didn't arrive there for a good long while. Possibly he was 80, but I'll take my victories where I can. 
In 2010, I was going to visit Shannon near Damascus. But cell signal was severely lacking, and I couldn't contact her until well after I passed. This year I had a better phone and better cell service. I contacted her several days ago to arrange a time and place. Only 7 years later, I finally stayed with her during a thruhike. 
She met me at Fox Gap, then drove me to a grocery. After a whirlwind tour of the store (during which I noted that Shannon knew or was related to the whole town), we returned to her house where I met her family, showered, started laundry, and ate the amazingly yummy dinner that her husband cooked. Notice that showering came nearly immediately after entering the house. 
I liked the whole family. I'm sad that I don't live close enough to get to know the kids as they grow up. I think they're both going to be amazing. I'm trying to remember how and when I first knew Shannon, and drawing a blank. Nevertheless we stayed up hours past hiker midnight, talking. 
Also I need to steal their adorable dog, Cole. Sweetest dog ever. Possibly that would be a bad repayment of their hosting generosity. 
Son Preston relinquished his room for the night, so I get to sleep on a real bed. I would have been happy with the sofa, but perhaps Preston likes the opportunity to watch movies late? I'm grateful at any rate. Eating a real dinner (with multiple vegetables!), taking a hot shower and drying off with a real towel, sleeping in a real bed - these are all huge luxuries in my current life. My days are long on nature and peace. Not so much the modern conveniences. I am so, so appreciative and thankful that Shannon opened her home to me. It means a lot. Thank you, Shannon.","

Today was my fourth transit of the Grayson Highlands and for sure my prettiest trip. The weather was fall perfect - blue skies, about 70 degrees, a light breeze. A lot of leaves have fallen but there is still plenty of color. 
However much of Virginia and North Carolina seemed to be on the trail with me. Today was the most people I've ever seen on the trail, and most of them had dogs. I literally saw hundreds of people today, and stepped off the trail dozens of times for people to pass. All of the dogs and people were nice, but it felt crowded like a theme park. 
I saw probably a hundred people camped in the mile or two prior to Thomas Knob shelter, and people told me it was very crowded here. I kept walking because I needed water. When I got to the shelter there was plenty of room left. I guess the system worked out like it's supposed to - the shelter being mostly used by thruhikers. 
A shelter companion offered me Evan Williams bourbon, which turned out to be quite tasty. Another offered me a couple of marshmallows to toast over the fire we collectively started in the fire pit. I roasted one of them for her using Grampa May's patented marshmallow browning method. Thanks for the mad marshmallow roasting skills, Grampa. They've definitely come in handy over the years. 
As the sun was going down, other hikers clued me in to the amazing sunset going on. I climbed up on the rocks behind the shelter and beheld one of my top ten all time sunsets. It was so beautiful that my heart hurt. I watched until the sky started to darken, then clambered back down to the shelter. I dug out my headlamp only to find it nearly dead. This headlamp seems to die very suddenly. I'm still carrying the spare I got from Fresh Ground, so I got it out to find my spare batteries and replace them. I'm starting to think maybe I should just keep carrying it.","

This is how I came to ponder the Jacobite Rebellion this morning. 
When I left the shelter, the trail was in shadow. When I stepped out into sunshine, I looked back and saw the sun slanting sideways into the mountains to the west. It was during one of those brief moments when the sun hits just right and makes everything look very clear. Every peak was highlighted against the shadow behind it. It was so beautiful that I felt the crevices in my soul filling in, like that sunlight was the last half slice of pie you eat at Thanksgiving, when you have just a little more space around the edges. Thus I started my morning topped up with joy and also coffee. 
Thinking of the sun, I pondered how it is the source of all life and more importantly all energy on Earth. We eat plants that grow using energy converted from sunlight. We burn wood which also converts energy from sunlight. And we convert that sunlight to radiant heat in fires. We also burn coal and oil. Both are the end results of many growing things dying and then undergoing millennia of aging, compression, and whatever else is happening under the ground. We burn the past when we burn oil and coal. I wonder in the future if archaeologists might be able to glean information from coal like they do from fossilized bones. And other things that fossilize, like poop. Poop fossilizes into coprolites, from which you can apparently glean information. I wonder how many of the hundreds of thousands of deuces dropped along the Appalachian Trail might fossilize? I know it's rare. Maybe two? And then will anybody ever find those two pooprocks and do a chemical analysis to find out that we survived on a food that they will have no way of knowing is called Snickers?
Coprolite rhymes with Jacobite. I recently listened to the audiobook of Outlander as I walked. The heroine frequently goes on about ""bloody Jacobites!"" I infer that this was a rebellion to put a Scottish noble on the throne of an independent Scotland, although I might have gotten it wrong. But who then was Jacob? I'm not sure there was a Jacob in the story. I need google in the worst way. 
My brain works in mysterious ways. 
My day passed peacefully. Whitetop Mountain continues to be beautiful. I reflected on the company I've had while walking through here before. I had to speak sternly to Bessie the cow. She was blocking the trail coming down from Whitetop. Seven O'clock kept leapfrogging with me. He hiked faster than me and takes lots of breaks. He kept surprising me by coming up from behind me. He likes to get off trail and be unseen for his breaks. I generally sit on a rock beside the trail, myself. 
I was eating Jelly Bellies when I felt my crown come loose. This crown and I have a history, so although it was extremely annoying, it wasn't completely unexpected. At least I didn't swallow it this time. I cleaned Jelly Belly goo off of it and the stump as well as I could, then put the crown back in my mouth. When I got to camp I dug out the tube of Fixodent that I carry for just such an occasion. Fixodent is far from permanent so I'll need to reapply frequently until I can get my hands on some dental cement. But I was able to secure the crown in my mouth for now.","

I've been thinking about hypermobility. Usually I consider it in the context of yoga, but it affects many areas of my life, including hiking. The first analogy I thought of was my body as a car. Most people's bodies respond more like a sports car. There is very little play in the steering, and the tires don't slip. If you ask for a sharp turn to the left, you get a sharp turn to the left. Generally speaking you know that if you ask your body to do something within its athletic capabilities, you'll get a response pretty close to what you expect. My body handles more like an old van. There's a lot of play in the steering, it wallows on uneven ground, and there can be unexpected motion. 
If you consider my body to be a marionette, the joints were put together with rubber bands that aren't quite tight enough. If my puppeteer sets me down slowly and carefully, my legs will likely come down straight. But add a little bounce, or an uneven surface, and my joints can go in an unexpected direction. My marionette ends up with legs all akilter. 
Your ligaments are key to your sense of proprioception - your sense of where your body is in space. If your ligaments don't respond quite normally, you never really know exactly where all your body parts. Your hands are easier to keep track of if you can see them, and your brain will happily use that information for proprioception. But if you aren't looking at them, that doesn't help. Imprecise proprioception leads to problems interacting with the environment. Slamming into doorframes, tripping on rocks, stubbing toes, whacking your hands against shelves - all are due to errors in proprioception. 
This is manageable, to an extent. Carefully watching my footing helps me place my feet better. Uneven surfaces, even if I know they're there, can result in my knees, ankles, or foot joints suddenly giving way without warning. This seldom happens in both legs at once, so I try to make sure my weight is solidly supported on one leg while I'm finding out if the other leg will support me. I rely heavily on my poles to help me recover from tripping or rolling an ankle. As much as possible, I maintain three points of contact with the ground. 
I always wondered why my friends found rock hopping to be fun and easy, while I found it to be treacherously dangerous. It was only much, much later that I realized it was normal to jump and be sure that your joints would support you when you landed. 
My methods of coping with hypermobility allow me to do the things I love, but they don't allow me to do them quickly. If it's possible to pay that much attention to your steps while moving quickly over uneven ground, I've certainly never achieved it. 
My ponderings won't help me go faster, but I'm glad I spent the time to examine the issue. It makes me feel a bit better about my pace. I think that I might be able to adapt some of my methods for handling joint instability on the trail to other areas of my life. I'll have to give it some thought.","

My foot, which has been hurting on and off, started hurting quite a lot while I was walking into town last night. I went to Mojo's and waited inside for JD. Well, I mean I ate a big sandwich and drank a bunch of coffee while eagerly awaiting my beloved. After he arrived he whisked me away to this B&b, which is quite fancy. 
While we chatted, I winced as my foot throbbed. After I peeled off my socks, I saw that it was swollen and a little discolored. We decided to get it looked at in the morning if it still felt bad. Meanwhile I experienced the joys of town food and cotton clothing. 
This morning, my foot started feeling a little higher on the agony scale as soon as I was conscious enough to notice it. Well, dang. It's not supposed to get worse overnight. We went down to breakfast and asked about local medical places. They directed us to a conveniently located urgent care place, and even called to ask about wait times for us. Turns out there's no wait first thing on a Tuesday morning. 
They checked me in, got me a doctor, x-rayed my foot, had a radiologist evaluate it, and returned me to the doc in less time than I usually wait to get into a room at my regular doctor's office. The doc went through the imaging with me. It didn't show a fracture, but they're hard to see on X-ray. MRI is fairly definitive, but they don't have one of those. He thought it very likely that I have a stress fracture. 
My options are to go home and wait about a month for it to heal, or keep walking. It will keep hurting and it won't really heal until I go home, but I can walk on it. He said it won't kill me, and he knew I wanted to continue my journey. I asked for advice on supportive measures such as taping. He showed me how to tape it and sent me on my way. 
I talked to JD about it. He suggested that I plan as if I'm still hiking, so I'll be prepared if I do. We went to Walmart to get my resupply and some sports tape. Back in the car I did a fairly haphazard job trying to imitate what the doctor showed me with tape. It doesn't look pretty, and it used most of a roll, but it does seem to help support my foot so it hurts less. 
We stopped by Mt Rogers outfitters in Damascus where they improvised a fix for my slightly broken hiking pole. I think I'm good to go for a while. I'll just have to wait and see on the foot. The doctor did warn that a bad step could make the bone break all the way through, and that really would be the end of my hike.  I'm giving up any hope of a twenty mile day. I think ten mile days are going to be more my speed - although they aren't always an option based on terrain and camping opportunities. I'm lightening my pack as much as I'm able, per the doctor. Wish me luck that my bones stay intact and I get to keep moving along the trail.","

After another good night's sleep, and good breakfast, I was ready to go. I kissed my beloved a tender goodbye and headed up the mountain out of town. I didn't go to the other end of town to do the roadwalk first. With a pissy foot and the future of my hike in some jeopardy, I decided that I'll be skipping any roadwalking that it is convenient to skip. Roads damage my feet more than nearly anything else, and they aren't terribly scenic either. 
I stepped carefully going up the hill. My foot actually felt pretty good after a day of being taped, with lots of food and rest. I wish it would stay that way, but I know it won't. Nonetheless I was happy with my first few miles. I walked slowly and carefully, choosing my foot placement with an eye to stability. I hope that this becomes automatic over time. 
It was quite cold. I was on a ridge line in the wind most of the day. I couldn't tell exactly how cold it was. Cold enough to hike wearing my fleece, buff pulled up over my ears, hands sheltered under my pole covers. I eventually put on my rain skirt to keep my legs warm. I pulled my water filter out and stowed it in my fanny pack near my body heat. 
Highlife walked up from behind me. He commented that it was quite an outfit, but it looked warm. I guess he was right. Between my rainbow gaiters, plastic looking rain skirt, and blaze orange cap and buff, I must have been an arresting sight. Later as it started to sleet I put my brilliantly blaze orange pack cover on. I was warm enough. Not toasty, but warm enough. 
I rolled up to the shelter at 4. Two section hikers were down getting water. I looked for the privy before realizing that there wasn't one. Dammit! At least there's a shovel leaning against the shelter. But it's bad enough using a privy in cold weather. Being completely exposed to the wind makes me pucker just thinking about it. I'd forgotten that Tennessee isn't a big believer in privies. 
The walk down to the water here is the longest .2 I've walked. My foot started to ache as I slowly filled my water bag at the trickle flowing from the pipe. On the way back up it was quite painful, so that I was limping badly as I made dinner. 
I tried to throw up a bear line and managed to get my rock bag firmly lodged in a tree. It took all three of us to get it back down.  Luckily it was a small enough tree that we could bend it down. I gave up and hung my bag in the shelter. Then I read the shelter register and noticed regular bear sightings. I grumped and got up to try again with the rope, but one of the guys kindly said I could put my bag on his line. It was work getting both bags up there, but I did it. I'll sleep better not worrying about the bag. Although it's supposed to rain, and my bear bag is not particularly waterproof anymore. It's a hassle to deal with when it gets wet inside. 
I'm cautiously optimistic about my foot, but I'm not so sure about the cold. You can get used to many things. Maybe I'll acclimate. I managed to work outdoors in Minnesota in winter fairly happily, but I had the heated tack room to retreat to occasionally. Cold nights are nothing new, but it's harder when you never warm up during the day. 
I can take advantage of quite a few hostels for warm sleeping and slackpacking, and I think I will. At least if it stays chilly. We've had a ludicrously warm fall, and I think I got spoiled. Now is the time to test the mettle of the southbound hiker. 
I've done some winter camping. Time to remember those skills. I know I'm trying to minimize pack weight but I may pick up a Nalgene to make a hot water bottle with. It feels great, plus it's nice to have liquid water handy in the morning. Tonight I'm hoping it doesn't get cold enough to freeze my various containers solid. I neglected to get larger ziplocks and I don't much want to bring either my Sawyer bag or my hydration bag in with me without a better guarantee against wetness. 
It's been precipitating on and off since late afternoon. The guys are in a tent and a hammock. Not me, thanks. It may be colder in a shelter than a tent, but I've packed up a frozen tent before. If I never have to do that again, it'll be too soon. 
I made a hot drink to go with dinner - kiwi strawberry Propel. It was frankly delicious. I'm pretty sure that's a habit that I'll keep up.","

It felt bitterly cold last night. My sleeping bag is rated for 20 degrees but my body sure didn't believe it. My feet were cold all night. They didn't warm up in the morning until I'd been hiking for an hour in wool socks. My sleeping pad felt cold, although it claims to be insulated. When I woke up to water a tree during the night, I moved the thin foam pad I normally put on the floor to the top of the pad. That helped reduce the heat flowing out by a lot. 
At 6:30 I checked my watch and decided it was time to get up. I'm sure I slept more than it felt like. It seemed like I didn't sleep at all before I got up and moved my foam pad, but it definitely didn't feel like 5 hours either. It must have been one of those nights where I drift in and out of sleep without realizing it. 
Given how cold I felt, I was concerned about Todd in his 45 degree bag. He survived but said it was miserable. They made arrangements to have a relative bring a 15 degree bag to the trail for him today. 
It stayed chilly all morning. I took off my fleece top when it got up to 35. I never felt the urge to take my windbreaker off. I kept my buff on too. I finally removed my pole grip warmers around 2 pm. I think the high was 51, reached right around when I stopped hiking for the day. 
I like that there are so many camping options in the south. Most aren't listed in my guide, but if I walk for a while I'll generally find an established tentsite. I could always put my tent up on any given flat spot, but I prefer to camp somewhere clearly well used. It reduces my impact and also generally makes for a more pleasant campsite. 
Tomorrow should be beautiful, but the current forecast calls for hypothermia weather on Saturday. I am going to try to call Boots Off Hostel to see if they can pick me up somewhere on Friday night or Saturday morning. A day of cold wet weather sounds like a fantastic day to be indoors. 
As always happens when I've recently seen my husband, I find myself wondering why I'm out here freezing my parts off in my sleeping bag when I could be at home in bed with my spouse and our dogs. Our heated bed. In our nice warm house. What drives me to keep going? I am as mystified as ever. I don't know what wakes me up an hour before dawn to start my hiking day. I don't know what pushes me to get up and walk when I've only just sat down. I'm not this motivated about my daily life at home. I can't explain it. All I can do is keep walking for as long as my body lets me, and hope that seeing the plaque on Springer Mountain will satisfy whatever it is that drives me.","

I was stunned to see daylight when I woke up. I've been waking up in the dark for ages. I was cold again last night and moved the foam pad under me around 4 or 5. I guess I slept better afterward. Hence the late awakening. I lay there for a few minutes, staring out of my tent. I was feeling pretty glum. Today was the first day I had thoughts of quitting. Not that I'm quitting, yet. But this was the first time I ever had thoughts of it. I think the combination of cold sleeping (which is awful) and foot pain are sapping my will. 
I have short and long term plans to deal with the cold. Short term I need a Zrest or other foam pad to supplement my air pad. Sliding downhill reminded me that I still need my thin pad under me to keep me from sliding. Long term, I'm hoping my NeoAir Xtherm is still good. JD is going to test it for me to see if it's leaking. 
The weather today was as beautiful as predicted, which helped my mood a lot. I didn't feel like quitting as I looked out at the leaves glowing in the sunlight. 
I called Boots Off Hostel and hoped to go there tonight to avoid the foul weather this weekend, but my foot said I was done when I got to Vandeventer Shelter at 4. I was willing to pay money to have somebody else get water, but when I got there a section hiker was feeling worse than me. Instead I offered to get water for him. It was .3 miles down a steep side trail. I slipped and almost fell, twice. Luckily the water was flowing well. I dipped out 4-5 liters and then staggered back up the hill with many rest breaks. 
The hiker offered me a ride to the outfitter if I get to the road at the same time as him. I guess my good deed paid off, not that I was looking for a reward. I'll totally take him up on it if the timing works out. 
Two other hikers are also here. It's nice to have all the company. 
I got my bear line up in the tree on the first try tonight, btw. Of course there was nobody looking. Dammit.","

I pulled a damnfool move last night. I was having my nightly sip of scotch when a dayhiker stopped by the shelter. I didn't think about what I was doing and kept sipping while we talked. When he left I got up and realized that I had sipped WAY more than I should have. A little later I had to migrate away from the shelter to puke, and I had to sit up in my sleeping bag afterward until the world stopped spinning. I like to drink but I don't like to drink to excess. It's miserable. I'm a little stunned that I got schnockered in such a short time and on the amount of liquor that I did. I was so mad about it that I threw out the rest of the scotch I had. 
I woke up feeling hungover this morning, of course. All pale and shaky. I had coffee and a honeybun and was all right, but I wished I had been able to retain dinner the night before. Today for the first time in years I got feeling hypoglycemic, and I'm certain it's related. 
The four of us at the shelter walked down to Wilbur Dam parking area together. They seemed content to have me in front, which was fine by me. My foot made me slow, but my thruhiker stamina meant I didn't need to stop. It worked out that we would bunch up on downhills and spread out on uphills. I had the unaccustomed luxury of talking to another person while hiking. Dana, Judy, and Alan were a fun bunch. 
I got a ride with Dana and his son. They dropped me off at the hostel. The bunkhouse had all the lower bunks taken, so I opted for a tiny house - effectively a half size bunkhouse. After showering I went up the hill to dump my trash and found hiker JD! His group was the one in the bunkhouse. It sure was good to see him again. I would love to join his current tramily but they're doing big days of slackpacking. Even without a pack I don't see my foot handling a 20 mile day. 
I spent the afternoon being chilly in the tiny house and realized that tomorrow would be miserable with no heat - it's expected to snow all day. I went up to the bunkhouse to try to climb into an upper bunk. I discovered that even if my foot didn't hurt, I still wouldn't be agile enough to climb up there. Fearless and I were discussing the possibility of me sleeping on the table when JD climbed up into a top bunk and offered me his bottom bunk. He is such a gentleman! I took him up on the offer with much gratitude. I grabbed my things from the tiny house and moved up the hill. The heat feels amazing. 
A nero today and zero tomorrow throw me off schedule, and at the moment I can't just walk longer days to make it up. I'm starting to consider that this thruhike may have to be turned into a long ass section hike. Cold weather is already coming, and I'm not prepared for serious winter hiking. Mindy said Clingman's Dome was supposed to be at 15 degrees and get 7 inches of snow tomorrow. Likely it will melt well before I get there, but clearly it is not too early to encounter winter in the Smokies. 
I'm not sure how far I'll hike. Injury may not be what takes me off the trail. If the weather gets bad enough to send me home before Springer, I won't be heartbroken. I've hiked a long time and a long distance. I've made friends. I've had adventures. I miss my home and my family. It's getting to be time to be with the ones I love.","

It got cold during the night. JD had mentioned it was warm in the top bunk so I figured he turned off the heater. I put on my fleece top, draped my down jacket over my blanket, and shivered. Eventually I decided to get up and go to the bathroom and found that my bunk's light wouldn't turn on. Huh. Maybe the power to the bunkhouse was out?
I grabbed my headlamp and headed to the bathroom, where the heater and light didn't work. On the way back I observed that none of the structures had light. Okay, definitely the whole complex then. I stopped in at the hostel kitchen and found JD and Fearless. As I talked to them and then to Sierra and Sleepy Bear, it turned out that all four of us initially assumed that JD turned off the heat. Pretty funny. 
Jim, the owner, kept calling the power company and eventually they restored power. Prior to that I made coffee on my campstove. But I was also happy to drink more coffee later. Then somebody tripped the breaker for the kitchen. Since it wasn't my problem to solve, it was entertaining. 
I never intended to hike today, so I got back in my bunk and cuddled under my sleeping bag. The others had intended a 20 mile hike. The power outage introduced a delay, which sucks on a long day. Then they observed the deterioration of the weather - snow, sleet, and bitterly cold wind. They reluctantly decided to take the day off too. We all holed up in the bunkhouse with a valiant little heater that took the edge off the cold but didn't make the place warm. 
Jim brought books and games. We all mostly stayed in our bunks, reading, napping, and otherwise entertaining ourselves. Our big adventure for the day was driving in to Hampton to get dinner at Subway. It's been the laziest day since.. gosh. I don't know. A long, long time. Years maybe. It's kind of nice except for the cold. The other four hikers are good, undemanding company. I think today is a win. 
Tomorrow I'll get shuttled back to Wilbur Dam and hike past the hostel and on to Kincora, then get shuttled back here for one more night. It's a bit of an expensive way to do it, as I'll have to get shuttled back to Dennis Cove Rd the following day. But I'll sleep indoors one more night when it's still a little cold out, and slackpacking will be easier on my foot. I tell myself it's still cheaper than staying in a motel, and the company is far better.","

I was worried about waking up in time. Sierra had said she would poke me when she got up. But I kept waking up and checking my watch. I woke up at six and turned on my light inside my bunk, being the first to wake up. Imitating Fearless, I wore most of my daytime clothes to sleep for a faster start. I had to wrestle my bra on under my clothes, but I was up and about quickly. I stepped outside the nice warm bunkhouse to visit the bathroom and once again wished the bathroom was attached to the bunkhouse. It was about 28 degrees and there was snow on the ground, but it felt warmer than it did yesterday with wind and sleet. 
My feet were icy last night. I'm coming to realize that my sleeping bag is fine. My feet's problems will not be resolved with more insulation. I'll have to add heat to the situation with hand warmers or a hot water bottle. 
After a breakfast eaten while sitting in front of a heater, we all bundled into the Hiker Hauler - Jim's Suburban. As we drove up to higher elevation, the road turned icy and I couldn't watch. Fearless, sitting next to me, was highly amused when I covered my eyes. She was less amused when we stopped and they had to get out into the snow. They looked miserable setting out into the snow. 
Jim and Seiko and I drove on to Wilbur Dam where they let me out. The hike was quite pleasant until I got to Pond Mountain. I mean, it was still nice walking, but it started getting snowy. Snow led to wet, cold feet. I wished that I had brought my waterproof socks. I didn't take any breaks, wanting to get to lower elevation. When the temperature rose, ice water starting dropping out of trees and I bundled into my rain jacket, skirt, and pole covers. Laurel Creek was really roaring with the recent rains. 
When I got to Dennis Cove Rd, I was surprised to see Seiko. He said he was waiting for a hiker. I said it was nice to see him and turned to head up to Kincora. Then he let me know that I was the hiker he was waiting for. Heh! I was so surprised!  After a miscommunication he turned around and took me to Kincora to get my package from Goddess, then drove us back to Boots Off. 
Tommy, Fearless' husband, was waiting for her across from Shook Branch Park when we pulled up, so we said hi. Then Seiko dropped me off and I went in to open my package. It was full of wonders, including a Halloween headband to wear tomorrow, many many snacks, a card, and Caramel Kiss Vodka. I was blown away - and absolutely needed no additional food!
I texted Goddess to thank her, then caught up with everybody else to go out to dinner. We went to El Charolais in Elizabethton for some fairly spectacular Mexican food. We almost all got Margaritas. I got Huaracha and a chorizo taco, which were stunning, as well as a less exciting tostada. 
JD was sitting next to me and suddenly started feeling poorly. He put his head down near his knees and started sweating heavily. He said he needed to lie down and put his feet up, but he couldn't do it there. I organized Sleepy Bear and Tommy to haul him out to the car while I paid our bill. I left to sit with him while everyone else paid. He felt better as soon as he lay down, which was a relief. 
On the way back we stopped so I could buy denatured alcohol. I put down my foil and stove at the bunkhouse to test it. I put just a little in the stove and lit it to make sure I had the right product. It made quite a flame without the pot on it. Within a few seconds four alarmed men were behind me, thinking the bunkhouse was on fire. I apologized for not alerting them first, but assured them it was under control and would burn out in seconds, which it did. Whoopsy! No harm done though, other than to Jim's nerves. 
I packed as much as I could, but the sleeping bag has to go low in the pack. Tomorrow Tommy will drop me off at Dennis Cove Rd and I'll be on my own again. I think in good weather I'd rather sleep in the woods anyway, but I'll sure miss everyone else.","

At 5:45 I woke up and checked my watch. I groaned internally. I was still tired and wanted to fall back asleep, but I had to get up so soon I knew that I would feel worse if I fell back asleep than if I just got up. Reluctantly I turned on the light in my bunk and got dressed for the day. Mine was the first light to come on, but the others soon followed me. 
I packed up my remaining gear, then staggered down to the kitchen. I knew it was too early for breakfast, but there was a light on and I hoped for coffee. Lots of coffee. Jim had the percolator going. It wasn't very strong yet but I poured myself a cup anyway. I sat by the heater and blearily stared at nothing. 
The others came in and probably said things. I ate a donut and got more coffee. 
Soon we were all ready to head out. Fearless and I to Dennis Cove Rd. Sleepy Bear, Sierra, and JD to a point 11 miles further out. It will be the last time I see Fearless for a while, if at all. I should cross paths with the others for a few days yet if they keep slackpacking. In fact I saw them shortly into the day, before I reached Moreland Gap shelter. 
I spent the morning trying to walk briskly enough to stay warm. My pack groaned, stuffed with Goddess' generosity. It will be a while before I need to buy any snacks. Gradually my legs remembered how to carry a backpack up mountains. By lunchtime I forgot about how heavy it felt in the morning. 
I remembered that in 2010 this section felt like a very long series of pointless ups and downs. Now it feels like a very gentle path, with lovely soft footing and mild inclines. Funny what a difference time and mileage can make. I remembered being here with DeLee 16 years ago, and with Cody, Stickwalker, Belle, and Mountain Man in 2010. Near here DeLee had given me a carrot cake power bar for my birthday. Fellow hikers had walked on coals and gender swapped their clothes. The other thruhikers and I had camped along a cascading stream. I had fought a migraine. I had felt down and texted JD and DeLee for moral support. Memories cascaded around me like the rushing streams I kept encountering. 
It warmed up a little in the afternoon but remained brisk. It was an invitation to keep moving. I started to tire, taking brief standing breaks more often. I decided to stop at a bench by a view to rest. It was a nice spot, but gnats showed up to torment me. I shouldered my pack and moved on, ready to find a campsite. 
I stopped at the next stream for two liters of water, then walked on with an alert eye on my surroundings. In under a mile I found a pleasant campsite a few dozen yards off the trail. Within a few minutes I pitched my little tent and strung up a bear line. With satisfaction I sat in the waning sun to eat and consider my day. 
It wasn't my longest day ever, but it wasn't bad. I was carrying a heavy pack in fairly cold weather, which is strenuous. My foot barely twinged after it warmed up. I'm very pleased with its progress. I still must walk slowly, as a faster pace hurts it. But either I don't have to be as careful with it, or I've made the process of careful step placement automatic. I'm honestly not sure which it is. 
Much as I enjoyed hiker company over the last few days, and look forward to it again, the prospect of a quiet evening in the woods is attractive too. It is soothing to be alone in the woods. Doing what I want, when I want, without having to coordinate with others carries its own taste of freedom. In the morning I'll make coffee in the dark while disturbing no one. Or I'll sleep past dawn and have a lazy breakfast in bed without bogging down another's schedule. Either way I'll enjoy it.","

Appropriately for Halloween, there was scary screaming in the woods last night. Whoever it was quit before I was ready to stop reading and go to sleep. I ended up having one of my best nights of sleep on the trail, all snugly and warm and comfortable. I woke up at 6:30 and made myself start moving, but I didn't move fast. It was 8 when I finally hit the trail. 
Last night I pulled the tape off my foot, along with some hair off my leg. Ouch! My skin was irritated around the edge of the skin, so I tried walking without tape today. I missed it at the end of the day, but was mostly okay before that. I tried to retape tonight but couldn't repeat my previous comfortable tape job. I ended up cutting it back off. Adhesive tape is a lot less forgiving when I mess up than an ace bandage is. Maybe I'll try KT tape instead. It's less supportive but also less likely to cut off my circulation. 
I was tense today because I was in Campbell territory. Their land was taken many decades ago to make the AT in this area. They're still mad. There have been many incidents over the years. Fish hooks strung across trails at eye height. Spikes planted in the ground. Paint poured into streams. It's wise not to linger. I tried to cross roads when nobody was around, but an old beater car appeared when I was mostly across Buck Hollow Rd. I was climbing the stone steps up to the trail by the time it reached me, but the driver veered across the road toward me anyway and shouted at me as he passed the steps. Charming. But no harm done, other than my increased heart rate. 
At 19E I turned and walked to Mountain Harbor Hostel. I was disappointed to find the food truck shut down, the breakfast not on offer, and the General store low on supplies. All I really wanted was a couple of honeybuns and candy bars. I found some breakfast pastries in a vending machine, and the store still has some candy bars. That left dinner tonight. 
I scrounged some odds and ends out of my food bag and was going to eat them, but section hikers arrived with a car. Eric and Jay kindly invited me with them to dinner. Yay! We adjourned to Highlander BBQ for hot tasty food. On the way back we stopped at Dollar General for a couple of items. This vastly improved my evening. I definitely don't recommend stopping here out of season, though. Unless all you wanted was the bed, shower, and laundry. Then you're fine. But if they won't sell you food and they won't drive you to town, it's problematic for most thruhikers. 
JD and co are at Doe River. I'm not sure what order they're doing the next section in, but I might get to cross paths with them a few times. It's nice to know they're out there even if I'm not spending time with them. I'll be happy to be camped out in the warmer weather we're supposed to have, but I sure will miss company.","

I had a pretty great day today. I slept well on my camouflage sheets at the hostel. When I awoke and went out to the common room, I found hot coffee which had apparently brewed on a timer. Looking around, I found clean coffee mugs on the shelf nearby. The mugs were enormous, which suited me just fine. I poured a generous cup and took it back to my little room to eat and pack up. 
I waited until it was dim morning to leave. I didn't want to walk on the shoulder of the highway in full dark. Once I could see things outside, I set off. My pack felt heavy with four days of food, despite starting with less water than usual. I knew there would be springs in the first miles, and I had a 2600 foot climb to start my day. Better to get water later rather than carry an extra two pounds up that hill. 
I had the massive luck to be the only person on Big Hump. You can see for miles in all directions, as it's an enormous bald. I saw a raven but no other birds, no mammals, no people. Just me and some caterpillars. It was indescribably wonderful to climb up there completely alone. I felt like I owned the mountain. The only sounds were my breathing and the wind in the grass. 
Crossing the next gap I started seeing hikers and had to give up my hold on solitude. Near the top of Little Hump I ran into Sierra, Sleepy Bear and JD. JD fed me macadamia, cranberry, and white chocolate cookies from the bakery they visited this morning. They clearly enjoyed their time at Doe Rest (I think it's called). If I had caught up with them yesterday before paying at Mountain Harbor I would have joined them. It all worked out though. And they say that tomorrow they're getting on the trail with packs. 
I'm camped still 3 miles north of Carver Gap where they'll start. If I'm lucky they'll be feeling the weight of their packs and I'll be able to catch up with them tomorrow. After a long period of slackpacking, it's definitely hard to carry a heavy pack again. 
JD mentioned a package of chicken salad that somebody had left at Overmountain Shelter. Sure enough, when I got there, there was a little Bumblebee box. No shelter log, sadly. I took the box and sat for a bit, gazing at the view. It was early afternoon. The shelter felt very empty and cold with no other hikers there. I picked up my pack and set off for Stan Murray shelter. 
At Stan Murray, only 1.9 miles away, it was much cozier in that it slept only six people, not dozens.  The shelter had a new floor, but it was filthy. I didn't think the broom would get it clean enough that I would want to sleep on it. I looked at the food trash people had left behind, the mud, and the fat chipmunks who were clearly waiting for a moment of inattention so they could steal food. The last shelter was too big. This one was too gross. I left, looking for something just right. 
Less than a mile later I found my home for the night. It's in a little gap, which means it will be somewhat windy. But it has semiflat spots and trees with good branches for hanging a bear  line. The site I eventually settled on is a little higher in the middle than at the ends, so I've padded the head end of the sleeping pad as best I could. I pointed the foot of the sleeping bag into the wind to try to preserve heat around the opening at my head. 
For dinner I ate my scavenged chicken salad on the adorable little pack of crackers that came with it. I also finished off today's snacks, courtesy of Goddess. Come to think of it, almost nothing that I ate today was food that I purchased. Weird. 
With the chilling wind, I was in my tent by 5:30. I think it's going to be an early night.","

When the moon came up, it was so bright that I thought it was a hiker's headlamp pointed at my tent. The moon was bright all night, providing an uncommon level of visibility. But at 6:30 when I got up, clouds had rolled in. It was so dark that I double checked the time on my watch. 
Just as I finished packing, it started to rain. I opened the pack back up to retrieve my raincoat, then put on the pack cover, my rain jacket, rain skirt, and pole covers. I figured once I lost some elevation the weather would get better, but that turned out to be mistaken optimism. 
Luckily I've seen Jane and Round balds on clear days before, because I sure didn't see them today. The pine grove on the south side of Round has grown a great deal since 2010. It's acquired that spooky cathedral feeling. I could have spent all day walking through woods like that. 
Hiking up Roan, I was surprised to be passed by Achilles, who is back from his trip. I don't expect to see him again, but you never know. I saw a few other hikers, but none that I knew. No sign of JD and company. I stopped in at Clyde Smith Shelter to check the register. I could have stayed, but I still find empty shelters creepy so I moved on to tent elsewhere. 
Nobody is at Greasy Creek Gap either. I figure anybody who might have stayed here probably went on down to the hostel half a mile away. I didn't want the extra walk. I'm fine in my tent. Except for the 1"" root bisecting the ground under the tent. Somehow neither my eyes nor my questing foot found it when I assessed the site, but my butt sure found it when I lay down. I can't face packing everything to move the tent, so I'll live with the root. Pretty sure I'll regret it in the morning. 
There's been a funky smell the last few miles, like a factory's smoke is trapped under the clouds. It has variously smelled like pot, burning plastics, burning rhododendron, a latrine, and mold. I sincerely hope to leave it behind tomorrow.","

Clouds rolled through during the night, soaking everything. It also actually rained, for variety. I was surprised to find that the root under my sleeping pad didn't significantly hinder my sleep. I scooched around to accommodate it whenever I changed position. 
In the dark I fetched my food bag and ate breakfast by headlamp. It was warm enough that I decided to forgo hot coffee and had it cold. I was grumpy about the weather. My forecast had included neither yesterday's wet weather nor today's, but it looked like the weather didn't care about that. 
I spent nearly all of the day walking in gloom. I could see valleys lit up down below, but the mountains stayed enshrouded. I wished those rays would burn up the clouds and reach me. Oddly, the light patches didn't appear to move or change. It looked like the weather system was completely stationary. 
At Cherry Gap Shelter I stopped for water and a snack. The piped spring was gushing, which is always nice. I almost got a good picture of the lizard hanging out on top of the pipe, but he was camera shy. Oh, and I saw a red eft today! I haven't seen one in a thousand miles. He was shy too, but moved slowly enough that he had his picture taken anyway. 
The top of Unaka Mountain was spooky in the fog. It always has a reverent hush thanks to the carpet of pine needles, but the mist added an eerie awesomeness. On my way down the south  side I came across a fellow semi-collapsed beside the trail with his pack still on. His pack looked enormous. He had pushed himself to hike up the mountain fast, and was feeling it. I told him about a great campsite I saw at the top of the mountain. 
At the Beauty Spot Gap I considered getting water and moving on, but it started raining again. I wanted the chance to see the view so I decided to wait until the morning to climb up to the Beauty Spot. There is camping at the road, but it's feet from the road and trucks pass regularly. I went down to get water and found people tenting on the hill. I decided to do likewise rather than risk an encounter with someone in a vehicle. 
Unfortunately this means that my tent is set up on a slope. And it's raining. The chances that my sleeping pad and bag will not slide and press up against the edge of the tent are about zero. I've done what I can to wedge things under my pad to make it more level, but gravity is a patient monster and usually wins. 
I'll get to Erwin tomorrow and hope to be able to dry out some there. I guess I'll stay at Uncle Johnnie's. I never have before, but without wheels it's the best option since they'll shuttle you into town. I'll need to buy groceries at a minimum. A couple of hot meals wouldn't go amiss either. 
My morale is suffering a little bit. A sunny day would go a long way toward helping, but there isn't one in the forecast. At least it's been comfortably warm so I haven't been dealing with hypothermia. I think I'm just worn down. My legs feel a bit leaden on hills. I eat constantly but I think I'm still losing weight - not that I object to that! But it's hard to feel energetic when you're in a calorie deficit. 
I knew this would be a lonely part of the hike, with fewer people around. But knowing it and experiencing it are two different things. Spending my days and nights alone makes me miss home even more. I'm finally ready for this adventure to be over, but I have a few hundred more miles to go. I know that I would have deep regret if I quit for anything less than catastrophic reasons. But I am definitely reaching the point of gritting my teeth to get the last part done.","

I couldn't find the moon through the clouds last night, but I guess some light penetrated the clouds because it was light enough out at 1 AM that I could see objects in my tent. When the sun rose it wasn't markedly brighter out. 
I was stunned to find that my attempts to stabilize my sleeping pad actually worked. My sleeping bag was not jammed against the end of the tent when I awoke. This meant it was dry. I so very much did not expect that. 
I was chagrined to find a half eaten beef stick tucked into a crevice of my fanny pack when I was fumbling for my phone. Way to tempt the bears. So my sleeping pad skills got a 10 but my bear bagging skills got a 1. Not that I've seen any bears in a very long time. 
It wasn't raining but it was very foggy when I started walking. There was minimal visibility on the Beauty Spot. I could see the trail and a few feet to either side. As soon as I got down off the ridge, though, sun started poking through. I stopped in my tracks and turned to face it. I closed my eyes and stood there soaking in the light. My feelings about hiking immediately skyrocketed. 
Feeling better about life, the universe, and everything, I bopped on down the trail. At Curley Maple Gap Shelter I was surprised to see it now has two levels and a big porch roof. It looks all fancy. 
There were a lot of wet leaves down on the trail. The bright reds and yellows were pretty but slippery. With fist sized loose rocks under the leaves it was pretty treacherous. I kept a death grip on my poles. I slipped a few times but managed not to go down. 
I got to Uncle Johnny's and got a bunk in the hostel. Immediately after checking in I saw JD - a welcome sight. I got my shower and we sat and chatted until dinner time. A calzone and a Walmart trip later I was resupplied and ready to head out again - after a day off to rest and heal, I'm thinking.","

That was an unanticipated but much needed and very welcome day off. I feel refreshed, positive, and ready to head back into the woods. I've had several good meals, healed my rashes, managed to retape my foot, and spent some quality time loving on some dogs. 
One of the dogs was actually involved in a horrifying incident today. A passing dog attacked the lovable, elderly Jerry Garcia. The owner was combative and threatened the guys here with a hammer as they tried to separate the dogs. Most dog fights end quickly but this went on for several minutes. 
When the police arrived, the owner finally got his dog to let go of Jerry. Jerry has a couple of punctures to the ear the dog was using to shake him like a rag doll. Really not much damage, considering. However, he's really unsteady. As a 16 year old very large dog, he's quite a senior citizen. It's like a 90 year old grandfather got mugged. I expect he'll feel worse tomorrow, since the other dog literally wiped the pavement with him. That's hard on an old body. 
Everybody here was very concerned of course. I'm an animal lover, with a special place in my heart for the old ones. I think it says a lot about a person who makes a home for an old animal. Jerry is no show dog. He's a stray who showed up here years ago. But he's well loved by many, and it warms my heart. 
After the fight, while the police were talking with people, I grabbed a cloth and started wiping slobber and blood off of Jerry so I could make sure he didn't have any serious wounds that needed immediate attention. That sweet old dog, who was shaken up from just being assaulted, let a stranger inspect his wounds. It's remarkable, really. 
Dog trauma aside, I've had a very pleasant stay here. I didn't expect this place to be so friendly and easy to be around. I can see why it turns into a vortex for some people. Me, though.. I'm ready to walk again.","

I woke up to the sound of pouring rain and I just couldn't do it. The forecast now included 30 mph wind gusts. Rain AND lightning okay. Rain AND lightning AND wind? I'm out. 
Instead I went out for a long, leisurely breakfast. And a long, leisurely lunch. If you're assuming that dinner was long and leisurely, you would be correct. Also it involved horchata, which makes me very happy. 
I procured a cheap thermometer so I might have a better idea of when I need to protect my water filter. I hope. It's cheapness isn't giving me great faith in the device. 
Walking around Walmart after dinner, my foot suddenly gave a huge twinge and hurt worse than  it has since Damascus. I didn't take a funny step or do anything unusual. I have had tape on it again since yesterday and it has been quite comfortable. I don't know what's up with it. Perhaps it will magically feel better in the morning. These things happen sometimes.","

I woke up and realized I had better visit the bathroom. When I looked up I was startled to see someone standing by the foot of my bed. Still stupid with sleep, I said ""Hello"".  It turned out to be Halloween getting something out of the refrigerator, which was at the foot of my bed. I realized that it must be morning. 
Upon returning to the bunkhouse, I checked my watch and saw that it was indeed morning. I fetched my own things from the fridge and ate a quick breakfast. Jerry Garcia whined quietly. I gave him a sliver of crust from my little Walmart mini pie. He received it graciously, gently taking it from my fingers without using his teeth. I'm going to miss that dog. 
I packed away my gear, trying to be as quiet as I could so as not to awaken BBQ. Using my headlamp, I checked around my bed for detritus, then stepped out into the morning. I moved to a chair on the front porch to charge my phone a little before heading out. I got to say goodbye to JD, Fearless, and Sierra Mist. I hope to see them again in Hot Springs, but trailwise they're only 30 miles from Hot Springs and I'm much farther away. 
The weather was much improved from yesterday morning. It was a cool, drizzly, misty morning. Mostly I didn't need more protection than my pack cover, but I kept my rain gear handy so I could add and remove layers as necessary. The day went by quickly as I climbed and climbed back up from town to the mountaintops. I stopped very briefly at No Business Knob Shelter to sit and eat a snack, then kept on walking. 
The day seemed to grow colder after noon, or maybe it was just me losing heat from being damp. I was glad that I had wimped out yesterday. It was uncomfortable today. It would have been truly miserable yesterday. 
I arrived at Whistling Gap at 5. With the time change, dark is around 6. I didn't want to night hike in the mist. My headlamp lights up individual droplets, like headlights in snow. They're virtually useless for seeing to walk in the mist. With the shelter over 3 miles away and thus not reachable in daylight, I called it a day. 
Nobody was at the campsite so I carried my whole pack down with me to get water. Climbing back up the hill, I set my tent up in the same spot that I used in 2015. My last camp chore was hanging a bear line. BBQ walked by while I was doing that. He said he was going to press on to the shelter. We bumped knuckles and then he walked out into the gloom as I continued casting my rock bag at a high branch. 
That task finally accomplished, I dove into my tent. I started water heating first thing, then attended to putting on dry clothes and inflating my sleeping pad. The stove blazed brightly. I couldn't find my standard yellow Heet in Hampton, so I purchased some isopropanol. It burns dirty, as it turns out. My cook kit will be a mess by the time I get to Hot Springs. 
With the chill, I looked forward to hot food for the first time in a while. I made my favorite freeze dried meal - scrambled eggs and bacon. I drank the excess water after it rehydrated, then added Colby Jack cheese. I experimented with putting the eggs on a tortilla, but they were too wet and I splooshed eggy water on myself in the tent. Serving issues aside, dinner was delicious. I made a mug of hot Propel as well. Mmmm. Hot juice drinks are fantastic. 
By now it was full dark. I got up to hang my food bags, but my headlamp was useless in the mist. It made me a little anxious to leave my tent, knowing it would be hard to find again. I finally found my hanging rope and secured the food. When I returned to the tent, my first try was in the wrong direction. But I made it there, and I don't intend to get far from it tonight. 
A cold breeze has sprung up. My tent is situated broadside to it. The mist is soaking the mesh and blowing it toward me. This is not the weather in which a down bag shines. I sure hope for a good night's sleep. It doesn't look like a sure thing.","

I stayed cozy, but when I awoke the world was a very damp place. The mesh of my tent was soaked from fog. I put the flaps down before I went to sleep, which I think did help. My sleeping bag had beads of water on the fabric. I mopped them up semisuccessfully. 
It wasn't incredibly cold, and I didn't have a good place to light the stove thanks to the light rain. So I skipped coffee and drank cold water with breakfast. 
It took a long time to pack while trying to avoid wet surfaces. Eventually I managed it. I put on every single wet weather item. The pack cover, of course, with its hood deployed. My raincoat, rain skirt, waterproof socks, and knee high gaiters. I had my regular gaiters on underneath so they'd be handy when I took off the tall gaiters, but it was never an issue. 
Half an hour into my hike, I felt drained. I wondered what was wrong. Not enough food? Sick? Worn down from 1800 miles? Then I remembered I hadn't made coffee. Rookie mistake. Luckily I had electrolyte and caffeine capsules handy. I swallowed one and soon I was feeling good. 
Like yesterday, I walked in fog and drizzle all day. As a result there wasn't much to see. I didn't rest much because I didn't want to get cold. Big Bald didn't look like much. 
I ran into 2010 LASHer Bumpin with his dog Heidi. They were out for a damp day hike. On their way back past me, he gave me his contact information in case I needed anything while I was in the vicinity. So thoughtful!  I don't really need anything other than the sun and maybe some warmth. But it's nice to be asked. 
The last two miles took forever. I got to the shelter in time to get water. Since I've been here before I knew it was a long trail down.  Nobody else was here so I took my pack. Just as well so I had something to carry the water in on the way back up. 
I made freeze dried lasagna for dinner, and I made the whole package. Usually I make half of these. This one said it served 2.5, but I had no problem eating all of it. I think the cooler weather is making me burn more energy. 
This shelter has both bear cables and a privy. Such luxury! It's been a while since the last privy. I know there are a few more privyless shelters in my future. I hate that. Even a tiny privy with half walls is a vast improvement over digging a hole. 
The next two days I have 15+ mile walks if I want to stay in a shelter, which I do. Given how late I hiked the last two days, I can't walk 15 miles between dawn and dusk. Also my headlamp is useless if it's foggy. I guess I'll give it a shot and hope for no fog.","

My lasagna last night tasted great. The lasagna farts I had later on were not as great. I was glad, after all, that I was in the shelter alone. 
In the morning it was so cozy in my bag that I didn't want to get up. Finally I felt myself start to stretch, starting from my toes and going all the way up. With resignation I gave in and got dressed. After fetching my food bags, I made coffee. Hell yeah I made coffee. There was frost sparkling on the ground. Hot coffee was called for. I made it a double. 
I thought I was pretty late, but thanks to the time change, it was 7:45 when I started walking. I wore most of my warm gear, including my waterproof socks over my Wright socks. Even so, my hands and feet were mostly numb for the first hour or so. As the sun got higher, it was warm on East facing slopes and cold on west facing slopes. I added or removed clothing every time I switched sides of a mountain. 
A giant cloud reared its head. It looked like it was going to engulf the trail. My only hope was outhiking it. I power walked for an hour. I was surprised to actually outwalk it. The clouds descended through a mountain pass one mountain over.  I ended up walking in sunshine all day. 
I was surprised to arrive at tonight's shelter before dark. Yay caffeine and power walking! I was happy to see human beings. I was even more happy to see that they had a fire going in the shelter's fireplace. They're a group that has been hiking together for many years. They're good company and funny. It's nice.","

Thanks to the fire, the tarp, or the body heat provided by the men in the shelter, it didn't drop below freezing inside. I slept with my reservoir but not my Sawyer bag or my water bottle, so I was pleased. Also it wasn't as cold in my sleeping bag as it could have been. I'm sure looking forward to my liner bag, though. 
The ground was covered in a heavy layer of frost when I started walking. As soon as I got up on the ridge and the wind hit me, it was brutally cold. I bundled up with my Dirty Harry serape / tiny owls baby blanket. And as much other gear as I could lay hands on. 
Shortly after Firescald Mountain I started seeing dog footprints. And then a dog nudged my leg. A hunting dog with two antennas was hiking the trail. I saw him off and on all morning. He was in excellent condition so I figured he had not been out long. I hope he found his way back to his owner. 
I stopped in at Little Laurel Shelter but I didn't stay long. I had a long day ahead. Unfortunately, soon after I started walking again, I started feeling crummy for no obvious reason. Feverish, tummy ache, fatigue. It made for a long afternoon. I still managed to walk to the shelter before sundown, barely. I even got water before it got too dark to see. 
The same guys from last night were here too. It was so nice to walk up to a group of friendly faces. We all sat around a fire for a while, then moved to our sleeping bags. The guys held a singalong, which I think is charming. 
The only other thing of note today was the bear I saw. I heard a ruckus uphill from me. I looked up to see the south end of a northbound bear. He was just a little fellow. I imagine he's pretty scared right now with all the dogs and hunters out. As a matter of fact I heard dogs and then gunshots down in the valley a little while before I ran into this guy. I'm feeling pretty good about all the blaze orange I'm wearing.","

Boy it was chilly last night. Wind came in through the floor and stole heat. Eric had his hammock strung up across the front of the shelter. To get out to pee I had to crawl under him ungracefully. I rammed him from underneath as I failed to crawl low enough. In the morning I confessed. And then so did several other people. I didn't feel as bad about it after that. 
I found a dozen nuts in my pack when I got up. John, whose pack was next to mine, found several dozen. Whatever critter put them there wasn't that bright. It's one thing to stow them in a structure, but in a bag that wasn't there yesterday? Not a great idea. 
I was so cold by the time I got done with breakfast that I could barely feel my hands and feet. I walked for over an hour before I got warm enough to start removing layers, and it took another hour to get all the feeling back in my feet. My mom says the east coast is having record cold, and I believe her. It certainly feels colder to me than November usually does. 
My day went by quickly with the destination of town in mind. I stopped first at the laundromat, finding it with an open sign but locked up. Then I stopped at the outfitter for my package. I forgot that Neon had sent me one! Thanks, dear heart! So I had a surprise package as well as my box from JD. He sent me more of my cold weather gear. My 20 degree bag isn't cutting it, so he sent my 40 degree quilt to layer with it. I'm also subbing in my NeoAir Xtherm for my Klymit pad, which is for some reason cold despite being insulated. And JD sent my JetBoil. My alcohol stove is a pain at these temps and in wind, to the point that I've skipped meals rather than deal with it. That's a pretty stupid thing to do, but when I'm tired and cold at the end of the day, any impediment is enough to stop me in my tracks. I hope my easy to use Jetboil simplifies dinner and breakfast and helps my tired, cold self make hot food. 
After the outfitter I stopped by the motel. A note said to check in at Tobacco Road. That turned out to be the business next door. But the guy at the desk said no rooms were open because the maid hadn't showed up. I walked outside, pondering my options, and JD and Fearless pulled up! After a brief discussion I joined them and we all went to Elmer's. I've been here, in the early 2000s. It hasn't changed much. 
We three hikers showered and went to Iron Horse Station for an excellent dinner. It was great to see JD and Fearless. I'm probably three days behind them now, so who knows if I'll see them again. But I keep running into them so I hope history repeats itself. 
My foot and I are looking forward to a day off and lots of town food tomorrow. Then I'll head off Smokies-ward. As of today I have 273 miles left to go. I can't even describe how eager I am to get home to my loved ones again. A few more weeks of cold hiking and I'll have accomplished what I set out to do.  Soon. Very soon.","

Oh my goodness. Sleeping in a warm comfortable bed was ecstasy. I woke up so happy. I'm glad I chose the cooler of the rooms offered. The warm one was appealing when I got here all chilly, but I would have roasted overnight. 
I walked across the street to the Smoky Mountain Diner for a little breakfast, then returned to my room to try to get organized. My antique filled room. I'm pretty sure it's the same one I stayed in 15 years ago. The Earl Shaffer room. Anyway, I sorted and planned and generally got ready for the day. 
I spent quite a while at Bluff Mountain Outfitters. I'm heading into the Smokies this week and I would like to be as warm and comfortable as possible. I think I'm good now, with the possible exception of a chance of snow. I'm not carrying any spikes. But I think that's probably overkill. It might be a little slick if it snows but it shouldn't be the sort of ice you see at the end of winter. 
I have hand warmers galore. And I bought a Nalgene to use as a hot water bottle. I waffled on the size of fuel canister to pick up. I finally decided on a small one since I'll have many opportunities to get another canister as I head south. 
After mailing home some redundant items, I spent the rest of the day sorting, packing, and resting. Also petting Elmer's adorable dog Carter and stunningly beautiful cat Pearl. They make great hostel pets as they apparently like everybody. 
I've had a big dinner and I'm all packed up. In the morning I'll eat a little breakfast and vamoose. I think I'll sleep a lot warmer now, which does great things for my daily happiness level. Yay hiking!","

It got a little spooky upstairs in the hostel overnight. I could hear things banging in the hallway. I was the only one up there last night. I told myself it was probably the cat but when I got up to visit the bathroom later, no cat and nothing disturbed. Later, as I was ready to leave, I put my backpack on in my room. I turned to the door with my hand out to grab the knob and found the door already opening toward me. Two days there and the door had never opened on its own. I stepped through and turned to close the door, but the door was shutting behind me. Spooky. I'm going to assume it was the house saying farewell. 
As I walked out into the day it was a little after dawn. I saw three people packing cars at the trailhead, but I didn't see anybody hiking all day. I walked uphill for nearly the whole day, finally reaching the summit of Bluff Mountain mid afternoon. Right before the summit I saw a tiny one man tent set up. The door was open but I couldn't see anyone. There was a military pack leaning against a fallen tree nearby. It felt a little wrong, with no signs of life at that time of day. I stared at it until I devised a reasonable explanation. Perhaps the hiker had set up a base camp and then gone hunting or birding. Maybe they were down the hillside digging a cat hole. I moved on. 
When I got to the shelter, it was empty. I walked on down to the water and scooped out three liters, then walked back up to the shelter and unpacked. I started water boiling for dinner while I made myself a comfortable bed. My NeoAir Xtherm and two quilts layered are about as good as it gets for me. 
Dinner was still rehydrating when a hiker with a dog walked up. Tom Horn and his little dog Geronimo were pooped. He got them water and they both ate some leftover pork loin he had packed. He didn't have the energy to do more. I could relate. Many of my evenings have gone that way. 
Tom Horn was a great conversationalist. We had a conversation that lasted until it got dark and we both fell asleep. Right before I fell into that deep well, he suddenly remembered the name of a mountain that neither of us could remember and it had driven us both crazy. ""Killington."" I gave him a heartfelt thank you and then sleep stole over me.","

I was luxuriously warm last night. For the first time on the trail in recent memory, I was warm enough to unclench from the fetal position into something more comfortable. As a result I woke up feeling great. In the darkness I walked over to the bear cables to retrieve my food. Soon I had hot coffee and a poptart in my hands. I was very happy. 
On the other side of the shelter, Tom Horn woke up and exclaimed at what a good night's sleep he'd had. While I ate, changed clothes, and packed, we talked about this and that. 
It occurs to me that you might be wondering about the changing of the clothes while I'm four feet from a stranger. Like most other hikers, I've gotten pretty good at getting dressed inside my sleeping bag. Even if nobody else is there, I often change there when it's cold. Mostly my pants. I have been sleeping in my hiking shirt if it's dry enough, so it often doesn't come off. I take my bra off while my shirt is still on. My shirt and I are both flexible enough to let me pull my arms inside without flashing anything. I barely even think about it anymore. I certainly don't interrupt my conversation. In Stratton, I held a full conversation with another hiker while she changed every stitch of her clothing in a laundromat - never revealing anything she shouldn't. It's a useful skill. 
I was enjoying Tom Horn's company enough that I didn't start walking until 8:30. That was fine, though. I didn't have a long day planned. The sun had warmed the air a little, which was nice. There was still frost on the grass so my shoes got a little wet. I was gratified to find that fields that had been full of briars on previous hikes had been mowed down so they were grassy and pretty. I could see great views from them. I walked along, beaming at how pretty the world was today. 
I stopped right before Max Patch to eat, expecting it to be raucously windy up top. For once it was calm. I met three other hikers who congratulated me on my assumed to be successful thru hike, and told me how proud of me they were. This happens now on most days that I meet dayhikers. It's weird but nice. 
Between weather and terrain and company, I had a great day. It makes me feel almost ashamed how much my mood correlates with the weather. I'd like to have the emotional stability to maintain my mood based on my own internal workings, but I don't. I'm at the mercy of the world around me. That's fine on beautiful days, but it doesn't work out so well when the weather is bad. 
Later in the afternoon I ran into trail angel Apple. Actually I found chairs and an SUV and a geodesic dome, first. I walked up to the dome to look at it. When I turned around, I finally saw Apple in the vehicle. He said he must have fallen asleep. The dome was the frame for a heated tent that I was welcome to stay in. I declined that but accepted a coke, donut, and miniature apple pie before taking my leave. The food powered me up over the last mountain of the day. 
It started to rain when I was a hundred yards from the shelter. I hurried in, but it stopped right away and so far hasn't started again. A section hiker is here, tented a short distance away. I'm in the least sloping section of the shelter. Multiple people have told me that this is one of the worst shelters they've seen. Based on those I've stayed in recently, it's fairly average in my opinion. It's no Taj Mahal but it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. 
I made freeze dried chicken teriyaki for dinner. It was surprisingly good. I'm not sure if my standards have fallen, if I'm just that hungry, or if the food was as good as it seemed.","

It rained on and off all night. I was smug at my situation, all warm and dry under a roof. It conveniently stopped raining just as I was ready to get up. One hot coffee and poptart later, I was ready to face the world. 
The climb up and down Snowbird was far easier than I remembered. I'm at the point of the south where I was still building thruhiker legs going north on my last thru. It's quite pleasant to walk those same hills with minimal effort now. Instead of dying I can look around and appreciate the beauty. Today fog made it quiet and serene on top of the mountain. 
When I got to the turnoff for the hostel, I was still undecided about staying or just buying supplies and moving on. But as I walked up the gravel road my foot let me know that rest would be good. Yesterday afternoon it gave a few vicious twinges. Today I got some warning pains that made me gasp. Definitely time to rest. 
I took a hot shower in the distinctive beer bottle wall shower stall. I used the shampoo that was there, so I guess I smell pretty manly now. I mostly showered for the benefit of others. I didn't really feel dirty. Getting dry and dressed again was a trial. I think that's my last shower of the year in an unheated room. I'm holding out for heat from now on. 
Much of my life right now revolves around heat and the lack of it, now that I think of it. 
A section hiker, David / Grandaddy Longlegs, arrived shortly after me. He gave me some batteries, so now I don't need to worry about using my headlamp too much. He also offered to drive me to dinner when he went. We ended up at Janice's Diner in Cosby. Our dinners were cheap, filling, and tasty. It looked like the sort of place where one might get good meatloaf, and indeed it was. I couldn't finish everything, which made me sad. David even bought me dinner! I paid the tip and thanked him. 
Gator got a fire going in the wood stove in the bunkhouse. I expect I'm going to have a warm and comfy night. And then I expect that I'm going to suffer through the Smokies. I'm definitely going to break them up into to sections and go to Gatlinburg in between. Rain and 50 mph winds, in the teens and snowy.. it looks like I'm going to be experiencing quite a lot of inclement weather. I think I'll be all right, but I don't know that I'll enjoy it.","

Despite a cat with a killer reputation sleeping next to me, I felt something scrabble over my head during the night. I shrieked and flailed. I fumbled for my headlamp and looked around, but I saw nothing. I fell back asleep and was undisturbed for the rest of the night. 
In the morning I ate breakfast with the cat, who appeared to be pretty interested in my food. I didn't feed her anything but love. She's a big time cuddler and was happy to drape on my shoulder like Andy used to. I don't meet too many friendly cats on the trail so I was delighted and petted her lavishly. 
As I walked away from the hostel, I was clean, dry, full, and happy. The sky was a gorgeous clear blue. All was well with my world. I began climbing up into the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. My general feeling was one of low level ecstasy. 
The Smokies have some vegetation that I haven't seen anywhere else. There are plants that look like they've come out of a Dr Seuss illustration. On the characteristic narrow ridges of the area, the abundance of grasses and small trees gives an otherworldly feel. At one point I startled something that looked like nothing so much as a small fairy fleeing from my steps. It was all gorgeous. 
Two women on Arab horses passed me going up the mountain. I admired their horses, who navigated the rocks with competence. I noticed that they were wearing removable boots, and at least one was wearing a bitless rope bridle. I heartily approved of the horses and their women. I tried to imagine Pluto riding these narrow trails on steep ridges. I'm thinking that might be a suicidal ride. 
I arrived at the shelter at a quarter to 4. It was early to stop, but with dark at 5:30 and the next shelter 7 miles away, I was home for the night. I set up my sleeping gear in the shelter and moved out of the sleeping area to make dinner. Standing Bear had not had dinners that enticed me, so I had decided to eat things left over from my last resupply. Dinner tonight was a cup of miso soup, a hot Propel, a Gatorade whey protein bar, and some Sahale nut mix. Not as satisfying as chicken teriyaki, but it was hot, had plenty of protein, and probably sufficient calories. 
Today was a gorgeous clear fall day that had me walking in my shirtsleeves most of the day. Tomorrow the weather will be worse. At least I got one gorgeous day in the Smokies. I'm confident that I have the gear to keep me safe if not super happy.","

It was a beautiful sunrise. You know that old saying? ""Red sky by night, sailors delight. Red sky by morning, sailors are totally screwed."" Yeah, that one. 
I had my coffee and poptart as I stared at the sunrise. Eventually everyone else woke up and I felt comfortable going into the shelter to pack up. If possible I prefer to spare others the noise. Luckily today there were no super late sleepers. Soon I was ready to go. I chose to put my tent inside the pack today so I could keep my rain gear handy in the side pocket that the tent usually occupies. I put my raincoat there in readiness. I also kept out my waterproof socks. 
I started hiking wearing no rain gear as the sky was clear. Over the next line of mountains I could see dark clouds. I kept an eye on them. They gradually crept closer until they engulfed the trail. I walked in clouds for a while. After an hour or so, the trees started to drip. I swapped my wind breaker for my rain coat. My rain skirt and pole covers were already deployed to keep me warm. 
Around lunch time I arrived at Tricorner Knob Shelter. I pulled out crackers and cheese to quickly eat. On a raw day like today, I can't take a long break or I'll get chilled. While I ate, I assessed my state. I was a little chilly, but not too bad. I had plenty of energy. The weather was deteriorating, but I figured I could endure it for another 2 or 3 miles. I took off my shoes so I could put my waterproof socks on, then shod myself and added knee high waterproof gaiters. I also dug out my fleece top and put it on. I had been a little chilly in just my wicking shirt and raincoat. I knew I would sweat, but it was better than getting cold. 
Two shelter companions from last night arrived before I left. They both decided they were done for the day. I told them to think of me as they lay snug in their warm sleeping bags. Right before I left I queued up an audiobook and then wrapped my phone in a maze of plastic. Unless I fell in a pond, the phone should stay dry. 
I put my raincover hoody on and snaked my earbuds through all my layers. It was quite windy but with all my armor it wasn't uncomfortable to hike. I chugged along, intent on the story unfolding in my ears. Other than watching my step, I didn't pay much attention to the trail. It wasn't much fun to be on a mountaintop right then. 
Before long I reached the shelter turnoff. I scouted for water but found only a few gross puddles. I remembered a trickle partway down the shelter trail, though. Sure enough it was running. I collected some water and continued to the shelter. It was empty, of course. I assessed my condition. A little sweaty and damp, but not cold. Good. No need to dive into my bag yet. 
I set up my sleeping gear, then moved my cooking gear and food out to the porch area. I made my little Thai noodle soup as well as a hot drink. The soup tasted great. It left my mug pretty gross - remnants of oil and spices stuck to the sides. I figure if coffee doesn't evict them tomorrow, I'll wipe it out with leaves or something. 
With darkness falling, I hung my foodbag. It was time to get into dry clothes and get in my bag for a doubtlessly long night. First, though, I boiled the remainder of my water and poured it into my Nalgene. I screwed the lid on tight and stuck the hot bottle in my sleeping bag. I left the stove nearby in case I wanted to reheat the water later. The fuel canister went into the sleeping bag, as well as my double bagged water filter, my eye drops, and anything else I thought shouldn't be left to freeze. My damp undergarments, gloves, and pants all joined the party. It's a wee bit crowded in my sleeping bag. Good thing it's a big one. Oh, and I wrapped my water bladder in my rain skirt and stuck it in there too. I don't think freezing would do it any good. 
After I climbed in, myself, the rain started really coming down. The forecast calls for it to change to mixed precipitation within a few hours. I hope the rain holds out for a while. I'm prepared to walk in a little snow, but several inches would be daunting. For now it's reassuring to hear the storm raging. When it changes to hissing is when I'll start to fret. 
I wouldn't mind company in the shelter but I doubt I'll see any. It's after 7 and it's pouring cold rain. It would take a hardy soul to still be out there hiking. I'm telling myself that even the bears will want to stay home tonight.","

Last night was scary. First my stupid brain wouldn't let up about bears. Every time the wind shook the tarp I turned on my headlamp to check. And the tarp shook a LOT. There was a full on storm going on, with roaring wind and pounding rain. I finally managed to fall asleep, and then woke up to a sharp crack. I heard the sound of things breaking, first well away from me and then rapidly approaching. I had enough time to realize a tree was falling in my direction and start saying ""no, no, no, no!"" And then a ""WHUMP"" shook the shelter. I turned on my headlamp yet again to look around. I saw nothing. I had one of those just-avoided-a-bad-car-accident feelings. I could have been dead. I could have just had a massive blunt force trauma. I could be pinned in the wreckage of a shelter, dying of exposure. It took a long time for my heart to settle down after that. 
Given the racket from the storm and the anxiety from the tree falling, I didn't sleep very well. I let myself sleep in a little this morning to make up some of the difference, but I was still up before 7. When I looked out, I saw inches of snow around the shelter. I told myself I better get fully dressed, at least on my bottom half, before I waded out there. 
Oddly enough, I felt very warm during the night. When I eventually got phone signal, I learned that the day's temperature had actually peaked at midnight, at 40 degrees. After which it snowed. Weather is weird. 
I found the bear cable snap frozen in place and had to whack it a few times to open it. Then my food bag Velcro was frozen. Never fear, I was able to have poptarts and coffee. Given the ongoing snow, I ate inside the tarped area of the shelter. I figured that hypothermia trumped bears. 
I packed up and got going. I left a full warm dry layer in the pack. I wore my fleece top today. It was a compromise- a little too warm on uphills, a little too cool on downhills. 
The first order of business was bushwhacking around the fallen tree. It had fallen crossing the shelter trail about 100 feet from the shelter. The base of it had shattered at ground level. It was impressive, if annoying to walk around. 
Next was visiting the privy. It had partial walls, which meant I got snowed on as I used it. Actual bathrooms are a thing that I will appreciate when I get home. This time of year, especially. Toilet seats at subfreezing temperatures are pretty special. 
Given the tree incident, I wondered if I would be climbing over lots of fallen trees today, but that wasn't the case. Mostly it was just careful slogging through a couple of inches of snow. It seemed to take forever. Putting on an audiobook helped until moisture zapped my headphones and I had to take them off. 
I felt like an amazing badass crossing mountaintops with only my footprints in the snow. Or an idiot. Either way it was pretty stupendous. 
Near lunchtime I met two dayhikers with a bear dog trailing them. The dog was starving to death. I didn't even know how she was still standing up. I don't think she would survive another night in those conditions. I tried to get her some food from my pack, but she kept trying to eat my gear so it slowed me down. She left to follow the other hikers before I could get the food out. I really hope they were able to get her to her owner. Or at least take her in and feed her. I petted her briefly and the way she closed her eyes and leaned into it just melted my heart. 
I reached Newfound Gap at 3:30 and was dumbfounded to see it still and empty. The roads weren't snowy. I dug out my down jacket and warm hat, then started making calls. A taxi service said they could be there in an hour. An hour is a long time when it's below freezing and very windy. I started looking for a protected place to wait, but then I heard voices. I'm generally not one to ask strangers for anything, but I needed help. 
They said they might need to make two trips because they already had five people, but they could take me to town. I was so grateful. I canceled the cab and went to wait in the miraculously open and heated bathrooms. 
They managed us all in one trip by holding backpacks on laps and putting me in the cargo area. I would happily have held all of the packs on my lap. The road stayed empty, as it was closed! Chelsea had to call and get a ranger to let us out. Once past that barrier, we drove in to Gatlinburg. I had intended to visit the Smoky Mountain Brewery, and they did too. I asked if I could eat with them since I was alone. It was so great to feel like part of their group. I was extra touched when Mousetrap (AT 2013) said they would get my dinner. They dropped me off at a motel and went on their way. 
Sadly it's not the Grand Prix, which I hear has closed or been sold. But it's clean, it has heat, and it's centrally located. My plan of buying supplies tonight fell through when I immediately got in the bed instead of dutifully trekking out. It occurs to me now that the road may still be closed tomorrow anyway. It's not like anything is going to melt overnight. 
The trails were dangerously icy for the last few miles into Newfound Gap. I definitely want them to have time to melt. I'm not sure how I avoided falling today. I don't want to press my luck.","

For some reason I woke up before 5 today. I never fell back asleep, either. What's up with that, brain? Did you decide we don't need sleep now?
The road to Newfound Gap was still closed this morning. I didn't know that when I paid for another night at the motel. I just knew I wanted to give the mountains a little time to thaw. 
I ate the skimpy motel breakfast, then waited for the outfitter to open. I bought surprisingly little there. They had plenty of freeze dried food, but minimal variety. At least I got a backup fuel canister. It'll probably get me all the way to the end of the trail. I pondered getting spikes, but I think the uneven support would really hurt my sore foot. Which might be a moot point if it's so slippery that I end up on my butt. 
At Old Grandad's General Store, I bought snacks and stuff. I had to ask them to find me coffee, as none was on the shelves. Coffee is more necessary than the dang fuel. I can drink coffee cold if need be. The shopping was tricky because everything I looked at literally made me drool. Which is awkward. I threw some extra snacks into the cart to eat right away. Turns out pecan logs aren't as good as I remembered they were. 
I went to Bennett's for lunch. Pulled pork BBQ. Not as good as JD's. It was filling and reasonably tasty. The waitress was psychic. I hope they get at least a living wage, because she really deserves it. Somebody who knows what you want before you do makes spectacular waitstaff. 
I pondered sightseeing but figured it would be better to rest my foot, so I returned to my motel room. It's quite pleasant. I love yellow rooms, so I find mine to be very welcoming. The bed is very comfortable as well. It has those sheets with the alternating matte and shiny stripes. So soft, and plain but also pretty. 
Stepping out for dinner at a busy restaurant made me feel lonely. I would rather have eaten something alone in my room rather than surrounded by happy people talking to each other. It made my meal feel strictly utilitarian. Enough calories acquired, check. Sufficient fluids, check. Goal accomplished. Eating was necessary but not fun. 
I'm looking forward to being out in the woods again tomorrow, where I don't feel lonely because being alone is normal. 
It took a surprising number of calls to arrange a ride back. My resources had wrong numbers, disconnected numbers, businesses not operating at this time of year, and businesses misrepresented. I did finally get a lead on Uptown Cabs, who offered a reasonable price and could pick me up at a reasonable time. That was a relief. I also called and made a dinner reservation for Thanksgiving, which contrasts oddly with the rest of my hike. But I should arrive in town again on Thanksgiving, and I'm pretty sure if I don't have a reservation I won't be able to find anywhere to eat at all. 
I'm getting close enough to the end of my hike to start thinking about how to get home, but not close enough to nail down a day. Frustrating. I must have left my precognitive beanie in my other backpack.","

Trash bear came back. I'm sure he's a regular visitor. I stuck my head out my door after a clang. Only to find a posse of half dressed men talking about the enormous bear, who apparently had taken off into the garage. I wished they would just let him fish through the trash and be done with it. Instead everyone stood around discussing the situation instead of going to bed. Somehow they also managed to tap my door and window repeatedly, which was annoying. All of it was annoying. 
In the morning, I could hear the same voices when I awoke. Apparently they needed, or got, even less sleep than me. Dandy. 
I ate breakfast in my room, in no mood to join the crowd at the lackluster breakfast bar. I had purchased a bearclaw, which tasted good with the pot of coffee I made. I stuffed the last items in my pack and walked up front to check out. 
My cab driver turned out to be an older woman - the dispatcher's mom. She was pleasant to talk to. I think I was just enjoying having a conversation with another human being. She added a friendly tone to the morning that hadn't been there before. 
The trail was still a little icy but much more manageable than it had been the morning after the storm. I only had one small slip, which didn't result in injury or fall. So footing-wise, today was a definite improvement. 
Clingman's Dome was open but really not in great shape. You can see rebar through the concrete. The structure was jam packed with tourists and whining children. I shot a couple of pictures but didn't linger. 
At Double Spring Gap I stopped for water. There was a lone hiker there. I regretted leaving, knowing that it was unlikely that I would have company at the next shelter. But I wasn't tired, and I really wanted to get to Fontana Dam for Thanksgiving. Cutting it short today would have made that difficult. 
Sure enough, this shelter is empty. There's a tarp up, which is noisily flapping. I'm not sure how well I'll sleep through it. Well enough, I guess. Given that I'll be in my sleeping bag for twelve hours, I'm sure I'll manage to get sufficient rest. 
I decided to lay my sleeping bag sideways in the shelter. It's a little tight under the bunk to maneuver my head to the back wall, and sleeping with my head out makes me feel vulnerable. If another hiker shows up I can move, although that seems unlikely. And even set up sideways, there is still room for a bunch more people. 
Although I haven't seen any bears in the park, and barely any scat, there are lots of signs warning of the dangers. And I know that the park has one of the highest densities of bears in the country. It makes me paranoid. The bears are likely all denned up and not an issue, but my subconscious disagrees. Despite the beauty of the Smokies, I'll be glad to leave the park so I can camp where I feel less inundated with the idea of bears.","

It was foggy and drippy when I got up at 5:30 to answer the call of nature. I got back in my sleeping bag, which turned out to be an excellent strategy. At 6:30 when I got up again, the sky was dawning clear. Much better. 
It seemed like I climbed all day. That isn't correct or even possible, but that's how it felt. Another southbound hiker brought it up, so it wasn't just me. It also felt cold all day. It wasn't that cold - I think the high was in the upper 40s. But the trail followed the ridge line most of the day, leaving me exposed to the wind. I needed my gloves pretty much full time. In mid afternoon I switched from my raincoat to my less steamy windbreaker, but that's as far as the disrobing went. I hiked wearing tights under my pants in an effort to keep feeling in my butt. It failed, and I never felt so warm that I wanted to remove the extra insulation. 
I'm looking forward to hiking at lower elevation. Maybe it will be a little warmer. Or maybe it's late fall and it's cold everywhere. 
There was no privy at last night's shelter so I needed to dig a cat hole today. Since I was walking on a narrow ridge all day, it took a very long time to find an appropriate spot. Given the weather, there were a lot of requirements to meet. It needed to be in a spot protected from the wind and in the sun. It needed to be invisible from the trail. I needed to be able to get to it safely, so it couldn't be on a steep slope. It took me until 3 pm to find a place. I was about to explode by that point. I greeted my little haven with a great deal of relief. 
The other hiker said he was going to try to make it to this shelter tonight, but he's not here. I don't know if he pooped out and stayed st Spence Field, or had a burst of energy and moved on to Mollie's Ridge. Either way it's just me and a mouse for company tonight. I saw a small bear less than a mile from the shelter so I suppose I might have ursine company as well. Probably not, though. 
I have a bit less than 16 trail miles to go tomorrow, plus 2 road miles to the lodge. I hope I can get a ride. I don't want to be late for my dinner reservation. The two miles of road walking wouldn't do my foot any favors, either. The shuttle sadly doesn't run this time of year. My plan is to attempt to get up at 5:30 or 6 so I can be walking by first light. That would give me an extra two miles. Plus a lot of tomorrow is downhill. That should help. Being motivated by hot food and a hot shower may help most of all.","

I turned out the light at 7:30 last night. I slept like a log. Maybe I'm finally getting over my fear of empty shelters? Although of course it wasn't just me. It was me plus some number of mice. They didn't bother me or eat any of my gear, but I woke up surrounded by mouse poops. When I got up to pee at 5:30, they apparently raced over during the minutes I was gone and pooped again. I don't understand mice. 
7:30-5:30 means 10 hours of sleep. Thruhikers sleep a lot. We're tired, there's nothing to do at night, it's too cold to be out of the sleeping bag this time of year at night, and we need to preserve our headlamp batteries. There is no other time in my life when I get so much sleep as when I'm on a long hike. It's nice. 
I got up an hour early so I could be walking as soon as I could pretty much see. I started walking about half an hour before sunrise. I wore my headlamp but only turned it on inside rhododendron tunnels. The headlamp wasn't super helpful. It needed new batteries. I kept it on my head for a while just because it was warm. My fingers and toes went numb almost immediately after I left the shelter. My fingers warmed up after I put my pole covers on, but my toes just had to suffer. 
After the fierce cold of recent days, it was shocking to feel the warm sun on me. I slowly and suspiciously removed layers, sure that I would turn a corner into a refrigerator again. This scenario has happened a lot recently. Areas of mountain that never see direct sunlight stay frozen when it's reasonably warm elsewhere. But today I found no hidden ice pockets once the day was well underway. It was pleasant, when I took a break, to sit for a while without shivering. 
I walked as fast as I could, but some areas were treacherous due to deep leaf piles. I sort of skated down those parts. I'm pretty sure my not falling down was more luck than skill. My shoe treads are getting a little slick, too. I'll be glad to pick up my last pair of new shoes at the NOC. This pair only needs to make it another 30 miles or so. Their failure mode is odd. The treads still look deep but don't grip as well. The lining is shredding and taking my socks with it. The mesh is developing holes. Deep grooves have appeared in the sides of the sole, indicating that the interior of the sole is breaking down. I think it's odd that the tread appears to be the toughest part of the shoe. 
I tried to call for a shuttle at the dam but had no cell signal so I hitched. A really nice family picked me up and bravely let me sit next to them in the back seat. They drove me right up to Fontana Lodge. I told them they were one of the things I was thankful for today. I'm also thankful for a generous friend who paid for a night at the lodge for me. 
The lodge seems to have had some work done since the last time I was here. The room I have seems a lot nicer, the shower has better looking and more functional hardware, the water in the shower is high pressure and hot. The place is also kind of packed. I didn't realize it was a big holiday destination. They've already decorated for Christmas so it's looking pretty. I'm a sucker for twinkly lights. 
I bought my resupply food and sat in the laundromat while my clothes washed. With a belly full of Thanksgiving buffet, all my needs are met. I even saw friendly faces. Izzy and Detour were in the restaurant when I got there. I haven't seen them in hundreds of miles, since Detour hurt his knee and they were planning to take several days off in Damascus. 
The weather is predicted to be pleasant, as in not life threatening, for several days. I'm super excited. I love being able to walk without constantly assessing myself for frostbite and hypothermia.","

The bed was so comfy that my body gave me lip about leaving in the morning. It tried hard to persuade me that staying another day was an excellent life choice that would reap multiple benefits. I pointed out that the weather would be excellent today and it would be far more fun to hike in sunshine than the inevitable cold wet weather in our future. I won, but my body retaliated by being stubbornly sluggish all day. 
I skipped the restaurant in favor of coffee and a pastry in my room. I sat around until 8:30 because the desk lady said to come up and ask for a ride between 8:30 and 9. I went up and checked out, then waited briefly. A maintenance man offered me a ride. I tried to pay him when we got to the trailhead but he wouldn't take my money so I offered my thanks and hefted my pack out of the truck. 
I met a friendly mother daughter pair on the way up the mountain and had a nice little conversation. I think that's all the people I talked to until the very end of the day.
Despite my coffee, my legs were dragging today. With my late start, lunchtime came early. I sat on a log and ate Chex mix and a piece of cheese. I briefly felt revived, but not for as long as I wished. Also I was slipping like crazy on roots covered with leaves. I did actually fall down today on two occasions, but didn't take any damage. 
At Cable Gap Shelter I stopped to filter water. I sort of wanted to stay and sleep. With a sigh I got up and started walking again. My progress was slow and it didn't look like I would make this shelter before dark. I gave up and took a caffeine capsule. The rest of the miles came more easily. 
Right before the shelter I heard somebody behind me and stepped off the trail so he could pass. He asked if I were Mrs Joy and said he'd been just behind me for days. He introduced himself as Lizard King. He started two months later than I did. I'll see him pass me tomorrow but probably not again after that. 
He came down to the shelter to eat dinner with me and the mice. We had a good conversation. Both of us are thinking about life after the trail. It's a pretty tough transition from the simple life of hiking, eating, and sleeping to the stress and complexity of a modern American life. I'm afraid I haven't had any brilliant ideas about carrying my thruhiker life over into the real world. Maybe in the next two weeks a lightbulb will go off?","

Man I slept great. The mice apparently left me alone. At 5:15 I persuaded myself to get up so I could get to the NOC at a reasonable time tonight. I guess I should have slept in because it was still dark when I finished packing. I put on my headlamp and started walking. I was treated to an absolutely gorgeous sunrise that went on forever. I watched the clouds turn rosy in giant wings extending away from the hidden sun. In the center, the sky turned pink and then golden. I walked and took pictures through one of the prettiest sunrises of my life. 
Jacob's Ladder, downhill through leaf piles, was a little tricky. I slipped and slid my way down hill. The hike up to Cheoah Bald took a long time. People keep saying how hard the Smokies terrain is, but I think this was harder. Descending to the NOC was no picnic either, though again I think that was the fault of the leaves. 
I got here after 5, so I'll have to stick around tomorrow until after the outfitter opens at 10. I've been getting up around 6. What on earth will I do with the time?  I can only eat so much breakfast. The restaurant doesn't open until 8, as well. Maybe I'll take a shower. The water was nice and hot and high pressure. Unfortunately they don't provide a towel. Drying off with my hand towel sized camp towel is doable but not fun or easy. 
I was planning on getting a motel room tonight, but they were booked. Instead I'm in the bunkhouse. I have it all to myself. I'm not convinced the heat really works. It's blowing but it isn't noticeably hot. I'm wondering if I need to sleep with my water filter. 
The NOC has had some major growth since I was last here. Good on them. I hardly recognized the place as I turned the corner on the trail and saw it. 
I bet the outfitter doesn't have honeybuns. I'll probably have to buy something disgustingly healthy to eat for breakfast until I get to Franklin.","

Hey guess who's solo in a shelter again? Every time somebody online says ""You'll never be alone on the AT"" I just want to shake them. 
The bunkhouse last night (where I was also solo, of course) was fine. I dillydallied until 8, dropped my keycard in the box, and walked down to the restaurant. Which was closed. Dammit. No hours listed on the door. Website still says they open at 8. I finally saw a small sign by the road that said they opened at 11. I didn't see it last night, not coming in by road. 
I took off my pack and set up on the bench near the door. That was as out of the wind as I could find. I needed my box from the outfitter, and I needed to buy snacks. So I couldn't just head into the woods. I made myself a mug of coffee on my jetboil and dug in my foodbag for something to eat. First thing out was the bag of marshmallows and they started some kind of feeding frenzy. I stuffed my face like a squirrel with nuts. 
I sat there for two hours, getting colder and colder. When my feet went numb, I got up and paced. Finally it was 10 and the outfitter opened. They were really nice. Didn't have a ton of snacks to buy, but they were nice. I decided to wait for the restaurant to open, and asked where I could sit out of the way in the shop. They got me a chair!
I ate a very nice burger and finally started walking around noon. I basically walked up hill all afternoon. It was fine. Clear blue skies and at times warm enough for shirt sleeves. Due to my late start, it was a very short hiking day. I hove up to the shelter at about 4:30. As usual nobody was here. I made dinner, hung my food, and filtered or boiled enough water for tomorrow morning. It's supposed to be chilly so I made a hot water bottle. My fuel bottle is running low, which is fine because I have a spare. 
My mail drop had the last guidebook pages so I made plans for the end of the trail. I'm pretty excited to see JD! Looks like reentry into the real world will take place after the weekend of December 8.","

My foot ached abominably during the night, especially when my other foot touched it. I had no idea how often my feet touched. Turns out it's ALL THE TIME. Other than that I slept well. My empty shelter issues have seriously dwindled. When I pried myself out of bed this morning, I was just grateful not to have others to contend with. I pushed my sleeping pad up against the back wall of the shelter and propped my clothes bag behind my back so that I could sit in comfort. 
The disgustingly healthy breakfast I got at the outfitter was $5 granola. It had pumpkin seeds in it, for goodness sake. It tasted fine and all, but l missed my $1 honeybun. 
I skipped the Wesser fire tower. It was cold enough at ground level without adding elevation and wind. The morning was very cold. I wore multiple layers of insulation. I wasn't able to ditch the gloves and windbreaker except for a period of maybe an hour at the warmest part of the day. Ribbons of ice pushed out of the ground were visible in shady spots the whole day. 
I considered the trees. When leaves were changing, I thought I might find bare trees depressing. But I like the light that comes through. I like being able to see the mountains around me without the leaves blocking my view. Rhododendrons are still green, as are some grasses and other ground hugging plants. So things aren't all just brown and grey. 
My foot was fairly painful today. Not sure why. I took a moment to ponder how difficult it would be to get rescued if I weren't able to put weight on my foot. So far it hasn't come to that, and I hope it never does. I'm frustrated that I never know when or why my foot is going to hurt more. Sometimes it barely hurts at all, but sometimes it brings tears to my eyes and curse words to my lips. 
My nose kind of hurts too. It's been pretty runny from the cold. Constant wiping has left it feeling chapped. The insides of my head feel raw too. I desperately hope that I'm not getting a cold. I had the raw head thing going on for a couple of days early in the hike, and it passed without blooming into a full fledged cold. I hope the same thing happens this time. I only have a about ten days left. I'm crossing my fingers that everything holds together for that long. 
Not *every* thing, though.. the hook disappeared off my other gaiter today. I looked down and it was flapping in the wind. I guess both of them will get tucked under shoelaces now. It looks stupid but works pretty well. 
I stopped a little early today, between the foot and the head. The shelter is empty but Dan showed up near dark and is tented nearby. This is the best of both worlds. I have company, but I don't have to worry about disturbing him in the morning. He's a musician and says he won't be getting up early. I think he's far enough away that unless I have some sort of stove flinging fit, he shouldn't hear my morning antics. I was especially grateful to see him since I'd seen no other humans today. Barely any vertebrates for that matter.","

I got up at 5:30, but I had some technical difficulties with breakfast. Actual hiking didn't commence until 7:20. I couldn't see the sun yet, but I could see it illuminating nearby mountains. In the red light of dawn they looked like dunes in the Sahara. 
It was still early when I reached the Wayah fire tower, which ironically burned last year. The summit had the worst fire damage I've seen anywhere on the trail. It made me a little sad to see all the blackened skeletons of the trees. But new plants have been started. In a few years it'll look great. 
Today I did actually see two hikers, briefly. They passed as I was filtering water while sitting in a sunny spot. Today, as it has been for a while, it was icy in the shade but warm in the sun. I was a little concerned about my water filter but I don't think its actually cold enough in the cold spots to cause problems, as long as I keep moving. 
At Newfound Gap I texted Zen of Gooder Grove, then sat to wait. A man drove up with his old dog, for the express purpose of letting her out to sniff around up there. I can't even tell you how much I loved this. Old dogs deserve this level of care, but not all of them get it. I mean all the dogs at my house do! But all dogs everywhere should, in my opinion. 
Zen picked me up and we headed back to the hostel, with a quick stop to pick up an afternoon snack. I got an egg roll and a couple of crab rangoons and I was very happy. I realize that a normal thruhiker would have gotten several entrees as their snack, but the normal ship sailed long ago. 
I grabbed a ride to the store with Rogue. She bought the makings of lasagna while I bought supplies for the next few days. When we got back I handed off my laundry and took a shower. I'm now wearing extremely fuzzy and soft hostel clothes, and I don't really want my regular clothes back. 
Once I was clean, I helped assemble the lasagna. Then we found out that the pan didn't actually fit into the oven. Oh my. Through extremely professional activities we managed to move the assembled lasagna into two smaller pans and slid them into the oven. Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.  I tried to contribute some money but Rogue said this was magic for me! I'm so touched. It means so much to me, especially magnified by how I've been wandering alone in the wilderness. Being showered by this kindness really stands out.","

I woke up at half past the hour all night to check my watch. Apparently I was very concerned about getting up in time for my shuttle. I have read that your sleep cycle should be 90 minutes, so does that mean I never got deep sleep? At any rate I felt fine when I finally got up at 6:30. The rest of the house was dark and quiet. I ate in my room and tried not to awaken the others.  Nobody but me and Zen really had a reason to be up early. Poor Zen wouldn't have either if I hadn't needed a ride. 
Zen dropped me off at Winding Stair Gap and I set off into one of the nicest mornings in a long time. My standards have changed. Right now all I need to have a great morning is for my extremities not to go numb. It started out cool, but the sky was clear and blue. Within a couple of hours I was hiking in long sleeves and loving life. 
The terrain was very gentle, with the trail slowly rising and falling through the hills. I paced along, not really noticing time passing. I love that flow state I can get into, where time is meaningless and I enjoy effortless concentration. This was one of those mornings. 
Around noon I stopped at Long Branch Shelter to eat a snack. Unfortunately the shelter reeked. I've smelled more pleasant privies. No idea what has happened there. I moved along. 
I was excited about Albert Mountain. I've taken a bad weather detour in two different years, but today the weather was perfect. I was surprised to find its famous rocks to be a non-event. The description had made it sound like a huge rock field with technical climbing involved. Instead, scattered along the trail were several rocks you had to step down. They weren't even slippery. I was almost down when I slipped on some damn leaves. I'm really starting to get a hate on for leaves. 
I hit my elbow and my pelvis on a couple of rocks. Not sure what I hit my noggin on, but I felt a little loopy. I waited a few seconds to verify that I hadn't broken any bones, then pushed myself back up to standing. My vision was distorted. Everything took on a nightmarish quality. My head ached at the base of my skull. 
My balance was okay. I started walking, staring at distorted shapes. My headache lasted a couple of hours. My vision cleared up within a few minutes, and my other dinged up areas stopped hurting after half an hour or so. It was disturbing but fortunately not serious. 
Once I recovered from my fall, my hike proceeded well again. I hiked through an area of severely burned rhododendron. The ground had burned down several inches. I noticed baby rhododendron sprouts sticking up from the bases of some of the plants. It's going to take that area a long time to recover. 
I was pleased to see two hikers at the shelter. They're good company. Starburst made a fire and shared his starbursts. He showed me how to roast them over the fire like marshmallows. They turn out warm and soft with a crunchy surface. They were delicious!
I was delighted to see Ghost Hiker again. She took some time off with family so I had gotten ahead of her on the trail. She almost never stays at shelters so I was lucky to see her tonight. It was great to hang out with her around the fire. 
We were all treated to an absolutely spectacular sunset tonight, and now there's a great big moon up in that clear sky.  Nature really pulled out all the stops today.  This is definitely one of my better days. I'm so happy.","

Sherpa informed me this morning that I had a funny snore. He didn't record it and his description was inadequate so I couldn't fully grasp it, but now I'm pretty curious. He also described petting a manatee (the manatee pretty much made him do it) and now I have a new life goal. 
My Jetboil was on a new canister this morning and it sounded like a freight train. I'm dubious about the whole ""they come from the same factory and just have different labels"" spiel. It sure sounded different, and the flame looked different too. More spread out. 
Ghost Hiker left before me. I forgot to say happy birthday, so if you read this, Ghost Hiker, ""Happy Birthday!""
After I started walking today it became clear that I had a little more damage from yesterday's fall. My right knee has been hyperextended. I put some tape on it but it didn't particularly help. It slowed me down and of course it hurt. It usually takes a few weeks to recover after I hyperextend it. I expect it'll hurt for the rest of the trip. With luck it won't hurt quite as much. 
I saw two gentlemen wearing safety vests today. One carried a walkie talkie. I didn't see any water bottles or other gear. I have no idea where they came from. I didn't see any cars at the road crossing. It will remain a mystery I suppose. 
It got cloudy and cold this afternoon. I bundled up and deployed my pack cover. It didn't really pour until I got to the shelter. I considered this excellent timing on my part. I got a little wet while fetching water, but it was still better than walking in pouring rain for an hour. 
I was here by myself for a couple of hours and was laughing at being solo yet again, but two section hikers arrived shortly before it got pitch black. It sure is nice to have company. I'm a little surprised that people section hike this time of year. When I go out in November and December closer to home, hikers are thin on the ground. But whatever the reason, I'm happy to have company two nights in a row. I might even see Ghost Hiker at the hostel tomorrow! We shall see. 
I had minimal cell signal today. I really wanted to a) get permission to send the picture of me in the back of the SUV at Newfound Gap to the Hiker Yearbook, and b) actually do so. I managed A but not B. Nor much else. Maybe tomorrow? Tomorrow is the deadline so it's then or never.","

The fog was thick in the shelter last night. I was distracted by the droplets moving in constantly changing shapes in my headlamp's beam. I'd blow my breath out to watch it whiten in a cloud in front of me. 
I'm easily amused. 
Today it was beautiful up in the mountains. At six the sky was clear and starry. The sun came up as I started walking. I could see the pillowy white tops of clouds settled down below me, as far as I could see. Clearly it was hella foggy down there. 
I saw lots of hikers today. They picked a nice day to get out there. I just chugged along, heading for town and hot food. Hot, delicious, cooked by someone else food. I got to the road at 3 and walked the half mile down to the hostel. Ghost Hiker was there! Bob got me a cola and showed me around. I took a quick shower and then headed into town in the hostel van. I wore scrubs since my clothes were in the laundry. 
We all went to a tavern for dinner. I wasn't too crazy about the recommended beer, but the burger was good. Then we walked over to the Ingles. I finally got my baguette and Brie! I'm very happy. 
I'm not sure if I want to zero here tomorrow or not. I guess I'll see. There isn't much point in rushing, since I have to meet JD on a specific day. I think I'll leave the decision for the morning.","

When I put my shoes on this morning it hurt like a SOB. I hissed and pulled my shoe off my bad foot. Detour, standing next to me, gave me a sympathetic grimace. I stood there on one foot for a bit, waiting for the pain to die down. That decided me on today's plan. I went and paid for another night. 
Everyone else drifted out eventually. I spent a pleasant day doing not very much. Crossword puzzles, reading, and Facebook. At lunchtime I made a hiker box meal. Knorr's Dirty Rice with some butter from the hiker fridge tasted pretty good. I ate the whole pot. Then I made a pancake the size of my head. It was an all carb meal, but it tasted good and I was pleasantly full. 
Ghost Hiker returned from her slack at 2 and decided to ask for a shuttle back out so she could sleep in the woods. The hostel was crowded last night and neither of us slept well. I think she would have been fine tonight but there was no way to know in advance. She offered me some food she had bought to eat for dinner tonight but wouldn't be using after all. I gratefully accepted, and was the happy consumer of pork and veggie egg rolls as well as an orange soda and a root beer. Then I remembered that I had Tate's Bake Shop chocolate chip cookies and so I had dessert as well. 
Joe arrived in late afternoon. He ate his dinner while I ate mine. We chatted, of course. He turned out to be a car guy. Sadly I couldn't give him many details of my own car guy's vehicles, but I showed him pictures and he could tell what they were. 
Joe was nursing a pissed off Achilles' tendon. I told him about kinesiotape and taped it up for him. He thinks it feels a bit better, but the proof will be in the walking tomorrow. I hope it feels good enough to let him complete his hike. 
My own hike will be complete shortly as well. The weather is supposed to turn, with temperatures plummeting. I expect to be a Joysicle the last day or two. I might be bundled up and looking like the Michelin Tire Man, but I'm going to do it!","

I had a heck of a time falling asleep. I think maybe I accidentally dosed myself with caffeine. I assumed the orange and root beer sodas were safe but maybe not. When I woke up I felt like pan fried hell. A day of rest was called for, but my back sure didn't appreciate it. Also? Severe bed head. 
Joe and I packed up and waited for it to be 7, when Bob opened up the breakfast. All you can eat sugar cereals is like a blast from the past for me. I still can't bring myself to eat Cocoa Crisps, but I enjoyed Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I had a whole lot of caffeinated beverage to help me deal with life. 
Bob dropped us off at Dick's Creek Gap and I headed off into the mist. It took an hour or so to hike above the clouds. The terrain is almost completely unfamiliar to me, hiked from this direction. Since I didn't remember it, it was like hiking new miles. Which is novel and cool. I saw a fair number of day hikers. They were all doing the 17 mile Unicoi to Dick's Creek section. More power to them. 
I sat on a log in the sun around noon at Addis Gap. With great happiness I finally ate the baguette and Brie I've been wanting for a while. Actually I ate a quarter of it. Baguettes are big. I enjoyed both the food and the act of lightening my pack. Not that it's that heavy. Most of the time, when it's correctly adjusted, I forget it's there. Even with all my additional winter gear. Have I told you about that? I can't remember. 
Summer gear: long sleeve pants and shirt, thin socks (2 pair), 40 degree bag, down jacket mostly used as pillow. Wool socks for sleeping. Also wool top and bottom for sleeping. Fleece hat. Alcohol stove. Fleece top. Windbreaker. Unused gloves. 
Winter gear: same daily outfit, but also a pair of thin wool socks, a pair of liner socks, and a pair of waterproof socks in case of snow or cold rain. I wear the windbreaker most of the time. I use the gloves much of the day. Still have the wool sleep gear, plus a second pair of synthetic tights. I wear my hiking shirt to bed, in addition to the wool layer and the fleece top. I layer the tights with the wool bottoms. I wear a down skirt in camp and in the sleeping bag. The sleeping bag is actually 2 - my summer quilt is layered inside my winter bag. I wear down booties over my socks. I have a down hood on over my wool buff and fleece hat. The down jacket is placed wherever I'm coldest. My fleece serape is my easy on, easy off layer during the day and my neck baffle at night to prevent drafts at my shoulders. I'm carrying my heavy, bulky Jetboil for quick, reliable hot water production. 
About 3/4 of my backpack is taken up with insulation. Totally worth it. I sleep super cold, so carrying enough gear to stay quite warm is a no brainer. 
I got to this shelter at about 3 and debated moving on to the cheese factory site as planned. But the advantages of bear cables and a privy drew me. I'll do a 15 mile day tomorrow to get to Low Gap. 11 miles sufficient unto today.","

My neighbors, Caroline and Julian, invited me to join them by their fire for a bit. I did, and had a nice time chatting and staring into the flames. Turns out they also plan to move to Colorado. Small world!
The moon was brilliant, clearly lighting the area so I could see easily. It made the night a little odd. Since it wasn't really dark, it didn't feel late. And when I woke up and checked my watch, I thought it would be 1 AM, but it was 5:30. Time to get up. So disappointing. 
I watched a beautiful sunrise as I packed up. I started walking with my headlamp but didn't really need it. The sunrise seemed to go on for a long time. I kept stopping to gawp. I don't know why I'm surprised that the cold weather sunrises and sunsets are so good. They seem like they should be a warm weather thing I guess. 
It was chilly all day, and windy. I spent much of the day bundled up. Really only in sun and out of wind was it comfortable in shirtsleeves, and I found precious little of that. That's all right. I can't expect a lot of warmth in December. I like it when I find it, but I don't expect much of it. 
I managed to get to Low Gap about half an hour before dark, so I had time to fetch water and make dinner before it got too dark. I found Wildflower and Gunn in residence along with their massive dog, Lillian. Lillian is currently snoring. Snoring dogs crack me up every time. 
My dinner was chicken tortilla soup flavor ramen. I'm not sure I would have guessed chicken tortilla flavor, but it tasted good. I must be pretty far gone if I'm digging the ramen. Next I'll find out that I like packets of tuna.
No, wait. That will never happen.

Well that was unpleasant. 
I checked my watch at 6 and was disappointed to see that it was time to get up. I could have happily slept another 3 hours. I got up and fetched my food bag. It wasn't raining, but it was misting hard enough to dampen my down coat. Dammit. I wiped it down as well as I could when I got back in the shelter. As quietly as I could I made breakfast - which means the shelter briefly roared as my Jetboil heated water for coffee. Wildflower, Gunn, and Lillian slept through it as well as they could. 
Right around sunrise I got underway. My outfit was a compromise. I could be comfortable uphill or downhill. I chose uphill, as overheating on uphills sucks and would mean an extra layer of wet garments to deal with. Wet garments that I couldn't later put on for warmth. So I wore my pants, wicking shirt, rain skirt, rain jacket, pole covers, and pack cover hoodie. As expected I was warm enough going uphill, but chilled on the flats and downhills. 
Shortly after I started, I walked toward what looked like my reflection: another woman with a blaze orange pack cover and hat, dark raincoat, and skirt. She stepped aside for me to pass. As I walked by I said ""We have a twin thing going on"" and she agreed. I wonder where she stayed last night. She must have tented somewhere, or started walking while it was still very dark out. 
Very quickly the fog turned to pea soup and stayed that way. I was on the ridgeline most of the day, which meant I was in the wind. The rain blew sideways. I was wet and cold. It was too cold to consider stopping for longer than a breath. I was miserable and spent my day wishing for it to end. Except for when the wind picked up enough that I was too scared of dead trees falling to be aware of the cold. But after that I was cold and miserable again. 
The wind was the kind that inflates your clothing so you look like one of those waving tube figures outside of a business. All that air inside my clothes accelerated the cooling process. Feh. 
When I finally arrived at Neel Gap, I was super happy to find the Outfitter open. I had more than half convinced myself that they would be closed, as they are listed as having unspecified different winter hours. Instead I walked in and had a hot drink right away, bought some food, and checked into the blessedly warm hostel. My day took a turn for the better. 
I ate my sandwich, took a hot shower, and then went back up to the store with the other hikers to buy pizza. We waited in front of the heater while the pizzas cooked, then adjourned to the hostel for our impromptu pizza party. It was nice to sit around and eat pizza. It was companionable. Also, pizza. 
My gear is mostly dried out, I have food and toilet paper, and there are 30 miles of trail left. Two 15 mile days and I'm done! Plus hiking out to a road, of course. The weather is supposed to be cold and windy but mostly clear. That's a vast improvement over today, so I expect I'll enjoy my final two days of thruhiking. And my half day of.. post-thruhiking? Day hiking? I don't know. Whatever it is, it'll be short and then I hope I will be somewhere warm.","

I didn't get a ton of sleep at the hostel, but I woke up feeling rested at 5 AM. I took my breakfast out to the common area. Joe came out to pack up for his ride to Atlanta. Hey Joe, if you read this I could not find your profile. Find me, my name is more unusual and should be easier to find. 
I waited around until it was light enough to see a little and then headed out. It was cold. My phone said it was 32 at Neel Gap, with a windchill of 20. I believe it. My fingers were going numb inside my gloves and pole covers. 
As I came around the corner and could get a good look at Blood Mountain, I saw fog rising up the mountain. I decided right then to take the Freeman Trail, which is the bad weather trail around the mountain. Yesterday's experience was too fresh in my mind to deliberately walk into bad weather, given another option. As it turned out, my hike on the Freeman Trail was the only time I really felt warm today so I was good with my decision. 
I regretted not wearing tights under my pants all day. It was too cold to stop for anything but the most urgent call of nature. The cold dulled my thirst and appetite, so that at the end of the day I found that I had barely drunk anything. Bad hiker! I know better, and I did sip occasionally, but not enough. I made a big hot dinner to get a bunch of fluids into me tonight. 
The land surrounding the trail was very pretty. I would have liked to linger and gaze, but I would have chilled too easily so I only snatched a few glances. I was forced to stop a moment and gaze in awe at some of the trees that were shredded by this year's hurricane. You think of trees being very solid and sturdy, but apparently healthy trees were ripped apart like it was child's play. Of course, many turned out to have been hollow inside. No surprise that those didn't survive a hurricane. 
Izzy and Detour showed up at the shelter tonight. They were pretty surprised to see me. I think it's funny that we'll summit the same day. Given how many times I've run into them, maybe it was inevitable. 
I feel like I should have some strong emotion about finishing. Maybe I will tomorrow. Right now I just feel glad to be almost done, and I'm looking forward to being warm.","

I luxuriated in the warmth of my sleeping bags and multiple down garments last night. The only part that wasn't completely warm was the tip of my nose. I sent home my sleeping hat a while ago in favor of my blaze orange fleece hat. While it is indeed very orange, it won't quite cover my nose at night. I have greatly enjoyed not getting shot, however. Joe told me about a hunter he met who told him he had just almost shot him, thinking Joe was a deer. That's some scary stuff. 
I started walking at 6:30, excited about my last day. As I walked I noticed a light in the woods off to the west. After I walked past, I heard a boom. Hunter I guess. Though I didn't think they hunted with headlamps. My own headlamp started to dim about then. This was disappointing, as the batteries were put in new yesterday. I understand that batteries die faster in cold weather, but this is ludicrous. The battery life indicator is red after something like an hour of use. This affected my plans for the day. I needed to be sure I set up camp early enough to do everything in the daylight, as the headlamp could die completely at any time. 
As the day moved on, my excitement level dropped. It felt like any other day of the hike. Walk up mountain. Walk down mountain. Repeat. I played leapfrog with Izzy and Detour for a while, finally losing them when I stopped in at Hawk Mountain Shelter for a snack and privy break. Army folks were all over and I was reluctant to drop trou with the possibility of a trainee hiding somewhere. Hence the privy was very welcome. 
As I walked I contemplated this thruhike. I'm happy to be completing it, fulfilling a longstanding dream. I don't really feel a sense of finality or completion. Maybe because I still have to hike tomorrow? Springer is the end, but there's nothing there but rocks and trees (and a shelter). Tomorrow I'll get up like on any normal trail day, make coffee, and hike about 8 miles. After the sun comes up, because see above about dead batteries. 
Maybe when I get home I'll have more insights, but probably not. I love hiking, but it's never provided me with much in the way of insight. Not like yoga teacher training did, for instance. Immersing myself in nature and motion and the hiker community for months is enjoyable.. and I guess that's as far as it goes. I feel like the same person. Maybe less negative? Having some distance between me and the rest of the world was emotionally restful. I liked not being very aware of the news cycle. I felt less anxious and less angry. In fact I was trying to remember the last time that I felt anger, and nothing is coming to mind. 
I enjoyed seeing the Three Forks area again. With its conifers and rhododendrons, it was the greenest place I've seen in a long time. Walking through it was very pleasant. 
Closer to the summit of Springer I met a few day hikers. None knew or asked if I were a thruhiker. One fellow asked if I were planning to camp up here, and wished a good time for me when I said I was. 
The summit was deserted when I got there. I took a picture of the rock, and tried to get a selfie with both my face and the plaque in it - with limited success. I contemplated the horizon for a few moments, then headed north back toward the shelter. I forgot to sign the register in the rock. Perhaps tomorrow. 
I was disappointed but not overly surprised to see the shelter empty. Izzy and Detour like to let things happen. Maybe they got here early and moved on down the approach trail. Maybe someone offered them a ride from the parking lot a mile back. Either way, congratulations, Izzy and Detour!
I made ramen and a hot Propel, boiled water for a hot water bottle, and tucked myself into my sleeping bag. It's supposed to be fairly cold tonight - low of 26, last time I was able to check the forecast. I expect I'll be quite comfortable. It's also supposed to rain or snow a little.  I'm not sure which I'd prefer. I suppose rain if it's only happening overnight, snow if I have to walk in it tomorrow. Rain at near freezing does not sound like a fun day. 
The shelter area is looking pretty rough. There is half burned wood scattered around, and two large pieces of plywood near the fire pit. I haven't visited the privy yet but I'm wondering if someone started disassembling it. Wherever the junk outside the shelter came from, it sure is unattractive. It doesn't affect my sleeping comfort but I don't think I'll use a picture of it to represent the end of my hike. 
In the morning I won't be a thruhiker anymore. Technically I'll be a dayhiker with a very large backpack. I'm not quite ready to shed the label and turn back into a functioning member of society yet, but I find myself looking forward to the challenges of the next year. I survived Maine. Everything else is a breeze.","

Technically Springer, as the terminus, was the end. But I didn't have any other option than getting up and hiking today. I'm counting it. For more official mileage, please refer to yesterday. 
Due to headlamp issues, I planned to sleep in. My body didn't cooperate. I tossed and turned. Finally at 6 I gave up. I put on my waterproof socks for the trek out to the bear box, as there was 1/2"" or so of snow on the ground. I dove back into my sleeping bag and made breakfast from there. I warmed the stove and fuel against me before lighting the stove, and it seemed a little happier. 
My guts have been a little weird the last couple of days. I'm not sure why. Maybe the ramen? I usually think of it as innocuous. Whatever the reason, I was grateful to be alone in the shelter as my butt trumpet rang out. (""Charge!"")
Since I was going to a motel, I had more clothing options. I would never normally wear my wool shirt during the day, as I needed it to be dry at night. But today it made a good layer under my raincoat. Warm when wet and less bulky and hot than my fleece top, it made a better layer for hiking in snow. 
I armored myself in every piece of rain gear I had. I put spares of gloves, socks, and bandana in the top of the pack. As I got ready, it started snowing again. The updated forecast called for 2-4"" of additional snow, not the original dusting. Just dandy. Time to walk. 
When I got back to the summit I remembered to leave a note this time. I tried to take a picture of the last white blaze, but I couldn't find it. It must be a fair distance from the summit. I shrugged and headed down the approach trail. 
I realized that I was happy. The snow was beautiful, I was hiking new trail, and being solo in winter conditions made me feel alive. I realized, thanks to the contrast, that I had felt melancholy yesterday. It had felt like an end of something. But today I felt happy about all the trails I haven't hiked yet, just waiting for me to find them. It was a good feeling. 
I stopped in at Black Gap Shelter to use the privy and take advantage of a roof. I wanted to listen to music and open a snack where I could do so without getting snow on things. Thus armored with tunes and calories, I continued. 
The snow came down thickly, making the walking more difficult. I set a goal for my day of no more than one fall per mile, and no broken bones. My stretch goal was no frostbite. I managed not to fall down, somehow. I'm stunned, myself. At one point I did deliberately sit and slide down a slope I couldn't safely traverse, but I never fell. I went flying dozens of times, but always managed to catch myself. 
The only tracks I saw were mine and some bunnies'. I took the approach trail rather than the Len Foote trail because I figured it would be better traveled, but I guessed wrong. I was the only one plowing through the snow today. I couldn't measure it, but it came partway up my shin on Frosty Mountain. I found it slightly easier to shuffle through it, kicking my feet under it to the ground, than to step down through it and compress the snow. At first I scanned the ground carefully, looking for rocks. Once it got deep, that was useless. It was a relief to give up staring at the snow, but I didn't enjoy the surprise flight through the air every time my foot found a rock. In steep parts I slid, nearly skiing. It was a fast way down the mountain, I'll say that for it. I decided I was super, super happy to be headed out of the mountains. People who thruhike in winter baffle me. 
Once I was 2 miles from the lodge, I started mentally counting down tenths of a mile. At about 1 mile, I came upon footprints. Shortly I found a hiker who was clearly not interested in company. And not much longer after that I was thrilled to start seeing signs for the lodge. Civilization! Hot water! Cheeseburgers! All I ate during my walk today was some trail mix so I was starving. 
At the lodge I dripped in front of the counter as I checked in. The clerk recognized me as a thruhiker and congratulated me. It was nice to have an in person acknowledgement. I had only seen that one hiker since I summited, and we didn't chat. I had told JD and Goddess and Facebook yesterday, but I find that a person in front of me feels different. 
I dropped off my gear in my room, dressed as dry and non-smelly as I could, and headed to the restaurant. I was the only one there. I ate my cheeseburger in front of the giant glass wall looking out on the snow. The snow stopped, revealing a pretty frosted countryside, then started up again. Georgia doesn't get much snow. This must seem apocalyptic to them. 
Back in my room, I arranged things to dry. I had de-snowed things immediately upon arrival of course. But now I turned up the heat and spread out wet garments. And my shoes. I hate having to put them back on soaking wet, but I have no spares. At least they dry faster than boots. 
I took a long, hot shower. I mean frog boiling hot. And I turned up the room heat until it was uncomfortably warm. I've been dreaming of being warm. The high temps have been around 40, and much lower with wind chill. The only time I haven't been cold was in my sleeping bag. JD is probably not going to be thrilled with how hot I have it, but I'm luxuriating.","
