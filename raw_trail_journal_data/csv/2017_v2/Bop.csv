Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556694,"Well, we've been buried in 16 inches of snow from a Nor'easter here in upstate New York. It's put a bit of a crimp in my final training hikes, but given me a good excuse for relaxing and trying to get my affairs in order before I hit the trail in another 11 days. Hopefully the relatively warm GA weather around Amicalola will continue, and I won't have to cope with snow on the trail.I've put together a tentative hike plan, gathered and tested my new gear and clothing, and bought all my food and beverage mix for mail drops along the way. Just need to box it and my seasonal clothing up, and put together a list of possible shipping addresses for motels or hostels where where I might crash when in town. My wife is our official post master and will ship them out.For anyone interested, my major gear consists of: OBOZ Sawtooth mid boots, ULA Circuit pack, Enlightened Equipment Revelation 20 degree down quilt, Z-Packs Haxamid Solo Plus tent, Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork poles, Jetboil Minimo cooking system, Thermarest Neoair mattress, and a variety of outwear from Outdoor Research, Eddie Bauer, and L.L. Bean. I'll rate the gear at the end of my hike. My next post should be from the trail - wish me luck and good weather!",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Fri",0
Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557128,"Here on the edges of the Adirondacks we are still facing winter. However, in Georgia they're now facing record heat. I think I'd like to be warm. I'm in the final throes of packing, and expect to be ready to begin our drive on Sunday to Springer Mountain.   This past weekend, our daughter and her family came to ski, and to wish me best of luck on the trail. To remind me of this luck, they left me a small horseshoe to take with me. I feel I'm blessed. I have the backing of my wife, my daughter and her family, and many friends who are all excited for my journey and wishing me the best. I must admit, I'm starting to get nervous. The date is fast approaching, and I was never sure whether it would ever really arrive. I can't believe I finally have the chance to experience one of my bucket list wishes. In many ways I feel I've been blessed. I've had a great career, a wonderful wife and family, a chance to work with various charities to assist them in their growth, and now, a chance to finally hike the trail and learn a bit about myself along the way. But, beneath it all, I'm starting to really feel nervous. This is such a major undertaking, and so different from anything I've done in the past. I'm getting up there in years, and I've had open heart surgery, back surgery, and, while serving in the Army, developed ulcerative colitis which required major abdominal surgery. So, I'm facing over 2200 miles of hiking over rugged terrain, with a slightly used body.I guess if I can do it anyone can, and maybe that's the greatest benefit of my hike, to help other see that you can overcome your own limitations, and still achieve your dreams, even though they may seem out of reach of the time. Well, that's about it for now. I'll update you all when I actually leave for Amicalola, and wish you the best till then.",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Tue",0

I'm sure the down puffy will prove useful during late nights in the mountains, but I'm glad I also have a t-shirt and convertible pants to help cover the temp swings. I just spoke with an old friend from my motorcycling days, who moved from MA to VA a decade or more ago. He told me there seems to be a lot of rattlers out early this year, and to ""keep my eyes open, and don't try to play with them"". Seems like sound advice! I'm hoping to hook up with him and his wife in Buena Vista VA in late May. Tomorrow we'll head for Gainesville for last minute provisioning and a nice dinner before heading for Amicalola on Monday.

However, the views are non-existant. We are really fogged in, with heavy storms forecast for tomorrow, my first trail day. West of us, in Texas and Louisiana, they are having softball-sized hail, and tornados. We expect a portion of that storm to move through this area tomorrow, with clearing skies tomorrow night. Speaking of the trail, I reigstered at the visitor's center here at the park, one of around 40 North Bound, or NOBO, hikers starting out each day from here, headed north. I'm officially hiker 1294 of this year's NOBO class.   Hoping I'll be among the 10% or so of the registered thru hikers to stand atop Katahdin later this fall. Tomorrow's the big day, storm or no storm. My wife Dawn is planning to hike with me from the trailhead to the plaque atop Springer that marks the southern terminus of the trail. There, we'll get a photo, say what will probaly be teary goodbyes, and I'll head north into the wilds of Georgia. Happy Trails, Op",,Fogged in at Amicalola,"Mar 27, Mon",0
Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558071,"My wife joined me for the 2 mile round trip from the trailhead to the plaque atop Springer. Along the way, we met Kansas and Whiskey Mike. The day proved partly cloudy, the rhodadendrum groves were 12 feet of lushness (although not yet in bloom), and the streams were running well. Whiskey and I hiked part of the way together to Stover Creek Shelter where we had lunch. Whiskey Mike decided to take a break, and so Kansas and I hiked to the Hawk Mountain Campsite together, getting in around 5:30. Tents were set, dinner eaten and water refilled. The campsite is lovely, new, and well equiped with several bear boxes and a privy. The hike down to the campsite was rather lengthly at .2 miles or so, and steep, and it was another 0.2 mile downhill walk from there for water. The water, once reached, was running well. Be aware that the army ranger training brigade was active in the area. Machine gun fire and explosions continued till around 9PM. Tomorrow I'm heading for the Justus Creek Campsites at mile 14.4.

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558078,"Today was rough. I was up early and on the trail before 8AM. Just north of the Hawk Mountain Campsite there is a great stream for resupply. I stopped at Hawk Mountain Shelter to sign the log and make some hot cocoa. The day was sunny and warm, and I was stiff from yesterday's hike, and I had been awoken several times last night due to leg cramps. I should have listened to my body. I've been hiking slowly due to torn tendons in my left foot, so I'm only averaging a mile an hour. As a young soldier, I developed a serious intestinal illness that resulted in the loss of my large intestine. As a result, I suffer from chronic dehydration, and today was the perfect storm. I sweat heavily at the best of times, and today was warm and humid. I'm moving slowly because of the tendon, so it's longer between water stops. So I became very dehydrated. My legs were very stiff and cramping whenever I stopped for a break. When I'd stand up after a break, my vision would go black. There is no place to refill water bottles between Hawk Mountain and an undocumented military water trailer at Cooper gap. So, by the time I was coming back down off Sassafras Mountain, I was out of water, my legs were spasming, and I couldn't eat anything because I had no saliva. Not a good situation. My wife picked me up at Cooper Gap. I'll take a day off, regroup, get myself hydrated (it takes me 24-36 hours to do so), and I'll go to Mountain Crossings to see if I can lighten my pack enough to carry additional water in a bladder.   I'm hoping to get back on the trail by the day after tomorrow.","Hawk Mountain Campsite

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558243,"Well, I'm back lumbering along the trail. After spending nearly 40 hours getting rehydrated, stretching, and removing some items from my pack to reduce weight so I can carry more water, I got back on the trail where I had left it two days ago, at Cooper Gap. Today I slack packed. I carried only my water, emergency supplies, and food other than breakfast and dinner. This brought my pack weight way down, so I could hike easier and faster, covering 8.3 miles in 6.5 hours. Not fast, but faster than the 1MPH I had been averaging. The weather was also much cooler today day, with bright sun and the residual clouds from last night's storm. All the creeks were running, and water was easy to find.   My wife Dawn hiked in from Woody Gap, so I could hike my last 1.5 miles today with her. Tonight is my last night in the hotel with Dawn. Tomorrow, she will drop me at Woody Gap, and start her long solo drive home. I'm losing my local support, and will miss her terribly. I have two tough days coming up, culminating with the appropriately named Blood Mountain. I hope to take a partial day off at Mountain Crossings at Neal's Gap, a store and hostel at the foot of Blood Mountain, where I will resupply. Happy trails,","Cooper Gap
",Woody Gap,"Mar 31, Fri",7.30
Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558583,"Today I said good bye to my wife, Dawn, knowing I was now committed, since she had to return home to New York, our dog, and her store. I climbed up out of Woody Gap with tears in my eyes. I stopped for water at a lovely trailside waterfall just north of Lance Creek. I was planning to stop at Woods Hole shelter for the night, but still had energy, so I decided to push on over Blood Mountain to Neal's Gap. This would be my longest, and toughest, hike to date. The Hike over the 4457' high Blood is tough. At a break part way up, I noticed I'd lost my wide mouth 1 litre Nalgene bottle. I had taken a brief spill earlier, and assume it slipped out then. I let the ridge runner know, should someone find it, that it belonged to Bop, and that I would be at Neal's for the night. I got to Mountain Crossings about 5:30, just in time for a pizza and Coke, before they closed at 6. I ended up giving away half the pizza to other hikers, then headed up to the tentsite for some well deserved rest. Happy Trails,","Woody Gap

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558579,"Had a rather rough night. I spent the night tenting just behind Mountain Crossings, and didn't sleep well. It was blowing hard, cold, and the tentsite sloped. The Cuban fibre pan in my tent is about as slippery as ice, so my mattress pad took a bobsled run to the low end of the tent every half hour, at which point I'd have to roll off the pad in the cold, and slide it back uphill. I think I got 1-2 hours sleep. After packing up, I hit Mountain Crossings, where I had a pack fitting session, bought a new 1 litre Nalgene to replace the one lost yesterday, and went through the supply box my wife had dropped off for me a few days earlier. I ended up bouncing most of that box forward to the Top of Georgia Hostel, where I'll be staying in a few days. I also bit the bullet, and bought a new Big Agnes Fly Creek HV 2 Person tent, shipping my old tent home. It added a pound to my pack weight, so let's hope it is worth it. Then I hit the trail for Hogpen Gap. At Tesnatee Gap, just as I was facing the really steep climb up Wildcat Mountain (500 feet elevation gain in less then half a trail mile), and feeling sorry for myself, since the trail angel who had been there passing out Mountain Dew, had pulled out just as I descended, in pulls two new angels with chips and beer. Yippee!After carbo loading , I made it up Wildcat, and on to Hogpen. Got my new tent set up, water filtered, dinner, and a sponge bath in (it's really bad when you can't stand your own smell). Bad weather is headed our way, so I think I'll do a zero in Blairsville tomorrow, if I can find a ride. Happy Trails!","Neal's Gap

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558578,"A new trail friend, Paul, and I flagged down a ride early this morning from Hogpen Gap, where we'd spent the night with around 15 other hikers. Kansas was there as well. Last night I tried out my new Big Agnes Fly Creek HV 2 tent. Much roomier and comfortable than my old cuban fibre bare bones tent. So, why did we leave the trail and backtrack to The Holiday Inn at Blairsville, you may ask. Simply, a STORM. Not just any old storm, but a real life threatening event. Winds are forecasted to reach 100 MPH, with damaging hail and tornados likely. 10 of last night's group were planning to make a run to the next shelter, about 4 miles away. I imagine that shelter, Low Gap (that sleeps 7) will see 25-30 bodies trying to find refuge from the storm tonight. I hope they all make it through safely. We were lucky this morning. Another hiker had arranged a shuttle into Blaisville from our campsite for 7:30 this morning. Paul and I were to accompany her, but were about 2 minutes behind her as she hiked up to the road. The shuttle didn't wait, so we were stranded in pea soup fog and rain at the side of the road. I tried calling shuttle services to no avail, when, out of the fog appeared a father in a pickup truck, looking for the nearby invisible parking lot, to pick up his son and his son's fellow hiker. So, we had a comfortable ride right to our hotel, where we were immediatly checked in, in time for continental breakfast. A subsequent shower and clothes wash in the tub, and I'm starting to feel human. Paul and I are hoping to head back to Hogpen tomorrow mid day, depending on weather. Happy Trails!","Hogpen Gap

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558922,"Paul's wife got up early to shuttle us back to Hogpen Gap from which we had left yesterday to take shelter in a hotel under threat of a damaging storm. The weather this morning was great for hiking: sunny, cool, dry, and breezy. We made good time, hoping to make Unicoi Gap before another round of forecasted storms hit. Along the way, we stopped at Low Gap Shelter for water, and the wildflowers were in bloom along the stream banks. Given the severity of last night's storm, I imagine the shelter must have been packed tbe previous night with worried hikers.   Throughout the afternoon we passed trailside waterfalls and rushing streams swelled by last night's storm. Unfortunately, our energy and the daylight wained as we were about 3.5 miles fom our goal. I was running low on water, and so filtered 4 liters from a stream. Immediately after the stream we found a good tenting site, and met Josh, an IT data analyst, who is section hiking to prepare for an upcoming sporting event. Tomorrow, we'll need to hit the trail early to beat the next storms arrival, forecast for 8 AM.","Hogpen Gap

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558927,"Early this morning, Paul, Josh, and I broke camp and started a fast hike to Unicoi Gap. Once more, another dangerous storm is forecast, with hail, high winds, possible tornados, flooding, and lightening....pretty much armagedon but without the plagues. The storm was to start around 8 AM, and we didn't want to be out on an exposed ridge in its fury. Paul and I left first, knowing the younger, and more fit, Josh would quickly overtake us. Paul stopped for water just as Josh caught us. Josh and I continued on together hiking as fast as I could. Paul had planned to finish his hike at Unicoi, so he could return to work, and his wife was to pick him up mid-morning at the parking lot in the gap. Josh and I needed to arrange a hotel room in Hiawassee Georgia to split, and a shuttle service to get us there from the gap. Unfortunately, we started out later than we should have, so I found myself on that dreaded exposed ridge, using my cell phone to make arrangements. Lightening was dancing on the surrounding peaks, the rain was beginning, gusty winds were using our packs for sails, and I was having little luck, with nearly all available rooms taken. I eventually booked one of the last (read expensive) rooms and a local shuttle company. As I made these arrangements, Kansas caught up with us. He informed me he has adopted a new trail name: Cowboy. The trip down the final mountain into the gap was steep, wet, and slippery, with many rock scrambles and areas where the preceeding storm had washed leaves onto the trail (hiding roots and rocks), and turning the Georgia clay into slick puddles of red. When we finally made it down, we found someone had vandalized five cars in the parking lot the previous evening. So, Paul met his wife and is headed home. Cowboy is in a hotel in Helen GA, and Josh and I are splitting a room in Hiawassee. The weather ""experts"" are forecasting another major storm for tonight and tomorrow morning, at which time the temperature is to drop precipitously, and the trail ahead of us will see freezing temps, snow, and 40 MPH winds... Can you say blizzard? Most of the hikers here in our hotel plan to stay through tomorrow night. Time, and the weather, will tell. Happy Trails!","Tentsite near Blue Mountain Shelter
",Hiawassee Hotel,"Apr 05, Wed",3.50
Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558970,"Another day of rain and potential snow tonight has caused Josh and I to spend today and tonight off the trail (or perhaps it's just plain old laziness). So, I thought I'd use today's journal entry to discuss my experiences on the trail and provide some overview of hiking the trail.There are several great guide books for hiking the trail, as well as cell phone apps. These contain maps of the trail, elevations, locations of shelters, tentsites, side trails, water, access trails and parking lots, roads, and nearby towns. However, I've been amazed at the number of undocumented stealth, or unofficial, tentsites I've seen on the trail, many of them level, near water or with views, and with fire rings, and logs for seating.Speaking of views - they are few and far between. This early in the season, the trees are yet to leaf out, and yet there are few opportunities for spacious views. You trudge through a tunnel of tall leafless hardwoods. The trail itself is a dirt path, with roots, loose stones, rocks, boulders, branches, puddles, and downed branches to make it interesting. As a result, your eyes are focused on the next six feet, for a misstep could result in a fall or sprain, either of which could end your hike. Thus, it is unlikely you would see many views, where they available.The trail is marked with white blazes, white stripes painted on trees, boulders, buildings, and posts, as well as small wood and/or bronze plaques at intersections or notable points. Blue blazes are used to mark other intersecting trails, side trails to shelters, tentsites, water supplies, privies, parking and access trails, and loops on the AT to circumvent especially difficult terrain. Since your eyes are fixed on the trail immediately in front of you, the site of a white blaze brings relief. In some areas, heavy rain is diverted off the trail and creates what appears to be a trail of its own. So, at the end of the day, when you're tired and the light is fading, you need to pay careful attention to the trail marks.On the trail, your pack is your home. It contains your house (tent and ground cloth), your bedroom (mattress pad, sleeping bag, and inflatable pillow), your closet and clothes, your kitchen (stove, pots, and utensils), your pantry (food and bag for bear bagging - hanging your food from a tree out of reach of your furry mooching neighbors), your medicine cabinet, tool chest for repairs, your lighting, your phone (cell phone and battery pack for recharging),and your water (including water filtration system to remove sediment and bacteria/viruses from fresh water sources such as streams and ponds).Packs are heavy, and, due to some freak of gravity, become heavier as the day wears on. Mine, fully loaded with three days of food and water, is under 30 pounds, yet, after 8 hours of carrying it up and down rugged terrain, seems more like 50. The key is to carry the minimum load you need to be safe and comfortable, and to have the pack correctly adjusted so most of the weight is carried by your hip belt, and thus your hips, rather than your shoulders.Shelters are spaced every 8 or so miles on the trail. They are usually three sided with an open front, sloped roof, and with wooden sleeping platforms. They range from 1-3 floors and sleep 5-14 people. Water and a privy are usually close by, and many have picnic tables, and fire rings. Tentsites are more basic. Just flat spots with fire rings, and, if you are lucky, water nearby and a log to sit on. Thus far, I've not used a shelter. When I started my hike, there were 40+ others starting each day. Given the rate at which most people hike, there are usually 2 shelters for each day's worth of hikers. So, there is going to be a major shortage of bunk space. I like my tent. It is quieter, fully enclosed so there are neither bugs nor the mice that commonly inhabit the shelters, and I am older, and so tend to be beat at the end of my day. I just want to set up, eat, refresh my water supply, do a quick clean up, and crawl in by sleeping bag. Many of the younger shelter residents want to talk, joke, drink, smoke, etc. So, I leave the shelters to them. The other advantage is I can pitch my tent nearly anywhere, and I've seldom hiked a mile without seeing a tentsite of some type. So, when I've run out of energy, I don't need to walk that additional few miles to a shelter.
That's it for today. Hopefully I'll be back on the trail tomorrow.

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559291,"Josh, I, and two others who had taken a zero yesterday at the Holiday Inn in Hiawassee, got a shuttle back to Unicoi Gap. The morning was fridgid, with high winds (up to 40MPH). The others were off like jets, while I maintained my stately pace. Several tress were down from the storm, and the water sources were flowing well. I perspire heavily, and at one point, I took off my glasses and put them in one of my cargo pants pockets along with my cell phone. Big mistake. I regularly take out my cell to snap photos and to check distances to water and campsites. Somewhere along the way, I lost my glassees. Tray Mountain was a challenge. It is tall, steep, and there was still snow in the shady area beneath bushes. Half way up I encountered trail magic again. A group from Alabama had set up camp, and were serving home made bisquits cooked over an open fire, sausages, cookies, eggs, and coffee! I met up with Cowboy again, and we hiked together to Sassafras Gap, where we set up camp along with five others. The night was very cold, so I wore my woolen long underwear, wool cap, fleece gloves, woolen socks, pants, long sleeve shirt, and down fluffy (jacket) to bed. I was toasty, but my aging hips really felt the cold seeping up from the ground through my inflatable mattress. It felt like a toothache in my hips. Hope tomorrow warms up.

First, to keep warm, and second, to reach the Top of Georgia Hostel in time to get a bunk before they were all gone. I moved right along, aand covered the 6.3 trail miles, and another 0.5 road miles to the hostel in about 4.5 hours.

The only thing I noted, was their foam mattresses had seen better days. If you plan to bunk there, lay your mattress over theirs. The whole tenor of the trail changed coming up out of Dick's Gap. Last year's forest fire dominated the trail. Everywhere you looked the leaf carpet had burned, scorching tree trunks up about a foot, burning downed trees and small bushes, and leaving the aroma of an old wood stove, and black ash on you whenever you sat or brushed up against something.

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559892,"Today I considered quitting for the first time. I had injured my left foot last fall, and have dealt with mild continuous pain since then. Today I stepped on an edged stone right at the same location as the old injury, and the pain was serious. I began to compensate for the reawakened injury by increasing my reliance on my right leg and foot, resulting in a sore knee and leg cramps in my right leg. On top of that, I developed poison oak in my groin, probably from a midnight bathroom break. Embarassing, and uncomfortable when walking. Even though this is the driest year on record in this area, recent storms have left streams flowing...good for those of us who rely on them for our water. Unlike your tap water, we need to filter our water before consumption. Particles such as sand, decomposing leaves and other sediment obviously needs to be removed, but so do much smaller ans more troublesome particles, including bacteria and viruses. The most common water filters use ceramic filters through which you push water. I have a two stage filter. I first filter water through a fine plastic mesh to remove most particulates, and then use intense UV light to scramble the viruses and bacteria. Thus far, this solution from Steripen seems to be working well. Hikers are always facing trade-offs. Do I filter and carry more water letting me hike further without stopping, and lessoning the risk of running out? Or do I carry less, saving around two pounds per quart? It also depends on how frequent the water sources are encountered, and the likelihood they are flowing. For now, it seems there is water everywhere. Happy Trails!","Bly Gap

Betty Creek Gap is a long 12.3 miles away, with only Standing Indian Mountain standing in my way at 5435 feet tall. For some reason, my choice of tent sites always presents me with these tough climbs first thing in the morning. As any senior knows, we tend to wake up a bit slower, our joints are a bit stiffer, and our muscles are in revolt mornings after a previous day of brisk exercise. Makes these early morning challenges interesting. There are few views, and, since I was pushing hard, I didn't shoot any photos. Cowboy and I leapfrogged each other all day, and I came across a charming couple from CT who were hiking the trail for 18 days. Between them, they'd seen around 145 years, and she a hip replacement. I found them inspirational. Made it to my goal late in the day, and rushed to get camp set up and a meal in me.

One of the young ladies in our bubble (group of hikers who hike aat about the same speed and so bump into one another often) told me there were wildfires just north of us that had closed five miles of the trail north of Winding Stair Gap. Apparently, they are shuttling hikers beyond this section from Franklin. My foot and knee are worse today. I'm going to have to get off the trail for a couple of days and give them some rest and healing time. I have packages awaiting me at the Budget Inn, a hiker hotel in Franklin. I just need to make it there. As if God heard me, I came across a trail angel within a half hour, serving muffins, coffee, juice and fruit. Then we headed up our toughest climb to date, Albert Mountain at 5250 feet. The last 4-500 yards were so steep that in places I could place my hand on the trail in front of me without bending. It was just short of technical rock climbing. Making it to the top rewarded me with magnificent views from the fire tower. The hike down was very easy, a long gradual descent over 3.5 miles. Along the way, I crossed the 100 mile mark, and met my first fellow NY hiker when I offered to take his photo next to the mile marker.   Later, a hiker informed Cowboy and I that a shuttle was picking people up from Rock Gap (the last gap before my destination) and taking them to Franklin. So we all hustled and made the gap in time. Due to the fire, and the bubble of stalled hikers it created in Franklin, I couldn't get a room at the Budget Inn, and so stayed at the much more expensive Quality Inn.   Took a half hour shower to get the dirt, perspiration, and ash off. Laundered all my clothes and cleaned most of my gear.   Then walked a block to Willy's where I had a memorable bar-b-que dinner. Got a room at the Budget Inn for the next two nights.

Hikers typically have a choice of sleeping accommodations. On the trail, we choose between tenting and shelters. Since I like my privacy, and hate dealing with bugs and snakes, I've stuck with tenting. Occasionally a hostel, like the Top of Georgia Hostel I stayed at a few days ago, is a wonderful change. They are simple bunkrooms, often with 6-10 bunk beds per room, a shared bath, laundry, and some form of kitchen. Prices vary between $20-30 per person per night. Hiker hotels are a step up. They are similar to most other hotels, but are priced more reasonably ($40-50 per night with $5 per additional hiker) and are usually shop worn, since hikers, by ""trade"" are rather dirty and smelly, their packs, boots, and poles tend to wear heavily on carpet and furniture, many hikers are young and want to party when in town, hikers often share rooms to save money resulting in even more wear and tear, and we clean our filthy clothes and gear in bathrooms and sinks, leaving a lot of dirt and stained towels. In trail towns like Franklin, much of the economy depends on hikers. There are three outfitters here in town, and four or five motels/hostels catering to hikers. Tonight I stopped by a bar, something I seldom do, for a margarita. A pleasant older woman bought my drink, and those of the other two hikers at the bar, as her way of thanking hikers for their financial support of the local businesses. Tomorrow, I'm going to try a short 3.7 mile slack pack. Slack packing means hiking with a minimal or no pack. Some hostels ans hiker hotels will drop you off on the trail at one spot, and pick you up later at another spot down trail. The hiker gets to hike light and fast, and the motel gets them for another night. This will allow me to see how my foot responds to a day off. Hopefully I'll be back on the trail once more for real the next day.

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560045,"This is a tough journal entry for me to write. I had injured my left foot and ankle on a training hike last September. X-rays and CAT scans showed no broken bones or obvious tendon/ligament damage. However, months of rehab had not restored either strength or mobility. Dawn and I knew I was taking a bet on whether it would hold up to the rigors of hiking the AT. This past week, the foot pain I had been experiencing for months (similar to a nagging headache) began to increase, and the ankle would roll to the outside when I stepped on uneven ground. As a result, my right leg began to suffer as my body tried to compensate. 
I took two days here in Franklin to rest the left foot and right knee, and to test their recovery on a short 3.7 mile hike with a light pack this morning. Unfortunately, in the the course of less than two hours, my left ankle partially rolled four times. Each time I was able to quickly shift my weight to my right leg, and to catch myself using my trekking poles. But, the risk of a major fall is just too great, and the risk of a major sprain occurring on a remote section of the trail too daunting to continue. 
So, this will be my last post for a while. I'm trying to arrange transportation home, and will try to find a specialist who can help me address this weakness, so that I can hopefully continue my hike later this year. I want to thank all of you who have been following my journey, and can only hope to see it resumed before long so that I can continue to share my experiences on the trail. 
Happy Easter, and God Bless you all!","Franklin NC

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561372,"Anyone who knows me, knows I am persistent. Not necessarily smart, but persistent. I had returned home from Franklin NC due to a foot/ankle injury. After meeting with my doctor, I was referred to an orthopedics doctor who specializes in this type of injury. Unfortunately, my appointment with him is not until the 4th of May. Since I didn't want to lose another 2+ weeks of hiking, I prevailed upon my poor wife to drive me to Delaware Water Gap on the PA/NJ border. Since New Jersey looked relatively flat, I assumed it would be easy to hike across the state and have her pick me up near New York City in time for my appointment. So, yesterday, Thursday the 20th, we drove down and spent the night at the Pocono Inn in Delaware Water Gap, a nice motel that is currently undergoing a complete upgrade, and splurged on a very nice dinner at the Sycamore Grill.This morning, Dawn drove me to the trail, which winds through the downtown, and then crosses the Delaware River on a major interstate bridge. Then, she drove to the High Point State Park in NY to drop off a box of supplies for me to pick up when I hiked through.
Well,I was partially correct; New Jersey is relatively flat. However, an easy hike it is NOT. At least not for someone with a very sore foot. It seems the rocky trails that PA is so known for have decided to expand into NJ. Today started out with light rain, and thick fog. Even so, the start of the trail was breathtaking, winding along a lovely cascading stream with several waterfalls and mossy boulders. Now, I'm sure there is soil in New Jersey. After all, it is the Garden State. However, in the first 10+ miles of the trail, my poor left foot seldom touched any. Rather, as the image above shows, the trail is rocky. Some are small round stones, while most are larger shards and small boulders. There were so many stones, that at several trail locations, hikers had built the stone cairns shown above.
Of all the trail types I could have chosen, perhaps none other would have been so hard on my foot. Each step on this terrain causes the foot to flex and twist. By mile 5 I was hurting, and by mile 7 I knew my hike was done. I called poor Dawn, who, by now, had driven nearly 3 hours toward home, and was within 20 miles of our house, to ask her to come back down and pick me up. I pushed on another 3+ miles to the lovely Mohican Outdoor Center, where I grabbed a sandwich and soda while I waited for her. The Center is a great place - gourmet food served in a communal setting, a library, outfitter store, fireplace and sofas, a deli, and several cabins. Dawn arrived around 7:15PM, and we started our nearly 4 hour drive home.
So, I fear I am off the trail until the foot issues can be addressed. It may be that my trip is postponed until 2018 to allow adequate time to heal. However, this is not the end - it is just the beginning. Persistent indeed!

Bop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563732,"Well, I met with the orthopedic specialist last week and his diagnosis is both good and bad. On the good side, my left foot will not require surgery.  On the bad side, I'm going to have to limit any walking for several months, so my 2017 thru-hike attempt is a bust.  It appears I tore ligaments in a joint in the left mid-foot (on the outside of the arch) last September during a training hike.  As I began my thru-hike attempt this past March, and the miles piled up, I gradually re-injured the same weakened joint.  The only viable treatment is to use a custom insole in my left shoe to support my weight on the inner-arch area instead of along the injured outside of my foot, and to limit my walking, so the ligaments have time to heal.  These injuries are slow to heal, and, at 62 years of age, mine will probably require the rest of the year.
Thus, it appears my thru-hike attempt will have to wait till 2018.  This will probably be my last post till I resume my hike in 2018, and I hope you'll check back then, when old Bop gives it another shot. For now, I'll leave you with a photo of my favorite hiking buddy (my dog Ginger) and me, taken last September atop nearby Buck Mountain in the Adirondacks, a few days before I injured my foot.
