Intrepid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/475591,"Due to having come down with the dreaded Shingles, I've had to reconsider whether I will be able to hike next spring. Medically/physically I feel I would be OK to do it, even though this condition has now lasted over 3 months and left some scarring on my right eye. It's just that I've had to dip into my ""Trail Account"" in order to pay some of the medical expenses, for which my insurance left me holding the bag!","

Intrepid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/475592,"I'm disappointed that I won't be able to do the trail, and mentally, I'm actually annoyed that I will have to wait another year. But, it should, hopefully, be for the better. I will have an entire year to save even more than I was planning. I attempted my first thru-hike in 2012, and am fairly certain about how much money it should take me next time around! So, if I can only get to the other side of working through another year, and I can make it to 2016, I will definitely be ready to go (again)!","
