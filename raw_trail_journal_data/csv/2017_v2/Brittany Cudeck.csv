Brittany Cudeck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570892,"So, today is the day. As I said goodbye to my parents and Emma, I crossed the road, and started the trail. Oh yeah, 10 feet in I tripped! A little while later I met Rainbow, she has amazingly colorful hair. She is very nice and understandingly patient. We then met up with Yuke. Didn't understand his name but we reached the shelter around 3pm and soon figured it out. He was carrying a ukulele in his bag! Not long after we met Maggie and her owner. Maggie is this cute little black and white dog that was hiking southbound from Katadin. What an amazing dog! Of course she stole my heart. 3 snake sightings which wasn't great but getting better about it. Day 1, not too bad.","Monson, Maine

Brittany Cudeck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570893,"Day 2, It was very cold last night. I did not pack the right sleeping bag! Early start for Rainbow and I. Nice easy incline for a while (9miles) to the Moxie Bald Lean-to. It was amazing there. So beautiful and would have loved to stay there but the next lean-to was only 4 miles away and if we didn't do that 4 then we would have 2 mountains to climb the next day. That wasn't happening! So we had lunch took a break on a rock sitting next to this beautiful lake and were on our way an hour later....boy did it stink putting shoes and socks back on. Forcing rivers is interesting. The first day Yuke lost his flip flop today I jumped in after my hiking pole. Oh boy. We hiked Moxie Bald mountain, it was a good hike. Very beautiful at the top but could not figure out how to get down. Thanks to the northbound hikers coming up!!! Great day but starting to get some blisters.","Horseshoe Canyon lean-to

Brittany Cudeck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570897,"Yep, I need a better sleeping bag. Froze again last night! Today we hike a mountain and then into town. I have a blister (or 5) on my feet and they hurt like hell. I think this section could have gone a bit faster if I didn't hate my feet. They hurt so bad. Rainbow is so conditioned and fast I feel like I'm holding her back but met a brother sister duo that started when and where I did so I may spend some time with them. They are nice, very young, and her feet hurt too! I feel for her. The day started out at a 2 mph pace and forcing the river was fun today. It had lots of rocks to hop. Rainbow can't figure out how I find the route so quickly but I love it. It is like a game to me. She has started calling me rock hopper. Not sure it will stick but we shall see. I really suck at going up hill. Wow I feel old and out of shape. Hope this gets better. We climbed the mountain and I met her at the next shelter where she was chatting with three other hikers. I was so tired but needed to get some water before we hiked the last 5.7 miles to the hostel. Of course it started raining, why wouldn't it?!?! I couldn't find my pack cover so I had to empty out my entire bag. The three guys at the shelter laughed at me and offered up some advice on things to get rid of. Can't say I disagree. I will be mailing them home in the morning. Hopefully lighter pack will equal happier feet. That and some duct tape. Got to the hostel in the back of a pickup truck that felt bad for us. We stayed at the Sterling Inn. The owners there were very nice and informative. They dropped us off at a bar in West Forks called Three Rivers, food was awesome! We stayed there a little bit by a fire and watched some fireworks then gimped back to the car. I can't tell you how bad my feet hurt!!!!! Being in a warm bed after a hot shower was a welcomed love. Finally toasty warm!!!Â ","Bald Mountian Brooke Lean-to

Brittany Cudeck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571543,"Such a up and down day. It started with pulled pork sandwiches and milk shakes at the Caratunk B and B. There I ordered new (bigger) shoes from Amazon. Gotta love prime but still said 4 days shipping. weird but it will take me the long to get to the next hostel in Stratton, Maine. Left there and went to the ferry. It was a lady in a canoe that took you across the river, kind of funny but very helpful. She was so super nice and her husband would just sit on the riverbank telling people to fill out release forms! Got across and had a little under 4 miles to the closest shelter. Thank God it was only that far cause my feet hurt so bad by this point I was traveling about a mile an hour and it was fairly flat. The brother sister duo who we had met and rainbow went on without me. I eventually caught them a while later. I was able to see a bunch of waterfalls on this short leg. They were very pretty and I probably would have seen more if I was willing to waste the painful steps! When I got to the lean to there were a bunch of people there who decided that I needed to pop some of my blisters. I couldn't do it, so a girl named Wild Card cheerfully spoke up and volunteered to. She asked me for my knife and looked way to happy to stab me with it. Well apparently my knife wasn't sharp enough so she pulled out hers and it was a dagger! Did the trick!!! The shelter had an amazing view of the lake and a great sunset. Too bad I was already asleep while it was still light out but I heard about it!!!","Caratunk, Maine

Brittany Cudeck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571544,"Well, today everyone planned to do 18 miles. My feet felt better and relieved so I thought I could do it, it was pretty flat. I started by 6ish and was on my way by myself. Rainbow had already left. This section didn't have any waterfalls but did have some great bridges. They were pretty cool that went through the swampy areas and little bridges over bogs. Was nice to walk on. I had a good time on this section and felt pretty great. Passed some beautiful ponds that I got to walk next to for a while. Some fishermen asked if I needed anything. People are very nice on the trail. Its pretty crazy and I often find myself restoring faith in the human race. I got to the West Carry Lean to just in time to sit down and watch Rainbow and a few others get up to start the rest of their hike. I needed lunch so I thought I would stay and eat. There was this strange bin in the shelter, apparently, a woman bakes cookies and brings them across the lake 3-4 times a week for hikers. What dedication. I was not luck enough to get one but still pretty cool. I was going to wait for the brother sister duo to come and continue hiking with them. The time passed by and no one came. I got lonely and a little worried. Decided to get out my sleeping bag and take a little nap. Woke up shortly after to a northbound hiker. He wasn't a favorite but at least a person. He said he saw the duo about 3 hours ago so I gave up hope having them to hike with. My tent is so small and the bugs were so bad I decided to set it up in the shelter since it was only him and I. Later another man came. He was super cool. He works for the Darn Tough sock company. Fancy that, it was the kind of socks I was wearing!!! Didn't know they have a lifetime guarantee, score one for me. We talked for a while and fell asleep for the night.","Pierce Pond Lean-to

Brittany Cudeck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571546,"Well it was an early morning. I was off. The first couple on miles sucked. Super buggy and wet. Luckily pretty flat. The black flies were awful. I will never understand why they like to commit buggy suicide and dive bomb you right in the eyeball. No lie I had 5 bugs plunge into my eyes in less than 2 minutes at one point. I then hit flagstaff road and they just all of a sudden stopped. It was excellent. As I hiked up the road I passed a man who said he was a hiker waiting for some friends to pass by and was passing out coke and snacks to hikers passing by. I politely declined and kept walking. I started up little Bigelow toward the lean to that most of the hikers I stayed with 2 nights ago had reached in the original 18 miles. It was a beautiful shelter and location. When I got there 2 girls and a big malamute dog were just leaving. I of course pet the dog first! After they left made some lunch. Mashed potatoes are very filling. Filled my water bottles and continued on up the mountain. I thought I was at the top but then turned the corner and there was more up. It was crazy and defeating. On the plus side I finally had good phone service. I decided to stop and take a break and check my confirmation for my shoes to be delivered. Come to find out Amazon hadn't even shipped them yet. I was devastated. I lost all want to keep walking. My feet hurt so bad and my speed dwindled to next to nothing having no hope in sight of possible happy feet. I didn't want to spend lots of time stuck in a town waiting for shoes. My time had already been cut so short. I kept slowly walking, depressed. I made a wrong turn (actually went straight instead of turning) and followed a view path that led me to a cliff with a great sunny view and a steep drop. Was confused and upset so I did what anyone would do, I called my mom. She listened to my shoe issue and said ""I wish there was something I could do for you"" as I was tearing up it came to me. She could. She was in Lake Placid where she could go to EMS and buy my shoes!!! She did just that and sent them out. I was so happy and so excited. I found a new energy. When I got to the turn off for the campsite I was worried no one would be there. It was .2 miles off the path. I hustled down it to see if anyone was there getting worried when it led me through a cave and then didn't hear anyone. Finally getting to the site. There were 2 Canadian groups and a couple. I stayed by the couple and pitched my tent. It poured all night.","West Carry Pond Lean to

Brittany Cudeck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571549,"My tent is so wet and heavy. Looking up the Avery peak mountain 4000' up it looked daunting. I eventually got there. It was pretty but overcast and quickly becoming cloudy. I needed to keep moving, a storm was coming in quick. I got down Avery and was about to go up Big Bigelow but heard thunder. I was on the top of a notch in a thunder storm do I hike on on hunker down. I set up my tent to wait it out. 10 minutes later I took it down and went for it. I got to the top of the big Bigelow peak and couldn't see anything. Decided to take a picture of the sign and high tail it down in hopes to beat the storm. Needless to say this is the fastest I have ever moved! I didn't beat the storm. It definitely rain on me. I got over the horn and to the campsite. The first person I saw I asked where they were camping and if I could join. They of course said yes. Come to find out it was a group of 4 day hikers that had been hiking with each other for a while but had originally met on Instagram. It was pretty crazy but they were awesome. Made lots of jokes, sang lots of songs and made everything into a movie quote. My kind of people. One brought 2 cans of beer, one a platypus bag of whiskey and the third a nalgene bottle of tequila. It was crazy! They were entertaining and fun. Definitely lifted my spirits. The privey at this shelter is worth mentioning because there were two of them and they framed Sugarloaf ski area when you were looking at them. It made me giggle. Good times!!!","Stafford Notch Campsite

Brittany Cudeck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571550,"I finally cooked some oatmeal for breakfast, wasn't great but was ok. Packed my stuff, said goodbye to my new friends and was on my way. 5 miles later I made a call to the Stratton Hostel and a man named tree hugger answered, I knew this was going to be fun. Got all checked in and took a shower. I love a shower. It is so great. I can't even explain the smile on every single hikers face after they take a shower. Its so delighted and great. Mine is no different. From there I had lots of time so went to do laundry and drink a local veer while waiting. It was yummy and deserved. I learned a lot today and tomorrow at the hostel. How it was run, what slack packing was and why it is beneficial but very expensive. The people here were awesome. We are definitely in the middle of nowhere though lol. Oh yeah and the best part of at (besides a bed and shower) I GOT MY SHOES!!!!! Can't wait to go hiking Tuesday morning. I saw Rainbow at the hostel but she is slack packing and making decent time. Hoping to catch her in the next few days. We shall see. I have a new spirit and can't wait to unleash it!!!","Horn Pond Lean to
