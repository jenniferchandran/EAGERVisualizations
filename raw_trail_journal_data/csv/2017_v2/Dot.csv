Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554511,"Hey guys!My name is Briana, and I am planning to Hike the Appalachian Trail Southbound starting sometime around early June in 2017. I’m so stoked to share my experience with you! I am currently a senior at Sweet Briar College working on a double major in music and French. I’ve been in school my whole life. I’m ready to step away from the books for awhile. I’m a songwriter, and I am secretly hoping that by documenting my AT adventure, I will expand my fanbase for my music.A little bit about me, I mean there’s lots of things about me that aren’t me anymore, so when I say me, I mean me right now because I’m always changing. I eat a plant based diet, and it makes me feel amazing. I am planning to continue with this on the trail. I am by no means a perfect vegan, I shy away from this label a little bit. I sometimes cheat and I make mistakes and I eat local honey, but dangit I give it a good go! It’s a great way to live. I’ll be talking about what it’s like as a vegan on the trail throughout my blog, stay tuned!So why have I decided to spend 6 months in the woods? My shortest and favorite answer is that it’s just something that I feel like I need to do. I don’t think I can move onto the next chapter of my life until I complete this trail. It’s been calling my name for four years, ever since the director of the outdoor program at Sweet Briar College in 2014 introduced me to the AT. I thought, wait a minute, there’s a trail that goes all the way from Maine to Georgia? Ever since then it’s been heavy on my mind and it’s about to become a reality for me.

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556364,"I'm starting to see a lot of NOBO hikers posting, and I am getting pretty anxious about starting my SOBO hike in a few months! I only have a few more pieces of gear to buy. I'm trying to go as ultralight as possible on a budget (which means I'm not going to be ultralight), and I'm thinking that I am going to sacrifice my bulky self inflating therm-o-rest for a z-pad. They are just so light weight and easy maintenance and CHEAP. I think my body will adapt quickly to the pad if I do make the switch. Other than that, I need to buy some rain pants and a few odds and ends and my pack will be ready! I went on a little climbing trip to the Red River Gorge in Kentucky last week over my school break. (An amazing...amazing place to climb!) Every time I'm outside, I get so hyped up about hiking the trail. I also got to try out my new sleeping bag on this trip. I bought a synthetic 30 degree quilt from Enlightened Equipment (I don't like buying and supporting down products). I'm super excited about it, however I might have to start with my heavier bag for the first bit. I'd rather be a little heavy than freezing at night. The quilt is going to be so awesome for most of the hike though, so lightweight, I'm pretty stoked about it. If you are in the market, check out their website. They custom make the bags for you. I even got to choose the colors. Purple and black for me :-) 
Also, I signed up for a 30 day free trial on thrive market. It's sort of like an online health food store. Normally there's an annual membership fee, like costco, but the first month is free. The products are discounted on this website, and if you buy enough, shipping is of course free. I've started buying some yummy vegan snack foods! My closet is slowly filling up. If you decide to try their membership, make sure to cancel it before the trial is over. The company is not very willing to help you cancel the membership. 
I hope all the NOBO hikers are staying warm and dry. I can't wait to get on the trail!!!

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556820,"It's odd to be a senior in college and instead of trying to get into a masters program or find a job, I'm preparing to hike in the woods for six months. Sometimes I feel a little bit judged by my advisors and mentors in my life. I imagine that I am not the only one feeling this way. I don't see anything wrong with taking some time off to get to know myself. I look at this journey as time to check in and slow everything down. Way down. I want simplicity. One trail, white blazes, one foot and then another. That's all it is. I get asked all of the time why I am doing this hike, but I also get asked about my experience. I'd like to address this for other hikers who get asked the same thing and maybe feel a little off guard from the question. You don't need to have experience doing something in order to do it. I am all for experiential learning and highly encourage it! The trail is a great place for learning. That being said, I have worked for my school's outdoor program throughout college and I feel plenty prepared and knowledgable for my thru-hike. If I can lead a group of peers on a backpacking trip, I think I can take care of myself out there just fine. I also receive comments about how girls shouldn't hike alone, this is also absurd and makes me so angry. Any females who get told this, just tell them where to shove it. Seriously, this is the 21st century. I do understand where people are coming from. It's a long and slightly dangerous journey. But if you feel the need to thru-hike, or whatever else moves you, you should do it. ~Bria briamccall.com",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sat",0
Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563626,"Does anyone have suggestions for kindle books, audio books, or music / playlists on spotify? Let me know if you do. You can leave a message in the guest book with ideas. 
I am all done with college which is crazy! I have completed a music major as well as a french major. I'm still surprised at myself for pulling off this french major. When I decided to study abroad in Nice, France my junior year, I figured that my music major is almost finished, so may as well major in French as well. By gosh I did, good job self. Two not very useful majors for the price of one, both backed by four exciting years at Sweet Briar College. 
For my senior capstone project in music, I created a concept album of ten original songs called Machine. If you are interested in listening to it, here is a link https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/br... It's also available on iTunes, just search Bria McCall MACHINE. I've put a lot of hours into this project and it's a weird feeling to be done. 
Today I went on a practice hike. This is my second practice hike so far, both about 7 miles. The first one I think my pack was weighing around 25 lbs if I had to guess. Everything worked well except my shoes rubbed my right pinky toe. I have a pair of Salomon XA Pro 3D. Today, however, they didn't rub. I will make sure to have moleskin with me on the trail. I also bought a pair of Oboz Sawtooth shoes that are coming in the mail. Figured I'd pick up a second pair of shoes while I still have pro deals from my college outdoor program job.
Today my pack weighed in at 33 pounds according to my roommate's bathroom scale. Not sure how accurate it is. I stuffed my 53L gregory pack as full as I could. I wanted to hike at the max weight I will be at on the trail. I even threw in some cans of soup for extra weight, so hopefully I will never be over 30. The pack felt fine. We will see if it still feels fine when I'm up to 20 miles a day. 
I have several food sponsors for this hike. The biggest is Santa Fe bean company. They sent me a giant U-haul box stuffed full of beans. I have a video of my roommate jumping out of it like a jack in the box toy. When I came back from my practice hike, she had made a pack of them because... let's be real, it's the end of the school year and we are all too lazy to food shop. My backpacking stash is too convenient. I made a big burrito with the leftover beans and it was pretty tasty. If there's one thing I would want a big U-haul box full of, Santa Fe beans would be one of them. 
Both times I came back from hiking, I've been exhausted. I took a long nap today only to be woken up by my mom calling to ask about what she should wear to my graduation. My school colors are pink and green. She informed me that she is wearing a pink dress and picked out a pink polo shirt for my dad...if only you knew my dad. I politely suggested she take the shirt back and dress my dad in black or gray. I then went to dinner where I stuffed my face at the cafeteria. They had a decent vegan meal which are few and far between. I took advantage. I've been trying to eat a lot lately. I could really use some extra weight for the hike. I've even been eating some non-vegan foods. This is mostly because I'm a cheap college student with a mandatory meal plan to the school cafeteria. Sometimes my wallet and my morals say two different things.
 I can only imagine how much I will be eating on the trail. Dear stomach...it's time to stretch.",,Sweet Briar College,"May 08, Mon",0
Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567697,"I woke up this morning starfished in a strange bed with a golden retriever on my right leg. I heard Red making coffee outside the bedroom and I realized the day had finally come. Today am starting my SOBO flop starting from NOC in North Carolina, hiking down to Springer, flying up to Maine and coming back to NOC. This bed is comfortable but my nerves pull me out of it. I cant help but think about how if I were a Dude, my friend Red would have probably not offered his bed for me. Before NOC, I make Red take me by ERA (Endless River Adventures). Conveniently he works there and my friends from Sweet Briar outdoor program are all there. My previous boss gives me a big hug and insists on going with Red and I to the drop off. I don't mind, We go to NOC, take pictures, exchange hugs and I fight back tears. Then suddenly I am hiking, just like that. I've felt the alone-ness many different ways today- I like the isolation, but I've never taken it to this extreme before. Many doubts about the adventure have crossed my mind today. I've came across quite a few people, but they are all strangers to me and my introverted-ness is coming through headstrong. I ate lunch at a shelter with some hikers, but felt out of place. I set up camp at a campsite three miles from the next shelter to avoid people. Now that I'm set up, I think I should have hiked the extra three miles.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567992,"I wake up to rain, it rained all night as well. When I used to lead backpacking trips with Sweet Briar, I did everything I could to keep participants happy in bad weather. I now play those games with myself and they work pretty well. I feel good and the temperature is nice. I pack snacks on top and I'm extra careful to toll up my trash bag lining in my pack so no water gets in. Rain is in the forecast for the next 3 days. I'm thankful that I filtered water the night before as I head out, planning to go 14 miles. I stop at a shelter for lunch to get out of the rain and I run into a guy I met yesterday who is finishing his SOBO from last year. My feet, hips and shoulder are hurting as I pick up after lunch. Lancelot and I pass each other several times and I hike with him for a few miles. We pass some of his friends and he introduces me as on of the first 2017 SOBO's. I eventually lose sight of him in front of me. The last two miles of my planned 14 were difficult. My body hurts. I finally reach the shelter, unpack, eat dinner, change, filter water, etc. I turn on my phone and text my friend Red. I ask if he can pick me up tomorrow night so I can get out of this rain. He recommends that I hike to Franklin, four miles away, tonight. I dont hesitate, I change back into my wet clothes, pack up and I hike. The easiest and fastest four miles yet. I reach the parking lot by eight to find my car waiting for me. I feel a little less guilty knowing its my gas he's using to pick me up. Back at his place, the golden retriever is now back on the bed with me. This place no longer feels strange to me.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567996,"I took my first zero day! Figured it wont hurt to give my body a day off while I have a house to hang out in. The dog snuggled with me all night. She's amazing. So thankful for Red and how helpful he's been. He took me to buy a new stove today. I love my popcorn stove dearly, but I made a switch to a pocket-rocket style stove. It's made by Jetboil, a bit heavier but a lot lower maintenance. I also dropped a pair of pants in my car that I dont think I'll need. My gear is almost all dry. The lactic acid in my calves is insane! Definitely a little tender bodied today. 
I'm really looking forward to getting to Maine, we will all be new to the trail and going the same direction. Making friends will be easier. I'm trying to keep the dog from slobbering all over this paper right now, but she's so adorable. 
I've napped , watched movies, took a walk and did some yoga today. Ready to get back on the trail. 
Eric D- I swear.. If you say I told you so about the stove... ;)
Mom and Dad- I'm still alive and Mom, so thankful for that nice rain jacket you got me a few years back.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567997,"This morning Red dropped me off at the trail head around 8 AM. I felt well rested. My left shoulder running into my neck has been throbbing all day. Momo I should have gone to the chiropractor before I left like I said I was going to. My feet have no blisters, but after about 12 miles today they started throbbing. They are already becoming callused. I hiked 19 miles today, a new record. I thought I was going to fell over on the last four. I was fumbly and mumbly and so so tired, I probably shouldn't have pushed so hard today. But there were boy scouts at the shelter at 16 miles and I didn't want to deal with them. I also have a very determined mindset when I get something in my head. I really wanted to reach 19. I'm going to have to stay aware of that so I don't over do and hurt myself. Earlier today I used a privy at a shelter and a mouse popped out at me. I hate mice. An old lady of 60 crossed my path today. She was taking on the trail one step at a time and she impressed me. I've been eating like a mouse. I haven't felt hungry, but I try to get enough calories in. I'm looking forward to the hunger setting in, it will make food much better. I feel like I'm not thinking clearly, I'm so pooped out. I'm going to do some tent yoga and go to bed.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568545,"Pretty easy day today. I had a lazy morning. The weather has been perfect. No shoulder pain and only a few whimpers from my feet. My body is taking on this trail like a champion. I passed these two ladies earlier today who are section hiking and they just rolled in to the campsite. Im staying right on the border of NC and Georgia tonight, where the twisted tree is. Its nice to have some people around. I've sure been spending a lot of time alone lately. I dont really need human interaction, but other humans around is nice. So today a NOBO told me that  SOBO's food got taken by a bear last night. I later found out that that SOBO was Lancelot, the guy I was hiking with a few days ago. He was getting off the trail today anyway, but I became nervous because I dont have a bear hang setup. I was told by a mentor that she never used her bear hang and I probably wouldnt need one. I think Im going to pick up a bear hang the next chance I get. At least in Georgia there are bear hang setups in shelters. That'll be really clutch. You know my ol z-pad isnt as bad as I thought it was going to be. I also have a little blue sit pad and I place it under the z-pad where my hips are. It helps a lot since Im a side sleeper. My backpack I place at my feet so that they are propped up and some blood will flow out of them. Welp... think I'm going to read some tonight after some tent yoga.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568547,"I'm at Deep Gap Shelter in Georgia right now. I got here pretty early. Trying to take my time and take it easy on my body. Taking breaks is critical to backpacking. When you think you have nothing left, just sit down, put your feet up and eat a snack. I'm ready to start puching hard again. Two guys stopped by the shelter for sinner. They were really cool. We ahd a conversation that went farther than the weather. I gave them a pack of Santa Fe beans. I overpacked food, but also havent been eating as much as I should be. My pack, in general is heavier than it needs to be. Its going to be a gradual process to get it down to a good weight. Most everything is brown and light green except for the occasional wild flower. very few straight lines, which I like. When I'm hiking, Im extremely comfortable being alone. My body is leading my mind on this journey. My body is so much cooler than any machine. It is adaptable and willing and strong. We are capable of so much. I remember thinking that a year or so ago when I lived in France. Learning a second language through emersion only begins to tap into our human capabilities. On the AT, instead of my mind, its my body im testing. Yes, it still takes a sort of mental strength to backpack, but not comparable to language emersion. Im hoping more people come tonight, Im tired of being alone.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569135,"Today kicked my butt! So many ups and downs. Whew. I stopped at a shelter for a snack and run into these two really cool guys! They were great to talk to. I pulled out my bag of sour patch kids and told them that these candies are going to get me through the trail. They told me sour patch oughta be my trail name. I told them I already have one and it's Dot. I was sort of lying, but I like Dot for many reasons, so Dot it is. I told them to look for my blog. There are so many people out for the long weekend. It's crowded everywhere but at least I'm not lonely. I've had a lot of good conversations today. I still haven't found Dory! I thought today would be the day. Dory is a SOBO and everyone coming North says I'm not far from her. It's my goal to find Dory. I'm not sure if she's ahead or behind me now because I heard she is resupplying today. My tent is taught as F*... I'm getting the hang of my gear for sure. I feel like I've been out here a really long time. I ate dinner with an older couple that were really nice, but the guy was kind of a know-it-all trying to tell me what I should and shouldn't do; I don't think he realizes that I actually know my shit. I just smiled and went with hi. Whatever dude. I'm going to try for twenty miles tomorrow to Neel Geup, or maybe its 19, something like that.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569136,"I woke up at 6 this morning, packed up and headed towards Neel Gap in hopes to avoid the rain. I did. I was on fire fore the first 8 miles I listened to Alexander Hamilton and really enjoyed it (thanks Jess for the recommendation). I started losing steam around mile 10, but I kept pushing hard in hopes to reach the hostel. There were some amazing views today. I ended up reaching the hostel with plenty of time to spare. The AT literally goes through this place. It's a fun place! I recommend stopping. $18 for a bed, shower including shampoo, and soup. After a long while without a shower and rain in the forecast it looked pretty good to me. There are three girls tonight, the rest are boys. We are all sleeping close to each other. Girls just gravitate to each other in general, I feel like. I picked up a food re-supply today. It was like getting a present! I had some extra food, but luckily there was a box in the hostel for un-wanted food. It's really full. There's a bald guy with a beard telling stories in the bunk room. He works in a prison and has some good stories to tell. I lost my knife awhile ago. I asked the guy at the gear store if they sell any. He whipped out one from his pocket and told me I could keep it. Score! I'm currently 31 miles to Springer. Time to send to these pages to my Bro-Bro to post on my blog. A big shout out to him for helping me out with this blog!","

This morning I bought a tiny tiny bear hang and more Sour Patch Kids and headed out. The guy whom gave me a pocket knife yesterday, Holy Diver, was going on a prep trip for the PCT. He came up behind me and I let him pass. I ended up hiking with him for several miles until he truned off. I didn't realize how much I was enjoying his company until he was gone. Ran into a lady heading north with a pack as big as her. She was flying high, told me she just quit her job and was going on the trail as far as she goes. Good luck to her. I felt tired all day today. Around mile 5, I stopped at a campsite by the river, pulled out my z-pad and took a nap. Around 430 pm I passed through Woody Gap, and stopped and made dinner with a guy who was also making food. Everyone is fresh faced, wide-eyed, and heading north...except for Dory. A girl came strolling through the gap and I stood up from the park bench, ""Hey, are you Dory?"" I asked. She looked at me confused and responded ""Yes.."". ""I found Dory!"" I yelled. She laughed. I think she's heard that one before. I introduced myself and she went on. Many hours later, after some slow hiking on my part, I strolled up to a shelter and I hear ""Hey there Dot!"" Not only have I found Dory, but now we are friends. I'm content. There are a lot of fun people at this shelter (Gooch Mountain Shelter). It's a double-decker! I'm sleeping up-top tonight. Georgia is spoiling me these shelters, hostels, bear cables and canisters. Tomorrow I will be just about done.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569138,"I think my body is going to be excited to have a few days off. I am currently .2 miles from the Springer Summit which is the end of the AT going south. However, to get to Amicalola State Park, there is an 8 mile approach trail that I will go down tomorrow. The past few days I have started listening to music or audio books while I hike. I get this giddy/childish feeling that comes over me and fills me with energy. Music will do that to a person. When I'm hiking to good music, it reminds me of how I sometimes felt playing in the steel orchestra in college, sometimes I'd be just full of it. I like when I'm in that ""head-space"", I miss creating music. If you have any music/book recommendations, comment in the guest log or even spotify playlist to share. I've become very comfortable and confident on the trail. But I guess overall that was the point of this small section down south. I'm glad that I decided to do this. The loneliness hasn't been around for a long while. I've had lots of company. Tonight my tent was set up within talking distance of Dory. I've learned a lot my body, mind, gear, and how to be efficient. I've also learned some new trails terms such as ""Pink Blazing"",essentially when a guy starts following a girl on the trail. Dory taught me that one, along with tricks like leaving zippers on my pack unzipped so mice can go in and out and wont try to chew through. I hate mice. Time for tent yoga.","

I am in no rush. I ate breakfast with two guys, one had family in St. Maries, ID, which is practically where I grew up. Small world. When Dori was finally ready I headed behind her to the summit. She was extremely emotional. Let me tell you there's nothing terribly special about Springer Mountain other then it's the end of the trail. I left Dory at the summit and I started heading down the 8 mile approach trail. I had a two hour phone call on the way with my mom. You know I really don't think it matters where one starts or ends on the trail it's the completion that matters. My pack is really light 20 pounds. When I get to Amicalola State Park, there's people everywhere and not backpackers but people people. I feel out of place. Everyone keeps talking to me, curious, or they just stare. They don't even know about the Appalachian Trail. This shocks me. The park is nice with a giant waterfall and so so many stairs. Also, there is an AT shelter by the visitor center as well as a shower in the woman's bathroom by the playground. There was no shower curtain, so I showered in my bra and underwear. They needed washed as well anyway. I called Ron Brown about getting a shuttle into Atlanta tomorrow. $90 he told me over the phone. I felt like I was playing to safe. I want cheap adventure. I headed back up to the reflection pond at the base of the waterfall to try to hitch a ride. I run into an older couple that was talking to earlier. ""you lost the braids"", said the old lady. I told him I took a shower and I'm trying to get to Atlanta for my friend to pick me up tomorrow. ""Well we don't know you, and you don't know us but you're welcome to come with us, even spend the night if you want"" said the lady. Jackpot! I played timid to them, not wanting them to know that I had this planned. ""we're grandparents"" said the lady, as if that was supposed to make me feel better. So, here comes my first hitch experience. Sorry mom and dad, I know these things freak you out, but I am fine. It's part of the experience.


These people are so nice to me. Literally wine and dined me. I eat so much. When we get to their place, I take a nice shower, do laundry, and change into a pair of sheila's clothes. I talk with them a while, they give me chocolate, and eventually we go to bed. I sleep so well in their guest bedroom. I feel so free. I have no commitments, I'm just living. I'm homeless technically. I'm happy.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569792,"Crazy day! Crazy crazy day. I wake up, go downstairs, and Sheila and Kris had me coffee, steel cut outs and a plethora of toppings. I eat two bowls. I feel like a teenage boy. Looking at myself in the mirror last night, I've already dropped weight. I don't have much to lose, so food is something greatly valued these days. I convince Sheila to take me to a bus station so that I can get to the heart of Atlanta. She's skeptical of public transportation, but takes me. It was a bit sketchy, not gonna lie even for me. I lived in France for a year, I understand public transportation. So I eventually get my ticket and get on the bus with cash in hand that Sheila had slipped me before I left. I tried to refuse, but she insisted. They were too good to me. On this bus, I am the only white person. On top of this, I'm wearing crocs and carrying a backpack with trekking poles sticking out. Everyone is wondering what in the hell I'm doing. Eventually I make my way to Centennial Olympic Park. I end up connecting with a friend of a friend. She picks me up and says ""I know you're vegan and hungry, let's get vegan donuts"" I think she's my angel. We bought a dozen donuts with the intent to eat them all. We manage half before feeling sick. My eyes, I guess, are still bigger than my stomach. Not long after, we went for pizza. She was a great tour guide, so glad I met up with her! After a day of exploring she drops me off back at the park. This time, on top of the backpack I was also carrying a donut box and a pizza box. Such a weird day. Not long after, my friend Bryan came and picked me up. I haven't seen him in three years and it was so great to see his face. I threw my pack in his car, fed him donuts and pizza as he drove us to Savannah, talking the whole way. He such a jabber box and he turned me into one as well. He is in the army, so my AT stories don't even come close to his training stories. Man oh man! He even brought me a change of clothes, which was so sweet. I'm glad I'm able to spend some time with him, but wish I had a few more days. He went to Virginia military Institute and I went to Sweetbriar. When I was a freshman, I went to a ballroom dancing class at VMI and that is how we met. We are usually too busy and too far apart to connect,  so this is really a special treat to stay with him. My body is totally soaking up these days off. I'm feeling a little anxious about starting in Maine. Once I get started, I'm sure I'll be fine. It's also challenging to be with a good friend like this and then just leave every type of comfort I have created, jump on a plane, and start this really crazy adventure. But I still have tomorrow to enjoy, good friends and new places and showers.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569793,"I woke up so early this morning. I didn't even try to sleep in, it was hopeless. I got up and walked around Bryan's bachelor pad. It's really nice. He seems like such an adult. I guess he is. He's two years older than me. I remember going to a V I dance with him several years ago and he would walk into a room and everyone knew his name. Everyone loved him. He is so stinking good at what he does, and he's always in a good mood. I eventually get restless and wake him up. We eat leftover donuts and smoothies for breakfast. Smoothies! In normal life, that is my breakfast every day, a giant smoothie. We go to the store and I get some food for dinner and I pick up some sorbet gelato. Not for the gelato, though we did later eat it, but for the container. Perfect size for rehydrating food in. I also take some wind paper, envelopes, stamps, and these awesome heavy duty plastic bags. Thanks Brian. The day slipped by too fast. Per my grandma's request, we go visit old mansions, walk around, and eat downtown, and then we go to the beach! The beach! Keep in mind that all I have is one pair of clothes and layers. I've been wearing his T-shirts to have a break from my usual purple tank top. I wear my sports bra and shorts swimming. The warmth and the salt surprise me. We swim untill our fair skin makes us get out and cover up. ""you ever seen an alligator?"" Ryan asked me. I have not. He takes me to a crab restaurant where they have a little habitat for alligators. I freak out. I love almost all creatures, except mice, and these alligators are adorable. I feel like I am looking at an ancient dinosaur. They are so lazy, just waiting for food. They are smaller than I expected. We eventually head back to the bachelor pad. Bryan goes for a run and I take a shower and make dinner. He has everything I need to cook. When he comes back we watch Forrest Gump. I've never seen it before. By the time it ends, it's late. We both know this visit is almost over, and it feels pretty sucky to have this part of my trip end, but I have miles to hike.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569794,"3:30 AM comes way too early. I slide outta bed like a fish, do some morning stretches, and pack up my pack. I change back into my black shorts, and purple tank top with my fleece over top. I wake up Brian, apologizing and thanking him for taking me to the airport so early. He poured me a glass of orange juice, handed me some Cliff bars, and goes over things I might have forgotten to pack. I haven't forgotten anything. He comes to the airport and watches me as I go through customs. Damn boy almost makes me cry as I look back. ""he'll fade"" I tell myself ""they always do."" There's something about leaving comfort for the unknown that makes adventuring alone challenging. It's always the transitions that get me. I don't know a single soul in Maine. I'm sure in a few days I'll be swimming with friends, but walking into the ocean is scary. I have two flights today and I sleep through both of them. I'm pretty used to airports. I tend to go numb in them, pushing emotions away. There's always emotions to push away traveling alone. I am pleased when I pick up my pack at the baggage claim. Nothing is broken. I figure out where the bus station is at to get from Bungor to Medway. I walk about 15 minutes to the bus station, but get sidetracked at the grocery store. I pick up some tortillas, dark chocolate, and some plums, and a Naked drink. Snacks for today and some trail food. I'm nervous about my food resupply arriving on time at the hostel. Hopefully it's still there. It starts raining while I am shopping, so when I come out, I wait under the cover for it to stop. People look at me as I wait. I feel homeless. I am homeless. The bus for Medway does not leave until 6:30 PM. I have about four hours. At least I'm inside and have food and water. Eventually hikers come. Lots of us. Almost a dozen. I start talking with them, but I feel empty inside. I'm not in the right headspace for this today. After the bus drops us off at Medway, a man from the hostel comes with a van to pick us up. I'm now at the hostel. I feel stressed and anxious. My resupply isn't here, but they said that they can bring it Tuesday morning. That should work. I have enough for tomorrow. I wasn't hungry for dinner, but I made myself eat regardless. Once I get on the trail with my resupply on my back, I think I'll feel a lot better. Something about hiking to take away emotion. There are so many people out here at the hostel it's stressing me out. They all have a lot of energy coming from many different directions. Maybe I just need some sleep.","

My new hiking friends and I get up, strip our beds and head down the street for breakfast. I eat pancakes and oatmeal with a cup of coffee. There are around a dozen of us starting today, all eating together as well. This one guy named frostbite is like a clone of an old creative writing professor I had. He reminds me so much of Professor Casteen I get a little weirded out. We eventually make our way back and Ole Man shuttles us to Baxter. We sign in, get slackpacks and hit the trail bright eyed and bushy tailed. My legs feel really fresh and strong today. I fly up the mountain. 5.5 up and then once at the top, take the same way back. Once above the treeline the rock scramble trail becomes so much fun. I had a blast picking routes and climbing rocks. I'm a rock climber though. I love climbing. I reached a certain point when the clouds consumed me and a heavy wind and rain picked up. I looked down and my fleece and shorts were becoming frosted and my fingers numb, elevation change is crazy. I threw on rain gear and started slowing down, hoping that someone would catch up to me. Eventually Franky came along and we summit-ed together. I was starting to lose my mind a bit by myself with the extreme weather change, so I was thankful he came. By the time we got back to the bottom, I was getting hot in my fleece and shorts. Now that I'm not moving, I'm bundled up at my campsite, buff and all. The mosquitoes are annoying but overall bugs arent terrible today. I'm feeling good and ready to get going tomorrow.

Franky, Frostbite and I really cranked through the miles today. I'm not thinking to clearly right now. Mostly flat today, through lots of mud bogs and downed trees and river crossings to get through. I saw a moose today and a woodpecker and a  baby snake. The first 10 miles were getting out of Baxter, then there was a little store with backpacking goodies but expensive. Then I did 10 miles in the 100 mile wilderness. It was beautiful today. At one point Frostbie and I were taking a break on a big flat rock on the river and it was truly beautiful. we went really slow getting out of Baxter, but the first bit of the 100 mile isn't very interesting. So we cranked out miles. We are at a campsite along a lake. It's pretty nice. Guys I'm so pooped I cant even finish this sheet of paper. I'm going to stretch and go to bed.","

I mean we are camping at the same spot. I hiked laone most of today. Also a girl named Cukoo who started with us is here at the campground tonight, she keeps to herself. The trail was mostly flat today but it was hard. I often times had to stop and look around for the trail. I sort of miss Georgia. Everything was simpler and user friendly down there. I'm glad I pushed yesterday and today because I dont have much more than 8 days worth of food. I need to keep pushing to get out of here. I'm not quite getting enough calories I think. After this section I will start carrying more per day. Luckily right now if I lose some pounds, it wont hurt me. Sometimes the trail isn't fun. This is something to consider if you are thinkg about thru-hiking. It's hard and its work. Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing out here. There is so much trail in front of me. It's best to take it one day at a time, one mile at a time. I regret ditching my hiking pants in North Carolina. I might have them sent to me. I hate how much Deet I'm spraying on my skin.

We ran into a bunch of SOBO's at tonights shelter. There are so many people. I like that there's people, but I also like that I can lay in my tent and ignore them. I don't feel the need to be social so I'm not going to be. My feet hurt and I feel like a walking meat stick for the bugs. If only they were vegetarian like me. I try not to think about my bug bites. I don't acknowledge them and they don't exist... Until I just lose it, which happens. Today was beautiful and the trail was nice. For dinner tonight I had split pea soup with TVP, veggies, rice and potatoes. I then put salt and coconut oil in. It was really good. Franky and I stopped at a swim hole today. It was so nice. A guy named Jeff and his dog were there too. Sometimes I think I should feel weird stripping down to my sports bra and underwear around men I barely know, but its not weird. I like the way guys have treated me so far on the trail. They don't think any less of girl hikers. We are all just hiking. The weather has been too nice. Cukoo is here tonight as well. She's cool. She's quiet, but sweet and talkative when I talk to her. She wakes up really early and then puts in long days but still gets good camping spots. Smart. Tomorrow the elevation begins, wish me luck.","

So we went another 5 and it was 2 miles to the nearest shelter, so we went. We arrived by 4:30. I'm so proud of my body. I'm feeling good. It's raining and the bugs are gone. I'm sleeping with Franky on one side and Cukoo on the other. When I'm hiking and planning days, I always underestimate myself. But then I get to where I planned and forget about the pain and the sweat going up and down mountains, so I keep pushing. One foot and then another. We are currently talking about how much moose poop was all over the trail. There is a lot! I'm loving all the pine, especially when it started raining. It rained today btw, it's still raining. I dont mind. No bugs. After dinner I was still hungry. I'm telling you, teenage boy appetite big time. I've been listening to the handmaids tail on audible. A weird book, bu tit was some good ah-ha! moments like 1+1+1+1 doesn't = 4, but is still 1+1+1+1. Let that role around your brain for a while. I finished my sour patch kids. Sad. Luckily it'll only be a few days before I'm out of the 100 mile wilderness. SOBO's really get thrown into the trail. I'm thankful for my 140 miles down south.

Franky and I were slowly packing and getting ready and we must have seemed to be having a good time because a NOBO who stayed at the shelter commented on how refreshing out attitudes were compared to other SOBO's he's passed. I was just being my normal self. First five miles were smooth sailing; super easy. I had to ford a river and my feet were so cold. I'm so happy that I have Croc's for camp shoes. The rest of the day kicked my butt! Some steep trail today. Up and down x4. At one point I turned a corner and it was rock boulders straight up, refrigerator sized or smaller stacked. It was the devils trap for ankles. When I start to get lazy and I start tripping on the trail, I focus really hard on smooth foot placement. This is what I did up the rock face. Also climbing technique really helps. The best part of the day was running into Yoyo! He was at the hostel at the beginning. He did the trail NOBO and is now going SOBO. I almost didn't recognize him because he had shaved. A good looking dude! I asked him why he's yoyo-ing. ""Well,"" he said, slowing down his words ""I just needed more time."" I didn't say anything. ""That's the short answer."" he said. I nodded and changed the subject. He's now [t I'll probably run into him in Monson, the next town.

All my life, I've never noticed this act of play between the elements. Earlier today I stood atop a bald mountain as the wind sized up this skin sac of water and minerals that my soul possesses. This sac, this body that I care for is so much stronger than I can fathom, yet so fragile. Today I took a scary fall down a rock face. I somehow managed to not get hurt, but as I lay on my pack in the position I landed, still buckled in, the danger of this trail became very real to me. I'm thankful for the weather, especially the breeze that spent its day drying the bullets of sweat dripping down my face and catching my eyebrows. I love my eyebrows. They are growing out along with my other usually shaven areas. I feel free out here. One set of clothes and everthing I need in a sac on my back of this sac for my soul. 
I crossed two river fords today. As I crossed the second, I yelled across the river at my friend who was putting his shoes on. ""Hey Franky, wanna go swimming?"" I reached the other side, shed my pack and clothing down to my bra and underwear, and jumped back in. I waded up and let the current bring me back down. I haven't showered in a week and at this moment, yet I feel so clean, so refreshed, so pure and in tune with this body of mine that I am ever grateful for. I am currently at a shelter that is 4 miles from Monson. I plan to take a long break in town. This will be my first real town experience and let me say am I craving some pancakes.

We headed next door to Pete's for breakfast where we found Cukoo! I love that girl. I ate two big blueberry pancakes, two pieces of French Toast with syrup and brown sugar and a thing of beans. The food went down so easily. I can't describe how nice it is to take the day off. My body is quite thankful. This hostel is lovely. They even fed me watermelon and oreos. We keep watching movies, but no one watches. We are all talking and hanging out. There is a lot of weed and alcohol going around which I mean... Whatever, but I avoid the weed and am sort of a snob about what alcohol I consume and to cheap to buy it. There is a lot of weed on the trail. Hike your own hike I guess. This hostel is right by a lake and we can go swimming and kayaking, but honestly I'm happy hanging out inside. Hikers are so easy to please. A shower. If you really want to get fancy, throw us a cotton t-shirt. Some food, let us steal some toilet paper. Do some laundry.

This morning my pack felt heavy with the resupply. Resupplying kind of sucks in that sense. When Chelsea the caretaker at the hostel dropped us off, I gave her a big hug. It's amazing how quickly I can grow attached to some people. But only some. On the trail today, we forded two rivers. I love fords, I like taking my shoes off and letting the cool water soothe my tired feet. The weather was perfect for hiking, but a bit chilly for swimming.

I really wanted to knock on the door and try for a shower and bed, but I restrained myself. Instead, after finding the shelter I went down to the lake and went swimming. It was chilly. The shelter has the nicest privy. I'm very impressed. We could have pushed and made it to Caratonk today, but towns equal more money. So here I am in a shelter with good ol Franky and Frostbite.

They got to hear all about my frustration. The bugs were bad, so I sprayed some Deet on my bare legs. I then got out my bag of tortillas and rested them on my thighs. When I took them off, I had the bag design tattooed on my legs, calories in all. Deet is scary shit. Today was insane. I can't even tell you how much elevation we went up-and-down and the trail was no walk in the park.

They went down so easily. We called the hostel when we got to the highway, and they came and picked us up. By the time Franky and Frostbite had showered and eaten breakfast I smashed down three giant blueberry pancakes and eggs (I never eat eggs, but it sounded good). A lot of our friends who have been behind us arrived. One of them being Buck, I think he is such a cool guy. I hope he starts hiking our speed. You know, I haven't talked about many lady hikers. There's actually quite a few. The problem is other then Cuckoo, I keep passing all of them. It's kind of nice to be around a good group of guys after  four years at a women's college. However, everyone made a trip to the liquor store today. I have a ""no spending money on alcohol rule"" with myself, but I was offered plenty from others who aren't quite as concerned. I was sipping on moonshine as well as Kentucky bourbon, just enough for that little buzz. Frostbite killed the moonshine, he was so funny last night. He kept saying he was pickled. He convinced me to tango with him in the hostel hang out area. I kept stepping on his feet.

If I do insert my own comments or modifications, they will be indicated by closed brackets [].
A few notes before you get to her blog. Dot restarted her blog day count once she reached Maine to start the remaining portion of her SOBO hike. Unfortunately, the blogs from the first 14 days this second leg of the trip were lost. (Update: The blogs from the lost days have been found and will be updated) You can view Dot's videos from that time frame on her youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/B...). Today's blog is day 15 of this second leg. Now to Dot's own words!
There was a big storm rolling in today so we decided to take a full 0 day. I mean... we blamed our 0 day on the weather, but a day off is always nice.
For the most part, we've just been hanging out today. It's so freeing to not have much to do besides rest your body. Hiking the trail overall has been a very freeing experience. I've really been enjoying all of the people that I've been meeting. I feel like I have so many friends. I just came back from the common room where I was teaching Mary Poppins, a dude from Switzerland, how to play guitar. Frostbite and I have this mutual massage train going on, but I get the better deal since he's certified in massage therapy! He finds some gnarly knots in my back.
I finally had a good conversation with my parents. It's hard for is to get a hold of each other. My mom mostly [knows] how I'm doing through this blog. She asked me how I got my trail name ""Dot"". I told her from darn tough (tuff?) socks with polka dots that she got me for Christmas. She died laughing, thinking the name was silly. It is silly. I always tell people, ""Hi, my name's Dot. If you forget, just look at my socks"". I've also been called Dotty and Dot Dot, but everyone always remembers it. Its like my alter ego, or a second identity. Most people don't know my real name.

It was a sentimental moment. I thought to myself, ""These are my boys"". We are a ""family"".
Lots of elevation today leaving Stratton. For a while, the Appalachian Trail turned into the Appalachian River. There were some fun rock scrambles today but my pack felt really heavy. My pack weighs a lot more than the boys. It's all food, but they have been losing weight and I cannot afford to lose much. They are usually impressed by how much I can eat. I can put down some serious calories. I've been eating more vegetarian than vegan, especially in town. I even ate an omelet. It sounded good, but I didn't really enjoy eating it. Mary Poppins, from Switzerland, ironically gave me a piece of Swiss cheese at the shelter [Really Briana...of all cheeses the one that tastes like sweaty feet?]. I ate it. It was yummy.
We talked to a NOBO at the shelter and there isn't that many SOBOs ahead of us, maybe a dozen. We have been crushing miles of SOBOs. I love that we have caught up to Buck and Mary Poppins. They are such cool guys. People tell me all the time to take my time. I think that I am going the right speed for myself. That's all that matters. I enjoy pushing miles. I enjoy town days as well!

I'm on a time crunch so it has me stressed out. Franky and I slid out of the shelter with Frostbite sitting up just long enough to say that he was staying back with Mary and Buck. Probably a good choice.Today kicked my ass. The first ten miles I was a complete head case. At one point I was crying up a mountain. Nothing was wrong, I was just losing it. It happens. When I made it to a shelter for lunch, I came up dragging my trekking poles and avoiding eye contact with Franky because I was barely keeping myself together. He knew though. He started hiking behind me after that. At one point, I fell going down some wet, steep slab and later he described me as looking completely broken in that moment. I felt it. There was no flat today, [it was] either straight up or straight down. There was a flash flood at one point, making the rocks a dangerous balancing act. We were on a ridge line for a while that was quite beautiful, but the wind  was blowing so hard that I could barely walk on the trail without getting blown off into the brush. When we got down to the last 5 miles or so, I felt much better than in the morning  and I started thinking about dinner with Scout and Frodo.At 5am, I told Scout that our ETA was 5:30pm. We got to the parking lot at exactly 5:30pm. Called it! We met Frodo and started catching up with Scout. They took us to the hiker hut  where they had already reserved Franky and I a bed. We changed into cleaner clothes and went into town with them. Dinner was fabulous, but after hiking for over 12 hours, it was really challenging to sit through dinner. My knees were becoming so stiff and my body was aching. I had to get up and stretch at one point. I had a blueberry soda, water, white wine, veggie pasta that was vegan(!), and lemonberry cake. It was all amazing. The hiker hut is the cutest hostel in the world. These people live off the grid, solar outdoor shower, the works man. There are a bunch of little huts and buildings around and also gardens all around. It's so cute. I'm looking forward to a long sleep and lazy morning tomorrow.","

I can't believe how time flies.I woke up this morning at the lovely hiker hut in Rangeley. The weather was beautiful. I had a lazy morning and the lady running the place gave me some tea and pumpkin bread for breakfast, although I could have ate and drank so much more! I tried a chocolate [illegible] tea. Anyway, it was delicious. Buck, Mary, and Frostbite came in from the previous shelter around 9. We hung out and I played music for everyone. Around 10, I headed out for the trail which is really late for hikers. the trail was easy today, but my body was tired. At one point I stopped for a rest and I ate a pop tart, snickers, and reese's candy. I was on a sugar overload! I decided to camp right by a river ford. It's not a designated camping area, but nice and flat. I've had a lively and relaxing evening. I haven't slept in my tent for a good while, so it feels nice to be in my own space. I love my little nemo hornet tent.I want to give a big thank you to Scout and Frodo for taking me out to dinner last night. Scout has a journal on trail journals as well! I imagine he's mentioned me a time or two, he also puts pictures on his blog. He is one of the coolest people that I've met on the trail. I don't put many photos up, but I do post videos on youtube so go check those out! Time for some much needed tent yoga.","

I've been taking it slow. It was raining today. I woke up around 8am, which is when it started, so I kept sleeping for another few hours. Finally, I packed up and headed out since I was going to get wet wether I waited or not. The trail was slippery and steep all day. I fell several times. I decided to stay at the hostel in Andover. Quite frankly, I don't recommend stopping in Andover. I was desperate for some recovery time though. I went to the one restaurant in town and there were no vegan options, so I ate a quesadilla with cheese and veggies. It tasted good. I also had a side of fries...and Franky's fries and two salads. A $3 salad bar was hard to pass up! After that, I got a pumpkin cupcake and a molasses cookie to go and Franky got a piece of pie. I later ate all three of them. None were small either. I'm very ready for bed.","

I started on a 3 mile climb up, then after a terribly steep and painful descent, I went through Mahoosuc Notch, the ""hardest mile on the AT"". But honestly, the descent right before was harder. The notch was fun though! It's like a mile long boulder scramble. It would have been more fun without my 25lb pack. After the notch, I climbed 1.5 miles up and to the next shelter. I was moving so slow! My knees have been bothering me the past few days. This shelter I'm at tonight is really nice. I've truly been enjoying myself out here on the AT.

There are 7 SOBO hikers here tonight, which is a lot! I cleaned the cast iron burners [did you use soap ;P???] for my work-for-stay. It took about ten minutes.

It's really not though, it's sort of miserable...and windy. I had a rough time, mentally, starting my hike. The trail was all rocks and the weather, though mild for the Whites, felt extreme. Every now and then  a break in the clouds would appear for about 15 seconds and it looked like those commercials when things became "" claritin clear"". It wasn't long lasting, however.Mt. Washington is a joke. There's a cog that takes people straight up to the summit. It's tradition for hikers to moon the cog, I made sure to participate in this one :). I was so foggy, all of the sudden I hear the cog and instantly drop my shorts and stick my ass [I'm sorry Briana's mom, this is what she wrote...I'm just the messenger!] out towards the cog. It was quite liberating [says the girl who sends me paper farts 'cause she can't do it in person]. I sure hope at least a few of them saw my pasty cheeks. At the top of the mountain it's like a freaking theme park; flushing toilets, warm water, and a snack bar. There was a whole swarm of people by the summit sign, I didn't even go up to it. When I was in a bathroom stall, the lady next to me had open toed sandals with a french manicure. It was strange to go from a solitude hike in the clouds to a tourist trap, but I didn't mind the food and toilets. I've been hiking with a pretty large group of SOBOs recently. About a mile down from the summit, we were low enough for things to clear up and I could see more than the next cairen (rock towers along the trail) in front of me. We stopped by lake of the clouds, a hut 1.5 miles from the summit. They have a ""dungeon"" for the thru-hikers"" to stay in. The thing was hilariously terrible; 6 damp bunks in a tiny underground room. I'm so glad we weren't staying there! 5 miles later we reached the next where we decided to tent...we are like stray dogs hoping for handouts from the wealthy. When we were walking to the Ridgeline today, which was outstandingly beautiful BTW, the cloud's cleared from Mt. Washington. Buck made a comment about how we missed out on the view. ""the view is for paying customers only,"" I joked. It's a ruckus around here, a lot of flowing through the White Mountains.

I felt like the last thing in the world that I wanted to be doing was backpacking. Maybe it's all in my head. I need to get to a better state of mind. Spending al day walking up and down mountains with 25 pounds, day after day is a mental test. I miss being able to squat down without my knees hurting.  I also miss the comforts of home and fresh produce. I miss clean skin and towels and sheets that don't stick to me while I sleep.

I didn't take my pack off the whole way. After about 30 minutes I was completely soaked and loving it. I was stomping through puddles and hiking hard, I felt really strong. I didn't even fall behind the boys hiking. Eventually we reached Rutland VT around 11 and we made our way to the Yellow Deli. If you haven't heard of this place, Google it! Don't worry I didn't drink the Kool-aid. So its a restaurant and a hostel is upstairs. The food is awesome! All locally grown, there is so much I could stay. The boys have been at the bar for a while and they came back and dragged me across the street. We walked right into a venue with a reggae concert going on, hiker trash crashing a concert! That's what we were doing. It's so late for me. This place is cracking me up. The common room only has single chairs to prevent... fornication temptation I guess? Girls also sleep in different rooms than boys. I don't mind that, girls smell better!","

They serve a hikers breakfast at 7:30 for free and you can help them cook it if you want, so I did. All of their food is so good. As I was helping the boys peaked around the corner with guilty looks on their faces while sipping the Kool-aid. ""Not"" said Buck with his voice going up.Franky finished his sentence ""We want to stay another night.""I gave them a scolding look and shooed them away, secretly laughing. Eventually over breakfast, the 3 of us compromised on a 16 slackpack and return for another night. We had been invited to the ""Celebration"" on Friday nights, which we politely declined, but they were also offering food. So all of the hikers went, trying not to laugh or joke. They started the celebration by dancing in a circle and singing, some playing instruments.It was fun to watch. Eventually they offered tamborines which i excitedly took and started playing. After the dancing and the speech trying to suck us into the cult, we ate! I sat with a family that had two young girls. They were all over me all night talking, asking me questions, sitting on my lap, and doing my hair. It was kinda fun but I was excited to scoot out. I told them that I was tired and I walked out and went up the street where a Friday night town event was going on. I found the boys at an outdoor bar by the live music. ""Wow I needed this after that dinner."" I said to them. They laughed, such a weird day.","

And the 3rd, ""mine are still upstairs"". Buck overheard and started laughing at our conversation, but understood the joke. The girlto guy ratio on the trail is not even close to equal. I didn't realize how much I missed girls until I was around a few. When it was time to leave, the boys and I were having trouble getting a ride to the trail. I have a friend in the area who was working a booth  at the farmers market that morning for the Vermont 350 project. I went to the booth, right down from the Yellow Deli, but she wasn't there. I  told the people our situation and a really nice lady offered right away to take us! She was our saving grace. I tweaked a muscle in the right calf yesterday so I took hiking slow today.  Other than being a bit tired, it was a nice hike.  We are at a stealth camping spot by a river.

Luckily the trail hasn't been too challenging these days, so an easy walk is possible.Around 3 I made my way up the last climb for the day to find the boys waiting up top, a mysterious look in their eyes. At this point we had 3 miles downhill left and 3 hours before  we were supposed  to be in town to meet Scout for dinner. Atop of the mountain was a running ski lift. They wanted to ride on it. I shrugged and said sure. This is where I do something I have not yet done on the trail. We go down the 10 minute chair lift and we do not go back up. We yellow blazed 3 miles! I feel weird about that, but I sure didn't want to go back up the chair lift and hike more because getting off at the bottom, my calf had already cramped up. So after the boys got drinks at the restaurant below, we hitched into town.  Man, there's so many details I leave out because I would be writing  forever if I said everything.

I heard that the AT was inspired by that mountain...or something like that. It really wasn't much of a climb. Most of today was gradual uphill and it was muddy. I usually start to poop out around 10-15 miles, but when I push past that hard enough, eventually a second wind kicks in, that happened  to me on the last mile. I passed a lot of people hiking the long(?) trail today. This section of the AT is actually the same trail as the long trail. It's kind of funny to be around people who aren't thru-hikers. Buck, Franky, and I were saying how they remind us of what we were like in the 100 mile wilderness.My new shoes are breaking in pretty well, but 20 miles on new shoes was kind of rough today.The shelter I'm at tonight is pretty cute.

So Franky, Buck, and I went into Williamstown today and right across from the post office was a north face store! The lady who owned it was such an angel. I switched to a pair of 8.5 Salomon Mission 3. I love them so much! I'm so happy. While hiking, the boys were noticing that I was hiking stronger than usual. I felt amazing hiking in them today. It took us 3 hitches to get in and out of town. It was a fun side trip to our day's hike and afterward we hiked Mt. Greylock. We also passed ""half pint"" a lady who was doing some trail magic.

The three of us have a ""southbound salute"" we get on the side of the trail and cross our trekking poles in the air. It's sort of a sign of respect I suppose and the NOBOs really love it.

Holly, a friend of mine from college, took the boys and me in for the night/ It was so wonderful and I really enjoyed spending time with an old friend. I broke my no alcohol rule and brought some wine to her house because it felt wrong to show up without wine. We all have really been enjoying her and her family.
Going back to this morning, when I went to grab my food, a NOBO was standing by his hammock combing out his long white beard. It was just such a funny image. Speaking of which, I lost my comb and haven't brushed my hair in a week, but Holly hooked me up.","

We got to hiking around 8am. I thought that we had 17 miles to hike today and...to show how little I sometimes look at my map, when I got to upper goose pond, the boys told me that we had done 21 miles.
Upper goose pond is an amazing place! The shelter is more like a cabin and the bunks actually have mattresses. I went swimming in the lake with everyone right after I gave the blueberries to the caretaker. South-bounders are supposed to stop at the cookie lady's house and pick blueberries, which we did!

It also allows my body time to warm up and get loose. We eventually headed out  around 10, but Buck decided to stay and take a zero. It took Franky a while to part from the 3 golden retrievers that were at the cabin.
Today was a beautiful day to hike. My only complaints are the bugs. I was "" itchy and bitchy"" as Franky would say. I have a lot of  bites all over, even on my butt cheeks. I've even had an itchy bum hole today [I believe that's called swamp ass].  There's some things that are always funny in the woods; bum holes and poop related topics fall under that category [Briana... poop is always funny to you]. We can really get laughing about dumb things out here.
Halfway through the day there was a little snack shack along the way. Franky, Scout, Sheriff, and I stopped for a nice break. We are now ar a shelter with reports of bear activity.

I've also been having a lot of fun with Sheriff lately. I can really get to laughing around her. Today we hiked eleven miles into town. Scout and Sheriff and Scrunchy left before me. I started with just my tank top and shorts on, so I was hiking fast to stay warm. I zoomed past everyone and stayed warm through the uphills, but had to stop halfway through to layer up. I was chilly. We passed some Nobo's who were really dip wads today. They were playing music through a speaker really loud and they didn't say anything to me, but I heard that they yelled at Scout and Scrunchy and Sheriff that southbounders aren't really thru-hikers. Like....really guys, grow up and take off, what a bunch of losers. Most people on the trail are not like that.

Franky is going to Peach fest in a few days and has invited me. I'm not sure if I'll go. I want to, but Franky and I have been together since day one and we have both discussed hiking apart. Maybe it's time. I hate saying that because it 's so comfortable hiking around him. I guess we will see what happens. We've been getting on each others nerves a lot lately, especially with Buck no longer hiking with us. I will do fine either way, but I do know that hiking alone is lonely.

Once finished, I drove to an emergency care office where I peed in a cup and got some drugs for this UTI issue. Thank god because the whole time I was hiking today I felt like I needed to pee and it hurt every time I did pee.

I’m now cozy in the priest shelter with friends and a full belly. We are having fun looking through the “confessions log,” hikers are supposed to confess their hiker sins here. Pretty good stuff!

I stopped eight miles in at a shelter and ate, then I powered out fourteen miles without taking a break. A lot of what I hiked today was familiar, which was pretty cool.

After walking a long long long time in the cold rain, we came to long mountain wayside, a parking lot that I have driven to many a times. Here, franky Buck and Aloha and me waited for my good old friend Joe Malloy to come and pick us up. He has a little house that he uses for storage where he drove us for the night to stay dry. This house is funny! Pretty good sized with lots of beds. No hot water though sadly :/ but there is a really really old dryer that we are using to dry our stinky clothes. I hate to say this…but we are stinking the place up with our gear. Sorry Joe! It’s so nice to have a dry place to stay. It’s nice to be back in my stomping grounds. Joe brought us pizza for dinner which we devoured pretty quickly. Thanks Joe!

Oh, I also saw two baby bear cubs today!","

I have hiked everything that I hiked today previously, and it’s some of the best trail on the AT in my opinion. Bluff mountain was a big climb, but a nice climb. I remember taking seven days on a backpacking trip three years ago to hike what I just did in a day.

The boys found a stray dog earlier in the day and they hiked with the thing all the way into Glasgow. From there, the Sheriff came and got him. He was a pretty cool dog, though, we all enjoyed hiking with him.

To top off my amazingly perfect hiking day, I got picked up at the James River footbridge by Tasha. Tasha hiked the trail in 2004 and she is a great friend / role model of mine. I got to meet her 12 week old baby boy for the first time. We had a big healthy dinner where I put down some serious calories. I am so happy to be somewhere familiar. I’m looking forward to sleeping in a bed that I have slept in before. I love this family so much.","

I heard little indie waking up her parents as I lyaed around for another hour or so. This is, in a way, the closest thing to my own bed that I have. My parents just sold their house and I no longer live at college, so the trail truly is my home these days. When I need to put down an address, I usually look dumbfounded for a minute, contemplating which friend’s address I should use this time.

Breakfast is waiting for me when I make my way to the kitchen. They have so much going on in their lives, and they are still catering to me. I should be doing everything I can to help them out, but I’m not. I’m soaking it all in, a little overwhelmed. My life is so simple these days, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. All I really need to do is walk. Eventually we get the babies ready and Tasha and I head out. She drops me off at the trail after dropping off her daughter at daycare. I feel like crying as I head to the trail, but I don’t. I’m so happy to have spent time with Tasha, and upset because we forgot to get a picture with me and baby Van before heading out.

Since I didn’t start hiking with the boys today, I spent most of the day hiking alone, and that was quite nice. I really needed time to just be in my head. The weather was perfect and the trail was nice. Most of the day was spent climbing uphill. I took the day really slow and enjoyed taking my time. I fell good, really good, and I’m looking forward to taking a day off with my besty, Jessi, in a few days. It’s been a good day. At the very top of the climb, just past the tower thing, there was a short side trail to an amazing view. I took it and hung out with two day hikers. They sent me on my way with a bag of cherry tomatoes that were home grown and I meant to share them with the boys tonight…but I ate them all in less than a few minutes. Oh my gosh they were so amazing.","

I can eat so much shit and it doesn’t make any difference to my body. The second half of my hiking day was just as great as the first half. I feel like I can walk forever and never need to stop. My body is a machine. I feel incredibly strong…at least my legs, upper body not so much [Welcome to my life Briana].

Today has been cold, I ended the day in all of my layers. We hit MacAfee’s Knob at the end of the day on a Monday right before a big hurricane warning, so we got it mostly to ourselves which was nice. This place can be completely packed with hikers. As a thru-hiker, hitting a cool spot to find it flooding with day hikers is kind of annoying. We took our pictures and reminisced on how far we have come and how much we have left. Today is a special day because once we got down to the parking lot, my friend, Jessi, came to pick us up. All of my belongings are stored at her house, so it was strange to be reunited with my things. I put on clothes that I have not been carrying on my back for a month, and that was a bit strange, I feel as though I would just the same wear my backpacking clothes. I got kind of overwhelmed trying to go through everything. Tomorrow I need to get my next foot resupplies organized for her and switch out my gear for the rest of the trip and all of that jazz.

Frodo and I went to the library while we waited for the boys. I printed off my smoky mountain permit while there. We are staying with some friends of Scout and Frodo who live close to Roan Mountain. They were super sweet and cooked us a yummy dinner. I even got in a good game of chess before crashing out. I'm feeling better. We have a zero planned for tomorrow. I have been loving these easier days. I hope I wake up feeling good tomorrow.","

Today we are staying at a super 8. I got to take a really nice bath today and then I washed my socks and pack and food bag in the bathtub afterwards. The hotel charged us more than the hiker rate. They said that was only in the spring. Discriminating against south-bounders? oh well, i'm just happy to have a bed regardless. Tomorrow we hit the trail hard.

Wow, big day today. I didn't realize that we did 25 until I just looked at the map. We slack packed most of the day and Frodo brought us lunch halfway through. When we reached the top of a bald mountain, we found a group of kids and adults catching and tagging birds. It was pretty cool! I'm guessing that it was a school field trip teaming up with some environmentalists doing research. I secretly wished that I could be one of the kids holding and releasing the birds. It gets dark so early these days. Franky has been doing a good job at building fires lately. I've been enjoying having them every night. I'm feeling better, but not great. Under 200 miles to go for me. Hot Springs is coming up. I'm excited to go there. Frodo leaves tomorrow, so no more slack packing and being extremely spoiled. It's nice to be in the woods tonight. The temperature is nice and I'm excited to be in this nice shelter. Franky and a girl named Fire socks are here with me tonight.","

I finished my audio book today, Before We Were Yours. It has been excellent, sad but good. I'm in a shelter with Aloha, Franky, and 3 section hikers with a dog. It's a small shelter sadly. Tomorrow the weather is supposed to be nasty. We have 11 miles into Hot Springs. I have so few miles left, I really don't need to hike long days in the rain, but 11 miles is reasonable.  While hiking today, i started hearing a flute. It kind of weirded me out, just coming from the woods. It ended up just being an older lady playing a flute while hiking with her hubby. I love this little dog at the shelter. About 150 miles to go for me, then this girl is headed into the real world. I'm excited for beds and towels.","

I'm staying at this really cute hostel called Elmer's Sunnybank Inn. They serve vegetarian meals and I was pretty excited about that, though there isn't wifi or much phone service here. There's a pretty cool outfitter in town that had some great stuff that I would love. But I'm a backpacker, and all I could really buy was a fuel canister because that's all I need. Life of a thru-hiker. Weight weight weight. Not for long though. There's a music room in the hostel, and I picked up a guitar. My fingertips have lost their calluses and my upper body feels so weak.

It was a lovely breakfast and I enjoyed being around some new faces. I hit the trail a little after 9 am. It was uphill almost all day today. Luckily I had myself in the right state of mind, and I powered myself right up the elevation gain. I hiked by myself most of the day, and that was nice. It was a warm and damp day with the smell of fall thick in the air. There are so many smells involved with fall. The shelter tonight is really nice and quite large. it's supposed to rain tonight, so I'm happy for a shelter. I think I've only spent 3 nights in my own tent in the rain.

There are no flushing toilets which you think I wouldn't mind since I live in the woods, but if I'm paying for a place to stay, I want a toilet. I played some guitar with Scout and a guy working here. That was a good time. I may  get in a chess game tonight as well, which I am looking forward to. In the last town, I looked up some beginner chess strategies that I'm anxious to try. Tomorrow is another all day uphill, so wish me luck. I'm getting so close to the end. P.S.

They were uphill and long with no break, but after that it wasn't bad. I started a new audiobook today called A Dangerous Talent. It's about art forgery, but I'm not very far in so, I'm not quite sure what is going to happen, but I'm excited to have a new book to listen to.

My blog has been a mess since the beginning, but I've never missed a day. We woke up the usual, 7, 7:15 and hiked fifteen miles into where we were supposed to go into Gatlinburg. My morning was really nice, not that many people on the trail. It was a really beautiful morning, and then all the sudden about 5 miles from being done, we started seeing all of these people. It was pretty crazy. We were passing them, they were coming at us, they were just everywhere. So that was quite bizarre because that usually doesn't happen on the trail. Scout had arranged a shuttle that was prepaid to pick him up, and he invited Franky and I to come in with him. The guy was kind of an ass and charged franky and I $20 each for a fifteen minute car ride downhill that he wasn't expecting to even have join the shuttle, so that was just frustrating. Franky and I were annoyed because we could have hitched so easily with how many people were around, but oh well. Gatlinburg Tennessee is insane. There's like, its a tourist town and...it's crazy, it's like being at a theme park or something. So, we had quite a bit of fun there checking everything out, did some moonshine tasting, etc. We did the touristy thing and that was pretty fun, and we went to bed at 10 pm, which is super late for a hiker.","

I just felt like how I used to before the trail. Usually I feel sore and stiff from hiking. We got up and got rolling, went to dunkin doughnuts and this girl got herself some doughnuts, because I love doughnuts, however I'm going to have to cut myself off soon. About four more days of eating garbage, and then I have to cut back because I won't be hiking all day long everyday. So, we hit the town pretty hard today. We went to the aquarium and Ripley's believe it or not museum. We went to the arcade, and we won a Kavu bag in a claw machine which was pretty fun. We just had a great day.

I ran into two female thru-hikers today. Mona and Stumbalina. I actually met Stumbalina before way back in Massachusetts.  She was going north at the time.

I feel like blurting out that I only have one day left, but I don’t. I usually don’t say anything other than hello. I just hike. I’m good at hiking. It’s so easy. Uphill will always be challenging and downhill will always be annoying and flat will always be boring, but there’s nothing hard about hiking when it’s truly boiled down to footsteps. Yeah you have to make sure you have food and water and shelter, but that is all second nature. It’s nothing to worry about. Humans are meant to live like animals. We’re just extremely spoiled in our furnished homes and luxuries…well, some humans anyway. Not all are as fortunate to have nice homes and food and clean water. I am extremely lucky to be able to take time out of m life for a thru-hike.

When I reached the sign at Nantahala Outdoor Center that I stood at crying a little under five months ago, I didn’t know what to feel. I have walked everyday for almost half a year and now I guess I’m done. There’s no more for me to hike, at least not on the Appalachian Trail. I can go home now. 
 The hike into NOC was lovely this morning. I was emotional packing up this morning since it would be the last time. On top of me finishing my thru-hike today, it’s also Scout’s Birthday. I have been hiking with a card for the past few days. I gave it to him early this morning. It’s weird to be ending before all of my other friends. I don’t want to redo miles to Springer however; I’ve already done them. This is my journey, they just happen to be a part of it.
At an overlook, we ran into a big group of weekend backpackers. We talked and laughed and stayed up there for quite some time before I made my descent down to the river. Finishing felt quite anticlimactic. I just stopped walking and that was the end. 
I love the NOC. It was awake and lively when I walked over the bridge. There were tourists and water enthusiasts everywhere. People could tell that I was glowing about something, but they had no idea that I just finished hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail. I felt sort of empty. I don’t know how else to describe it. Empty emotionally as well as I was hungry! The three of us made our way to a restaurant and eventually Aloha, Funk Duck, and Mona joined us for evening celebrations. We had cake and drinks. It was a big celebration night for all of us. But even the celebrating didn’t keep me from thinking about what I was going to do next. 
I have not planned out the next steps of my life, but for now, that’s ok. I just need to be right here, wherever I am and no matter what I am doing, I just need to be right where I am. There’s no rush on anything because I can never put myself into the future or the past. If I find myself lost, all I need to do is open my eyes because I am where I am. 
As it turns out, putting one foot in front of the other is a successful tactic in finishing a thru-hike. So if you are looking for advice on your own journey, that is what I’ll tell you. It’s just one foot and then the other.","

Dot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580719,"Hi Friends! It's Dot. Yes, I have finally finished getting all of my blogs up to date! I hope you enjoy them. Also, please visit my YouTube channel for more trail videos! I love getting new subscribers. 
So what am I doing now? It took about a month, but I finally have made my way back to Idaho, but let me go back to the beginning of my post-trail experience. Since my car was conveniently waiting for me (thanks Red!) at the NOC, I didn't have to worry about getting home. I ended up slack packing my hiking friends for a few days as they continued. This was a fun way to slowly ease out of trail life. I brought them everything they needed and I was either hiking or running a few miles on the trail everyday. I didn't want to leave the AT. Eventually after a few days, I started to feel anxious and I said my final goodbyes to my hiking friends and started to head for Virginia. 
It took me two days to do the drive because I kept stopping in trail towns and I was even continuing to sleep in my tent. I wasn't very excited about seeing my friends in Virginia because I felt sort of like an animal. I couldn't remember how to do the civilization thing. I had arranged to stay with a good friend who worked at Sweet Briar College, where I went to school. I drove up the beautiful driveway to the school and I felt out of place. This had been my home for three years, but I no longer felt like I belonged there. I scampered up to my friend's office to get the keys, carefully avoiding as many people as I could. I woke up in a tent that morning and I looked like hell. 
I ended up running into a handful of people I knew. I nodded through the ""you're so skinny!"" comments and, ""wow, your all done!"" and ""was it life changing?"" questions. First off, I am the same weight as when I started, obviously I'm done, and of course it was life changing, but not in the way you think. Finally I made it to the office and my friend gave me her keys. She instructed me to go home, shower, and clean up. She has a beautiful house that is close to the AT and out of town. It was exactly what I needed. I stayed outside for a bit, playing with her dog and taking in the grassy fields and the mountains beyond. I feel like a piece of me now belonged to these mountains, and it is no small piece. I avoided my phone completely as I made my way inside. That night I ate dinner with my friend and we watched the new Wonder Woman movie...at least I think it was new. 
Time was moving slowly, everything about my life felt unfamiliar except for the woods. I woke up the next morning and I pulled weeds almost all day. The monotony felt very familiar and it felt good. That night, I took a big step towards reintegrating into the world, I shaved. I carefully bundled the hair of each stroke of the razor blade on the side of the tub. It took about three times around each leg to do the job. By the time I finished, my legs looked naked. I didn't like it at all.",,View Entry,"Oct 21, Sat",0

She even tried to give me nice clothes to wear, I politely refused...at least I think I was being polite. She went to the length of printing off twenty copies of my resume on resume paper. I wasn't even a week off trail and I felt like a monkey in a zoo headed off to try to find a job. I wasn't ready to see girls from School, but the van headed to Charlottesville was chuck full of girls that I knew. I was overwhelmed. I tried my best to be nice. All I wanted was to change into comfortable clothes and go galloping into the woods. I was completely off my game at the Job Fair. I don't even know what I want to do as a career next. I ended up talking to all of the education tables. I walked up and introduced myself, following with the line, ""and I just finished thru-hiking the AT."" The rest of the conversations were easy after that point. I made jokes about just shaving my legs for the first time and feeling overdressed and out of place. I would get asked a lot of questions about my experience, and then I would hand over my resume and go to the next table. Several people followed up with me, I even went and toured a school.

When we drove under an Appalachian Trail footbridge, I felt a serge of happiness. I remembered clearly crossing over that bridge a few months ago. We stayed with a friend of ours in Indiana, and when we got to Montana, we stayed with my brother, whom I haven't seen for a hot second. My brother is who started posting my blogs for me...but he failed miserably. We had a good time staying with him!

Right now I'm mostly just thinking about Thanksgiving tomorrow. I am doing better with my eating...I was eating like a monster the first few weeks off trail, but now that I've gained a few pounds and haven't been exercising as much, I'm getting in control of my diet. However, I am a little aggressive towards food. I eat really quickly, and I get kind of possessive. I'm working on it, turns out five months in the woods eating as much as you can all the time can really affect your eating habits. That's all for now.
