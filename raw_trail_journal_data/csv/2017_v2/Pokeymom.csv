Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551903,"I was given a FitBit for Mother's Day and began walking.My husband has talked about 'doing the A.T."" for 30 years....with a friend...when they both retired. My husband is retired....the friend isn't yet!We met Spirit (before that was her name) while bicycling TransAm in 2014 and talked about the A.T. She got the bug and completed the entire trail this year (2016). So I asked my husband when he was going and he said ""never""....????So.....long story short, I'm going to go instead! I am 68.....I feel like it is now or never!Let the planning begin!",,planning for Maine ,"Jun 01, Wed",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551908,"Today my husband drove me to Rockfish Gap for a short shakedown and the comedy of errors began.We parked at the Kiosk with the Skyline Drive/Blue Ridge Parkway map. The trail looked to parallel the BRP closely so I said my goodbyes and headed south and across the bridge over Rt. 250. I saw the white blazes for the first time!Then, just across the bridge I saw a double blaze.....double??? Somewhere in my brain I remembered it meant a turn. I looked left and across the guardrail...just a bunch of rocks to minimize erosion from road runoff. To the right.....the access road from Rt. 250 to the BRP. Neither made sense... the map showed the close parallel of the trail going south so I walked the edge of the BRP south! Dumb move! No blazes....no well-worn path.Fortunately Ted hadn't gone home because he came along the road and picked me up saying he didn't see where the A.T. crossed the road anywhere within a few miles. We drove to Humpback Rocks visitor center but it wasn't open yet. We drove back to Rt. 250 and, as we began again to drive up the access ramp to the Skyline Drive and the kiosk with the map I saw it.......stone steps just beyond the rock rubble I had seen!!!So....an hour after my start I started again, crossed the bridge and, at the double blaze I climbed over the guardrail and began the A.T. like I was supposed to!Ted walked a little of the way with me and we no more than started when we met two people coming north.... Raven and Free Bird. We chatted a good while and decided they would never finish their day and mine would never start at this rate!I was quickly on my own headed to the first shelter south with a pack that weighed way too much....about 38 lbs. including food for 3 days and 2 nights.I have a foot problem and have had it for around 15 years. After about a mile of walking (or less if my socks are tight or my shoes are tight) my feet begin to burn and quickly escalate to crippling pain in the ball of my foot. But, if I take my shoes off for a few minutes, my feet cool down and the pain never gets bad so....that is how my day went.....every mile I would stop and take my shoes off....and take off my pack.About a mile from the first shelter there is an old stone chimney and the remains of a foundation from a tiny house. I sat there with my shoes off when I heard a loud scraping sound and as I turned around I saw a bear coming down a tree behind me!!!! Fortunately the bear was more afraid of me and ran off. I put my shoes on and hoisted my pack into place and walked on.....talking loudly to the woods!And so I hiked and talked to the woods when, about 1/4 mile farther along and just beyond having made a hairpin turn, I heard loud rustling of leaves behind me! I just knew that bear was stalking me so I spoke up louder......as a man came hiking around the bend eyeing me cautiously....(how embarrassing!) I explained that I had just seen a bear and, I guess he decided I wasn't quite crazy after all.All that excitement caused me to snag my tent footprint on something and it fell off my pack! At the shelter and later that evening several Southbound hikers came by and said they had seen 3 bear cubs nearby.I met Bean who taught me how to use a bear pole and told me about a website (guthook) where I could download A.T. topo maps for a fee that was reasonable. Brother Raccoon and Lemon Lime arrived and brought my lost tent footprint....pretty nice of them since anyone carrying a pack really doesn't want to pick stuff up and carry more! They had met Spirit up in Vermont as she was headed north and remembered many details about her! Then they left because they were many miles from finishing their day. Two Tap, another SOBO (SouthBounder) arrived and spent the night at the shelter with Bean and me.",,Paul C. Wolfe Shelter first shakedown day 1,"Oct 27, Thu",5
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551932,"In my next life I will be a man.....Two Taps peed off the porch of the shelter while I got dressed warm and hiked to the outhouse (which seemed like 1/4 mile away at 12:30 a.m.!!!)True to my name, I was the last to pack up and leave in the morning. As I was leaving to hike south, several northbound section hikers arrived. Throughout the day numerous SOBOs passed me....Journey, Twirl, Kyle and others who's names I didn't catch.My plan was to hike to the Humpback Mountain campsite about 7 miles away. Ahh... the joy of planning at home! At about the 3 mile mark there was supposed to be a spring so I wasn't carrying very much water....but the spring was buried under fallen leaves and only slightly damp. Someone coming off the mountain and headed to the side trail nearby which went back to the parking lot took pity on me and gave me a bottle of water. Thanks again whomever you are!A mile later there was a good piped spring so I filled both bottles and the Sawyer squeeze bag....After all, the campsite was going to be at the top of the Mountain and no more water so I was planning for dinner and breakfast. I struggled just to stand up with the extra weight on my pack.....loud thoughts swirled around me telling me how crazy I was to even THINK I could hike anywhere!!!I made it about another half mile when I was overtaken (again) by another SOBO hiker who asked me if I knew where the water source was. He was disappointed when I said he had passed it but I offered to sit by his pack if he wanted to go back and fill his bottles. He thought a long time then decided he didn't want to backtrack. More day hikers were leaving the mountain and I talked one of them out of a water bottle for him.I didn't go more than another 1/2 mile seemingly straight up....and up many stone steps......AGAIN, I will be born a man next time WITH LONG LEGS...somebody made these ""steps"" giant sized. I gave up on a sharp switchback by a huge rock and a flat spot that had obviously been used as a campsite by someone else...set up the tent and cooked my noodle dinner then hung all the food up a tree.So people ask me ""aren't you afraid of wild animals?"" No but some people are a little freaky like the dude who passed by headed up the mountain just before dark.....He was tall, clean clothes, no pack, no water bottles, brand new suede workboots and MILES from any parking lot. He had a speech impediment so I couldn't understand him but instead I asked him if he had seen my husband ""back there""? He moved on......phew!At dark I was snug as a bug in a rug in my tent.....with my shortened hiking poles inside with me as ""protection"" from the strange dude if he came back!I quickly dozed off.....sheesh it was only about 6:30 p.m.!At 9:30 I heard a lot of leaf rustling coming closer.....adrenaline rush! Was it the freaky dude?????? Nope....just a group of 4 'normal hikers' coming down the mountain from (what sounded like a party up top). Back to sleep.....",,4.5 miles later first shakedown day 2,"Oct 28, Fri",6
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551933,"I slept like a baby and was awakened by the sounds of hikers passing about 8:30 a.m.I had a nice breakfast...packed up and headed back up the mountain again. My knees, hips, and elbows hurt....my pack weighs too much....it's the weekend and the trail is crowded with speedy day hikers....I feel old and feeble!I managed to contact Ted to let him know I was not going to make it all the way to our planned destination of Three Ridges Overlook....maybe we should meet at Dripping Rock? I struggled on.I contacted Ted again..... how about a nearer spot???? He suggested the Humpback rocks picnic area.........DEAL! A 3 mile day...yippee!About 2 miles into my snails-pace day Ted arrived! He actually met me just short of where I was planning to camp the previous night but didn't make it that far....he carried my pack out for me. Do I really think I can do this hike next year?????Well, the reason for a shakedown is to get rid of everything you don't need.... I'm making a list!",,first Shakedown day 3,"Oct 29, Sat",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551934,"I love the Columbia rain jacket but it is just too heavy...so I ordered a Marmot PreCip. I also ordered a second set of undies...need a second set while the other is being washed and dried! I know many of the hikers lessen their pack weight by eliminating them but I'm just not a 'go commando' person!! Thanks to Bean's educating of me, I eliminated some water purification parts, stocking cap (I have a really pretty silk scarf Dolly made when she was in college instead....and silk is remarkably warm!) I eliminated the thick tent footprint en exchange for a thin one. I also carried way too much food. It seems early on hiking doesn't cause much hunger.....that kicks in at about week 3 and then one can't get enough to eat!!! I am also considering eliminating my Whisperlite stove......but it sure is efficient (and heavy).",,elimination list,"Oct 30, Sun",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551939,"Got up at 5. Ted drove me all the way out to where Route 60 crosses the A.T. near Buena Vista. Technically this is milepost 806.1 on the A.T. The plan is to hike for 5 or 6 days to the Tye River Swing Bridge at Route 56 which is MP 831.5. Not very far in ""thru hiker"" terms as some of them can do that in one day! (will I ever?)   I'm not in it for the mileage yet.I was on the trail by 9. Ted walked with me for the first mile and then headed back to the car via a forest road. I continued up up up.....3 miles to the top and beyond.I walked into a fog which turned into a drizzle. Without a pack cover I was a little concerned that my 'stuff' might get wet so I used the tent footprint as a poncho of sorts just in case the rain increased. It didn't because pretty soon I was above the cloud looking at just mountain tops peeking above a white ocean.It was slow going. I ate lunch at the top but it wasn't quite the top after all. This day I saw absolutely no one and that was strange except that most SOBOs are gone farther south and this is a weekday. The sun came out and I was no longer in a strangely silent, damp and spooky world.I was headed to Cow Camp which is a .5 mile hike off the A.T. and I finally arrived at 3:15 p.m. There was a man soaking his feet in the stream where I was going to get my water to drink.....eeeewww! As it turned out, he was one of the people arriving at the Paul Wolfe Shelter on Oct. 28th as I was leaving there last week! He and a buddy were section hiking and camping beyond the shelter.....and his feet were below the actual spring source where I was going to get my water.I signed the much chewed-on-by-mice shelter journal and decided I would stay in my tent and not be eaten by hungry mice. I put my tent near the stream, filtered water for dinner and breakfast and settled in to the dinner routine. There was very poor cell service so I sent a text to Ted to let him know I was on track.Cell phones are handy....I can find my location on the maps but can't rely on the phone for much else.This shelter site is quite beautiful with the huge fire ring, picnic table, outhouse and a gurgling stream from the spring. Native Americans have used it for thousands of years.",,#2 Shakedown day 1,"Nov 01, Tue",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551942,"Would it be o.k. if I say I wish I was a man.....again? I drink water all day and it is a pain to be up several times each night to pee....men have an advantage.....I had a pleasant breakfast and decided to carry just one liter of water since this would be a short day to Hog Camp.....ah....the best laid plans.....Mistake #1...I had a choice to go 1/2 mile back up the mountain to the A.T. or follow the Hotel Trail. Both were supposed to go to Hog Camp. I chose to check out the Hotel Trail.That trail isn't in my book and didn't show up on my phone locator as a trail but it was wide and well used and ......off I went. Instead of going over the top of Cold Mountain, this trail circles around and fairly level.Mistake #2 Along the way I met 3 people headed to Cow Camp and they said they never did see any campsites along their hike.....I kept going.At one point the trail followed through some thick laurel bushes...pretty this time of year but when in bloom this spot must be stunning! Along the way the path crossed and followed some stone walls built in the 1800s to fence in hogs which is why the next camp is Hog Camp....duh.I arrived at an open meadow with some huge oak trees, several fire rings and thick moss. I don't know how the 3 people I met could have walked through here and not seen it as a campsite! Sure looked like a place to call home for the night for me!I went looking for water and found a damp spring about 1/4 mile beyond along the trail. I would benefit from a cut off water bottle or other kind of scoop to collect water in and then add to the squeeze bag of my Sawyer water filter for situations like this where you have to scoop out some mud to let the water collect in. I was really happily surprised at how this tiny filter system could turn muddy slimy yuk into pristine clear clean water that actually tasted great!I made a tiny campfire in one of the fire rings and was enjoying the solitude when 2 people walking dogs arrived and verified I was at Hog Camp (they were wrong but I didn't know that yet). I could, however, hear lots of people off in the distance.....didn't matter....I liked this campsite!",,#2 Shakedown day 2,"Nov 02, Wed",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551943,"During last evening I decided I needed to get moving earlier so I was up at 7 and on the trail by 8:30 today.I continued to follow the blue-blazed Hotel Trail back toward the A.T. and, having had it verified that I was at Hog Camp last night, the A.T. must be very near because the A.T. goes to Hog Camp......but that isn't where I spent the night and the A.T. was a good ways away!In fact, the A.T. didn't intersect with the Hotel Trail at all! I suddenly arrived at a parking lot where 2 forest roads met and where several other trails began and the only sign for the A.T. was pointing back the way I had come! Hmmmmm.....Out came the cell phone and found my location and, by zooming in I could see the parking lot and forest roads and....yes, off in the distance was the A.T. By zooming in tight and walking a few steps I could verify if I was taking the correct path toward the A.T. so I trudged along semi-bushwhacking to a real gravel road and, 1/2 mile later arrived at Hog Camp and the A.T.As nice as this huge meadow of campsites is, I had a much nicer one. Troll and his friend were heading south telling me they planned to do a few 25 mile days! They better hurry if they want to finish this year since the news is there is already snow in the N.C. mountains. Farther along were another SOBO couple with their colorful tattoos and piercings heading south. I met 2 more SOBOs on their 7th day out who said the next shelter was another 2 miles beyond the N. Piney River where I had planned to camp and suggested I push on to the shelter rather than camp at the river.As it turned out, the North Piney River really didn't have a decent place on the trail to camp. I later learned I would have had to take another side trail to find the actual campsite but the book I have didn't mention that so I passed on after filling my water bottles.About half-way to Elk Pond from there it began to drizzle so I decided to find a flat spot and camp. The hardest part of this camping spot was finding a good tree to hang my food bag from as none had limbs low enough for me to toss a line over. I found a dead one caught on another tree and decided that would have to do.I didn't dare cook. This site is so thick with dry leaves I would be afraid my stove would catch a leaf on fire and it would blow away before I could catch it. I have no desire to be in the middle of a forest fire. Again, with no cell service I tried to text Ted. 7 p.m. is hiker midnight and I am snug in my tent listening to the rain. The FitBit says I walked 10.7 miles today.....36,474 steps. But it counts distance by steps not GPS. In reality I hiked 7.8 miles today. Amazing actually!",,#2 Shakedown day 3,"Nov 03, Thu",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551944,"It rained hard off and on until about 2 a.m. but I was snug and dry. Then the wind howled for a couple of hours. At one point I heard a metallic ""clunk"" and just knew something had gotten my food bag and stove.I was up at 7:30 and on the move by 8:30 with no warm breakfast. It's cold and I didn't bring gloves and don't have extra socks for use as mittens...Brrrr. I never found what caused the metalic clink during the night . my food bag was untouched.I hiked about 1.5 miles to the Seeley Shelter where I had a warm breakfast of grits and hot chocolate. Nobody around....pretty place and peaceful....and out of the wind chill. There behind the front wall was a small bag and over by the sign in journal were some other items left behind by earlier hikers either by choice or accident. I checked out the little bag and inside was a battery backup. Wow! I put it in my pack and will find out if it was left because it doesn't work.While I was there Shakespear came for a short rest. He started in Maine but has been suffering from shinsplints. He has been off the trail for 6 days in Afton with a friend hoping to get better but he is in a hurry and I doubt he will be kind to himself. I hope he finishes.My plan.....there I go again....planning....was to camp at Spy Rock. Spy Rock is very popular with day hikers....noisy litterbugs. It is sad the day hikers don't look at their behavior more closely. Not all. Lots are careful but it only takes a few leaving a trail of toilet paper along the trail to make some areas unappealing. Anyway, Spy Rock was a very exposed camping area with nowhere to hide from the wind and it was COLD.I made dinner there but hiked on looking for a quiet flat spot. The next water source is 5 miles away so I needed to be careful of my water supply tonight and in the morning. I hiked on....and on.....and finally reached Cash Hollow forest road at MP 825 so I parked my tent on a grassy spot just off the edged go the dirt road and A.T. and went inside to thaw out and spend the night.",,#2 Shakedown day 4,"Nov 04, Fri",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551945,"At the crack of dawn a vehicle drove within inches of the tent....lesson? Don't park your tent on the edge of a forest road because they aren't abandoned roads! Someone was taking a shortcut to work I guess.
As it turns out I'm only about a mile from Crabtree Falls but the map makes it look like some very steep up and downs.....something I didn't want to face last night. Another 2 miles puts me on Priest Mountain at Priest Shelter. 
I had a nice warm breakfast and hit the trail before 9 a.m. and was quickly at the forest road leading to The Meadows camping area and Crabtree Falls so I went that way. 
The road is well used but without really high clearance its a rough one. One suv was parked at the A.T. crossing but a short way from there it left gouges on a rock and skid marks. Hope the car works when the owners return!
There were lots of campers in pickups sitting around blazing campfires (it's awfully dry and the fallen leaves are thick...makes me nervous). At The Meadows parking lot the flat roadbed trail to the top of Crabtree Falls begins and continues about a mile.
I hiked down the whole 1.7 miles of the falls because some nice people who were camping at the Meadows offered to return me to the Meadows parking lot if I wanted to hike down the falls to the parking lot at the bottom of the falls where they were parked......I took them up on the offer.
After returning to the Meadows I hiked back up to the A.T. with plans to stay at Priest Shelter but it was packed with weekenders, partiers and barking dogs! I hiked on looking for a flat spot.....and over the top.....and down down down......finding a passable spot and crashed for the night! Cold and tired!
No cell service but I tried a text to Ted. He's going to meet me at the bridge tomorrow at noon.",,#2 Shakedown day 5,"Nov 05, Sat",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551946,"There were still plenty of people on the trail even after dark and at one point around 1:30 a.m. some partiers discovered my food bag hanging and made some comments. I was sure they would just take it but they didn't. Thank you!As on my first shakedown....it isn't the bears you have to keep an eye on!I tossed and turned and listened to the yappy dogs....yelled a few times but I am sure no one heard me. Sometime in the wee hours the dog stopped....maybe some other camper strangled it? Maybe it just got a sore throat and quit. I swear that dog didn't breathe between yaps!Got up at 6:30 and on the trail by 7:15 heading off the mountain. It's a 4 mile downhill but I was quite suddenly at the bottom and the parking lot...and Ted wouldn't be there until noon!I walked across the road to the swing bridge and across the Tye River. There was a pretty campsite there so I made breakfast and filtered more water. While I was eating someone called ""Pokeymom...is that you?"" It was Bean from my first night out on the first shakedown! She joined me and caught me up on various hikers. She had also been off the trail for a knee tweek but was improved.While we were talking I heard the ""beep"" of a car being locked using the electronics on the key and said to Bean ""that sounds just like my car"" but it was only about 9 a.m. Then I heard another ""beep"" and said ""I guess they all sound alike!""Shortly we went across to the parking lot to meet Ted and Bean had decided to accept a car ride to the base of Crabtree Falls so she could hike up there and back to the A.T. As we crossed the bridge we saw our car was already there but Ted wasn't in it....the ""beep"" we had heard was actually our car after all and Ted was really really early!!I asked all the hikers passing through and up the mountain to send Ted back. He had hiked up with 'brunch' to surprise me.....so sweet but....he hiked for about 3 miles up (and 3 miles back down!) while I just sat waiting for him.We dropped Bean off at Crabtree and headed home.I still have to refine my pack but this was much easier that the first shakedown.

Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551970,"First I want to thank all those who have written to me. I hope to eventually meet each and every one of you along the trail.You may be starting later than I will but that doesn't mean we won't meet as you pass me!I have a question for those reading these blogs and for those who write on them.When you write about ""pack weight"" how do you measure it? When I do, I weigh myself naked then put on the clothes and shoes I will wear plus the pack and poles and food and weigh again. That way whatever the difference is becomes my ""pack weight""......after all, much of what I have on may end up inside the pack and even if it doesn't, it all adds up to how much more my pitiful feet will be carrying!!! So when I read about 14 or 19 pounds I wonder if, for me to get to that number, I perhaps need to hike naked and without food or water!!! Nobody wants to see that happen!!!!!",,so many contacts already!,"Nov 29, Tue",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552048,"I cannot say I am surprised to have heard from The Conservancy about any thru-hiker plans I have for next year. Anyone who has voluntarily signed up for a start date has likely gotten the same email.The email advises that 70 miles of the A.T. are currently closed in Georgia and describes the location as well as that ALL of the Great Smoky Mt. National Park is also closed for 71 miles....""the A.T. will not reopen until the US Forest Service or NPS says it is safe, and we have no current prediction when that might occur"".It continues with ""It is quite possible that some sections will still be closed when you begin your thru-hike, so you should be prepared to skip around closed A.T. sections"".My guess is that means the dead, leaning or fallen trees along or on the trail will need to be ""made harmless"" before the trail opens again. My experience with state and national parks in the past is that after severe storms they close until dangerous dangling branches and leaning trees are no longer a threat to campers and hikers. Thank you to the park service and volunteers for watching out for us but that doesn't preclude our personal responsibility to LOOK UP now and then and take some of our own precautions!!! Hiking the A.T. is, at the very least, a challenging experience for which each of us need to take serious precautions and responsibility for being out there! (It isn't a walk in your back yard... the arborist wasn't there last week to make the path pristine.)Not surprisingly, the fire danger remains high and is predicted to continue into at least February of next year. All campfires are banned from Georgia to Front Royal, VA......camping stove styles are also specifically listed according to what is prohibited.....no alcohol, hexamine or solid fuel cube stoves are allowed. (Dang.... there goes my plan for taking the homemade super-light-weight one and returning the heavy one to REI! On the other hand, I have said before that I REALLY like that stove..... just not the weight of it. I guess it remains in my pack!)My heart goes out to those who haven't finished their SOBO hike yet...Bean, Shakespeare, Troll, Twirl, Lemon Lime, Brother Raccoon and the many others I met who's names I have already lost.... I know the A.T. will credit you with a ""thru-hike"" even if you couldn't complete it because of closures but it won't be the same in your minds. Brother Raccoon particularly comes to mind since he very purposefully backtracked to the point of the trail exactly where he left it to come to a shelter so he wouldn't miss hiking EVERY INCH of the trail. Not every hiker has the freedom to come back next year and fill in the inches or miles......So when and where will I start? Rethinking......again!",,The fires and 2017 plans,"Dec 02, Fri",0
Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552109,"I have a camel back but it just I am afraid it might leak. Sure, the pack has a special ""totally waterproof"" section for it but..... Also, I just can't imagine trying to fill it because I would have to totally unload the pack, remove the bladder, filter the water into something else and then transfer it into the bladder......and it doesn't hold much. soooooo.....I have been trying to figure out how I can make a simpler one and have found the perfect solution. I am using 2 one-liter ""smart water"" water bottles with those funny caps that have a drinking hole under the cap. I found that the aquarium air hose is a perfect fit into the drinking hole and I can thread it onto my pack strap AND I ""rescued"" the bite end off another platypus style bag which also fits on the aquarium hose. The fit into the bottle isn't so tight that it won't leak if I stand on my head while wearing the pack but I don't plan on hiking the trail doing handstands and a leak outside the pack is acceptable.Now I don't have to take my pack off just to get my water bottle out of it's pocket and put it back again. I don't know who designed these backpacks but every one I tried requires a contortionist to be wearing it if I want to get a drink of water while walking.Big Agnes sent me a liner for my sleeping bag that is supposed to add up to 15 degrees.   I guess I'll be sleeping out in the yard again this weekend when the temperature drops into the 20s again.

Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552501,"Today the wind was blowing a gale and the temperature didn't rise above freezing so it seemed like a good day to see what it would be like to hike and camp out.I went for an ""around the farm"" packed hike for 4 miles and damned near froze! By 2 p.m. I was dreaming of a toasty house and a long winter's nap so I went home and did exactly that....took a nice nap which took forever to get some body heat back. Under flannel sheets and down comforter I was still not warm an hour later.A couple cups of hot chocolate and I went outside again. My husband, Ted, packed some charcoal, lighter and a hibachi onto the golf cart and gave me a ride the 1/2 mile to the pond. While he got a protected fire started, I set up the tent and got everything set up to cook a trail style dinner. He wasn't interested in my concoction of a meal so he headed back to the house leaving me to deal with impending darkness and below freezing temperatures. He was the smart one!My dinner was nothing to brag about but I ate it. I tried to enjoy the fire but decided I would be better off getting into the sleeping bag before I was chilled through.It was a restless night. I slept in short spurts and rearranged my sleeping attire several times ending up with my feet in the sleeves of my down jacket... I need down booties......back to the sewing machine in my dreams! Eventually the full moon came up, I had thawed out so I braved the 15 degree temp. and went out to admire the moon over the freezing pond and stirred up the hibachi fire. When I went back to the Marmot zero degree bag I wasn't as cold and found the bag to be a big improvement over the earlier one.Eventually morning arrived but in the short time it took me to pack up everything including a thoroughly frosted tent, my fingers and toes were beyond painfully cold. Then a little miracle happened...Ted arrived with the golf cart to see if I had frozen to death and I hitched a ride back to the house wondering if I would actually survive out on the A.T. Maybe I should start in May instead of February?????By the time I thawed out again and sent a few texts to my friend Spirit of 76 who completed the A.T. this year, I felt better and more confident again. As she reminded me, her experience with the cold was ""walk faster and you'll thaw out"" and to remember that the mountains in Georgia will have a cold day followed by a not-so-cold day.

There is a campfire ban but it seemed my neighbors around the corner claimed they had ""special permission"" and built a bonfire....at least it didn't get away during the night.

At 11:30 I finally got to the top of Blood Mountain and the most beautiful stone shelter and excellent cell service for calls home and to other loved ones. The clouds rolled in and the snow began to fall as I made a hot lunch and silly rallied until 1 p.m.
Day hikers, young college kids, a 3-some of middle agers visited the area when I was there.the snow stopped...sleet and freezing rain took its place. Dressed in my gear I headed out as Longlegs arrived dressed in a garbage bag skirt...I said we would work out a fix at the hostel tonight.
I saved a little of my water and dumped the rest....2 miles or so of downhill and I would be done...no need for the extra weight.
Going down this side of Blood Mountain sure makes meq glad I am a NOBO.  It is purely rocks.  I'm just thankful they are lumpy enough that my Merrills grab hold.  Sleet, freezing rain then just rain but I am dry and toasty .  My gloves are covered with homemade gauntlet length plastic tucked up into my sleeves.  The rain jacket works but the skirt is too billowy and I can't see my feet....a good reason to share half of it with Longlegs....so back in the pocket it goes.  The waterproofing on my pants doesn't do much but the fleece under them keeps me warm and dry.
A beautiful young lady from Switzerland passed wearing a bright orange poncho over everything....a modern day Hunchback of Notra Dame!  She went out of sight as I carefully picked my way through the rocks and stone steps.  A few minutes later she reappeared coming back up the slippery mess.  She said she lost sight of me and got worried that I had fallen!  That was something I never would have expected anyone to do!!!
I explained that my name is Pokeymom for good reason and assured her I had a whistle and would be very careful so she could hike on without worry and thanked her profusely.
I arrived at Mountain Crossing Outfitter and hostel in Neel Gap around 4 and got a bunk.  As I walked in the door I was greeted by the many who had passed me....""Pokeymom made it!!!""
Through the wall came a voice from an earlier shelter....""I am being careful not to pee on the toilet seat.....""   I told him he had a trail name now...Sprinkle.... He wouldn't have to explain...could even mean cupcake decorations but he had let the cat out of the bag to everyone himself.
The hostel has a lounge and kitchen and bunk room.  In the bunk room I asked if there was a bottom bunk available.  They were all taken....until the gal from Switzerland said I could have hers! There she was again...my guardian angel!
It was hot in there with electric oil radiators and a dehumidifier.  I quickly went from feeling cool and soggy to warm and wrinkled.
The shower was outstanding as was the company of these delightful and friendly bunch of people.
Longlegs was there but between the Two of us we couldn't figure out how to make my rain skirt into two without a sewing machine. He bought a piece of tyvex at the outfitter and we created a skirt for him that, when used inside out doubled as a hitchhiker sign!","Woods Hole junction

Sprinkle was up crashing around in the dark packing his laptop so he could take off at 6. Others grumbled and began to stir and by 8 everyone was up sand packing.
I was chatting to No Name who was getting a shuttle to Top Of Georgia.  He is getting a cold and is trying to finish last year's hike by doing the 80 miles he missed when the trails closed for the fires.
The weather was pea soup fog and drizzle with serious rain due tomorrow.   I asked if I could stay a second night...let this crowd move ahead and recuperate a day but was refused space so I joined No Name and shuttled with him splitting the fee.
Our driver was a great guy full of stories...part Native American....named Alpine.  He has hiked the trail and was a former Blackwater employee having trained at Camp A. P.

Probably the only time in your life when you can eat anything you want and lose weight.....the catch?  Whatever you want you have to carry on your back for several days and cook in one pot with water you have filtered from a stream and carried along.  Inconvenient?

The others packed up and moved north....even the tent I thought was vacant is gone.
About noon 2 hikers passed headed up the road I will take tomorrow.
Soon after the rain arrived with some serious plans.  I'm staying snug and reading with a big mug of hot chocolate.  I could say you should envy my situation....no deadline...no pressure to move.....but I stink and my hands are gross and my fingernails are trashed.  Well, nobody said this was an aroma or beauty contest.  Tomorrow afternoon I will be a new person.
For late afternoon meal I filtered water into the cook pot, added a mystery mix,of noodles, dehydrated veggies from the garden and a tomato bullion cube....Set it on the stove and instantly realized I hadn't removed the foam sleeve from the cup....melting it to the smell of burned tires...but not beyond use.  
Heads up GSI!!!! Gray stuff is nice in all this dirt and mud but maybe the sleeve for the pot needs an orange or flashy green stripe to remind dummies like myself to remove it before cooking!!!!
My mystery meal was quite tasty....surprise!
A noisy bunch passed out of sight and up the trail to Standing Indian shelter.  Out of sight is easy since I can barely see the nearest tree for the did that has been socked in all day.  Question....how can the wind howl through the treetops but the fog stays put.??
I am nearly finished my 3rd book since starting out.  I think there are about 20 more on the Kindle.....still...I want a better day tomorrow!

Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555944,"The rain stopped at 4 a.m. and the winds I heard in the trees came into the gully I'm camped in.  Brrrr.  I'm not cold except my nose.At 7 I was awake...dressed in most everything by 7:30.  The thermometer says 26!. ..and still windy.  Already 2 sets of hikers have come through. I'm a softy and still not out of the Pokey Palace.  At least the tent is mostly dry outside for packing up.At 8:30 The sun came out while I was having a warm breakfast of hot chocolate and oatmeal seasoned with a big hand full of trail mix...yummy!
Packed up and headed out the 4.5 miles to the highway along the forest service road that is closed until April 1. This is the best maintained, nearly pothole free, compacted gravel road! Along it's length are springs and streams and campsites galore!
When I got to the road I had no cell signal so I stuck out my thumb anticipating the rapid ride from hiker friendly motorists. Vehicle #51 and a near hour later....arrived.
The driver has never been on the trail but he gives hikers rides and even stopped for 2 more at Winding Stair Gap. He dropped all of us at Havens Budget Inn Hostel. As I was leaving, 4 hikes ran up to me yelling ""Pokeymom""... You made it!!! Then 3 more arrived by shuttle including Beast (Rebecca)!
I have a room to myself and after a call home I think I have finished my journey.","Deep Gap

Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555949,"It will take 2 days to drive home...and go back for the 2 food/clothing boxes at NOC and Fontana Dam. I am a little sad to leave the trail but have learned so much.It was never about 2200 miles.....it was never about standing atop Khatadin in Maine......though it would have been great to do that too!
I was never a purist who has to see every white blaze.
I wanted to experience the trail. Meet the people...see what I was made of!!!
Conclusion? I am a wimpy slow fair-weather hiker. I'm friendly and cheerful and cautious of my foot placement to the point of extreme low mileage.
I had no aches or pains or blisters or falls....although I did start with bronchitis which is still lingering around the edges.
I carried too much food and too much weight but used everything I brought and was comfortable.
Most of all...
REGARDLESS OF THE NEWS....ALL THE BAD STUFF THAT IS ATTENTION-GETTING......
THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL, WHOLESOME, POSITIVE, HELPFUL, KIND AND GENEROUS AND CARING POPULATION OUT THERE....I THINK THEY ARE ON THE A. T. HEADING SOMEWHERE BEAUTIFUL.
MAY THE JOY STAY WITH EACH OF YOU.","Franklin

Pokeymom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563318,"I have been off the trail for way too long and now have an opportunity to repay some of the kindness I experienced during that first 100 miles.Today I hope to arrive at Rockbridge Gap to pass out some trail magic and hope to see some people I met back in February and early March before I had to leave the trail.Look for me today (Saturday)  at the Kiosk across the Route 250 bridge at the end of the Blue Ridge Parkway and beginning of the Skyline Drive around 10 or 11 a.m. today and earlier (I hope) on Sunday morning.For those who may be wondering......I got off the trail thinking I wasn't over the bronchitis I started my hike with.  As it turns out, the bronchitis was gone but I discovered I had developed a bad case of sciatica from piriformis muscle issues and have been through some acupuncture which didn't help, chiropractics which did help the sciatica (because I also had a spine issue I didn't realize I had), an MRI, and now am in physical therapy and soon to see another doctor!  It doesn't look favorable that I will return to the trail in any form except as an occasional trail angel giving out some magic!  Even at that, it is nearly a 3 hour drive from home to be out there since I don't live close to the trail.  I had hoped to make a trip to Damascus for Trail Days hoping to see some hikers I met during my (all too short) adventure but I don't think I can tolerate that much walking around yet.Although I may never return to hike the AT, I would encourage anyone and everyone to get out there and give it a try...........a fantastic experience in itself and in the company of some of the nicest people I have ever met!Happy trails to all of you out there.  Say ""hello"" to the final mountain for me!","Kiosk at Rockbridge Gap dispensing trail magic!
