B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556766,"Starting a journal is like starting a conversation. Where to begin.....I've never been the outdoorsy type. The adventure stories I've enjoyed over the years have been the Journals of Lewis and Clark, Private Yankee Doodle (autobiography of a Revolutionary War soldier), A Walk in the Woods, Lord of the Rings, and some of the Greek Mythologies. Yeah I know thats weird, but hey its my weird and I keep it under control. Common theme in all of this to me is the unknown adventure and discovering the true nature of people.Why the AT? And why now? I'll answer these and maybe more than you wanted to know in the next posts.",,First Step,"Mar 17, Fri",0
B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556799,"The PilgrimNo not that kind.This Journal is a way for me to include my friends and family in my Appalachian Trail Pilgrimage. My journey of 2190 miles from Northern Georgia to Mt. Kathahdin in Maine - or if you prefer five million steps, starts on April 13, 2017. Logistically, if I can average close to 15 miles a day I should be able to finish in five months.No I won't be alone - I'll have you guys reading this journal and over 2000 people attempting this pilgrimage with me - granted only 25% Pilgrims make it the whole way. Dropping out for various personal or physical reasons, from family needs to mangled feet.No I won't be carrying enough food for the entire trail. The trail is a footpath designed and built during the depression, connecting National Parks, State Parks, Public Forests or public lands. Sometimes it has to go through a town or cross a highway. So there are re-supply stops along the way.My journal will not be wordy - its just not me, and frankly I don't want the burden of HAVING to write something everyday or like a report a boss needs every week. I hope to make this journey something I (emphasis on I) can look back on and go, oh yeah, and laugh.I'm middle aged (if I live to 108), married to a wonderful woman (actually she's a saint for letting me leave her to manage the home front for six months while I go walking in the woods). We have raised two terrific kids, really my best work. I've worked with some great people I consider friends and hope their comments about this journey are kept PG rated. You know who you are!You may ask why leave a comfortable home, a loving wife, and a great job? Well...because it's a challenge in life I've always dreamt about. From the Journals of Lewis and Clark to Homers Odyssey -the adventure is not the destination - its the JOURNEY. To test one's metal - not just physically but mentally. Hard to get that sitting behind a desk in front of a computer wearing your Scooby Doo's!So why call this a Pilgrimage - I'm looking at this as a way to do some soul searching, that thing in Life that one can look back over their life and say I DID IT. I'm a Bad Ass. Oh, not saying my life has been bad, far from it. I've been truly blessed by God my entire life. It's just time for Bill's Epic Adventure.So, lets get this ball rolling...also no cliche's. I promise thats the last one! I've worked with enough bosses to write a book on stupid one liners.",,From the couch to the trail,"Mar 18, Sat",0
B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557545,"Well, its done! Asked the boss for a six month leave of absence. Not sure which is more disturbing: a) the rejection of my request, or b) being asked to resign if I wanted to pursue my dream. The email informing them of my decision wasn't quite as rewarding as I wanted it to be. Telling your boss to take this job and shove it, just sounds like fun, till you get to the point its time to do it. I enjoyed most of the work I did, there were plenty of good people to work with and a few ...well lets just say idiots.

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560165,"Friends and Family - First trail entry and I'm breaking more than one promise. Number one - I promised short entries - so as to not bore you or to become tedious for me. Number two - read on for the other break....Tuesday 4/11 - Trinda (wife) and I left the house early to drop off three re-supply boxes in towns I will be passing through. Fontana Dam, Nantahala Outdoor Center (the NOC), and Hiawassee. Beautiful drive, but quite curvy.The road may have slowed my speed but not my enthusiasm. Arrived at Neel Gap and checked into Blood Mountain Cabins. Met a couple through hiking from Michigan along with Klaus from Germany (packing in at 46 pounds ouch) In comparison my pack is at 26 pounds with four days of food for both the wife and myself - does not include water)Wednesday 4/12 - The plan is for us to park our car at Neel Gap - shuttle to Springer Mtn - then hike the 31 miles back to our car, where Trinda will drive home and I'll continue north to Maine. Well, at least thats the plan. At 7:00 am met our shuttle driver Alpine (thats his trail name - he is a volunteer Search and Rescue - super nice guy) - he explained he had several other appointments that day and was in quite a hurry - so we loaded our packs and off we go. Twenty minutes later I realize our trekking poles are in the trunk back at the car. Due to Alpine's schedule he could not get us back to the car and Springer in time to honor his other commitments. So I figured we could improvise walking sticks from some down limbs.By 8:15 we were on the trail. Well sort of, the drop off point is a mile down the trail. So for the purist in me, I hiked back up the trail one mile, signed the register at Springer and hiked back down the trail. Technically that doesn't count for AT mileage, but I hiked an extra mile just for my pride. The trail was not technical at all and we made good time. Stopped a couple of times to take in the views had a short lunch and got to Hawk Mtn Shelter by 2:30 - way earlier than I expected. So we decided to press on for another 2 to 3 miles. By 4:30 we selected a so-so site about half a mile short of Horse Gap. Set up camp and was prepping the Bear-Bag hang (fyi- this is hanging your food from a tree somewhere around 200 ft from your camp, high enough a bear can't reach it). I've got my rock bag and string to throw up to a perfect limb...lets just say I'm glad no one was there to video this. Ive probably hung a bear bag 30 or 40 times - but for some reason the line kept getting snagged by some undergrowth and then it started to rain - after the fourth attempt I slipped falling backwards - I landed with a pretty powerful blow on my left hand snapping my wrist. I gave up - went back to the tent thinking this might just be a sprain. But after Trinda looked at it she thought better of waiting to the next day, made a couple of calls to get a shuttle and found one who could pick us up at the gap in 45 minutes. Packed up the camp and hiked the half mile to meet him. We got back to our car and onto the ER in Blairsville, GA by 7:00. No real pain, unless i tried to use my fingers or twist my hand. X-rays spoiled my hopes - there were several fractures, the Dr. suggested a visit to an Orthopedic Surgeon. DAMN! We finally arrived home at 2:30am and I still had too much adrenaline to sleep. I was so so disappointed in myself. The last time I broke any bone was my ankle in 1981 - and I knew how long that took to recover from - so I'm trying to resolve myself to the hike is over for this year.Thursday 4/13 - After two or three calls trying to find a Surgeon who would see me on short notice, TN Orthopedics asked me a ton of questions (unlike everybody else I had called) and asked me to come in at 2:00! I cleaned up the best i could (still had yesterday's funk and dirt all over me) and got myself down there. Beau Cassidy (NP) was very sympathetic to my wishes to get re-built and back out as quick as possible - looking at my wrist the swelling had subsided pretty good with little visible bruising, he felt there would be no issues. After looking at the x-rays his opinion changed and suggested surgery on Monday was my only option with pins and a plate. He said Dr Roy Terry would review and if I didn't mind waiting he would try to carve out a minute to see me. Did I mind? Hell No! Doc came in and right off I could tell he was on TEAM B-SQUARED. He asked if we could do the surgery Friday 4/14 (Good Friday) and he explained his plan to get me patched up and possibly back on the trail in two weeks. His trail name is now FastDoc...but I'm leaning toward the Godfather - for making this happen so quickly.Friday 4/14 - got to outpatient services at 11:30 and it seemed everyone there knew my situation and was expediting all the services to move me through this temporary setback! I felt like a Rockstar. Surgery at 2:00 and I was in recovery before 3:00 - see picture for nurse humor - Doc said it went well and to call his office on Monday for further instructions.I can't brag enough on everybody that has helped me through these past few days and I hope you will stay with me as I get recovered and back ""on the trail again"".","Springer Mtn

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562987,"After a visit toÂ Doc Terry on 4/27 (I've officially given him the trail name The Godfather, for working me in and getting me back on the trail so fast), Trinda and I started 6 miles down from where the accident, at Gooch Mtn, just to give us time to hike for two days and get her back to work on Monday. So the trail was not technically challenging, but we wanted to ease into it. We got to Lance Creek, set up tent next to Bruno, what a character, and a group of three boys with their fathers practicing for their Boy Scout retreat at Philmont. Weather was fine till just after we set up tent, ate and hung up food bag. Then a pretty bad storm hit, I say pretty bad - in your nice cozy home you wouldn't think anything about it - but we had 30 to 40 mph winds, tons of rain and marble size hail. It was a challenge to stay dry, but the tent worked great. Sound of rain on tent was extremely relaxing.","Gooch Gap
",Lance Creek,"Apr 29, Sat",7.10
B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562988,"Woke to a foggy and windy morning, so the water dropping fromÂ the leaves made itÂ feel like it was still raining. Packed up wet tent and headed to Bllod Mtn. Just past Lance Creek to Blood Mtn requires a bear canister- hard plastic tube that bears can't break into - we saw no bears!
Blood Mtn is the highest point on the AT in GA (4457'), unfortunately with the fog no view, unless you like looking at fog. There is a shelter at the peak, oldest shelter on the trail - built by the CCC in 1934. As we headed down the clouds started to break, but alas only view we had was of the wet rocks in front of our feet. I checked the phone to see if we could get a shuttle back to our car for Trinda, but we had missed it by an hour. We were at NeelGap and Mtn Crossing Outfitters - the AT actually goes right through this store, and not having any luck contacting any shuttle drivers. Friends, I have never tried to be a pest to others, but I was looking for a ride and running out of time. After about an hour I got lucky asking this couple just leaving the store. Sweet T and Smiley had driven down from Helen to buy Smiley a new pack and Sweet T was taking him back up the trail. These two were our Trail Angels today- they drove us about 14 miles out of their way and would not take any moneybags for their troubles!
Trinda left - still kind of emotional about this as I write it now four days later. And I stayed the night at the Hiker Hostel in a bunk bed - dry and snug as a bug, ready to meet the rest of my journey all alone.Â 
Two great guys at the hostel shared their pizzas with me (Andre & Mike - thank you for the pizza, but more importantly thank you for your service in Iraq and Afghanistan)","Lance Creek
",Neel Gap,"Apr 30, Sun",7.30
B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562991,"I had a late start out of Neel Gap, fortunately, as it was another doozy storm in the morning. Shuttle got me to Neel at 12:45, the rain had stopped, but the wind felt like it was either pushing me backwards down the trail or over a cliff. About 3 miles in I passed a fellow with a huge pack (70 pounds - ouch) I weighed mine as I left the hostel - including a liter and half of water and three days worth of food I was at 25 pounds, pretty happy with that, but would rather be at 20. They say we pack our fears - mine is being wet and cold.Â 
Met Martin or Lone Woof - doing a section hike. He started at Springer and wants to go as far as he can by Saturday, then fly home to Dallas. We hiked together for about 7 miles, he was a tad faster than me, I'm not in as good a shape as I thought or wanted to be. Middle TN hills are no comparison to these mountains. I was told on aÂ scale of 1-10 for the AT-GA mountains are a 4....damn I sure hope I get my hiker legs soon.Â 
Set up the hammock to a dry but WINDY night, I'm just glad we were on the leeward side of the Gap. I could hear the wind up above us, but not blowing through my tarp. A lady tenting next to me was telling us how concerned she was because the low temp was predicted in the 40's. Let me tell you if the local forecast is 40, then the temp in the Mtn will be 10 degrees cooler, depending on elevation. I lent her my puffy jacket, because she didn't have a sleeping bag, just a fleece bag liner. Imagine a huge towel and sleeping in that. In the morning she was so glad I could help her. Not sure that was much help, but I tried.","Neel Gap

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563000,"So when I post mileage, it's actual trail miles. It doesn't include going off the trail for water or to a shelter or a view.Â 
Three of us,Â Mark, Abbie (trail name Soul Keeper) and myself startedÂ out together this morning at 9:15 after jointly making arrangements for a Hostel (Top of Ga Hostel aka TOG)Â for a bunk bed. My plan is to hike to Unicoi, spend the night, then slack pack tmw.Â 
Weather was beautiful and the trail was rocky but the inclines were manageable.Â 
The Gaps- usually low points for the trail, but high points for roads that go over these mtns. So we hike down to gaps, then hike up from them. God and Mother Nature can beÂ cruel. Most of these are very steep.Â 
TOG - owned and operated by Sir Packs A Lot. Very clean and well organized with free shuttles to two Gaps and to town (Hiawasse, GA)Â at specified times. Fortunately, because Trinda and I had dropped a supply box in town and that would have been an additional 12 miles if I walked to this box, or hitched. Shuttle took us into town for dinner and myÂ re supply. Got back took a shower and fell asleep fast.","Low Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap,"May 02, Tue",9.70
B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563013,"Hell yeah, that's right 16.7 miles +. The concept of slack packing is you carry on the bare essentials for a day hike (water, food, jacket, and a light source) TOG gave me a small backpack and I loaded up and was at Unicoi Gap at 8:39 with the plan to hike 16.7 miles to meet the shuttle at 4:00- that would be a pace around 2 mph. I can easily hike 3mph at home with a 30# pack, but that's home and this is definitely not Kansas. So straight out of Unicoi (2949' elevation)Â is Rocky Mt. (4017') this rise is over 1.4 miles. I made it to the top in 30 minutes- better than the plan. On the descent it was over some flat rocks that slope downward. I got a little too cocky, and tried to maintain the speed, placed my hiking pole in a good spot and landed my right foot in an awkward position, damn that hurt. But I pressed on, albeit at a much slower pace, and each step down was not pleasant at all. I was too afraid to stop take the shoe off because I didn't want to see the swelling or give it time to cool off. Down the trail I go. Up and over several PUDS (pointless ups and downs) at first water was plentiful, so I didn't stop to resupply. The map showed water continuously on down. Tray Mtn a time 4430 was difficult, but for some reason I found Kelly 4126' to be harder. I'm guessing the 826' gain in the span of a mile and the sun. By the time i was ready to resupply water, I noticed the streams were all between a half mile to a full mile round trip (not included in the daily mileage- as these are blue blazes, unlike the AT's white blazes. Blazes are about 6"" by 2"" painted stripes indicating which trail you are on. No choice but to bite the bullett and go down a blue blaze for water. At the top of Powell Â I was 3.2 miles from Dicks Creek Gap to meet the shuttle. Soul Keeper texted me and offered to pick up anything I needed from town- Thank you again for your kindness!
Got to the Gap at 5:30 and lo and behold the shuttle showed up at the same time saving me a half mile road walk to TOG. Soul Keeper to my rescue again! Pull up to the Hostel - it was like being welcomed home. My friends Bruno, Andre, Mike, Lone Woof, and Smiley were all there welcoming me back and wishing my ankle aÂ speedy recovery.","Unicoi Gap

Zero days are double edged sword, you need them to recuperate but they kill your average daily mileage.Â Bad storms are predicted today. So sad to depart from Soul Keeper as she is section hiking south from Dicks Creek to Unicoi where her friends will pick her up in two daysÂ and take her home.Â 
Sitting here with my foot elevated listening to Smiley on the guitar. Man this is the life!
The plan is to go to town and pick up an ankle brace and some decent food. Eating out of your pack is not as glamorous as it sounds!

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564267,"started cool brisk morning from Top Of Ga hostel around 9 am. Ankle still tender, but thankfully the trail was not too rocky. I find the roots to be a pain, but it's the rocks that can tweak your feet in odd angles. So most of the day I'm hiking with my eyes to the ground looking for those hazards. Made it to the Ga/NC border around 3:00, and looked to the east and saw the storm clouds moving in. Within 30 minutes it became a deluge, but we soldiered on, we had 3 miles to go to get to the shelter. And of course it was straight up. Got to a full shelter around 5:30,Â as a matter of fact - standing room only.Â 
Set up tarp, used the doors (great adder for the tarp- worth every penny) as the wind was blowing the 40 degree rain. One thing I hate ( of the many hiking fears I have) is being cold, but add wet and it becomes dangerous. Fixed dinner at the shelter, changed into dry clothes, and crawled in the hammock.

Closest thing to trail drama.Â 
Carter Gap met up with Gen Hendrix and Phantom- super fast hikers. Hendrix has become our fire starter. He has an interesting hiking mindset- he has a French press for his coffee, bongos for music, solar charger, Samsung tablet, GoPro, giant sharpie, fishing line with 3 oz lead weight, small hatchet, yoga mat, 8 lbs of food....let's just say we estimate his pack weighs 60 pounds. I'm in awe how fast he can hike.

We met David Waters (Gray Eagle) someone needs to write a book about this legend. He flew a P38 in WWII, works trail magic for hikers (shuttling people to Franklin, and all points needed) He took us from Rock Gap to Budget Inn for a nice dry bed and showers. His Jeep was full with all six of us stinky hikers, a Lab, and six big packs strapped to the top. After checking into the motel (51.00 per nite for three of us) he took us to Asian all you can eat buffet.

Yesterday on our slack pack. I used my front pouch as a fanny pack, I used straps off of my pack to hold the pouch on my hip. But noticed this morning one of the straps was gone. I looked all over and could not find it. So rigged up some extra cord to make it work. Then as usual the trail provides, we get out of the truck to start the hike today, lo and freaking behold the strap was sitting there on a rock. The universe provides!

Fire has devastated the Wayah Bald. Really sad. The tower where we camped was a stone tower that had a wooden roof - the fire must have been ferocious up here at 5342'.

At Top of GA Hostel way back when...Sir Packs A Lot warned us GA was a 4 on a scale of one to ten...I cussed his scale then. He said NC was a 6 and the Smokies are a 10. Straight up over 6 miles from 1700' elevation (the dam) to Doe Knob at 4520'...ouch - yep GA doesn't seem so bad now.
First real break on the climb is Shuckstack FireTower - long abandoned. The climb up that tower on shaky hand railings was worth the views, and we managed to be there during some kind of mating rituals going on with the butterflies. It appeared like they were oblivious to us and were in the middle of dog fights. I made some interesting videos in slo-mo with my camera, but BushMasterÂ and his 360 degree camera allowed you to see all around you. I'm going to have to look into that device.....after my hike.
Coming down the last ridge on the approach to the shelter - for some reason I was in the front of the pack today by about a half mile and I hear some tumbling to my right. A ferocious 15 foot tall bear and her three bloodthirsty cubs were maybe 30 feet from me...well I might have exaggerated. The cubs scrambled up two different trees and momma was anxiously running between both trees and looking up the trees and then at me. I believe I was more scared than she was. My video of this shows my shaky hands and my voice sounds like a nervous Don Knotts and his one bullet. I dropped my phone, I swore, I yelled, but that momma was not leaving those cubs, so I finally realized this and backed up the trail for my crew to catch up. In a genius move they decided the bears weren't leaving so they decided to run - leaving the old slow guy at the back of the pack...I see now I'm the sacrificial hiker I always joked about. We made it out of that little valley and to the shelter. all on adrenaline.Â We set up for dinner and somebody spilled about half their dinner outside.....The park service requires you to sleep in the shelter if there is space - I'd have slept on top of it if I had to.

Came to an outcrop called Buzzard Rock, nice place for a dramatic picture of your hero here. I thought I had accomplished something till I was met by the geriatric team from New York. I swear not one of the was younger than 70. One of the women was 77 years old and hiked every chance she got, what a pleasure to meet her and have my ego brought down a peg.Â 
The shelter we arrived at had a gray view of the distant mountains and of the ""corral"" for the Grayson Highland ponies. Thunder and menancing clouds were rolling in, so decided I'd sleep in Shelter. OMG, I've never seen so many mice in one place, it sounded like someone was walking on leaves all night. No stress was closest to the hoard. His pack was attacked all night. One mouse he was able to knock unconscious and sling toward Magic, who in turn was swinging wildly to get the stunned mouse away from him. If I wasn't so tired this whole episode would have been videotaped, it was hilarious.Â

Once arrived found a neat little country store similar to what my great uncle had near Lewisburg. It had a little bit of everything, from bear traps, to plumbing or electrical supplies to food, prepared or packaged. I opted for a balogna and cheese sandwich with chips, honeybun, peanut butter crackers, and topped it off with a Gatorade.Â 
Back to the trail and short ways in came to Dismal Falls. Beautiful site and would have been a great campsite. Onward came up on a good size pond with fish in it.

While there Rocket & Rockette were there! He had to stop for a few days to give his knees some rest. I'm sorry I didn't get to talk with them more, but it was getting late and we had to move.

We had three portages, one was supported by the outfitter, so it wasn't bad at all. The other two required emptying the vessels and carrying canoes and gear below the dams.

After day 1 I switched with bday for the kayak, better on my back and my stress. But quickly found I had drug bottom so many times I had developed a hole in the bottom and needed to stop every five miles to drain.Â 
Day two we stealth camped at someone's cabin. No sign of a recent stay by the owner and no signs warning us not to trespass. We left it same if not better than when we got there.Â

Hiked into Harpers Ferry, first hike with head lamp. That was fun and somewhat cooler - I'll need to do that more often. 20 miles and as the day progressed it got exponentially hotter. I should have drank more water, but sources were scarce. Harpers Ferry is a beautiful historical town, I could spend days here looking at sights. Stopped at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy office and had my picture taken and recorded as the 1608th thru hiker to make it that far Â 
We ended up in a B&B that had cots that were very comfortable, maybe too comfortable. No- Stress arranged with his father to drive the wolf pack to Maine so we could flip-flop south and avoid the oppressive heat. The heat index for HF was 107 - way too hot to hike safely, at least for this fella.Â 
Ride up was comfortable in his van and we stopped one night in Sturbridge, MA. We went down the street to eat at a BBQ joint, and came upon more trail magic.

It's 20 miles but the gravel road in requires 40 minutes. The park is trying to preserve the wilderness aspect so they apparently don't grade the gravel too often, so the ride was like driving over a washboard. Ole Man - the owner- is very knowledgeable, so I'm not regretting the extra expense. He advises us bears are not much concern due to the aggressive hunting/culling they do here, that we don't have to worry about poisonous snakes till we get down to Mass., and that porcupines and the small red squirrels are our biggest concerns. Also the trail looks like someone cooked spaghetti and threw it on a plate - of course he was referring to one of my arch enemies on the trail - roots. Oh and you may see some rocks and mud bogs!Â 
Anyway back to the trail- it's a 5 mile hike up to the summit and 5 miles back- so as far as trail miles goes, we only get to count 5 miles for today's total. And to allow 8-10 hours....wait what? After climbing up and taking 3-1/2 hrs - I now know why. The ascent has a lot of boulder scrambling and rebar drilled into rock to help with climbing. Words can't describe this - so I'll leave it to your imagination. Once arriving to the top I saw more bloody knees and arms - one woman had a bloody face- I hesitate to guess what happened , but she had a smile on her face. The summit is above tree line (5263') and has one of the best views of Maine one could ever hope for. This truly is in the wilderness. I suggest googling Baxter State Park to read more about it.Â 
Took our pictures and saw some thru hikers break down and cry after completing their journey. My hat is off to these people for completing a Herculean task. I pray I have it in me to complete mine as well. While mine will be a little anti-climatic finishing in Harpers Ferry, it will still be carrying my home on my back and walking over some of the harshest terrain and elevation gain and loss equal to climbing Mt Everest 18 times (515,000 feet of elevation gain over the whole trail)!
The descent took 4-1/2 hrs. Magic unbelievably met a friend from high school who wants to hike for about 30 days to test himself. John is from Boston area and works in construction. We will take him under our wings to see if we can help him.Â

So I'm a little overly cautious (some might say anal) but I don't have much body day to live off of, and no means for killing a moose.

Who knew you could get dinner and a show this far from civilization?
I'm not going to bore you with the details- but the 10 mile section I breezed through was very deceiving. The first 50 miles in were challenging, but nothing your hero couldn't handle. The last 50....well let's just say it was hard as hell. No bones about it, I thought about quitting many times, especially when passing NOBO (north bound thru hikers) saying southern Maine is probably the hardest part of the whole trail. What?!!!
I will try to put into words, but I'm sure I will fail, to detail the beauty of this section. If it gives you any indication of how I felt about this section, let's just say I would hike it again- even as hard as it was the scenery and the remoteness are nothing short of spectacular. Please see some of the pictures I'll post in this journal.Â 
I hate to tell you, but Birthday quit the trail half way in and walked to a road and got a ride into town, eventually making it home. Been with me for most of this journey, but injuries got the better of him and it was best for him. I hope he got what he needed from this journey and he can complete it someday. I hope we can remain friends and see each other somewhere else down the trail of life.Â Funny story - so one lean to (the shelters are now called lean to's here in Maine) we stayed near had a group of summer camp kids staying at it. Magic had set his hammock a little too close to them, and these boys tormented him by thumping his tarp and running away. At first he thought it was one boy because he kept seeing green shorts running away. Then he realized they all had green shorts. Finally he caught a glance of which kid it was. Next morning he saw the kid packing his backpack, then the kid walked away. Oh yeah, magic stuffed three rocks in the bottom of this bag . We are still laughing about what this kid figured out and when.
Got to Monson Maine- what a quaint little town. I've never been up here before but it's really quite homely. One young man walking with us to go get dinner, said - there's nothing to do here- which my reply was Exactly the way I would want it!","Mt. Kahtadin

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574804,"So sorry for Radio silence. Verizon is by far the best service on the trail, but even with that its spotty at best, and I've tried to stay in contact with family best I can and conserve time and battery life.Â 
Stayed in Monson for a day and a half at Shaw's hostel. Very hiker friendly. In the parking area here I noticed a car with TN tags, and even more amazing from Wilson Cty. Finally caught the owner who is helping her husband finish his section hike. They live in the town I grew up in. What a small world.Â 
Hiked out in beautiful weather over some varied terrain. Have I said how much I hate rocks and roots? Otherwise it's fun.Â 
Into Caratunk, had a mail drop/ resupply sent by Trinda. Winter gear is needed , temps dip here into 40's at night. Didn't quite think that one through when I flipped. Decided I had enough food and weather looked good, so I bumped it forward to Rangeley. PO here operates 2:00 to 4:00, yep two hours a day. And just south of town is a river that requires us to ride a canoe across. The ATC pays for a Greg to sit there from 9:00 am to 2:00pm ferrying hikers across this unpredictable river. So at first I thought maybe Greg was the ferryman and the postal worker, but it was not.Â 
On way toward Stratton crossed some interesting peaks. One day we were only able to squeeze in 8 miles of hiking, could have gone further, but a bad storm was predicted and I had no desire to be above tree line facing hail and high winds. This turned out to be a good decision. Next morning I took off at 6:00 and was treated to wet rocks that were slippery. I broke one of my trekking poles and slipped and slid down a 15 foot slab of granite landing on my elbows. Nasty little gash on one elbow and bruise on the other. No pain, no rain, no Maine. Looks like I have all three done.Â 
Rangeley is a tourist town, on the scale of Helen, Ga ... kind of. Zeroed here, the shoes while they were fine down south are not gonna cut it up here with sharp wet rocks. So I ordered three pair into Andover from REI. I'll pick out the best fitting pair and send the other two back.Â 
Hiked out and made Andover in two days. I was up and out early, I prefer to leave early in am (cooler) and arrive at camp for best site selection. Plan was three day to Andover, but I was 5 miles from Andover and got message the others were shortening the day because Magic was sick. They were 8 miles behind me. So I pushed over Old Blue Mtn at 5:00. Called Human Nature Hostel from Mtn top and hiked last 1 mile- took 1.5 hrs to descend this beast. It had rebar ladders to cover the tricky parts. Lots of fun!","Monson

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575704,"Wow, what a blast. The trail has been very eclectic this past 10 days.Â 
Andover was a reprieve from the regular and the Human Nature Hostel was the start. This is owned by Ryan Holt (Yukon) from Naked and Afraid reality show (and no he wasn't naked) but he has started building a geodesic dome with the intent of running the best hostel on the trail. Friar Tuck was there, and he hiked half the trail last year and lost 100 lbs. This year he started southbound from Katahdin. On his first day he got up there, but could not get down before dark. He ended up staying up there all night. When he finally made it down, he met the rangers arranging a search party for him. He is really lucky the weather wasn't too bad.Â 
Out of Andover I hiked over to the next town. Bethel, Maine and stayed at Chapman Inn. Very quaint town and all the beauty of New England character. Hitched by myself for first time in about 40 years. Not so hard as a thru hiker in a hiker friendly town.Â 
Back to the Wolf Pack at Grafton Notch and Old Speck Mtn. Once you reach the top it's literally all downhill from here to Mahoosuc Notch. Labeled as either the hardest or fun one mile of the trail. This notch is a rock scramble playground. The challenge was to find your way over around or under giant house sized boulders. It was fun and I think I usually find myself making hard challenges harder than they really are. It's a mental game.Â 
Up and over Mt Hayes toward Gorham, NH. On the descent (not a very steep one, but had sloping exposed granite that was wet from rain. I did my best to not injure myself, but slipped backwards again, landed on my butt and used my hands to buffer the fall. Tweaked my wrist (it's still stiff today but no swelling)
B-cubed flew in and has spent the past weekend with me and we have been driving around this beautiful area. We drove up to Mt Washington (technically I'm supposed to hike it, but I'm not a ""Purist"" when it comes to the trail. Yeah, I know, it's hard to believe, I've been working on not being a perfectionist HYOH.Â 
There is a road that was built in 1861 to reach the summit of Mt Washington 6288' elevation. At this peak the highest recorded winds on the planet were recorded here - 231 mph. The weather is rarely good here and it didn't fail. We had 60mph winds and rain, half way down it was sunny and calm. When we reached the top Magic and No Stress were there, so we had some fun with the weather. But it would be a seriously dangerous mountain to climb. Glad I drove up.Â 
On to Woodstock tonight and Franconian Ridge tmw to try and see as much of the eclipse as possible. But I'll miss my B-cubed she flies home and I'll be back to the trail full time again. Nice vacation for me!","Andover

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575798,"B-cubed took us to the trailhead and headed off to Manchester,NH to catch her flight home. Always hard to say bye to the one you love.Â Took the trail up to Franconian Ridge and summited Mt Lafayette, Mt Lincoln, and Haystack Mtn. Last part of the Presidential Mtn range in the Whites of NH. Watched the partial eclipse from the ridge line. Great views and good weather.Â 
Hiked back down to see if No Stress's shoes came in. No luck. Waiting to see what happens.","Woodstock, NH

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576195,"The Notch hostel in Woodstock is managed by a real genuine person named Bookie. She does a heat job dealing with all types of hikers. Took off to tackle the last 4K ft mountain we have to climb. And it was an intense climb, trail club has done a great job putting in ladders and steps chiseled into the slabs of granite, making it somewhat safer to climb or descend. Once we were at top, it was over reeling with strong winds, but we had partly cloudy conditions. So we had some sporadic great views. As we started the decent the trail became a trail. It was almost like those scenes in a movie where angels sing and a beam of light shines on you. I turned to look at No Stress behind me and he too was marveling - a flat trail with few rocks or roots and mostly dirt and pine needles. It was like walking on carpet. First time in over 400 miles since I've seen that.Â 
Next day we were given Trail Magic by the Omlet Guy. He has a tarp set up on the sid of the trail and he makes inlets for hikers. You can order as big as you want. I got four egg, didn't want to seem greedy, but I could've eaten more. He said the largest he made was a 30 egg omlet. That's not a typo- he said a German ordered and ate every bit of it right there. I tried to give him a donation but he refused. He said if he took money the Park Rangers would kick him out, and even if he could he wouldn't take money. He does it for the hikers.Â 
Up and over Cube Mountain (yep it's Trinda's Mtn) then over Smart Mtn which I tried to speed up my pace. And stupidly twisted my ankle and bent my third hiking pole in about a 90 degree. Surprisingly I got used and hiked on, I really thought I had hurt it - same ankle I twist d in GA. Magic was able to bend the pole back straight, but it won't collapse so I can put in my pack.Â 
Made it into Hanover and stayed in Lebanon, NH. Washed clothes and resupplied - heading over the Connecticut River tomorrow- this takes me into Vermont!","Woodstock, NH
","Hanover, NH","Aug 26, Sat",52.70
B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576553,"I cannot express my gratitude for the hard work trail maintenance clubs do. Especially in Vermont- maybe it's the easier terrain or it's just the beautiful weather (btw - it's been high 60's to low 40's and sunny - perfect hiking weather) but this has been a great section to walk in the woods (ref Bill Bryson's book)
Coming out of Hanover is a bridge over the Connecticut River right into Norwich Vermont. Looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Homes date from the late 1700's to early 1800's and are immaculately maintained. First little mom and pop grocer gives hikers day old sandwiches for free (all gone by the time I get there, but they gave me doughnuts- much appreciated. Then the hike goes right up Elm street, high end subdivision (5 to 7 car garages) - three homes had coolers with soft drinks or snacks at end of their driveways with signs ""for hikers"". I can't figure out if it's a bribe to keep us from camping in their yards, or if they are just that considerate. One of the owner comes out to talk with us - they are just that kind.Â 
After two nights made it to the outskirts of Gifford Woods state park. Found out they charge $5 to camp there from a young thru hiker named Aden from Birmingham England. So I set up in the woods shy of the park around 6pm - this is my first big day since VA. Almost 20 miles. My legs are feeling strong , well the mountains are smaller and the stars are lining up.Â 
Got up next morning and hiked 4 miles to the highway and hitched into Rutland. Got a ride in about 10 minutes. Staying at the Yellow Deli hostel - kind of a cult feel, but it's clean has showers and can wash the stinky clothes. All they ask is to either help out around with housekeeping or a donation. I'm helping out.","Hanover, NH

B-Squared,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580065,"Hey...I have been avoiding the update and I apologize. I walked into Harpers Ferry on 10/6, thereby completing my AT thru hike as a Flip Flopper.
The journal was a great way for me to include you, and I apologize for not maintaining entries. I will give you some highlights.
Maine/New Hampshire and Vermont were the most beautiful states. With the first two mentioned as the hardest..its the 80/20 rule. They cover twenty percent of the mileage, but represent eighty percent of the effort. Bushmaster said it best, I'm paraphrasing.... ""Maine, come hike our trails. When you are done we should give you free knee replacements"".
Mass, Conn, & NY.....pretty and I think I gained all the weight I lost back in these states...too many road crossings with deli's. We couldn't resist.
NJ and PA....did I ever tell you I hate rocks? I'm so glad I won't be going back there. I really did enjoy Sunfish Pond, and....well leaving PA.
MD...did I really just hike that? Such a small section of the trail.
My opinion of the trail .....it sucked. Would I do it again....hell no. BUT...the journey was well worth it, the effort was one of the hardest things I've done in my life and I don't have any regrets...well I would like to have the Tiffany doll back that got left behind in the 100 mile wilderness. I met some interesting people, experienced a once in a lifetime journey that most people only dream about, saw some majestic views and learned a lot about myself.Â 
Would I do another long distance hike...most assuredly. As I speak Cubed and myself are making plans to hike one of the Camino pilgrimages next year in Spain, and maybe one of the treks in Great Britain as well.
To the friends I met on the trail ( I really consider everybody I met....yes even including ZZ Top at Standing Bear, the New Jersey punk I met at campground in VA...my friends) Thanks for the memories! A special thank you goes to Magic Mike, No Stress, BushMaster, and Birthday for letting me tag along and share our experiences. I hope we can hike together again some day! And the biggest THANK YOU goes to my wife who first supported my dream, and secondly for all the time she took to help my journey.
In case you are interested follow Cubed and myself on Instagram while we travel ...tntitanup. Birthday Iâm catching up! I have 50 followers now!","
