Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456367,"May, 2014 is suddenly here. If that sounds overly obvious, planning a hike on the Applalachian Trail (AT) was always months away, but suddenly I'm leaving in three days. Even though I'm retired from gainful employment, life's been busy. That's OK, it makes the time goes quickly. Last summer, I thru hiked the Long Trail in Vermont which included a 105 mile piece of the AT. The LT was quite an accomplishment. Only 273 mile long, it's terrain is very difficult to hike. Even though I am 68 years young, I still have a couple of years of hiking left in me, and the AT was always a lifelong dream. Back in the 1950's our scoutmaster mesmerized us boys as he described this new trail that runs along the east coast. That description opened up a dream world that ready started two years earlier. I spent the first nine years of my life growing up in the city - Detroit.   My dad, an insurance company manager, was transferred to Mansfield Ohio. We bought a house situated next to deep woods where I spent hours exploring this new world, where the dream took roots. As life goes, education, work, family and financial responsibilities through the years prevented me from pursuing that dream. All that is in the past. I've fulfilled those obligations, and now I have the freedom to finally look to the dream!   The big one. The Appalachian Trail.",,View Entry,"May 17, Sat",0
Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456555,"This season I will hike one quarter of the trail from the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, to Damascus Virginia. That a distance of 468 miles. I said previously that I have the freedom to hike, and indeed I do. However my wife Yvonne has some potentially serious health issues, so I choose not to be gone for any extended time period. So I'll break the hike in large chunks. I plan on taking 40 days for this first section.   Maybe I'll do a larger piece next year. This hiking business is more than a hobby, or a ""good time"". I like to use the time to reflect on my relationships with Yvonne, my grown children, my neighbors, and all the people I associate with at church as well as total strangers in the grocery store. I use this time to be introspective, to really look at myself; to see where I fall short. Do I treat the people at church differently than, say, the cashier at Walmart.   This is key to understanding my relationship with God as well. This alone time reveals much about oneself.   You could think of the trip as an extended examination of conscious, as we say in the Catholic tradition.   I really think the reason many people leave the trail is they cannot face themselves. All that said, the excitement is building. At this point, everything is ready. All bills are paid, the trash is taken out, and I've arranged for my neighbor to mow my lawn. Last week, I UPS'd my pack to the hostel I'll be staying at near the start of the trail. I'll be flying from Cleveland to Chicago to Atlanta, and I don't trust the baggage handlers to transfer my pack to the other plane in Chicago. The last thing I need is a lost pack. Besides I don't want TSA rummaging through my pack. I'll be staying at The Hiker Hostel, near the start of the trail. . The couple that run the place cater to hikers very well and has great service. They will pick me up at the Atlanta airport (actually at the north end of the MARTA train line), take me to their hostel and a bunk, feed me breakfast the next morning, the. Shuttle me to the trailhead. Let's see now, where's my Southwest plane ticket?",,View Entry,"May 18, Sun",0
Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456724,"The Hiker Hostel, near the trailhead called me today confirming my reservation with tomorrow. It's really happening!Southwest Airlines does not assign seats like most other airlines. It's first come first serve. They do however, split the waiting line at the gate into three sections, A, B, and C. A gets to board first, then B, then C last. A of course gets the choice seats. The group you are placed in depends on how soon you check-in. Passengers can check in 24 hours before the scheduled departure time. My plane leaves at 7:20am on Tuesday, so I made a point to check-in at 7:20am on Monday.   I watched the time very carefully and ready to hit Southwest's check-in button on the computer screen, and PRESS. I'm in group B!   All of my fellow passengers must have been doing the same thin, like we were all playing jeopardy ready to hit the button!Yvonne and I will be up at 2:00 tomorrow morning. Better take a sleeping pill this evening.",,View Entry,"May 19, Mon",0
Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456932,"The day started early for Yvonne and me; up at 2:00am. Headed out for Cleveland (OH) at 3:00. No on the road but us and the trucks. After we got checked through security, we found the Beach Comber restaurant on the concourse and had a breakfast of eggs over easy, bacon, hash browns, and toast. The food was exceptionally good, and the price reflected that. $31 for breakfast. 
The eatery was right across from Yvonne's gate, so we said our farewells, kissed goodbye, and I walked to my gate. Travel was uneventful but always tiring. 
Rode the MARTA train through Atlanta to the end of the line at North Spring Station where Leigh, owner of the Hiker Hostel, picked me up. We stopped at Subway and I took a sandwich to the hostel. 
This hostel is a paradise for day hikers. Five couples and two ladies hike the day and are picked up and brought back to a comfortable bed, shower, relaxing on the deck. It is unique in that it doubles as a hostel and a bed & breakfast.
Even though I came alone on this trip, making friends is easy. Hiking seems to bring out the best in people.",,Travel Day!,"May 20, Tue",0
Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/457536,"Breakfast at the Hiker Hostel was family style with all guests around the table. Owners Josh and Leigh served oatmeal, grits, French toast, scrambled eggs, and fruit.   Afterward, we all got shuttled to various trailheads as most were day hiking. I'm the only one going to Amicalola to hike the approach trail. Shannon drove me to the visitors center where I signed in as hiker no. 1347, then had my picture taken at the archway. Amicalola Falls is amazingly beautiful. 625 stair steps lead up the side of the falls. I hear a lot of debate about people deciding to start their hike either at the parking lot of FS road 42 one mile north of Springer, or from Amicalola State Park. They argue that the approach trail is not part of the AT, but the falls alone is worth the 9 mile hike from the visitors center to Springer Mountain. I was surprised at how easy the approach trail is, compared to the very difficult Long Trail hike I did last summer. I left the visitors center at 9:30, and got to The Springer summit at 2:00pm. At about mile 5, right in the middle of the trail, was an Eastern Diamondback rattlesnake coiled up and rattling. His head was pointed directly at me.   He would not move no matter how much coaxing. Better left alone, I bushwhacked around him. Monica is at the Springer shelter. I saw her entry at the summit register, and she is starting a thru hike today. Squeeze and his mate also arrived, and we had diner together. I thought I recognized his name from whiteblaze.net. I decide to pitch my new Lightheart Gear Solong 6 cuben tent. According to the register, previous hikers have had mice problems, so I think I'll avoid that tonight.   And as I lay here in my tent, I can hear the Georgia National Guard firing machine guns. That ought to scare the bears away.","Archway at Amicalola

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/457540,"Left Springer at 8:00 this morning intending to stop at Hawk Mountain shelter 8.7 miles north. It was only 11:30 when I got to the shelter trail and it just seemed too early to stop. Gooch Gap is another 7.7 miles, so what to do. I felt good so I decided to go for it. Besides, I can save a day which I may need later on. At Gooch Gap there is a father & son, Bill and John, making supper.   We converse about many subjects. Don is also here.   He is 48, and out of a job for six months. An electrical designer by trade, he came on the trail to try to relax from the stress of joblessness.   He ask me about my gear, and wishes his could be lighter, as he is struggling hiking every day. Tomorrow's a long day so I'll stay in the shelter tonight for a quicker start tomorrow.","Springer Shelter

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/457546,"Left Gooch shelter at 6:00am while everyone else was still sleeping. Met Flat Foot on the trail. He's 71 years old, looks 50. His pack is covered with patches of trails he's done, including the AT, the Continental Divide trail, the Pacific Coast Trail, and a few others. He still has a 50 miles stretch of the CDT before he calls it completed. He let me rub his AT patch for good luck. Most of the way up Blood Mountain I met two ladies, overweight and sweating profusely. They had nothing with them, not even water. They asked me how far it was to the top of the mountain, but they were walking the wrong way. They came up a side trail from a parking lot but couldn't see the trail going up hill. I realized later the trail was hidden by a switchback. I showed them on a map that they had to go the other way. I hope they were convinced. 
Of all the hiking I've done on the Long Trail and AT, I've never seen a maintainer paint blazes, until today. Pete and Sally Parsonson, a retired couple, maintain the trail on Blood Mountain. I came upon Pete meticulously freshening blazes on rocks near the top. He had a cutout pattern and a white paint marker. I asked him what kind of paint is used on trees. Oil based gloss enamel. 
Got to Mountain Crossings at 3:00 and got a bunk for the night. I found out that Winton Porter, author of Just Passin Thru, sold the place a couple years ago.","Gooch Gap Shelter

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/458700,"It's always nice staying in a hostel every few days. A shower and laundry is just like starting the first day.   Even though I slept in a bunk last night, I just didn't have the energy today. Even though the terrain was easy, I'll stop at Low Gap shelter, 11.5 miles. Met an older gentleman with the name Statesman, and hiking with his brother-in-law. Statesman hikes very slow and looks to have a bit of Parkinson's. He has been hiking the AT for 14 years, completing one state each year. Georgia is his last state and he will complete the AT this year.I arrived at Low Gap about 1:30 and there was a Boy Scout troop here that had stopped to rest and re-water.   They're on a shakedown hike getting ready to go to the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. I lay in the shelter while several hikers stop to get water. Tomorrow is a big day to Tray Mountain, so I'll rest.","Neels Gap - Mountain Crossings
",Low Gap Shelter,"May 24, Sat",11.50
Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/458712,"Left Low Gap shelter at first light, 6:00. All the families and single hikers that stopped here to water up yesterday, were camped along side the trail. There are many nice campsites trail side between Hogpen Gap and Unicoi Gap.   I saw several father-son hikers, and whole families being out here really impressed me. They appeared to be really enjoying themselves. I stopped for a rest and Pro-Bar snack at Unicoi Gap and met Ompah, Farm Girl, and Ken.   They are middle aged and well educated, I believe.   They said they were also going to Tray Mountain shelter.   When I arrived at 2:30, I got water, and as I ducked in the shelter, a thunderstorm erupted with pounding rain.   Matt is in the shred, also just arrived. He is wearing odd looking shoes. The heel is on a post and a coil spring, that supposedly makes a more comfortable walk. Then he tells me that yesterday, he saw a dead body on the trail. There appeared to be a snakebite on the man's heel, and the snake was still there. Something about his story doesn't ring true. He said he called the police but left before they got there; and people don't fall over dead immediately after a snake bite. Someone else told me this story earlier and they also said it sounded fishy. A troop of Boy Scouts, who were here getting water, also jumped in the shelter to avoid the rain. Two men walked in intending to stay, then Ompah and Farm Girl walked in 20 minutes later, soaked. This shelter is designed to hold only seven people. When the rain finally stopped, everyone was thankful the troop left so we could set up our bedding. The weather suddenly turned cool and rainy after several hot days.Everyone here is intrigued at my pack weight. No one has ever heard of cuben fiber so I show them my pack, liner, tent, and elicit a lot of wows. Ken, who was with Ompah and Farm Girl, shows up. Ompah explains that Ken has not been feeling well, and he was just going to take his time.   Farm Girl decides to set up her tent rather than be packed in a shelter with a bunch of men. Everyone turns in early and settled by 7:30.","Low Gap Shelter

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/458715,"It's Memorial Day, and all the others in the shelter are ending their hiking today. The next highway crossing is six miles ahead and everyone will get a ride or to their cars.   I'm feeling very fortunate to be able to continue. Normally when the trail comes to a gap, which is usually a road crossing, the trail descends an ascends very steeply, as does Dick's Creek Gap. There is a parking area with many parked cars, and there are picnic tables in the shade. I stop to lie down on the seat of one table. I then struggle to climb up the hill. The campsite where I'm staying tonite is only one mile further. The campsite is on top of a mountain at 3150 feet. I am the only one here. Beautiful tall oak trees shade the grounds. It is so peaceful here. My trail guide says there's water 100 yards down a steep trail. They aren't kidding. I filter four liters of water to cover dinner and breakfast   I do not want to go down that trail again.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/458716,"When I planned this hike I decided to follow David (AWOL) Miller's 15 miles per day plan as listed on his website. He has 12, 15, and 18 MPD plans to choose from. So far, the mile per day selections are making a lot of sense.   Today was only 10.5 miles and I'm glad there weren't more. It was a steep uphill climb all day, and really tested my leg muscles.   I saw two bears today while climbing Buzzard Knob.   They looked small and since they were running together, I think they were still cubs.   I did manage to get a photo and a video. I finally reached the Georgia/North Carolina border, and it gave me a real sense of accomplishment. Muskrat Creek is a fairly high shelter at 4580 ft. It is at the top of the ridge so cool winds blow through constantly. The roof covers a large vestibule area with a gravel floor. In the center there is a food preparation table made of 4""x8"" timbers. There are benches around the outside for seating.   At least 10 food bag strings hang from the rafters. The strings hang from nails and are threaded through the center of a can lid or a cat food can. The idea is if a mouse does get to the string, the lid/can presents a barrier to frustrate the mouse. We'll see if that works. My dinner is chili-mac, which I made a month ago, then dehydrated to a crispy dry mixture. I simply boil two cups of water and pour into the ziploc bag it was packaged. It's as good as the day it was made. There's no one else here, and the evening is quiet, except for the rumbling of thunder in the distance.","Campsite After Dick's Creek Gap Mile 70.6

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/458718,"On the trail at 7:00 this morning and did the jaunt over Standing Indian Mountain at 5500. The hike down on the north side was amazing.   The trail is right on top of the ridge, so there is clear view down the mountain into the valley below on both sides of the trail!   As I walk along I occasionally see different varieties of centipedes on the trail. Some are black with yellow legs, others have red legs.   So I ask God, ""Lord, what is the purpose of the yellow and red legged centipedes?""   Then there are those huge fat millipedes. Somehow, I think all those varieties of life keep the forest in balance. I planned to stop at Carter Gap shelter today for a 12.5 mile day, but I got there at 11:30. To early to stop. Besides, a note at that shelter warned of mice. The next shelter is 8.6 miles, and goes over steep Albert Mountain. I felt good today so I decided to go at least 3.5 more miles to Betty Trail Gap where there is a campsite. I arrived there at 2:00pm, and thought I've already come halfway to Long Branch shelter, I decided to go for it. 21.1 miles today. That's a new record for me. The climb up Albert was insanely steep but what a fantastic view at the top on the fire tower!   Once over Albert and heading the last 2.5 miles to Long Branch, I suddenly started singing and making up songs. What a sense of freedom!   Long Branch shelter was built in 2012 and the wood still smells new. Great place.","Muskrat Creek Shelter Mile 81.4

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/458863,"Looking forward to a short day today. Once I get to Winding Stair Gap, I'm going to thumb a ride into Franklin North Carolina, and Ron Haven's Budget Inn and Hostel. When I arrived at the gap, I collapsed and stowed my poles on the side of my pack, and pulled out the handmade sign I prepared.   On a 24"" x 30"" piece of Tyvek (new construction house wrap) I wrote HIKER TO TOWN. Very few cars were going by, and I stood by the road about 20 minutes before a new Ford pickup pulled into the parking area. Pete is about my age, and after telling him about myself, he thought it wonderful that someone my age would be hiking the trail. Then he asked if I was a veteran. I said, ""No, I was drafted in 1965 but I didn't pass the physical due to a medical issue.""   Pete suffers from leukemia because he was exposed to agent orange in Vietnam. He is however, a successful home builder.The lady at the counter of the Budget Inn has such a strong North Carolina drawl I have trouble understanding her. I pick up my resupply box and head to unit 18. The room is very simple and after doing laundry, I go to check out the hostel across the street. I will room there tomorrow. I walk up the very steep street to the Outdoor 76 store, that caters to hikers with a wide variety of gear and hiking footwear. Rob is helping Sandra with a new pair of shoes, and immediately spots me as a hiker. Must have been my clothes. We converse about restaurants, then Sandra offers to take me to the supermarket if I want.   I take her up on the offer. I buy bread, oil, and dried tomatoes as she completes her shopping. I then asked where I can get the best hamburger in town, and she drops me off at the Motor Company Grill. I'm thankful to her because it is raining as we drive. Rob had offered to re-tape my cozy, which is falling apart, which I will take care of tomorrow. .

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/458955,"I walk down the steep street to the ""Kountry Kitchen"", a small but exceptionally clean and well maintained restaurant, where a half dozen locals drink coffee, talk and joke with Cory the waitress.   Country music plays in the background. I order the eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast breakfast. I'm still hungry. So a bowl of oatmeal is my second round. Since I started at Springer Mountain ten days ago, I've been hopscotching shelters with Carey. He's a couple years younger than me but is thru hiking all the way to Maine.   A former newspaper reporter, he's stops frequently to interview people on the trail. His aim is to write a book about his experiences. I saw him again today in Franklin. It's funny how you keep seeing trail people as the hike progresses. Ron Havens, the owner of the Budget Inn came in this afternoon. This is one of several businesses he owns in the area. He is also a county commissioner for Macon County.   Ron bends over backwards for hikers coming to town. In the spring he shuttles hikers the 11 miles to and from the trail twice a day for free.   Then he runs a route around town taking hikers to the grocery, the outfitter, Walmart, etc.Ate dinner at Mulligan's and I had Smoky Mountain Chicken. Two breast layered with bacon and cheese. Probably not a good thing to eat normally, but when your hiking, it doesn't touch to sides going down.

Carey will also ride along to the trail. After breakfast at the Kountry Kitchen again, Kathy arrived at 7:30 as planned. She moved to Franklin from South Carolina 3 years ago, and drives a 1986 Jeep Cherokee with 400 thousand miles on it. I was wondering if we were going to make it from town to the trail head without breaking down. The morning in town was pea soup thick fog. As the highway climbed to Winding Stair Gap, the sun broke out to a beautiful morning.   Ready to hike, Carey wanted to write in his tablet for a while so I hiked on ahead.   The Bertram Trail runs concurrent with the AT for a few miles, and there were a couple signs set up for the Make A Wish Foundation for terminally ill children. I then met a couple who were hiking for the foundation to raise funds. I congratulated them for their efforts just as the Bertram Trail split off the AT. I, of course, went their direction for a half mile before I realized the trail did not seem right.   I verified my mistake with my phone GPS.   That's an extra mile walking today. My plan was to hike 11 miles to Wayah Bald Shelter, at which I arrived at 1:00. Too early to stop so I decided to push for Cold Spring shelter.   Uphill all the way.    As I arrived, a steady hard rain began.   I would like to set up my tent, but the rain keeps me in the shelter. Carey arrived soaked as did Tom, an IT salesman who just out for a few days. Tom told us the story of a bear incident at Low Gap shelter, where we stayed a few days ago. Apparently one of the hikers in the shelter left his food bag on the table in front of the shelter. In the middle of the night, a bear came right in the shelter, and sat on the table and helped himself to the food bag. Everyone in the shelter was yelling and throwing things at the bear, who took the bag and left. That made me a firm believer in hanging our food on a bear bag line.","Winding Stair Gap-Franklin Budget Inn

As I was lying in my sleeping bag, I could feel them running over my legs. They came out of the corners where there is a space between the wall and floor hear them scurrying and I jerk quickly and shine my head lamp in the corner and I can see their faces peering at me. It became a game. I would quickly jump and turn on my light, and they would scurry in their holes. They're super fast.  It seemed like they settled down after a while, but I didn't get much sleep. That's not good because I am planning an 18.4 mile day today.The good part, it's 12 miles, mostly downhill to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). What a complex. The NOC is a combination restaurant, hiker hostel, whitewater canoe training facility for national competitions including the Olympics. Arriving at noon, I park myself in the restaurant and order and snarf down a hiker cheeseburger and fries at the outdoor table.   With seven more miles to hike, better get going.

The Fontana Lodge gives hikers a break with their rates, $59 for the night. My room is very upscale with plush pillows and such. The laundromat is a separate building. I want to wash everything, including what I'm wearing. I take my rain gear with me to change into while everything washes. The laundromat is cracker box sized, and there's no restroom where I can change. Their is a lady and a young child present, so I guess I won't wash what I'm wearing.

I did see four wild turkey's today, at different times, all of then were walking on the trail. I was able to get as close as 20 feet before they walked off. Standing about four feet high, they are a magnificent looking bird. As I hike the fog is very thick and it starts to rain in earnest. The wind is picking up giving me a chill. It is only 63 degrees. I arrive at Double Springs and am greeted by a couple my age who started thru hiking on April 28. He is retired from the Navy, and he and his wife are enjoying the hike.

That's ok, I've been here many times before. Later at Newfound Gap, what a change from trail life. Hundreds of tourists park and enjoy the now bright sunshine.   Many ask about my hike. Where I started, when will I finish, how much does your pack weigh. My real intent was to yogi a cold drink from a tourist. Sure enough, one gentleman brought me an ice cold Dr. Pepper and a water. No more than a tenth of a mile from Newfound Gap, a bear was ambling along the trail feeding on the vegetation on the side of the trail.   He didn't seem to care I was behind him. I clicked my poles and shouted, but he just looked back at me, then continue walking slowly on the trail.   This went on for 20 minutes when two young ladies approached from the opposite direction. I could hear them coming as they were talking loudly. I tried waving to them but they suddenly caught sight and abruptly stopped.   The bear slowly ambled off the trail until we could pass. Once again, the shelter is full, 12 people.   Avatar and Tic Tac came in, two older gentlemen in their 70's who are very experienced hikers, a single guy roaming the park, a man from Belgium who is in the US for a business conference with some extra days for hiking, and then a family of five from Michigan, including a 2 year old boy.The skies finally cleared, and what a gorgeous view from Icewater Springs shelter.","Double Springs Shelter

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460819,"Day 18. I caught up to four middle aged gentlemen taking a pack-off break on a steep uphill section. One was hoisting his huge pack, and it was so heavy, he had to bend over forward to pull the pack in place. I was afraid he was going to have a heart attack. I think gear sales people oversell to the first time backpacker. There are so many gadgets that dazzle the eyes, it's really hard to say no. So far, the Smokys shelters have been full every night. Cosby Knob shelter has a group of three dads and four boys, a single gentleman in his 70's who has decided to take up hiking, a couple I passed on the trail earlier, and two Ridgerunners, Carl ""Gray Beard"" and David ""Star Child"".   I was asked to show my thru hikers permit, so I guess they really do ask. They are here to oversee the installation of a new privy that will be dropped in tomorrow. Ridgerunner Carl said if anyone else shows up, I'll have to tent, since the daily reservation holders have precedence over thru hiker permit holders.Luckily, no one else came.","Icewater Springs Shelter

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460820,"Day 19. Quite frankly, I am glad to be leaving the Smokys. I feel I am overly regulated. Sleeping in a crowded shelter is a requirement, and it's illegal to camp on my own off the trail.It's ten miles to the I-40 overpass, and two more to the Standing Bear Farm Hostel. On arrival, host Curtis hands out an envelope on which you write your trail name, then you keep your own tally of the items taken from the food pantry. He only looks at the bottom total. They trust the hikers who stay.   There is a bunk house with 14 bunks, a separate kitchen building with stove, refrigerator, table; everything for making your own dinner. They so have a pantry with some frozen foods.   When I arrive, I eat two jumbo cheeseburgers. I need to wash everything so input on my rain gear. The laundry is a double sink with a washboard and a wringer. I can't remember when I've done laundry by hand. Afterward, I get a frozen pepperoni pizza from the pantry for dinner, and cook it in the special pizza oven in the kitchen. Maria have a great place with friendly atmosphere.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460821,"Day 20. Standing Bear Farm Hostel is a great place to zero, but the climb going north is hellacious. The first two hours is straight up.   The day is up and down, then the climb up Snowbird Mountain made it worth the climb. That's one of the best views so far. I saw bear number four today. At the top of Rube Ridge, I startled a medium sized bear and he climbed a tree right in front of me. He looked around the tree to see what I was going to do, so I backed up slowly. He jumped down and scurried away. Bears can move very fast. Max Patch Bald is equally impressive. There's a parking lot close enough for day hikers to walk to the top with lawn chairs. Several groups of people were either enjoying the view, flying kites, or having lunch. As I was standing at the top one couple about fifty yards away waved at me as they were seated near the trail. I walked over to then and they asked about my hike. They introduced themselves as Ken and Nikki, along with their four year old grandson Skylar. Ken then asked if I would like some cold fresh cut fruit. Wow this is real trail magic. I dug in my pack for a container and spoon and indulged. I topped it off with a glass of Welsh tea. The skies appeared to darken a bit so we said our farewells, and my thanks. The rains came in buckets before I got to Walnut Mountain shelter. When I arrived, ""Granny"" was there with her granddaughter Abby, a sixth grader. They are out for a couple days and they've set up their tent. The shelter is very small and old and I'm afraid the mice would keep me company so I set up my tent. Some of the floorboards in the shelter are missing. Avatar and Tic Tac also hiked the 20 miles today. There is a nice new picnic table here, so all of us sit and have fun conversation while we fix dinner.   The other hikers start a campfire but I'm too tired and retreat to my tent for the night.","Standing Bear Farm Hostel

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460822,"It poured rain last night but the morning brings bright sunshine. I started the hike today seeing my fifth bear. A cub darts off a tree and scampers into the woods. Halfway down Bluff Mountain is a tent setup along the trail.   I meet Kinder, an amiable white haired elderly lady, who is very interested in my hike. She asked if I met Granny at Walnut Mountain. The people from my home town of Port Clinton Ohio think it unbelievable that I would go hiking the AT, yet older people who live in the Appalachian region think nothing of climbing mountains. I suppose it's ingrained from youth. Walnut Mountain shelter is at 4600' elevation, and my destination of Hot Springs is 1300'. That's a drop of 3300', and is incredibly hard on the feet and knees.   Long downhills are as difficult as uphill climbs. Hot Springs is indeed a hiker friendly town. The trail goes through the Main Street of town, where the town has embedded bronze AT trail markers in the sidewalk every hundred feet. Elmer's Sunnybank Inn is unique for a hiker hostel.   It is a very large four square style home with seven or eight bedrooms, listed in the National Register of Historic Homes. Elmer greets all hikers and is very welcoming.   The door to my room has a plaque that says Earl Schaffer slept here on two different thru hikes in 1948 and 1998. After going to the laundromat I go next door to the Still Mountain Restaurant, and order the pulled pork dinner with baked beans and fries. My legs are spent, and I hit the bed early.

Seven hikers sit around the table family style and enjoy great conversation. Elmer and I share the same last name, as does Josh, who hiked in with me. Elmer is a former college professor at Dartmouth. Avatar and Tic Tac are ending their hike today. They will be back next year to pick up here in Hot Springs for another month of hiking. Young 10 year old Tic Tac was walking 20 mile days through the mountains with his dad. I'm sitting on the back porch typing this journal, when Cary shows up walking in this morning. I haven't seen him since Fontana Lodge. Cary continues to write his AT book, and goes to the public library to use the computer. The library closes at 1:00pm today, so he goes to the local outfitter and uses the computer available there. I nap through the afternoon, recovering from the last few days.   Later, Josh, Wolvereng, Cary and myself go to the Smoky Mountain Diner across the street for dinner. We all come back and watch AT videos with Elmer. The Sunnybank Inn is part of a couple of the videos.","Elmer's Sunnybank Inn - Hot Springs

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461693,"Day 23. It's easy to get soft when sleeping in a great bed at Elmer's. I forewent Elmer's great breakfast only because he doesn't serve until 8:30am. I rose at 5:30 and walked across the road to the Smoky Mountain Diner for bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. So back to Elmer's and I'm ready to hike by 7:00. Hot Springs is quiet in the early hours, and I sit on the bench in front of the outfitter store to use their wi-fi. I later head out of town across the French Broad River bridge, then turn into the mountains where the trail turns steeply up. Today I am hiking alone, and as quite often happens, the monotony of step after step causes the mind to think about the past events of my life.   I walk along faced with a myriad of thoughts. Some happy, leaves me laughing out loud, some sad leaving me in tears. Out of nowhere, I suddenly missed my mother, who died six years ago. Only out here is there time for that to surface. Then I felt tremendous repentance for my lack of parenting skills and all the little ways my three children were injured. Then I feel overwhelming love for them. Then a rush of loneliness for Yvonne my wife.   Thoughts and feelings and emotions come and go so quickly. The trail does that to a hiker. I handle the weight of my five day supply of food ok. Just go slow trudging uphill, and the miles roll by. I'm finally at the high point of today's hike, at Rich Mountain. I decide to take the side trail up to the lookout tower, an old forest service fire tower. The surrounding view is spectacular. A cellular tower stands a couple hundred feet away, so I'll try calling Yvonne. She answers standing in line at Mickey D's, to buy a couple salads.   As we talk I notice dark clouds to the west, so I hasten the conversation and give my love. I arrive at Spring Mountain shelter at 1:00pm. This shelter is a small and can hold perhaps five. This one of the oldest on the trail, built in 1938. I consider walking another 8.6 miles to the next shelter, but thunder rumbles ever closer. I rush to get water at the spring, and no sooner got back to the shelter when the skies opened up with pounding rain. I think I'll stay here for the night.","Elmer's Sunnybank Inn - Hot Springs

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461695,"Day 24. I slept well but the mice took the opportunity to chew a couple holes in my hiking shirt. I could hear them but I thought they would keep to themselves. Four gentlemen were camped about a mile North of Spring Mountain shelter. As I passed one asked how far I was going today. When I said Jerry's Cabin shelter he said, ""Whoa that's a long way. You better get going.""   15.4 miles to them seemed undoable. I saw no one else on the trail today, but a couple had spent the night in Jerry's Cabin, and had there stuff scattered all over the shelter. They are a local couple, and his grandfather took care of this shelter for years. He is a down home good ole boy. When they finally got packed up it started raining. She's going to hike the eight miles in flip flops. This shelter is right at the 300 mile mark on the trail. Only 168 miles to go.","Spring Mountain Shelter

I know the top of this mountain Jutes out into a grass covered bald, which will be soaked from last night's rain. I think I'll wear my waterproof socks and rain skirt. The trail skirted a civil war era grave of three young men, one was only thirteen. I took the time to say a prayer for them. The trail is noticeably tougher the last couple days. I was spent after yesterday's 15.4 miles. The Firescald rocks at mile 297 was a real obstacle course. Today there were a lot of ups and downs.   I completed the 14.7 miles by 2:00, and would have considered going farther, but the long climbs and rocks wore me out.  Luckily there is a 3G signal at Hog Back shelter, so I spend time chatting with Yvonne and checking my e-mail. I'm alone again tonight, and have seen only two people in the last three days. Snapper rolled in at 8:15. He hiked 30 miles today!   He only has 3 months to they hike the trail.    From the looks of his equipment, he's hiking even lighter than Ian. That's incredible hiking.","Jerry's Cabin Shelter

My original plan was to go 10 miles today, leaving 16.7 miles to Uncle Johnnies Hostel in Erwin the next day. But if I do 20 miles to No Business Shelter today, that leaves only 6.7 miles to the hostel. That way I can get there in the morning and have the day to regroup. The hike today goes over Big Bald Mountain, which is impressive with its wide open grassy top, and a view of a hundred miles in every direction. I always limit the water I carry since that's the single most heavy item a hiker carries. I plan my water from The AT Guide, which shows the springs and stream locations. What I didn't realize is Tennessee is now five inches short of normal. As I neared the 20 mile mark at No Business shelter, the listed streams were dry. I still had a liter with me, but not enough for dinner and breakfast.   I got to No Business shelter at 3:30. No water, no privy, no thank you. I'm already tired but the next 6.7 miles to Erwin is mostly downhill. I decide to go for it. I've never hiked 26.5 miles.   On top of the last mountain, the guide shows it being fairly flat, but actually it's a roller coaster of five steep ups and downs. What a killer.   On the final descend, fabulous views of Erwin appear through the trees. It's like being in a plane. When I step out onto the road on Erwin, Uncle Johnnies is the first beloved sight.

So many places in the southern Appalachian region just do no have wi-fi. I'm glad I came in last night, as that makes today a full zero day. I woke in the hostel knowing I don't need to walk today. My feet need the break. I can spread everything out on the lawn and sir out my quilt. After spending so much time in the mountains, is forgotten that it get hot here in the lowlands. It's going to top 90 degrees today. Snapper was also here last night, and he took off this morning for another 25+ miles. I went to the pizza house for lunch and had the buffet and salad bar. That should hold until dinner. The shuttle driver was good enough to run me to the post office so I could mail home two pair of socks that I haven't used. That will save me six ounces. Earlier this morning two women who stayed at the hostel left, with backpacks, to hike north. Later in the afternoon, the shuttle arrived with the two women. They said, ""We went three miles and decided our pack are too heavy. We're done.""   I struggled to lift one of the packs. We hung it from the scale, and it read 38.5 lbs. Five minutes before the shuttle to dinner left, Cary rolled in. Six of us went to the Los Jalepenos restaurant, where they serve jumbo frozen margaritas. I had one of those plus a regular sized. We ate our fill then walked to the Walmart behind the restaurant, to pick up trail supplies.With a good cell signal, I called Yvonne and talked for awhile. Tomorrow is our 47th wedding anniversary. We dropped Cary off at the Mountain Inn because they have a computer he can use to update his book. The computer at Uncle Johnnies is out of order.","Uncle Johnnies Hostel, Erwin Tenn.

All I had to do was dress, fix my breakfast of cherry turnovers in the microwave, close my pack and go.   I'm walking at 6:20am.   I see my sixth bear today. We are walking side by side with a row of rhododendron bushes between us so neither of us is aware of the other's presence. Suddenly the bush row ends, and we are both startled. We are close enough I could reach over and pet him, but he darts away at high speed. I know this is going to be a tough day, with a full resupply load, and mostly uphill all day. Sure enough, two one-thousand foot climbs leaves me beat by the time I get to Cherry Gap shelter. Mike arrives as I make dinner. About thirty, he is very outgoing, and does bar tending for a living.   His demeanor reminds me of my own son Chad. He said he saw me earlier on the trail, and tried to catch me but couldn't.   After seeing the contents of his pack, I told him that hikers usually don't carry showers, and two weeks supply of food. There are several hikers here, but they all choose to tent. I'll stay in the shelter tonight, as it makes for a quicker getaway in the morning.","Cherry Gap Shelter

It is slow going, I get there by 4:00. On the way up Roan Mountain, I noticed the fabulous job of trail work the maintainers have recent done. I'm amazed how they can move large stones into place to make steps going up the mountain. Roan High Knob shelter is totally enclosed, suitable for harsh weather. It is also the highest shelter on the AT, at 6190'.   The floor looked dirty so I set up my tent.   Just after I arrived, Kevin and Danny came in. They are both retired, and are out for a three day trip. Kevin was a school teacher, and was telling me he trades homes with people in Europe, for two weeks at a time.   There is a website where he finds couple wanting to vacation in the USA, and in turn he would vacation in Europe. Sounds like it works well. Dan is a retired railroad executive. They both are jovial and appear to be enjoying themselves. Together they are comical.    About 6:00 the skies open up and pours rain.

North of Carver Gap the mountain opens up Into clearings that yield incredible views that rival the Smokies, and stays open across Big Bald Mountain. Several artists with paint canvas and easels station themselves along the trail. On the way down I catch an older hiker named Hard Way. He is 66 and thru hiking. He started April 17 and is determined to make it to Maine. Like me, he's headed for the Mountain Harbor Hiker Hostel at mile 391.8. I arrive at 1:30 and devour a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I walk into the hostel and am surprised at seeing the two girls at Uncle Johnnies, who said they quit hiking. They shuttled ahead here to meet one of the girl's mother. This hostel actually has two showers and two flush toilets. Unusual for a hostel. Vagabond is a 71 year old lady who runs the hostel, and thru hiked the trail last year at 70. She also drives the shuttle to town. Hard Way finally shows at 4:30, in time for the 5:00 dinner bus to town.

I came upon Pick sitting in the trail. He's about 70, and asked me if the Mountaineer shelter was near. He got confused last night and wasn't sure where he was.   He is from Virginia, so I ask if he knew the transportation routes out of Damascus. I wanted to get to Lynchburg to catch the Amtrak home, but how to get to Lynchburg. Apparently the town of Bristol, just ten miles from Damascus, has a Greyhound terminal. Thank you Pick. I intended stopping at the campsite at mile 409, but Moreland Gap shelter was just 1.7 further. Good choice as strong winds and rain is in the air.

I did have a little trouble finding the trail north out of the gorge, so I had to backtrack up the hill before I finally found the switchback. There's nothing more refreshing than the trail coming right out on the public beach at Watuga Lake. That was unexpected. As I walked across Watuga Dam, I could see a group of people at the other end. As I approached the group took an interest in my hike. They are members of the Savannah Striders, a running club of folks my age. They offers me snacks and water, which I gratefully accepted. They even gathered around me for photos. My intention was to get water at the spring on the trail two miles before the shelter. The water at the shelter is four-tenths of a mile downhill from the shelter. No thanks, I'll carry the water from the spring on the trail. As I approached the spring, I see Karen sitting there. ""How did you get here?"", I asked. I had left her and her son at Black Bear this morning. ""I shuttled ahead"", she said.

The open grass fields were a refreshing change from the woods. The U.S. Forest Service owns the land but leases it to a local farmer. Hikers walk right next to grazing cattle, for an amusing change of pace. Uniformed US Forester Gilbert and his helper Mike were digging a fence post hole to keep cattle at bay. The terrain is fairly mild today so the 22.7 miles go by quickly, although it rains heavily the last four miles. At Abingdon Gap shelter are Bob, Donna with her dog Rudy, Theo, a young fellow with his fur covered razor blade German Pincher who has a violent bark, and Peter whom I passed on the trail earlier.Bob was taken with my gear, and asked how much my pack weighed. He bought all his gear in the 1990's, and says he needs to get lighter. I've heard that from countless people during this trip.

I proceeded to the far side of town and stopped at Crazy Larry's, who graciously welcomed me as a guest. The hostel is also Larry's home. For $30, you get a real bed with linens and a pillow, a shower and a real flush toilet, laundry done for you, and a great breakfast of eggs, biscuits, hash browns, and a pork chop. Larry takes care of everything as though every guest were his family. The AT passes on the road right in front of Larry's house, so hikers can't help but notice.

On Christmas Day, 2014, our daughter died in a one car accident.   I was convinced that I'd never hike again, and had no desire to keep living. My wife and I grieved deeply throughout the winter. I have never cried so much. Ridden with guilt, we both decided to seek professional counseling. That was the greatest gift we've ever given ourselves. We realized that we were not the cause of Sarah's death, and we needed to resume our lives. So it is just within the last month I decided that I need to balance my life, and to go walking is the best thing I can do for myself, and is part of my ongoing therapy.   My wife, though not a hiker, agrees.If anyone asks me why I'm hiking the trail, well I think my reason has changed from last year. It used to be just a physical challenge. Now, it's a way to heal my soul and spirit.So to the trail I'll return on May 12. I intend to go as far as Harper's Ferry this year God willing. I've saved my pack list from last year, and am very near ready to go. I've dehydrated my dinners, made up 4 drop boxes, and lightened my pack to a 9.5 lb. base weight. Hey, I'm 69 years old.

The trail leads through large open grassland that affords many choice campsites, then leads through thick spruce fir forests that give way to high rocky outcrops. Open views of the grasslands below with herds of wild ponies. The ponies were brought here in the 1970s to keep the grassland in check. A horse breeder developed these thick long haired colorful ponies capable of withstanding the harsh winters. The ponies are use to humans and are very friendly. They will make their way to any passing hiker to lick the salt from their skin and equipment. The trail out of the Highlands leads down to an old cattle scale that is now a public camping area. The only camper was Jack, who invited me over to chat with him a while. He offered an ice cold Mountain Dew, and I great fully accepted. Two young women thru hikers named Lightning Bug and Moon Bug had passed through Thomas Knob shelter yesterday afternoon while I was there. We passed each other several times today, and as they walked by Jack's camper I called out their names. They seemed surprised that I remembered their names. Jack offered them some Little Debbie cakes. This is known as trail magic, when anyone offers hikers free food and drink. They are getting off the trail today to go to the Trail Days celebration in Damascus, then are going to a wedding in Minneapolis. They will return to the trail in a couple weeks.

That calmed them considerably. Partnership shelter is unique among trail shelters in that it has a shower and an outside sink with city water.

They even have a Facebook page called Pack-It-Out. One hiker walked with a long grabbing device while another held a bag for the trash. I was impressed by their efforts.

The hostel is very clean, with plush mattresses, even in the bunkhouse. Neville also raises her own spices, vegetables, and fruits that she uses to make dinner and breakfast for guests. This seems more than the typical hostel. All guests pitch in and take part in making dinner and breakfast, setting the tables, washing dishes, changing the sheets on the beds, and sweeping the porch. Neville has a calming authoritative way about her; she can easily assign tasks to guest, who in turn feel they're helping in the communal setting. Meals are served family style with much conversation and laughter. I had planned to take a zero in Pearisburg tomorrow, but I think I'll take my zero here instead.

The first time I wasn't watching my footing and the toe of my shoe caught on a rock, and down I went. Twenty minutes later I did exactly the same thing. So now I've fallen three times on this section hike. Last year I never fell once. I attribute this misfortune to the shoes I've chosen for this year's hike. I had always chosen very light weight and thin shoes in the past. Such shoes enable one to be nimble of foot, but they are hard on the feet, causing blisters on my toes and heels.

I suspect I'm not eating enough on the trail, because the day after a town stop, I'll always feel stronger. For example, last evening I ate at the 3 lil' Pigs BBQ and feasted on pulled pork, a half a slab of ribs, hush puppies, onion petals, and banana cream pudding for dessert.

Then this morning it was eggs, oatmeal with raisins bagels, orange juice and coffee.   I normally always dread the day after re-supply, but even though my pack is now weighted down with six days of food, I felt strong enough through the day. Another reason I'm feeling well is I've made a discovery about my socks. I've worn wool socks throughout this hike but still developed blisters on my toes. At any one time I had three or four toes taped over broken blisters. Then last week I started wearing the toe socks I had put in my pack. Toe socks fit over each toe in the same way that gloves fit over fingers. My blisters started healing, and last night I removed the last of the tape. I will wear toe socks from now on. I stopped in for a break at Fullhardt Knob Shelter this morning, and a hiker there asked if I hiked last year. I then recognized him I had met at Uncle Johnie's Hostel in Erwin, from last year. It's amazing how many hikers I reconnect with even over a year. There seems to be an increased number of bear sightings lately, even though I haven't seen any yet.

I order the mountaineer breakfast which includes hot cakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, and toast, and I order a famed blackberry milkshake. Several new people showed up at Rock Spring this afternoon.   Two ladies, with trail names of Spider Woman and ...can't remember the other one. Spider Woman's real name is Helen. Helen told the story of how her husband suddenly died two years ago and the struggle she had with her own desire to live. She blamed herself for the situation, but she really had no control. I then relayed the story of Sarah's death and how I am dealing with guilt feelings. Of all the people I've met on the trail, Helen has helped me the most with Sarah's death.","Bearfence Mountain Hut

My intention today is to hike 13.3 miles the New Tripoli campsite where there is a good water source. I intended to keep the mileage low because of the incredibly pace slowing rocks. Nothing wears me out faster than these horrid Pennsylvania rocks. 
When I arrived at the campsite, it was only 12:20pm. There were indeed many stretches of rocks but there was also a few miles of smooth trail, and the trail had been smooth up to the campsite. I turned down the blue blaze trail, and it went down, down. I decided I'm not going to stay here and go for Bake Oven Knob shelter. It's only another four miles. But the rocks started again. What a killer. It took nearly three hours to go four miles. 
AWOL's guide indicates a restaurant close to the trail at mile 1243.2. I have visions of ice cold chocolate milk shakes and a sandwich. At the highway I can see the sign. I anxiously walk close enough to see the closed sign. Rats! Guess I'll settle for warm water. 
At the shelter my first task is to get water. The guide says if the first spring is dry, go another 0.1 to the next spring. If dry go another 0.4 to spring three. I go to spring one, it's dry. Spring two, it's running but slow. I spend an hour dipping water. 
Polar Bear comes in but he going on to the next shelter.
A scrapping sound wakes me around ten o'clock. I turn on the flashlight of my phone and look over the open edge of the shelter. A porcupine is busily gnawing the wood riser to the floor. He doesn't seem to mind that I am there. He stared into the light for a few seconds, then went back to his business. So if he leaves me alone, I'll leave him alone.","Eckville Shelter

Once past the relocation, the trail did get very rocky. My plan is to get off at 1262.1 and thumb a ride toward Danielsville, about 0.8 mile to the Blue Mountain Restaurant and Ice Cream. I hope there's enough traffic for a ride. I really don't want to walk any more today, it's too hot.   When I got to the road crossing an elderly gentleman named Blackie had pulled his SUV up to the trail, retrieved a large live trap out of the back, in which was a trapped squirrel. He explained that squirrels keep invading his bird feeders at home, so he traps them and releases them here. I ask him how far the restaurant is, which I already know, hoping he would offer a ride.   He said, ""oh, it's only about a mile, not too far"".   Not taking the hint, I said,"" I think I go out a see if I can thumb a ride"".   He finally offered to take me.   What a welcome sight. The restaurant has a pavilion in back where I can spend the night. The pavilion has electric outlets and lighting. I change my clothes and rinse out my hiking clothes under the hose at the rear of the restaurant. Inside, I quickly down two large chocolate milk shakes. Then order a jumbo dog with chili, and fries.

It is a cash only operation and there are several live in tenets. There is even a phone booth out front with a working phone. Does the phone company still support booths?My cab was early this morning. I came out of my room at 5:40am and there he was so I was at the trail by 5:50.   Many folks who live near the trail make their living shuttling hikers to and from the trail. It was another hot scorching day, 90 degrees plus. Since it is Saturday of Memorial Day there are a lot of day hikers climbing Mt. Minsi. out of Delaware Water Gap, a long two mile and arduous climb. Many of them are starting without water, and I warn several not to hike up without water.   The trail leads into town right next to an ice cream shop, not a common occurrence on the AT. I order two scoops of orange sherbet, and down it in minutes. Then I order it again. I walk across the street to the Church of the Mountain Hostel, run by the Presbyterian church.   This hostel is popular among hikers, and it is full when I arrive.   There are no more bunks left so I claim my spot on the love seat in the gathering room. A little short but very cushy. A man and wife in their upper 60s are here. They are doing a flip flop hike, starting in Harpers Ferry WV, hiking to Maine, then return to Harpers Ferry and hike south to Georgia. She is having painful issues with her ankles due to old scar tissue.   The Rock of Pennsylvania really aggravated her pain.   It is questionable whether she can continue. There is a barbecue downtown, and the older gentleman and myself go check it out. There are half chickens, pulled pork sandwiches, sausage and peppers, beans, corn on the cob; I can hardly decide I'm so hungry. I get a half chicken and the pulled pork. Many young hikers go out for pizza at 8:30pm, but most of us retire and turn the lights off.","Wind Gap - Travel Inn

So in an hour some are hiking out. I plan a shorter day, just 10.8 miles to the Mohican Outdoor Center (MOC). The day starts with a two mile road walk across the Delaware river and I-80. I just crossed I-70 three weeks ago.   In the pedestrian lane of the expansive bridge is a state border sign painted in the sidewalk.   Pennsylvania to New Jersey.   I pause, thinking I've just completed my seventh state.   Seven more to go. The last seven will come more quickly as the states are much smaller. New Jersey only has 60 miles on the AT.   There are still about 25 miles of rocks in New Jersey, but they should start to lessen. I arrive at the MOC by 12:30 and inquire about a bunk. It's a holiday weekend and they are full. The MOC is vehicle accessible so people come and spend the weekend going on short hikes. I retrieve my resupply box I sent a month ago, and restock my food bag. I order a BLT sandwich and sit in the dining room when other hikers begin to show up. I decide to move on to a campsite three miles further down the trail. The weather is still nice but the forecast promises rain for tomorrow.   I sit on a rock and heat water for dinner and my pot starts to boil over. I'm not paying attention. I grab the pot but lose my grip and spill all the water on the ground. Some lands on my shoe and burns my foot. Luckily I have an extra Esbit tab.

It rained hard all night, but my ZPacks Duplex tent kept me dry. What a great tent. 
I'm normally up early but the rain delayed my desire to get moving. By 6:00am the rain subsided so I pack everything up. 
By 10:00am the sun starts peeking through the clouds and the humidity becomes unbearable. I need to hike 17.9 miles to get to the Gren Anderson shelter. At mile 14.9 the trail crosses the highway that leads into Branchville New Jersey. I look to the left and I see the AT Deli. Next door is a Steakhouse, and then a gas station. I was excited thinking I can get whatever I want. I walked to the deli and the building was empty. I walked to the steakhouse but it is closed and for sale. The gas station sells nothing but gas. I asked the attendant in the booth by the pumps if they sell drinks. No, but I could get water from the restroom. 
I am alone at the shelter until 6:30. Cuffz and CQ are hiking southbound. He carries handcuffs and she is the Condiment Queen, picking up the little packets from gas stations. Their method is a little unorthodox. They started hiking the roads from Augusta Maine and picked up the trail in Hanover New Hampshire. They're hiking all the way to Florida and then plan ongoing to Puerto Rico. 
The pleasant acquaintance soon turns ugly. They become stressed with each other over trivial matters. She becomes upset because he's cooking supper, and feels she should do it. As he's cooking, he runs out of Sterno fuel. Now they are cursing at each other. 
Another female hiker had pitched her tent behind the shelter. She is young, attractive, and is from Germany, and brings with her the European sense of free sexual expression. She brings her food bag to the bear box (a heavy steel box to protect food from bears), wearing only a shirt and bikini underwear. She comes and sits on the edge of the shelter to introduce herself to Cuffz and CQ. Cuffz and CQ continue to bicker, and the young lady goes back to her tent. But now Cuffz follows her to her tent for a long while. CQ is so infuriated she packs her belongings to leave. Cuffz comes back to intercept CQ from leaving, and CQ lands a punch on Cuffz neck. They both go down the trail screaming at each other. Cuffz comes back alone. I say nothing.","Rattlesnake Tent Site

The walls are stone and someone has stacked eighteen inch long logs across the front leaving a small opening to get in.   There is a dark, dank appearance, and I see chipmunks running in the front. I do not want to stay here. My trail guide shows that the Murray Farm Shelter is another 5.4 miles, and the terrain is not difficult.   I am the first at the Murray shelter.

They are all part of the same crowd and hang together. They all wanted a place on the floor inside the shelter, but I assured them I will be the first one up this morning. I elected to moved outside and sleep on the porch.   At 4:30am this morning I didn't disturb anyone while I packed up.    As I started walking I could tell I needed a zero day. I haven't had a day off from hiking in two weeks. It turned out to be a relatively easy walking day and arrived at New Jersey route 94 by 11:30. Just as I stepped up on the highway a car was ready to pull out of the parking area across the road. I stuck my thumb out and he motioned for me to come across for a lift. The St. Thomas Church Hostel is the most caring place for hikers I've experienced. It is located in the basement of the church. The gathering room has a TV, a computer, a large futon which makes into a bed, another cot and three large easy chairs.   The next room is a large activity room with round tables and chairs. There is a laundry complete with detergent, and a bath with shower.   The kitchen, as most churches have, is setup to handle large gatherings of people.   The refrigerator is stock with food, ice cold watermelon and ice cream.    We are free to use all of this, but they only ask for a ten dollar donation, and the completion of several chores to keep the place clean. After I cleanup, I walk to the post office to pick up the box I mailed myself a month ago.   I also mailed home some clothes I no longer need with the warm weather. Next to the post office is the Acme Grocery. I think I'm going to change what I eat for lunch on the trail.   I've been eating my own blend of trail mix, some raisinets, and a nut bar.   This is either getting old, too much sugar, too much roughage, or a combination of all these. I bought tortillas, some foil wrapped tuna, and hard salami. For supper I walk to the pizza shop next door. Their sizes are small, 10"", or a 16"" large.   I don't think the small is enough so I order the large.   I bring it back to the hostel as other hikers drool.   I devour all but three pieces which I offer up to others.   Night comes early again.","Jim Murray Farm Shelter

The thru hikers I talk with don't seem to understand that there are other priorities in life other than hiking. I have to explain that the 4th of July is coming up and family commitments are important. I woke up relaxed this morning knowing I only needed to hike ten miles over Killington and resolved to cherish my few remaining hours.   Three quarters of the way up Killington I turned on my phone, and received a text from my neighbor back home. My wife Yvonne woke this morning with severe chest pains and called the emergency squad. She was taken to the Toledo hospital and is stable. Tests are being run to find the cause.   I did speak with her and she's sounds fine. I certainly did not expect this, and my train doesn't leave Rutland until Tuesday morning. I won't be home until Wednesday morning.   My immediate thought was don't enjoy the moment too much as it may get shot down by life's trials. An event like this certainly reminds me of life's important priorities of family. I exited the trail from the woods onto route 4 about noon, and the pavement was hot. I stowed my poles in my pack and immediately stuck my thumb out for a ride up the hill to the Inn at the Long Trail. This will be my third time staying here, as itis a relaxing and peaceful place to recover from the trail. I stayed in 2012 during my first Long Trail attempt, and again in 2013 during my SOBO LT end-to-end hike. My thanks to all who've followed this journal through these last two months.

Deacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568104,"From the previous page to now eleven months have passed and I am getting ready to pick up where I left off last year.  My return hasn't been certain at all.   Last July my wife Yvonne suffered through a pulmonary embolism, a dangerous blood clotting in the lungs.  She is a very strong person however and recovered well.  
On March 21, she underwent a total knee replacement and I was her total caregiver for a month.  I have new respect for anyone who cares for the sick.   Again, she seemed to progress very fast.  I did not make the decision to resume my hike until mid April, but as of now, it's a go.  This year will be my fourth of four sections to hike the entire 2189.8 miles of the AT.  I've already covered 1700.8 miles in 2014, '15, and '16 in roughly equal quarters.  This year will be the capstone of my hike as I start in Rutland Vermont and aim for the grand prize at Mt. Katahdin in Maine.  
In each of the past three years I didn't think the trail was overly difficult.   However I am apprehensive about the terrain in New Hampshire and Maine.  I've heard this will be the most difficult section of the trail.   The steepness of the mountains typically cuts daily mileage for hikers to a third.  I've had to rethink my clothing for the White Mountains with potentially the worst weather in the world.  I looked up the temperature records for Mt. Washington for July and August for the last three years, and the temperature never rose above 64 degrees and winds averaged 40 mph during the day.  
I've thought more of the threat of Lyme Disease that ticks carry, and now they carry an additional threat with the Powassen Virus, which has no known cure.   I've changed the amount of food I carry by increasing the number of food resupply drops.   
Dealing with all these concerns supposedly reduces my apprehension, but I suppose that is part of the allure.   Many other hikers successfully hike this trail, and I believe I will as well. 
This year I've put more effort into pre-hike training.   I drive daily to the Sandusky Perkins High School stadium, which has a very high set of bleachers, 54 steps to the top.  I have a large backpack (not the one I carry on the trail) loaded with several books, a concrete block, and a large 24"" iron pipe wrench, a total of 38 pounds.  With this pack, I walk the steps repeatedly, working the leg muscles as well as cardio workout.   I go up the 54 steps, right foot up, feet together, all the way up, then back down sequentially.   Then left foot up, feet together, all the way up then down again sequentially.   Going up twice, once on the right foot and once on the left, I count as one complete set.   My goal each day is to add one set.   I am now at 14 sets.   Hopefully I'll have some ready trail legs. 
For two months now I've prepared my food boxes, twelve in all, sending out the last one this morning.   Some drops are only two days apart.    Most hikers buy food on the trail, but I can eat better by preparing my own meals, which are more hearty than store meals, and a whole lot less sodium/preservatives.  
I believe I'm as ready as I can get.   Ive bought my Amtrak ticket for June 21st, for the 4:12am train to Rutland VT.   
 I don't do these hikes just to check off a bucket list, nor to take part in a hobby.   They are, rather, a means that allows me to thoroughly examine myself without the usual daily influences, routines, distractions, and the normal supports such as a roof over head.   It is more a retreat, drawing closer to God, and when that happens, I become more aware of my own failings.  My main daily concern is where will I lay my head tonight and where can I find water.   
That said it is all very joyful an am looking forward to sharing it with everyone.",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Sat",0

I had planned on driving our car and just leaving it at the train station, then my wife Yvonne would have one of her friends take her during the day to pick it up.   Two of her friends, Carol and Alice, decided they would love to pick me up at home and take me in exchange for some insights on how to live on the trail.  The chatting among us passed the time quickly.   As I boarded the train I turned and waved to them as they honked a fond farewell from their car.

The Yellow Deli is run by a group of people who live by a Native American based spirituality and philosophy.   I did not ask about their beliefs, nor did I wish to engage with them.  
Men and women live in common community on the premises, and all take a servant’s attitude toward customers of the restaurant and the hikers who stay at the hostel.   The women dress very modestly with a look of early American pioneer days, with unsettled long hair pulled back, and the men all have beards.  
Most notable is their exceeding kindness and gentleness toward each other and their customers, going out of their way to help them.   They are meticulous about everything they do, ensuring the quality of their efforts.   This is reflected in the healthy food they serve in the restaurant, and the caring attitude of the staff.   Hikers are fed a free breakfast in the morning, relying solely on donations.    A hiker cannot leave without feeling good about the place.   Even though there are twelve hikers here, the donations jar in the hostel didn't seem to have much money in it.   
I inquired about a shuttle to the trail, only to learn that the regional bus system has a route that will take me for two dollars.   What's more, the bus garage is right out the hostel’s back door.

Last evening two thru hikers came in.  They both are young twenty something and in incredible shape, and are doing 25 to 30 mile days.   That's the main advantage thru hikers have over section hikers, they get and stay in shape the entire hike.  Section hikers have to start from scratch every time they start a new section.  
I intentionally planed low miles and this is just my second day, and I am struggling.

I knew the Zimmerman's Clothing Store in Hanover would be open at noon today and having sent my resupply box there, I wanted to be sure I got there with plenty of time to spare.   I'm up at 4:00am, surprisingly the sky is already getting light.  I'm hiking by 5:00am and it's a beautiful calm morning.   It's 14 miles into Hanover from Thistle Hill Shelter so I want to keep moving.  
Coming off the trail onto Elm Street in Norwich, the town before Hanover, several residents have left trail magic by their driveways at the road, ice cold cans of Coke, fruit and cookies.  It's a two mile road walk to the Connecticut River, the Vermont New Hampshire border.  I am excited to finish my twelfth state.  Only two states to go.  
I walk into Hanover and Dartmouth College is on the left.  It is the oldest and one of the most prestigious colleges in America.  The streets are filled with young people with a certain air of New England classiness.  I walk down the street, looking for Zimmerman's.   
I walk in and the store manager is very amicable, and apparently is a hiker himself.  We talk while I sort my re-supplies into my pack.  He offers to charge my cell phone.   He offers to keep my pack in the store while I look about town and get something to eat.

As you can see above, I've now completed 80% of the AT’s total length.   It has been suggested by many others that the first 80% requires only 20% of the effort, and the last 20% requires 80% of the effort.  Now that I've been out here for five days, I firmly believe that.   
Today I had two 1500’ climbs.  That may not sound bad but the difference here is the steepness.     The trails run straight up the mountains.   Do the people of New Hampshire know what a switchback is?

 This morning I encountered the most amazing example of trail magic I've seen on the entire trail.    At Cape Moonshine Road at mile 1783.1, a trail angel named Carl The Omelette Guy has set up a small haven consisting of several tarps, under which is a Coleman stove, a table holding a variety of cookies, donuts, another with gallons of orange juice, tea, and water.  And then there is a cabinet holding dozens and more dozens of eggs.   On top of the stove is a kettle of hot coffee and a frying pan ready for cooking.   
As I approached this little respite in the woods, I see a sign that says, Welcome to the Whites, in reference to the White Mountains of New Hampshire.   Under the sign there is a vase of flowers, Carl is seated in a chase lounge reading.  Soft music emanates from under the tarp.   
Carl looks up and greets me with a big welcome.   I've just hiked for five miles and am ready for a break.   He asks if I'd like a hot cup of coffee, or orange juice.   Then asks if I'd like an omelette with peppers onions cheese, and as many eggs as I'd like.  He's not kidding.  He said the record number of eggs he's made for a hiker is 28!   Do I want to try breaking that record?   I settle for three eggs, and a pancake.   
Carl insists he will not take a donation.   He just wants to help hikers.   
That afternoon I make it to the Hikers Welcome Hostel.  Pack rat has converted a 1832 house into his residence, with an attached addition that house eight bunks upstairs an a community room below.    He's also built a fabulous separate bunkhouse next door in rustic style.  
There six of us here this evening and we order sandwiches from a local 7-11 store.  I turn in early.

This morning four of us decide to slack pack Mt. Mossilauke, the first of very formidable mountains in “the Whites”.  Slackpacking is not carrying everything in your pack, but only what is needed for the day, such as snacks and water.  
Mossilauke is definitely one to slack pack.  Both sides of the mountain is very steep, so much so one has to hang onto rebar set into the rock ledge in order to climb.   The mountain does moderate after a mile or so.   It climbs quickly up through deciduous forest, changing over to alpine spruce.    The trees become shorter and shorter from towering to head height, then eventually two feet high.  
Suddenly there are no trees at all, only grassed slopes. There are no more trees to mark blazes upon, and now the trail is blaze with rock cairns.  Cairns are unmistakable man made piles of stones in pyramid shape to mark the way.   The last thousand feet of mountain offers a full 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains, the majesty of which stirs the soul.   
The moment the trees disappear the wind howls ferociously and the temperature drops noticeably.    The summer tee shirt is quickly covered with a winter jacket and hood.   At the summit safety wells created by the forest service provide refuge for hikers caught in adverse conditions.  
I check my phone for cell service and as usual, is very good at high elevations.  I am able to FaceTime with my wife back home, and shoe her the mountain in real time as I walk.   
Hostels are the most interesting places to stay.   Around the community table are hikers from Florida, Michigan, Indiana, Germany, and France.  We trade stories from the AT as well as abroad.","NH25 - Hikers Welcome Hostel

I've made such good friends at the Hikers Welcome Hostel the last three days, it's difficult to say goodbye.    Packrat drove five of us to Kinsman Notch, from which I will continue north.  
It is only 7.5 miles from The notch to Eliza Brook Shelter, my next planned stop.  I intentionality reduced mileage because I've heard the Whites are quite difficult.    I found out today they are difficult indeed.   
I always timed my mileage to be between 2.25 to 2.75 mph, but this terrain cuts that drastically.   Today I averaged 1.25 mph.    Halfway through today's hike, the rain began lightly, just enough to make the rocks slippery.   
I finally got to Eliza Brook, stepped into the stream, filled my water containers, and walked to the shelter at 1:00pm.  Over the next two hours the rain intensifies.   Two southbound era come in, and 3 northbounders as well.   As the afternoon progresses, we begin to hear a roaring sound.  We thought at first it was thunder, but was too constant.   
The Brook had turned into a raging river, rising 6 to eight feet.   Some other tenters have to move as the rising waters threaten their sites at the rivers edge.  If the water does not recede tonight, I will not be able to continue tomorrow.     
In the shelter two of the northbounders are from France.   One is Froggie, whom I met at the Hikers Welcome Hostel, and the other is a young lean fellow.  The two of them laugh, review trail maps, and converse in French through the evening.","Kinsman Notch

As I awoke this morning, the sky looked brighter for sure, though I could still hear the stream.   I’m amused that the stream is called a brook.   After I packed up the first thing I had to do was cross Eliza Brook.   I stood st the edge and the thundering water was frightening.   The rocks were sticking up above the rushing water, so I judge it is not too deep.   With my socks and shoes on, I inch my way into the torrent, always facing upstream.    The water never is above my knees, so obviously the water level has receded since last evening.   
My shoes squish dry as I head up the trail.   Today I climb Kinsman Mountain.   This is by far the most difficult climb on the entire AT so far.  It take all of three hours to climb three miles to the peak.   When I reach the top, it is just barely above tree line but heavy fog and clouds prevent what I'm sure is a great view.   
As i move across the ridge I come to the first of the AMC’s (Appalachian Mountain Club) alpine huts, Lonesome Lake.   These huts are amazing.    They are like a motel/restaurant set high in the mountains.   Guests pay $140/night for the right to hike up, have a full fledged dinner and breakfast, then hike down.   
They are kind to hikers.  Any hiker that stops in midday can have leftover breakfast food, including pancakes, hot soup, various pastries.   
There is no electricity here; all kitchen preparation is by gas.  I stop in and enjoy a bowl of cream of potato soup, a couple peanut butter balls, and many glasses of lemonade.   As I eat one of the staff informs me that a foot bridge was washed out on the AT at Cascade Brook, and I should consider an alternate route.   She said to take the Dodge cutoff trail down to the Pemi trail.  All this would take longer.   
As I left the hut, there was a side trail, but it was not named  “Dodge”, so I stayed on the AT.  After a while, I suspect that was the recommended alternative, but I'm not going back.   
As I approach Cascade Brook, it is apparent it is even more vicious than Eliza Brook was.   I can see why alternates were suggested.  I decided to try crossing.  
I stepped in, facing upstream,   Trying the next step with my hiking pole first.  It went too deep.   So I moved upstream about ten feet and tried again.  This time the protruding boulders were close enough I could steady myself on them.   Gradually I moved across.   I don't think the crossings are as frightening as the thunderous sound makes them seem.   
My goal today is the Notch Hostel, and my pickup point is at the Flume Visitors Center.  The AT comes off the mountain onto a paved bike path, which leads to the Center.   It is Fourth of July weekend, and there are hundreds of tourists here.  I sit on a sunny bench drying my socks as I await my ride to the Hostel.   I am scraggly looking, wet, and smelly.   I certainly don't fit in with the tourists.   
Bookie arrives to pick me up.  She is super friendly, graced with colorful tattoos, and is a past thru hiker herself.   At the Notch Hostel, I see familiar faces from the trail and we share stories for the evening.","Eliza Brook Shelter

Last evening a few of us hikers were discussing strategy for walking the Whites.  The 10.3 miles from Franconia Notch to the Garfield Shelter, based on previous days hikes, seemed too aggressive.  So this morning, I climbed out of the notch to the Liberty Springs Tent site.  From the drop off point this is only four miles, but the remaining seven miles tomorrow will be much more enjoyable.   
Halfway up the trail out of the Notch, I had still another stream to ford.   This time I took off my socks and forded with just my shoes.   
When I checked in with Rachael the caretaker, she did not charge me the fee, since I bought AMC’s orange card.  You pay $10 for the card at the first pay site, then it's only $5 for the next time one stays at a pay site.   Additionally, the card is good for free soup and cookies at the Huts.  
The ten tent sites are all wood platforms, as it would be impossible to pitch a tent on the steep terrain.  Before I left to hike, I bought six little screw eyes, and they have proved useful for holding lines such as on a platform.   
Rachel tells me all platforms will be full tonight since this is the holiday.","Franconia Notch - Notch Hostel

The morning is cool so I put on my long sleeve silk top under my wool tee, and my polypropylene long underwear, under my shorts.   This is summer, right?   Today I climb Little Haystack, Mt. Lincoln, and Mt.  Lafayette.  As soon as I got above tree line, dark clouds hit the mountains and the wind surely was 100 mph. 
Of course cell phone reception is excellent at 5800’ so I FaceTime Yvonne at 7:30 in the morning.  She is still in bed but takes the call.   She is amazed at the mountains and the wind blowing so hard.  FaceTime is a wonderful way to share the moment.  
I realize I am getting close to Galehead Hut and it is close to 3:00 pm, the earliest the Hut “croo” will accept hikers who wish to work for stay.   I timed my arrival for 3:05, hoping I wouldn't be turned down.  Arrive too early, and the hiker will be refused.   
The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) runs eight huts across the White Mountains, and this is the first I've seen.   The Huts operate on solar electric lighting which keeps batteries charged.  In the event of several cloudy days, there USA propane generator.   The restrooms are very nice, though the toilets are composting type.  They are clean enough I didn't mind sitting on them.  
They have a full kitchen capable of preparing dinner and breakfast for all guests.   A helicopter lifts propane tanks in the spring each year.    Meals are served at long picnic style tables.  Sleeping arrangements are bunk beds.   For all this the guest will pay approximately $140 for the evening. 
As a work for stay hiker, I am obligated to perform some task the croo chooses, usually lasting 30 minutes.  My task tonite is to wash some pots and pans from the evening meal.   
Dinner is served at seven for the guests, but the three of us hikers have to wait until all the guests are finished, so we eat at 8:00.   
Neither do we get a bunk to sleep in.  9:30 is “lights out”.   Just before we lay out our mats and sleeping bags on the floor under the dining tables.    I didn't mind the floor at all; it gave me room to sprawl.   
Not a bad deal for hikers.","Liberty Spring Tent Site

We also are entitled to a free breakfast, but the guests are served at seven, and the hikers have to wait around until 8:00 am to eat.   I need to make some miles today so I choose to leave early, at 6:00am.   The hiker assigned the morning chore must wait around.  
I am planning my way through the Whites, and I need to get to Crawford Notch.    I make it by 4:00.   I plan to stealth camp near the highway.  One of the other hikers at the Hut, a southbounder, told me about this site.  I am near the highway but the traffic sounds don't bother me.","Galehead Hut

I almost dread today because it will be eleven miles uphill. I hope to make it to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut.   The first two hours up from Crawford Notch were brutal but the rest of the day was above tree line and was so spectacular, it was truly enjoyable.   
The alpine region reminds me of a moonscape, and the open view of the mountains have an ecosystem of their own.   The naturalist at the Hut explained that tiny low growing plants survive in high winds.   
The climate at Crawford Notch this morning was much like Ohio, warm and muggy.   The higher I climbed, the humidity left the air and the temperature dropped.   On the high summits, temps were in the low 60’s.  Thankfully the winds today were very light.   
I arrived at the Hut around 2:00 wet from sweat, and I chilled very quickly.  None of my clothes seemed enough, nor did the two bowls of bean soup I bought.  
As do most Hikers do, I asked to do a work for stay.  But feeling the need to lie down, I decided to spring for a bunk, which also gets me hot dinner and breakfast, and I don't have to work.  
As I was eating dinner, I felt sorry for the Hikers sitting in the corner waiting for their turn to eat the leftovers.  I retire early, and glad to be in safe from the wicked weather that can turn at any moment.   The sun is setting beautifully but there is a heavy black cloud over Mt. Washington.   I'm headed up there tomorrow morning.","Crawford Notch

As the morning light grew stronger, I looked from my bunk out the window to check the weather.     The high summits have a way of changing quickly.   I grew concerned that I couldn't see anything but fog, and a whistling wind.   I finally got up and walked outside and was surprised to find just a few clouds, and calm winds.  Looks like the day will be ok after all.  
After a Hut breakfast of oatmeal, bacon and eggs, I was ready to go.  The walk up Mt.  Washington seemed so dramatic; I've been watching the weather observatory towers for miles as I approached.  On reaching the summit, I felt a little let down seeing a restaurant, a parking lot, and of all things today, there were car races on the motor road.   The inaccessibility of the summit, and the accessibility of the road just don't seem to mix.   
The White Mountain alpine region is truly a sight to behold, but hiking through it will destroy anyone's knees.   Just 10.3 miles from Lakes of the Clouds Hut to the Osgood Tenting site made me ache to high heaven.   I glad tomorrow is a short five miles to Pinkham Notch and the Joe Dodge Lodge.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

A lot of the concern I have during this hike is whether I have the ability to complete what I started. Yesterday was very challenging and this morning I felt extremely worn out, not having enough time to recuperate.   Thankfully from the Osgood Tent Site to Pinkham Notch is only 4.5 miles downhill.  I arrived at the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center in enough time for their all-you-can-eat breakfast.   So today is really a nero day.   
I asked to get into my room early at the Joe Dodge Lodge, but they refused until 3:00 pm.  
I sat on the center’s porch looking at the mountains across the road, and wondered to myself, “am I able to do this hike?”   As I look at my AT Guide, the next section is the Wildcats and Carter Dome.   The elevation change is steep and crazy.   I actually had thoughts of quitting, it was too difficult.  
One of the other hikers said she was going to ride the gondola car to the peak B of Wildcat, then go from there.  I considered riding up, then slack back down to the lodge, then ride up again with my pack and continue on.  
It always help to eat well, and the Lodge provides dinner with the room.   Dinner was baked chicken, root vegetables, sautéed whole mushrooms, and various breads.   
I now have a confession to make.   A week ago at the Eliza Brook Shelter, I left that morning and totally forgot my nice $180 Packa raincoat.   It finally occurred to me halfway up Kinsman Mountain.    Kinsman is so difficult, I said I just can't go back and get it.   At the top of Kinsman I phoned Yvonne and asked her to mail my other rain jacket to the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center.  That means I went four days above tree line with no rain coat.  Had I gotten into trouble, the New Hampshire rescue crew would've made me pay for my rescue because I was ill prepared.   Fortunately not a sign of rain during those days.   
Went to bed early to recoup my legs.","Osgood Tent Site

At breakfast this morning Stumbles-a-lot said she was still going up on the gondola, but we found out it doesn't start running until 10:00 am.  Her husband looked at me and said, “come on let's hike it together.   So the two of us crossed the highway and started up Wildcat.  
After all the rest I got last night I actually felt good this morning.  We worked our way up the mountain and got to the upper gondola platform 15 minutes before it started for the day.   I really felt good about that.   He stayed behind and waited for his wife, and I went on.   
After a stop at Carter Notch Hut for a bowl of potato soup and brownies, I continued on, more confident in myself.   My goal today is 13 miles to the Imp Campsite, especially since the last portion of the day’s hike is downhill.  
The last two miles started down, but soon became so steep, I was sliding down rock precipices fearing I might lose footing.   The day’s hike beat my legs up again.  
I got to the campsite at 6:00pm, ate, and retired in the shelter in a cold wind.","Pinkham Notch Visitors Center

As hikers sit around and talk of their experiences, at least three of us intend to buy knee braces at Walmart.   The Whites certainly took their toll.   
A lady I've seen frequently through the Whites has the name Soul Flower.  I would guess her to be in her late sixties, yet she seems to hike at my pace.   She is here at the Hostel, and I notice the good quality of food in her diet.   Other hikers are ordering pizza, beer, or are eating Ramen.      On the hostel’s run to Walmart for resupply, she came back with bread butter, tomatoes, kiwi, blueberries among other items.  
That made me examine my own diet to include less junk food.","Gorham Rt. 2 / White Mountains Hostel

Woke this morning in the shelter to heavy rain.   The couple who are sectioning are not to be deterred so they pack up, put on their raincoats and head out intending to hike 9.6 miles to Full Goose shelter.   After they leave, the rain intensifies and the wind and fog moves in.  
I put on rain pants, coat, and gloves, and leave the shelter fifteen minutes later.   At the first stream crossing, the couple clearly are uncomfortable and are underdressed.   They decide to bale out, taking a side trail down to a road crossing where they catch an AMC shuttle. 
I climb to the top of Mt. Success, which goes above tree line into the alpine region, and the driving wind, rain, and fog is daunting.  Stopping for very long could result in hypothermia.   There is so much water on the trail, I am walking through ankle deep water.  
I arrive at Full Goose shelter around 5:00 pm. There are seven hikers here and everyone is soaked.  Gear and clothes hang from nails throughout the shelter.   Everyone tries to get warm in their sleeping bags.","Gentian Pind

I consider the hardship of hikers back in the 1950’s and 60’s, without the aid of hostels, that have sprung up over the years.   I am so grateful for the many hostels, and tonight I'm staying at Pine Ellis in Andover Maine.  Like most Hostel proprietors, Naomi is very welcoming and accommodating.   She sets up slackpacking for several sections of the trail, so hikers don't have to carry heavy packs through difficult sections.  I return each afternoon and shower and launder clothes.   
I've slacked two sections and will again tomorrow, tackling Old Blue Mountain.   The driver at the hostel will deliver the rest of my gear at Maine Rt. 17, then will hike 3 miles to Sabbath Day Pond shelter.

There are four of us who will ride to South Arm Road and head north.   Terminator, Trail Snail, The Grateful Dad, and myself.  Terminator goes ahead as he is fast.  Grateful Dad and I hike together through the day.   Trail Snail lags behind due to an injured rib.   
Grateful Dad and I are slackpacking for 13.1 miles to Maine Rt. 17, where we've arrange to have the rest of our gear delivered at 3:00.   We walk along sharing stories about ourselves.  He tells me about Mike Sadler, the punter for Michigan State who was courting Grateful Dad’s daughter, as became a familiar face around his house.  As he was telling me this, he mentioned that exactly one year ago, Mike lost his life in a car accident.  He said that really affected everyone.   
I said, “yeah I know all about that sort of thing”, and told him about my 34 year old daughter Sarah.   Sarah died in a car accident on Christmas Day in 2014.  He was hiking behind me and I heard his voice crack and was weeping.   As we walked along he remembered a poem read at Mike’s funeral, an excerpt from Dr. Zhivago called the World is You.   It touched me so deeply I stopped, turned around an we hugged each other.   I've never had anyone touch my life like he did this day. 
We hike well and arrive at 2:20 hoping the driver would arrive early.   There is a scenic pull off where we wait.  3:00 comes, no driver.   3:30 I call, only to be ensured the driver’s on her way.   Finally at 4:45 our packs arrive.   The driver apologized but construction and an accident held her up.   
All the while we waited the weather turned from beautiful sunny skies, to dark threatening thunderstorms.   As she pulled away pellets of rain and wind sting my cheek.   
There were lots of visitors at the pull off area, and many were interested in our hike. People would stroll by and ask us questions.    “Are you hiking the whole trail?”    “When did you start?”   “Is that your pack?”  “How much does it weigh?”    
As we sit there entertaining passers by, i told Grateful Dad to watch my Yogi-ing skills.   To Yogi anything from people is a reference to the Yogi Bear cartoon character, who had an art of relieving people from their food and drinks.  
As I talk I say, “Do they have drinking fountains here?”   
“Oh, are you thirsty?”  Immediately we are offered bottles of water.   One lady gave us oranges.   
I could say,  but did not, “Yeah we have to carry lightweight food, and sometimes it's not enough“.    Then we would be offered candy bars, fruit, etc.  People love to offer what they have.

This is supposed to be an easy 9 miles to Rt. 4 and the Hiker Hut, but yesterday was so intense,  I barely have the strength.   I am really getting fed up with all the mud and water on the trail, but I know there is nothing I can do about it.  I waste a lot of time negotiating a way around the mud.   I finally take the “freedom step”, and walk right through the middle, sometimes sinking to my ankles.  This proves to be much faster, and I arrive at Rt. 4 at noon.  
The Hiker Hut is unique among hostels, as it is set up more like a camp.  There are several small cabins, and a slightly larger bunkhouse.  There is no electric so to charge a phone, I plug into the owner’s van.  
Steve and Katherine Lynch own the Hut.   On arrival, a sign requests the hiker to ring a bell as I enter the compound.   Steve immediately greets me and offers a bottle of Gatorade, some chips and salsa.  
Steve had to show me how the shower works.  He leads me down a path to an area next to the stream, from which he bails a pail of water.  There is an on-demand gas hot water heater mounted on a 4x4” post, and a small pump connected to a battery to pump the water out of a tub to the shower head.   I have to turn on a switch on the heater and the pump.   This whole affair makes a scalding hot shower if one desires.   The is hidden from the path by a curtain between two trees, otherwise the area is open.   
Grateful Dad comes in an hour after I arrive.  About 2:00 Steve drives us into Rangel, the nearest town 8 miles away.  After some short looking at the stores, we head to the Parkside Restaurant and their outside deck that overlooks a bay on a lake.   
Grateful Dad and I sit at an umbrella table and chat, as we sample the beer from local breweries.  He is an attorney from Michigan, a little younger than me, and we talk a variety of subjects, including our religious backgrounds and all that's going on in our lives.   
The hiker appetite is quite real.   I order a lobster roll dinner with fries and coke slaw.   When the waitress asks if we would like desert, I order buffalo chicken wings.  
Our pickup point in town is the ice cream place, with walk up style service.   I order a large caramel sundae, and as we sit at the table, a large crowd of twelve or so gather and spot my AT hat.   They are intrigued by our hike and ask all the usual questions about trail life.  
Then I order another large caramel sundae.  When we return to the Hiker Hut, Steve offers a big slice of blackberry pie, and Katherine offers chocolate brownies, which I indulge.  Grateful Dad then pulls out a package of the new mocha Oreo cookies.

 As I awake I look out toward the fire pit and Steve has started a fire.  I step outside and Katherine offers a cup of coffee, then Steve makes fried egg sandwiches for everyone who stirs.  
Grateful Dad is jumping ahead 30 miles to Stratton to meet his friend from Michigan.  The two of them plan to finish hiking to Katahdin together.   I am sorry to see him go.  He was a great companion for the short time I knew him.  I promise to send him my summit photo at the end of my hike.   
I am glad I decided to take a zero day.  I am still sore from the past few hiking days.  I spend most of the morning dosing in bed; it is so quiet and peaceful here.  
I ask Catherine if she has an AT Passport stamp.   Catherine draws her own in the passport book.  She does a remarkable likeness of the Hut, with very fine and precision pen work.  
Steve takes me to town (Rangely) where I go back to the Parkside Restaurant and enjoy the day on their outside deck.

Felt good today after a zero yesterday.  Steve's fried egg sandwich really stays with me.  
The views above tree line in Maine are phenomenal, and Saddleback, the Horn, and Saddleback Junior prove the point.   
I set up my tent on the road bed just above Orbeton Stream.  This roadbed is the supposed place that Geraldine Largay took when she disappeared four years ago.   It's a little disconcerting to think she walked this road, only to be lost, and she eventually died.  
I walked past Poplar Ridge Lean-to, the last place she was seen alive.   Her picture was mounted inside the Shelter.","Rt. 4 Rangely- The Hiker Hut

High altitude tent sites are nice as they are breezy with low humidity.  I slept well in my tent.  
Today I finally reached the 2000 mile mark on the trail.  Someone created a 2000 made of twigs on the ground.  Even it it wasn't the exact spot, it was good to celebrate it here.  
On the way down to ME27, I met Medicine Man, a retired pharmacist from Georgia who decided to hike the trail.   He asked me how I planned to get to Stratton, five miles to the west.   I held out my thumb.   I think he wasn't sure about hitchhiking.  After all he's a professional man, and sticking his thumb out may feel like a vagrant on the move.   
I told him that people know we're hikers here.   I said, “you just need to be transparent.  Just tip your hat back so they can see your face, don't wear sunglasses, and smile.   He said, “I'll watch you.”   I walked to the other side of the road, and about the fifth car stopped to pick me up.   
About five minutes after I walked into the White Wolf Inn, Medicine Man walked in.  I said, “see how easy that is?”   
Stratton is a very small town.   Seems like the further north I get on the trail, the more remote and smaller the towns.   However on this day, is a gathering of motorcycle enthusiasts are in town gathered around a stage concert directly across the street from my motel.   Motorcycles run the street blaring loud exhaust.  I hope they don't party too late.

Trail Snail, Moving Target and I met at the picnic table at the Stratton Hostel at 7:00 to catch the free shuttle to the trailhead on ME27.   We were quiet during the ride, as this was going to be a rough day with a lot of steep climbs.  Today, the Bigelow Range.   South Horn, West Bigelow Peak, and Avery Peak.   
Even though it was a long climb, the day was clear and cool, and the views were fantastic/awesome.  Maine is indeed beautiful.   
I had planned on staying at the Avery Tent Site, but chose to push on to the Safford Notch Campsite.    Today's distance is 10.4 miles, but very difficult miles.   Hopefully today ends the tortuous Southern Maine.   From here on the terrain should calm down.   
A couple of tenths from the Safford Notch Campsite side trail, a southbound gentleman asked how far is the next lean-to.   I said the last lean-to was Horns Pond.  It's seven miles over the Bigelow peaks.   It's 2:30 now, and will take 4 hours of hard hikiI advised him to stay at Safford Notch.   He agreed.","ME27 Stratton- White Wolf Inn

After I left Safford Notch and neared the top of Little Bigelow Mountain, I lost the trail and found myself suddenly unable to find the trail.  I walked around ten minutes confused.  I checked Guthook’s app, and it showed I was nearly on the trail.   The terrain is so rough I couldn't go the direction the app indicated.    I finally found the pine needle trail that led me astray and backtracked.   I had walked right past a switchback.   
I got to West Carry Pond Lean-to about 12:30 after 12.6 miles.  Too early to stop.  I could go another ten miles to Pierce Pond, but it looks like rain.   I decide to stay in the lean-to.   Rain starts about 1:00 so that was a good choice.   It's nice to be in the shelter when it's raining.","Safford Notch Campsite Mile 2012

Only 155 miles to Katahdin.   I never thought about how close I was as all my energy was dealing with each day's climbs.   At this point, I'm out of the difficult southern Maine section, evidenced by today's lazy ten mile leisurely walk to Pierce Pond Lean-to.  
I arrived at noon, and the Kennebec River ferry is only another 3.8 miles, but I'm not going to play beat-the-clock.    The ferry, a canoe, is free between 9:00am and 2:00pm.   This way, I'll leave here at 7:00 tomorrow morning and meet the ferry at 9:00.  
This will give me a nero day (nearly a zero) at the Caratunk bed & breakfast on the other side of the river.  
Word on the trail is there is a sport camp down a blue blaze trail where we can get breakfast in the morning.   We have to go tell them the night before however.  Medicine Man, Ryan, Moving Target, and Trail Snail will also go in the morning.  So at 6:00 this evening I put my hiking clothes back on and Moving Target and I walked the 0.3 mile to the camp where we met Tim, who owns and runs the camp.   
For nine dollars we get 12 pancakes, four raspberry, four blueberry, and four peach.   They come red white, and blue.   For another three dollars, we can also have eggs and sausage.   Now that's a hiker breakfast.

It was a gorgeous night sleeping on the hill above Pierce Pond.  The five of us planning to go to Harrison's Sport Camp for breakfast are eager to get going by 6:15 am.   
Tim Harrison was an Actuarial Consultant for an insurance company in Boston for eighteen years.   He grew tired of the fast pace and decided to open this incredible respite in the woods.  
Trail Snail, Moving Target, Medicine Man, Ryan, and myself sat down at the dining table.  The floor obviously slants one way, and we joke about it.  At 7:00 am sharp, as promised, Tim brings each of us a stack of twelve pancakes, and a plate of eggs and sausage.  Everyone is quiet and we have no trouble finishing the breakfast.  
It's only 3.7 miles to the Kennebec River Ferry, actually a canoe.  It is the official route of the AT across the river.   We sign a release form and don a life jacket, and Mike the Ferryman paddles us across.   Medicine Man is paddling in the bow.   
Medicine Man and I cross the highway and walk to the Caratunk B&B and Hostel.   Paul greets us, offers a milkshake and a pulled pork sandwich.   Paul keeps a well stocked resupply of all the usual hiker food in the basement.  
I feel somewhat antsy for taking the day off since it's a beautiful and cool day, great for hiking.  However I'm seeing my limitations and am aware of the rest I need to keep going.  I'll take the rest of today off.  
Paul Fuller, owner of this Hostel, is a genteel person, soft spoken, and very giving.  He doesn't normally make dinner for guests, but because there is only me and one other person, he makes us huge cheeseburgers with lettuce and tomato.   I have blueberry pie with ice cream for desert. 
Paul is a 10,000 mile hiker of various trails.  He's 78 now, has hung up his boots, and wants to give back to serving the hiker community by operating this Hostel.","Pierce Pond Lean-to

Typically Hostel owners are good cooks, and Paul is no exception.  The four of us that stayed last night woke up to a breakfast of egg omelettes made with broccoli and cheese, fried potatoes, and blueberry muffins, and coffee.   
It rained last night and I could hear it on the metal roof outside.   I did not want to get up and start hiking.   I was sure I'd stay another day.  But after breakfast I forced myself to hike on, and I'm glad I did.   The day’s weather turned decent.   
About mile 2050, the trail followed a gravel road, and about a hundred yards down, a man and two frisky dogs appeared from the side.    One of the dogs ran at me as fast as he could, barking and snarling.  I bent down and held my hand down in a submissive gesture, but the dog circled me while growling.    Only then did the owner holler for his dog.   He said, “sorry about that”.    Don't know why he waited so long to call his dog.

First item of the day was to climb Moxie Bald Mountain.   The summit was very breezy and foggy, but I could see clear skies coming.   Had a little trouble finding the trail from the summit sign.   It's a little misleading because the summit sign is just off the trail.   Thanks to Guthooks app, I found the way.  
Up to today, all the rivers noted in AWOL’s ATGuide as a “ford”, that is, one must wade across the river, were low enough to rock hop across them.  Today I had to ford the West Branch of the Piscataquis River.  We haven't had heavy rain for some time now, so the ford was only knee deep.   
I got to Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to at 1:00 pm, and was real tempted to go on.  Even so I decided to stay.","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to

Another perfect weather day.   Only nine miles into Monson so I get started at 5:30 am and arrive by 10:30 at the highway.   The staff at Shaw's Hostel are glad to pick me up at the highway.   
Shaw's is a big old house with large rooms.  The upstairs has two full baths and four bedrooms.    My room has space enough for seven beds, and is where I bunk.  There are two other buildings as well.   In all Shaw's can host up to forty people.   
To my surprise, Moving Target, Trail Snail, Medicine Man, Soul Flower, and Firesocks are here.   I thought they would be ahead of me, but decided to zero here.  
Tomorrow I start the hundred mile wilderness, and four of us have arranged for Shaw's to deliver the last four day's of food to us at mile 2133, Jo-Mary Road.  The charge to deliver is $80, but the four of us will split the cost.   
Medicine Man and I go to the Lakeshore House for lunch and we order fish dinners.  Then we go next door to Petes Place for blueberry pie and ice cream.   
Later at 5:00, five of us go to the Bar-B-Q place and I eat a full rack of baby back ribs.

Poet, the owner, takes Medicine Man and I to the trail head at 8:15, a rather late start for us, but we didn't want to miss breakfast.   
The weather is perfect, sunny but cool.  Our goal is to hike 15 miles, as this first day is not too difficult.    The trail is very root filled and some rocks, but dry.   It rolls up and down and gives us a good workout.   Our goal, Lone Pond Lean-to, has few tent sites and no water.  We decided to camp on a woods road 1.7 miles short of the lean-to.","ME15 - Shaw's Hostel - Monson

Medicine Man and I agreed to be ready about 6:15 this morning, but we both were ready at 5:45.   In order to meet our food delivery on day 5 at Jo-Mary Road, we need to make some miles today.   
After we got started we caught up with Soul Flower about 10:00.   She wants to hike the same 17 miles we're planning today, but she tends to hike slower.    I hope she can make it.  
This was a tough day, hiking over six mountains.   There was Barren Mt., Fourth Mt., Three and a Half Mt., Third Mt., Columbus Mt., and Chairback Mt.  The tops of all the mountains are covered with wild blueberries.    They are small but loaded with flavor.  
On our way down to the Pleasant River, a thunderstorm popped and got things a little wet, just enough to make everything damp.   We changed to our crocs, forded the river, and tented near the river for the night.","Woods Road at 2088.7

After last evenings rain we woke to sunny skies, but had to pack up a lot of damp equipment.  Medicine Man and I got started early again at 6:15.  Always great to get an early start.   
This should be the last tough day on the trail.   Today we climbed four mountains, the last being White Cap.  We rounded the bend at the top and there it is!   Katahdin.   It looks so close, yet it's still 72 miles away.   It is a massive presence that's beautiful and frightening.  
We hiked down to Logan Brook Lean-to, only to find the place taken over by a group of young people.   We collected our water for the evening and continued down the trail about 200 yards and found some tent sites just off the trail.

I'm feeling tired and worn, by all the steep climbs of the last two days.   Thankfully the big climbs are over (not counting Katahdin).  The trail today was kinder and gentler, although Little Boardman Mountain presented a challenging little climb.  It was all downhill though to Cooper Brook Lean-to.   
We happened upon a fellow standing on the side of the trail with a large pack on the ground.   He was waiting for his son to arrive southbound, to give him a food resupply.   As we proceeded on northbound, we didn't see anyone looking for a resupply.   That gentleman is going to have a long wait.  
Cooper Brook has a fascinating cascade in front that runs down to a quiet pool that's great for swimming.   I couldn't resist, it was so enjoyable. 
We only walked 11.7 miles today and arrived at noon, but we can't go any farther since our food delivery is just 3.5 miles north on Jo-Mary Road.   So we spend the afternoon relaxing.","Logan Brook Lean-to

Hundred Mile Wilderness - Day 5
The day started off a beautiful morning.   Four of us are planning to pickup our 9:00 am food delivery from Shaw's Hostel, at Jo-Mary Road.  The trail is so easy to walk on we arrive at 7:40.   Shaw's arrive at 8:30, a half hour ahead of time.  
We arrive at Antlier’s Campsite for a noon break, and It is no doubt the most beautiful campsite on the trail, situated next to a lake.  Our goal today is to stay at Whitehouse Landing.  The MATC doesn't allow businesses to post signs on the trail, but is marked by another name, the Mahar trail.   Medicine Man and I walked past the sign and went 1.7 miles out of our way before we realized our mistake.  That was also the moment it started raining heavily with rice sized hail.     We turned around and walked back the 1.7 miles through ankle deep water.   
Whitehouse Landing is situated on the opposite shore of a beautiful lake.   The owner has a two way radio at the dock.  A call on the radio prompts the owner, with his 16’ Boston Whaler and outboard motor to come pick us up.   
In the driving rain I call for a pickup.   He says he'll come when the storm passes.   So Medicine Man and myself stand shivering under some pines trying to stay out of the hail waiting for the rain to stop.   
After a half hour, we hear a small boat headed our way.  Carl picks us up and ferrys us to the camp.   Everything is soaked.   We take hot showers and hang wet clothes.   
At 5:00 on, there dining room opens.   I order a half pound cheeseburger and agree to split a 14” cheese pizza with another hiker.

It is so comfortable in the bunkhouse this morning, and my wet clothes from yesterday's hail storm are hanging above the wood stove.  The owner wouldn't give us permission to light the stove to dry our clotheshe heat would drive everyone out.     It is misty and foggy outside, so we go ahead and change into our wet hiking clothes.  
Breakfast is serve promptly at 7:30 at the Whitehouse Landing.  Seven of us are gathered at the table, and owner Willard Ware is the cook.   He serves orange juice, coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon, a muffin, and all-you-can-eat pancakes.  After breakfast Willard takes us, three at a time, by boat back across the lake where we continue hiking.   
Except for Mount Nesuntabunt, there are no great elevation changes all the way to Rainbow Stream Lean-to.  We are getting so close; only 15 more miles tomorrow and we'll be at Abol Bridge on the edge of Baxter State Park.  
I can't believe the end is so near.   I don't know how many times I thought to myself, “I’m not sure I can handle this.  That's too steep.  I'm too old for this.   I just can't handle this”.   I recall standing at the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center looking at the Wildcats Range across the road.  I mentioned to one Hiker I'd been with some time, and he said, “Come on, let's do it together”.   That turned out to be a good day.   One elderly Hiker down in Georgia told me three years ago, “Just go slow and steady, and steady is fast”.   Over the thousands is miles, I've found that to be true.

Hundred Mile Wilderness- Day 7
Medicine Man and I actually get started walking at 5:30.  It is our last day in the 100 mile wilderness and we are excited to be done with it.  The constant roots, rocks, and mud are taking its toll on my legs.  
Mid morning, we come upon a young fellow standing in the trail. He is wearing waders and us holding a fly fishing rod and a canoe paddle.   He asked us if we know where Donut Pond is.   We told him we saw the sign a half mile back, which said the Pond was 1.4 miles.   We thought it humorous to find someone dressed like that on the trail.   Apparently there are fishing camps located nearby.   
We exited the Hundred Mile Wilderness onto Golden Road about 12:30.  Our first concern was ice cream.  When we get to the Abol Bridge store, I order a Maine Black Bear, which is vanilla ice cream with black raspberry swirls and chocolate bits.  I go inside and inquire about a camp site.  We get the last one remaining.  The lady behind the counter tries to take my information but I am focused on my ice cream.  She smiles and says, “here, I'll write and you just tell me”.
Medicine Man and I have questions about the entrance process to Baxter Park.  The signup board opens at 6:00 am, and only the first 12 hikers are allowed in for the day.   We are worried that if we stay for the free breakfast at 7:30, we may not make the 12 that day.   
We are sitting in the Abol Restaurant when a park ranger comes in and talks with a group of hikers, clarifying the process.  He leaves but later comes back in the restaurant, comes over to Medicine Man and me and offers a lean-to at the Katahdin Stream Campground.   Usually booked up for months in advance, someone just canceled, and he offered it to us.   We were flabbergasted.  This is truly Trail magic at its finest.   Now we can stay at Abol for breakfast and leave at our leisure.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

We stop at the ranger’s station, write down our names on the registration list, but there is no one there.  After setting up our tents, we go back to the ranger’s cabin; still no one.  We try one last time at 5:30 pm, still no ranger.  We believe we've done all we can do.   We still need to pay for our site and our climbing permits, which we have yet to attain.

It's done.  It's over.  Accomplished.  Medicine Man and I emptied our packs and put all our belongings in our pack liners, and took them to the ranger’s station for safe keeping.   We carried only our snacks water, and rain wear.  
We started up the Hunt trail at 6:00 am.  The sky looks clear and sunny, but extremely windy.  When we get to tree line, the wind became ferocious and cold.   I put on my gloves, rain pants and jacket for warmth.  The climb is the most difficult we've experienced on the entire trail.  We pull ourselves up shear rock face by grabbing rebar set into stone.  
We finally reach The Tablelands but still two miles from the summit.  The sense of excitement builds as we spot the sign and a few people already around it.   
I am overwhelmed as I grab the wood Katahdin sign, and the entirety of the last four years passes through my mind.   There is tremendous ambivalent feelings, even tears to think that it's all over, yet overjoyed that I've stuck with this task that I almost quit many times.   This was the most difficult thing I've done in my entire life.   I shall rejoice in it always.","Katahdin Stream Campground
