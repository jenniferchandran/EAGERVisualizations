Lucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556082,"Well tonight is the night before I fly out. I could not be more excited or more nervous. I think my animals recognize this as the curl up extra close before I head out. After all this time of counting every ounce, and triple checking myself at every step, I have realized that I am about 10 pounds over weight. I have no clue where this came from. Thankfully my first three weeks are pretty mellow and I plan on finding the cause of my problem and shedding that as soon as possible. For me this is more of a Hello World post, but I will also add the link to my gear and itinerary for anyone interested.

Lucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556152,"So the bags are packed, gear is set, and I am in Georgia waiting and ready to attack this monster. Today was a long day only in the fact that I did not sleep much last night. But now that I am here and I finally have fuel, I am ready to go and can sleep easy tonight. I am blessed that my brother-in-law's family (my step-in-law's?) are so awesome. They picked me up from the airport and we did a fun little walk in the woods. Having a last family meal has been awesome and I am hoping that they will be able to join me for more of the trail. I did have a cool moment of serendipity today. I ended up sharing a flight with Abby Stone a girl from my company at the academy. It was amazing to see her and get to catch up. I hope you have an awesome trip Abby!",,The night before,"Mar 11, Sat",0
Lucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556886,"The first week passed in a blur, and with weather so cold I couldn't make my hands wrote I figured that now in the comfort of a hotel I would summarize my first week on the trail for y'all. Day 1- I did the approach trail and man forget those stairs. That was terrible. But I also met Foghat a man who I have so much respect for. He is hiking memory of his son and is one of the most laid back people ever. That night I also met Adaline the badass newbie who planned her trip a week before hitting trails. I also met Papa Smurf, and Smurfette. Jimmy John, and Hodgepodge. And Squirt a man who lost 80lbs on the trail last year and plans on thru-hiking again. Day 2- I hiked with Foghat and Adaline to Gooch Gap shelter. We had snow dumped on us but still had an awesome day. Day-3 bad weather forced many hikers including myself off the mountain. One woman was rescued for severe frostbite. Day- 4 Met with and joined Gypsy and the heartbreakers (Chopstocks, Plodder, Chainsaw, Sally Mae, Sun Green, Pack Horse, and Funky Moon). We spent another night off the mountain. That night a backpacker shattered his shoulder and another one blew off his hand. Day 5- TRAIL MAGIC!!!! King Tut was a saving grace and I could not have been happier to have had the privilege to meet him. Day 6- BBQ trail magic. Gypsy, Plodder, and I break from the group to allow injuries to heal. And met the infamous Miss Janet. Day 7- Gypsy and I took a Zero day and are gearing up to hit the trails again. We will drop back to some single digit days to allow us to heal up and hit the trail stronger. I love y'all for reading. And this whole trip has been so incredible. I have never been surrounded by such beauty in such a high concentration as I am here on the trail.","

Lucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556974,"Day 8- Woohoo a week already. A bad weather and injury filled week. But a week nonetheless. For the next few days I'll be taking it light so I figured I would talk about some lessons learned. So I'll start with gear I've brought so far that I wish I hadn't. -Solar Panels. Would be much better in the middle states but here in the woods and winter it's not much use. -My tent. It would have been much better to just bring my hammock from day 1. Gear I didn't bring but am glad I have now. -Knee brace. Accidents happen, injuries happen. And being able to take care of yourself is vital. Thank you mom and dad for the monster brace my knee feels brand new again. -Handkerchief. Seriously weighs nothing and makes it so easy to clean out gear. Cool gear I might want later. -Little handheld radio. Very useful for getting local weather reports. I also met three SOBO hikers coming in for their finish. It was awesome talking to them and listening to their experiences. I'll keep doing gear and food review tomorrow. I love y'all.","

Lucky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557812,"So I am switching to a new format of writting about the current mile I'm at instead of trail day. Because I am forgetting the days hardcore. So big news update I broke into triple digits. And feel like a hero. I am still working on getting ""trail hard"" which is supposed to be awesome. I have met some amazing people including my two personal trail angels Wren and Charity. I am sad to see Flsh head back to teach. But I know she will pass me when she gets back to the trail. I finally got updates about papa smurf and smurfette so I'm quite pleased with that. I spent a few nights at gooder Grove Hostel and it was the best place o have ever stayed. Franklin NC is overwhelmingly nice. And everyone there takes it as a personal challenge to make their town the most hiker friendly town they can. My bad knee is starting to get stronger. And I love the trail so much. I'm about a day from the NOC and three from Fontana Dam. In other news I'm thinking about writting a book called ""I poop in the woods and so can you"" I figure so many of the adults out here are beyond helping with their bad waste management but maybe if we start them young future hikers will no longer have to fear the dreaded white mine fields.","
