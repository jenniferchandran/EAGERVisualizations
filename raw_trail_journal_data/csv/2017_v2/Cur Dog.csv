Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555124,"Hi folks. Welcome to the trail journal for my AT hike. Getting ready to go...starting March 8th at the Archway. A list of some of my equipment (at least starting out).Pack: REI UL 60Bag: Marmot Plasma 15Boots: Merrell RidgepassPad: NEMO Tensor 25LStove: Pocket RocketTent: Big Agnes Fly Creek 1I will eventually change my bag to a Mt. Hard Wear Phantom 32 then a Phantom 45, then back to a Phantom 32 in New England. I have used the Big Agnes Fly Creek 1 on one trip, but like my side entrance MSR Hubba. I'm going to start with the Fly Creek to see how it goes since I can save a bit of weight.",,Home,"Feb 25, Sat",0
Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555271,"Since I live in the low country of South Carolina, I usually jog about 3 times a week to get my heart rate up to simulate elevation and hills.   Now that I am retired, I also have been going on 4 hour walks with my full pack including water and food.   I alternate jogging days and the walking days.I have access to a 4000 acre wooded area that is crisscrossed with dirt roads and fire breaks. My hope is these 4 hour walks will smooth out the transition as I start the AT. Time will tell!",,Home,"Feb 26, Sun",0
Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555316,"I truly appreciate the ultralight direction equipment has taken especially when I remember the equipment I have used the past 45 years as a hiker. I admire the folks that get their base weight in the 10 pound region. I have benefited from this as well, but my base weight is closer to 20 pounds. However there are a few luxury items I plan to take on my hiking vacation.   I plan to use my Galaxy S6 for camera, GPS, etc and will bring an Anker Astro E1 as a backup charger.   I do plan to keep my phone in airplane mode most of the time and hope to get 3 to 4 days between charges, so we'll see if I keep the backup.   I will also bring a flash drive to backup the photos from the phone.The rest of my luxuries primarily have to do with sleeping.   In my youth, I could easily fall asleep on my closed cell foam pad. When I hit 40, I had a difficult time getting comfortable on it, so switched to a self inflatable.   With the self inflatable I thought it could not get better! Well, when I hit 50, I found out that logic was was incorrect and moved to an inflatable.   Not only that, but I use the full big boy size to cover my height.   For a pillow, I use to use clothes, boots, etc, but now use a Sea-to-Summit Aeros. Finally I will bring mt Kindle paperwhite. I find that reading is the great way to put me to sleep once I crawl into my bag. The paperwhite is nice since the battery life is good and you do not need external light to read. If I find I don't use it that often, I will ship it back home to save the 1/2 pound.",,Home,"Feb 27, Mon",0
Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555406,"One week to go. Today I drove to Fort Mill, SC to visit my brother and to deliver some gear that he and his daughter will use for a trip later this month. While there,, I took the opportunity to take my pack by the REI Pineville store to make sure all the adjustments were made. Thanks to Rob with REI for taking the time to load my old UL60 up with some weight and fine tuning and adjusting.",,Home,"Mar 01, Wed",0
Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555501,"Finished another 4 hour prep walk today. We finally had a chilly morning to prepare me for the cooler days in the mountains. After my walk I went by my old work area to eat lunch with my former colleagues.
Being retired from a ""Monday to Friday Job"" has changed my outlook on the days of the week...really no surprise there. I haven't lost track of what day it is, but Fridays are now like any other day...and that is a good thing!",,Home,"Mar 02, Thu",0
Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555705,"Today I finished my last training walk. My support team/wife and I leave tomorrow for the state park lodge so I can start at the archway on Wednesday. While walking, I clearly remembered my first ""backpacking"" trip. I was a 13 year old Boy Scout with Troop 48 in Fountain Inn, S.C. A couple of times a year we would car camp at a local pasture about 5 miles from our Scout Hut. On one trip, a group of us decided we wanted to pack our personal items, sleeping bag, etc into our packs and walk the 5 miles. It was a challenge with my old canvas Yucca Pack (sans hip belt), but I was hooked! From there, bigger trips were planned and money from after school jobs went to better equipment: an external Camp Trails pack, a down sleeping bag (from Sears!!), an Optimus 99 stove, a Gerry rain parka and so forth. As I start this journey, I hope part of my teenage self still resides deep in my soul. As my legs burn going uphill and as a cold rain trickles down my back sending chills to my core, I need that teenager to remind me to bear down and not quit. For around the next bend in the trail, there are others waiting to teach me new skills and to share life experiences.",,Home,"Mar 06, Mon",0

Weak signal here so will not add a lot of details....but weather was fantastic.Updated 3/9. Have a better signal so updating this entry. After my wife dropped me off, I went up the trail a bit so I could watch her drive home. It was sad, but I know I will see her soon.Once I got about a mile off Springer (at the parking lot), the trail was like a highway and I made good time. There were about 15 tents at Hawk Mtn camp...and I think all of us were in our tents by 8:00 pm.","Archway

A big group here at Woody Gap. We took full advantage of the picnic tables and we all cooked dinner there. My table was Superfly, Sunshine and Nature Boy. I am sharing a campsite with Bucky from Burlington, NC.   He first did a thru hike in 2002 when he retired at 65. He told himself then that he would do it again when he was 80. Well, it is 15 years later and he is 80 and still going. What an inspiration!

Before heading out, Superfly, Aslan, Bivy and myself decided to split a Blood Mtn cabin at Neel, so called to make a reservation.   It will nice to have a place to dry out equipment. Made good time to Jarrard Gap, small up and downs mixed with level walking. The hike up Blood Mtn was slow, but not too bad. The view on the top was great since the weather changed from overcast to sunny. Going down Blood Mtn was tricky due to the grade and slippery rocks.Picked up supplies from Mountain Crossings.   Headed to the cabin where the pizza and shower were great","Woody Gap

At Hogpen Gap, Bobby from Blairsville was set up for some trail magic. I had some home made oup, strawberry short cake and candy. The clouds started coming in during the afternoon and the temperature dropped. I was able to get a spot in the shelter, sharing it with Wild Thing, Rockhopper, Mandrake, Red, Lung Cookie and Alex. Wild Thing and Alex are both from the UK. I will write more about Wild Thing at a later date. I also spoke with Speckled Hen and her husband G2. A big crowd at Low Gap with about 15 tents.

I was glad I had my neck gaiter since it was a bit nippy. Saw Speckled Hen and G2 on the way out.At Unicoi Gap I had my second straight day of trail magic. Rainman and his family provided a bit of Southern Hospitality via the Motor City. They provided burgers, dogs, brats and all sorts of goodys.Got to Tray Mtn shelter and got a spot.

Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556319,"Cold last night. I finally have worn every piece of clothing now since I put on my base layer bottoms. Because of daylight savings, started walking when it was a tad dark. I put my water bladder under my pillow, it didn't freeze and cleared my hydration hose last night. While walking my hose would still flash freeze before getting a good flow, so basically useless. Would have to stop to drink directly from the bladder, but even that eventually turned to ice.Wild Thing, Blue Bandana and I were criss-crossing all the way to the gap where we caught the motel shuttle to Hiawassee. Before that I went down to Top of Georgia to check it out and get my passport stamped. Looked like a nice set up, but the staff guy helping me said they were already booked for March.I plan to stay in Hiawassee until Thursday when the weather warms a bit. I am glad I decided to bring my 15 degree bag. I want to enjoy this trip and I have camped enough in single digit weather to know it is not the most pleasant experience especially if you are wet with sweat (and from South Carolina).I met Wild Thing and Shutterbug for dinner when Rocket, Stockings and another couple also arrived. We had a nice chat about possible hikes im Colorado.","Tray Mtn Shelter

Ran into Speckled Hen and G2 again; they are always so positive and cheerful. They are also planning to start back Thursday. Thought I would use this entry to update some of the folks I have been hiking with. Superfly and Aslan from Neel Gap hitched a ride to Helen and got a room. They texted me later and said they had room on the floor, but I was already at Tray Mtn shelter. Superfly's friend Sunshine was only doing a section since he had to head back to work so he headed home at Woody Gap. Bivy is doing a Section until he starts a new job in May. He was going to head home (Atlanta) from Neel to take care of some things before starting back. Bivy is a Physician's Assistant who will start work in NYC. I would like to go into NYC when I am on that part of the trail so we exchanged numbers with plans to meet. All of these young folks were fun to be around. The next generation of Hikers will be great leaders.I hiked with Wild Thing and Blue Bandana the last few days. Wild Thing was heading back out today since he needs to be at Rock Gap shelter on Friday to meet a school group from Franklin. More on what Wild Thing is doing on tomorrow's post.","Dicks Creek Gap

He has set up a program to link 6 schools in the UK to 6 schools in the USA to create a journal of his journey. He has an Instagram account schools_to_school and a YouTube channel. If you search ""Lawrence Wild"" on YouTube you will find his channel. If you watch his part 1 video, he explains what he is trying to accomplish.   Share his video on your social media accounts if possible and maybe other schools up the trail can contact him. As an example, on Friday he will meet students from Franklin at Rock Gap shelter to study the effect the wildfires had on water quality. They will then write reports on their experience.","Hiawassee

There was a crowd gathered at the Ga-NC border sign since it was a great photo op. Couthouse Bald was steep and tough. The weather was nice until Bly Gap then the cold wind hit and thete was still a lot of snow on the ground. Many campers were at the shelter, but most if us opted for tents since we expected a cold night.   The shelter was nice with a ""covered patio"" and a table so we all cooked there.

I know there will be a time when I'll want some cool temperatures, but it is difficult for me t get going on cold mornings. There was a lot of ice on the trail and I really needed to watch my footing. It reminded me of black ice on the road. The trail up and down Standing Indian is nice, but tricky in some places due to ice.After Carter Gap, the ice was gone, but then there was mud that wa just as slick. The sun finally came out, got to camp and set up tent. Several other hikers here and I think most of us are heading to Franklin tomorrow.","Muskrat Shelter

I was glad to heading to a motel in Franklin so I could dry it out.The trail to the Gap was very nice with a good grade. Hiked a while with Penn St, the Oklahoma girls and Alex from tbe UK who now has the trail name of Salty. Was able to get a ride into Franklin then checked into the motel followed by laundry and shower. Ate a big late lunch of a burger with rings which would do me for the night.

I will also need to come off the trail for 2 weeks in May.I have updated some of my equipment.   First, I have changed to my side entry tent since it is easier to slide my old legs into and it will be nicer for rainy weather.   I also have switched to my 32 degree bag even though more cold weather is expected. I have used this bag in true 32 degree weather before and it is comfortable at that temperature. I also am leaving my Kindle at home.

Arrived at the shelter where Wip and Giggles were already there. There was room in the shelter, so decided to stay there to keep the tent dry. Zebra later came up and also stayed in the shelter.

View on Cheoah bald was great.Two time Thru Hiker Hopeful and his wife Diana were doing trail magic at Stecoah Gap. They had hot dogs, beans, potato salad, slaw, Little Debbies and sodas. Since it was after 5 pm, decided that would be my supper for the day.Jacobs Ladder was tough, but Hopeful's trail magic gave me the energy to get over it.Shelter was full so set up my tent. Very glad that I switched over to my side entry. It is worth the extra weight.Met Krazy Korean at shelter.

After all the cold and snow, I will not complain about that (at least for now).Met Bubba and we made the quick trip down for lunch. We used the By-Pass to go into Pigeon Forge since Gatlinburg was a zoo. Had BBQ for lunch and I think my hiker hunger is starting to kick in since I cleaned my plate quickly. Bubba took me back to the trail and headed to Icewater Spring shelter late, but there was still plenty of daylight. Once again the shelter and camping areas were packed with thru hikers.

I noticed she had a Philmont patch on her pack so we discussed that. Then she noticed I had a Clemson cup and she noted she is an Auburn grad.

Data is a thru hiker and is taking a leave from the REI Flagship store in Seattle to do his hike.

Was up and out about 7:30 am so I could get a hotel room in Hot Springs. Decided I would take a zero on Monday to take care of my sleeping pad situation, resupply, etc. Last night I had to blow more air into my pad twice, so not too bad. I was not able to find the leak with ""feel"" and did not want to wet it down out in the field, so hoping to get a bathtub to find the leak.Easy walking to start the day. Passed B.R. along the way. Small climb to Walnut Mtn Shelter, then a bigger climb up Bluff Mtn. However, with the knowledge I was heading into town, I was motivated to stay positive.The previous day I had 2 trail magic opportunities. The 2nd one was 2016 thru hiker Blue Sky and his family (pictured). Turns out the are also from South Carolina, Tega Cay to be specific. My brother also lives there so they may follow up.After Bluff Mtn, ran into thru hiker Singalong (Sing-a-long) who was taking a zero. Her daughter and son-in-law were also doing trail magic at Garenflo Gap. Had a sandwich, pretzels, fruit and a soda. It was good timing since I was ready for lunch. That magic gave me the energy to knock out the last 6.6 miles to Hot Springs.Got to town and was able to get a motel room for 2 nights. However the bathroom had a walk-in shower, not a tub! I was hoping for a tub to find the leak in my pad.

Walked the mile to Cantarroso Farm and was greeted by Mike. He said he could have picked me up, but the road walk was not bad. Mike gave me the tour and I was really impressed. This is a great place to stay if you remember the first season of SNL. I met his wife Peggy (Queen Bee) and together they are wonderful hosts and it is a scenic location right on the river. Mike set me up with some loaner town clothes while mine were being washed.   After a shower. Mike drove me to town where I had lunch at the Hawg 'n Dawg.

The thick forest actually cut down on the rain and wind.Saw very few hikers on the morning, but did see Squeaks, Gray Eagle and B.R. who were all heading to the next hostel for shelter from the rain. B.R. was surprised to see me going southbound and said ""What the #&@% are doing southbound?"" I explained I wimped out for the day when he admitted he was heading for the hostel which is unusual for him.After a quick lunch, started back and ran into many more hikers.

Got to Dragons Tooth and did the photo ops and ate lunch.  Diciple is here as well.  Climb down is extremely challenging due to steep rock drops; there were a couple of places where steel rod foot/hand holds are in the stone.  
Got to the road and Diciple and I walked the short distance to 4 pines hostel.  There was a good group at the hostel, many hikers I have met before.  Joe and Donna (owners) are very nice and accomodating.  
Took a shower and had some clothes washed,  then Diciple and I took the shuttle to Catawba Grocery.  Did a small resupply and had a burger with fries...plus took a pint of ice cream back to hostel.  Life is good.","Mile 690.7, Audie Murphy Memorial

Got to VA 311 about 10 am and started towards McAfee Knob.  There were many day hikers going the same direction,  but that was expected.  Arrived at the top and had someone take the traditional photo.  Ate lunch, then headed to Tinker Cliffs.  
Looked like a storm was coming in,  but had some wind and a tad of rain,  then cleared up.  Along the way, my right pinky toe was really bothering me since it was banged up from the day before.  At the cliffs, the weather was now perfect and the views were outstanding.
Headed to Lamberts Meadow to camp and met Hot Sauce and Ziplock, 2 fellow South Carolinians and Clemson graduates.  Set up tent and Diciple, Swiss Miss and Hook did the same.  Swiss Miss and Hook are Army veterans taking part in the Warrior Expeditions/Warrior Hike.  It started to rain, so we all headed to our respective tents.","VA 624, Newport Road

Got to Hanover about 7:30 am and said our goodbyes to Rob.  Before hiking, we went by Lou's for our free thru hiker doughnut.   It was great.  Short, but challenging climb once we left Hanover then rolling ups and downs until the base of Moose Mountain. I had lunch at Mink brook then started the climb.  There were some steep sections at the beginning,  but gradual uphill as you approached the south peak.  The view from there was OK since it was fairly clear.  
Headed over the north peak (no view) then started the decent which was steep with roots in some areas.   The climb up Holt's Ledges seemed to go on forever,  but finally got there.   Views were OK.  Arrived at shelter about 5 pm.  Large group here including Van Man and his son, Jax Dad and  Brave Heart.","Hanover, NH

Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575864,"Nice walk to the base of Smarts Mountain then started the climb.  Trail was not bad, some steep sections,  but overall a nice grade.  I do prefer doing these climbs in the morning.
No view on top unless you climb the tower....which I did not due to my fear of heights.   Folks who did go up the tower said the view was great.  From the summit, headed down where I ate a late lunch at South Jacobs Brook.
Climb up Cube Mountain was another one of those afternoon climbs that seem to take forever.  There were good views here,  I did not have to climb a tower!  Did get to see the partial eclipse since Van Man had a pair of eclipse glasses he had given Disciple. 
Stocked up on water after the decent and got to camp about 6:30 pm at a steath site near NH25A.","Trapper John Shelter

Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575937,"Had a big breakfast at the hostel, called the best $5.00 breakfast on the trail.  Doing a SoBo slackpack of Moosilauke today, starting at Kinsman Notch and hiking back to the hostel. Very steep trail to begin out of the notch following the creek/waterfall.  The climb was not too bad since there were steps and hand rails that really helped.  Past the Beaver Brook Shelter, the climb became ""normal"" with some ridge walking and reasonable climbs.  Saw Giggles and Many Miles on their decent who I last saw in Connecticut. As soon as I broke treeline the cold wind was strong.  On the summit, the rain jacket came on to break the wind.  There were some clouds around the summit, but they would clear occasionally for some nice views.  I met Minnie and her husband Kona on top.  Minnie recognized my name since she reads trailjournals.com. The decent was challenging in places because of the slippery roots and rocks.  Additionally,  my left foot is a bit sore after twisting it yesterday.  Back to the hostel got a shower, then to town for another burger with fries.  Much cooler temperatures today so hopefully good sleeping weather.","Glencliff, NH

Cur Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576131,"Today was my welcome to The Whites moment. Another good breakfast at Hikers Welcome hostel, then caught the first shuttle to Kinsman Notch.  Going NoBo today with full pack.  Steep climb out of the notch, then rolling up and downs to the base of Wolf Mountain. Several steep climbs up Wolf which made for slow going,  but the decent really was slow.  My left foot is still sore, so I was very careful not to twist it on the decent.The climb up Kinsman was very, very challenging; by far the toughest climb I have had on the AT (to date).   I have had steep rock scrambles before, but none that were as long as this.  They say the trail trains you for what is ahead, and I believe that!  There is no doubt the previous shorter rock climbing helped.  There were great views from the south summit so I stopped to ""smell the roses"" and let it all sink in.  I moved on to the North summit with another view, then down to the shelter.  I met the caretaker and got a tent platform.  It took me a solid day to do this section, but I expected shorter miles in The Whites.   Got very cold while preparing supper, so quickly got my food to the bear box after I ate.  Out of my damp clothing and socks, then put I my newly arrived base layer and crawled into my newly arrived 32 degree bag.  I am warm and toasty.  Living the dream.","Kinsman Notch

Garfield which was a tough climb.  It was steep and the end of the day so I was really tested.  View on top was spectacular of the Franconia Ridge.   Got to camp early, so early to bed tonight.","Franconia Notch

Steep climb up South Twin, but views were great on top.  The decent from there was not as bad as Garfield,  but still hard on the knees.  Got to Zealand Falls Hut and had a bowl of soup.  
The Ethan Pond trail was not bad, the first half was very nice.  The second half was mostly flat, but had rocks, roots and mud.  Got to camp and set up tent on a platform.  Good day on the trail.","Garfield Ridge Shelter

Level section to start the day, then a nice decent into Crawford Notch.  Filled up with water at a spring, then started the climb up Webster.  The trail to Webster Cliffs was steep, but manageable.   The climb up Webster Mountain was a different story.   The hand over hand climbing was back,  but nothing close to Kinsman.  Great views from here and later on Jackson.
Got to Mizpah Springs hut and had some bread.  Decided to tent rather than do work for stay.  Since it was a short day, had dinner early and was in sleeping bag by 7 pm.  Cool temperatures tonight!","Ethan Pond

Hung around and ate breakfast at Mispah before I left.  To ""pay"" for breakfast, I swept out the bunkrooms.  Started hiking about 10 am.  Took my time and enjoyed the views along the way.  It was overcast, but a high ceiling, so views were good.  A bit windy and cold, so found a wind break to eat lunch.  Got to Lake of the Clouds about 2 pm and had a bowl of soup.  Had a good signal, so was able to update my trailjournals.com blog.  Later, asked and got a WFS,  but it turned out that all hikers who wanted WFS got it.  Staff there was really nice.
Did the nature walk with the naturalist,  then waited until the guests finished eating, then we ate with the Croo.  Our chore was polishing some of the pots and pans with steel wool.  After lights out, the hikers set up for the night in the dining room.  Sleeping warm tonight.","Nauman Campsite

Washington a little after 7 am.  The trail up was not bad and got to summit around 8 am.  Weather was very calm with little or no wind.  There were only hikers at the summit.  Stayed on summit about 2.5 hours and had a 2nd breakfast and early lunch.Continued hiking, weather remained great with partly cloudy sky.  Trail to Madison Spring Hut not bad, trail down Madison tough steep downhill going through a thick Balsalm Fir growth.  Got to camp about 6:15 pm.","Lake of the Clouds
