Blue Bandana/Minnie Mouse ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554897,"I have been involved with National Association for Mental Illness Hunterdon for the past 3 years. NAMI’s goals are to raise awareness for mental illness and to assist those who are diagnosed with one or many mental health disorders. NAMI is responsible for many public awareness events and activities for mental illness in Hunterdon County New Jersey. NAMI strives to lessen the stigma that comes with mental illness through the education of families and communities of those who are diagnosed with mental health disorders. It has certainly changed the way I see mental illness, and it has made me a better person because of it. As you know, I will be hiking the Appalachian Trail soon and was thinking of a way to give back to this awesome organization that has provided support for me and my family. Although the act of hiking is individualistic and often solitary, the larger hiking community on and off the trail is made of people helping other people. That being said – I am using my hike as an opportunity to raise awareness for a good cause, and, selfishly, to keep me accountable to get to the end. In my absence I hope to still give support to this organization through your donations. To donate please visit the NAMI Hunterdon website at. www.namihunterdon.org

Next I knew I was face planted on the trail with blood pouring from my nose. The first thing that came to my mind was that I broke my nose and then I checked for loose teeth.

Sketchy is a veterinarian and Veg does some type of research with salmon. She has a better term for it. 
 Sketchy said the Appalachian Trail is harder as far as the elevation changes but the PCT and CDT are challenging due to lack of support  on the trail. She also said  it can be difficult to hike with a partner -  that is why they are not hiking together this time. I can only imagine .","

Blue Bandana/Minnie Mouse ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573594,I have not written lately because I have not had cell service. I am currently at the Lake in The Clouds Hut - a Hut 2 miles below Mount Washington. I am doing a work for stay tonight which means I will clean up after guests tonight in exchange for a free meal and a warm place to sleep on the dining room floor. The Hut sleeps around 90 guests at the cost of $120 per person. Sleeping for is a privilege extended to thru hikers by the Appalachian mountains club. The Hut also acts as a reprieve for hikers from bad weather.the weather has been cooperating and I have enjoyed walking on the ridges with views of mountains as far as the I can see. The terrain has been challenging but I have reset my barometer in order to be happy with fewer hiked miles. Tomorrow is up and over Mount Washington,"

I used various approaches from going down backwards, sideways, and (the obvious)on my butt. Let's hope I do not wear out the backside of my pants. 
I slept in the Imp Shelter last night in order to get an early start to town. This was the first time I have slept in a shelter since the Smokies. I would rather sleep in my tent but I got to the campsite late and was very tired.Rain that was expected at 11 AM never arrived. It is so hard to plan around the weather because it is constantly changing.
 It is supposed to rain tomorrow. I'm trying to decide whether I should stay at the hostel another day or just push on. Decisions. Decisions.","

A day of non abuse is sure to help.  I have pain in my right knee going downhill but I am mindful to take my time-which helps. This part of the trail is designed for tall people!  The step ups and downs sometimes take more effort with shorter legs.The Hostel is almost as nice as the Notch Hostel- clean, room for privacy, friendly staff who are former thru hikers. I have met up with hikers I know here- sassafras, Bunyon, rocket man, gray mountaineer, Kentucky straight and Ravioli.  You guessed it all guys- this must be how women feel in Alaska. I also met one gallon who is a triple triple crowner which means he has hiked the pacific crest trail, Appalachian trail and continental divide trail each three times. He does not use poles and his pack is basically a sack in his back with thin straps and a small waist belt.        He just stopped by the hostel to  meet rabbit who was getting off the trail to attend  a wedding.","

I crawled under, slid down and climbed down very large wet boulders in Mahoosuc Notch. The boulders were freezing cold to the touch and some even had snow underneath them. I went through the Notch with Bunyon, OutSourced and Velveeta- these guys were very helpful since many sections were not made for short people.  After a mile through the Notch I proceeded to climb the Mahoosuc Arm which is a granite slab up a mountain. This was Bunyon's third time through the Notch- he said he saw a frozen moose carcass the last time through the Notch. Why would anyone want to do this again? It can be fun for some people. Usually they are 6 feet tall.
 It poured rain almost all day.  Bunyon and I showed up at the Speck Pond Shelter soaked and chilled to the bone. Fortunately Firball moved over to make room for us. I had met Fireball at the Welcome Hiker Hostel before the start of the White Mountains.
I did not take any pictures in the Notch due to the weather.  The weather broke during the nightand changed to freezing winds. Is it August?  Or December? So glad to have my zero degree sleeping bag.","

I left the Speck Pond Shelter in reasonably good spirits but that was short-lived as I climbed Speck Mountain. The wind and cold rain became worse as I gained elevation. The summit was my usual sleet and wind knocking me over experience.  While descending the mountain I passed a southbounder who mentioned that Honey and Bear at The Cabin Hostel pick up hikers at the next trailhead.  Needless to say, the minute I got cell reception I called for a pickup. Made my day- the promise of dry clothes, a shower and warm bed perked me up. I am very thankful that my time in the White Mountains of New Hampshire was more pleasant.  It has not rained everyday on the Appalachian Trail but it has been a very wet year. 
I met Honey and Bear the first week I was on the trail. They even remembered me! I was the girl stuffing her face with Little Debbie oatmeal cakes. Haha. They don't remember that but I did enjoy the oatmeal cakes at the trail magic they were at in Georgia.  Such a long time ago....","

I had another night of home cooked food,  a pillow( actually two) and a shower. I am living the life!
Honey and Bear (85 years young)own the hostel and have helped many of a hiker through the last 20 something years. They assisted Earl Shaffer in his anniversary hike celebrating the 50 year mark of his initial hike. Just for the record- earl shaffer did not like Mahoosuc Notch either. On his initial hike after WWII, the trail in Maine was from lumber camp to lumber camp- not today's trail of  up ridges and down notches. Actually Honey's brother was instrumental in moving the trail. Her brother was a journalist helping to bring awareness about land abuse by the paper companies. Anyway- honey did not dare tell Earl Shaffer when he was complaining about the Notch that she was ""related"" to the cause of the new Maine trail.","

I had one last breakfast of blueberry pancakes at The Cabin before leaving this morning. A thru hiker(Forester) from Indiana has been at the hostel for 2 weeks. She has Lyme Disease and is not responding to the antibiotics. She is doing work for stay with the hope that after finishing this last round of antibiotics she will be able to return to the trail.  I suggested that she slackpack the rest of the trail so it will not be as hard on her body. It is tough if you feel well. Hopefully she feels better soon.
