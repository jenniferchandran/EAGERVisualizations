SeahawkandCheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552964,"Started planning the staging of food to be mailed. Logistics is interesting.Howe fast will we walk? How much will we really eat? How many ""town"" stops will we/should we make? Ok, after 30 days walking we will have the answers. It is kinda like raising kids. When are you qualified to raise a kid---after you raise them",,More Food,"Jan 05, Thu",0
SeahawkandCheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555022,"7 weeks till lift-off and I'm getting nervous. Have been reading Bill Bryson's book, A Walk in the Woods. Funny, well-ridden, but so scary. Got to the part where they're on a 14"" ledge with an 80' drop in a blizzard, struggling to read a crappy trail map. Yikes.   I have a wonderful incentive though. When we get to New York, my family are paying for Seahawk and me to see Hamilton. I am not throwing away my shot. Cheesehead",,Getting nervous,"Feb 22, Wed",0
SeahawkandCheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557874,"We've been dehydrating food like mad for months. Bought a dehydrator and a vacuum sealer as well as silicate packages to put in each sealed meal packet. We tested our food on a recent weekend campout. The campout was a major learning experience since it rained almost the entire time we were there. We decided we needed a different tent (one with two side doors), a different sleeping bag, different rain jackets (ours were not even rain resistant let alone rainproof). But the big success story was our stove (jet boil) and our food. Heated up quickly and was yummy. A rib-sticking combination of brown rice, black beans, lots of veggies, some kind of protein, and some kind of tasty sauce. Yum. We also had wine and tequila so the food may not actually have been as yummy as previously described.Cheesehead","Georgia

SeahawkandCheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558360,"Went on a backpacking hike with backpacking expert Susan (neghbor) to practice campcraft. Learned SO MUCH. Hiked, set up and broke down camp for 2.5 days in pretty constant rain. Learned we need different tent, one with 2 side doors. Learned our expensive Eddie Bauer rain jackets were not waterproof. Luckily, I brought a space blanket (is that what's it's called?) retained for 40 years from my Boy Scout leader days. We suspended it as a tarp over our cooking area which is all that saved us from sitting for hours in our tents eating dry oatmeal and granola bars.We need to get faster and more efficient about setting up and breaking down camp. We need to pack our gear more efficiently. Susan suggested we pack everything into our packs that we plan to take. Then weigh each item individually on a digital scale, then see how we can pare off ounces. She will also send us her spreadsheet that she uses before she goes on a long backpacking trip to tell us what she takes.Our departure date for the AT is April 15, so we have to get smarter and more organized very quickly.Cheesehead","

SeahawkandCheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559523,"We've got 20 re-supply boxes packed and sealed, ready for our wonderful neighbor Susan to mail to us. After trying 6 different shuttle companies, Seahawk finally found us a shuttle driver. Unfortunately, it's the old beggars and choosers thing: we planned to arrive in Atlanta by 10:30 am, shuttle to the trail, and get in 5 miles or so on day one. Not happening. Our shuttle guy can't pick us up until 5:00 pm!! Now we're HOPING to hike 2/10 mile, set up camp, and get an early start on Easter Sunday. Hiking through nature is not a bad way to celebrate that day, or any day.BTW, Seahawk is reading a good book about the trail, AWOL on the Appalachian Trail. Pretty scary, though. The guy who wrote it was plagued by injury. If that happens to us, we're recuperating in Cabo.Cheesehead","

SeahawkandCheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561189,"Spring came early to Texas, but late to Georgia. We walked through fields of rhododendrons that would feature beautiful flowers in another 2 weeks. We did see these wildflowers on Easter and hosted this unexpected visitor in our campsite the next night.","

SeahawkandCheesehead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562517,"I haven't written for a long time cuz this site has been difficult to use. We've been on the trail 2 weeks and have learned a lot. Research paid off. We both love our boots. Seahawk has Oboz and I have Keenes. Both feature special lacing that keeps toes from blistering on downhills. Wearing liner socks and hiking socks and applying moleskin to hot spots before they become blisters has also paid off. Between the 2 of us, we've had 1 hotspot, no blisters. Many of our fellow hikers are suffering with blisters and some infections.We love our water system, a LifeStraw wide mouth bag by which we gather as much as 5 liters at a time. We treat it with 14 drops of Agua Meara (7 from each bottle) per liter. You can hang the bag from a tree and quickly fill backpack bladders and bottles easily. Individual bottles can also be filled using this method. Lots of hikers use the Sawyer System and like it, but we've heard some complaints, and Agua Meara kills viruses.We love our REI quarter dome tent that has 2 doors for easy access and goes up in minutes.We see lots of great cooking systems, some home made. The most convenient seems to be a cooking envelope of some kind. You insert dehydrated food that's inside a plastic bag into the envelope, add boiling water, wait 10 minutes, eat the meal, discard the bag, no mess to clean up. We're cooking for 2. We jet boil 2 cups of water, add it to a pot that contains our dehydrated meal (I made 120 of them), and continue slow cooking the pot for another 10 minutes or so. Then clean up. Very helpful: we watched lots of youtube videos abkut the hike. Most helpful were ones on bear cables, hanging bear bags using PCT method (almost impossible for short people), how much to carry (experts say try to stay as close to 20 lbs as you can). One hiker (trail name Appleseed) carried 55 lbs and no poles, only a big walking stick; another hiker carried 110 lbs. His Marine son advised him. His trail name was Surplus.That's all for now. Attaching photos has proven to be difficult for me. If i can, I'll add one.","Springer Mountain, Georgia
