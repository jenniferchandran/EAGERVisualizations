This was another excellent test of all my equipment listed. It wasn't unusual to run out of water even after I thought I was doing a good job of monitoring. As the day got warm I consumed more water, then couldn't rely on finding flowing water at the next several creeks or springs. One shelter area well was dry. With my Camelback in the pack and not able to visualize water levels, I corrected this by carrying a bottle of water on the outside of the pack, so that when the Camelback was out of water, I still had the last bottle before I was truly out. I also carry chlorine tablets in addition to a filter so that I have a back up system to treat water should I have an equipment failure.

Shillelagh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538006,"Death on the Appalachian Trail 2013:A look at what might contribute to a hikers death...considering Geraldine Largay in Maine...To answer many of my friends asking about this death on the trail, I must first say what a tragic event and to learn about the loss of life from a fellow hiker on the trail that I will soon negotiate myself. As a fellow nurse, and adventurer, I've been puzzled, like many, to learn what happened on the Appalachian Trail and how to prevent it.I've not read the official report that was just released, but here are some thoughts: Because one is conditioned to hike long distance with a heavy pack does not mean that you are prepared to survive in the wilderness. Hiking 2000 miles, and survival, are two independent skill sets! One must be prepared for both.  For many, there is a false sense of security when we leave our home for a walk in the woods. Falls are common, what about a determined bear, a snake bite, running out of water, a sudden storm or snow fall...There's a science to ""distance hiking and nutrition"" and how to capture the highest calorie content while minimizing weight in your pack. You can burn thousands of calories a day, and may not feel like eating while hiking extended miles. Over time you begin to burn muscle mass for energy. This can leave you susceptible to hypothermia or weakness once you're faced with a bad situation. Many are taught to stay put when lost. But how long do you do that if no help comes? We learned here that it took the first few days to sort out the details about what happened and for a full search and rescue to begin. She set up camp, then died there in about 3 weeks. When hiking, everyone needs a map, compass, whistle, mirror, watch, fire source... Not only to carry but to know how to use them before needed! This includes having an idea of where we plan to be hiking every day. Once lost you can determine north/south from a shadow on the ground; and another method will give you north from the hour hand on your watch. Plenty of YouTube video's show how.  Even without a compass you can use dead-reconing to find a general location, direction, or where to move in an emergency. Food on the trail? If it's survival, there's many things to eat out there. Bugs may keep you alive. Many of my friends can identify edible plants on any given hike.The report says she was off the trail about a mile, for the bathroom... In the wilderness this would be about 20 feet off the trail or behind the next tree... I don't understand this distance from the trail by an experienced hiker?I would have a fire so large they'd need to send in smoke jumpers to put it out. GPS or Personal Satellite Beacon? It's an insurance policy if you don't like the cost of this emergency locator. My device reports my location down to about 10 meters. And to stay put when lost, as many are taught? For how long? What will you do when no one comes? Does anyone even know you're lost or missing?Lost and alone, your mind can save you - or it can be your worst enemy. Knowing what to do when needed can fuel your determination and your will to survive when all seems lost.It's despair that will kill you...","

Shillelagh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545023,"Greetings to friends and our Appalachian Trail Class of 2017! Hope everyone is pacing themselves in this summer heat as we commence or continue our train-up and preparation for the AT. My AT start date is now about 200 days out and so I've made this my arbitrary kick off to a serious training regimen. I actually started 6 months ago with regular walks & hikes up to 10 miles several times a week, with and with out gear. This continued with several ""shake-down"" multi-day hikes, a couple leg strains, and I think I've finally refined my gear selection to a near final packing list that I've actually tested in the field! I added a Goal Zero Nomad 7 solar panel I have yet to test. My plan is to slowly increase my miles per week in all weather and trail conditions until my start date. I should be ready by then...My train up has included hikes along small sections of the AT. With my granddaughters visiting from Florida we hiked in Amicalola Falls SP in Georgia and then drove up to Fontana Dam NC and Fontana Village. Of note: as listed in the AT Guide Book by Miller, the Fontana Dam visitors center, right on the AT, has a public bathroom with a shower!! Also nice to know is that Fontana Village hotel/store/post office/ is about 1 mile off the AT from where the AT meets the marina and is worth a nights stay and a great resupply point! Talked with several AT thru hikers while there. Of course it's not all work and no play, as I had the pleasure to spend a great week kayaking with the Delaware River Sojourn!! There along the AT and Delaware Water Gap, at Kittatinny Point visitors center I was able to discuss current AT experiences with thru hikers who stopped there to use the potable water faucet located beside the building(Another nice to know when on the AT). I'm learning to look for these hidden treasures along the trail.PA, or ""rocksylvania"" is a real pain as everyone has reported! Think I'll head back to the Virginia Creeper trail, 34 mi, and maybe hike it in both directions as another shakedown...See you on the trail!","

My AT start date is now under 100 days!As we continue to prep for our 2017 stroll on the AT I recently took a little drive down to Springer Mountain Georgia to stretch my legs up to Neels Gap and back. For access I used Forest Service Road 42 about 1 mile above Springer. Had beautiful fall weather and views! The forest was bone dry, and thus some of our current southern wildfires, especially in western North Carolina. Also great to meet some of those SOBOs finishing the trail, but most of them seemed to be more focused on the finish! Can you blame them!!? Hopefully, the new hiker I met, already known as ""Over Load"", has lightened that 70 pound pack of his...made my back hurt just to look at it. I'll need to stay focused these next few months of winter to continue my practice hikes and conditioning... Maybe I can get back up to Damascus, VA for another trek yet this year?I've also used my travels to play Trail Angel along the AT in Bland, VA, and where the AT crosses I-40 just south of Hartford, TN...can't tell you how much others have already helped me from the trail...it's good to give back!","Springer Mountain Georgia

Shillelagh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553746,"5 weeks out from my NOBO start and I wanted to share my lessons learned or helpful hints to either the new hiker, or offer a few reliable sources that could provide support to the family of a thru hiker.First, just received my loose-leaf 2017 NOBO Guide by David Miller. Saving pack weight by not packing the entire book to start the AT.While I continue my frequent practice hikes, now almost always with a full pack, I have found time to read a few great AT books for inspiration, perspective, or to provide a foundation on expectations.Appalachian Trials, by Zach Davis provides a “psychological and emotional guide to successfully thru-hiking the AT.” If I had to read one book to prep for the long haul on the trail, this is it. It’s easy to find all the lists of the right gear, all the latest gear spec’s, but Davis provides the rest of the story for the new or long distance hiker. Have you thought about the psychological stressors you will experience after walking in the woods for weeks, when the “honeymoon” phase is over, what mistakes were made by others that we can learn from, and the skills that may help the hiker’s family understand the motivation and difficulties faced during this extraordinary challenge?Hear the Challenge – Hike the Appalachian Trail, by Kyle Rohrig. Another thru-hiker, Rohrig takes an in-depth look at all those “other” pertinent considerations that go into planning a long distance hike. Appalachian Hiker - Adventure of a Lifetime, by Edward Garvey, is a dated book, being printed in 1971, but is a fascinating read from its historical perspective of the AT as well as including the author’s journal entries that describe the shelters, terrain and weather encountered. Might need to skip the outdated food and equipment lists, however, it is fun to see how the times have changed in 50 years of hiking.Granma Gatewood’s Walk, by Ben Montgomery, is a great trail history of a 67 year old grandmother’s drive to hike the AT, and at a time before any women had hiked the trail alone. Websites that provide additional or significant information that I found helpful to use during my preparation:WhiteBlaze.net that includes a list of AT resupply locations within 1 mile of the trail, as well as a list of hostels along the AT.Appalachiantrailclarity.com and look at the tab: “AT for Newbies.” This site includes lots of information about the AT, including basics, articles, resupply points, safety, top 10 mishaps of thru-hikers, points of interest you don’t want to miss, etc. Look for Clarity working at Amicalola Falls SP, Georgia.http://www.sophiaknows.com/atdb/      This “AT Database” provides the clear and concise charts for trail data, such as lists of shelters, post offices, waypoints, sections, etc.YouTube videos: “Introduction to the Appalachian Trail by Wanderlust” are a series of videos by thru-hiker “Dixie” that provides exceptional educational videos covering most of the big questions that AT hikers will face.Every day is a gift!

Shillelagh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554057,"Anyone who knows anything about the history of hiking the Appalachian Trail will know the name Grandma Gatewood. At age 67 she became the first woman to thru-hike the AT. She continued to support the hiking community, and to recognize her dedication to trail preservation, the State of Ohio named a trail after her. It's located at her beloved Old Mans Cave, Hocking Hills SP. In my early years I too hiked at Old Mans Cave, and now that I'm about to start my AT thru-hike, and finding myself in Ohio with my pack, I just had to pay homage, and secure another AT preparation hike! This park has multiple unique and beautiful terrain features consisting of waterfalls, rock formations, and crystal clear streams. The trails will also challenge all levels of day-hiking abilities, whether hiking with the family or if you're in training. The landscape and rock formations are the result of 10,000 year old glacier activity that created the unique conditions for the flora and fauna found in the area today.If ever in the area and thinking of a walk, Hocking Hills SP has a visitors center to answer your questions, lots of area camping and cabins, and would be well worth a stop. Grandma Gatewood thought so!","Hocking Hills SP Ohio

He states his excel spreadsheet is outdated but can be used as a guide to plan a hike and look at potential resupply location. I love it since the spreadsheet has already been created with primary trail towns and shelters. As he mentions, if you use this spreadsheet you would need to update it from the current guide book. I sent him an email, from his book web site, and he sent me a copy of his spreadsheet. I have used a copy in making my plans, along with a current copy of THE AT GUIDE. I also see the value in local resupply sources as I hike but wanted to have some camping food on hand, sent from home, that can be mailed to me when resources become scarce. Talking with Mountain House, the makers of the common camping food that's found in most stores, referred me over to beprepared.com for a bulk purchase.Going to beprepared.com I saw several Mountain House hiking food selections that said ""out of stock"". Since I'm hiking soon I called ""beprepared"" and they reported that they have these items, but they make up their package orders as they are ordered. So I placed my order without problem. So if you should use them and see an out of stock sign, just give them a call. They're in Utah.They expect 1 to 1 1/2 weeks to pack and ship.http://beprepared.com/mountain-house-1-month-emergency-pouch-supply-combo.htmlSee you on the trail, soon!","

Got beat up good that day by a full day of relentless cold winds! Down to Neels Gap i took a zero at Blood Mountain Cabins just down the hill from Mountain Crossing. Took me a couple hours to warm up. Also had to get a new sleeping bag at Mountain Crossing. My Marmot Hydrogen rated at about 30 degrees did not work well with 25 to 30 degrees at night. I was also wearing all base layers and used an army poncho liner (nylon blanket). So i picked up a Western Mountaineering Ultralite LZ. Very expensive but I'm staying warm.

I always thought that one needed to have an ""open"" wound for an infection, but I guess not. Funny that I couldn't create this specific injury during any of my practice hikes during this past year. Perhaps it was due to those few additional pounds of gear for the AT, in addition to my normal brisk pace on the trail, and my shoes...?I've also switched out my Salomon boots for my Oboz hiking shoes... Maybe a little more toe space?

Shillelagh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558143,"Medical Emergency on the ATEver wonder about how you'd get off the AT in an emergency? That question was answered as I hiked north in the Smoky Mountains NP and arrived at Silers Bald shelter on the afternoon of 28 March. Several thru hikers were already there when I was asked to assist another hiker in the shelter with severe abdominal pain, shivering, and unable to walk. They knew I was a nurse. The hiker reported that this was the worst pain he had ever experienced, pain level 10/10, and felt that he needed to be evacuated off the trail.About 4:30pm, and using the AWOL AT Guide Book, calls were made to the numbers listed for the GSMNP Rangers. No Answer. I called 911. After telling them we needed a medical evacuation from the AT in the GSMNP - at Silers Bald, they first needed to determine what state and county we were in to figure out their response. I reminded them it was in GSMNP and we needed the Park Rangers. I added that we were on the AT 5 miles south (trail south) from Clingmans Dome. They advised that we were actually 5 miles west (geographically).This was followed by several discussions with the Rangers and relaying updates on the hikers condition and personal history. His family was contacted. Ultimately, the Rangers were waiting for a response from their medical director.At 9 pm the Rangers called to report that 2 EMT Rangers were walking to our location and should arrive in about 5 hours, or 2 am, and a Tennessee National Guard Blackhawk helicopter will arrive in the morning to hoist and evac the patient (no place to land on the bald). The EMT's arrived before 3 and began their assessment and treatments.The Blackhawk arrived at about 9:30 am and was on target about 20 minutes before departing.Analysis:1. Weather - was perfect, clear sky, no wind.2. My Verizon phone had a great signal when most phones didn't work from here.3. After contact with 911 and the Park Rangers, it would be 5 hours before I was advised of the rescue plan. It would be another 5 hours for the EMT's to arrive.4. It would be another 6 hours for the Blackhawk to arrive.5. The patient was symptomatic and in pain for about 17 hours in the shelter before the evacuation.6. Praises to the Tennessee National Guard for their ability to mount and achieve the rescue!7. If a medical air evacuation is not available, the Rangers would mobilize a ""litter team"" to carry the patient off the trail, an arduous and hazardous task under any conditions, and further time delay for the patient.A rescue from the AT can be complicated and in this case, under favorable conditions, may be upwards of 24 hours, and with limited treatment even after medical help arrives...Be Prepared!
I would add that all parties involved in this matter were professionals and worked thru numerous considerations to make this evacuation a success!

However, this week, closer to Franklin, NC, in an area called Panther Valley, (30-some miles from the AT), a bear reportedly shredded a camper’s tent looking for food… The camper was not at home at the time. No injuries! But, let this be a warning of the potential out there!Speaking of bears, it drives me crazy that the hikers who set up the best bear bag rigs, sending their ropes and lines 40 feet up into the trees to secure their food, will then brush their teeth and spit the tooth paste next to their (OUR) campsite… You don’t think bears can’t smell tooth paste???? And the bears don’t come for the tooth paste, or gum, or chapstick, or vitamins, left in your pack or tent, they just learn from careless hikers that where there’s the smell of tooth paste you also have food...! While there’s some sense of security in camping with others, sometimes it’s best to go it alone until the new hikers learn about bear behavior...I’ve been off the trail for about 10 days to try to beat my upper respiratory infection/cough that had the better of me while I was out there.

The emphasis in the pic is that my Black Diamond hiking pole is bent, after I took a fall in the mud while coming off Big Bald Mountain. The pole wedged between a root and rock, and it was the only thing to hold as I was on my way down…. We both lost that round…. Now my pole has a history…Since I rolled my ankle early on the AT, while wearing low top shoes, I’ve used my “sick time” off the trail to switch to Oboz Scapegoat Mid hiking boot (just over the ankle for support), non-waterproof, for quick drying in the warmer weather. They’re comfortable, great insole comes with it, the shoe has a collar to keep the debris out, and all reviews suggest this is an excellent hiking shoe.
