Spiceman and Milkshake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588526,"Day 1 of hiking.  Thanks to Hillary for the ride to our starting point at Waynesboro, Va.  We both enjoyed the views on the trail but we do not have out trail legs yet.  The highlights for the day include Spiceman losing his aquamira.  Thankfully Milkshake has enough for both of us.  A rookie mistake even though he was a past thru hiker.  We passed our intended destination of Calf Mountain Shelter and hiked a bit down the trail near a beautiful stream. The real highlight of the day occurred after dinner.  As we were cleaning up Milkshake spotted a mama bear with a cub walking directly towards us not more than 30 yards away.  So what did we do, whisper to each other, as if she could not see or smell us, and continued to take pictures.  I did think of her and her cub as I was crawling into my sleeping bag.","Waynesboro, Va

Spiceman mentioned to Milkshake that as time goes on we will be able to get out of camp much earlier.  Of course, much of it depends on if you cook breakfast or eat a cold breakfast.  We came across a couple of thru-hikers at 1:15 who said they still had 12miles to go that day.  Heck, we were glad to make 13 miles all day.  We stopped at Lewis Mountain Camp store and spent $20 on junk food.  Day three and already eating junk.  At our campsite we met a group of hikers who were out trying to loose weight.  It was a formal outing with guide, etc.  The idea sounds good but the leader told us several dropped out already and they were also only on day 3.

Giving me the time to hike.  Not all spouses are that supportive.  We stopped at Lewis Mountain Campground for a shower.  We have not been out that long but it sure felt nice.  The logistics of taking a shower while on the trail are always interesting.  Getting quarters, renting a towel, getting the mud off of you and then putting dirty clothes back on.  You hike in the same clothes everyday so they stay dirty.  Since we did not have far to go after leaving the campground, we decided to buy some hotdogs and buns.  We knew it was going to rain so we quickly set up our tents and hoped for the best.  Everything worked out well.  No major problems.","Vic Hightop Hut
