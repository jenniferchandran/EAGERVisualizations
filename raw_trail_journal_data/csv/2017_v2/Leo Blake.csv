Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/426215,Saw a show about hiking the AT on Netflix earlier this year and caught the bug. If all goes well we'll be in a position for me to retire in 2016 and get myself prepared to thru-hike the AT in 2017.Will update this journal every once in a while until then.,,View Entry,"Jul 18, Thu",0
Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/426239,"Been reading ""Average People; Extraordinary People"" by Mark Allen. Seems to be a great account by a fellow Air Force retiree. I'm about half way through, but I've picked up a lot of good info from him.",,View Entry,"Jul 18, Thu",0
Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/426859,"I'm having the hardest time right now being patient for the time to come. I'm obsessed by the idea of hiking the A.T. I'll have to be creative in finding places to do my training/preparation hikes. I haven't yet hiked any part of the A.T. and want to save it all for when I thru-hike it. Looking at several parks in VA and WV that I'll spend a week covering every inch of trail, many of those inches multiple times, completely breaking down camp in the morning just to set up camp in the exact same spot that night.",,View Entry,"Jul 22, Mon",0
Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/427916,"Still a long time until I set out to thru-hike the A.T. but it's never too early to get in good shape. My wife is going hike a few parts of the A.T. with me, and also just likes to get out and walk, so she will be doing a lot of the training and preparation with me.We did a 3.5 mile walk on pavement on Friday at about a 3.5 mph pace and felt great afterward, though one Achilles tendon was sore the next morning.On Sunday we did a 3 mile hike on the hiking trail at the local park at about a 3.1 mph pace. That trail follows the edge of a lake and has some very nice little ups and downs. I could have easily kept going, but we had a lot of things to get done around the house.",,Physical Conditioning,"Jul 30, Tue",0
Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476070,"Everything is on track to be retired (early) by May 2016, at the latest, and able to be prepared for my thru-hike in 2017. Still reading books by thru-hikers, currently reading the second of the Barefoot Sisters' books, and getting something useful from each one.For the last few months I've also been thinking about getting out to do some Trail Magic in 2016. And also joining a local club that maintains a section of the AT and a couple of shelters. The freedom from full-time work I'll have in 2016 will open up a lot of possibilities.I've also resigned myself to the fact that I won't be able to do any good practice hikes without spending at least some time on the AT. I'm strongly considering hiking the Benton MacKaye Trail in late summer, early fall of 2016 for a good shakedown hike.Honestly, just can't wait to hit the trail, make some new friends, and hike from GA to ME.",,View Entry,"Oct 08, Wed",0
Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/490228,"Couldn't keep the financial progress on-track over the winter, but the decision has been made...2017 is my year for the AT, even if we have to use credit cards (which have been paid off for a couple years now) to make it all work.Ordered my pack, an Osprey Atmos 65 AG, a couple of weeks ago and it's sitting here on the couch next to me. Makes it all feel more real. I'll be packing it with some camping gear we already have, and some more new backpacking gear, and going out on some 2 and 3 day weekend trips this summer.Will also be RV camping in Grayson Highlands State Park over Memorial day weekend and will try to provide some trail magic to this years thru-hikers.",,View Entry,"Apr 22, Wed",0
Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496961,"Spent Memorial Day weekend in Grayson Highlands State Park. Hiked a couple of trails in the park on Saturday and hiked part of the way to Mt Rogers on Sunday. We didn't make it to Mt Rogers because we underestimated how much our two large dogs would slow us down and, more importantly, how much water they would need. We emptied their water bottle and then started giving them water out of our 3L Platypus water bladder. By the time we got back to the camper we had barely a sip of water left.On the plus side, I was feeling great on Monday morning and could have easily gone out hiking again that day. My wife wasn't feeling quite so good and said she has no doubt I can complete the trail in 2017. We're also planning on going back out there for a weekend of backpacking into the Mt Rogers area without the dogs. With that in mind we ordered her 50L Osprey Aura AG pack.Met a couple of thru-hikers and a LASHer (Long Ass Section Hiker), but didn't want to break their stride so I didn't hold them up by asking too many questions. Really looking forward to my time on the AT.",,View Entry,"May 26, Tue",0
Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519181,"A little under 14 months until I cross over from the adventure of preparing to the adventure of doing. During this year I'll be finalizing and buying all my gear, and then taking it all out on weekend hikes. I'll be doing updates on the journal and my gear list as I get it all set.I'm looking forward to following this year's class of thru-hikers, just like I've done for the last several years. Good luck to all of you on your adventure this year.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Wed",0
Leo Blake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553193,"I've been slow to get on here and update my journal, but I made the decision several months ago to delay my hike until 2018. I had a change in jobs last spring and want to see the project through to completion late this year.The wife and I also had made the decision to make some changes in our vehicles, and another year of work will put us in the financial position we want to be in for before I leave work.Good luck to all of you following your dream this year, I'll be watching for your updates. I have all my gear ready for my hike and will be following my dream very soon.",,Delaying the hike,"Jan 11, Wed",0
