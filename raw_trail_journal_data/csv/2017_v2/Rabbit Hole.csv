Some basic FAQ's for friends and family stumbling upon this: 
In order of most common question.
1. Will you carry a gun?
No, its heavy and not needed for long distance backpacking.
2. Will you be hunting, how will you get your food?
No, the same way you do. Through grocery stores, fast food, and the occasional questionable gas station food. 
3. Aren't you worried about being mauled by a bear or crazed hillbilly or wildlife in general?
No. Well, maybe a little but statistically the car ride I take to work everyday is more dangerous.

No, the biggest threats to me are lymes disease, noro virus, and hypothermia. wildlife can be an issue but its mostly mice eating through my pack and stealing food. 
4. Why are you hiking alone?
I'm not. While I will be technically solo, thousands of people through hike Northbound every year around when I am leaving in March. I will be around plenty of people and with all likelihood will be grouping up with people who hike similarly to myself. 
5. How much food are you carrying?
Enough to last anywhere from 1-5 days. The east coast is very populated and you're never that isolated until you get wayyy up north. 
6. How much weight are you carrying?
Depends on amount of food but my base weight is 12-15 pounds depending on spring/summer/fall. With food and water the most I'll ever carry is around 30 pounds. 
7. Distance traveled?
My goal is to average 15-20 miles a day with a day off in a hostel or motel every 10 days or so.",,Intro,"Jun 15, Sun",0
Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461827,"This week I have decided that within the next two years I want to hike the Appalachian Trail. I have loved hiking but want to take my relationship ""to the next step"" no pun intended. I have been buying all sorts of AT related books and trying to plan/go on as many weekend hikes as I can in the next two years. My main goal is to condition my feet and lose a little weight before I begin. Starting this weekend I plan to hike about 15 miles north of Harpers Ferry with my girlfriend (who I'm trying to convince to come do the whole AT but I think she may not have the feet for extended hikes). 
After this weekend I'm planning on hiking my favorite trail and my ""origin story"" the Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail. My first hike was in high-school and we did about 30ish miles of the 70 mile LHHT. It's relatively flat with some stunning views and very comfy shelters with good water and firewood. This journal will force me to expose my dirty thoughts of hiking the AT to the public and commit to the insane idea brewing inside of me. I hope any stranger reading this will reach out to me with their experience/advice and or friendship over the coming two years before I embark. My biggest challenge over the next two years will simply be life and financial preparation considering I right now owe about 80k in student loans or roughly 1,000$ a month in debt. I will be aggressively paying down debt, hiking, and rising through the ranks of my company until I have to take leave or resign from my job and become unemployed for roughly 6 months(I hope not). At this stage I am mostly writing this out to organize my own thoughts and objectives but it can't hurt for the hiking community to see. Hopefully my feet and knees and wallet cooperate over the coming seasons. More training entries to come.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520726,"I got back on trail-journals two years later...sorry about that.So here goes the update. (this incoherent rambling is mostly for myself to organize thoughts so if you want to follow me down my rabbit hole please help yourself)I was planning on two years from when I wrote my last entry in 2014, the date has now been adjusted and finalized pending any major setbacks. Mid to late March 2017 is my target start date from Springer roughly 13 months from now. I'll try to break up my thoughts into categories for this entry to help organize for myself and possibly you, whoever you may be. (Who reads prehike journals from someone who isn't leaving for another year.) :PPlanning/logistics:Well, I have begun aggressively saving and figuring out how to maintain my life while I'm gone and jobless. This includes student loans, car payments, bills, rent, credit card debt, and insurance for me/my car. OH, I forget to mention the obvious one.. all my food, gear, and hostel costs while on trail! Between cost of hiking and keeping my debt ship afloat, I estimate I need roughly 10,00 for funding 5 months of potential hiking time. I'm shooting to hike it under 5 hopefully 4-4.5 to trim costs a little while still getting the experience I am seeking.Research:As an analyst professionally I take data and research to an extreme. On this front I feel much better about things than where I was 2 years ago. I also may have got my trail name already. Whenever I am researching or reading or obsessively updating my gear spreadsheet my girlfriend says, ""Uh oh you're in the rabbit hole again."" I like the ring of Rabbit Hole and I may go with it to avoid silly names. Despite being a pre-trail name it is extremely appropriate. I have been for lack of a better word obsessed on reading and understanding as much as humanly possible about the various facets of a thru hike not just on the AT, I think I caught the JMT and or PCT bug as well. I have been reading just about every book involving the AT or PCT I can get my hands on. I discovered a few wonderful pod casts which led me to many many other great resources. Shout out to The Trail Show and Pox and Puss pod cast, they're really entertaining and both offer great leads for improving your philosophy or gear. As for books I've read at least 15-20 so far on the topic but the most entertaining or useful to my own journey in trail education and gear have been (in no particular order);-Thru Hiking will break Your Heart-I Hike-Skywalker- PCT and AT book-AWOLS trail journal book-Walking with Spring-(The aptly named) How to Hike the Appalachian TrailInternets shout out:-Andrew Skurkas site lead me to some great places for researching and the proper mindset to hiking-White Blaze and all of it's glory (White Blaze was especially useful because once you get to a certain point with hiking and understanding via research you can begin to disagree with what advice is being dished out there and improve upon it or disagree with it, that's when you know you may have a shot)My researching and obsessiveness has ebbs and flows. Right now, since I'm approaching the t minus 1 year mark, I'm researching my pants off as this idea of passion and madness becomes a reality. :oThe last 3 months or so I hit fatigue in prepping/researching/caring and was focused on real life stuff. For now I am back until the weather gets better and I can begin doing some more heavy training and hiking.My researching has brought me to a critical decision I must make over the next year. With the current gear I have, I can save roughly a pound by going with my Warbonnet Hammock over my tarptent double rainbow. Now that's a pretty significant difference in hiking style for most people and for me. I currently only have 2 nights logged in my hammock vs dozens and dozens in my tent. I seem to like the hammock but it's still a little alien to me and I know I don't have the system fully ready for a 3 season on trail. I will be putting both systems through some trials this year and make a call around this time next year. Me mentioning saving a pound in shelter system brings me to another point my research has led me to. PACK WEIGHT MATTERS, I have a few hundred miles from weekends and multi-days under my belt and this is fairly obvious to most backpackers. But, it should have a dramitic effect on my health and distance hiked per day. The trail show especially has put me down the path to a light weight philosophy. I am there to hike not to camp so I need to be as minimal as possible. This butts heads with my general be prepared philosophy and I'm slowly finding my own balance. I am not quite ultra light or whatever silly classification is trending right now but I am lighter than I was. This is all that matters. On my first backpacking trip Dicks Sporting goods was my exclusive outfitter and my total pack weight was probably around 45 lbs (this was 2007 well into the ultra light movement. My current WINTER 5 day setup is running around 35lbs with 5 days of food and 3 liters of water.) I'm making great progress. My big four currently run 8.5lbs going with a tarptent, going with a hammock will run me down to 7.5lbs. Most of my lightweight struggle comes from gear I own vs perfect gear. I began my trail equipment shopping rampage about three years ago before I understood the full plethora of options available for pretty much anything made for the outdoors. A perfect example of my struggle is my Jetboil Sol. I bought it three years ago for long distance hiking. I generally like it, other than the original I bought melted on my first overnight with it. Don't leave oatmeal unattended (less than 8 minutes away from stove, Whoops) on full blast, or your jetboil will begin to melt. FYI, REI somehow let me exchange it for a new one. I probably should have had my hikers license revoked on that but nature called and I left it unattended. ANYWHO, my jetboil. I love it now, and it also FAIRLY light weight for a canister stove. After I had owned this wonderful device I got more serious about alcohol stove research and began to have buyers remorse. I could make a fancy feast or a more professionally made one online for a fraction of what I paid for my Sol. However, My Sol which is no longer sold in stores (I think due to it's tendency to melt in certain situations) is a darn light canister system. Fuel not included the pot/stove weighs 9 ounces. Now I could go down to maybe 6 ounces with a good titanium pot and a super fancy alky with wind screen but the cost of my current stove is enough. This is my gear dilemma in a nutshell. I have pretty decent lightweight gear but it isn't gossamer or z packs or whatever. If I went full bore I could cut at least 3 pounds from my pack but at the cost of at least 600 additional dollars which I'd rather use to my trail savings account.Current Big 4 Gear:Phantom 32 - Light but could do betterTarptent Double Rainbow - Light but could do betterThermarest Neo air xlite - Light but could do betterGranite Gear AC 60- Light but could do better.^ in my early stage I did well purchasing and researching these things but I now realize for a bit more dough I could replace all of these and cut pounds. But, I wont. Mostly due to cost but also, my setup is light but could do better. The level of gear research has made me hate gear with a passion. Gear gets me there and hopefully it doesn't hinder my journey. That's the prime directive of gear, everything else is superfluous. But, until the ole money tree hits me with a few bricks of it's fruit I have to settle for my current lightish setup.I'll post a few more times on my gear mostly to workout my sleep system so I don't die in a storm but I'm more or less settled with my big items until after the AT thru attempt.Luxury Items: Bum bum bummmmI have about 2 lbs of weight which I badly want to bring but fret the hassle of carrying it. My nice point and shoot Sony and a case for it and my external battery to run my phone/watch/headlamp/camera. All the cords battery and camera weigh roughly 2 pounds. This bugs me...I decide I will start with these items unless my trail testing this year convinces me otherwise. I can always send them home on trail and go all ihpone airplane mode if needed.Training/Dieting/HikingThe next year will be fairly rough on my normal state of living. On top of budget cuts to save, I am also dieting and plan to hike a lot more. The most important piece of gear you can have is your body. I'm trying to get this old hum dinger into shape ASAP. The dieting is going fairly well, the training and hiking more have begun slowly. I have a 16mile flat walk day hike planned 2 days from now to see how the old body reacts. (my longest day with pack on trail has been 14 miles through moderate and easy terrain.) This 16 miles will be a flat towpath hike on the C&O canal just to check how my feet and knees hold up in optimal conditions. MY KNEES AND FEET SUCK. I have to get some issues worked out with my feet and my knees hurt on stairs right now at work or in the metro...I hope it's from being overweight otherwise I'm in trouble. Both my parents and one grandparent have had various knee surgeries already. This for me as of now appears as the biggest threat to me getting to Maine. The pain comes and goes and sometimes comes lightly on weekend trips but I have no idea what's going to happen going 2200 miles. Hiking Trips Past and Present (my crappy hiking resume)Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail- 2005 High School 60ish miles over 2 trips one ended in total fucking disaster. I'll be happy to tell you the story if we ever meet in person...it's nuts.Weekends and Day Hikes all over VA/MD- Last 2-3 years I've done many trips around SNP/Dolly Sods/Washington Forest. I do usually a 10-20 mile weekend trip whenever I can get away with it.Smokies Winter Hike-One of the most risky and fun and challenging hikes I have been on was with two buddies and very little research into the trail and terrian in January in the Smokies. It was pretty much straight up to 5,500 feet over the first 2 days with light snow and lower temps than expected. I had all my clothes in a 32 degree bag in about 15 degree temps. It was a rough night but I got through and now I know I can survive the cold.LHHT Thru Hike (Coming Soon)- The lady and I are going to do the 70mile LHHT as a thru in 4-6 days. This mostly will serve as my main shakedown this summer before next year.C&O Hike (Coming Soon) 60 miles- This is kinda just for kicks and makes a super convenient hike and a test simply on mileage with no terrain or gain to test the feet and knees. Should be 20MPD from Harpers Ferry to Georgetown back home. This will be fun because we can train to Harpers and walk home along the potomac in a very risk free setting to do some bigger mileage checks.-----------------I'm tired and done rambling. Have mercy on your soul if you just read that.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520902,"I have added a little training during my work day! I work in a 9 story building, so I have begun stair climbing multiple times a day whenever I get water, food, or take a bathroom break. My goal is to get 15-20 flights of climbing in a day since sitting in a chair all day makes me go crazy. Also, bought a few months to a gym since weather is bad and city walking is boring and flat. I might as well be warm this winter while I do it. My primary goal while at the gym is cardio health and strengthening my knees since they are causing me slight pain when going up/down stairs or hills. I'm still hoping it's simply an issue of gaining muscle and losing weight to remedy the pain but we will see. I will be scheduling a doctors soon to have them checked out.""Keep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean."" -JM",,Pre Hike #4,"Feb 06, Sat",0
Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522095,"Training Hike(s) Saturday 27th and Sunday Feb 28thOld Rag Summit in SNP-9 Miles (2k gain, 3300ft summit with intense scrambling in parts)Great Falls to Georgetown-14 Miles of flatI finally got to do some hiking since the weather was nice. I hiked great falls to Georgetown in a nice flat towpath that is my local weekend jaunt, just to get some mileage in and see the super flooded and high Potomac River after all the rain and snow melt we have had. That was Saturday, towards the end of the hike my right hip flexor was starting to really bug me and it become fairly painful to take steps, other wise I felt pretty good but I got some pinky toe blisters. I think I'll start trying to do hip flexor stretches to help prevent it from hurting on long hikes. I may have to buy bigger/wider shoes, not sure why my toes are being smashed all of the sudden.I then did Old Rag circuit with my girlfriend on Sunday. For some bizarre reason this mountain and my bowels are linked. I NEVER have to go to the bathroom(bathroom=#2) on day hikes but out of the 5 times I've summited old rag, I've had emergency bathroom breaks about half way up 3 different times now. (LNT was used) Anyways, aside from poorly treated pinky toe blisters from the previous hike they got very angry towards the end of this one and I was limping pretty good the last 2 miles. But no serious knee or hip pain while walking on this hike. I am still going to go to the doctor soon and see what else I can be doing to minimize the pain for knees and hip flexor.3Old Rag is one of my favorite day hikes, it's scenic and has an intense climb with a spectacular payout once you hit the rocks. If you are within a 3-4 hour drive or section hiking the AT I highly recommend you check this mountain out.The funny thing about Old Rag is you see some people who have no business doing these rock scramble. About 15-20 minutes before the summit we passed a couple just riding the struggle bus trying to scramble up. I'm all for getting as many people as possible to see these types of views but this woman had worn down sneakers without tred without and gear and in blue jeans and had to to be pushed up and over several rocks by other hikers. We commented to ourselves that for her safety we hope she turns back soon, but hey HYOH and we kept going. After we were about 1/3 down the mountain we ran into a ranger asking about a couple who should have been home by now and it fit the description of the couple hiking without proper gear or footware. I gave them my best estimation of where they would be and we went on our way. I imagine they had to hike for at least 2 hours in pitch black depending if they turned back or tried to summit and hike the easier fire road down the other side. I doubt they had a light with them so it may have been a very long, cold, and dark walk to the car. When we passed her sunset was only an hour and a half away. As soon as I summited we kicked it into gear and held a 3-4mph pace the whole way to our car and it was still completely dark when we arrived. Anyways, Old Rag is one of my favorite hikes in SNP and for anyone on the AT if you have the time I recommend a little side hike to check it out.So overall my little 24 mile weekend went well other than some sore feet and a hip flexor issue which I will work on. I'm trying with what little free time I have to stack big miles to see how my body handles it. It seems 10 miles right now is my pain free and no recovery needed limit. Pushing now to be able to do 2 15's back to back with the same feeling and then up it to 20's back to back. It should take me all summer to get there but I am doing everything I can to prepare for this trail. These prehikes are also training for my big AT training hike on the 70 mile Laurel Highlands Trail. My girlfriend and I are planning to do it in early June. We both are trying to be able to hit at least 15 mile days since we have to do a 17 and a 19 mile day on that hike.",,Pre Hike #5,"Feb 28, Sun",0
Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522512,"I've been doing lots of research on hammocks and the Benton MacKaye Trail. I think I will be using a hammock on my thru, and starting out, doing a large portion of the BMT as an alternate to the AT to avoid some of the early crowds since I'm leaving around the peak start time. I think this will give me the extra adventure I'm seeking and also keep me away from big crowds and give me some alone time to start out on the trail. I will have plenty of time to socialize on this hike, why rush it. As for a hammock, I will be using the Warbonnet XLC blackbird my girlfriend gave me as an xmas present last year. She got me a tarp for it as a gift for xmas this year. Now I just need to figure out how to use the thing in storms and learn all the ins and outs. I've been going down the hammock rabbithole a lot lately looking at videos from shug and reading on the hammock forums.This weekend my girlfriend and I will be hiking the Signal Knob circuit hike. It's a ten mile loop and it was used as a confederate lookout during the war. I love hikes that have a little history mixed in.Still awaiting results from doctor and was referred to a podiatrist for all the crazy foot pain I'm having. So hopefully that goes well. Overall the training and diet is generally going well so far. Until Next time,",,Pre Hike #6,"Mar 04, Fri",0
Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522699,"Well, I hiked Signal knob twice this weekend. Once solo, once with my girlfriend to check it out and get some decent miles in. I felt pretty good overall. I did the 10 mile loop both timesIn about 4 hours. Pretty happy with pace considering the climb and amount of large rocks coming down the second half. Little soreness in toes but no blisters and only a little tiny bit of knee pain but it went away fairly fast. I met a thru hiker named SciFi who is going to start his flip flop from Harper's Ferry in a month. Signal Knob is a very pretty hike and it's only 60 miles from DC so it is a nice ""quick"" place to hit for a day out. I also got to test out my new hammock tarp at the top and learn a little about tying it down. Next week will be Dolly Sods 22 mile overnight. I absolutely love this hike and hopefully I'll post a few good pictures next week. That's all for now.",,Pre Hike #7,"Mar 05, Sat",0
Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523486,Whoops. Ended up sticking around home and hiking great falls. I got cocky and was basically trail running with a 30 pound pack on and rolled my ankle pretty good on some tree roots on a sandy downhill section. Have to keep off for 3 days and hopefully by 2 weeks I'll be hiking again.Luckily the x rays don't show a break. Now I have to really be careful and strengthen this ankle back up. So I think I'll be using poles and boots for everything for a bit until I feel comfortable in low cut shoes again hiking. Hopefully dolly sods will happen in 2 weeks.,,Pre Hike #8,"Mar 12, Sat",0
Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532329,"Just A quick update. I've gone on two hikes since my injury and I'm still recovering. Sprains take FOREVER to heal. I did a 15 mile 2 day in Seneca Creek WV. by mile 7-8 my foot was killing me each day. I did a day hike last weekend at signal Knob and almost re injured it. The rocks there are brutal and again by mile 8 my ankle was shot. I hope in another month I can do more miles without the extreme pain. I still get some pains just walking around day to day. I need to heal ASAP so I can continue my training hikes.One other note is the sad passing of Baltimore Jack the thru hiker / trail angel. I was looking forward to meeting him on my hike next year. He does a great interview on the Pox and Puss podcast if you're interested to hear some of his stories.

My girlfriend and I will be hiking the Laurel Highlands Trail in central PA. It's a pretty easy trail compared to the AT, we have 3 days at over 15 miles out of the five. I'll be doing all 70 miles with everything I need to survive on my back for 5 days. You don't need to bring shelter for this trail as there are shelters spaced along it but for training purposes I'm going to bring my hammock as backup plus its great to have a hammock and relax. Once we finish we have some rafting and sightseeing planned. We should be around the halfway point on the 4th of July. I'm excited. My ankle still hurts sometimes and rocky terrain still agitates it but overall its finally starting to get better after like 2.5 months. Gear is nearly dialed in besides dropping 1.5 pounds for a zpacks backpack. Base weight is running around 15 pounds for an AT 3 season setup. In the summer i'll be able to ditch a few things and lighten up even more. Less than 9 months and I'll be on trail. Slowlyyy starting to get real. Once I'm on the LHHT i'll try and make a few posts to try out trail journals from the trail.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539870,"Quick update: Did 20 miles in PA with the DC UL hiking group on the AT this weekend then had lunch in Gettysburg. No blisters and minimal soreness. The training and daily walking is helping a ton. I also have my general base weight down to about 14 pounds. Making a few adjustments to getting ahead of some pain/chafing issues but otherwise it was a great shakedown before the big 70 miler starting Saturday. Weather forecast is looking great. Low 80 highs and low 60 lows with no rain for all five days! I'm still nervous about hiking so much back to back but hopefully my body handles it. The mileage splits are 14/20/14/17/6.One MAJOR issue left is my ankle STILL hurts a ton after five miles of walking and I begin over compensating and it seems the knee on that side will start to hurt.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543507,"Gear is always the topic of conversation among hikers. As I get more and more miles under my belt I am starting to “zero” in a bit more my personal preferences. Here are some cheap tips and things that I have been doing to improve my comfort and lower my weight on the trail. I’ve also done some expensive improvements but I won’t waste my time writing an entry on why spending 600 dollars to upgrade your sleeping bag and pack is a worthwhile investment.  You may know some of these or not but I thought for less experienced 2017ers some of these tips may be useful for lowering their weight and improving their hiking efficiency. H.Y.O.H., but these are simple things I have done to lower my pack weight since a low weight is important to me and it may also be for you. There is no wrong way to hike! (Unless it’s by car!) #1. Trash bags. Among newbie hikers (myself included when I started, I’m the proud owner of 2 covers) it is assumed a rain cover for your pack is a must. I’ll be blunt here, after logging many days in the rain it is not. A cheap and more waterproof method is getting a large contractor bag and using it as a liner. It weighs an ounce and is free if you already have some. Keep it open and just tie it up before a big storm comes. Rain covers collect a lot of water at the bottom when walking and have a tendency to soak the bottom of your bag. #2. Water Bottles. When I started hiking, the Nalgene bottle was the gold standard for water bottles. Durable, reliable, iconic water bottles. However as I hike more and more I don’t bring them along on any hike unless I’m just going to the gym or on a road trip. They are expensive and heavy when a much cheaper and lightweight alternative is available. To cut some ounces and save a few bucks, any trip I go on I bring two smart water bottles and a 2L Evernew bladder for dirty water. They come with free water are pretty durable and weigh next to nothing. If you want a more Nalgene feel some people prefer Gatorade bottles. #3. Ziploc bags. Instead of buying a fancy hiker wallet, fancy little mesh bag or whatever zip lock bags come in all shapes and sizes are cheap waterproof and they are clear for easy access. Transfer food, smaller items, or whatever from their heavy package into smaller and cheaper zip lock bags. Did I mention they are waterproof? I throw my cellphone and camera into one during rain hiking. #4 A Swiss army knife. We all pack our fears when we go into the wilderness. When I started hiking I brought along my grandfather’s 1lb navy k-bar. It is basically a bayonet, it’s still in my hiker bin for some reason. I was ready for anything! But the more you hike the more you realize you don’t need to be ready for anything …you only need to be ready for what might happen on a trail. Unless you are a trained and skilled knife fighter, cutting the occasional package, sausage, or rope is about all you need a knife for. I use the Swiss army classic SD (the smallest one). It weighs less than an ounce and costs 15$ and has a few other useful tools for foot care or basic emergencies. On my 5 day 70 mile trip two weeks ago I used it once to cut open a tear tab on a mountain house meal. You just don’t need a huge knife on the trail. #5 Trail-runners or hiking shoes. This will be a bit more controversial suggestion especially from someone who sprained their ankle recently. It didn’t have anything to do with my footwear! The claim is every pound on your foot is equal to 5 pounds on your back. Shave some weight and hike in lighter shoes. You’ll quickly realize from all the hikers who are doing the exact same trail as you that the same hike can be done in skimpy trail runners. They are lighter, dry out faster, and will tend to cause fewer foot injuries like blisters. It will also make your hike a lot easier than slogging in massive boots that weigh a bunch. They are also WAY more comfortable and depending on the person may eliminate the need for camp shoes. Once I switched to trail runners I stopped bringing my sandals for camp shoes. These are just some personal preferences that I hope in some small way save you some cash and make your hike more enjoyable!",,Pre-Hike #13,"Jul 25, Mon",0

Once you reach the upper mountain its hand and foot climbing for about an hour an half. There are quite a few spots where an extra hand is needed and you need to remove your backpack. We took a friend who had never been and he enjoyed it a lot. We timed our descent well, a huge summer storm hit as we were descending back to the car. Had it come an hour earlier and things would have been dangerous, the rock is like ice when it's wet. The first time we ever did it was in the rain and I slipped on a rock and blew some part of my rotator cuff in my shoulder. This however was a fun trip with some more weekends to come.,

September 2nd 3rd and 4th
Had a great training hike last weekend, night hiked in from Weaverton Cliffs parking lot 3 miles to Ed Garvey Shelter. Saturday I did 21 miles to Pogo Camp Site a bit past Annapolis Rocks. The next day I hiked 10 miles to Raven Rocks and called it a hike. I intended to go into PA for one more day but I pushed myself a bit too hard doing 21 miles and was pretty drained after doing 10 the following day. My only issue was a blister and going abnormally slow uphill. I had planned to do 19 but ran out of gas. I also met 2 SOBO's on my hike who were interested in my pack. The one hiker emphasized how horrible the PA rocks were having just come from them. He asked where I was headed and I said ""I'm only attempting about 50 miles over 3 days while I train for my 2017 NOBO hike"" and he was impressed with how many miles I was doing already. In other news, it was my first time testing my new Z Packs backpack. It's great. A few minor issues I need to work out but overall it's lighter and has more features, it also looks pretty snazzy in orange. I'm starting to feel that as long as I don't suffer an injury I can nail this through hike next year.

Well, Its been 6 months exactly since I sprained my ankle. It clearly was worse than I thought or the doctors said because its been 6 months and the damn thing still hurts. Albeit a much more mild and nagging pain. I'd say its 90-95% healed. I am still doing stretches and ankle exercises to get it stronger. I hope come March its ready for 2,000+ miles. The next 3 days DC is expected to get record rain following a bad drought with flash flood warnings in effect. I hope to get some miles in this weekend doing something local just to get 10-15 miles on Sunday in the mud. Also, Anna and I have made plans to move to the Denver area when I return from my hike and give the area a shot. 2016-2017 will end up being a pretty damn busy time. I got engaged, will be attempting an AT thru hike (quit my job), will move to the Denver area, and will be getting starting a new job once there. Also, Anna's sister is getting married October 2017 so we'll have to hustle to Boston after we move to attend her wedding. I'll be honest, quitting my job and moving across country is more intimidating to me than doing this hike. I think that is a good sign that I am about ready to take a shot at a thru hike.",,Pre-Hike #14,"Aug 06, Sat",0

This trip was more about exploring than hiking miles and I had a blast. The first day was super cold and windy and rainy from Hurricane Matthew. The weather was perfect the next two days. We climbed Mt. Rodgers the highest point in VA at 5,700 ft. It's a viewless summit but was still cool. We dried our gear and found a great campsite with amazing views and had some pony guests with us throughout the night. The trip was definitely worth the 5.5 hours of driving each way.

It's 9.3 miles with about 2k gain. It was a really pretty fall hike to go on and see the leaves changing in SNP. I saw a 6 point and an 8 point buck very close to us on the trail. The Hawksbill mountain summit was pretty but super crowded with tourists because there is a parking lot .8 miles at the bottom, the rest of the hike you don't really see anyone. Got to hike a few miles of NOBO AT which had some pretty views. After the hike we went to Skyland and had a nice dinner. If you eat at Skyland make sure to eat in the dining room, the mountain room food isn't quite as good.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552403,"I went on another weekend trip with the D.C. ultra light hiking group on Saturday and Sunday. We did 20 miles at Caledonia State Park in PA. I wanted to go on this trip to test my hammock and also get some practice in low temperatures. The low Saturday night was around 20 degrees maybe colder. I was pretty warm in the hammock. I did make the mistake of assuming my side pocket in my hammock was close enough to me that the things inside of the pocket wouldn't freeze. So my water/filter/phone all got a cold blast. I'll have to get a new water filter now because if any water freezes inside of it, it can no longer safely filter out harmful entities in the water. It also snowed about a quarter inch in the morning and it was really beautiful hiking back to the car.We had a great fire and it was a really good group of people we had lots of snacks and whiskey to go around. I was most excited because I got to meet two ex thru hikers who were on the trip. One, Boomerang just finished in 2016. He gave me some tips and it was a great confidence booster getting to talk to him and simply hearing him tell me I'm doing the right kind of shakedowns and have the right kind of gear. He also hiked with Coach for 700 miles and Coach was a trail journaler I really enjoyed following along with last year. He told me he may do the CDT with Coach this year. I also met Honey Do who hiked in 09. He lives not far from the PA section of the trail and gave me his number and said He'll give me trail magic when I get up to PA. The hike went well, I had issues with overheating and when to peel layers but this was mostly due to the group I was in. I didn't ever really want to stop because the group pretty much did both days with minimal stopping and I felt bad holding anyone up. Next week is going to be quiet because I'm heading off to the Bahamas on Sunday with my fiancee and her family.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552682,I just got back from an 8 day cruise to the Bahamas over Christmas. I had the pleasure of hiking at a staggering elevation of sea level. The quarter mile hike to the beach after the 2 mile kayak trip may have had the best view payoff yet. They filmed two pirates of the Caribbean movies on that beach and national geographic listed it in the top ten best beaches in the world (According to our guide). I had a great vacation and now it's all business as I prepare for my AT trip. The counter on my computer says 83 days remain. I haven't quite accepted I'm leaving that soon. Time to start walking more every day and getting back in shape before it's time to start. Next month I notify my employer and client of my plans. The butterflies are definitely starting.,,Pre-Hike #19,"Dec 26, Mon",0
Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553131,"No turning back now. I notified the remainder of my friends and family of my intentions via Facebook and will spend the remaining days organizing my gear and hitting the gym. I definitely can drop a few pounds and start to condition myself a little for what my future holds. Hiking has helped me dial in and prepare my feet and legs but I need to lighten my weight a bit more by working out.  I'm very excited to be in the final phase before my departure. Less than 70 days remain! The name of the game is to not get injured doing silly stuff before I leave like skiing. I'm an amateur skier at best and as temping as it is to hit the slopes this winter I am restraining as an added precaution. Below is what I posted to my Facebook page. To those of you who haven't made the announcement yet, feel free to plagiarize me!""To my friends and family,To avoid any confusion, I thought this would be a good place to let people who don’t yet know what I’m planning on doing this coming spring. On March 21st, 2017 I’m resigning from my job in DC and hitting the Appalachian Trail to attempt to complete the trail in its entirety in one continuous hike. The Appalachian Trail is roughly 2,200 miles long and goes through 14 states. Starting on Springer Mountain in Georgia and reaching its terminus on top of Mt. Katahdin in Baxter State Park, Maine. Numbers are rough but about 4-5 thousand people will attempt a thru hike this year. Roughly one in four make it all the way. I know statistically speaking I have to surpass a lot of odds, Mt. Everest summit attempts have a slightly higher success rate. My main issues personally will be injury to my knees and ankles. The likelihood of dying in the attempt is minimal, but the likelihood of being injured is high. Some injuries are permanent and some require surgery to correct. Some require weeks of rest and recovery which in many cases leads to abandoning ones hike. I will be attempting this hike solo, but due to the increasingly large number of people attempting it, I won’t be totally alone and will in all likelihood be hiking in various small groups through my trek. The biggest threats to my safety and health are Lyme’s disease, waterborne illnesses, and various overuse injuries. Lightning, bears, and crazy hillbillies with banjos are certainly a threat to be mitigated but present a low risk to my safety. There have been 11 murders on the AT since the 1960’s, this is lower than any mid sized cities murder rate in the United States even in a single year.My pack will weigh between 16-30 pounds on any given day and I will be hiking anywhere from 1-7 days between towns and resupply opportunities. To get my food I will be shopping in grocery stores, Walmart’s, and shady gas stations, just like you. To many peoples chagrin the AT is on a very populated corridor along the East Coast never being a short drive or a day’s walk from any town. Only becoming truly isolated towards the northern end of the trail in New England. I’m shooting to average between 12-20 miles per day possibly going as high as 30 miles in a single day in flatter areas. A thru hike typically takes 5-6 months of continuous walking mixed in with days off in hostels or hotels.While I can answer almost any question about the AT itself, the question hardest to answer is why I would want to do such a thing. I won’t begin to attempt a full explanation here. All I can say is it’s something I need to attempt to satisfy a personal long term goal I have set for myself. Even within the trail community “Why” is one of the hardest things to put into words. As far as budget goes a very general rule of thumb is about $1,000 a month strictly for food, occasional hostels, and some gear replacement. This does not include health insurance, credit card, student loan debt, and the 4-6 pairs of shoes I will go through. I’ve been planning this hike for over 3 years now and feel confident I am ready mentally and financially.All I can do now is be optimistic that I have done most of what I can to prepare and now to wait until my flight to Atlanta. There are superb athletes who are injured and never finish while overweight 70 year old retirees and blind men who have made it all 2,200 miles, it’s truly a gamble and hard to identify what it takes to succeed other than sheer willpower. My Facebook for the next few months will mostly be pictures and brief blurbs of my days. If you’re curious about what gear I’m using you can go here: https://lighterpack.com/r/krczm. Also, I’ll be keeping an online journal here: http://www.trailjournals.com/RabbitHole of my progress but I’m not sure how often I’ll be able to update it. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have about it. A few people have expressed interest in supporting my hike financially. I won’t stop you, feel free to help fund my expenses via Venmo (www.venmo.com/Fritschya ) or Paypal (Paypal.Me/AndrewFritsch) if you are so inclined.To anyone reading and going to themselves, I should do something like that. Please go and do it. Don’t wait, life is too short to bank on retirement or ""the right time"". Go now, put your life on pause and pursue a dream while you can. The pursuit of a dream is far more important than playing it safe. You won’t be able to conquer your goal without taking the first step. Don’t be afraid to fail, be proud you made an attempt to accomplish something.""",,Pre-Hike #20,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553619,"I spent the day working from home due to the inauguration followed by some gym time and relaxation. I've been kind lazy on the hiking front so I'm making up for it by going to the gym consistently. I also went shopping for some final REI supplies. Mostly socks and underwear but also a small knee brace and a nice 2.2oz titanium cup. I didn't plan on bringing a cup but it was on sale and it's light. I don't really drink coffee so I'll mostly be making tea or kool aid or some sort of concentrated drink.  The AT is getting nail bitingly close now. I'm starting to hand over certain responsibilities to my fiancee which she will have to handle while I am away. I don't think she has accepted I'm leaving in 2 months. One thing on my to do list is to switch cell phone providers. I currently use Sprint but from my own experience hiking and asking many thru hikers Verizon is the best carrier on the trail. Not to mention Sprint has some unrelated issues and it's time to switch. Due to the political transition work has slowed down a bit as my office awaits new management which leaves me more time to obsess and dwell down many rabbit holes of thru hiking. Luckily, I have another shakedown hike planned for this coming weekend with the DC ultra-light backpacking group. A nice 15 mile weekend hike expecting wintry conditions. Due to the chance of snow, ice, and low temps I am basically packing my exact setup I'll be taking with me to Springer with the exception of my micro-spikes, I don't think I'll need them enough to justify them on the AT. Ah, as I write this I forgot my biggest item on my to-do list still remains. In about a week I dive into selecting a private health insurance plan. Due to the new administration this is a pretty touchy issue for me. I was intending on going with the affordable care act AKA Obamacare. However, I am now considering other options as well due to the fact it is possible the ACA will disappear while I am hiking. Unfortunately COBRA is almost twice as expensive as an ACA plan. As we get closer, I will only write 1 or 2 more pre-hike entries before I leave in 56 days for Atlanta. It's interesting I think I have hit peak anxiety about my hike. I'm becoming more focused with what needs to happen at home while I am away or any administrative or financial tasks that must be done during my hike rather than the hike itself. It's liberating because I am still a ball of nerves about this but I think it is getting better. I'm taking many hikers advice and simply letting go before I begin. I've totally ignored any and all daily trail planning such as resupply or planned mileage. I'm simply going to hike and plan as I go with the exception of my self imposed speed limit of about 10 miles a day for the first week or so. To all the other 17ers that will be leaving starting around now and all the way into July for the SOBO's, I wish you all a successful hike and I hope to see you out on the trail!",,Pre-Hike #21,"Jan 20, Fri",0

I don't think this will affect me but if the AT's popularity continues to increase eventually this will become a huge deal.

I only have my first three days to Neel's gap planned the rest I'll be winging as I go. My plan will be to keep things under 10 miles a day until my body adjusts over the first 5 days or so. This will be hard for me since I am capable of up to about 20 right now, sitting around at a campsite for half your day when you know you have 2,000+ miles to go will be a test of willpower and ego. But, I need to listen to my body and prioritize my physical health above all else which means I gotta take it slow and ease into the miles. Currently I'm in Pittsburgh seeing some family and friends one last time before I hit the trail. I'm also celebrating my 28th birthday and as a gift to myself I'll be filing taxes and picking my ACA plan(I can't imagine doing anything more fun), next week is car state inspection, cell phone plan switching, and handing over the last of the utilities to Anna.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556268,"T -7 days to go. A few updates both good and bad.-Sprained my ankle AGAIN last week on my final prep hike being stupid and zoning out. Fortunately it was super minor because I did it on mile 8/16 and completed the remaining 8 miles without pain or issue but there was definitely a small pop. I'm a week out since I did it and aside from some extra soreness doing odd movements, walking causes no pain. (see earlier entry from my first sprain this year)-On the final shakedown I brought everything I am taking to Springer and mostly good news on the gear front. I happened to hike during a massive cold snap and the low was around 18 or so and windy. It was cold but I didn't die, I didn't break out the rain jacket as the final layer and I have 1 hothands in reserve for emergencies so I should be able to survive a night down to about 10 I imagine. Below that might be dangerous but I don't expect hitting that low of a temp at this point in the year and if I do I can easily plan around it and sleep in a hostel.-I did 16 miles (and sprained an ankle) but by the next morning I felt pretty good with minimal soreness and could have easily hiked 10 miles +. One nagging concern is the brand of shoes I've been using for two years, suddenly they're a bit narrow and causing a big issue on a toe on my left foot. The nail may come off when I start hiking more but I'll deal with it. I have a final podiatrist appointment on Friday.-Health insurance is taken care of, cell phone is now on Verizon, money is ready, bills are transferred, car stuff is done. Made a few repairs to the house so hopefully my handyman skills won't be required. Gear is being obsessed over, everything is going according to plan. -I'm extremely nervous about spraining my ankle now so I will be hiking at a much slower rate until the muscles strengthen back up. I hope after a week or two of walking I can trust them more but for now they are definitely weaker albeit pain free and more sprain prone than ever.-This last week is going to kill me. Everyday I'm becoming more anxious and obsessive about this hike, I washed my hands with toothpaste this morning without noticing until halfway done. I'm usually not nervous about flying but I've been having some anxiety about it for some reason. Maybe I shouldn't have watched Alive last night. I also am worried they are going to lose my huge duffel-bag with ALL of my gear.-Work is concluding, and I get a snow day tomorrow due to a Nor Easter in bound to the Mid Atlantic. 4 work days left, that is a whole other weird thing. I've been working for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within the DOE since I graduated school, it's a little weird ending my first job out of college after five years. I hope once this adventure is over I find a job that makes me as satisfied as when I was working for EERE.-I'm going to miss the hell out of Anna but we've been preparing and worst case is about 8-10 weeks without seeing one another. Hopefully around trail days time we hit Damascus together. In the meantime we have facetime and can talk often so it won't be a total communication blackout.-This time next week I'll be at the Hike Hostel in Georgia.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556733,I have a few new followers and this site isn't the greatest so I created a wordpress blog to go along with this trail journal. They will have identical content moving forward but the UI will be much better over on wordpress.rabbitholehikes.wordpress.com   ------ also my instagram is @FritschyaSo a few UpdatesI got a lot done today and I'm feeling accomplished.One of my final to do's was to get a Tetanus shot since I am right up against the ten year shelf life they are supposed to last. I went to the urgent care up the street since it was early and I knew they wouldn't be busy. There was no wait and then I hit the jackpot and had a doctor who was an ex army medic and a recreational hiker. He gave me a prescription for Dexacycl..something which is an antibiotic for tick bites without my asking for it. He sad keep that bottle with you and if you get a rash start taking them and you should be fine. Next up I had my final podiatrist appointment. My feet are finally in pretty good shape aside from my messed up nail. She got them in as good of shape as possible before I beat them into hamburger meat putting 2200 miles on them. The doctor wished me luck and gave me some good suggestions on commercial insoles if I need them.I quit my job today. Today was my last day at work which really put me into the mindset that this is real now and happening very soon. I'm excited about my new job of walking ten hour days.On the gear front I made a last minute change on my tarp suspension and will meet up with my newly ordered gear at the hostel in Georgia. I didn't want to risk it not getting here in time so I 2 day expressed it to the hostel so it should be waiting for me upon my arrival. Instead of stretchy shock cord I'm going with something that will be a little sturdier against heavy wind so my tarp wont give much in storms.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557083,"Today was the travel day to get to the Hiker Hostel an hour north of Atlanta. The flight went well. There was no line for security at DCA so I was about an hour early. Then the plane came in about 20 minutes early so I had almost 2 hours to kill before my pickup at the North Springs Marta stop. In the airport I had a delicious Rueben and IPA to wash it down while I killed some time. Then I took the 45 minute metro ride from one end of the line to the other. After some waiting I met up with Drew(Tiger) and Anna who were also being picked up and taken to the hostel. Since the hostel doesn't do dinner (but they do make a massive breakfast that is supposedly legendary) so we stopped at Walmart and bought steaks and frozen pizza to make for dinner. We arrived at the hostel and as I keep hearing it is the most impressive hostel on the trail. It's very nice and spacious with two communal areas and two kitchens. We have been just hanging out cooking and talking on the back deck about random hiking topics and the merits of taking springer directly or using the 8 mile approach trail. Likely more on that tomorrow. So now after a busy day of travel, I'm relaxing in the only single room because I won the Hiker lottery (we all are paying the hiker special) but it's mostly bunks and shared spaces. There are 19 hikers here tonight, about half from up the trail, some resting up injuries and others like me beginning tomorrow. There is a man in his 80's here who has hiked the entire thing twice and may go all the way on number three starting tomorrow. It's been a great relaxing day and a great way to slowly submerse myself into the hiking culture.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557138,"Day 1Today went well! Our day started at 7 for breakfast at the Hiker Hostel. After a great breakfast we settled up and got into a shuttle for the approach trail or, a shuttle for springer mountain. The split was about 60/30 for Springer mountain with me included. That was a very interesting car ride to the mountain. I've been on a lot of mountain roads but inside of this old van that had to have had 250k plus miles on it let's just say my odds of kidney stones are pretty low now. So we all got dropped off 1 mile from the base of the mountain. Where the drop off is, is actually 1 mile north on trail of the start so you must back track the mile to the beginning all of it a fairly easy uphill to the first white blaze then turn around and head back down to the parking lot headed north. That was the easiest mile of my life due to the adrenaline and excitement I had. To my surprise there were only about 8 people at the top at 10:30 when I started out. Today I did 8.1 Miles of trail and 9.1 with the back track. I felt good and the trail was mostly flat and downhill with a few moderate hills. I love hiking in the south really beautiful pines and good views. I arrived at the shelter at 2:30 which is super early but I got to cook a late lunch and meet some thru hikers. I met Action Jackson who hiked the PCT last year and seems to have some really good Hiker meals made up involving tortillas Oreos and Nutella. I checked the weather and there is a very strong thunder storm headed this way in the evening and if the warning is correct it has 60 MPH winds and ping pong sized hail in some areas. I'm a little nervous but this should be a good test for my setup and it's very early in the trip so if it fails I can regroup. The hail is the only threat because it could puncture my tarp. If it gets bad I'll seek shelter in the three sided shelter but I doubt I will have to. I'm warm and dry in my hammock resting and waiting for the storm. So far this has been a great start to my hike! Let's see how this thunderstorm goes tonight... I'll be listening to the shawshank redemption on Audio book tonight. So far it is a healthy amount different from the movie and quite enjoyable. The biggest difference being Red is a white Irish guy. That's all for now.","Hiker Hostel

Running low on data so no pictures but some were larger than quarters. I was just waiting for my tarp to get punctured but it never came. Aside from that I stayed dry and mostly warm. Today I hiked about 8 miles to Gooch Mountain Shelter and again came in super early. There are a lot of hikers here so I've been hanging out socializing and trying to eat some of the excess food I brought to cut pack weight. Feet are hurting a bit but I'm hoping that will subside as I hike more. Today was a good day.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557380,"Day 3Well I kind of accidentally hiked 16.5 instead of 12 due to some camping regulations with bear canisters which forced me to summit blood mountain and hit mountain crossings a day early. I'm a bit sore but feeling ok. Today was mostly a pretty great day(I lost my phone charger cable but bought a new one at the outfitter). I wanted to get an early start so I was up by 7 and on the trail by 8 so I skipped breakfast and was going to eat some cliff bars as I walked. Surprisingly about a mile up trail was my first official trial magic of my hike! For those of you that don't know trail magic, it is just food or drinks given or at a parking lot of road crossing for thru hikers and it can be a huge mental booster for hikers. So the trail provided and these two awesome gentleman were making omelets and coffee for hikers. So I ended up having a ham omelet and a banana which was much needed since I unknowingly was going to have a 16.5 mile day. Another 5 Miles in just as lunch time was calling me I got more trail magic at another crossing and had beef lentil soup and green tea which was excellent. It was good timing becauSe after that I began the long ascent of Blood Mountain which is the the highest point of the AT in Georgia. It was a solid 4 miles straight of gain and was challenging but not as hard as other hikers I have talked to made it sound which was a nice confidence booster. I also bumped into a fan who happens to follow my blog and recognized me. She is the wife of another thru Hiker named Toast who I camped with two nights in a row including the hail storm which is still the talk of trail. I have heard several people dropped out on their first or second night being freaked out by the storm. So as I ascended I kept leap frogging with two hikers who stayed with me last night. As I ascended my blood sugar crashed a bit near the top so I ate a few cliff bars and felt better. The summit was amazing and there is a stone shelter at the top. But I continued on 2 miles to Neels gap where there is an outfitter. The 2 miles down were harder than the five or so up because of how steep it is, it's a bit hard on the knees. So I made it to the outfitter, bought some food and supplies for the next few days and had a frozen pizza made for me there. I inquired to stay at the hostel they have behind the outfitter for 15 dollars a night but it was full so I hikedj a half mile v or so up the hill and that's where I am now. I camped with the two I was leap frogging and there is a loose plan to make it to Dicks Creek Gap 40 miles ahead over the next three days but I'm not sure I want to do another 17-18 miles tomorrow so I'll see how I'm feeling when I reach the next shelter ten miles ahead. The trail will be a lot easier tomorrow. My Knee and bad ankle are a bit sore but doesn't seem worse than yesterday. Tonight is supposed to be a little colder tonight with a low of 40.

There were almost no views up there from being inside of clouds but it was pretty in its own way. After the initial climb I think I hovered around 4K until I hit some nasty straight ups and downs at various gaps. I hiked solo today and am now camping solo on a ridge. My plan is to try and make Dicks Creek Gap Sunday go into town overnight and take a zero day (rest day) Monday. To do that I have to hike 15 tomorrow and the day after which I think I can do, but I need to recover a bit tonight hopefully. I still have way too much food so I'm trying to eat a little extra. It doesn't help I don't really eat breakfast or much more than a few cliff bars for lunch so I'll try taking a little more time for eating more substantial food. Tray Mountain is the goal tomorrow. It's windy and peaceful up on the ridge I'm camped on. Hopefully I sleep well so I can get up early for another big day.","Hill Above Neels Gap

I was solo camping so I thought I might be faster but I still seem to zone out while packing up all the same. Today had a good bit of straight up and downs like yesterday but more good views. Also, I had another encounter with Trail magic at Unicoi Gap. They had hotdogs and hamburgers and drinks. I ate two hot dogs and two hamburgers and immediately regretted it during the steep climb out of the gap. Also, the legendary Ms. Janet rolled up in her van during my burgers. She is by far the most well known trail angel on the AT making her the most well known in the world one could argue. She took some people I was hiking with into town for supplies or their zero day. My knees are still bothering me but I feel relieved it's not just me many 20 year olds are also complaining about their knees. It was 3 large climbs today and 2 steep downhills to sum up the 14 miles. I think I prefer uphill to the steep drops due to ware and tare and additional injury risk going downhill. I'm at the shelter now ready for a pretty decent storm. A lot of us at the shelter we're swapping bad weather stories and even for some who have camped out much much more than I have said that hail storm was their toughest night out. One doctor who is thru hiking with his wife told us a story about how the roof was ripped off of his hotel he was staying at while hiking in 2011 from a tornado. Pretty crazy story, people died and he did an emergency triage at a truck stop to sum it up. I'm camped at 4200 feet only 200 lower than the summit which worries me about potential lighting. Other wise I'm comfy in my hammock. I have to get out early tomorrow incase rain slows me down. I have to make 10 miles before 3 that's when my ride picks me up and I take my first zero day on Monday in Hiawassi. Taco Bell is calling my name from here.","poplar stamp gap

I made a challenging 11 Miles by 2ish and was picked up with a few other hikers at Dicks Creek Gap and taken into Hiawassee for tonight and tomorrow night to rest a little. The budget inn is full of hikers tonight. Took a rejuvenating shower then had late lunch at Dairy Queen and Dinner at Taco Bell. Grabbed a few supplies at Rite Aid next door and will try and eat a bit more healthy tomorrow. Tomorrow is shopping and laundry and taking it easy so my knee can recover. The knee and a pinky toe blister are the only major issues I have 70 miles in. Hopefully they subside quickly before I start back up Tuesday.

Today I got on the 11am shuttle back to Dicks Creek and did an 11.8 mile day nearly entirely up hill the whole way. Today was also a nice Milestone day, today marks the longest hike I've ever done since 70 miles was my prior record from last summer. Also, I hiked to a new state today! I'm officially in North Carolina now. I chatted it up with a few hikers today and played leap frog as we all ascended the never ending mountain. I'm camped up at Muskrat Creek Shelter around 4400 feet. It hit 70 today so the weather has been a little warm for good hiking weather and was hot climbing. I met a lot of new faces at the shelter and everyone I meet in town or on trail remains as friendly as ever. I think tomorrow will be 12.5 Miles as we continue to go up some large mountains. I think this is the official welcome to North Carolina terrain. The goal is to make it 40 miles north and do an overnight but not a zero in Franklin TN Friday. As far as physical ailments go my pinky toe was hurting because I did a little too much foot surgery on it at the hotel and my knees have a slight tinge but it's more of an annoyance than show stopper so we'll see how it responds over the coming days / weeks. I may put some KT tape on it and see how that does tomorrow. I also need to investigate insoles that have more cushion and arch support. That may be what I'll do when I get to Franklin 40 miles north.No rain tonight which is nice but a low of 46 since we're so high up. Fun Fact: for every 1k feet in elevation gained the temp drops 3.3 degrees. The doctor from the tornado story is also a hammock guy and he and his wife are here again camped close by, that's the only people I've recognized tonight. Everyone here started the day after I did so at this point I've gained about a day to the average hiker but going to throttle back a little for the next few days trying to keep it under 15 for awhile.

My feet were getting pretty tired at the end ,I planned on only doing 12.5 but I made great time to the shelter despite today being mostly uphill. I leap frogged with some hikers as we ascended and ate and chatted it up once at the shelter but realizing it was only about 3 I continued on to a camp site about 4 miles ahead. I did get one awesome view up on a very high ridge around 5000 feet. Also, we are entering the damage from a massive forest fire and everything is becoming more and more charred and everything has a slight campfire scent to it. I bumped into Toast here! We shared the first few nights so we plan to get up early and enter Franklin together tomorrow to resupply. I think I'll spend a night there if I can find a room but if not I'll get back on and camp. Aside from Toast and a few others I haven't met up with a hiker who goes my pace and is a compatible hiking partner so hopefully I find one by the time I'm out of the smokies we seem to disappear for a few days and bump back into one another. There are some groups now but it's mostly the really young guys and you can tell already some can do more Miles than others which means someone will end the day unhappy. But so far so good for me, I'm enjoying my solitary style. I still talk to people as I walk and it seems like every campsite right now is busy so always conversations at night.Physically, the knees had the same slight twinge but the bottoms of my feet were what bothered me the most today. I received a nice helping of sunburn on my arms face and neck today, was exposed a lot today and forgot to use sunscreen in the warm weather. I think I need softer shoes or insoles. Perhaps at the next decent outfitter I'll see what I can do. It's weird to think but the shoes I'm using are nearly brand new in terms of time (maybe a month or two old) but I have nearly 200 miles on them from this hike and some previous hikes which means they're nearly 50% used up. I'm doing bigger miles than I Intended to do but I'm doing ok and I've still had a grin on my face at some point every day at least once if not many times even on the hard parts. I've been lucky with rain only had storms at night nothing really while hiking so I count myself lucky so far with weather. It's also been quite warm out so I hope that sticks around as I approach the Smokies. I'm camped at a nice campsite in the woods near a creek at 4000 feet. Quite a few people are here tonight and I have to get up around 6 tomorrow so I can make sure I have a 7am start with Toast, so I should be asleep by 9:30 despite all the camp fires tonight. No reception so sorry this is posted late. All is well hopefully I'll be in a room in Franklin TN tomorrow night.

As soon as we were about 2/3 up the fog rolled in giving us no view at the top at 5500. Toast and I made good time to winding stair Gap where our ride to the hotel would come. After about an hour detour for someone's trekking poles 14 miles down a backroad each way we finally arrived at town and split a room. We immediately went to the outfitter because Toast and I had some problems with our feet. We both ended up with new shoes and seem to be better than our old pairs. We grabbed burgers and I hit a grocery store for resupply. That night a huge thunder storm hit town but luckily we were indoors for it. Chatting with Toast has been fun and we hike a similar speed.

We are hiking through more and more severe fire damage from last Septembers Gatlinburg fire, google it if unfamiliar. After hiking an additional mile today for a bathroom break we kept a good clip up the big mountain. The views were amazing up there and we could even see the fire tower 20 miles away that we were on the day before. Toast had some extra food and gave me one of the dinners his wife has been sending him and they are amazing! Thank you Toasts wife for the great dinner tonight! We also hiked with mountain man and his tony dog, critter. I'm settled in now for a windy cold night at about 4400 feet.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558425,"Today was physically challenging but Toast and I both made it through. Today was a very long climb followed by an even steeper and longer descent. Descents are brutal on the knees and at certain points coming down the ridge was maybe 4 feet wide with hundreds of feet drop off on both sides. Toast said that's a good preview of New Hampshire hiking. Anyways out of the 15-20 people at our last Shelter only 4 people including me and Toast made it 15.5 miles today. The views were stunning and that is what I'll remember from today but luckily there is a Creek 50 feet from where I'm camped and I've soaked my feet a few times now. The feet are feeling better. It seems for every hiker this painful foot issue is occurring so I don't feel as concerned about it, and hope they will adapt over time. Toast left his trekking poles at the top of the tower and somehow some way the only other two people that came this far recognized his poles and carried them down for him. It was sheer luck and he was very grateful. I had dinner and it shouldn't rain so I'm camping without the tarp looking up at the stars from my hammock although the moon is pretty bright.    Tomorrow I get to go to the Nantahala Outdoors Center which has food options resupply and gear but the facility is mostly there for people rafting. But they have a restaurant there so at least I can have brunch and beer and a shower. My resupply comes in four days (Wednesday) to Fontana dam so I may have to take a 0 there and wait on it. depending on what Toast does he may continue on without me from there through the Smokies. We'll have to discuss it tomorrow. I dragged my feet figuring out what I needed so it will come in a day later than I was planning on.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558539,"Since we were camped a mile from the NOC everyone at the shelter packed up around 8 and made a dash down into the bottom of the valley for breakfast. Toast and I darted down and had some good food right on the river. We grabbed a few odds and ends at the gear shop and then crossed the river and hung out eating and doing some pack sorting. I filled up my water at the river hit the luxurious flush toilets and made our steep ascent to the shelter. Distance wise it was a short day but the hill made up for the low day in difficulty but we still made rather good time. Toast and I chatted with a trail volunteer and spoke about the fires and nearly 1500 firefighters from all over the country that came to the area to fight it. He also said that further up in the Smokies on this trail the area was ""devastated"". So I expect to see some totally burnt out areas in the Smokies. I've never walked through fire damage and it is horrible and beautiful in its town right. Don't forget forest fires are apart of the natural cycle of any forest. So we got to the shelter and saw a lot of familiar faces after a pretty good uphill out of the NOC. I think people are starting to open up more and become more friendly the more North we travel. It's a pretty neat thing to experience in person but hard to describe in a journal. But we're all doing the same terrain and having the same weather so there is a bond between us and mutual respect for everyone and it's very cool to share that with all the hikers one comes across. So I had dinner and did my camp chores and nestled into the hammock. I picked what I thought was an isolated spot for my hammock but there are so few good tent or hammock sites (in a steep valley with a creek in the middle) that after about three hours 5 tents have appeared right against my hammock, finding any semi flat ground they can. I feel like we're on Everest or something and this is the only usable flat space. Toast and I are only going nine miles tomorrow, now very close to Fontana Dam which is the last stop before entering Great Smoky Mountain National Park or SMNP for this journal. So once at Fontana dam I'll have to take a zero and wait for my supply to arrive with 8 days of food (nearly 16 pounds) and while there I will register for my SMNP permit which allows a maximum of 8 days to traverse the park or receive a fine unless you re register and pay another 20 dollars. I should cover the 80 miles in time as long as the weather cooperates. If the weather is bad or toast isn't feeling 100% he may zero with me before entering the park, but I'm pretty sure he's going on head on without me. But the ebb and flow of hikers up trail we will certainly link back up later. It's been another good day.","Rufus Morgan Shelter

After we got to the gap we ate a quick bar or two for lunch and then it began raining even harder with some thunder and lightning. As I was ascending higher and higher one or two lightning strikes happened but I counted the thunder after and nothing was closer then 15+ miles but it was still a little freaky. We got over the steep ridge and headed for our intended shelter. When we got there it was packed to the brim with people hiding out from the rains and it had poor tent selection so we stayed there for about 10 minutes waiting the rain out a little and quickly moved on so we could stay warm. We decided to head another 6 miles to Cable Gap Shelter and by the last 2 or 3 miles the rain had stopped. We got to camp, set up, and dried everything off while making dinner.

Today's climb was easy compared to other climbs it was somewhat low grade and had lots of switch backs. Once up on the first peak there was a tower but was missing a handrail and the stairs were icy and had falling ice coming down from upper parts of the tower. I went up two flights and took a few pictures then came back down since I wasn't feeling totally safe on this old tower. The views were great and I could see all the peaks ahead and above me were totally snow covered. Once I climbed into the snow zone the trail got very very muddy and my pace slowed considerably so I didn't want to fall and get soaked. My feet were pretty soaked all day but that's luckily all that got wet. I keep leapfrogging with a few groups. The military veteran group all hiking together, the Baltimore couple who are very nice, and the doctor and his wife who also hammock. So I ended up camping with the doctor and his wife.

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559823,"tri corner knob shelter 5,900 feet15.1 Miles, 222 Miles Hiked. Today was a great day. I grabbed breakfast and had a relaxing shower, packed up my gear and walked maybe half a mile to the NOC flagship gear store where the 11 am shuttle would be. I squeezed in to the van hosted by the Gatlinburg Baptist Church. They give two free shuttles a day to new found Gap which is a 30 mile round trip up a slow tourist mountain road. We went from 1k to 5k feet up to the gap. It was a very pretty drive and once at the gap other members of their church were giving out fruit, six inch subway sandwiches, energy bars, candy, and cookies. This church has a lot of very generous people , they also hosted a lot of families during the fires and what they do for free is astounding. I could have made a decent resupply out of the stuff they were giving out. It was excellent trail magic and I would have enjoyed it even more had I not just been in town. So I must say my feet felt great for 95% of my hike today all thanks to the tribiotic and the new shoe inserts. It made a huge difference and I also felt really strong coming back on trail. I decided to get back into the swing of things and do a 15 mile day. The terrain was almost totally dry in this section and only a few moderate climbs. Great trail to get back into it. The weather, trail, and views were amazing. I had a great time in town sprinkled with some starting trial magic and today just turned out excellent. I think today has been my favorite day on the trail yet. I've been hiking in a mini bubble of about 20 hikers and we're all getting to know each other well but since I did 15 I'm starting to break out of the group and am seeing new faces as I push on. Just for clarification this bubble is not hiking as a single group we just have similar pacing. Since it was a late start I rolled in to the shelter around 7:30 quickly setup and had dinner as the sun went down. As I was finishing eating, this massive group of 12 hikers rolled in from a 20 mile day. They're all in their early twenties and kind of loud and obnoxious. I've noticed people under 22 or so tend to try and form these massive hiking groups AKA trail families. I'm not a fan of hiking in large groups so I was happy to find out I'll be going 4 miles farther than them tomorrow and hopefully that should be enough to avoid them at least for the short term. I like small groups of like minded people, this group I could see was beginning to fracture already having different people upset over the longer mileage. Big groups just don't seem sustainable out here, too many decisions that have to be in sync. Oh I almost forgot, I hauled some trail magic for myself. I carried a 24 oz beverage with me to this shelter and may or may not have thoroughly enjoyed it. Sometimes you gotta make your own trail magic. I'm In my hammock ready for a potentially large day tomorrow to standing bear farm and an exit to SMNP. I look forward to not being bound by the shelters and able to do camping on my own again. Exiting the park will also spread us out a great a deal more than we are. I also won't be this high in elevation again until I'm standing on Mt. Washington. It's all down hill from here The weather and having to stay at shelters made things pretty busy through here. I'm excited to make some solid progress the next few days and make my way up to Hot Springs which many have told me is the greatest trail town on the AT. It will be the first time the trail actually goes through a community and becomes sidewalk for a brief period. Tomorrow may be an 18 mile day to get me out of the park. :0","New Found Gap (Gatlinburg)

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559918,"Day 23Standing Bear Farm 18.1Today was another great and productive day. Today I made it out of the Smokies. I started my day talking to Prism, she is hiking with her dog (except in the Smokies) and also made a comment how annoying that group is I mentioned last night so I'm glad I'm not the only one. We chatted for about 10 miles until she dropped off to meet her dog at the Smokies border, otherwise I hiked alone to music. Today was my longest day but not as hard as the mud days. Standing bear hostel is the most unique place I've been on trail for hikers. It's a simple bunkhouse and this open common area with a fire pit and a resupply store and kitchen. Everything is on the honor system including beer, you track your consumption of beer and resupply purchases on an envelope and you settle up the next day. I had a good time with Hunter, Horse, Dogfather(I need to write an entry devoted to this guy, he's by consensus the most interesting guy on the trail), and Mojito and Robin (the Baltimore couple) the group I just named has been my mini bubble and we've seen each other for almost 10 days in a row so we're on pretty good terms. I started with dog father and Hunter back at Hiker Hostel and we're here! This group is surprisingly diverse but we all get along well, the plan is to do the next 2.5 days together to hot springs. Aside from Hunter and I the rest of those lunatics did a 24 mile day together to get here in the name of beer and pizza. I can't blame them it's the same reason I did 18. I had a pizza and a 6 pack of PBR and a lot of good conversation. I've heard some pretty great town stories from this group so far.Tonight was fun and productive as it should be. I'm guessing tomorrow will be around 15, now that I'm not bound by shelters I have flexibility again! Im in my hammock next to the bunkhouse about to go to sleep. I didn't get to bed to write this until midnight because everyone was pretty chatty late into the night.","tri corner shelter

Luckily it was well worth it for the camp site at Max Patch. Leaving Standing Bear was hard in the morning, I had two microwave breakfast sandwiches some Mountain Dew and Gatorade before hitting the trail. The biggest issue was the heat and sun which made me need more water than expected and leaving late made things worse. When it's this hot I have to leave early and beat the direct sun. But again, all worth it for this campsite. Since there are no trees on Max Patch I had to dig my hammock tarp up with trekking poles and just use my foam pad for insulation. As I write this it doesn't seem too cold or windy so this setup should work for tonight but it's not nearly as comfortable as a hammock. Doesn't come close, and confirms I made the correct call using a hammock. Some of us hung four and chatted as we watched an amazing sunset and moonrise. I picked the sun rise side so I should get a great view from bed tomorrow. I mostly feel ok, tomorrow or the day after I'll be in hot springs NC where the trail physically goes through its first town. I'm thinking of just taking a Nero and waiting to take a day off.","Standing Bear Hostel

The hike had a few moderate climbs but it was mostly downhill to get to Hot Springs. Every 5-8 miles I took my shoes off to breathe my feet and it kept me going. My only mistake was usually at higher distances of 15+ I have some Anti chafing stuff and I forgot to put it on and I paid the price. I had some chaffing and foot pain the last few miles and hopefully everything heals up before I head out tomorrow evening. On my way down I saw two snakes, one rattled loudly on trail as I got too close. I immediately backed up about 15 feet grabbed two rocks and waited. Luckily before I had to throw them to get it to move on it left and moved uphill after a few minutes. Today was also very hot and in this type of heat I need to up my water consumption. I'm using a hat and bandanna combo and it seems to help keep a lot of sweat in and keep me cooler. So Hunter and I arrived in town behind Dogfather and horse who also stayed up at Max Patch the night before. Hunter and I split a hostel room at Elmers Hostel which is the oldest hostel on trail and hosted Earl Schafer the first thru Hiker. Inly 20 bucks a person! It's a very old And slightly run down building but it has a lot of charm and there is a ton of history here and Elmer is a legend of the AT, he seems to be picky about who stays there and he sort of interviewed me getting a room when I called. We showered and ran to the tavern and all of us ordered two dinners each and a few pitchers of beer. I was super lucky, sitting on the porch I was able to look inside and watch the penguins playoff game on the only TV in a bar in rural North Carolina. After eating I headed back and called it a night. I'm going to do laundry and figure out how much resupply I need until my next stop. Once I do that I'm going to head out late and climb out of here and sleep on the ridge 5-8 miles up top. I'm going to take it easy but I don't think I want to zero until Erwin 70 miles north. Most of the other guys are zeroing here tomorrow, Hunter may join me. I also bumped into some people ahead who I met in Fontana, which was nice to catch up on see them. Hot Springs is small but it's charming and has everything a hiker needs in a very small area.","Max Patch Bald

I did some laundry and had a massive lunch then bought my resupplies at the outfitter. I also received a package from the post office and mailed two small boxes of winter stuff home. I took my sweet time leaving town knowing I only had to do an 8.5 day so I left late knowing it would be cooler. I got to the site on the summit right as it was getting dark and only a few people are up here so I got a nice isolated campsite and am getting ready for bed. I can tell I'm getting stronger because I hardly felt like I did 20 miles yesterday and today the 8.5 was all uphill but I didn't feel weak or tired. Tomorrow, I'm only doing another 8-9 to get to another hostel because I may be taking a few days off for non trail related reasons. But I'm feeling really good so far in and I've been having a blast, everything is going really well so far!

I don't think I got moving until almost 11:30 which is late for a 14 mile day. It rained a early on but stayed mostly dry the rest of the day. Today was pretty rough physically speaking. My 4 zeroes had a toll and despite today being mostly flat I got my butt kicked a good bit. I hope I adjust quickly or it's going to take some time getting my trail legs back. Nearly the moment I got near the shelter it began pouring. I quickly got water and scouted a good hammock spot up trail a little. This was my first time setting up in heavy rain and I had to do setup a little differently but it seemed to work well. You have to get your tarp up first and create a dry space for yourself before you can do anything else. I skipped cooking since it was raining so much and I was tired. I relaxed on my hammock finishing up world war Z on audiobook. The Audiobook cut a lot out from the book which was odd some of my favorite stories were cut out. Anyways, today had some good views and easy trail but it kicked my butt so I hope tomorrow is easier. I'll try and get an earlier start tomorrow so I can go a little slower. I also just realized I have nearly five days of food and I'll be in Erwin in two days. Really need to work on that, I'm carrying nearly 8-10 pounds of food that I didnt need.","laurel shelter

As soon as I packed it began raining even harder so I decided today would be a short day. Today was mostly up and the trail was extremely muddy. Most hikers were blowing past me which is unusual. I'm still hiking pretty slowly and hills are kicking my butt. I think today was slightly easier so I hope my body is readjusting. As soon as I got to the shelter it began to rain again so I quickly set up got water and made dinner. I'm mostly dry and somewhat warm as I write this. My hammock strap wasn't properly snagged in the buckle and slipped and I hit the ground while I was texting my fiancée. Nothing is super wet but any warmth I had was gone as I had to run out in my dry clothes and fix my hammock. It was my fault it slipped, I didn't take the time to untangle the strap before I got on. Seeing all new faces and I haven't had the chance to even say hi to anyone since it's been raining so much. Tomorrow looks like more rain so I hope to get a dry period to pack up and head out tomorrow otherwise it will be a slow day again. Fortunately I have plenty of food. I had two dinners tonight to try and lighten my load a little. Today I listened to the Astonishing Legends podcast on the Mothman. I didn't realize most of the activity took place near Athens Ohio where I went to college. I enjoyed the podcast it's fun hearing about all the North American monsters and legends. Tomorrow I may listen to another few episodes or I may start book one of game of thrones. Hoping tomorrow is as least warmer than today.","Flint Mountain Shelter

My entire day was viewless and in the clouds except for when the trail went underneath a highway. Today has very challenging terrain and for a little I hiked with a man and his son thru hiking although they quickly burned me on the steeper uphills and I never saw them again. I'm camped now up against the trail in undesignated camping area by a stream. I wanted to camp as close to Erwin as possible so tomorrow will be a ten mile to Erwin for a resupply and possibly a rest at a motel or hostel. I've been to Erwin once before leaving Asheville to get food and it isn't much of a town but it should have everything I need. So I'm camped out all alone tonight which is a nice change. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow so the mud can dry out a bit. I slipped once today but I was unhurt and un muddied. I'm learning to fall backwards onto my pack as I go down and let go of my poles which seems to lessen the damage. Once I got to my camp I began setting up and a massive tree branch fell near me. We call those widow makers. I checked my direct area and feel pretty confident about my location. One unusual thing I did today was pass up trail magic because I wasn't in the mood for sodas and snacks. I think my recent bout of zeroes may have helped suppress my cravings. With all the fog the trail has had a spooky quality and it's been very pretty despite the wet mud and fog. My feet are pounding and the wet seems to have killed my insoles although I think I can get them to Demarcus before I need new ones and perhaps find a longer lasting solution. I seem to destroy insoles in wet conditions.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

I felt a lot better today and the terrain was a much lower grade so I made good time. I made it down to town and split a shuttle at uncle johnnys Hostel which is right on the trail. We went to the super 8 motel where many other hikers were staying and unlike uncle johnnys the hotel was much closer to town. I showered and immediately went to get dinner at huddle house around 4 which serves breakfast type food. I then walked to food lion which was over a mile walk each way. I then went back out grabbed a second diner around 8 at taco bell and grabbed some beer and hung out at the hotel and did laundry the rest of the night. My insoles died already so I replaced them with an athletic version of dr.shols, the gel ones which seemed to disintegrate after hiking in wet conditions aren't any good for hiking. I hope these new ones hold up or I'll have to upgrade and get something a bit longer lasting. After laundry I watched tv and organized my food and gear. I again bought way too much, I was shooting for 6 days but I think I have 7+. I'm trying to get to Kincora Hostel for my next resupply which is about 90 miles up trail. I bought the insoles separately because I forgot to get new ones on my first trip, and when I left the hotel to walk the half mile each way to Walgreens, two thru hikers offered me a ride...in their rented U-haul. They argued for 40 bucks a day they had a car and a hotel room to sleep out of the back of. They were an interesting pair to say the least but I was grateful for the ride.","Spivey Gap

I started by waking up in this awesome forest atop Roan Mountain  I hiked up to Roan Mountain summit and had a wonderful view for miles around with fog in the valleys. Then we went over 3 very cool Balds which reminded me a lot of dolly sods or Grayson Highlands. The hiking was strenuous but enjoyable. 
I hiked a little with puddle jumper and silver lining. I was pretty focused on making good time so I only passed by Over Mountain Shelter  without taking the side trail to it. I didn't have any reason to stop there but it's this famous shelter because it's on the path some revolutionary soldiers took to a battle and it's a shelter that's a barn which makes it one of a kind on the AT. I got some pictures of it from the hill climb out. My goal today was getting to the road and walking .2 miles down it to the B and B. 
Before I could there was a little magic from another hiker named Gandalf giving out beer and snacks. I drank a beer then did the road walk and checked into the hostel. I took a quick shower then hitch hiked 3 miles to a BBQ and burger joint. The food was amazing and Once back hung out with the hikers. I chatted with a father and son from Florida here to do a 3 day trip on what I did today. I respect that because this section is simply amazing hiking.

Today was the longest flattest section of trail yet. Easy ridge line walking with the occasional tiny climb or descent aside from the final few miles. So my plan was to carry extra water to the VA TN state line and camp there. Once I got there some other hikers who had started at the shelter with me peer pressured me into just going to remaining 3.5 miles into town. So I dumped my extra water and headed to town. Once in town I was nearing exhaustion as I had never hiked that far before but due to the easy terrain and the fact I was only carrying a day of food made my pack very light. I headed to subway, the last place open since it was 8:30 in a small town.

The rain itself isnt bad but its been pretty cold the last few days and rain plus cold is no fun. One or the other is a different story. So I hiked solo for most of my day catching up to doc and tinkle gunning for partnership Shelter because its near a road crossing to Marion. I split a ride into town, quickly resupplied at Walmart and headed back to hangout with some hikers at the shelter. Horse, Silver Lining, Dog Father, Two Socks, Pyro, and many others I havent seen in a few days were here. Since this shelter was nice and close to town and raining it basically become a fun hangout where we were all having a few beers and catching up. It was a blast and maybe too much fun. Some people here zeroed at this shelter yesterday to dry off and eat town food. I had a blast and managed to have some really good pizza which I have been craving for well over 100 miles. Now that I have 4 days of food I am ready to put some miles down and get to the next town 60 miles up. Today was a fun day, maybe too much fun.","

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564711,"Today was the Casual Mexican Marathon as coined by Horse. Leaving Partnership Shelter around 9 and behind Horse and Silver Lining I hiked a quick pace over easy terrain in the morning. The trail then become really pretty open meadows and farms. My Instagram has some good pictures of these. Near the bottom before the 81 crossing there was an old school house from the early 1800’s which was now being used to house trail magic for hikers. The school house had anything a hiker could possibly need inside. Things like toothbrushes, toilette paper, safety pins, and a lot of other things not to mention chips cold drinks and fruit and candy. I had two sodas and grabbed a few minor odds and ends. Shortly after this the trail goes underneath and overpass of I-81. On the corner of the road before the trail goes back to the woods there are two places to eat. Horse and Silver lining were already At the Mexican restaurant/ gas station. I quickly ate since they were finishing and we discussed doing a 26 mile day. (We had already hiked 12 miles). I considered and agreed. We grabbed a single beer each from the gas station and hauled on to the shelter 14 miles up. Horse decided the marathon had to be causal in pace and since we had Mexican it become the Casual Mexican Marathon day. I also bought them the beer and helped a few hikers out to get some Karma to help my chances of having the pens win that night in their series. We got in around 9 and I was too tired to cook so I had cheese and candy and went to bed around 11. I snuck a signal out and found out the pens had won which made me a very happy. Overall I was pretty tired and sore and got a few odd blisters. But I recovered enough for the next day…","

Rabbit Hole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564713,"Today I started out earlier than usual thanks to Horse and Silver Lining. I was out with them at 8 and I this time reluctantly agreed to a 20. We had a few decent hills with steep ascents which made today challenging and the trail was tough too due to it following the spine of a ridge where the rock sticks out of the mountain along its entire ridge. So flat terrain was rocky and we had lots of ups and downs in short. My feet hurt but I don’t think I received new injuries, so tomorrow Silver Lining and I are planning on a “rest” day doing only 13 miles. I had two dinners tonight since I skipped yesterday and may have for once eaten enough food. It started raining as soon as I pulled up to the shelter today and they’re calling for a lot of rain tomorrow. We shall see what the weather brings tomorrow, this seems to be the attitude of just about everyone’s plan for tomorrow. I again apologize to anyone who follows along for being periodically behind. Sometimes it’s signal issues sometimes I get a few days behind writing these since I do it at night before I pass out.","
