Journal for this hike will be for friends and family who want to track our progress, and we will try to update this site as often as we can. However, we both do not enjoy writing so bets are off about posting on a regular basis.Bullet Points--Our pack weight dialed in to about 17 lbs. base weight- meaning without food, water, and fuel.-We travel from Asheville to Georgia on March 13th to the Hiker HostelThe hostel will shuttle us to the Approach trail on the 15th where we will officially start.-We will be carrying 4 days of food at about 8 pounds (2 pounds per person per day).

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557213,"Hello Everybody!!!We started on March 15 at the approach trail and arrived at springer that evening for 15 degree weather with large wind chill all night. We started hiking immediately the next morning just to warm up - which took 2 hours. The day turned out really nice. Some highlights from the first few days:- flock of turkeys in the early morning, about 8 of them, and no shotgun. We got really close before they flew up the hill.-trail magic at unicoi gap with a carton of grapes and two old timers at tray gap with cookies and hot dogs and soda-other than the first day the weather has been really nice except for the rain last night. But, the tent works pretty well in the rain.We're still trying to get our trail legs. We're spending the night at Hiawassi, Ga. We will try to post pictures later today.

Since Hiawassee, we have been breaking our 8-10 mile rule and hiking up to 16 miles a day. The daily miles depends on the weather, terrain, and how my feet, knees, etc...hurt. But, we can definitely tell we are getting stronger. And we are getting better at what our pack should have and setting up and tearing down our campsite.We posted some photos, so please look on the left side for those. The past two days have been very foggy, so the views haven't been so good, but like HoboJoe says, they all look the same.We've hiked with a lot of different people, everyone is very nice. Even one who attended the Chewoki school in Maine. We will move through North Carolina for the next week and are looking forward to seeing some friends and family - and hopefully Jake. We miss him a lot!","Hiawassee, GA

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558227,"Hello Everybody!Still cranking out the miles. We stopped at Fontana Hilton Shelter close to Fontana Village Resort for a rest day to recuperate after some tough miles. Some highlights from our little adventure:-the Nantahala Outdoor Center was a pretty fun sight for hikers and a beautiful area to just relax; however, the climb out of the NOC was hard culminating in Jacob's Ladder- or straight up and steep.-new tent worked out nice and is much roomier than the last one. Our first time using it we pitched the tent on too steep an incline- the only tent site available- and we didn't sell sleep too good sliding down to the bottom of the tent every ten seconds.-we are becoming experts at sleeping in the rain, but packing up in the morning with everything wet still is a hard time.

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558736,"Hello once again. Hobojoe and I are in Gatlinburg. We left Fontana Dam after taking a zero (no hiking miles) day due to pain in my lower leg. After a day of rest and some KT tape that another hiker gave me, we took off for a 17 mile day. The hike wasn't bad after the 4 mile uphill out of Fontana Dam. Leaving Fontana Dam put us in the Great Smokey Mountains which have been very nice despite the rules of having to sleep in the shelter unless it is full. So far, we haven't had to due to the amount of people hiking. The weather was awesome until the last day heading in to Gatlinburg. We left camp early to beat the rain, but no luck. The last 4 miles it was a downpour, but lucky for us, my sister was there to pick us up. We have taken a day off to resupply and enjoy the family and head back tomorrow. Next stop is Hot Springs and we'll hopefully get to see some more family. I posted photos, but some are having issues. The only thing I can think of is to hit the link titled ""last"" below the photos, then the link ""previous"" when looking at the photos.","Fontana Dam

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559943,"Hello everyone from Hot Springs. We left Gatlinburg after a 5 day stay - we were only going to stay for a day and a half. Due to the weather - rain, cold, then snow and the road being closed, we stayed a few days more than anticipated. We finally left despite the trail being frozen (see photos)and by the time we got to the shelter, we were cold and just wanted to get the tent up and get warm. But, what a difference a day makes - the next day it warmed up and we went downhill past the snow and slush.Right past the northern boundary of the Great Smokey Mountains, we stayed at the Standing Bear Hostel for a night which was nice since we did laundry, had a few beers, and a shower (at least I did just to get the salt off from the sweat). After we left there, we hiked for another day and a half, passed Max Patch (see photos), and into Hot Springs. We got there earlier than anticipated since HoboJoe likes to do 18 mile days now. It worked out, since his parents came in with a resupply and we got to enjoy lunch with them. And today, his friends come in for a visit/hike. We'll take off tomorrow with a goal of Erwin in 4 to 5 days. Hopefully, we can post again.","Gatlinburg

Thank you to my parent for visiting, Thomas and Annie and the kids for also seeing us. And, thank you to Aaron and Joy for visiting us in Erwin and bringing Jake to see us. Joy has now totally assimilated Jake into their household, and I think he's her dog right now. We zipped through Hot Springs to Erwin in 4 days and then Erwin to Hampton in 3 days. We put in a 22 miler and a 25 miler; so, we're getting a little better- feet still hurt at the end of the day.The bald mountains in NC and TN are hard to hike up (picture will be posted once we get to Damascus, VA in 3 days), but the views are incredible. We've seen two garter snakes and a rustled up a few deer drinking off of the Elk River in TN.The rain right now in Hampton is bordering on 2-4 inches, and we're glad were inside avoiding the weather. Lots of cold, wet hikers right now. We will write again in Damascus.Thank you again everyone for your support.","NONE- Rest Day

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562984,"Hello everyone.  We apologize for not posting sooner, but we both got a severe virus in Damascus, VA and we didn't feel like doing anything.  Luckily, it hit the night we went in to Damascus, so it could have been worse if we were out on the trail.  I got it first and then a day later, HoboJoe got it.  It set us back two days, but we are both feeling better.Once we got moving, we finally past our 500 mile marker.  I posted some pictures of the ponies from the Grayson State Park.  That was really nice.  The terrain in Virginia has been a little easier  (so far) compared to Georgia and North Carolina.  You can definitely see a difference in the vegetation - everything is budding and turning green - it is really pretty.  We should post in about 5 days or so.  Most places (hostels) don't have a computer for hikers to use, so it can be difficult to post.  Again, thank you to everyone for their support.  ","Damascus

I  posted some photos of some well-known locations like Dragon's Tooth,  Tinder Cliffs, and Mcafee Knob. The keffer Oak is the largest in the south on the AT and is approximately 300 years old.

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566140,"Hello Everybody!
We finally arrived in Waynesboro, VA near the Shenandoah National Forest where we did all our practice hikes.  It's good to be back in familiar terrain and out of the rain.  Let's talk about the rain.  We spent 4 of the last 8 nights in all night downpours.  Our tent has held up fine, but we have to wipe off the inside every two hours or so because the condensation from our breath makes in inside wall wet--- add a steady downpour and that condensation mists on to everything inside if you don't wipe it down.

The trail has been wet and dangerously slick and slippery in this weather.  Kim got a new pair of shoes; so, she's not slipping as much.  My new pair are too slippery on the slick granite rocks.  I've had too many close calls and am nervous about injury.  You can't test out slick in rainy conditions in the shoe department.

We stayed at a free park area in Glasgow, VA where we had an great Italian dinner and came back to our tent sitting in four inches of water.  Nothing got wet, however.  We dodged one on that.  The dinosaur pictures are from that town.  

Overall, we are doing great and enjoying walking.  The rain gets old but we can manage if we keep our dry clothes that we sleep in dry.  We still have not slept in a shelter on this trip, and plan to keep it that way until  the whites in NH where they make you for large sums of money. 

We are very happy for our Aunt Caroline and Uncle George for selling their house in ME.  We wish we were there to help them out in their move.  I do not envy all the work they have to do between now and the moving into a new house.  We wish them luck, and they have helped us out so much with storage, paperwork, and encouragement during our excursion.  Tell Lila we have met two more Cherwonki camp counselors that are thru hiking with us.  Lots of positive energy from them.

Waynesboro is a great town and we look forward to going through SNF with all the waysides and campstores.  Aaron tell your oldest there's a great fly fishing store here in the downtown section.  We'll try to write again in Front Royal, VA.","

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567244,"Hey Everybody!  We just finished the SNF where we had trained while we lived in Richmond.  We took our time and really enjoyed all the sights and sounds.  We tried to relive our practice hikes, but we're going much faster now- everything looks the same.  We avoided rain the whole time and got to eat at all the restaurants (called waysides) throughout the national forest.  We also took advantage of two of the campgrounds in order to shower and do our laundry - much needed for both.  We were fortunate to see some of the wildlife - We got to see a mother bear pull a cub down off a tree after we startled the cub while going to a water source. We also ran across and fought a copperhead snake a little until we finally went around it, and we got to see a newly born fawn who could barely walk- the mother deer was licking it clean as we walked past.  SNF has not had sanctioned hunting in 80 years; so, deer and bears and critters don't really care about us humans walking through. Anyway, we are done with the Shenandoah NF.  We got a surprise call from Chris in FL yesterday.  It was great talking to you, and someday we'll be living in your yard which you're working so hard to pay off.  Next stop is Harper's Ferry, WV.  We don't know if we'll stay or not, but we have some packages to pick up - thanks to George!!  Again, thanks to everyone for their support.","

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568707,"Hello Everybody, 
We are currently resting in the small town of Duncannon, PA.  We're going to head out into the rocky terrain today, and we'll be in the rocks here for the next ten days.
Here are some highlights from the last few days:
- the parks along the trail in Maryland were incredible.  We got some much needed trail magic from Ernie and his family.  See pics.
-in Pennsylvania, we got to enjoy lunch at several waysides or parks that included a concession stand or store or lake/pool.  The little stops make the hot afternoons tolerable.
-The towns of Boiling Springs, PA and Harper's Ferry, WV were very nice, and we like to visit them again
- And, we're half way done on the mileage and three months into the walk

Thanks and hello to everyone

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571115,"Hello Everybody,It's been a while since we've been able to post due to not being around a lot of towns with a library!!!  We're not very good at posting with a cell phone.  We have been through a bunch of states during the posting break-  PA, NJ, NY, and CT. The rocks in PA, NJ, and NY kicked our butts and tore up our feet and shoes.  They really have slowed us down.  We were expecting the rocks in PA, but were disappointed when they continued in NJ.  We have been to a lot of great delis in the NY/NJ area; we don't have to pack out as much food which is less weight to carry.  The cold cut sandwiches are always awesome.  Beats the heck out of Subway!There have been lots of state parks that we've walked through, and it's good to see people using the parks and trails that they live near.  Of course, the parks have concession stands that we take advantage of.  The Bear Mountain State Park is the lowest point on the AT - it was through a zoo that we had to walk through which was a good change of scenery.We've seen lots of snakes- Kim almost stepped on a rattle snake until he kindly gave a warning.  She jumped back about 40 feet, caught her breath, and walked around.  Throughout the past few states, we've seen lots of bears, frogs, toads, and have heard a lot of coyotes and owls at night.Everything is going ok.  We are two thirds complete and are trying to stay focused.  Our next posting depends on the resources available.  Again, thank you for your support!","

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572524,"Hello Everybody!  We are taking a little break in the town of Bennington, VA.  We are now hiking on the Vermont Long trail which shares its space with the AT.  In Vermont it is super muddy, and until you see the mud you can't believe how much mud there is on one trail.  We have been to some great stops in the current stretch of trail.  Here are a few highlights:-we took two days off in Great Barrington, MA due to crappy weather.  -the terrain is starting to get steep again; that will hopefully prepare us for the two hardest states, New Hampshire and Maine.-Mount Greylock, the highest peak in MA, had a great breakfast cafe on the summit. You will notice the Veterans Memorial in the pictures.-In Dalton, MA we camped in the yard of a retired guy, Tom, who lets hikers stay for free; he also drove us to a sporting goods store where we got some much needed new shorts.Sorry the trail entries are getting lame, or have been lame, because we're starting to get into towns where there is not library access.  We going to have to slow down when we get to NH due to the super high mountains.  Our guess is that we have six to seven weeks left on the hike.  Again, thank you all for the support!","

hobojoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573195,"Hello Everybody!
We stopped in Rutland, VT for a quick resupply.  We have been hiking in Vermont's Long Trail which follows the AT through the first 100 miles of the state.  Next for us is New Hampshire and the huge mountains.  We look forward to them, but also are pretty nervous about how hard it's going to be for the next two or three weeks.  The AT saves the best for last, and NH and ME are definitely going to be the hardest states of the trail.

No real highlights, other than VT is very, very muddy.  The temperatures dropped to the low 50's over several nights.  Hiking in temperate weather sure is nice.

We'll try to update somewhere in NH.  Wish us luck, and thank you all for the support.","
