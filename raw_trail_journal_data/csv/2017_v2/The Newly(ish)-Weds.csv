The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567702,Hi All! Logan and Alyssa here (aka Braveheart and Squeeks). Welcome to our trail journal! We're happy to have you along for the hike and look forward to sharing our experiences with you. We're still here in civilization soaking up all of the showers and Netflix that we can before heading north to head south!,,View Entry,"Jun 05, Mon",0

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568704,"Today is the day we fill our packs with everything we will need for the next 5 months. Our loving and helpful and AWESOME families are stashing the rest of our belongings for us while we hike. We weren't sure if it would all fit in our packs...but it did! Our packs each weigh approximately 40lbs. This is the heaviest our packs will ever weigh as we have to carry 10 days worth of food to get us through the 100 Mile Wilderness (normally we should only have to carry around 5 days worth of food). You probably can't see it, but there are 22 Snickers in that picture - BRING ON THE PROTEIN!",,View Entry,"Jun 13, Tue",0
The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568710,"Today was a hard day....it was the day we left our families and friends behind. The trip is becoming very real. We have planned this for over 2 years and it's finally happening! We caught a Megabus out of Philly  up to Boston at 10:55 tonight. About 2 hrs into our trip the driver made an announcement that the George Washington Bridge was closed due to a fatal car accident, meaning we'd have to drive through downtown Manhattan. This detour added 2 hrs to our trip. Thankfully we have a 4.5 hr layover. Our prayers are with the families that were involved in the accident. As we prepare to depart Boston for Maine, we can't thank our families/friends enough for all of the support. We love you guys!",,View Entry,"Jun 14, Wed",0
The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568736,"Today is the final leg of our trip up to Baxter State Park from Pennsylvania! The Megabus ride was long last night. Thankfully we were both able to get a little bit of rest. After getting into Boston, we had about 2 hrs to kill, so we ran over to Starbucks for breakfast. We spent the rest of the day in a Greyhound bus that dropped us off in Bangor, ME. We then received a private shuttle for the remaining 2 hrs of our trip into Baxter State Park. Tomorrow day #1 on our journey together over the next 5 months. We couldn't be more excited and grateful to have this opportunity together.",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Thu",0
The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570439,"We're glad today is out of the way! We really hit the ground running, and got quite a raw introduction to the Appalachian Trail! Not sure what words would be best to describe our day...""scary,"" ""windy,"" and ""ice-storm conditions"" might be a few. We hiked for 2 miles in the woods until we hit the tree line, and the rest of the hike included bouldering and rock-hopping above tree line. Once we were out of tree cover, the wind and rain really started to pick up. It got to the point where the rain felt like hail pelting our faces. When we had been pulling ourselves over boulders for two hours, and realized that we still had 2 miles to go, I (Squeeks) began to lose hope and break down in the middle of the scary, wintery conditions. All of our layers of clothing were soaked through, and we were getting colder by the minute. In spite of the weather and my tears, Braveheart kept up his jolly spirit and guided us courageously to the summit, reassuring me over and over that we were going to be okay. (His name really does fit!) When we eventually reached the top, we were rewarded for all of our hard work with a beautiful, panoramic view of a blanket of white fog. Because of the crazy wind, rain, and chilly temperatures, we spent less than five minutes at the summit...enough to snap a few non-clear photos before we began our decent back down to our campsite. When we returned to camp, we changed into our dry camp clothes and called it a night. So glad that our big Day One is out of the way, and incredibly thankful for the safety that God provided us with. Now on to the 100-Mile-Wilderness!","Katahdin Stream Campground

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570440,"Today was a nice, flat-ish day that included many bogs and bog bridges. We left camp around 9ish with our final destination for the day being the 100-Mile-Wilderness! This section of the AT is exactly what it sounds like...100 miles of trees, with no towns to stop in or resupply at. On our trek to the Wilderness, we were greeted by the 2nd Mosquito Brigade out of Millinocket, Maine (a.k.a. the Eleventh Plague). I (Braveheart) suffered many wounds at the hands of these little demons...approximately 73, but who's counting? The first half of the Wilderness is relatively flat and uneventful, aside from bogs, mud, tree roots, and what feels like the entire mosquito/black fly population on the Eastern Seaboard. When we arrived at our shelter/campsite for that night, we met approximately 10 fellow thru-hikers, and spent the night eating and chatting with them. With our bellies full of instant mac-n-cheese and our hearts full from forging friendships that only come from sharing the same kind of crazy, adventurous goal of walking 2200 miles, we decided that our first day in the Wilderness was pretty good, after all.","Katahdin Stream Campground

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570444,"Not too much has happened since our last post. We have been hiking/camping with our ""trail family"" for several days, and today was the day we climbed White Cap, our first ""big"" mountain after Katahdin. What a blessing it is to have other people to help boost our morale and spirits as we continue our journey. The 100-Mile-Wilderness has been physically, mentally, and emotionally draining, and today was no exception. The wonderful company of our fellow hikers helped us get up that mountain. And what a great veiw we had from the top! On another note...WE SAW A MOOSE yesterday!!It scuttled away before Braveheart could get his camera out. It was a baby moose that was on the edge of a lake. As soon as our group got close, it ventured into the tall brush surrounding the lake and disappeared from sight. We're about three quarters of the way done with the wilderness and are ready for a burger in town (and as much fruits/veggies as we can get our hands on!)","East Branch Lean-to

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570449,"We survived!!!!! We started our day with the smell of pizza, burgers, and beer blowing from Monson...or maybe it was just our imagination. After 10 days of 90% of our conversations revolving around food, we were finally rewarded after our three mile hike from where we slept to the end of the wilderness. Upon reaching the road to civilization, our trail friends Lazy Tongue (Jay) and Root (Ash) got engaged! We hiked all of the wilderness with them and Root's brother Cutie (Dave). The 100-Mile-Wilderness definitely lived up to it's infamous reputation...it pushed us to our limits physically, emotionally, and mentally, and made us stronger as individuals and as a married couple. Now for a well-deserved zero day...complete with town food and beer!","Leeman Brook Lean-to

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570450,"Our journey on the trail is taking a pause for now. We are so very glad we fought our way through the 100-Mile-Wilderness, but we also learned that thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail can be especially difficult as a married couple. Many days, we felt as if we were robots, devoting 10 hours of our day to hiking (during which, conversation can be limited due to being out of breath, carrying sound-absorbing packs on our back, and fending off swarms of mosquitoes), only to arrive at camp, find a tent site, assemble our tent, set up our belongings in the tent, filter several liters of water, cook dinner, chat for a bit with other hikers, check for ticks, and read a few pages of a book together on our Kindle before passing out in our sleeping bags, only to do it all over again the next morning. We realized in Monson that this is not a sustainable pattern. So we decided, after many long conversations and much prayer, to take a two-week break with family so that we can re-group, pray, and re-evaluate how we want to proceed with our hike. We both have a fire in us to finish this adventure we've been dreaming of for years, but we also want to make sure we're doing it in a way that's healthy for our marriage and our emotions as individuals. We would like to begin hiking smaller distances, to allow for more time to stop and smell the roses (and see the sights) each day. I (Squeeks) have also been dealing with a mysterious ankle injury, which I'll be seeing a doctor for next week. We're hoping that the time off will be helpful in this regard, and will allow my ankle (and both of our knees and bug bites) to recover. In the meantime, we'll be enjoying time with both of our families, including a beach vacation, and an opportunity to celebrate the wedding of two of our dear friends. We would love it if you could join us these next two weeks in praying with us as we rest, recuperate, revel in time with family, and re-evaluate with hopes of getting back on the trail.","

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572597,"We're currently heading back up to Maine to resume our hike, statting from the place we left off (Monson). Arriving at the decision to continue hiking south took us a full two weeks...it was just difficult because, although it's been our dream for several years, we had to really think through the concerns we wrote about on our last post, to make sure that we're doing what's best for us and our marriage. We wanted to make sure this is how we want to spend the next five months together. We've decided to come back up and see where the trail takes us. On the inside of our wedding bands is the phrase, ""walking the trail of life,"" which is how we want to approach this experience. As of now, we're planning on heading to Georgia on the Appalachian Trail, but if our trail leads somewhere else (hiking elsewhere on the AT, or another adventure altogether), that's okay too. We have five months set aside, and we want to use them to grow in our relationship with God and each other. For now, we're heading to Stratton, the next major town on the AT, with intentions of pushing further.","

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576189,"Day one pushing out of Monson was fantastic! We had smooth terrain, without rocks, roots, or mosquitoes (for once!), and it was so refreshing! But we knew that the bliss wouldn’t last forever as we pushed further south and began to hit more mountains, and the climbs definitely delivered the promised challenges. Days two and three after Monson were much more difficult. Moxi Bald Mountain and Pleasant Pond Mountain were our big climbs those days, and the views were beautiful! The climbs up and down, however, were difficult. My (Squeeks) ankle began to bother me again, my feet were aching, and my knee began to twinge painfully. Braveheart’s shins and feet were in increasingly severe pain, and by the time we reached a town called Caratunk (which the trail passes straight through) at the end of day three, we knew we had to re-evaluate things. For the rest of southern Maine and through the White Mountains in New Hampshire, the mountain ranges become more and more intense…which is not good news for our injuries. To add to the mix, the weather forecast has been telling us horrible tales of days of rain to come in the next week. Rain + steep mountains + injuries = not good. We made the tough decision to head back to Pennsylvania, and hike the AT through our home state. The terrain is much less mountainous there, and there’ll be the added benefit of having both of our families close by in case our injuries force us to get off of the trail. We’re going to hike north through PA, as far as we are able/as far as we are still enjoying life…if we get back to Caratunk this year, that’s great! If not, we’ll section hike the trail, and make our way back up there eventually! Here’s to trying a new approach to the trail!","

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576190,"We’re back on the trail in PA, and loving it! Our injuries have been feeling much better, which is very good news. Being able to hike without quite as much pain, and without the fear of permanent damage to our bodies, brings the joy back to the sport! We started a few miles into Maryland, and have thus far hiked up to Pennsylvania. Home, sweet home! We’ve met some fantastic people…a man section hiking with his sweet beagle Daisy, a father and his 10-year old son backpacking together for the first time (both with bare feet!), and several other wonderful people of all ages. It’s definitely much hotter hiking down here than it was in Maine, but nothing we can’t handle. We are both so very thankful for the opportunity to be out here in the woods, enjoying the woods and the company of each other. We’re still not sure how far north we’ll get or where the journey will take us, but we’re taking it day by day, enjoying our experiences along the way.","Weaverton Cliffs, Maryland

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576192,"We’ve been really liking the shelters here in Maryland and southern Pennsylvania! We’re so thankful for the caretakers and maintainers of the shelters and the trail itself so that all of us can enjoy the outdoors on the beautiful Appalachian Trail. The shelter in this picture was actually two shelters…one “snoring” section, and one “non-snoring” section! (On account of Braveheart’s less-than-quiet sleeping habits, we slept in the “snoring” section…also because we thought it was hilarious, even though there was no one else in either shelter that night.) We were able to meet the caretaker of this shelter, and he was so kind and helpful with information he gave us about the parts of the AT that were coming up for us. The days are hard work, full of long miles that (sometimes) seem like they’ll never end, but somehow, they always do end. And then we get to spend the evenings together, enjoying dinner, hanging out in the woods, and being goofballs together. We’re excited to continue north…in a few days, we’ll be hiking near Braveheart’s family, and we’ll get to stay with them!","Pennsylvania

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576193,"We’re beginning to experience the benefits of hiking through the state where so many of our dear friends and family are…after spending a night with Braveheart’s parents in their home over the weekend (so much fun, laughter, and yummy food!), we were able to spend another night this week with two of our wonderful friends. Tyson and Hannah graciously opened their home, and after picking us smelly hikers up from the trail, grilled us delicious burgers, and even treated us to ice cream. What a great night! The next day, they dropped us back off on the trail to continue hiking. Later in the week, we were able to stay with Logan’s uncle in his cabin. We had delicious food, and had such a wonderful night catching up with him. Real beds, showers, wonderful food, family, and friends…living in the woods has brought a newer and deeper appreciation for these things! We were so humbled by the generosity of our family and friends, who have loved us and supported us in such practical, basic ways this week. What a blessing it is to have these people in our lives!","Pennsylvania

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576194,"Our daily miles have been increasing lately, and we’ve both definitely felt it! We started this leg of our journey at around 12-13 miles a day, but have been boosting our distances each day, so that if we decide to continue up to Maine, we can get there before it gets too cold. Views like this one are our sweet rewards for all the hard work we push through every day, but the stress of increasing mileage is taking its toll. Many days, we feel like we’re back in Maine, getting to shelters later in the evening, racing through camp chores, and going to bed, without time to relax and unwind before having to get up the next morning and do it all over again. The bigger miles have required us to really limit our breaks during the day, which sometimes means less time to stop and smell the roses. Increasing our daily distance has also meant that instead of a refreshing hike, we often feel like we’re racing the clock, frequently having to check the time and push our bodies to go faster and get more miles in. Sometimes, when late afternoon comes, and the sun starts dipping lower, and we still have many more miles to hike before we finish for the day, it becomes easy to despair, especially when our knee, shin, or foot injuries start to act up because of the increased miles. But we’ve seen God’s grace and sustaining power in action here on the trail during these times. Every time we think that we’ll never be able to finish the day, that there’s no way we have enough energy to walk another step, that our legs are just too tired to be able to carry us over another boulder field, somehow, it always happens. When we’ve reached the end of our own resources, and are practically falling to our knees with exhaustion, God shows up in new ways. Whether in the forms of suddenly renewed energy, gentle and encouraging words from one of us to the other (usually from Braveheart to Squeeks), beautiful views and glimpses of wildlife when we need it the most, or irresistible laughter at the irony of trudging through a stream that is (supposed to be) the dry dirt path of the AT during a torrential downpour in what is (supposed to be) the driest state on the AT, we have experienced so many sweet tastes of God’s sustaining grace during our weakest moments. And we have so many things to be thankful for…plentiful water in springs and streams throughout PA, where it is usually hard to find water, shelters to stay dry in during thunderstorms at night, protection from two poisonous snakes we’ve almost stepped on, family and friends who have taken us in, friends who meet us on the trail just to say ‘hi’ and give us delicious leftover food (shoutout to our awesome friends Melissa and Kyle—thank you so much!). We’re still taking this journey one day at a time, enjoying the ‘now,’ and trusting in God to direct us and sustain us throughout this adventure.","Pennsylvania

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576196,"When you can have pizza in the middle of the woods, you know it’s a good day! After staying with Squeeks’ family over the weekend (and enjoying campfires, beer, motorcycle rides with Squeeks’ dad, and an awesome church service where Squeeks’ sister was baptized), we spent last night at the 501 shelter, which was right next to the house of the shelter caretaker, meaning it was close to a road. Which also means (more importantly) that you can order pizza to be delivered straight to the shelter! Needless to say, we felt it would be wrong not to take advantage of this delicious opportunity. Our full and complete hiker appetite hasn’t set in quite yet, so we weren’t able to finish all of the food we ordered. So we packed it out with us today, and were able to enjoy a cheesy leftover picnic in the woods for lunch! Better than protein bars, that’s all we have to say. It’s been pretty rainy, foggy, and depressing-looking in the woods these past two days, so we’ll take any pick-me-up we can get out here! Food is an excellent motivator on the trail: “4 more miles, and we get to have skittles and leftover pizza!” Works like a charm. The weather is supposed to improve as this week goes on, so hopefully we’ll get some sunshine back, to help dry us out, perk us up, and get the birds to chirp again!","501 Shelter

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576197,"We hiked to the Pinnacle today! Touted as Pennsylvania’s best view on the AT, it offers sights of mountains and valleys near Port Clinton and Hamburg. We enjoyed our morning snack (aka “second breakfast,” not to be confused with breakfast, lunch, “second lunch” or “first dinner”) in the shade of some trees on top of the Pinnacle. It was another day that mixed beautiful views with emotionally and mentally challenging hiking. We stumbled into camp later in the evening, after pushing through another day full of boulders, cantaloupe-sized rock fields, breaks that always felt too short, and sore feet and ankles. With all of that said, though, it was such a beautiful triumph to finally reach our shelter at the end of the day! We walked up to the shelter overcome with over-the-top enthusiasm, probably scaring any squirrels, chipmunks, deer or other wildlife within earshot.
After several weeks of hiking through PA and discussing the future of this journey, we’ve come to the decision that we’re going to stop hiking north at the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border. We’re both enjoying the opportunity for an extended backpacking trip, but with Braveheart starting school again in January, we’re realizing that having a few months to breathe and adjust to life in upstate New York before he begins classes would be very valuable. If we thru-hike, we’ll have less than a month to find an apartment, get another car, and get settled, and this would be over the Christmas season, which isn’t exactly the calmest time of year. Besides this, as our stress level has increased in proportion with our daily mileage, we’ve realized that our enjoyment of the trail often decreases.  The “get up, get packed, and go, go go!” mentality makes it difficult to stop, smell the roses, and enjoy the views. The solution? Cherry-pick the parts of the trail we want to section-hike this summer, and leave the rest for future trips! We’re going to be taking about a week and a half off, to give our bodies time to recover from the rocks and boulders after we finish PA, and head down to Virginia to backpack the AT for a few more weeks before we move in early October. We have pursued this dream for all its worth this summer, giving it our very best, and have learned a lot, grown a lot, and become closer in our relationships with each other and with God. At this point, although we’re sad about not being able to thu-hike (at this time in our lives, at least!), we feel at-peace about our decision. To our friends and family who have encouraged us, given us unconditional support, and cheered us on through this journey, thank you! God has used you tremendously in our lives. Now, for the rest of PA, and then on to Virginia! Bring on the Shenandoahs, Wayside food stops, Three Ridges, and more!","Windsor Furnace Shelter

The Newly(ish)-Weds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576198,"We finished our home state of Pennsylvania today! After 220 miles of lots of rain, ridge hiking, and some beautiful views, we’ve conquered this rocky beast! It’s been so absolutely cool to see what God has created our bodies to be able to do when we push ourselves. We’ve been kept safe through thunderstorms, snakes, and rocks, and have experienced so many blessings along the way. One of the highlights of this whole state, though, came when we only had a mile and a half left of it to hike…we were able to meet up with our dear friends who battled the 100-Mile-Wilderness with us! Ash, Jay, and Dave had no idea that we had left the trail in Maine and had started hiking north through PA. But they post frequently about their journey on Facebook, so we knew where they were, and we were estimating that we might run into them in northern PA or sometime in Jersey…but this was before we decided to get off the trail when we finished PA. When we made the decision to end in PA, we weren’t sure if we’d see them again. On our second-to-last day, though, we received word from other southbound thru-hikers that they were six miles behind, staying at a church hostel in Delaware Water Gap. We realized that we would without a doubt see them the next morning! The next day, we hightailed it out of camp so that we could try to surprise them in town. Sure enough, when we reached the town and walked into the hostel, they were there! We had an awesome morning catching up, reminiscing, laughing, and swapping stories. They had to leave, because they were just getting started hiking south through PA and had a long day ahead, but we had only a few more miles before we were done with PA. We spent the day in Delaware Water Gap, and hiked the rest of the way to the border in the evening, in time for Squeeks’ dad to pick us up. To top our day off, we happened to cross the border the same time that another one of our 100-Mile-Wilderness friends was approaching from the north! We hadn’t heard from Gandalf (Calvin) in about two months, and it was such a joy to end our PA section of the hike with so many reunions! We’re so grateful for all of the experiences—both fun and challenging, good and bad—that we have been able to experience so far! And we’re pumped for the next leg of our journey in Virginia. Now, it’s time for some rest for our bodies and relaxing with family.","Pennsylvania
