Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553343,"This afternoon we and 6 friends got together to pack up trail snacks to include in out mail drops. We plan to have breakfast and dinner, filling in with snacks every two hours to keep our energy up. Thus,we calculated for the two of us we need for a total of 1800 350-450 calorie snacks for the trip. Since we intend to do about half of out food through mail drops, this got us down to 900 pre-packed snacks.    Mary spent yesterday and this morning organizing most every container in the house to be filled with various snack mixes, combining our home-dehydrated products with others we had purchased. We had no idea how far this would go, but we used somewhere north of 700 small zip-loc bags, so I think we have made a really good start.  The packing was all done within a couple of hours, which was quite impressive given the volume of food involved. We then retired to the living room for a fine meal. A good time was had by all, and I really feel like we have a fine community of support for this venture.Two weeks from today, we plan another gathering to finish the snacks and start on breakfasts and dinners.

Puppydog out for a tromp on the Warner Creek Pathway today. Single digits, sunny and an impossibly blue sky. It was a surprisingly difficult 3.6 miles. I'm glad we're not doing the AT on show shoes. Having done a couple of dry-run pack-ups, I believe my (Loki) base weight pack is slightly over 24 pounds from skin out. Add about 10 pounds of food and water, and that's what I'm likely to be carrying. Berries is slightly less. We would have liked to be a little lighter, but I think we can work with it. As I am typing this, Berries is downstairs packing up mail drops. We were astounded to find that they add up to about 350 pounds of food. Also somewhat amazed at what the cost for postage would amount to. On the other hand, it will be nice to have some packages of homemade food. I highly recommend the book ""Recipes for Adventure"". It's written by a professional chef with a propensity for playing outside, and specifically targeted toward those with a dehydrator at home. It has some great ideas for giving trail meals that provide variety and interest.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Wed",0

We will drive to Grand Rapids, where my son lives, tomorrow and stay the night. Sunday, my son will drive us to Michigan City Indiana where we can catch a commuter train into Chicago. We travel overnight on the train to DC, where we have a layover of several hours. We then proceed to Gainesville, GA and on to our hostel to spend another night. On Wednesday the 22nd, we finally step out on the trail. At least that is the intent. I ended up taking a 40 hour class this week on short notice, which left Berries to do much of the last minute home prep. We will miss our home and our dog, but we're also excited to begin. I can only really get my mind around the first leg, so I'm just focusing on the trip from Springer to Neels Gap. I'll think about the next leg after that. Thanks to all our supporters out there, and all hail the Remote Medicine for the Advanced Provider folks!~LokiLast weekend some friends hosted a happy trails dinner with heavy and fresh foods we will not eat as frequently on the trail, and gave us a small watermelon--I figured it fit very nicely on HIS pack, as you can see in the photo.

Every single person brought something worthy to the table. On Monday morning, it felt like I was in a room full of strangers (other than my fellow Emmet County staff). By Friday afternoon, I felt like I had some new family members.If I was wading into an ugly rescue situation in a remote location, I could not ask for a better group of people beside me than the students of this class.

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557887,"We now finally have an opportunity to update the trail journal. Last night was our first town night off the trail. It was a little surprising to me how frenetic a town night can be. By the time we got into town, got a room, showered, did laundry, and did some serious damage to the local AYCE (all you can eat) buffet, it was nearly hiker midnight (9 pm to non-hikers).We've been on the trail for 6 days and covered a little over 50 miles. The trail has been rugged and steep in places, but eminently doable. If we can do it bipedally without ropes, we'll get there. Our mileage has been pretty humble, but we have been trying hard to start out easy until we get our trail legs. The weather has been overall cool and cloudy, with some thunderstorms. The one night that it came down hard, we were in a shelter. Actually that night we came in after dark and found the shelter full, but the folks were kind enough to move over and make room. We have a new family out there. We have encountered some really incredible trail magic. At Gooch Gap there was a group with a remote kitchen setup serving breakfast and hot drinks. Another gentleman was handing out sandwiches and sodas at Woody Gap. And perhaps finest of all, 2016 through hikers Doc and Sacajawea were distributing beer, gatorade and snacks at the trailside just outside of Neels Gap. Out deepest gratitude to all!!!At Low Gap Shelter, we were blessed with the presence of two bagpipers who provided music and entertainment. Overall, I feel we are off to a good start. It has been said that if you can hike out of Georgia you can hike the entire AT. We have a little less than 30 miles to the border. We have no foot or joint issues thus far, feeling pretty strong. Not everyone we have encountered has been so fortunate. I think we'll make it at least to the border. Our intent is to catch the 1100 shuttle back to Unicoi Gap and get some more miles in before dark. Hopefully it won't rain too hard. But even if it does, the worst day on the trail is still better than the best day working in the ED. WWMD?Loki","Springer Mountain

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558423,"We crossed from GA to NC yesterday, and passed the 100 mile mark today. Word from a previous hostel was that 25% or so who started at Springer Mountain have already dropped off. I guess we must just have better pain tolerance. We've been pretty lucky with the weather. We missed a major storm the night before we hit the trail. It rained hard one night when we were staying in a shelter, and Thursday night we had a very impressive thunderstorm after we were in the tent for the night. Most of the time on the trail it's been cloudy and 60s, nice for walking. Today, though, it was in the mid 70s with a serious sun beating down. We both got minor sunburn before it occurred to us to break out the sunscreen.Berries has a bit of a cold, and we are staying in a hostel tonight and possibly tomorrow night. The hostel appears to be run by the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. I am currently lying on a bunk made of pallets nailed together, in a 10x12 room with 6 other people in it. It's palatial in comparison to our tent though, and everyone is extremely friendly and welcoming. Any AT hiker is now family by default.We were invited to choose from a closet full of random jammies to wear after taking a shower so that we would have something other than rain gear to wear while our clothes washed and dried. We wore our loaned jammies into town to eat supper. It's a trail town, and I think the local business people are accustomed to that.The local Baptist church is hosting an AYCE hiker breakfast in the morning, and we are considering going. I think I'll keep my silver pentacle pendant inside my shirt.Anyway, I'm typing this on my phone, mostly just to get something out. Maybe we can get to a desktop computer tomorrow and post some pictures.What pack would Margaret carry?Loki
Postscrip 4/2 1300- We were picked up on the Baptist bus at 0730, which then took us to the church where we were served a free and very copious AYCE pancake and bacon breakfast. After that, we went to a local grocery for some minor resupply. While there, we heard from the cashier that another group was serving a free lunch for hikers and homeless (is there a difference?) in the park across the street. In all, we have been quite overwhelmed with the level of generosity of this community.
Now back to the hostel for a nap.","Hiawassee, GA

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559445,"Sunday, 4/9, day 19. We have made it to Fontana Dam, 166 miles, and we're still at it. 
Our ability to post new stuff on this journal has been more sporadic than I might have anticipated. Internet access has been spotty, and as I referred to before, town days are a lot more frenetic than I might have thought. By the time we get a shower, do some laundry, resupply, and eat a hamburger larger than my head, the morning or afternoon is pretty well shot. Town days are so frantic, we are soon ready to get back to the trail where all we have to do is walk. 
I have been meaning to send out a special THANK YOU to out snack-packing crew. We think of you fondly at least every two hours. <
p>When we went to do laundry today, I needed to wash pretty much all my clothing. That meant I walked over to the laundromat wearing only my rain parka and rain skirt, so I felt like quite a fashion plate. Imagine my devastation when we met up there with some other trail folks, and a gentleman dressed in the rain fly from his tent. I had been completely outdone in the fashion department. I shall have to do better in the future. 
We have experienced quite a wide range of weather. At times it has been 70 degrees and sunny. We had a stretch of violent thunderstorms; one afternoon we found ourselves with 23 other hikers in a 6 person shelter, waiting out the worst of it. And when we climbed up out from the Nantahala Outdoor Center, we found ourselves in a howling, wind-driven snowstorm that inspired us to stay at the next shelter for 36 hours until things settled down. Overall, the experience has been largely what we expected, and some of it has actually been easier than expected. No foot trouble, no significant ortho issues. Thank goodness for Ibuprofen. 
Tomorrow morning we enter Smoky Mountains National Park. We are told that the last storm left about 6 inches of snow on the high points, but today was sunny and warm, and likely the snow will have melted. The weather for the next few days looks good, so hopefully we can transit the Smokies without signficant weather issues. 
There's no place I'd rather be right now. Thanks for all your kind words of support, I always look forward to getting back in range to check Email. Hopefully Berries can add some photos tonight.

Mile 273.4.Reports of us having been killed and eaten by bears have been highly exaggerated. Internet access has been limited, and time in town has been busy; thus posting has been more infrequent than might have been anticipated. We have passed several significant milestones. We made it through Smoky Mountain National Park, 70.5 miles, in 6 days. It was sunny and warm, with only a little rain at night, which I gather never happens.

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560741,"OK, a full day today in Hot Springs, then back on the trail in the morning. I now seem to have a reliable 0600 alarm in my head (or maybe it's in my bladder). At any rate, I seem to be consistently waking up early every day. Maybe I'm finally recovering from years of working the night shift, and returning to my natural circadian rythm. We spent yesterday showering, doing laundry, eating and making plans for today. On today's agenda we have shopping/restocking, napping, and of course overeating. Hot Springs is a pretty nice little town. We explored the local hardware store this morning. It was the kind of place where whatever you want, it is likely there, but the place is so crammed to the rafters that you need someone to find it for you. Also the kind of place with a shop dog, and several loitering geezers in overalls to pet the dog. I bought an outdoor faucet, which I intend to pack into the next shelter. I will nail it up to the shelter wall and label it ""free dehydrated water dispenser"". I would be remiss if I failed to thank the fine folks who have offered us trail magic over the last few days. On Snowbird Mountain, we were gifted with freshly prepared PBJ sandwiches and homemade banana pudding, as well as cold drinks and sundry other items. And the lovely folks at the SR1182 crossing gave us cold drinks and fruit. Many thanks to all!The local public library offers access to desktop computers as well as free wifi. They even have some benches out front under an awning, perfect for poaching the wifi after hours, which seem to be in much use. We went into the local outfitter to pick up some minor replacement items. It seemed to be a rather charming combination of outdoor outfitter, natural foods store and headshop. We were looking at boot insoles with the smell of incense and the sound of Bob Marley in the air. We also went into a sort of combination art gallery/ice cream store/coffee shop, where I consumed a double espresso and a brownie rich enough to cause projectile ovulation in an entire herd of dairy cows at 50 paces. I now feel capable of going from here to the grocery and purchasing Ramen noodles and pouch chicken for the entire Eastern seaboard. In any case, I guess I'll go on and finish the other wifi tasks on the list. Thanks to all for your attention and encouragement. It's always great to hear from you. Loki","Hot Springs

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561618," 4/25/17 day 35, mile 342.7. We had our worst weather stretch so far. It rained somewhere between 2 and 3 inches, with high winds and temperatures in the 40s from Saturday night until Monday (yesterday) morning. On Saturday night we were in a shelter, started out in the rain Sunday morning. We hiked 10 miles in the rain and wind and arrived at the next shelter to find it was full. Thus soaked to the skin, we set up the tent in the rain, doing our best to keep the bedding dry, and stayed in the tent for the next 15 hours. Yesterday morning it was still windy and overcast, but at least not raining. We put on our soaking wet boots and socks, and hiked 18 miles into Erwin where our next mail drop awaited (thanks, Pat!)in addition to a hot shower and a real bed. After all that, taking the boots off and going indoors was a transcendent experience. The hostel owner even allowed us to use his garage to put up a clothesline for all our wet gear. He also has a newly purchased electric boot dryer, which we have been making good use of. 
We just returned from a trip to town, where we did some shopping of a minor nature, and also had lunch at the local BBQ joint called ""Hog n Dog"". The hostel owner indicated this place had some of the finest pulled pork on earth, and I cannot say that this was inaccurate. The pork comes on a plate without sauce, and there are about 8 varieties of homemade sauce on the table for the customer to choose and try. Very good and very fun. 
A word about resupply day: It's the best and also the worst day on the trail. It's the best because we have new food (have I mentioned the overarching importance of FOOD?) It's also the worst because now my pack is suddenly 15 pounds heavier. This is also compounded by the fact that every town we come to is in a river valley, and so the first thing we face when leaving town is a 2-3 thousand foot climb with the suddenly DAMNED heavy pack. Why can't they put a town on top of a hill? Just one? Speaking of which, I have also noticed that every single water source, be it spring, lake, pond or mud puddle, is always at the bottom of an incline. I intend to take this matter up with someone in authority, as soon as I find one. 
Our food on the trail consists of breakfasts, suppers and snacks. The majority of the calories consumed on the trail are the snacks, which we consume on the fly every two hours. Each of us carries a food bag, mine with my snacks and breakfasts, and Berries' with her snacks and suppers. Every evening we pull out the supper, tomorrow's breakfast and tomorrow's snacks for the next day. Berries gets to choose the supper, and I get to choose the breakfast, primarily based on what looks the heaviest. Have I mentioned the importance of food? 
One of the most interesting thing about the landscapes we have been walking through is the variability of the flora depending on both altitude and latitude. As we head north, and go up and down in elevation, the types and stages of trees and wildflowers have varied drastically. In some places the wildflowers have been magnificent. There are many plant varieties we recognize from home, and others that are really neat but we have no idea what they are. In some places we have been able to gather some wild edibles to compliment our dried food. 
At any rate, that's all for now. I intend to go check on the progress on our drying gear, pet the resident dogs, and perhaps take a nap. The weather forecast looks better for the next few days, so hopefully we can get back our reasonably early in the morning and make some more miles. Thanks to all for your love, support and attention.

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562982,"Damascus, VA mile 468.7 day 43, May 4-
We started out at Springer Mountain doing 8-10 miles a day, taking it pretty slow. We had increased that to doing 15-18 miles a day, and on 5/2 actually did 22.7. And then my knee blew up. It started out feeling a little tender, and then yesterday morning it would not bear weight. I took a heroic dose of Motrin and hobbled the remaining 10 miles into town, got to our room, and visited the local medical clinic. I now have a course of Prednisone, a knee brace, and an invitation to RICE it (rest, ice, elevation and compression). We had scheduled one zero, and have now spoken for a second. Needless to say, my frustration is boundless. I am trying to be philosophical about it.
There are a couple of hostels whose praises I must put out there. We came into the Cantarosso hostel in Erwin, TN thoroughly soaked and exhausted. Mike and Peggy, the owners, had no cabins open, but rented us their guest room. They took us into their home and treated us as guests, even allowing us to use their garage to hang our wet gear to dry. Bob also turned us on to Hog and Dog, a superlative BBQ joint owned by a friend of his. Anyone in Erwin wanting a clean, quiet place to R and R from the trail would be well served to check out Cantarosso Hostel.
Bob Peoples at Kincora Hostel near Hampton TN is a treasure of a human being. He's been running this funky little place for 21 years and about 23,000 hikers. He's also a major contributor to the local trail maintenance efforts, putting a huge number of hours in. His rates consist of a suggested 5 dollar contribution which is collected on the honor system. He acknowledged to me that a fair number of hikers likely come in when he is away, use the shower, charge their electronics, and he never sees them at all. And he's apparently OK with that. Bob clearly does what he does for love, not money. I would invite anyone who stays there and can do so to consider putting in a 20 or 50 dollar bill into the donation box.
I have really begun to appreciate the Rhododendron that grows widely in these mountains. It's a large and rampant shrub with broad, evergreen leaves. Wind driven snow, sun beating down, need for privacy for an off-trail excavation project? Rhododendron is your best friend and shelter.
The trail tends to encourage outlandish behavior, and we've had the pleasure to meet some pretty interesting characters. Night before last we shared a shelter with Toe. Long story short, this older gentleman had a serious hammer toe which was an obstacle to hiking. An orthopedic surgeon he consulted wanted to reconstruct the toe for 40,000 dollars. So he got together with a neighbor and they cut the damned thing off. Toe now wears his toe as a pendant. Obvious trail name.","

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563197,"Taking a second zero today in Damascus. After some better living through chemistry and some RICE, the knee is feeling much better. Prednisone is a hell of a drug.
We have one more mountain, Mt Rogers, to climb before we settle in to the relative flatness of the remainder of Virginia. Looks like it tops out around 5300 feet. If it weren't for that, we would likely send some clothing layers ahead. As it is, snow is possible on our next leg. I think we'll send layers ahead from the next stop.
We've got new shoes. The old ones were outgrown. Hypertrophy of the feet seems to be pretty standard for those of us who have made it this far. I've gone up 1-1/2 sizes.","

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564489,"Saturday, May 13, day 53- I haven't posted since Damascus because there was little of note and what there was wasn't very positive. Things are looking up now.
2 days of resting my bad knee in Damascus was not sufficient. We hiked three days from there, and I found myself pretty much unable to walk. We stumbled over Mount Rogers (check out the feral ponies photos) and got a ride here from Massey Gap. I've spent the week icing my knee, laying around and eating Prednisone.
Today we got a ride north to Fox Creek, then slack packed 10 miles back to here. The knee's still a little tender, but I feel ready to start back north tomorrow with a lighter pack and diminished mileage expectations.
Having cleared the Highlands, we are now feeling safe in mailing forward some of our cold weather clothing (looks like temps in the 80s this upcoming week, don't think the down jacket will be needed). That and some redistribution will lighten my pack for the first couple of days. I trust we can continue, and none too soon. This has been a pretty nice place, with a quiet room at the back of the store, and a little river flowing outside, but we're both eager to be making some miles.
An interesting note regarding trail magic: it comes in many flavors. At one road crossing, we were greeted by a local Baptist enthusiast with his dog, Moses and a copious dose of fundamentalist Christianity to go with the lemonade. Contrast this with another trailhead where we found a younger crowd stocked with large volumes of cold beer on ice, deafening heavy metal music, many cigarettes (some taxable, some not) and intoxicated nubile young maidens dancing on top of large rocks. We were entertained by both in different ways, but did not stay long at either.
Anyway, the weather forecast looks like clear and sunny for the next several days, and it looks like we'll be back in business. As always, thanks for love and support from all of you. It means much to us both.

We had several days of rainy weather coming into here. We put on wet shoes and socks at least two days in a row. In many places, the trail was actually a stream several inches deep (we'll try to post photos). Today was gloriously sunny, and much of our gear spent the day out basking itself dry. Life is much better.
Due to time constraints and the scarcity of wifi connection, I haven't posted as frequently as I would have liked to. Also, the last one didn't go out for some reason. I'll have to relate the tale of the Great Partnership Shelter Pizza Extravaganza in person to you all.

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567978,"Friday, June 8, day 80-We hitched a ride from the trailhead into town yesterday, and stayed the night with some relatives of Berries where we had a maildrop.  We have now showered, done laundry, resupplied and overeaten.  Back to the trail after this entry.  We had heard great things about the AYCE (that's ALL YOU CAN EAT, a through hiker's favorite phrase) Chinese restaurant here in town.  We went there for lunch yesterday and did some serious damage to the food cost of that business. It turned out to be a pretty nice spread, kind of like the Golden Corral of Chinese food.  There was a huge salad bar, a sushi section, and a wide variety of other foods including a section with a grill and attendant standing by to stir fry your selection of ingredients. There was also an indoor Koi pond, with several dozen 10 to 14 inch Koi swimming around.  Maybe it was because I have never been fully domesticated, or because by this time I am somewhat protein depleted, or maybe it was just that I should not appear in public.  At any rate, I felt overwhelmed by the urge to grab one of the Koi from the pond, and present it to the grilling station still flopping for grilling.  There was even a fine garlic and ginger sauce which would have made a fine accompaniment for fresh fish. Expressing this sentiment earned me a glaring example of THE LOOK from Berries.  I should actually be grateful; it's likely that THE LOOK has saved me from more than one incarceration.  A hiker we shared a shelter with recently expressed the theory that the AT is divided into three parts, each with it's own challenges.  The first third is physical, the second third is psychological, and the final third is nutritional.  I tend to believe there is some wisdom in this view.  I don't think each phase is distinct, though. I think it is cumulative. I would assert that the physical challenges extend throughout the trail, and the psychological extends into the nutritional.   I feel like I have used up most of my protein reserves, and small animals, snakes (and Koi) may have cause to fear my passing.  The weather has been mostly pretty good, only one rainy day in the last week.  It has been sunny and cooler the last few days, but more heat is predicted.  We made a little over our 100 mile goal last week Monday to Sunday, and will likely pass the 900 mile mark this weekend.  Only 1300 miles to go!The major NOBO bubble has spread out and many folks are now off the trail, meaning there is usually room in the shelters for us.  The shelters tend to get fuller if it's raining, but people are usually pretty good about moving over and making room.  Actually, if we don't get some rain, some of the water sources may start to dry up.  Well, back to the trail.  I'll try to put out some further entries as connectivity becomes available.  Thanks to all for your love and support. ","

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569278,"Tuesday June 20 day 91-We have now walked just over 1000 miles. Harper's Ferry is the psychological 1/2 way point, and home of the ATC headquarters. We stopped in there yesterday and had the traditional photos taken under the ATC sign for the archives. We were numbers 930 and 931 for the year. We have also made it out of Virginia, where we have been for the last 6 weeks.  Virginia has the largest single expanse of trail of all 14 states.  

Much of the last 100 miles of Virginia has been in Shenandoah National Park, sometimes referred to as the Easydoahs.  The trail itself is largely pretty smooth and level, because the Federales only own the tops of the ridges, and if the trail went too far downhill it would be on private property.  The trail also parallels Skyline Drive through the park, and there are frequent waysides near the trail with restaurants and small resupply sources. So the bottom line is that one should be able to make some good miles in the Shenandoah's,  but it doesn't happen because one stops for cheeseburgers and ice cream too often.  

We hiked for a time with a group of Anabaptist (Amish? Mennonite? not certain) folks who were out for a section hike.  They were dressed in the traditional clothing, lots of long sleeves and hats (Cotton!) I was hiking shirtless and sweating copiously, I can't imagine how they must have felt.  The traditional garb was topped off with packs, hiking boots and trekking poles, quite a fashion statement.  The patriarch of the group wore the obligatory beard-no-moustache visage that always brings to my mind the image of someone spying out the hind end of a deer on folks.They were certainly hiking their own hike.  

As I have referred to, it has been pretty hot and humid, at least to us Yankees.  80s and low 90s with 150% humidity.  I sweat like a freak at the drop of a hat at the best of times, and I've been hiking shirtless for 10 to 12 hours a day.  My pack suspension smells bad.  No, really bad.  Imagine selecting the crustiest possible athletic sock from the very back corner of Satan's high school gym locker.  Take that sock and stow it behind the filthiest shower stall in the sketchiest hiker hostel in the universe, then leave it to ferment in its own funk until the end of time.  That's how my pack smells.  I have been debating between incinerating my pack at the end of the trip, or possibly donating it to the International Institute For The Study Of Skin Flora Gone Horribly Wrong as an aid to their research.  We've discovered a new daily game we call Millennial Leapfrog.  It works like this: we don't hike very fast, but we keep right at it.  We usually start walking sometime between 0630 and 0730.  Mid morning, we begin to see the millennials passing us right and left like we were standing still.  Then at mid-day, we see these same young folks again, reclining on rocks in the sun, eating lunch and smoking the famous tax-free cigarettes.  Afternoon brings another flurry of passing.  Often we then end up staying at the same shelter or campsite at the end of the day with the youngsters.  Different ways of achieving the same goal.  

We're taking a zero day today, last day off was 300+ miles ago at Four Pines Hostel.  We got together last night and this morning with Berry's father and his wife, had a walk along the towpath and some dinner.  We had ice cream for lunch today, followed by a nice nap in the air conditioned room.  Back out on the trail tomorrow.  We have been able to mark off another 100 mile mark every Sunday for the last 3 weeks, and intend to continue doing so.  

Berries broke one of her breathtakingly expensive but extremely light carbon fiber hiking poles.  The manufacturer was quite responsive to her, and has sent out a free replacement.  The only issue is that we underestimated our upcoming mileage, and it had not arrived at the hostel it was shipped to by the time we left there.  Berries is on the phone now tryin to find her package a ride up the trail.  

Well, it's time for us to figure out a destination for tonight's final overeating prior to leaving in the AM.  Thanks to all for your kind words of encouragement in the guest book.  We will try to upload some new photos.   What would Margaret do?","

This is Reverend Loki, preaching the love from the bully pulpit of the Barbarian Utopia within the department of Jackpine Savagery.
You will all have to pardon me, that last has been brewing in my mind for the last 50 or so miles.  Actually, I may have to learn to be a bit more circumspect in my prose.  After my last post detailing the depths of the stench of my pack suspension, some readers have been threatening to suspend my poetic license.  
We have now made it well into Pennsylvania. This is the place where it is said that hiking boots go to die, due to the legendary rockiness of the trail. Actually it hasn't been bad thus far; in fact we spent today traversing the Cumberland Valley, with smooth and level trail going between corn and soybean fields.  That promises to change tomorrow, with the AWOL guide predicting more rocky conditions and steeper topography.  We will see.  
I have been remiss in not detailing the experience of trekking the Roller Coaster, a stretch of trail just north of Shenandoah National Park with 13-1/2 miles of alternate descents and ascents, both steep and rocky.  I believe this section of trail was designed by the royal trail crew of the court of the Marquis De Sade.  It was not helpful that the day we walked the Roller Coaster, it was in the low 90s with 150% humidity.  I intend to contact the Appalachian Trail Conservancy with the recommendation this piece of trail be renamed the Meat Grinder. By the time we were done for the day, we both felt pretty ground up.  The only bright spot on that day was that we finished it at the Bear's Den Hostel, with showers, cold drinks, pizza and a bunk.  June 21 was the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year.  It is also traditionally naked hiking day.  It has been asserted that a certain persons may have hiked that day in a state of blatant pantslessness. I cannot comment on this, having no personal knowledge of the alleged activity, but the allegations have been made.  I will say the weather was such as to be conducive to hiking in such garb.  I have also heard that more than the usual amount of sunscreen may have been used on this occasion.  
On Sunday, we passed the halfway mark.  Actually, several halfway marks.  Since the trail keeps being rerouted and slightly lengthened every year, the halfway mark keeps moving south, and each time it is moved a new halfway monument is erected.  
My bad knee is nearly recovered.  Today is the first time in months when I used no Motrin.  We walked from our room to a local diner for dinner earlier, and I left my brace in the room without really missing it.  It seems the knee has responded well to my threats to leave it behind in the trail if it didn't behave.  
Since we left Harper's Ferry, we seem to be hiking with a much smaller crowd.  We seem to be hiking pretty consistently with the same 25-20 people.  I think that's a function of the bubble spreading out, and also some folks getting off the trail.  It's kind of sobering when one really thinks about it.  
We are meeting up with Berries' brother and sister in law near the Delaware Water Gap in a couple of weeks, and the are planning to hike with us for a few days. We are trying to line up an REI order for them to bring with them, some new shoes and other items to replace things that have been worn out or lost along the way. Looking forward to a rain cover for my pack that is actually waterproof.  
A free hiker feed is being held by a church group in Duncannon, about 20 miles north of here, tomorrow afternoon.  We are going to try to make it there.  Free calories are always appreciated.  
Well, I think I will go take another shower and go to sleep.  Thanks as always for all your love and support.  It's always great to hear from those who sign the guest book. ","

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571118,"Friday, July 7, day 108-We are currently taking an unexpected zero day.  It is raining, and we are waiting for the rocks to dry out.  It was hazardous enough in the dry, and it seems foolhardy to attempt the rocks in the rain.  Oh yes, we have found the rocks.  Jagged irregular shaped rocks from grapefruit size to small building size.  Nasty sharp ankle-breaking rocks that have us making about 1/2 mile per hour at times.  Life on the trail has been really pretty awful.  Maybe this was a good time to have a day off after all.  We stopped in Port Clinton to pick up a mail drop, and also went to the local Cabela's for Berries to purchase new footwear.  It was a hot and humid day, and I was hanging out in the shade in front of the store, leaning back against my pack on the concrete.  A car occupied by an elder couple pulled up to the curb nearby.  The woman got out of the passenger side of the car and approached me, asking whether I had eaten and whether I wanted a place to shower and shave.  She had assumed by my appearance that I was among the local homeless population (which I guess was technically true). I thanked her profusely, but told her I had everything I needed.  A few days ago, we got hit by a thunderstorm and heavy rain.  Fortunately we soon came to a highway bridge over a small river.  We ended up taking refuge under the bridge for a couple of hours, cooking dinner and waiting for the rain to stop.  It felt like a real homeless situation under the bridge.  And then a very large cottonmouth came swimming up, looking for dessert.  He swam away as soon as I stood up to get a better look. We did not stay much longer after that.  That was our third venomous snake encounter, and we have also sighted bears on several occasions.  At one point Berries was in her usual place just ahead of me on the trail, and I suddenly heard a sonic boom.  I looked up to find that the noise was made by Berries levitating back up the trail toward me faster than the speed of sound.  I looked up the trail ahead to see a timber rattler about 4 feet long and the diameter of my wrist in the middle of the trail, with rattles abuzz. We stood back and let him go on his way.  Anyway, we hope to get back to the trail in the morning.  We have about 40 more miles to get to Delaware Water Gap, the New Jersey border, and hopefully out of the rocks.  Thanks to all of our supporters.  I understand people have enjoyed my writing, and I've certainly had a lot of fun putting it out there.","

Just a quick note on the phone to let everyone know we're still out here.
We've made it into Connecticut. The small towns are much different here. They all look like campuses of Ivy League colleges, and inexpensive food and lodging are nonexistent. We're staying tonight in the spare room in a local woman's house. 
We were joined for a few days by Berries brother and sister in law, Jamie and Peggy. They hiked with us for five days, then slack-packed us for a couple. Peggy was kind enough to bring some meals which gave us a welcome change. Thanks to both of them.
We were also joined by Greg, an old friend of Berries, for a few days. He did some hiking with us, and also provided for some off trail transportation that was very welcome. Thanks Greg!
Jamie and Peggy were kind enough to bring a large tub, a scrub brush and some cleaning products so that we could wash our packs. Needless to say, the wash water was immediately black. The end result for me was that my pack suspension still smells evil, but is no longer a violation of the Geneva Convention.
The weather has continued 90 degrees and high humidity, quite miserable, but today it rained hard in the morning. Now it's in the 60s, overcast, cool and quite pleasant.
Across the alley from where we are staying, there's a cemetery dating back to the 1750s European human history goes back further here than at home.
That's all for now, I'll add more when I have access to a desktop computer.","

It seems like we've been on the trail for a lifetime, and yet the time has gone so quickly. We have slightly over 600 miles remaining, which would seem like a lot more if we hadn't come so far already. 
When I look at the hikers in the bubble around us, it's pretty clear that we left the ""B team"" behind some time ago. They are a pretty lean, focused and determined lot. They smell bad, carry worn and filthy gear, and many have the table manners and social skills of rabid chipmunks. I feel honored to be counted among them.
We've rented quite a number of low budget rooms along the way. We're working on an official seediness scale for evaluating cheap motel rooms. Such factors as the relative vintage of the graffiti on the back of the bathroom door, and the relative number of bloodstains on the carpet will be evaluated. 
A good room will provide shampoo. A better one may have conditioner. Recently I was in the shower and noticed the mini shampoo bottle claimed to be ""normalizing shampoo"". After showering and drying off, I was still inclined to keep hiking, so apparently it didn't work. Multiple applications may be required.
We are anticipating receipt of a package in the next town, Williamstown, containing new shoes for each of us. That package has been delayed and will not arrive until Wednesday, so we've been doing some lower mileage days so as not to have to wait there. 
From here we climb up Mount Greylock, the introductory New England mountain. Looks like we will be hiking at about 4000 feet for the foreseeable future. Should be good preparation for the White Mountains in New Hampshire.
We are tenting on the lawn of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility Church tonight. I would like you all to go say 5 Hail Grandma Gatewoods, and 10 Our Earl Shafers, and consider yourself absolved.

I haven't been able to post of late. All the wifi connections in Vermont and New Hampshire are wood fired, and the weather was until recently too warm to fire them up. I'm submitting this one from the White Mountains by way of a friendly yak herder to whom I had to pay two Snickers bars and my first born daughter. His loss.
The Whites are really tough, but the rewards are also great. The trails are steep, rocky and muddy, frequently requiring four limbs to climb. Progress has been glacially slow. The landscapes have been stupendous. This is some of the most majestic country I've seen in the lower 48. I hope the photos do justice.
We are now about 37 trail miles from Maine, and 1870 miles out of 2190 are behind us. Barring any catastrophic events, I think we will finish. Whether we get to Katahdin before they close the mountain is going to be a near thing. Stay tuned, check out the pictures, and I'll post again when I can.","

The notch is considered to be the most difficult or fun mile of the AT. It's a mile long slot canyon tossed full of house sized rocks which must be scaled, crawled under or around. The arm is immediately afterward, and involves a 2000 foot very steep climb. We managed to make 5 miles in 9 hours that day.

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577789,"Day 179, 2075.3 miles behind us, 114.5 to go.  We're taking a zero day today, likely our last on the trail, to regroup for the home stretch.  From Monson we enter the ""100 mile wilderness"", a long stretch of wild lands leading up to the end point of the trail on Mt. Katahdin.  This is likely the last post prior to our finishing the trail.  As I have expressed before, we both have mixed feelings regarding the end of the trail.  Our gear is pretty shredded and worn out, and so are we.  Really looking forward to getting home, seeing our dog, sleeping in our own bed, getting my hands back into my own soil.  I'm also certain that as soon as we finish, we'll begin to miss trail life.  We'll miss our trail family and the simple routine of walk, eat, sleep, repeat.  We've been very fortunate in terms of weather.  For the last week or so it's been sunny and pleasant.  The fall colors are more advanced than I would expect for the middle of September, and some of the mountaintop vistas have been truly stunning.  The woods have the perfume of freshly fallen leaves and spruce.  Very Indian summer-ish, except that no frost has yet fallen.  We just finished consolidating and packing up our last mail drop.  We're heading out with about 7 days of food, and the packs are ridiculously heavy, but this is currently necessary due to lack of resupply options in the Wilderness.  At least we can say our packs are the heaviest they will be for the rest of the trip, and will get progressively lighter from here.  It seems some of my writings in this journal have come to the attention of local academia, and I've been offered a job.Apparently Maine is undergoing an epidemic of folks suffering from Sense of Humor Inhibition Trauma Syndrome (SHITS).  In response to this trend, the University of Maine has constructed a new Hyperbolic Chamber.  Victims of SHITS will be placed in this chamber and subjected to various types of audio media written by a wide variety of raconteurs, prevaricators and exaggerators until they regain their sense of humor.  The University has offered me employment among this group of writers.  Alas, my public at home needs me more.  We are tentatively scheduled to be in Baxter State Park on Monday, 9/25 and to summit Katahdin on Tuesday, 9/26.  Anyone who wants to join us is welcome.  If events go as planned, the next post will include summit photos.  As always, thanks for all the love and support.  WWMD?","

Loki and Berries,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578631,"We finished.  We're done.  
We summitted Mt. Katahdin, the northern terminus of the Appalachia Trail, yesterday.  We hit the sign at the summit at 1148.  
The Hundred Mile Wilderness was absolutely gorgeous, perhaps the most scenic section of the entire trail.  Every shelter seemed to be located on a pond full of loons, and it was mostly remote enough to be completely free of any road noise (which is rarer than you might think).  We took 8 days to make it through the Wilderness, but then that's pretty characteristic of our hike as a whole. 
The weather has been unusually warm and sunny for the last week or so.  It's been in the 80s, sunny and humid.  I never expected to be back to hiking shirtless and sweating profusely in Maine at the end of September.   
Baxter Peak, the highest point of Katahdin (and also of Maine) proved to be a rather stringent final exam.  It's steep and rocky, often involving climbing up and down near-vertical rock faces.  It took us 11-1/2 hours to go up a little over five miles and back.  And it was worth the effort.  We got some great photos at the peak.  
189 days
2190.3 miles

40 pounds of body weight
32,000 milligrams of Ibuprofen
Now we're taking a day off in Millinocket.  The burning question of the day is, if you take a day off after finishing the trail, does it still count as a zero?   Tomorrow we intend to get a ride out to Bangor, rent a car, and go off in search of lobster.  We catch a train out of Boston on Tuesday to go back to Michigan. We are looking forward to giving extensive slide shows to anyone who will sit still long enough.  
Again, many thanks to all our supporters.  We could not have done it without you.","
