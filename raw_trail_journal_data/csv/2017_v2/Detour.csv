Wander about 100 yards on a side trail (through what seemed like a forest of poison ivy). Found a decent spot to pitch tent. Took an hour and a half to hang bear bag.

After good advice from a friendly fellow at the shelter, we decided three miles and lunch and a night out of the woods would be a great way to recoup. So we hit the trail and immediately found bear tracks. We followed them nearly all the way to the Route 30, mesmerized the entire time. They seemed fresh but we had no way of knowing. Upon resurfacing, we took a left down the road and headed for the hostel. We found Timber restaurant and hunkered down for a delicious home-styled country meal which ended with an amazing banana split. It was heaven. A friendly couple gave us a ride down the road three tenths of a mile. While riding with them, I realized my dad was really close so I gave him a holla and we met up for dinner just a short while after. He bought us dinner cause he's the best and then brought us to Walmart for some supplies. He also bought those for us. Today, my dad was my trail angel. It was a great day. At one point I turned to Adrienne and said, ""It's been so nice to think of people as angels instead of demons all the time.""  That thought is sticking with me a while, I think.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

Hilton, Northern Lights and Forrest (the dog) became our hiking partners for the day. We ate three meals with them as we followed each other through the woods. So cool to meet new people and learn. I'm a teacher but I love to learn. Just want to be a better person and more importantly, a better husband. Oh, also, Adrienne finally got a trail name. It's Ishmael.

Starting to figure out how this whole thing works and finding some good strategies. On the way down to the campground, we followed an ""unmaintained trail."" Turns out that actually means you have to basically  bushwack as it was totally overgrown. That was an experience to say the least. Looking forward to tomorrow and more miles.

Detour,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565101,"Today was maybe the most eventful thus far. Started off with organizing our oversized maildrop into two halves and deciding on more stuff to send home. Once we packed up our belongings, we walked to the road and stuck our thumbs up for the first time. Five minutes later we were riding with out first ever hitch. Turns out his son is currently on the AT, go figure. He brought us to the post office and then to a great place for sandwiches. After eating a wonderful lunch, we stuck our thumbs up again until another friendly soul picked us up and brought us back to the ""trail."" Well, thing is, the unmaintained trail we had come down the day before was not on our list of top options for getting back to the AT. We decided a dirt road that intersected the trail would be easier. So we were dropped off and started looking. While gazing at our map and phone, a dude across the street gave us some info. He said to look for ""a trailer, a gate, a log and two roads."" In about a half mile we found our dirt road and started heading up it feeling quite confident and relieved to not take the same awful trail from the day before. Soon enough, our road ended and became hunting trails marked with orange tape. We decided to carry on, hoping we were on the right track. We weren't. After the trail took so many turns I wasn't quite sure which way we were going or supposed to go, I opted for the map, compass and GPS on our phone. In about a half hour, we felt dreadfully lost and started bushwhacking south. At just about the point we thought we were for sure lost, I felt like the trail was just above the hill we were on. In a last ditch effort, we pushed forward and soon enough, we were on the AT again. I had never been so happy to see white paint. That first blaze was a thing of beauty. It was about 20 after 3 and were were about a mile and a half back from where we left off the day before. We trucked forward for about twenty minutes and Ishmael (Adrienne) dug it hard. I ran back to make sure she was ok and somehow she had managed to only bruise her knee. We got her on her feet and pressed forward till we found a spot to camp. And just when it seemed the day couldn't get any stranger, as we're setting up camp, a four or five foot snake slithered through and circled us twice before heading off and vanishing in the woods. We settled down for the night, had dinner and gratefully laid down on our sleeping pads for a nice evening of rest.","Mountain Creek Campground

Also started to really discover walking flatfooted, mostly because if I stepped wrong my feet hurt. Honestly, they're almost in shambles. But many people and specifically a lady at an outfitter said, ""listen to your body."" Well, I'm listening. I guess that mostly means listening to it when it hurts.

Three weeks in and coming up on a month. I think we're both feeling pretty good and like bigger miles are ahead.

An hour of delicious food and all the hunting stories he could tell. It was the best. Then we hit the trail and soon met a couple (hikers and very cool) and then a dude who did most of the hike with us. We talked the whole time and really just enjoyed each other's company. At 6pm, we were near the summit, said goodbye to our buddy and made dinner. Then, we pushed another 3 miles till dark and found a sick campsite. Before this trip, I would have been freaking out at 6pm without a campsite. But I wasn't. I was excited about hiking into the dark. Sometimes you do things in this life and they make you.

Just when it looked like the trail would clear up and smooth out, we'd get more rocks. Sometimes thousands of tiny rocks you just had to step over, sometimes medium size ones you would try to step between and then some of it just cold, wet boulders you had to maneuver through. 4 miles of it took forever because we was scared for our lives (maybe more like ankles and broken legs) the entire time. But we pushed through and just cranked out the miles. Finally made it to a shelter and decided to trek another 4 miles to a B&B so we could clean up and dry off. But we pushed off almost immediately as the owner of the establishment had warned us to get there earlier rather than later. So I threw my wet socks back on my still soaked feet and trudged on through what I thought would turn into 4 or 5 blisters. But I made it there. 4 miles in only a couple hours and thank god it was mostly dirt road at that point. Making food and drinking a pitcher of beer, letting my poor feet rest.

At one point (in the pitch black of night), clicked my poles to warn animals of our presence and heard something (something quite big) scurry up a tree directly above us. Also, before wandering into the night, stepped right over a rattlesnake cause I was not looking at my feet for literally 30 seconds cause I was talking with someone.

Destroyed some pizza logs, a buffalo chicken salad and then Izzy (Ishmael's nickname courtesy the great Eric Needs) had a cheese steak sandwich and I devoured a bacon cheeseburger. I think hiker hunger is finally setting in. Polished off a couple brews and got back on trail slightly, let's say, happy. After about 30 minutes on trail, we ""pulled over"" for a quick 45 minute nap. Lesson learned, keep brews to a minimum of 1 for lunch and wait at least 30-40 before hiking after a large meal. Swung in to the shelter a coupe hours later, had another quick meal and enjoyed talks with our latest trail buds Axel, Pollen and Pigpen.

Detour,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568491,"Got up and sprinted through the trail at a reasonable pace. Found some trail magic in the form of free water. Trail magic is anytime you receive a gift while on trail. Saying goes, the trail provides. 
So bear story time, while still in NJ, we came across a point where I heard a bunch of rustling, bigger and clumsier than a dear. I felt like it was of decent size and that it was scurrying away. I paused to look around but couldn't see anything. Ishmael came down round the bend and the look on her eyes! ""I see a bear!"" She whispered over and over again. I waddled over quietly to where she was and saw him slipping off into the forest. We were both stunned. We felt alive and aware. He was a tiny guy but there seemed to be no mother. He appeared to be alone. But we didn't do anything. We just watched a moment and then continued on our way. 
We made it to the the state line and had a snack, still talking about the bear. We had hiked 5 weeks and just had our first encounter. He made a short vid to remember the moments and then up our bags went and further into the forest we dove. 
As we started New York, I could sense the trail and landscape change. It all got much rougher. Some challenging little climbs along with a mile or so run along rocky ridge work, we were having fun. We trekked on after a short water break knowing that we were nearing our side trail and our exit from the woods for the day. I was slightly ahead of Ishmael when I heard a similar scourging noise to the right and in the woods a bit. I immediately thought again bear because it was a similar sound. I quietly hopped up on some rocks to get a better look and that's when I saw her. She appeared out of nowhere to my left and back in the woods. Could have been 20 feet or 20 yards, couldn't tell you now, it all happened very quickly. As she popped up our eyes met and I feel we both had similar ideas. ""You're rather large."" She kinda hooted in the direction of the other noise and hurried away. It seemed to be some kind of command for her cubs to recognize. 
I had just encountered a bear with cubs. My mind raced. I pulled back but made noise and took a steady pace to exit. Izzy and I talked about what to do. We clicked our rods and made noise with those while trying to talk peacefully but sternly with the bear to let her know we were more than one and also not there to cause harm. We stood our ground a moment but realized after a short while, we should go on. The bears seemed to disappear off to the right of the trail. There had been a short scamper but then nothing to follow. Just no noise at all. We were baffled that they could escape so quickly and quietly but they had and we were thankful that the situation had ended as soon as it began. 
We finished the hike out of the woods and made it to lunch. We gorged on some heavenly slices at a pizza spot in town and then caught a bus into the city. We arrived at Emily's and just chilled. Decided to take a day off tomorrow so we could figure out this sleep system glitch. We had survived the night before but had been cold since we had only a sheet. But Ishmael had slept in the entirety of her rain gear and she had claimed to be toasty even. Tomorrow would consist of sorting this out, what to buy and how to continue getting good rest.","Wawayanda Shelter

We weren't sure in which order, so we went to the diner and let food help us decide. After a great meal, we sauntered down the street to the massage place. We both got deep tissue and it was my first massage like that. I felt like parts of me were releasing tension and hurting in ways I had not thought possible. But I felt like the massage definitely helped clear me. It was good for us to work and focus on our bodies. Things were getting serious. The numbers were starting to add up and little things could start to take their toll.
I thought again and again about the bear. Most importantly what to learn. I feel that every wildlife situation should be approached with true caution for the animal and your sake. In this case, we were fine but I feel like better precaution would have been appropriate. I am thankful that our paths crossed and then released. But more caution next time. Ok...

As we made our way towards it, we started to hear massive thunder. But didn't think too much of it as we were thinking more about ice cream. Got to the ice cream place. Ishmael had a root bear float and I had a raspberry sorbet shake. Mmmmm. That was tasty. But the storm we could now see in the distance smashing the valley below us while the thunder sounded even more daunting. Quick weather check, looks like it should pass us. We gathered our things and set off, about 2 more miles till camp. The thunder continued and we noticed a few drops so we threw our pack covers on and kept pushing forward. Next thing we know, the floodgates open wide and the storm is dumping water on us. And I mean dumping. Instantly we were soaked. The trail was a small river we were now climbing and every time we thought the rain was too much it got thicker and heavier. We were running down the trail now. Our shoes were soaked to the core as we were smashing through puddles as we made our way. The thunder was two seconds. Then four. Then, I looked up, saw a lightning strike, and then immediately heard the thunder. The storm was directly over us. That strike had been somewhere in the vicinity, really close to us. We were laughing and romping through the woods like kids. Again lightning. Two seconds thunder. Maybe the storm was moving away. Again lighting, immeadiate thunder. This time I looked up and saw electricity zoom back and forth above us along with the most wild sound. The power of this storm right above us. Izzy turned to me and yelled, ""Are we in a movie?!"" We kept running. We came to a summit and an open crossing over rocky scrambles. The thunder had subsided and the storm was waxing but we weren't sure what to do. Gray skies above us. I crawled to the top of the scramble we were at and peered over. It was an open crossing for sure but it seemed like the time to go. We pushed across the open rock scrambles and slippery, slippery rocks. But we moved. Our minds told us it was important to get out of there. And we did. Back in the woods and off to the shelter. Eventually we made it. Soaked to the bone but in good spirits. We set up camp and relaxed for the night. Another day ahead of us tomorrow.","NYC

Thankfully trail angles were dropping off water jugs at road junctions. Really saved us. Whenever we needed water, there it was. We were going to push and do 14 but just didn't make the miles in time. So we crested the last hill for the day and found a sweet stealth campsite. Made dinner on some rocks and watched the sun set. Getting comfortable and really starting to find our groove even when things don't go as planned. I think we also realized, there really is no plan.

Tell you what though, Nee York water stinks. It's all yellow or red and smells bad and tastes bad. Love the climbs (lots of ups and downs and some serious scrambles) but look forward to better water. 
Camped at a really sweet shelter and spent time with our new friends and some old. It's really amazing how you speed up or slow down on the trail and end up hiking with different folk. And then randomly, you'll see someone you haven't seen in a week or even a month.

From the ridge before we got there, we could see it fully and it is a gorgeous mountain. Up and down we went. Then we met High Life (the champagne of hikers as he proclaimed himself) and we walked together a while. He was walking the AT for the third time. Interesting dude and from MA. We hitched a ride into town together and grabbed some breakfast sandwiches. After that, we parted ways and made our way back towards the trail and towards a food mart to resupply. Then we met Joe. He walked towards us as we came down the street and asked if we were hiking. Of course we said yeah and explained we were in town to get food for the next few days. We told him we were heading to the food mart and he said that was a shame. So he offered to drive us to a grocery nearby. We obviously accepted. Got to the grocery store and he came in and shopped with us. Talking the whole time. He was seriously a swell guy, like the kind of dude you actually want to be like. From the grocery store, he brought us to a pie store (Ishmael was in heaven) and then gave us a full tour of West Point Academy, where he was employed as a Chaplin. After the tour, he drove us back to the trail and we pack our food up and started hiking again, now in the rain. 
It's a wild feeling to get your gear together and start walking up a mountain in a rainstorm. It's empowering knowing most people would be walking the other direction. I hope I remember that feeling and carry it with me always. Take the road (or trail) less traveled.","West Mountain Shelter

So he says to meet him at his campsite in a few. We relax a couple more minutes and then head over. He makes us coffee, egg sandwiches and even let's us have some pie, all the while just talking about the trail and life in general. But mostly trail. A lot of people that have always wanted to do this help those on the trail by doing little things like this. This Joe camps here one week on and then one off and just finds hikers and makes them breakfast or lunch. Amazing. Well, said goodbye to Joe and moved on.

At the deli, ordering breakfast sandwiches like there's no tomorrow. They are delicious. Grab some more snacks to help make it to our next destination. Get ourselves a ride from a super friendly dude who turns out to be a boy scout leader. Drops us off at the trail head and it's time to hike. Instead, we eat the other breakfast sandwich we had ordered. Mill around a bit and then head off. Make it to the first road crossing after singing our song on the boardwalk for Crazy Tree and seeing a couple snakes along the way. 
At the Garden Center, we stop again. Turns out to be a pretty lazy morning. Eat some more food and buy a few more snacks. Crazy Tree got a mail drop and sorts through his stuff. In the meantime, we meet Dance the Hiker and Pole Runner. Two younger dudes but very cool guys. After hanging a bit we all start hiking...till we see a food truck about 50 feet down the road and stop again. Lunch time. Waste another hour chilling and eating. Now we find out it's Dance's birthday. So we sing happy birthday and finish our food. Finally time to hike again. 
As we start our first mile, we (Izzy, Dance, Pole and I - Crazy Tree's pack is heavy from the resupply) decide to get to this gas station and crank out a few beers to celebrate. Problem is it's about 3:30 and the place closes at 7 and we have about 11 miles to go. Well, we go. Made it to the gas station by 6:45. Hiked faster than we have up until this point and even kept up with a couple of NOBO's. Turns out the guy running the Gulf is super friendly and says we can hang at the picnic table outside the store as long as we want. So we do. We sit there brown bagging beers till about 9pm, just talking and laughing and enjoying each other's company. Dance has a great time. We saunter across the street and find a nice place to camp right in town kind of out of sight and on a beautiful lawn. Set up tents talking gear now and getting ready for bed.

Breakfast sandwiches and Gatorade and coffee and rice crispy treats. Breakfast of champions. Headed back out and got a ride from a nice gentleman that Ishmael was chatting with. Saved us .4 back to the trail. Crazy Tree joined us as we cruised back. 
Back on trail, met up with Mafia and realized that the storm was about to hit. A little rain so we threw our pack covers on. But then nothing. We trudged along for another 20 minutes or so and then it hit. Buckets poured down on us again. After the last wild storm, we weren't too concerned. Lightning and thunder rumbled in the distance but there's always a chance that it could get closer. Made it to the first shelter of the day and took a break. We were all soaked. Another 10 miles or so to go, maybe it was 7. Mafia stayed back but the rest of us pushed on, knowing full well that we were about to head into more of the storm. 
For about an hour or so, nothing. The sun even came out. We teased the storm, asking if that was all it had. And then the rain came back. We had 5 miles left before we hit a road crossing and we had made a plan for all three of us to crash in a hotel room. This time, it really poured. We were drenched through and through. At one point, lightning struck within a mile of us. We all looked at each other in awe as we headed directly towards where the bolt had hit. 
There's really nothing like pushing through a thunder storm. You're soaked. You pack is heavier with all the weight. Every rock you crawl over is a slippery disaster. But you deal. You deal with the small pond in your shoes. You just deal. This is why I came out here. To toughen up. Well, ok. Let's get tough.

Well, we hit it again, practically sprinting at points to make it across this ridge before we and the rocks get soaked. Storm never hits but we get to the summit and enjoy a moment of rest while we meet Prometheus and Funky Duck. Seem like nice dudes and turns out they are also Flip-floppers.

Had to stop every few feet because it was just breathtaking. Made it up Everett and that was a climb. Over 1,000 feet of elevation in a half mile. Crested the summit and came down the other side only to find trail magic. Water! We needed it. Sat down to hang with Mafia (who just so happened to be there) and our trail angel came along with cake too! So she joined us for a slice while we chatted about the trail and her experience with it.

After breakfast, we stand across the street and I pick up a hitch in about 5 minutes. Really nice girl who also hikes. She brings us down the road and we're back on trail.

Or maybe we really just want to lay around for 15 more minutes. There really isn't any deadline besides a maildrop you need to get into town for or a friend you need to catch up with. So we start around 7:30. Thinking about trying to hit 20 miles today. Finish 5 in no time and sit down to have breakfast.

Renting a car from the trail- not easy. 45 minutes or so and two rental companies and four dropped calls later, I text my brother and ask for a favor, when I finally find service. Within 15 minutes and another half mile of trying to find service again, he lets us know he can get us. This is all because around noon today we found out the funeral is Friday. It's Wednesday now, so we just want to be off trail tonight. With this all in mind, we start moving with purpose. As we near the last couple of miles, we start to slow down. We're tired and when your body knows it's about to take a break, it longs for one. Everything feels exhausting, your pack gets uncomfortable and you start counting minutes. At just about this point, Billy Goat swings through. We had bumped into him the day before so we strike a convo for a second. Realizing he's cool peeps, he sets off at a raging pace and we follow right along. It's pretty funny, jogging down a trail and having convo at the same time. It all really starts to feel like Lord of the Rings. Somehow it gets even more epic. It's also starting to occur to me what this all really is. It's a backpacking trip, yeah, but it's really a very long endurance race. Putting in 15 miles a day is not leasiurely walking through the woods. It's moving 2-3 miles and hour which still sounds slow. But...it's not. This is an extreme activity as one hiker we met once said. 
Well, we're off trail in no time. Say farewell to Billy Goat. He hiked all of CT in a day and a half so we may never see him again.

I had images before I started this journey. One of my deepest longing was to create music that has the essence of water. Water is soothing and constant. Where it flows it erodes. It is powerful. Sitting on that rock today thinking about some music I am writing, it came together in a new way. Realized what needed to happen with the melodies and how they interchange. 
Eventually we hiked on. We hike much faster now, sometimes in bursts, but always at a decent pace. We're even pushing up hills better. Made it to camp with ample time to just enjoy the evening.

It took two months of me pushing through the woods to see that today. We went through our first wilderness. And we walked here. And we hit 600 miles.","

We set off and pace ourselves all day. Upon reaching the peak, there is another fire tower with another incredible view. Those moments make all the hours worth it. And thinking about this task. We push so hard, doing something we sometimes wonder why and the payoff is health and perspective. I'm sure at the end of all this that lesson will spill over into a million things. We make all the miles we wanted to. It's about 7:30. We find an amazing stealth site near the shelter trail. Just the two of us by a river for the night.

Left it in our tracks. Or rather, the storm passed on to somewhere else. Catch a hitch into town. Back of a pickup truck. First time that's happened. Fun times. Eat an amazing breakfast No.2 and then head to the local outfitter. No lightweight tents but they specialize in footbeds. Ishmael sits down with the doc there and he hooks her up with something new. Trying to figure out foot pain is pretty much your number one goal on the trail. Ishmael has tried about four or five different insoles and nothing has really worked for her. She's ecstatic about these. Even talking about coming back again. We call the Hostel dude and he comes to get us. Very cool Hostel. Tons of trail stuff all over the walls. Even gives us a beer before calling it a night. We go through our things and get our food settled. We decide to get a ride into town tomorrow and head back to the outfitter.

So pumped. Head of to town and the Mountain Goat Outfitter. We arrive and immediately one of the women there helps me out. We talk about the pains I'm experiencing and she asks what I have for an insole. I show her and she is not into it. Calls it flimsy, which they have been. My heel has felt all over the place. She tried a harder insole and it feels awful. Then we try a different one and something starts to blow me away. My foot is being propped up in a way that is helping a part of it that has actually started to cave in. I'm flabbergasted. She shows me how my muscles were working and shows me now how they will be working. My toes don't feel crammed.

He's excited to help us out and it's inspiring to meet him. Said he'd been out since Feb. They drop us off and we start climbing.

I walked around for about a half hour before I realized it. I was rather perplexed actually. Not sure if it was because we only did 10 miles or if it's because of the insoles. Time will tell. Not planning on having a very rough day at all today. Fix oatmeal before we leave and then head down to the pond to relax a minute. That's when we officially meet Dave from New York. We're both sitting there a while taking in the pond and conversation just starts. Conversation is very natural amongst hikers. Even if it's just a few words, almost everyone talks a little when crossing paths. Anyway, we hang for a while talking about the trail and the last few days. Turns out he's section hiked almost as much as we've done so far. It's funny how instantly that lets us bond. We hang for like an hour maybe an hour and a half. Finally we say see ya later and head over to pack up. We get our gear together and eventually the packs go on. We're both a little nervous about our feet and are still trying to figure out the new shoes. They have a crazy lace system. But tweak after tweak is helping me get a handle on it. You secure the top of the shoe, then grab the tension at the place above that and then grab the tie right next to the tongue. Pulling back at an angle similar to the shoe, you finally tighten up the area above the lace which holds your heel. A few more days and it will really make sense. 
We take break after break to snack today. We're really hungry and taking our time with our feet seems to really help. If we correct this, then the rest of the trip is based on our better technique. Crazy to repeat one motion you know so well, so many times and then find out you're actually just hurting yourself. My foot had caved in slightly and this was helping to get the shape back together. It will take time the doc said. Hopefully not too long. 
One break is by a river. There's a shelter there, so we put our packs down. We scurry along some rocks to the river and find our own personal little spot. This place is amazing. There are so many areas for people to hang out and even feel secluded along the same river. We sit down, take of our shoes and socks and let our feet soak for a while. It feels unreal. A faster section even feels like a whirlpool. We hang for a while just enjoying ourselves.

And ready to climb. Good thing because it's a long way up this trail. 5038 feet. You hit three peaks on the way up to Washington and it's 12 miles from the roads. We climb all day. Beautiful view after beautiful view. Every time you stop, it's just another wonderful place to take in what's around you. Our mood is high. We hit tree line and get to Lake of the Clouds hut. This is the place apparently. There must be 70 people up here and the dining room is abuzz. Thru hikers are sitting about waiting for the remains of dinner and the shot at a place to stay. We want nothing of this. It's getting late but we decide to go further anyway. Seems we could have the mountain to ourselves. And we do. We summit around 7:30 pm and the top is in a cloud. It's freezing. We huddle next to one of the buildings up there and find some cover from the wind. Dinner time. After dinner it's time to move on. Further down the ridge we go. It's dark now and the clouds lift just enough for us to see around us. We through our headlamps on. We heard there were some stealth sites along the jewel trail so when we reach it, we descend. This trail is rough. Jumping from rock to rock down the side of the mountain. We must enter tree line 4 times as each time we do, the trees recede again and we just see more rock. Finally we're back in a forest and a little further we find somewhere to call home for the night. Dinner that night below the stars will be something to remember forever.","US Route 302

Neo agreed to take the blue blaze with us. At first, we asked to blue blaze straight through, which means skip a small portion of the AT by using a blue blaze (like a bypass). I would never do that to just skip a section of trail, only to see something really great as long as I traveled as far as the actual AT. Neo was not about the bypass. So we agreed to blue blaze up and back. So off we went. Up at the top was a mass of people. Seemed like 50 or more hikers. Even a crew of peak baggers, like 20 of them. We had to sit in line for our pic at the summit while everyone made comments and stared at you. Not as much fun as having the place to yourself. Still, I had to hit that peak. We had tried to tackle it for my bachelor party a year prior and hadn't made it all the way. So today, it was a triumph. We headed back to the AT and onward. Navigating the presidential ridge is a challenge. Most of it is bouldering, nothing really dangerous but it was great weather. So visibility was fine.  It was awesome. My body was destroyed though. But you keep on going. We finally made our way to Madison and Ishmael and I felt a full circle. Even more so as we lunged down the trail. That trail is a beast. Rock scramble where there is no actual right way. You just sort of pick a path and hope you're on the right one. One bit, a downhill section, is like 500 ft almost vertically down. When heading downhill, it just feels like you're leapfrogging down a cliff of hard, unforgiving rock. It's both awesome and so brutally mashing. We arrived at Osgood tentsite and felt like pressing on. I knew about the Bluff. We had stayed there on our first journey and it was maybe .5 further. We decided to hit it and got there in a flash along the flat, easy trail. It was just as I remembered it but with toilet paper. Someone recently had camped there and just left paper on the ground everywhere. Please, don't do this. I've seen it all too often. Bury it or bring it out with you. Don't leave it on the ground. Besides that, it was such a sweet spot. And really brought us back. We slept well that night. Wildcats tomorrow.","Stealth down Jewel Trail

I feel confident in each foot I place in front of the next. I feel solid and like the ground and I are connected. 
Filmed today but there was a smudge in some of the vids. Wish I had just remembered to wipe the camera. Always do that. Capturing our journey is a real treat. Still trying to find the best place to put the GoPro while filming but it's good to get a few different angles. So curious to see if I can make anything of this when I get a chance to edit.

Well, met is maybe the wrong term. He just kind of sat near us at the summit. Right before he took off, as we were also leaving, he turns to us and says in this like grim reaper voice, ""Have fun getting to Katahdin. It's nothing but up and down rock."" Then he grunted away.

It appears the design is exactly opposite. Tonight I am laying in my tent quite comfortable. It's the little things that count.

They only allow 12 thru hikers daily to stay at the thru hiker site. This allowed us to not have to worry at all. Definitely a relief. Before making our way out to the campsite, we met Sweatheart, a German thru hiker, and JD, a LASH. LASH is short for long @$$ section hiker. Both super cool dudes and offered to have us over to hang before turning in for the night. So once we got it all together at the campsite, we headed over to hang. They brought a couple of beers out so we had one and also had some rehydrated humus. Too good. It was amazing. With Fritos. Killer combo. Eventually it was far too late and we headed home.

Detour,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578525,"5 am rolls around. We start to budge. By 5:30 we are rolling up sleeping pads. Trying to get an early start. Make it on trail by 7:30 after a nice oatmeal starter special. We ditch a lot of our belongings and go for a lighter pack today. I'm going to film so the GoPro is with me and rain gear. Rations for the day. The basics. We hit the trail. After a few minutes I go into rage mode. I'm so excited to see what this is all about, I race up the first 2,000 feet or so. Must pass 16 people on the way up. Finally break tree line and the camera comes out. Izzy and I start the real meat of the climb. It's pretty wild at times but nothing ridiculously challenging. A lot of actual climbing though, like they said there would be. Once above the climb, you can see the summit from a mile out as you head along the ridge. 
At the summit, a lot is flashing before me. Over 1100 miles to get here. So far. Such a dream. And so far to go but for now we celebrate and the view is magnificent. The best view in Maine they say and I would believe it. But in the background, lurks the real challenge. The Knife Edge stretches on in front of us in all its glory. We sit for 40 minutes or so having some snacks and prepping for the next part of the show. Emram gives me some final pointers. She's done it before and says most of its not too wild but mentions Pamola and the Chimney. They are two peaks in the distance we can barely see. She says that might get us a little. She says the whole thing is exhilarating. Well, we shall see. 
We finally set off, make it maybe 30 feet and JD yells for us. He asks if it's ok to come along. We say sure! The more the merrier. And we set off together. Well, at first the ridge is rather wide. It looked crazy at points but so far it's just beautiful. Every now and then you get rather close to the edge and you realize you are walking next to shear cliffs on both sides. Like almost straight down for 3,000 miles. It's awesome. Then, it starts getting narrow. I walk with confidence. For the last four months I have been envisioning this moment. Been prepping and I am ready. It is glorious. Then we start climbing. Before we know it, we are at the peaks. We ascend the first one and as the second climb comes into view, so does the current one. Across the way I can see blazes going up a cliff. As I look forward, I have to look down because that is where the trail goes. I think JD and I go a little white as Izzy bravely climbs out before us. I've been climbing for sections but this is like 100 feet. When you realize there is no where else to go but forward, you go. One foot after the next. One hand hold to the next. We make our way down. I was terrified but confident. I hit the ground and JD motions for a break. Izzy climbs back down (she had already started the next section) and the three of us munch on GORP. I'm shaking. But not just with fear. My adrenaline is pumping. Now it's a climb up. Up is easier. You don't look down as much. You just go up and forward. We nail it and we're all on the peak. A moment of bliss. Then we realize we have to walk down the mountain. We're tired but we push onward. A couple hours later we're in a car and heading home for the week. Cat and Tyler found us. Ty couldn't believe how ridiculous my beard is. It's long now. We've been at this a while.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Met three people hoping to thru hike one day and chatted quite extensively with them. Firestarter was a younger dude, very chill and hoping to triple crown in one fell swoop. That means he's going to walk all three long trails one right after the other. Lofty goal. He's seems incredibly pumped for it though and we tell him loads of stories. Eventually we say goodbye. The other two were a couple we met maybe an hour later. We dove deep into it with them, explaining as much as we could in the time we shared. The roller coaster has been fun.

Somehow I manage to squeak out one more hour of rest as I sink repeatedly into the ground. I was mad. Like ultra mad. Made me think of gear. Gear failing when you need it. But here, gear is survival or comfort or both. The ground is very cold. Touching the ground for a while at night...cold. I get up and go about my duties. First thing, I find the hole. Thankfully I do. I put seam sealer on it and let it dry, which takes almost three hours. We have breakfast. Make wraps for lunch. Relax. Can't fight it. It's what it is. After what seems like dry enough, I put patch tape over the sealer and roll it up. Into the pack and off we go.

I look over and see a rather large bear raise his head and stare at us. I say to Iz, ""Do you see..."" We both stop. We look at the bear. He looks at us. Staring at us. Doesn't stop. Izzy starts to move on, slowly. I continue as well. The bear still stares. I stop and look back. I don't stare. I don't want to aggravate it. It's maybe 400 pounds. If it stood up, he would be taller than me. He doesn't flinch. He just stares. Seconds seem like minutes. Finally I talk to it and bang my sticks a little. Izzy stops and joins me. The bear immediately looks away and continues to forage. We start walking again. Every few feet I turn around and look for a moment.  We seem to be ok. We hike on. We make it to a campsite.

Detour,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581035,"We were shooting for double twenties. My leg gave out around mile 17 today. Since I switched my insoles, my leg has been figuring out how to work properly. On the downhill sometimes it overworks the tendon that I believe is working my lower leg. Stress from downhill and extreme ups and downs seem to give me trouble. When we first started the flop the first day was really bad with this. Then after the double zero we took it did the same thing. With all the climbing over the last two days and the many, many feet of downhill, yeah, at mile 17.5, it was done. I was reduced to a hobble and was using my trekking rods as a crutch. For a mile and a half we went on. But we got 40 miles in two days. I'll get my revenge. By the time I got to camp, it was ok. I could walk fine. Any up and down would cause it to flare up again but I'm going to sleep now. 
Izzy and I had a rough day. This isn't easy. Just past 1500 miles and I feel like I'm falling apart. I came out here to find a better person in myself. I think I'm tougher, stronger, more durable and probably other things. But I'm not sure if I'm a better person. I don't know how that happens. How we get so lost in ourselves and unable to find the things we need or want again. I feel like one day, a long time ago, I went into a basement and got lost. I think I came out here to get a little less lost. That hasn't happened. I think the only thing to change or that will change will be the rest of my life and what I do with it. That may be the only power we really have and even that power does not belong to us all. I'm going to keep seeking this out. This better person thing. I've got a month and a half or so and many more miles. 700 miles is very far. I do like this tent site though. Nice camp and I found a little passage in the back that led to another site and a secret little tucked away spot. Maybe that's what I need to find in my heart.
