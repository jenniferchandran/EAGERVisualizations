Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542638,"I purposely posted this note under ""preparation"" because, just like that, I have a potential hiking partner for fall 2017. Yep; it's my nephew Jason, who is a true adventurer and mountaineer. He has climbed hills in S. America, been to the Himalaya, been through an avalanche (just a bloodied face, thankfully), and gone all over the planet looking for fun and adventure. He hiked the Milford Trek in NZ a few years ago. So why not stay local and see what the AT has to offer? He thinks he might be able to get 2 weeks a year from this fall. We'll start at route 17 in Maine and head south so he'll get to finish the southern Maine hills and traipse across the whites. And I get my hiking companion. Well I am just perfectly stoked!!AND I'm working on my stepson to join me next March for a trip someplace on the southern AT for a week or so. How can this get more perfect?? Now I'll have to begin another AT hiking page in the journal: 2017 AT. To celebrate, Jason, my daughter Ariel, and Ariel's fiance Ryan will go up Mt. Washington this coming Friday. We have space reserved at Lakes of the Clouds and, despite the forecast of fog and rain, we'll have a blast. I'm a happy hiker.",,Oh Happy Day!,"Jul 18, Mon",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553001,"Well the calendar has done it again and we face another year. YAY!! I think '17 is gonna be a good year. And all of this despite catching a rotten cold that soon became rotten bronchitis. I've been out of the woods for over a week at this point and starting to feel restless. I've heard from my favorite adventuers - Bear Belle is in love and has found her man has the adventure gene too. They have kayaked the Missouri from the headwaters down to Missouri and will pick up the paddle again soon this spring as she seeks to sell her house and follow her dreams. Mrs. Joy is thinking about a thru and has invited me to join her as I am able. Maybe this year or maybe next year - to be determined. Last fall I applied for a grant to map the hiking trails in our neck of the woods - the Wendell State Forest - and haven't heard back yet. In preparation for that award I'm learning the ins-outs of the Gaia GPS app. That project should keep me busy this winter, assuming I survive this virus! My husband broke his ankle this past fall and has been on crutches for 6 weeks now. To top it off I seem to have infected him with my cold. Now that's love. This month I begin to train slowly and progressively for what I hope is a series of hikes on the AT in NH and Maine this year. I'm hoping for maybe monthly week long stints. That should make it easy on me, what with my grandson due in April and my harvest duties in July and the needs of my ""dog and pony"" (literally) show. I won't go north until at least June. If Mrs. Joy starts her thru this year I'll try to start in May, maybe late April too. We'll see. Lots of movin' and shakin' and I feel the excitement. I have to make some alterations to my tent - have all of the materials now - in order to have it perfect, so this winter I have plenty of things to keep me occupied. Feelin' pretty happy!",,'17,"Jan 06, Fri",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554050,"I'm so lucky to live here. Our home is walking distance to the Wendell, Montague, and Leverett State Forests and the Quabbin Reservoir, with hundreds of miles of woods roads and trails. There is hiking, cross country skiing, snow shoeing, ice skating, ice fishing, hunting - you name it. It is literally paradise! 
I was out today to explore some trails and take mileages for my Map The Woods project and ended up cruising around for over 3 hours. I didn't get any useful data, but logged in close to 8.5 miles of fun. The footing was sweet; a light snowfall last night on top of a few inches of frozen sleet made for some fabulous tracking. A few days ago when I was just bushwhacking through the laurel and pine I ended up following some moose tracks for a spell. Today I passed a section of very fresh bobcat tracks - Ruby even put up her hackles and glued herself to my side so I knew the critter was nearby. The tracks were big. I bet that cat was a good 40 pounds which is as big as Ruby.
I'm happy with my fitness at this point. This is the second longer walk I've taken recently and have had no issues with my joints, other than a bit of arthritis pain in my ankle. I can easily make the distance, but I'm not carrying any weight or taking any long/steep climbs, so I know it's all honeymooning.
My hiking buddy Amy is heading out for a flip flop thru in April and I will be starting with her. While I won't be able to swing a thru I am hoping to meet up with her for a week each month for the extent of hers. That's so exciting!
And Cato Glen Shepardson is the name of my new grandson, due April 7, but don't tell anyone! His name is a huge secret for some reason, so mum's the word! And THAT'S so exciting!!

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555833,"Wow. It has been so warm that the two feet of snow melted away, the trees have begun to bud out, and bird romance has been on the rise. Well it's clearly Spring!! Ooops. Then came the wind. Roaring and raging, the wind brought in a front cold enough to freeze sound waves in the air. It was fierce. Beyond fierce; more like lethal! On those days it's possible to get out and hike, but it's important to layer up. So on went the silk base layer, the wool long johns, the sweatshirt and two (count them!) lightweight jackets. Ops. Don't forget the wool buff and the thick polar fleece hat. Sunglasses keep the eyes from watering constantly. All set to go! 
Well, off I went, dog in tow. We actually had a great hike - a simple 5 miler that kept to the woods trails to avoid the blisteringly cold wind. But that was then, and now it's promising to warm into the 50s tomorrow. OK. So I pare down the layers once more and enjoy the warmth. Wooohoooo!
Actually I've been busy plugging in my new dehydrator and experimenting with heating the fluid out of foods. It's really really neat! So far I've transformed 4 apples, a banana, a couple pounds of chicken breast, a bunch of celery, some pea sprouts, and even some yogurt. The review: forget the plain yogurt. BUT mix the yogurt with some jam and it becomes a high protein fruit leather. YUM!! I used my home made black currant jam. I think I'm on to something great. Really.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557570,"Out for a hike today to test some gear. I put in a lumbar pad in my ArcBlast pack for added comfort and it felt great. Took my DIY poncho for a spin as well since it was raining. The poncho did fine, but I got as much condensation inside as with any other rain equipment, which was disappointing. By the time I got home - only 5 miles later - my polar fleece was as wet as if I'd just been walking in the light rain without any poncho. Even my pack was damp from condensation. Not sure how to address that. If anyone has any ideas, I'm eager to hear.For some reason, as I slid along the slushy, icy, snowy trail, I began to remember the hallucinations I had during my long hikes. Let me first say that, no, I wasn't taking any medications or strong alcohol, or even weak alcohol. But on two of my distance hikes, both in VT on the long trail, I could swear I smelled hot dogs grilling. And I mean GREAT hot dogs. Beefy and juicy and so yummy. This was a real, true, hot dog aroma. It was great, only, no hot dogs for miles! Either that or there really WAS somebody there, grilling up some dogs and staying tantalizingly out of sight. Do elves eat hot dogs? Maybe....Then last spring on my Maine journey on the AT I was in a shelter at the end of the day during a monsoon and I could hear people talking as the rain pounded down on the shelter's metal roof. Unlike the hot dogs, that hallucination was actually sort of creepy.For all of these mental entertainments I've been completely solo. Maybe TOO solo!I wonder what the trail will do for me this year?",,Hallucinations,"Mar 25, Sat",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558342,"Having a little moment here. With snow falling again, roads and trails covered, and spring warmth just a vague meteorological concept, I find myself faced with a bad case of frustration. I can feel the conditioning I'd build up just draining out of my body. By April 1 I'd expected to start some more serious hill work; now I'll be slogging through the slush and slipping around the lowlands. Grrrrr. Oh yeah! I forgot; flexibility - mental flexibility - is the foundation of every distance hike plan. OK. Suck it up. Sigh. Put on the boots and start slogging. Grumble grumble grumble... 
Post Script: went out for a few hours. Light freezing rain turned to snow by the time I was finishing. It was a good workout because of the slippery footing; two steps forward and one step back sort of thing. It was not too cold and not too windy and just a total relief to be moving. Motion is perfection. Wet feet, soaked to the skin, happy, glad to be out and moving and feeling the natural world at it's seasonal nexus. Ahhh!",,The Big Stall,"Apr 01, Sat",0

My daughter produced a wonderful healthy 9 pound, 21.5 inch baby boy yesterday afternoon of a lovely spring day. Mom and baby doing great! And the baby is the cutest baby on the planet, and I'm not exaggerating. So today was to be my departure date to drive to PA then get the shuttle to MD, but all that will delay a bit now.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563138,"I can't say that I got a great night's sleep last night.  I'm excited about the hike and anxious to get going.  It's been such a fabulous few weeks; Jer and I have been busy at home with building projects, Ariel and Ryan have welcomed little Cato into the world, and the hike is starting.  I feel like I've been focusing in twelve different directions at once.
There is something freeing about driving out first thing in the morning.  I'm saying goodbye to all of the routines of my home life and in a single day I'm starting up a second set of routines.  Hiking is such a condensed life.  You carry your life on your back, except for the new friends you meet and the thoughts of home you keep in your heart.  It is life simplified.  You wake up,dress, eat (maybe), hoist on your pack, and start walking.  The walking thing lasts all day.  Easy peasy.  Then you get to your destination, get your water, set up your tent, eat, clean up if possible, chat with your trail-mates, and by 8 or 9 pm you are sleeping.  If you are lucky you hear the rain pass during the night as a round of comforting splats on your tent roof and then it's over and dry by morning.  And a day of rain might be your biggest worry.  
Perfect.
But today there is traffic and roads and I'm in my little '04 Insight to save on gas and realizing this little car is NOT build for comfort, but for saving fuel.  I am feeling every pebble and after several hours and finally getting to PA I pull into a Friendlys to grab some lunch.  Wow.  I'm stiff all over.  The plan is to get to Fayetteville to meet up with Mrs Joy and hike north with her for about 5 days and then drive home.  The devil is in the details - I finally get to Fayetteville and arrange to leave my car at the hostel for the duration.  I'll sleep in the Scottish Inn tonight - Mrs Joy has a room there as well - and tomorrow we start north.",,The beginning,"Apr 25, Tue",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563145,"OK.  Another restless night of non-sleeping.  Oh well.  Too late to worry about that; today is trail day!!  Wooohoooo!!  I'm up and enjoying cleanliness for possibly the last time in several days.  Mrs Joy and I set out to the hostel where owner Robert gathers us up along with You Can Call Me Al for a quick skip to the trailhead.  The trail is only a mile or so down the road but it's nice to be shepherded since the road is busy with fast cars and trucks.  We are at the trail in a matter of minutes and then on our way! I spend some time fumbling around, trying to get oriented to my new routine.  Where do I put my bandana?  Which pocket is my snack stash in?  What did I forget?  It's an awkward transition for me - I feel disorganized and inept.  I'm also woefully unprepared.  I've completely forgotten to bring my AWOL guide sheets and while I had a copy of the AT companion I just left it behind in my car.  Duh.  That was the first time I've ever done that and it will certainly be my last.  But the legs swing forward and back and the trail slides under my feet, and beyond the roughness of my start I feel happy.  Mrs Joy is a good companion.  I began to marvel at how two hikers who typically hike solo can mesh so well when paired up.  Good.  It's nice to chat away the miles.  I'm certainly not at my finest, though.  I feel wiped out even though the trail is very reasonable and hiker-friendly.  It winds through a woods, makes gradual ups/downs, courses through a short stretch of rhododendron that completely overhangs the trail such that it forms a tunnel of growth.  The day was wonderfully foggy and cool, so hiking was at its best.  No sun to burn, few bugs to bite.  I am tired, out of hiking shape, but happy.In at the shelter we meet up with Sqeptiq (Sceptic, but with q's instead of c's), Sea Dog, Hot Pants, Go, and Trail Snail.  Talk was lively with these folks who are mostly flip floppers like Mrs Joy.  A beautiful stream ran alongside the shelter area and after setting up the tent I availed myself of a quick bath (of sorts) in the cool refreshing water.  It's great to get the stickiness off before hitting the sack.  I was surprised at seeing no rodents at the shelter and few animals on the trail.  No chipmunks or squirrels even.  Odd.  The weather prediction for the next day is for very hot and sunny, so as a group we were inclined to start hiking early to avoid the worst of it.  As it turned out, all of the guys ended up in the shelter on bunks and all of the women were tenting.  Hoping for a good night's sleep.  Tired to the bone.","Fayetteville, PA

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563148,"Finally!  A good night's sleep!  I woke to splat splat on the tent but knew it wasn't rain due to its lack of constant rhythm.  The water splatting on the tent was just run off from the fog that surrounded our campsite this morning.  And what a glorious morning.  Cool and damp and downhill!  I admit to being sore and stiff from the past few days.  My trail legs are more or less not there yet and my lower back was complaining.  But nonetheless I felt darn good.  I feasted on a few granola bars, packed up, and off we went.  Mrs Joy and I made conversation as we marched along, heading for the next shelter and a meal.  Well, the next shelter popped into view in just a few hours.  I happily pulled out my stove and fired up a great meal of home-concocted soup and dehydrated veggies and burger and ate every bite.  Yum!  I noticed I was the only one really enjoying a healthy meal and marveled at how much control they showed.  People were talking cheeseburger - I assumed this was just typical hiker day dreaming.  But after my ""lunch"" the trail wove down over a railroad bed and presto! Behold the Country Store!  And it was staffed by Melissa, that goddess of the grill, who was busy cranking out cheeseburgers for all of our shelter-mates. She earned a hug from my be calling me a 'young lady' as she took my order (!), and in a matter of minutes I found myself eating the second lunch in a matter of a few hours.  OK.  I can rise to that challenge!  Actually, I made it through a small mountain of fries and half the burger.  My belly was full and having a bit of trouble acclimating to this new hiking menue.  In fact, if section hikers think of a new trail name for each section/hike they undertake, my name this trip might well be Gas Bag or Poopy Pants.  After lunch we saddled up again and took off uphill this time.  The climb was reasonably gradual and the sun was struggling to burn through the fog.  I felt completely energized, despite the stomach gurgling, and managed to keep up with Trail Snail as she wound up the hill.  An interesting woman, Trail Snail is from Germany and hiking the AT is just one of several adventures she sets her sights on after spending her professional life sitting at a desk.  She carried a full pack including the biggest bear canister I've ever seen (she had once had her food supply commandeered by brother bear and vowed ""never again!"") and was not a poster girl for ultralight by any means.  She was also a strong hiker who belied the 'snail' name if it was meant to indicate slowness.  In her case, it must have meant ""I have my home on my back"".  Near the top of the hill I found the campsite that Mrs Joy and I agreed to use, but it was on a nasty side hill lie.  Mrs Joy and I pressed on, soon finding a campsite that was quite lovely and not too much farther.  We set up our tents, threw a line for our bear bags, and settled down.  I then discovered that my sleeping pad valve was leaking.  Darn.  Mrs Joy graciously offered her thin pad, and, when added to my own thin pad gave me enough warmth and cushioning to get me through the night.  Thank you Mrs Joy!!!!","Birch Run Shelter

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563577,"Well the two thin pads worked OK last night and I woke to a reasonably wonderful day.  The other half of yesterday's burger made for a decent breakfast then I was off and hiking after Mrs Joy had already departed.  The trail through southern PA is just as nice as possible; often wide with gradual ups/downs, it is well maintained and boasts some nice looking shelters.  Today's trail was one of the nicest.  I kept stopping to take pictures.  There were several spots with wildflowers and an occasional view.  Just delightful.  It made me feel like this is the perfect time to be hiking in PA and the flip floppers I was following were smart to take the trail in this manner.  I'm not sure how hiking through the southern states in July will feel for them, but this is perfection.
Not having my AWOL guide was just a dumb-ass mistake.  I was left with just my Guthook to follow, which has some serious limitations.  I didn't use it much during the day - generally no point in looking at where the blue dot has moved - but just kept putting one foot in front of the other.  The elevations on Guthook were wildly skewed by an exaggerated scale, such that it looked like we were climbing Everest on the device, while in reality we would be making a fairly gradual uphill climb.  Go figure.  There were a few places where the trail got steep but the trail engineers in PA added frequent switchbacks, so it never felt too bad.At one point the trail wound through a few hundred yards of a rock jumble.  It was a bit of a challenge.  It one point there was a long step to stretch from one point to a lower rock and I stupidly chose not to make the maneuver on my backside.  Instead I thought I could more or less 'step' to the lower rock.  I sort of made the step, but the pack overbalanced me and I went diving headfirst down to the ground.  No major damage; just some bruises.  
Mrs Joy and I leap-frogged along, and finally got to Boiling Springs where Mrs Joy had (showing excellent forethought!) got us a room at the Red Cardinal B&B.  But bed wasn't on my mind as much as beer was, and I was happy to be allowed in to the Tavern despite their sign (Proper Dress Required).  Mrs Joy and I downed a brew and a burger - OK, Mrs Joy had wings instead of a burger and phoned the B&B owners that we were ready to catch a ride ""home"". The owners are Joanne and Bill and it was Bill who picked us up.  He took us to the house where we dropped our gear, then Joanne kindly ferried me to the local WalMart where I picked up a new bright blue lightweight foam pad for $7.29.  Awesome.  Mrs Joy enjoyed a shower while I was away then it was my turn and I brought my clothes in with me, 'washed' them as best I could, and shampooed my hair three times!  Cleanliness is definitely a sacred state.","Unofficial campsite

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563581,"Last night I was fine lying down until I rolled onto my side and then I started to get some painful cramps in my back.  Muscle cramps are a problem of mine and they usually mean a restless night.  I didn't want to keep Mrs Joy awake by thrashing around all night so I slid to the floor and stretched out on the thick carpet.  Astonishingly, I slept well and never had another cramp.  
Bill and Joanne were very friendly and kept a neat, clean home.  They were extremely helpful as well, and gave us a huge breakfast in the morning.  We packed up our gear and headed out to town where we met up with Sqeptiq and Hot Pants et al.  I had a bear of a time trying to fit the new blue BULKY pad onto my pack and get things snugged down under my pack cover, out of the rain.  In the end I used my bear bag rope to tie the pad to the bottom of the pack.  It kept smacking me in the butt at first so I stopped several times to readjust the thing and make it more secure.  My stomach problems continued to haunt me, even getting worse through the day.  That issue, as well as the realization that the whole trip for me was coming to a close when I didn't want it to, made me take more and more time just stopping and enjoying the moment. I even considered stopping for the night in Carlisle, but in the end kept moving through the day.  And it was a brilliant day.  The morning rain was perfect for cooling me and trail was fabulous, winding through fields of brilliant yellow rapeseed flowers.  Truly stunning.  And there were wildflowers and wide green hayfields.  Everything was blooming and budding and bursting into spring!  It felt like all the plants were churning through a frenzy of photosynthesis,and I was breathing in their cloud of newly formed oxygen molecules.  Inhale!  Ahh!  Feel the energy!  Mrs Joy was way ahead of me but we joined up at the Middlesex Diner on PA 11.  It always feels strange to go from the relative serenity of the trail to the frantic rush of  speeding traffic and walking the short distance on the side of the highway was no different.  But the diner was great, with unlimited Pepsi and some stomach-friendly cheese quesadillas, so the shock of the traffic was well worth it.  And the Pepsi helped climb a steady uphill to a nice lookout and then on to Darlington Shelter.  We set up our tents along with several other hikers and settled down.  Food was not an option for me, but stretching out was, and the new pad was welcome.  Mrs Joy discovered an unattended fire and did the right thing by smothering it with dirt before things got out of hand.  The evening quickly moved toward hikers midnight and we were treated to a sound I haven't heard in years - the call of a bobwhite.  I think, thanks, to the Pepsi overload, I finally got to sleep around 2 a.m., but at least I got some journaling finished!","Boiling Springs

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564690,"OK.  Folks often want to know the Why of long distance hiking.  Heck, so do I some of the time!  On my walk today I came up with a possible, partial answer.  As I strode along I realized that with every step forward I was pushing back against the earth with an equal but opposite force as the one pushing me forward.  And, despite my fears, since the mass of the earth is greater than my own mass, the result of those opposing forces was to move the less massive body forward MORE than the earth was pushed backward.  And yet, there can be no doubt that the earth was being pushed backward and, in some hugely immeasurable manner, was in fact MOVING in a direction opposite to mine with each step.  And that's true of every step of every entity moving in any direction.  I suppose, if we could organize all living things to move in one direction at precisely the same moment - let's say, for arguments sake, we all move in a direction exactly opposite the rotation of the earth - it might be possible to actually measure a slight change in the movement of the earth on its axis.  And the 'so what?' of that is this:  when I am walking I am actually single-handedly (albeit imperceptibly) moving the earth.  Now THAT's a confidence builder!  And building confidence is just ONE of the many off shoots of distance hiking, with greater and greater effect the more and more one hikes.  Brilliant, don't you think?  Or is it really just a case of too much whiskey?","Still at home

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567221,"I have a fantasy that one day, on any first day of hiking, I'll arise fully rested, refreshed, with dewy skin, boundless energy, and agile, crystal clear mind.  I'll enjoy brief raconteur with all I meet before sweeping through the trail on fresh, spring-loaded legs.  Behold reality.  One brief nod to the accompanying picture should set the stage pretty well.  After managing just a few hours sleep I was gonged by the 3:45 a.m. bell.  Hardest thing to do at that hour while immersed in zombie brain:  put on toe socks. Just brutal.  I'm pretty sure I looked exactly as I felt; a train wreck in progress.  But I wrestled my clothes on and gratefully accepted the large black coffee Jerry held out.  Too early, too much, too tired.  Even Ruby gave the situation brief scrutiny before heading back to her bed.  Arrrhhhhgggg.  Somehow fumbled the key into the ignition, got on the highway and headed south to meet up with my shuttle in Kent, CT.  Driver Dave met me there just after 7:00 and together we headed to Unionville, a place completely unknown to public transportation on the NJ/NY border.  Thanks to Dave's functional mind and a helpful bit of iPhone GPS, I was deposited on an unremarkable trailhead replete with dingy gravel and broken glass. Oy.  A small group of cigarette smokers congregated near their cars just downhill of the trailhead and I began to hope they weren't heading out into the natural world for the weekend and end up in my destination shelter loaded with brewskies and butts.  Wait.  Don't stereotype.The trail itself was well used and not terribly scenic but it led inexorably onward, flashing the occasional white blaze.  It didn't take long to reach a section of the Wallkill Game Reserve where I was treated to several lovely benches overlooking a man-made marsh.  A system of levees created habitat of differing water levels suitable for various species of wildlife.  Canada geese predominated, with a splashing of killdeer, indigo bunting, red wing black birds and even a cedar waxwing.  The trail encircled this preserve then headed back into the woods before passing, in short order, the Pochuck Mountain Shelter.  A good number of great tent sites led to the shelter, with more sites after.  It was only just after noon and I picked a nice flat spot a short distance from privy and shelter, and set up my tent.  A group of young boys with dads and leaders appeared shortly and I knew it could be an active night.  No worries.  I was tired enough to sleep through Armageddon if necessary.  They were a church group from New Jersey called the Royal Rangers out for their first night in the woods.  This was going to be fun!","Unionville, NY

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567227,"The Royal Rangers were incredible.  Maybe because half of the group left and hiked back to the Unionville area before nightfall or maybe because of the extremely calm guidance of their knowledgeable leader, the Rangers made a neat, quiet camp and disturbed no one.  Several section and thru hikers came in after them and spread out in the campsites in the evening, making the site full yet it was quiet and contained.  Breakfast was full of Mountain House eggs, biscuits, and sausage meals in a bag, but the kids cleaned up after themselves and packed their litter out.  Good campers.  I was the last one left in the campground.  The plan is to wait here for MrsJoy who is coming off a zero, but I wasn't sure when the meet would occur.  I loitered around and chatted with Peregrina (hopeful LASHer) and some other hikers until the crowd dispersed and MrsJoy strolled in around 10 a.m.  It was great to see her again!  We set off toward the next shelter, crossing another section of marsh on a day threatening rain.  We met up with Peregrina a short distance down the trail and the 3 of us joined up.  Nice company.  Stopped at a farmstand for lunch.  We shared a lunch of wildly overpriced watermelon, chips, and salsa, washed down with soda for the coolness and bubbles.  At this point we'd hiked only 5 miles and when I looked at my watch and noticed it was already 4 p.m. I felt compelled to get movin'!  I don't like hiking at night (recipe for disaster for me who can be clumsy in broad daylight) so I loaded up and set off, leaving Peregrina and MrsJoy to follow.  
The trail ran along the flats a short way before a steep uphill of several hundred feet to a lookout.  I could see little tiny people at a rock outcrop when I started the climb, looking out over the valley and enjoying the view.  The trail uphill was studded with rock steps that made the climb very nice.  A popular place, the top was crowded with people all clustered around a large pile of rocks.  It was a confusing mini mob and I just kept my eyes on the white blaze that kept heading up to what I thought was the lookout.  Evidently I walked right past the spur to the lookout, kept heading uphill along the white blazed AT, and missed the view.  Darn.  I could have gone back, but by then I just wanted to get to the shelter and knew I had another4-5 miles to go.  
I hustled.  I got there.  Andante (NoBo) and Lock(SoBo) were there - both taking LongAssSectionHikes - and since rain was in the forecast I settled into the shelter with them.  MrsJoy and Peregrina came in later - MrsJoy suffering stomach problems probably due to her McDonalds breakfast nosh from that morning.  I felt bad for them both.  We all managed to squeeze into the shelter and settled in for a night of peace and quiet.

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567392,"The morning started out foggy and damp.  It had been a long night of snore choruses.  Lock was a snore-with-each-breath wall rattler.  Andante had a much more creative salvo to add intermittently.  But we survived and the morning birdsong brought us to our groggy senses.  The morning was foggy and damp but not openly raining.  Peregrina was thinking she'd slow down a bit and hope to last longer.  MrsJoy and I headed out on a wet trail.  The views were foggy and probably fabulous on a clear day.  
We ran into Andante and DisCount on a section of bald and there, painted on the rock, was the line between NY and NJ.  We grabbed a photo of our feet gathered around the state line and then were off again, hitting a stretch of ups/downs that wound along the ridge.    
At some point the rain began to crank up.  My rain gear soon became overwhelmed and the wind picked up as well.  As luck would have it I happened to come out to a road where there was a hot dog stand advertised just up the road.  Hot food sounded perfect so off I went only to discover the abandoned hot dog stand.  But wait!  Just around the corner!  A Creamery!  OK.  So maybe they have burgers.  Or at least some hot tea.  OK.  I ended up with a dish of ice cream.  Well at least the place was warm and dry.  I waited for MrsJoy but she hadn't showed for close to an hour, so I put on my wet rain gear and headed out into the weather.  Luckily the rain quit after a few more tidal waves and the hiking helped dry out my duds a bit on my way to Wildcat.
MrsJoy and Andante were waiting for me when I got to Wildcat.  How did they get ahead of me?  Sneaky.  Ah well.  I finally got my hot meal and spread all of my wet clothes and gear around the shelter.  Decided to risk the snore-fest and sleep in the shelter to avoid more rain.  But hikers began to trickle in and so did the mosquitoes.  I tucked tail and set up my tent for a bug-free night.  In the end it was the right decision.","Wawayanda

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567395,"One of the fine things about hiking the AT with MrsJoy is that she KNOWS this trail really well.  She's thru-hiked nearly the whole trail and section hikes frequently.  It's like getting a guided tour.  She warned me that today would be a shorter day; we probably wouldn't reach the next shelter but would find a stealth site instead.  She knows what's ahead.  I don't study the guide much; I just follow the white blazes.  But it pays to have a plan.We started out at our usual 7-7:30 time frame.  A waterfall greeted us soon - a pretty fall down a steep face.  Rock steps made the trip uphill pretty easy and the trail wound through some beautiful old woods roads before heading uphill to a foggy bald.  I had told MrsJoy I'd wait for her at the top of the hill and so I sat on a rock waiting.  Andante showed up and we chatted.  He'd been having some balance issues and was not feeling his best.  At some point I mentioned that I was waiting for MrsJoy and Andante told me she was ahead.  He was sure of it.  I thought I'd kept a careful watch on the trail when I sneaked off in the woods for a pit stop.  I waited longer.  Andante pushed on.  At some point I moved on as well.  The trail was rocky and steep in places.  I could feel my legs were tired and was grateful whenever I hit the flats.  Andante was in sight after a while and we spoke again at a road crossing.  His vertigo was giving him too much trouble and he was heading to town for a break.  He later mentioned that there were a mass of ticks that swarmed the spot I'd been standing on, yet I haven't had a single tick on me.  I credit Permethrin treatments on all of my clotehs and gear for the tick-free hike I've enjoyed.I finally caught up with MrsJoy on a steep uphill and we settled in shortly for a cozy stealth.  Her cagey planning positioned us well for the next day, and gave us a rest from the challenging steepness of the day.  Thank you MrsJoy!","Wildcat Shelter

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567405,"The day started with more steep climbing up and then steep down.  We chatted our way down and finally came to two road crossings.  Navigating the first one was a dart-n-hope experience, but crossing the major highway was a safe bridge walk.  I paused on the bridge, looking down through the chain link barrier at all of the cars speeding by below.  Ah the ratrace!  My imagination let me believe that some of those drivers were looking up at us, planning their own hike in the future.  
The trail took us from the highway into the gentle hills of the Harriman Park.  It was magnificent.  Lush rolling hills of grasslands dotted with grand hardwoods in an open pattern spread out around the trail.  Just glorious.  I think I fell in love.  We hiked upward, having lunch on a bald when Andante caught up with us. after his night of recovery and delicious salmon.  The nerve!  MrsJoy and I planned to hike to William Brien and off we went, wishing Andante well.  
William Brien was a handsome shelter - a stone structure with a wooden floor and bunk beds.  It was tempting to set up in the shelter and avoid the rain, but the forecast had turned a bit more promising so we set up our tents.  Andante joined us at the shelter and a hiker named Spot who had thru'd the AT five times and was trying a section as training for the PCT until his knee started to protest.  Ah yes, the knees.  I can relate.  Surprisingly, Hot Pants showed up!  The last time I saw him was in Duncannon PA where I bought him a beer at the Doyle!  I never expected to see him again - the trail works in mysterious ways!

There was a lot of discussion about bears.  MrsJoy had read Facebook entries describing a bear event at Fingerboard shelter that involved two food bags, unhappy campers, and a well-fed bear, so we decided to skip that area and head for William Brien.Was this shelter also being visited by the marauders?  Would we be food targets for ursines?  We hung our bags - really high - and MrsJoy pointed out that my backpack, sitting alone among the rocks, was a number one target for any hiker-savvy Ursa.  Huh.  News to me.  What a newbie I am.  I thought about it and, yes, strung up a second cord and hung my pack.  Then later, stretched out in my tent, cozy and warm,  I started thinking I was just paranoid.  No bears here!  So I went out into the gathering gloom, found the pack-hanging-tree, un-hung my pack, and reinstated it inside my tent.  Good plan, right?  Well I thought so too, for about 10 minutes.  Then I started thinking about how much my home-made bug repellent made my pack stink.  Repels bugs.  But does it repel bears?  Or do they LOVE it??  Oh god.  I bet they love it.  So I climbed out of my bag, schlepped back to that far away tree and tossed the line over the same branch (4th try) to hoist up the stinky pack.  Again.  I hung it high and watched it swinging.  Sort of looked like a bad day for a very short person.  Actually creepy.

But had a great, bear-free night's sleep.","Unofficial campsite

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567433,"The funny thing about hanging my pack up high in a tree was the sound of rain on my tent first thing in the morning.  I lay there for a moment, thinking it would be great to just lay in the sack a bit longer.  The rain was light and just starting and it was somewhere in the 5 a.m. range.  But ooops.  Wait.  If I lay here while my pack is lingering out there like a bird in the tree then not only will my pack get soaked, but so will my tent.  I can't pack anything in my pack because, well, it isn't in my tent it's in a tree. 
The wheels turn slowly in the morning, but in a matter of minutes I figured it out.  With the rain pattering softly on my tent I headed out - first one up! - and collected the unmolested food bag and pack.  I got things stowed in no time and then headed for the shelter to make some breakfast.  This morning MrsJoy and I played role reversal.  She fired up her stove and made coffee while I ate a cold breakfast.  Go figure.  But those chores were soon done and we headed up a short pointless climb to get underway for the day.The rain picked up in intensity until about mid morning when I was sure it had quit for the day.  But no.  It started up again and hard, soaking into my pant legs and arms, again overwhelming my raingear.  A few hard climbs with foggy rain-lashed views of cloud cover were my reward for clambering up and down.  Darn.  The wind was getting pretty cold and strong, adding to the general feel of being stuck in a cold car wash.  I was never brave enough to fish my phone from it's secure baggie to take any pictures, so my record of that hike will be held in my minds eye only.  But it was lessons learned from the previous rainy hike that really helped preserve this day as a safe memory.After hiking ahead of MrsJoy (speed helps with warmth) and crossing another busy road like a frightened squirrel, I found myself on a wood road rising gradually toward the top of Bear Mountain where there is a fire tower.  The rain and wind nearly obscured the faint blue blaze option a short ways uphill.  So.  either climb the slippery rock face that led sharply uphill to the left or stay straight ahead on the wood road to follow a blue blaze that seemed to fade away with distance.  I didn't want to make this decision alone since going straight uphill on the white blaze would be best if done with company, for safety's sake, and if I chose the blue blaze I wanted to let my partner know.  So I turned back and hiked to the gravel road that seemed a sensible place to wait for MrsJoy. And it was, for not more than 10 or 15 minutes later she appeared above me, navigating the downhill slippery trail with - of all people - Andante!  In the time it took for them to reach me I checked my Guthook, enlarging the screen shot so that I could see, very faintly, that the road with the faded blue blaze did indeed extend around the hill to rejoin the AT.  Miracle!  We wouldn't need to risk falling on the slippery rocks to get back to the trail.  We huddled for a minute, shivering in the cold, and set off to follow the blue blaze which did indeed take us safely to the 1,000 stone steps downward to the Bear Mountain Inn.  Andante showed real pluck by marching into the inn, leaving a strong drip trail behind him, and discovered that we could be served lunch there, despite our drowned rat appearance.  And so we did.  It was very expensive, but very good.  I had a burger and beer, as did MrsJoy.  Andante settled for a classier chicken dish which looked insufficient to me, based on my personal hunger level.  And he had no beer.  What a titan of restraint!  It turned out that this particular weekend was the graduation weekend for West Point, and if we hadn't made a reservation for a room the previous day as we sat on a rock on the trail, we would be hiking our well soaked bodies up the trail to sleep in the rain that night.  But we were either prudent or lucky or both and had a room in Peekskill at the Holiday Inn Express, to which we were taken by cab in short order.  We offered to share the room with Andante and he wisely accepted.  Ah!  Warm and dry!  Two lovely words made better by experience.  We washed, did laundry, dried out, and got a decent night's sleep.  Well, I had to move to the floor once again, as I became plagued by a terrific urge to engage in kickboxing or sprinting or such.  Sigh.  Concrete floor.  I prefer wood or pine needle.","William Brien Shelter

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567436,"There is something underwhelming about waking up in a hotel room.  I prefer waking up in my tent.  But the breakfast was much better than what I could prepare.  I joined a soldier sitting at a table and we talked through our meal.  He was just finishing 23 years in the army; today was his last day.  Wow.  His life was about to take a major turn and I hoped him well with his future.  That must be an immense adjustment.  My own retirement seems pale in comparison.  Yet we all move on.
MrsJoy, Andante, and myself phoned Luis, our friendly cabbie, and got a ride back to the Bear Mtn. area - to the PO at Fort Montgomery to be exact, so that Andante could grab his mail drop.  The ride over twisting roads provoked Andante's vertigo again.  MrsJoy and I resupplied at a convenience store and let Andante get his box and get his balance again.  Then off we went, heading for Bear Mtn and the Hudson as MrsJoy stopped to tend some blisters on her feet and then get to her own mail drop at the Bear Mtn PO.  Not connecting the white blazes from the Bear Mtn Inn to the Hudson bridge meant Andante and I missed the zoo, which maybe was a good thing, since I would rather see animals in the wild than confined to zoo life.  The river was racing after all of the added rain from yesterday's downpour, but the lone sailboat chugging along downriver seemed unfazed.
After the bridge we headed uphill again to the top of thei hill where I planned to wait for MrsJoy.  The day had started wet but was gradually clearing up.  The wait was a long one and several hikers passed us.  An elder NOBO Energizer Bunny was a Scotsman with white hair and beard who claimed to be 21 years old.  Ha.  That Scottish humor!  He was clearly not yet drinking age.  A young SOBO day hiker assisted on the uphill by two huge husky dogs stopped for a long chat.  She was a Lyme survivor of 6 years and also an empty nester out for her first hike in those long sick years when she'd been essentially disabled and unable to work or maintain her marriage.  Lyme is such a rotten disease.  I swear I will never get another tick bite.  
Andante was getting restless as the minutes ticked by but MrsJoy, after a struggle to locate the PO in Bear Mtn, finally arrived.  We pressed onward, deciding to stop at Graymoor for a short day since it was pretty late by then and the next shelter was a bit far for the allotted hiking time.  
Graymoor was a gift!  Hikers can set up camp in their wide open playing field - even have a game of soccer I suppose - and take advantage of the covered pavilion, the outdoor (cold water only) shower and sink, and picnic tables.  Wow.  I headed for the shower after setting up the tent so that the brisk wind wouldn't knock it down.  Showering in cold water requires technique:  moisten skin in discreet spots, lather, then rinse quickly but thoroughly.  Repeat until all necessary spots are covered.  Towel off.  Now all of the sticky sweat is gone.  Bliss.
I'm not sure how I manage it, but given a broad flat field in which to pitch a tent, I'll find the only bump and make sure it is right under my back or my hips. Sigh.","Holiday Inn Express in Peekskill NY

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567606,"In the morning MrsJoy and I shouldered our packs and started off at our usual 7:15ish start time.  Andante was just getting moving as we were about to leave, and perhaps we'll see him again.  The plan today was to complete around 14 miles and stealth at or near the Canopus Lake.  The trail was kind to us, without too much steepness or harshness.  In fact, it was on this stretch that I finally caught a nice view of the valley below.  There were old defunct mines at one point along the trail, where some sort of mineral had been mined back in the day.  I never saw a mine entrance like you'd see in the old cowboy movies, but there were frequent huge rock piles made of baseball to football sized rocks.  It was a bit hard to imagine the miners digging here and living in the woods, but there must have been some constant activity since at one point the rocks had been piled such that they created a raised walkway that extended for maybe 0.1 miles.  The trail utilized this rock road, to my relief, and I began wishing there were more flat, easy miles made out of a rock bed in the trail ahead. Or maybe made of cotton batten or perhaps even cumulus clouds.  Sound like I might be getting tired?  In fact the strangest thing was happening to my right knee - it was clicking with each extension of the joint.  I couldn't feel it clicking - I could hear it clicking.  Each step, particularly the uphill steps, resulted in a non-painful audible click with full extension.  Odd.  My knees are typically marginal at best but I'd been really gratefully happy for my right knee since with a lot of quadriceps work, it had become much more reliable in the past year.  The clicking was worrisome.  We finally entered the State Park near the end of a long day, and walked the mile or two it took to get to the north end of the lake, about a quarter mile from the beach.  We found a good stealth spot, set up camp, then I took off to get a quick swim in before dark.  When I got to the beach there was only one person in sight; a man walking along a side road and talking on his phone.  I shed my crocs, made sure I set my phone safely on shore, and waded into the cool water fully clothed.  I reasoned that since my clothes were pretty funky I'd do double duty and rinse the sweat out of them.  So I paddled around a bit, took rinsing aim at the body parts most in need of attention, and headed back to the tent.  Nylon fabric dries fast, and I was hoping the clothes would be mostly dry by tomorrow.  We'll see.  I was pretty tired by bedtime, but stayed awake for quite awhile, listening to the sounds as the dark night gathered.","Graymoor Spiritual Life Center

I'd left my car at the town hall in Kent, CT, where I plan to pick it up and drive home.  The town clerk had asked me how long the car would be in the lot since they were planning on repaving the lot imminently.  She thought the 7-10 day window I gave her would be ok.  That window would close on Tuesday - giving me 2 days of hiking.  And it was a long holiday weekend so I figured I'd be safe to wait until Tues.  Then the brain got in the way.  Wouldn't they begin work in the morning?  There was no way I could get to Kent by Tues morning.  Hmmm.  And are the Kent pavers likely to start work on Monday, despite the holiday, in order to get the pay bump for holiday time?  Oy.  Then there was the thunderstorm forecast for Monday.  Then there was the issue of the clicking knee.  I did the thing that is possible for every section hiker:  I decided there were more reasons to be leaving the trail today than to stay the one extra day (Monday) and get rained on all day.  So I phoned the shuttle folks and arranged to have them pick me up at RPH shelter, which they did after a short wait.
I know what this return to home will be like.  My body will be home, but emotionally I'll still be hiking.  It's a very strange, emotionally bifocal view of the world that I don't enjoy overmuch.  But the die is cast.
I'm heading home.  I'll try to reconnect with MrsJoy for a notch-to-notch hike in NH and then possibly something in Maine.  July is a very difficult time for me to get away since family comes in to visit, I have a berry harvest to complete, and jam to produce.  But I hope to find a week or so...

P.S.  My first days home I had to do a fair amount of right knee rehab as it fell into some disrepair.  It's back to being as good as it gets now.  I was immediately treated to fresh moose tracks on my neighborhood walks and yesterday, walking the 1.5 miles to Wickett Pond with daughter, grandson, hubby, and dog, we were treated to the sight of a big, healthy, beautiful black bear.  The bear was standing in the bushes about 80-90 feet from us, inspecting us as we inspected it, a la the cover picture on Bill Bryson's A WALK IN THE WOODS.  Way too cool.","Unofficial campsite

But the next hiker I met as he was climbing down the hill made me smile for the rest of the day.  He was a young man wearing typical hiking gear and carrying a large SLR camera.  After we exchanged a few pleasantries he asked me if I'd mind taking his picture.  Sure!  No problem! He handed over his camera while asking did I know that this day was National Hike Naked Day.  Wow.  Didn't see that one coming!  Er, oh.  I get it.  Well, why not!  I laughed agreement and he laid bare his soul and every other part too, then hoisted his backpack for the proper hiker effect.  Got a back shot first then, yes, he turned around for me to take a picture of the Full Monty.  I suppose, in retrospect, that I must have seemed like a pretty safe bet to him - and now he has proof that yes, on this date on that trail, he was a true blue hiker dude!
Well the rest of the hike sort of paled in comparison.  The climb up Liberty went from steep to really steep then back to just steep by the time I got to the campsite.  The camp itself was a series of tent platforms perched on the slope and each platform held at least two tents.  Having a self-supporting tent was a boon here, and I wished I had my Old Reliable.  But no; this time for this hike I had a hiking-pole-and stake version that was a challenge to set up on a wooden platform.  But using rocks (oh plenty of those), my second pole, Yankee ingenuity, and a lot of time I finally got the tent up and usable.  My platform mate was Stacey and her big German shepherd Kai.  They made for good companions and we had a nice chat before hiker's midnight drove us into our bags.  As soon as I lay down I started to cramp up, forcing me to - when I could move again - make tracks to the bear box to dig out some salt packets from my food bag.  I swallowed two of them on my way back to the tent and did fine for the rest of the night.  I will remember to drink more water and electrolytes tomorrow. Caught a great sunset through the walls of my tent - blazing orange light filtering through the trees made for a lovely end to the day.","Liberty Springs Parking Area

Liberty, which rewarded me with a great view at last.  They may be tough hiking, but the Whites don't skimp on fantastic views.  I soaked up the panoramic scenery for a few minutes then figured I'd best be heading out.  Ahead of me lay Haystack, the Franconia Ridge, Lincoln, and Lafayette, before I dipped below treeline again.  I wasn't sure how difficult the hike would be, and I am slow on uphills and downhills too.  On the flats I can hold my own.
Well the trail after Liberty went along the flats for a bit and I enjoyed that part of the hike, taking advantage of the easy leg-swinging rhythm. Before long the fir and spruce gave way to open views and I was heading out on the famous Franconia Ridgeline.  Oh the beauty of that ridge!  On one side there was, in the far distance, glimmerings of civilization as tiny dot houses and barns.  On the other side of the ridge there was a vast expanse of nothing but hills and trees and sky and more and more and more.  My god I was stunned by the enormity of this place.  Such wilderness!  Such breathtaking beauty!  Everyone should get here.  See this.  Feel this.  It is transcending.  It is a spiritual explosion.
I have to admit that I sort of stumbled a bit on the ridge.  The view was so fabulous that it was hard to focus on the trail surface.  But I had to move on ultimately since my first option for rest would be a tent site around 7.5 miles from my start point.  The view was perfect and the trail was challenging.  It was an up/down/up/down trail that entered the treeline again and then became very challenging.  I moved at about 1 mph - very slowly in other words - due to the rigor of the trail.  I was tired by the time I reached the campground since I'd been hiking almost steadily for nearly 8 hours, except for the time I'd spent filtering water and drinking electrolyte solution.  The campground was a decision point.  Do I keep going and try to reach Galehead Hut?  Do I set up here and try out another tent platform?  Heavy rain was in the forecast which pushed me toward the Hut, but my energy level was hitting LOW.  I had a snack and some more water, lifted my pack, and started down the trail.  Decision made.  Now I had to live up to it.  
2.7 miles to go and I began to realize that I was struggling physically and mentally.  I kept thinking about how tired I was, how weak and shaky my legs felt, how creaky and old I felt.  It was a litany of woe, really.  This was not how to hike the Whites.  I had to change my mantra and came up with one that will probably sound ridiculous at other times in other places.  It was:  I feel young, I feel fresh, I feel capable, I feel strong.  I repeated this over and over, both aloud not.  Just over and over.  Step by step.  It worked.  The miles began to disappear without the same level of pain and distress.  I made it to Galehead Hut, about 11 hours of nearly continuous hiking, completely done and completely grateful for dinner and a bunk.  I cleaned up as best I could, ate dinner and fell into bed.","Liberty Campsite

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570313,"Slept like the dead; I don't think I moved all night and hopefully didn't snore too loudly.  Yesterday's long hike lingers on my body today.  I feel more than a little battered.  It poured heavy rain last night - I could hear that at least - and is still raining this morning.  The peak baggers are a hardy lot, I'll say that.  They are gearing up to go bag a few more this morning.  Breakfast is served, the morning skit is underway - the one that reminds us all to fold our blankets - and then it's time to push off and get moving.  The forecast is for thunder showers so I'd like to be off the ridge before that occurs.  The day starts with a climb up South Twin which is blanketed in fog and light rain.  I take a picture of the signpost pointing the way along the AT but have to keep my phone in its protective baggie to keep it dry.  Or at least partly dry.  So the picture looks bleary and wet.  The trail maintainer is up at the summit removing a hiker-made cairn.  He's placing the rocks right on the trail instead of deeper into the trees, which makes the trail more of an ankle-bender in that section.  Hopefully he'll work them into a tight formation to keep the trail surface firm and continuous.  I keep up my fluid intake, along with ample electrolytes, and after the summit I'm surprised by a long stretch of flats.  I'm grateful to let my legs unwind a bit and develop a good hiker rhythm.  Very relaxing.  I begin to fantasize that this sort of trail will continue straight to the next hut - Zealand Falls Hut - where I have a reservation for tonight.  The trail soon opens onto a boulder field at the northeastern portion of the ridge before it drops back into the tree line.  As I get out onto the ridge the rain begins to get heavy and thunder booms.  The thunder dies out but the rain picks up, becoming a soaking monsoon in no time.  But the great thing about getting wet is that once wet you can't get any wetter, and I get completely wet.  I begin to meet up with SOBO day hikers and peak baggers and realize it must be around midday.  There is one fellow I stop and chat with.  He has a dog with him - one of the many I'd seen up in these difficult trails - and we share dog stories for a minute as the rain sheets down on us.  When I'm not hiking I'm stopping to pee, which is a comical struggle to pull sodden clothes on/off of a slippery wet body.  Imagine you are standing under your home shower which is on at full blast.  Now down with the pants.  Now up with the pants; all the while wearing a backpack.  Should have captured a video of that.  The hardest part is the ""up with the pants"" portion, since the pack is in the way, my shirt is sticking to my skin and needs to be kept outside the pants, and there are just too many belts to keep straight.  Frankly, with the amount of water pouring out of the sky I could probably have just peed my pants and all the evidence would soon be washed away.  Oh well.  I own one of those lady spouts that let women pee standing up, but it's a bear to figure out how to use it with hiking pants.  Better for skirts, I think.The rain is not only cleansing but refreshing and it turns out I'll need all of that.  While I'm making much better time today - 2.0 mph or more - I soon encounter the slower downhill portion which on this section of the AT, also known as the Twinway, is ultra steep and seemingly endless. I meet a Croo member as she hiked uphill and marvel at how she travels this trail regularly.  Girl's got good legs!Finally hear the unmistakable sound of rushing water and figure the ZF Hut must be close.  Crossing streams is fording them up to shin depth and the water is fast so I take extra care not to slip and fall.  Then there is the hut and there is some sunshine!  Incredible weather changes up here.  Folks at the hut are scrambling to lay out their wet clothes and shoes while the hot sun is out and I join them.  It's around 2 pm and I've made good time for this reasonably-spaced hut-to-hut hike.  I catch up on my journaling, chat with some of the other hikers, and investigate the shuttle options for the next day.  I'd planned to hike to 302 the following day - another 8 mile stretch that looked relatively 'easy' - then catch the shuttle over to Libery Springs Parking to get my car and take a night and a shower out in Lincoln before heading back for the next section on Sunday.  OK.  Last shuttle leaves Zealand Rd at 1:50pm.  Um.  There is no way I can hike 8 miles and then walk or hitch the 3 miles to Z Rd and get there by 1:50, unless I leave before light the next day.  OK.  Rethink.  How about taking a nero to the shuttle from the hut, take a night off, then drive to the Z Rd parking lot, hike back to the hut and down to the next campsite - and bring my self-standing tent this time.  Then either hike to Pinkham or hike to Mt. Washington and take the Cog RR downhill to eventually get my car and head home.  Sounds good.  I've made a plan.","Galehead Hut

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570314,"These huts are incredible.  Unlike Lakes of the Clouds Hut, these are smaller but have a much more interesting design, with bunks rising up 4 tiers.  Wow.  I'm so glad that I slept on the first level for both nights.  That might seem like a small gift, but I didn't look forward to negotiating a ladder in the middle of the night to go find the toilet.  I did sleep well again, though, without hearing any loud snoring.  Miracle.  Breakfast was the standard fare then I was off to meet the 9:40 shuttle.  A short, mostly downhill hike with gentle grade through some brimming ponds was my morning hike.  I didn't have a reservation for the shuttle (no cell or internet service at that hut) so I was a bit anxious about getting a seat.  I followed a group of 3 women up from Connecticut who were out for a 2 night hut-to-hut hike.  They were Neucy (not sure how to spell her name), Kate, and Kelly.  All very interesting women.  Kelly was a writer, Neucy was a fast, strong hiker, and Kate was a good conversationalist who seemed to have a sincere commitment to her job of teaching 4th/5th graders.  We all made good time and were rewarded for our efforts when the shuttle arrived 15 minutes early and scooped us all up.  An hour later I was dropped off right at my car and drove it to Lincoln under troubled skies to check the weather and confirm my next move. I took a room at the Kancamagus Lodge - the very place I'd stayed in 2015 when I fell on the way down Wolf Mtn and busted 2 ribs.  The town of Lincoln was hosting a Beer Fest and very crowded so I was lucky to get the last room at the Lodge.  I hit the laundromat, ordered a burger to go, and assembled all of my gear for the next leg of my journey.  Then checked the weather.  Uh Oh.  Sunday forecast was mixed showers and thunderstorms, but the real worry was the deep drop in temperature up on the high peaks.  The forecast was showing 20-30 degree nights (probably OK for my gear) but only 40 degree days with sharp wind.  I took a sober look at my plans and my gear and compared them with the forecast before realizing that journeying into that environment with my supplies was foolhardy.  I had no desire to be the object of a rescue mission.  Think, think, think.  Although I'm still tired from the past few days I didn't feel ready to quit hiking.  I checked the weather along the northern Whites and Mahoosucs.  No go.  How about the Long Trail in Vermont?  Well...not the northern sections; same problem.  OK.  I get it.  Just start at VT 4 and go north to avoid the AT crowd. It will only be raining on Monday and then just showers and thunderstoms and the temperature will never get too bad.  Done.  Now I have another plan.","Zealand Falls Hut

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570530,"I waved goodbye to the Whites and Lincoln NH and wound my way down to Hanover where I stopped at Lou's for breakfast.  Wow.  What a feed!  They are very  hiker-friendly and serve a lovely meal.  I finished a fraction of it, ordered a burger to go, and left with enough food to eat for at least 2 days.  Perfect!  
Got to VT 4 just about a mile from the famous and wonderful Inn At The Long Trail, parked, and stepped into the woods for a bio break. Well, washed my hands off in the stream, slipped on a rock and fell hard onto roks in the stream.  Ouch.  My left shin has a knob on it that makes my leg look like it has 2 knees.  Sheeesh.  What a klutz!  Oh well, nothing broken, so off I go, NOBO on the LT.  
It is a fabulous day; easy trail, lovely weather, the typical mud/roots/rocks of the LT but the woods are inviting and the trail is forgiving.  I stop at the first shelter, about 5 miles into the hike, and become lulled by the peace and calm and beauty.  Before I knew it I was deciding to stay, setting up my tent, and trying to keep from falling asleep too soon.  
The next morning I decided to make the 5 miles back to my car be my last hike of the week, to return home to my family, and return to the Whites when I could.  It was actually a perfect way to polish off what will be my last long hike until Sept, probably.","VT 4

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579194,"It's time to return to the trail and finish New York.  I called Dave the shuttle guy who helped me get to the NY/NJ border in the early summer and arranged a shuttle from Hoyt Rd. on the NY/CT border to RPH shelter where I'd ended my earlier hike with MrsJoy.  Still, the drive to Hoyt road was nearly 3 hours so I was up at 5 and out the door by 6.  It was a nice morning drive on a clear day and a good shuttle ride to RPH.  I was hiking by 10:15.   This trail is so pretty.  Relatively easy on the body, it swung through the woods with occasional views.  It's odd, but I can't say I was super eager to get back to the trail.  Maybe it's the lure of the grandson, maybe it's just inherent laziness, but I was feeling rather ""take it or leave it"" about hiking.  But within a half hour I was completely absorbed and planning what hike to do either later this month or next spring/summer.  Go figure.  I thought it might be possible to knock off the rest of the Presidential Mtns this fall then pick off some of Maine starting in June 2018.  Those dreams kept me occupied for the rest of the morning, then I realized it was Sunday and if I could find a good radio app I might get the Patriots game on my phone.  Good idea.  Except I couldn't find a decent app.  I tried about 4 of them without luck.  Oh well.  I watched the score change until I saw the bad news.  In between sports obsessions I stopped to chat with some hikers.  Met Dolittle going solo SOBO from Kahtadin, then PawPaw in the midst of a flip flop where he was perfecting the slack pack technique.  Very interesting.  He was a granddad from Tennessee and we had a nice long talk.  He told me I'd meet up with 84 year old GreyBeard the next day.  Imagine being 84 and thru hiking the AT!  Later met a few guys having an annual 100 mile section and asking me about the trail in MA.  I rolled into Stewart Morgan shelter around 5:00 pm.  It had a hand pump a short distance that pulled good cold water up and into my platypus.  There were several nice, flat tent sites as well as the burly dove-tailed log shelter.  I chose a nice tent site and set up camp. When supper was underway I bet there would be nobody pulling in to the shelter that night so packed up the tent and moved into the shelter.  Let's hope there are no mice.  The plan for tomorrow is to get to Telephone Pioneers Shelter, but it's only about 8 miles and I was wondering what to do if I got into the shelter early.  Well, cross that bridge when I get there.  The moon is full, the owls are active, and nobody is knocking on the door. It's so lovely!","RPH Shelter

Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579202,"Well, no snoring (no one showed up), no bugs, no rodents.  Wow.  Plenty of moonlight, though, so I had a restless night.  Even so I was up early snickering at my shenanigans last night.  The sun was gone when I finally set out for my last trip to the privy.  No problem getting there, but even with my headlamp I misplaced the shelter on the return trip.  Now where did I put that shelter?  Is it here?  Over there?  Is this the way?  It was amazing to me that I couldn't find it.  I started to imagine the Hiker Headlines: ""Hiker spends cold night in woods, 20 feet from her toasty down bag and soft pad.""  Eventually I made it back to the privy, and much more carefully headed out on what I thought was the path to the shelter, this time reconnecting with my bed and giggling my way into my nice warm bag.  Oboy. Next time I should leave my headlamp at the shelter, lit up, so I can make it back without the drama.  Live and learn.  I hate oatmeal first thing in the morning.  It makes me gag.  But I washed some down with a nice sweet tea laced with electrolytes, packed up and headed out.  The trail was somewhat downhill but had its share of the ubiquitous rocks and roots.  I made good time and got to the Telephone Pioneers shelter at noon.  It was pretty unremarkable, set into a hillside, with no tentsites and little water; just too early to spend hours in this shelter.  I ate lunch - mashed potatoes and veggie cup-a-soup - and camelled up before heading out again.Just about a quarter mile from the shelter I met several section hikers going SOBO and one SOBO thru from Katahdin.  That guy was certainly a character.  He appeared to be sweating heavily and wearing a flanner shirt tied around his waist and a tee under that.  And. No. Pants.  Hmmm...just to confirm, I turned back to check him out and noted that while he had no pants on, at least he was wearing a set of black briefs.  Whew!  One hike naked experience was fun, two and I would begin to think there was something funny in trail water.  A nice overlook gave a fine view of the valley below and the ridge beyond.  I did some calculations and figured I'd be heading across that valley and up onto the ridge as I hiked north.  It was full sun and heating up.  Water was scarce so by the time I landed in a section of trail along a large swamp I gave filtering swamp water some very serious thought.  Instead, I ended up trusting to fate and hiked the long elevated boardwalk that traversed the swamp.  Sure enough, at the Appalachian Trail Rail stop on the other side of the swamp, a trail angel had left a gallon container of good clean water.  Yippeee!  No need to scrape off the layer of weeds on top!  I filled up, sat down for a quick rest, before packing up and heading out.  But wait!  The trail headed along a highway past a nursery.  Hikers welcome! Oh joy!.  I pulled, chugged a cool iced tea, and headed out again.  But wait again!  There's a food truck!  And it's OPEN!  My wildest dreams didn't include this oasis, but I hiked over, sat down, and ordered up the saltiest food I could imagine.  The proprietors made lovely conversation while my burger and fries were cooking.  They had encountered the pants-less hiker as well and commented on how clean and fully dressed I was.  OK.  I packed up my grub and headed out.  It was maybe 4 p.m. by then and I figured I'd walk until 6 at the latest.  The NY/CT line was 7 miles ahead, which surprised me.  Maybe I'll make it to CT?  From the food truck the trail wound up some fields, across several styles, past a wooden water tower and a herd of Herefords.  It finally disappeared into the woods - but not before I could look back and see the cliff look-out's I'd been visiting a few hours earlier.  I love that feeling of progress.  The woods turned wet and full of vines and briars and was not very stealth-friendly if I decided to stop and camp for the night.  Having that burger in my pack freed up a good half hour that I wouldn't have to spend finding water and setting up a meal, so I figured I might be able to get to the next shelter - Wiley Shelter - by the time I wanted to quit.  That would give me a big day, but it seemed do-able. In fact, I got to Wiley at 6:00 pm.  There were two young men from Tennessee (what's with all the TN hikers?) who seemed like they would be good company, and a young man from MA who wore dress pants and seemed withdrawn and sort of odd.  No tent sites on the ground but two platforms and after resting my tired feet for a few minutes I decided to just plow onward and grit it out for another few miles.  Then I'd get to my car.  Then I'd be on my way home to a hot bath.  OK!And so I was.  I took the last few miles slowly and got to my car just as dusk was gathering.  Two days on the trail?  One night?  One of the shortest sections in hiking history.  But I finally finished NY!  Now I've completed about 65 miles in PA, all of the trail from the NY/NJ line to Zealand Falls Hut in NH, and around 85 miles in Maine.  Gettin' there!","Morgan Stewart Shelter
