Quick Start,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561157,"Well, it's official. I've turned in my resignation at work and I have 2 weeks to finish up any outstanding jobs and get my stuff together for my trip to Georgia! The decision was a tough one and I have a lot to do and a very short time to do it all. The window to get on the trail and still have time to make it to Katahdin before October 15 is closing fast. 
I have to thank my amazing girlfriend Lisa who has given me the support to do this. She's been tolerating my hiking stories for years now and probably hopes this will shut me up once and for all (I'm thinking it won't). 
The reactions I've gotten from my friends and coworkers are awesome. I'm pretty sure it came as a surprise to everyone when I announced my resignation, but the time was right. Everyone has been so supportive and encouraging and it means a lot. At first I was telling people I might have a journal so they can follow along and at some point it just evolved into I AM going to have a journal, I'll send you a link when I get a trail name. They have so many questions about my decision and about living on the trail for 5 months. I will do a separate entry and answer the questions that I'm asked most often.",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Thu",0

But there are the moments....I'm looking forward to meeting the other hikers and stopping in the trail towns. I want to see some sunrises and hike under a full moon at least once.

Sitting here on the train ride down to GA, the anxiety is slipping away as the miles pass and I come to terms with my new reality.  Unemployed and homeless.   Temporarily anyway.  My new job is walking all day and my new home is wherever I stop walking each day.  So simple.

It got real when I saw the mountains from the train window this morning as the sun rose. Looking at the ridges, wondering which ones I'd be walking along.  
Train pulled in at 7 am and Yogi and I walked about a mile to the IHOP for one last restaurant meal.   Took an uber for the 55 min ride to the Amicalola Falls Visitor Center to register and get my hiker number.  I'm thru hiker 2039 to start the trail this year.   
Perfect weather today for the hike up to the top of the Falls.  Met a bunch of section hikers and thru hikers. Set up tonight next to Stover Creek shelter. I prefer my hammock to the mice infested shelters but I'm sure I will stay in a few when the weather is bad enough. Should sleep well tonight after an awesome 1st day.

Slept through the entire night.  8:30-6:30.
After packup and breakfast, on the trail by 7:30.  Passed by so many nice campsites along the Three Forks area. I'll have to stay there next time. 5.2 miles in by 9:45 where I took my 1st ""pack off"" break. 10 miles in by lunch at 12:15.  Had to stay at the next shelter 3-4 miles away or else walk an additional 10 to the next( which wasn't happenin on day 2).  Sometimes they just aren't spaced out right. One of the harder things to do is to take it easy- don't want to risk injury.  The 20 mile days will be here before you know it.  Got to the shelter  nice and early and took a nap. Had dinner and snickers bar for dessert There must be 30 people here all spread out. They can make all the noise they like- I'll sleep right through it.

Gooch Mountain Shelter to Neels Gap (Blood Mountain Cabins) 15 miles
True to my name, Quick Start was 1st out of camp this morning at 7:05.  The plan was 15 miles to Neels Gap due to some rumors of norovirus in the stream water.  Totally unfounded.  There were about 10 different water crossings today, all from different sources.  Also, there was no camping between mile 10-15 due to bear concerns.  As I stopped for some noro water and to treat some hotspots on my feet, I met another hiker named Bearman who was getting a cabin. I asked if he was willing to split it and just like that I was living large!  Shower! Re supply store! Air conditioning! Electrical outlets!! This place even had a tv!

Blood Mountain Cabins to Low Gap Shelter

Quick note* pictures will be coming soon, it's been hard posting entries too- just not good service in the gaps.  Also, I've heard that the signing the guestbook hasn't been working so well- I'll reach out to the site maintainer to see what's up. But thanks for all the personal messages, I'm glad you're coming along on my adventure!
Slept 10 hours in the deluxe cabin and it's amazing how much my body heals every night!! I go to bed feeling so beat up and wake up feeling like a new person everyday.  It takes about an hour or so for the muscles to loosen up though. 
Got resupplies for 4 more days at Mountain Crossing- the trail runs right through the building! 
I thought the original hiker bubble would have been long gone by the time we got to the trailhead, but everyone was sticking around to hitch a ride 6 miles into town for a BBQ.  I figured I'd wasted enough time (and money) here and it was time to get back to hiking. 
Of course it's  straight up out of town with a full heavy pack, up and over the 1st of 4 mountains today. A lot of incredible views today too(coming soon).  Bright and sunny, nothing but mountains as far as you can see.  
Legs and lungs are getting stronger,  but still have to be careful not to overdo it. Nice and exhausted after a hard day and writing from my hammock as the sun is setting. I can hear a barred owl directly over my hammock- so cool.","Blood Mountain Cabins

Woke up feeling completely healed.  Didn't even take any ibuprofen for the 1st time.  Time to feel the pain.  Knees are holding up well and the feet feel fresh for the 1st 8-10 miles anyway.  There was the threat of rain today so the original plan of 8 miles got thrown out the window so we can get closer to town for showers and resupply.  A couple of us had decided on Tray Mountain 15 miles away. I had the original 8 done by 10:30 and had a big lunch and a nap.  Had a couple 1000' descents along with the obligatory 1000' ascents right after.  The views really came in the second half of the day. Thank god the rain also decided to hold off.  I got to stop and have a water and snack break at 3 of the viewpoints- incredible.  Pictures will be coming - I promise. The rain finally came through after I was all fed and relaxing in the hammock.  Sounds like it's let up for a bit but makes no difference to me, I'll be asleep in minutes.","Low Gap Shelter

Tray Mountain Shelter to Top Of Georgia Hostel 
11 miles
 The rain was steady all night into about 7:30 in the morning. Perfect reason to sleep in.  I also needed to get into Hiawassi to resupply for another 4 days.  
The trail was misty all morning like walking in a cloud which kept it cool .  The last few days have been pretty hot and I could use the time to let my sunburn heal a little.  
Had 8.5 miles in by about noon so I had lunch at the Powell Mountain vista (pic included).  There was a storm forming off to my left and it looked like it was headed my way so I didn't wait around long after I was done eating.  I had about 3 miles left to go to get into Dicks Creek Gap and the hostel.  
The rain started coming down just as I stepped onto the front porch and 20 minutes later, I'm showered, in clean clothes, and taking the free shuttle to town to eat cooked food!!!! We all walked to the grocery store with full bellies to load up our food bags for the trail again.  Gotta watch how much junk we buy cause we're carrying every last ounce. 
We got back to the hostel around 7 and hung out getting to know one another.  We had Sherlock and Baguette(mother/daughter), Brian (FL), Ryan (TX), and PT (FL).  It was awesome- electricity, wifi, running water, and a nice bed all for $25.
The crew at TOG were incredible too. Thanks!","Tray Mountain Shelter

Slept great last night in the bunk and got up to all you can eat cereal.  It may not sound like much but we didn't have to carry it here.  Got the free shuttle to the trailhead and we were off.  Crossed the GA/NC border around noon!  1 state down, 13 to go!! 
Had lunch right over the border and then got welcomed to NC with 3 huge climbs straight up. I was totally beat after that.  
We all came to a nice overlook to watch the sunset for the 1st time this trip.  Pictures will be posted in the photos section as soon as I get good service.  The plan for now is to stop in Franklin in about 30 miles to resupply. We'll see if I can stretch my food till the NOC 56 miles away.","Dicks Creek Gap - Top of Georgia Hostel

Muskrat Creek Shelter to stealth site at mile 99
17.2 miles
The knees were a little stiff this morning so the plan was to take it easy and stop at the next shelter 5 miles away.  I got there by 9:30 and couldn't sit there all day so I pushed on to the next camping area, 4.5 miles away.  On the way there, I climbed Standing Indian Mountain.  It was a nice 1000' climb over 2 and a half miles which wasn't steep at all.  The views were incredible(check out the pics).  You could see the damage from a fire over the past winter that took out huge sections of not only this mountain, but the others around it as well.  Most of the walk today was through charred forest.  
I reached Beech Gap camping area around 1:00 and couldn't decide whether to stay or not so I took a nap.  I woke up about 30 minutes later and decided to push on to Carter Gap Shelter 3.2 miles away.  Got to the shelter at 5 and had dinner but I was feeling so good from the nap that I decided to push on, again, to the next camping area 3.7 miles away.  Got there about 7 but there were no good hammock sites so I just kept on walking. I don't know what happened to the hikers I was with for the past couple days- I took so many breaks.  Anyway, the sun was going down and I had to find a spot to set up.  Found a little clearing at mile 99 just before a huge climb and set up my hammock without the rain cover.  The night was perfectly clear with a million stars.  I was whooped and slept like a baby.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Mile 99 to Rock Gap (Gooder Grove Hostel)
6.9 miles
Slept awesome in my stealth site under the stars last night but still woke up with sore knees. Planned on going to Winding Stair Gap about 10 miles away and hitching a ride into Franklin for resupply and maybe a 0 day to rest the knees.  Went up and over Albert Mountain 1st thing- best views so far on the trip! There's a fire tower on the top but it's locked so I didn't see the sense in climbing the stairs.  
I got to Rock Gap (6 miles) at around 10:30 and met a guy named Zen who runs the Gooder Grove Hostel.   He was there picking up victims like me who were beat up by the trail and just want to get a shower and town food.  I was easy pickins.  For $23 I got a bunk at the hostel and a shuttle to the Walmart to resupply.  For an extra $5, I got my laundry done too.  He drove me through the town of Franklin to show me all the good spots but I just planned on staying off the feet for the day.  There was also a trail maintenance crew staying at the hostel and we had a big family style dinner of ham, mashed potatoes, and veggies!!  All cooked by Baloo - a huge 6'5""  German guy with a kilt who was staying at the hostel for a few days to help out Zen.  I was so rested after 1 day, I decided that I would get back on the trail tomorrow.","Stealth site near mile 99

Zen dropped me off at Rock Gap by 8AM and I was heading north again. Nice cool temps with bright morning sun, I was cruising along when I met back up with Sherlock and Baguette!  I was glad to see them. It's tough getting separated from your trail buddies but everyone's gotta hike their own hike. I met up with them just as we were approaching Siler Bald.  A .2 mile side trail brought you up to the top where there were some good views ( I prefer when they're right on the trail though). A couple miles later we were up on Wayah Bald and the observation tower. There must have been fire here also recently- the roof of the old stone tower was burnt off and all the trees around were charred.  It looked like an evil castle.  The inside was all vandalized with graffiti and empty beer cans. The view from up top was incredible though. Best views of the day no doubt.  Another 2.5 miles and I'm here at the campsite.  All set up and fed. I'm sure I'll sleep just fine tonight as well.","Rock Gap

Wayah Shelter to Rufus Morgan Shelter

Woke up kind of late today since I only have about 80 miles to do before I get picked up in Newfound Gap in 10 days.  
Played leapfrog with Sherlock and Baguette today but I'm stopping before them since I don't have to resupply at NOC.  
The highlight for today was Wesser Bald where there's an observation tower with incredible views.  The lowlight was the 6 mile, 2400' descent into the shelter but I wanted to get the pain out of the way today- no reason to put it off.  
I've been incredibly lucky with the weather so far- all sunny days with no rain forecasted till Sunday.  
The 6 mile downhill was grueling and I was so happy to see the shelter and put an end to the pain.  Made a nice hot dinner of Ramen with some cheese and Cool Ranch Doritos thrown in for extra flavor.  I'm camped here tonight with Meadowlark and Natalie.","Wayah Shelter

11.3 miles
Today was payment day! Started with a 7 mile 3500' climb out of the NOC.  It was straight up much of the way.  Had some nice views at Cheoah Bald.  Stopped at Sassafras Gap Shelter for lunch and a nap.  That climb this morning took everything out of me so I was just taking my time to the next campsite 3.6 miles away.  Got into camp around 3 and decided to call it a day and rest the knees.  As I was getting water, Brian showed up then Meadowlark.  Soon after that the German brothers were here and the campsite was full.  We had a good night talking about all the characters we've met.  We met a guy named ""90"" whos carrying a 90lb pack with books and all.  He has a trail cat that he puts on his pack when he hikes just to make it a little heavier.  There's Dirty Jesus who hikes like 30 miles a day and there's an Alaskan couple who had one of their bags stolen so they take turns carrying 1 backpack and a couple of duffel bags. They also have a huge frying pan and a box of pancake mix. There are some odd ones out here, but they're all having a good time.

Locust Grove Gap to Cable Gap Shelter 
11.6 miles (at mile 158.9)
Had a few quick showers overnight but nothing to worry about.  The real pain was the whippoorwill that chirped ALL NIGHT LONG!!  This damn bird chirped and chirped and nothing was answering it. 
The climb out of the gap was easy but our big climb for the day was just up ahead.  We had to climb up Jacobs Ladder- it's a 900' rise in about .6 miles- straight up.  It was a workout especially with the humidity today but it could've been worse.  I wouldn't want to do that in the rain.  After that we had about 4 or so miles of the easiest trail so far.  It basically wrapped around a few mountains about half way up with very little up and down.  There was an occasional peak to go over but nothing too hard.  Knees are still sore so I'm calling it a day at 11.5 miles.  There's a huge downhill coming up and I'll just hit it tomorrow and then check into the Fontana Village where Lisa made a reservation for me- Woohooo!
Showers, laundry, and restaurant food!!
So tonight I made a little campfire to get rid of some of these bugs. They call this hiker T.V.  Sat around the fire with Natalie(Tippy Toes), Bill and Billy(father/son) and had great conversation.  Just as I'm laying here, the wind is picking strong, cooling everything off and blowing away some of the humidity- good sleeping weather.","Locust Grove Gap Tentsite

Cable Gap Shelter to Fontana Lodge
5 miles 
The 1st rain test.  My incredible streak of sunny warm weather came to an end today as I woke up to a steady light rain. I only had 5 miles to walk today and couldn't check into my room till after 4 so I tried to patiently wait out the rain. I fidgeted in my hammock till 8:30 and couldn't take it any longer. Let's just get it over with.  Packed up all my gear and managed to stay mostly dry.  I was really trying to psych myself up for this, after all, it's just a little water. I was reading Postcards book last night about hiking in rain and it's mostly attitude. It's not the end of the world, just a little nuisance.  Besides, I had a warm dry room to go to tonight. It was actually fun waking in it and the temps were mild enough that I didn't need my raincoat on. Hiking in the raincoat just makes me sweat anyway, the cool rain feels much cleaner.  
After about 2 hours, I arrived at the Fontana Marina where there is a phone to call for a shuttle to the village.  Arrived at the village by noon but had to wait for the room to be ready so I went to the grill to have a nice warm meal.  I ran into Tippy Toes then Meadowlark and Mo (Momentum).  We hung out on the patio as the sun came out and 4 hours flew by.  More and more hikers strolled in and before you know it, we outnumbered the other guests.  
This is an awesome little village with a general store (crazy expensive), laundry, and a few restaurants.  The staff were also incredibly nice to the hikers. 
I got checked into my room, cleaned and dried all my gear, took a shower, did my laundry, and had the rest of the night to hang out with the rest of my hiker buddies.  Hot Sauce and James showed up with a few more that I hadn't met yet and we had a great time talking about all the weirdos out here with us.  Around 9:00 we all suddenly got sleepy and headed off to our rooms. Seems like hiker midnight hits even when we're in town.","Cable Gap Shelter

Fontana Lodge to Mollies Ridge Shelter
13.1 miles
Not so bad up into the Smokies.  After a good nights sleep in Fontana, we got the shuttle back to the marina to pick up where we left off. We walked across the Fontana Dam and into Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  Everybody has been kind of apprehensive about the Smokies because of the high elevation, the camping restrictions, and the lack of exit points. It's only about 70 miles from beginning to end, but there is only 1 access point in the middle at Newfound Gap.  There are Ridge runners that check permits and enforce the camping regulations. Everyone must stay in a shelter and you can only tent if the shelter is full.  I sleep in a hammock so I had to have my sleeping pad shipped to me just in case there was shelter space.  
We climbed about 2000' over 4 miles to enter the Smokies and went right up to Shuckstack Mountain where there's a fire tower.  Got some great views just as the clouds rolled in.  Got to the shelter by 4 and set up my sleeping pad. I was looking forward to using it since I was carrying the extra weight and it was supposed to rain overnight. I hate packing up wet gear.  There are a lot of people here tonight- 14 makes the shelter full and 4 tents set up nearby. I met Atlas- he carried a 110 lb pack up Blood Mountain. He's since trimmed it down to 60lbs. He immediately hung the American flag at the shelter and started a fire.  He then cooked up enough food for everyone at the shelter.  (look at the photos with all his food)","Fontana Lodge

Mollies Ridge Shelter to Siler's Bald Shelter 
18.5 miles
I despise sleeping in these mouse infested shelters but it's the rule in GSMNP to reduce the impact of all the hikers/campers.  It was very uncomfortable sleeping on the wooden platform with all the snorers and the tossing and turning.  But enough about the good part of the day.  
The rain started in the middle of the night and I headed out into it around 7:30 AM planning on making it to Siler's Bald Shelter.  There were 0 views today and it was the 1st time on this trip that I didn't take a single photo- didn't want to get the phone wet.  The thing about hiking in the rain is that as soon as you stop, you begin to get very cold, very fast. 
Stopped for lunch at the Derrick Knob Shelter where I ran into Laz-e Boy (formerly Brian from FL). He had put on his dry stuff just so he could relax and have a warm lunch.  I probably should have done the same but I just wanted to get the hike over with today.    I scarfed down my pepperoni and cheese wrap and had a little snickers bar treat and I was on my way.  
I made it to Siler's Bald Shelter around 4 and got into my emergency dry clothes and warmed up under my quilt. There was a Ridge Runner here checking permits and enforcing the regulations so no campfire tonight.  Made my dinner of Ramen with some crushed Doritos and climbed back under the covers. 
It's not going to be rainbows and butterflies everyday.  There's a saying out here: no rain, no pain, no Maine and today I was batting 2 for 3.  But the silver lining is that the adversity made me realize  how determined I am to keep moving forward.  I've hiked through some blisters and knee pain and now the added rain is just another layer that I will overcome. I'm actually kind of glad it happened 1 thing at a time.  It could have been overwhelming but this way is manageable.  I have no idea how the earlier hikers do this with snow!!","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Siler's Bald Shelter to Newfound Gap
12.8 miles 
Sometimes the mountain wins.  Torrential downpours and cold windy conditions whooped me today and forced us into Gatlinburg TN. We woke up to near freezing temps and zero visibility and put on the clothes that were still soaked from yesterday's storms. The only thing to do is start walking immediately or start shivering. I started walking. Fast.  The original plan was to do about 15 miles to Icewater Spring Shelter. The fog was coming and going and the wind was knocking all the leftover rain off of the trees and onto my head.  The trail was beautiful through dense fir trees above 5500'.  We also passed through high meadows but unfortunately there have been no views for us up to this point in the Smokies.
A couple big landmarks today were climbing Clingmans Dome- the highest point on the entire AT and passing the 200 mile mark.  We climbed the tower at Clingmans Dome just for principal and as I tried to take some photos of the fog, the wind blew off my hood and my hands quickly froze.  I went down twice as fast as I climbed up and checked that off the to-do list. Just as we passed the 200 mile mark, the skies opened up with a freezing cold rain that had me soaked through in less than 5 mins.  There was lightning flashing and thunder in the distance and I thought for a second ""I should really get inside"" and quickly realized there was no inside.  Brief panic followed by acceptance kept me moving along.  I better get used to the thunder and lightning. I'm certain it will happen plenty in the near future. I checked my map and found that I had 5.5 miles to Newfound Gap parking area where there are restrooms and potential hitches into Gatlinburg.  I put my head down and made the miles, sloshing right through the trail which was now an ankle high stream.  As I came out to the parking area, the rain had slowed and there were a few tourists just lingering out of their cars. I stood there shivering trying to check my phone for service and looking pathetic hoping someone would offer a ride.  After about 45 seconds, I asked the 1st group of  guys I saw if they could give me a lift.  Blake, Mike, and Zeke didn't blink an eye and said no problem and even apologized for their smell because they had gone out on a morning hike.  Hahahaha- I win any stink contest, hands down, against mere Day hikers. We had a nice drive into Gatlinburg and I even got some views as the clouds were breaking. It was nice getting to meet them and good luck Zeke, the future soccer star who's starting high school in the fall.  
Within 5 minutes of landing in Gatlinburg, I get a call from Lazy Boy- I've been hiking with him off and on since about day 7.  He got his name because he carries a foldable chair that he whips out on every break while the rest of us sit on the ground. He's literally in the store that I'm sitting in front of. Me, him, and another hiker (Mike) split a room at the Travel Lodge.  Within 45 minutes we're all showered up and on the main strip in Gatlinburg eating at the Smokey Mountain Brewery. Hard to believe that an hour before, I was soaked and near hypothermic and now here I am in tourist heaven.  Dirty Jesus, the German brothers, and Benji are in town for the night also so we hit the town again for 2nd dinner. We had a hell of a time at the brewery with the musicians and the locals are just incredibly awesome to the hikers.

1st 6 zero days
Got a good nights sleep in the Travel Lodge Inn and free breakfast was awesome too.  Laz E Boy and Mike decided to take a zero with me on Thursday which was awesome.  I was stuck here till Friday anyway and it was great to have some buddies around.  I think I saw every hiker I'd ever met swing through Gatlinburg in the 3 days I was there. It was a huge party.  
The guys got back on the trail Friday and I started making my way towards Pigeon Forge to meet up with Lisa on Saturday.  
Stayed at a hotel in Pigeon Forge Friday night and Lisa came Saturday!!
We had 4 awesome days together relaxing in the cabin(Thanks Sherry and Art!!!) and doing the touristy thing in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The time flew by and I was well rested and all healed up for the trail. The time off also helped heal the knees.","Newfound Gap - Gatlinburg

Back on the trail.  After 6 days of no hiking, it was time to get back at it.  Just an FYI- I'm only counting the days that I hike which is why I'm on Day 18.
It was extremely difficult watching Lisa drive away as she headed for the airport. I will not lie, I had serious thoughts of jumping in the car with her.  But my place is here right now, on the trail.  
For all the views I missed last week with the terrible weather, today more than made up for it.  Sunny skies and cool temps made the perfect hiking day.  I stopped so many times today and took so many pictures.   
Highlight for today was Charlie's Bunion.  A rock outcropping with an incredible view. There I met Traps and Trapper Keeper.  A nice couple from N. Virginia that distracted me from missing Lisa.  I could see Mt. LeConte to the west along with Gatlinburg and some lakes in the distance.  Mt. LeConte became the focal point of the day as I was able to see it as I got farther and farther away.  Every time I had a view, there it was- getting smaller and smaller. 
Had lunch around mile 9 at Bradleys View.  Looking eastward toward NC, mountains as far as you could see with no roads or housed mixed in.  It's amazing how much untouched land there is out there.
Made it to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter around 4 and set up my sleeping pad in the shelter.  I was hoping for it to fill up so I could hammock outside, but no luck.  Maybe I'll push on for 20 tomorrow to get out of the Smokies but we'll see how the knees feel in the morning.  
Staying at the shelter tonight are Chief (76 yr old marathon runner-super fast hiker) and Cowboy (thru-hiker).  Also a couple groups of section hikers including the 3 engineers from GA. Later in the night some southbounders came in- not sure if they had started in Maine but they had that long term hiker look. Basically dirty and smelly.
Let's give this shelter thing one more chance.","Newfound Gap - Gatlinburg

I had only planned to go on to the Davenport Gap Shelter but the thought of 1 more night in those shelters gave me the motivation I needed to push on.  Besides, Cowboy said he was pushing on and I don't like to be left behind. 
Leap-frogged with Chief and Cowboy all day until lunch when Cowboy passed by.  I didn't see him again till that night. 
Beautiful weather and scenery all day today.  The 2nd half of the Smokies were much better than the 1st.  
Passed by the side trail for Davenport Shelter and kept going.  As soon as I left the Smokies I felt like a free man again.  I'll camp wherever I want and sleep in my hammock too.  But not tonight - I'm heading to Standing Bear Farm Hostel.  I have to resupply to get me to Hot Springs (and a shower and bed are always nice too).   Crossed the Pigeon River and passed under I40 and made it to the hostel by 4:30.  There was Clark- an old grey bearded dude that sat out front in a rocking chair and was the caretaker of the bunkhouse.  He gave me the tour- laundry building, kitchen building, shower building, and resupply building.  There was a good selection for resupply and plenty of junk food too.  
Turns out I'm the only guest tonight so I should sleep pretty good with all the peace and quiet.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Slept so good at the hostel last night.  The bunkhouse was empty other than me and Clark.  They leave the doors open and the fresh air was nice.  I was packed up and on the trail by 8:30- a little later than normal but who cares. 
Of course it was straight up out of the hostel.  About 2500' in 4 miles but I felt great and only had to stop a couple times to catch my breath.  It feels like I'm getting in better shape.  My mind wanders while I'm walking uphill and before you know it, the climb is over. I was expecting Cowboy to pass me at some point but I didn't see him.  The uphills did eventually get the better of me.  I was getting pretty worn out when I got to Max Patch. The views here are unlike anything I have ever seen!  At the top of the patch, there is a 360 degree view and the weather was perfect!! The pictures just can't capture it.  I could see forever in every direction.  While I was up there I met Acorn and Cheese.  Wife and husband who thru-hiked in 2014.  They had started late in May and made it with plenty of time even after getting off trail for vacations.  They were actually camping up on the patch tonight.  
I got to the shelter a little later than normal and met Whistler who was there with his son Justin, daughter in law Marsha and their 2 boys Cade and Cooper.  They had a nice fire started within minutes.  They came out for the night and we're prepared to feed an army.  I couldn't say no when they offered me a hot dog so I had 3, with cheese.  They had offered me more but I didn't want to be a pig.  What an awesome family.  
Cowboy eventually arrived to help finish off the hot dogs and we both were a little surprised at how tough the day was. It caught us both by surprise.  We're trying to get to Hot Springs tomorrow, about 18 miles away.  
Just as I was getting ready to call it a night, Kuhn (pronounced Coon) from Belgium arrived.  He was hiking in Shenandoah when he met another hiker and got off the trail to hang out with him and his family for 3 weeks.  He's just in the country for 6 months and doesn't care about finishing the trail. Gotta love that attitude.  He had a great time and is now back at it heading south. 
It's nice to finally be back in my hammock after about 2 weeks of hostels, shelters, and hotels.  Let's see if I remember how to do this.","Standing Bear Farm Hostel

The push was on to get to Hot Springs and get some town food and resupply.  I walked into town with an empty food bag, which is a first.  The trail goes right down the Main Street of the town so the 1st thing to do is pick a hostel and get cleaned up.  I heard good things about Elmers Sunnydale so I headed there.  Turns out the whole place was booked up for some biologists party.  So I backtracked to the Laughing Heart Hostel.  $5 cheaper and they had Wifi!  For $20 I got a bed and a shower.  There was also a fully stocked kitchen, I was told to help myself to anything in there.  Thanks, but I'm not cooking anything while I'm this close to town. Some of these hostels have a vortex that traps hikers there for days at a time.  There were a few here that had been here for a week or so.  I ran into Magnito (now Jeffe) that I met on day 2 of the hike.  He was super fast, at least until this place. The place had a very friendly vibe and I can see why some people decide to stay longer.  
I stopped in the Hillbilly Market for an ice cream and to check out the resupply options then off to the Smokey Mountain Diner for some town food!  Headed back to the hostel to do some chores and back to the diner with Cowboy for dinner #2.  Pizza wasn't half bad.  By then it was around 9:00, hiker midnight. There was a fire out back but I was whooped after an 18 mile day.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Headed out of town and crossed the French Broad River and back up into the mountains.  Beautiful views and nice weather until about 2:30 when a thunder storm swept through.  I set up my rainfly and was able to avoid most of the rain but it didn't matter much because I was already soaked in sweat.  As soon as the rain let up, I continued on to the next shelter about 7 miles away.  Got to the shelter area and set up my hammock and got in my clean dry clothes.  Washed my dirty stuff in the stream and put it in a big ziplock to keep in my sleeping bag- warm and wet is better than cold and wet in the morning.  Long day and 19+ miles is pretty good for coming out of town with a full and heavy food bag.

Tough to get up this morning after the big miles yesterday so I didn't get out of my hammock until 7:30.  On the trail by 8:15 and started with a climb of 1100' in 1 mile.  Pretty steep.  I thought the rest of the day was supposed to be easier but the elevation profile didn't show all the rocks I'd be climbing today.  It started raining around 9:30 which made the rocks a little tricky.  Just as I got to the top, the clouds parted and I got some amazing views of the clouds below me (see pics). The rain stopped around 11:30 and I passed some guys at Jerry Cabin Shelter.  I wasn't ready for lunch so I pushed on to the next shelter  7 miles up.  Just as I arrived it started to rain again. I figured I would just eat lunch and take a nap as see if the rain stops.   By  4:30 the rain hadn't stopped and it was 9+ miles to the next shelter so I decided to call it a day. 14 miles is a little less than I would've liked but at least I'm dry. I also thought I was gonna catch up to some of my old buddies. At each shelter there is a register that we sign as we pass by and I got a message from the German Brothers telling me not to take anymore 0's. They were here yesterday.  Bearman was here this morning and was staying at the next shelter but I just wasn't willing to go for it in the rain.  The next few days should be nice so I'll catch up with them soon enough.  I'm here tonight with Jersey (north Jersey guy), Dave, Jay and a group of 5 Boy Scouts.  Tom and Jerry from the hostel also came in late so it's a packed house.","Little Laurel Shelter

The shelter was a tough choice but it rained all night so I didn't have to set up or take down in the rain.  That got me on the trail by 7:30.  Nice easy trail for the 1st few miles then one of the 2 big climbs of the day- 3 miles up 1600'.  I prefer the climbs in the morning when the legs are fresh.  Sunny skies today and cool temps kept the sweat factor down, perfect hiking weather.  
Passed by Gitfiddle at the highway overpass- he was flying yesterday but the wet boots wrecked his feet and he was trying to tape them up.  He was walking with a pretty bad limp so he's not going to be at the shelter till late.  
Didn't pass many other hikers today so it was kind of quiet.  Walked up and over Big Bald Mountain- it was just as incredible as Max Patch a couple days ago.  Plenty of pics as well.  The town off in the distance is Mars Hill.  
Made it to the shelter around 6 pretty worn out.  Wandering Star was there.  I met her my 1st night in the Smokies.  She's an older British woman that chain smokes and she's on her 3rd thru-hike of the AT!! She's also a triple crowner so she's also hiked the PCT and the CDT. She has a quick wit and she sings old British tunes- this is one tough lady. She's heading to Damascus VA before catching a Greyhound bus to Maine and finishing southbound.  I hope to see her again as our paths cross. Also at the shelter were Tipper (ATC trail support), and 3 southbounders finishing up their hike from last year.  
I had the best setup with my hammock and forgot to take a picture.  I'll take one soon so you can see how I sleep when I stay outdoors.","Flint Mountain Shelter

Big Bald Shelter to Uncle Johnny's Hostel 
16 miles
Slept so good last night.  It was cold but I was nice and toasty under the down quilt but it was tough to get up. I had 1 mission today and that was to get to Erwin TN and Uncle Johnny's hostel.  I heard this place was awesome from other hikers and I really just wanted a shower and to do my laundry.  Of course the town food is always a bonus. 
The trail was graded pretty good for most of the miles but the final 2000' descent in 2 miles was a knee crusher.  It didn't seem to matter as I flew down the trail focused solely on getting clean again.  
I made the 16 miles in a little over 6 hours and was happy to see that the hostel was basically across the street from the trail.  
Taco and Songbird were there along with a group of hikers I hadn't met yet.  
Got cleaned up and did my laundry all in time for the 5:30 shuttle into town for dinner and resupply.  Mexican or Italian??  That's a no brainer- Italian all the way for me!! Baked Tortellini with alfredo and some meatballs followed by a couple Cannoli!! That hit the spot!! 
I bought way too much food for resupply so now my pack is an anchor again.  I only needed 3 days to get me 50 miles to Mountain Harbour Hostel- I have about 5 days of food to carry. 
I hung out on the front deck of the hostel with Jersey, Low Gear, F'it Jim, Yoda, Ishkabibble, and Fun Size. The knee is a little sore from pushing it today so maybe I'll make a late start tomorrow- they have a breakfast shuttle in the morning that goes to the Huddle House!!","Big Bald Shelter

Uncle Johnny's Hostel
Woke up a little after 7:30 and decided I could use a zero day to rest up.  I had done 120+ miles in the last 7 days so I think I earned it.  Besides, the knee was a little tweaked and I didn't need much more of a reason.  Also there was a chance of showers so it all fell into place.  
Uncle Johnny's sits right on the Nolichucky River and has a little resupply store in the front that sells coffee so I had a couple even before the 8:30 breakfast shuttle.  Gary is the caretaker and runs the store and oversees all the work being done throughout the day.  He's a real joker and picked up on the Jersey accent right away. He's from Williamstown MA so we started right off doing imitations of each other's accents.  He was totally off but he did have the cursing down pretty good. 
They have a big Rottweiler mix here that is around 14 years old.  His name is Jerry Garcia and he has the run of the place. He just walked in 3 years ago and decided to call it home.  He is the calmest, coolest dog ever.  He sits right in the middle of the road out front, people just drive around him. 
They also offer work-for-stay if you can't afford a bunk and there were about 4 people here working off their bill.  One guy, Yoda, has been here a month and has no plans on leaving anytime soon.  He just works a few hours a day and is good to go.  Low Gear has been here a few days and has worked off most of his bill too. It's an awesome set up and some people can't resist the pull of the hostel vortex.  They just do some cleaning and organizing or some yard work.  There's restocking the store shelves and even doing some electrical repairs.  They also run a lot of shuttles for hikers and paddlers. 
Jersey decided to take a zero as well so we just hung out on the deck and talked to all the new hikers walking in for the day.  Bubbles, who I'd met at Laughing Heart came in.  Git Fiddle showed up and Big Time came in.  Lisa and I gave Big Time a ride into Gatlinburg when I was on my little vacation a week ago.  It's great to catch up with everyone as they pass through.  
Time for the dinner shuttle and I guess it's Mexican tonight.  We had a big group and it was a blast!! Everything is good when you're clean and eating town food with fellow hikers!!
Came back to the hostel around 8 and hung out on the deck until we started peeling off to bed 1 after another.  It was the perfect 0 day and some rain showers even came through to prove we made the right decision.  
This is what I hoped the trip would be like and I can't help but feel incredibly lucky that I'm able to experience it.","Uncle Johnny's Hostel

It was really tough to leave the hostel this morning.  Now I know how strong the vortex is.  I slept pretty well for the most part except for Jerry Garcia ( the old dog) must've gotten up to pee like 6 times throughout the night and he let the door slam shut every time!  It's amazing to see the old guy walk up to the door, stand up on the knee wall with one paw and pull the door open with the other.  And he strolls right back in and curls up on his couch.  
A few hikers were unable to leave including Bubbles who was waiting for a package.  I just had to walk away around 8 am.  Of course it was up,up, and more up out of town.  And with a full food bag.
The weather was perfect! Sunny and 70!
There were plenty of views today too. After I got past the sadness of leaving the last hiker bubble, it was all miles and smiles.  The plan was to do 17.1 and get to Cherry Gap Shelter but the legs were feeling so good ( and the shelter was a dump), I decided to push on.  I saw Low Gear had stopped by and kept going as well as Katisa.  I caught up to then around 6:45 and wanted to keep going but decided I better not overdo it. 
I set up camp and made dinner and was in my hammock by 8:00 just waiting for the sun to go down.  Today's hike was just incredible and at 21.5 miles was my longest yet.  This trip just keeps getting better!!","Uncle Johnny's Hostel

Slept so good last night that when I got up, Katisa and Low Gear had left and I didn't even hear them.  I rolled out of my hammock around 7:30 and felt like I was late for work or something.  Got packed up quick and had breakfast of a protein bar and a mini Snickers, chugged a bottle of water and hit the trail.  The legs felt a little tired this morning, I guess from the long day yesterday.  The uphills tired me out quick but the legs eventually woke up.  There was no soreness though so that was awesome.  It's so easy to overdo it out here.  The problem is, you don't know till it's too late.  
Today had a hard time matching yesterday for some reason but it was still a beautiful day.  A little warmer but not bad.  I had a huge 5 mile climb just after noon so maybe I was just dreading that.  Went up Roan Mountain and was a little disappointed when there really wasn't much of a view but what can you do.  The forest above 5500' was incredible though.  It's all fir trees and the smell of pine is awesome.  Also, everything on the forest floor including the fallen trees are covered in green moss like a carpet. 
I was surprised when I came down the other side of Roan Mountain and saw a huge parking lot filled with day trippers.  It turns out the views are all over here!!  There were some high grass covered balds that reminded me a lot of the Franconia Ridge in NH.  You could see the paths leading up to the peaks and all the people walking on them were so tiny from so far away.  Again, the weather was perfect and I could've taken pictures all day but I kept on moving.  
I caught up with Low Gear as I was heading up to Janes Bald and we headed on to Overmountain Shelter for the night which makes a 2nd day in a row over 20 miles! Wooohooo!!
The entire area is packed with weekenders and there are tents set up all over the place- it almost looks like Folkfest!! I wish there was a band here! 
Made dinner and am hanging in my hammock waiting for hiker midnight.  The plan for tomorrow is to head to Mountain Harbour Hostel and pick up my resupply  box that Lisa mailed for me.  I planned on staying there at 1st but I already spent 2 nights indoors this week.  I guess it'll be a game time decision.","Stealth site mile 364.1

Slept awesome in the hammock last night and I was far enough away from the crowds that set up on the meadow.  The plan for the day was to do the 10 miles and get to Mountain Harbour Hostel for my resupply. As soon as I woke up, I knew I was staying indoors tonight.  It is soooo hard to pass up a shower and town food.  
The hike out of the shelter was straight up but the views were incredible!!  First was Little Hump Mountain.  It's a grassy bald, like Max Patch, where you can see the trail for over a mile.  The weather was perfect and the views reminded me of the Whites in NH.  After that, I went up Hump Mountain.  Even bigger (obviously).  The people walking up look so tiny, it's such a neat perspective.  I was jealous of the people that pitched their tents up here last night.  I bet they got an awesome show of the stars.  I had asked a couple if it was clear last night and they both got the biggest smiles explaining what they saw.  As I got to the road crossing, there was a guy in a pickup offering rides to another hostel that included shower, laundry, and town shuttles for no extra fee.  Since I was hiking with Low Gear all day, I let him decide.  The offers of PBR's at Dave's place convinced him easily.  So off we went to Doe River Hostel.  The hostel is also a working farm with chickens, horses, and goats!! Dave also had a piano and a guitar and wouldn't you know, I still can't play either very well.  Low Gear and I hit Bob's Dairyland for dinner and got my resupply all packed up.  My bag is now 32lbs!! It's gaining weight!! Meanwhile I'm down to 177. In turning into a hiking machine.","Overmountain Shelter

Today was just a big mile day.  Lots of little ups and downs but nothing that got me too out of breath.  It turns out that Roan Mt. TN is the rhododendron capital of the world and that's all I saw today was rhododendrons.  They were so thick that towards the bottom of the hills, it was almost dark during the middle of the day.  None of them were in bloom (I think I'm late for that). I'm sure it looks amazing when they all go at the same time. A couple milestones for the day were:
I'm out of NC for good.  I've been straddling the TN/NC border since the Smokies. 
And I passed the 400 mile mark.  They do seem to be coming a lot quicker lately.         The original plan was to get to Moreland Gap Shelter about 17 miles away but I've felt guilty about sleeping indoors so much so I needed to at least get a 20 in there.  So I signed the register at the shelter to let Low Gear know and I pushed on.  About 3 miles down the trail was a little campsite next to the water source.  There were 2 ladies already set up there but I needed to stop for water anyway.  They said I was welcome to join the campsite so I found the only 2 trees around and set up my hammock.  They were struggling with the fire and the bugs were terrible here so I got a pile of firewood and showed them the hand sanitizer cheat for starting the fire.  A little hand sanitizer on the little sticks and they burn long enough to catch everything else.  True Nature and ""89"" were their names and they had become a team a few weeks ago. You could tell how they worked together to get their chores done.  89 also had a couple of dogs- good to keep the bears away. They were a funny pair and we had a nice time by the fire eating our dinners.  By 9:00 I was ready to pass out.  No problems getting to sleep tonight.","Doe River Hostel

20 miles and not 1/10 more today.  I had planned on going to Vandeventer Shelter 21.7 miles but the hills whooped me today.  The forecast called for rain starting at 9:00 am so I wanted to get an early start to at least get some dry miles.  Up at 6:15 and on the trail at 7:00. Low Gear started from his shelter very early so he was walking by just as I was getting on the trail.  Glad he caught up.  The ladies had planned to go to Black Bear Resort about 4 1/2 miles up the trail and Low Gear was ready to join them due to the coming rain.  It took everything I had in me not turn onto that side trail, and besides, it wasn't even raining yet.  I pushed on over Heartbreak Hill. A 3 mile, 2000' climb followed by a 3 mile, 2000' ft descent.  It seemed so pointless.  It didn't sound that hard but it took all my energy for the day and I still had 10+ miles to do.
I came out of the woods and into Watauga Lake.  A public access Lake with a beach and picnic area.  I made my lunch under a tree and watched all the people swimming and boating. It was a nice place and I hung around for about an hour.  Sun was still shining.  So glad I didn't get off the trail. I pushed on, following the trail around the lake and to the dam before heading back up into the mountains.  The climbs were tough and the heat had taken my energy away but I needed to get to the next water source 5 miles away at the very least.  I stumbled into the spring area and immediately set up my hammock.  It was only 5:00 but I was done for the day.  I got out of my sweat soaked clothes and got cleaned up at the stream. In my nice clean clothes, laid down in the hammock for a nap.  Got up and made dinner of Beef Ramen with mayo and Doritos.  I learned the mayo thing from Wandering Star.  It's a great way to add calories and bulk up your dinner. It's also good if you have a tuna packet to add to the noodles.

The alarm went off at 6:15 but I wasn't budging. Yet. The 20 miles from yesterday were still a little painful so I decided that I deserved another hour of sleep.  It was so worth it.  I heard a hiker pass by my campsite and that was enough to get me out of the hammock.  Packed up my gear then had to put on the wet clothes from yesterday.  I wonder how long it will be before I'm ok with that.  Got to talk to some SOBO's (southbounders) as I was eating my breakfast.  They had it rough yesterday as well- must've been the heat.  
The forecast was calling for more thunderstorms this afternoon but we'll see how it goes.  It was nice walking while the temps were cool early this morning.  That should be motivation enough to get me out of bed earlier. 
I heard from Low Gear around lunch time- he went to see a doctor yesterday because he wasn't feeling right. Turns out he was just really dehydrated from the heat and humidity yesterday.  He decided to get off the trail and head home, even if just temporarily.  I know it wasn't an easy decision.  
After lunch, I came out to a road crossing and into a huge cow pasture.   The trail goes right through someone's farm.  There are stiles to climb over when crossing from one pasture to another and I walked right through one that had cows.  They didn't pay me any attention at all.  I was whistling at them like you would to a dog and they didn't even bother to look up.  It was nice and sunny with a little breeze as I walked through the exposed field.  I do prefer the shade of the forest though. Then it was back up into the mountains.  Passed by a couple shelters but I had my mind set on Abbington Shelter, 25 miles from my starting point.  I really had my energy in late afternoon and was flying at about 3 MPH pace, even uphill when the thunder started rumbling.  It was getting closer and I only had about 5 miles left. I kept pushing on.  Just as it started to rain, I came up to this little shelter and ducked in just to stay dry.  It was 6:30 so I figured I would cook my dinner in here and wait out the storm.  There was no moving after I ate- the legs and feet had tightened up for the night and I didn't feel like pushing on for just 1.2 more miles.  23 will have to do for today- it's still a personal best for me.  I have 11 miles to get into Damascus VA and my 4th state!!  I should be there by noon, maybe a bit earlier.  Can't wait to get a shower!!!
Side Note- I want to thank everyone for signing the guest book.  It is a huge pick-me-up to see who is following along and I'm glad you're joining me on my journey.  I also know that it doesn't always work for a lot of you as well. I have reached out to Leif (site moderator) and he is doing everything he can to correct the issue not just for me but for other hikers also.","Tentsite Mile 434.5

Set the alarm for 5:30 thinking I wanted to get a quick start (haha) this morning.  The alarm went off and it was still dark? Went back to sleep for another 45 minutes till the sun came up.  Got packed up quick and on the trail by 6:30.  It's so easy when you stay in a shelter.  I still had the burst of energy from yesterday and kept a 3 MPH pace all the way to the TN/VA state line. 3 states down!!! VA is a big challenge though.  Roughly 1/4 of the entire trail is in this state and a lot of people get off trail due to the ""Virginia blues"".  It makes sense that after about a month, you start to question yourself.  What am I doing out here? Is it still fun?  My answer is- I'm out here to finish this thing and hell yea it's still fun.  Everyday is an adventure.  They're not all perfect but they are an adventure.
I made it into Damascus around 10 AM.  11.3 miles.  I was motivated. The trail goes right down the Main Street in town so I picked a hostel close to everything.  I stayed at ""The Place"". Bearman had recommended it to me.  $7 donation for a bunk and a shower-can't beat that.  It's run by the local Baptist church so there are a few rules.  No smoking, no alcohol, and no cursing.  WTF? No smoking?!?
Got cleaned and took care of town chores + a haircut.  I feel like a new person.  
This town is a hiker/biker town.  The Virginia Creeper trail ends here and they'll shuttle you and a bike to the top of the hill and you can coast most of the way down.  The trail runs on an old railroad bed and follows a creek.  It looks like a lot of fun and I'd like to come back and try it. 
The Place is nice and quiet, lights out at 10:00 so everyone goes to the other hostels to party before stumbling in here to crash.  I wasn't really motivated to go looking for a party so I took care of all my stuff and was in bed by 10.

Didn't sleep very well last night with ""Train Wreck"" in the room.  Loudest snorer I ever heard! I was out the door at 7 sharp and heading over to Mojo's for a huge town breakfast and some coffee!  Juevos Rancheros and 2 cups of coffee did the trick and I was hiking with purpose at 8:00.  Didn't have a specific destination so I'll just hike till I don't feel like it anymore.  
The trail was nice and kept criss-crossing with the Virginia Creeper Trail. The only difference was that the AT was going up and down the mountains while the VCT stayed nice and level.  It was nice to know I was in VA and making progress.  I got to a shelter around 3:30 but wasn't ready to call it a day.  I met Marathon and Mr. O there.  They were setting up for the night and making dinner.  The next shelter was 12.7 miles away and I was feeling good so I pushed on.  I kept up a 3+ MPH pace for a bit but the last climb (2000', 4 miles) took its toll on me.  
I was surprised with the best view I've had in a couple of days.  Up on Buzzard Rock I could see for 360 degrees and the wether was different in every direction.  I think I got some good pics, check them out.  I stayed up on the rocks for about an hour, letting my shirt dry out and enjoying the view.  I had the place all to myself also which was nice.  I was surprised because it was Friday and the weekenders come out in force around here.  I was tempted to camp up here on the hill but the weather was too unpredictable for the night- didn't want to be up here for a thunder storm. It was about 6:00 when I started walking again and I figured there was no reason to push too hard to the next shelter so I would start looking for a place to camp.  I hit the tentsite at 7 and got a fire going and made dinner.  I'm right near a cow pasture and I can hear them mooing.  24 miles today!!

Didn't want to wake up today, I think the big mile days just require a little extra sleep to recover.  Got out of my hammock around 7:30 and was slow to pack up.  Didn't get on the trail till 8:30- a little late for me.  Straight up into the cow pasture and they were not friendly.  This one cow with a calf nearby was doing the bull move and scraping its front hoof on the ground. I had to raise my poles a couple times to defend myself. I will a hit a cow, seriously.  She stared me down the whole time I walked by and I was glad to be gone.  
Up the first climb and off to my left were a couple wild ponies walking through a campsite of about 3 tents. I dropped my pack and went to check it out.  The campers weren't amused by them anymore as they had to deal with them poking at their tents all night long.  It was still new to me so I was petting them and letting them lick my arm.  Just have to make sure they don't do the turn around move and throw a kick your way.  
I wasn't expecting the ponies yet because I hadn't made it into Grayson Highlands Park where they have hundreds of them.
I passed by the junction to the Mt. Rodgers trail (highest peak in VA) but I wasn't doing it. That's an extra 1 mile round trip and not much of a view.  There was a shelter in that area, Thomas Knob Shelter, that had a bunch of awesome campsites surrounding it.  I wish I had pushed on yesterday.  
I crossed the boundary and was in GHP when I also crossed the 500 mile mark!!
Unfortunately, it started to rain pretty heavy so I didn't linger to play with the ponies.  The trail was tough also with all the slippery roots and rocks. I thought I was going to have another big mile day based on the elevation profile but I hadn't counted on the tough trail conditions.  The rain was heavy and I came up to Wise Shelter and stopped there for lunch.  Met a nice family out there for the weekend. Mom,Dad, and 2 kids. Grandmom even came along.  She was thinking of doing the AT next year.  I really have to give it to them, they were all upbeat despite the crazy heavy rain and they just put their ponchos back on and went right back into it! Just as I was about to put my pack back on, the rain started to come down in buckets so I decided to wait it out. I had only done 9.5 miles up to this point so I couldn't justify staying here for the night.  I put in another 6.5 and made it to Old Orchard Shelter.  On the way, I passed the best car campsite. It's called the Scales and was about 3 miles before the shelter. It was a fenced in meadow with a gate to the wild ponies and a bathroom!  I'd love to come here sometime and camp in style.  
I got set up here and had my dinner and it's only 7:00. As I was about to start the fire, it started drizzling again so I'll just skip it tonight.  I want to get to bed early so I can do a 23 mile day tomorrow and get to Partnership Shelter- there's a pizza place that will deliver there.

Slept great in the hammock last night, only hit the snooze button once.  I wanted to get an early start to do the 23+ miles to Partnership Shelter. I was on the trail by 7:15.  It was a little gloomy this morning with the overcast skies and thick rhododendrons blocking most of the light but it kept things cool.  
All the streams were running fast from the heavy rain yesterday so it was rock hopping across all of them.  Of course I didn't get water when I should have.  It was everywhere until I needed it.  I start everyday with a full load of water- 4 20oz bottles. I carry more than most people just because I don't feel like stopping to filter a bunch of times.  They normally last me till early afternoon but I drank them all by noon. I couldn't have lunch till I found the next stream.  Hit the stream at 1:30 and made lunch.  The sun had popped out just as I sat down to eat.  Tortilla with pepperoni, cheese, and mustard. I also got to soak my feet in the cold water for a few-  they get so sore (when they're not numb).
Started walking again after an hour and passed by an entrance register to a state forest.  Wouldn't you know, I'm only an hour or so behind Bearman.  I've been trying to catch him since Lisa dropped me off at Newfound Gap 2 weeks ago.  All of the shelters have notebooks in them and the hikers sign them and leave some messages for others behind them.  Bearman has been a day ahead of me at most, sometimes only a half a day.  Not for long.   
In the meantime, the sky opened up just as I was climbing up to the ridge of a mountain.  Thunder and some close lightning had me moving fast.  It didn't matter much to me, I knew I was getting cleaned up tomorrow and could dry everything out then.  
I got to Partnership Shelter around 5 and there was the Bearman along with a bunch of others I had met or heard about. Atlas from back in the Smokies was there also.  I met the Roadrunners, Snow, and Harambe. Everybody was extra happy because there are a few pizza places that deliver to the road crossing 50 yds up the trail.  I skipped the pizza cause I'm trying to lighten my food bag.  Besides, I'm staying in Atkins tomorrow and I'll get my pizza then.  It was like a party at the shelter.  There must've been 20 people here.  
I set up my hammock a little bit away from the crowds. I can watch a movie on my phone tonight since I'm charging everything up tomorrow.","Old Orchard Shelter

Slept great in the hammock as always and was packed up and on the trail by 7:30.  The plan was to get into Atkins for my resupply and to get a room to get showered and dry out all the wet gear.  I was having 2nd thoughts about spending another night indoors since everyone else was pushing on. I thought about just picking up my resupply and moving on but I couldn't miss out on that shower.  Besides, I had to charge my battery pack and phone.  
I got to an old schoolhouse (see pics) around 11:00 and there was a register in it- Sherlock and Baguette had been here at 8:30 and left a message for me.  I had good cell service so I texted them.  They were at the Barn Restaurant 3 miles up in Atkins.  I told them I would be there in about an hour and they said they would hang around.   
While I was at the schoolhouse, I met Beverly and Gary from Texas. They came up to me all excited and said ""Are you a real hiker?""  I had my pack and my smell to prove it.  They had so many questions about the trail and their excitement instantly cheered me up.  They were a very nice couple and I was happy to meet them.
I made it to The Barn and saw Sherlock and Baguette !! It was so great to see them and catch up on our adventures.  I hadn't seen them since Gatlinburg and so much had happened since then.  They were packing up a resupply that was mailed to the Barn and moving on a few miles up the trail. I'd like to catch back up with them and Bearman either tomorrow or the next day and cut the miles back a little.  There's plenty of time left to finish the trail and I've finally caught back up to my original trail bubble after my 6 day break last month.  
Had dinner at The Barn with Marathon who I'd met a couple days back.  He's just finishing up a section hike and headed back to FL in a couple days.

Had a nice big breakfast at the Barn and was on the trail by 7:45.  About 2 miles in, I caught up to Bearman and his group- Jenny, K Star, and Atlas (who I'd met in the Smokies). They keep a pretty fast pace and we passed the 1/4 mark around 9:00. It was a surprise to me- but a nice one.  So far I've used 29% of my time to do 25% of the trail but nothing to worry about. The bigger mile days are coming as the elevation levels off a bit.  As the group stopped for a snack break, I kept going.  I had that huge breakfast and wasn't ready for a break.  
The trail passed through some cow pastures and luckily they were far away. It was sunny and warm and the change of trail  is nice but I'd always rather be in the woods, the shade particularly.  You can feel the temp drop like 10 degrees immediately.  
My right achilles was sore all day and had me worried but I kept pushing on to the meeting point.  The last 1.8 made me regret going so far. When I got into camp, I was whooped.  Set up camp and scarfed down dinner and right to sleep.","Atkins VA

Woke up feeling good around 7. I was definitely a little worried about the achilles pain from yesterday so the plan was to walk at my own pace.  Bearman and the pack went on ahead of me while I packed up my stuff.  Made sure to stretch before taking off this morning.  30 minutes in and no heel pain, I think it healed overnight.  The weather was perfect again and the trail was nice and smooth, not flat, but smooth. Stopped for lunch at a shelter and met up with the pack.  They had planned on stopping after 4 more miles even though it was only 3:00.  I was feeling great and not in the mood to sit around till the sun went down so I pushed on.  The trail got even better and the legs were feeling good so I put in another 10 miles for a total of 25.3 - my highest total yet!  There was a big hill at the end of the day and I figured I'd rather do it now than 1st thing in the morning.  At the top of the hill were Sliced Beets and Yardsale.  I had heard of them and they heard of me but it's the 1st time we met.  They said that Sherlock and Baguette were just up ahead so I figured I'd walk a little more to see if I could catch them.  I found the perfect site and decided to stop right there. It overlooks a town in the valley and was just big enough for my hammock.  Set up, did chores and ate a nice dinner - and I wasn't too worn out.  Awesome day!","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Slept so god after the long day and woke up feeling fresh.  In about 30 minutes, I caught up with Sherlock and Baguette.  They were a bit surprised to see me so soon but we got to pass the 600 mile mark together!! The milestones are coming up quicker and quicker! We couldn't find a marker on the trail at 600 so Baguette made one for us.  We had a little snack break and pushed on.  I was undecided on my mileage for the day so I think I'll just stick with walking till I don't feel like it anymore.  
The trail was empty today. Other than Sherlock and Baguette, I only saw 1 other hiker, a section hiker named Twitch. He was headed towards Trent's Grocery before turning around  and doing the section north to Daleville so we chatted about the good campsites and water sources he'll see down the trail.  
The forecast had called for showers around 5 and it was beginning to cloud up but I wasn't done hiking for the day.  There was a big uphill I wanted to get out of the way today.  I hate leaving them for the morning.  1500'climb in 2 miles. Parts of it went straight up.  It was a tough one.  As soon as it leveled off I found a cleared out site and got set up. Just as I got my food line set up, the rain started.  I cooked my dinner of Ramen Supreme under my hammock and rain fly.  It was so good and I wasn't too exhausted even after another 25 mile day.  That only leaves 5.4 miles for tomorrow to get to Wood's Hole Hostel.","Stealth site mile 493.4

Short day today but not uneventful.  My rainfly came loose overnight and the rain came in the foot end of my hammock and soaked everything.  I thought I had just set up facing the wrong way and that the wind was blowing the rain in but when I got up, I realized the problem. No big deal because I'm heading into Wood's Hole Hostel where I can dry everything out, get a shower, clean laundry, and get a shuttle to town for resupply.  
The 5.4 miles went by quick and I was here by 10:30.  I need a day off my feet, they're getting very beat up by the long days. This is just the place to take a rest.
I got showered and set up my bunk and headed out to the Walmart in Pearisburg to get my resupply. I went there with Chicken Man (from Hopewell Twp NJ) and Neville, the hostel owner. Got enough stuff to top off my food bag (which keeps getting heavier). It turns out that Chicken Man was once the mayor of Hopewell Twp and he got an ordinance passed that allowed homeowners to own their own chickens on less than acre - no roosters though.  Very interesting guy.  He's heading southbound before flip-flopping and going from North Jersey to Katahdin. 
When we got back to the hostel, Katisa from Australia was here. Also Blue, Sherlock, and Baguette and a bunch of others I hadn't met yet. Honey Buns (MA), Walking Bear, Keith (IL), Kilometer, Camp and Dragon (Canada), and a couple from PA.   The hostel staff were great too. 
We all hung out in the bunkhouse and on the porch in rocking chairs looking at the incredible views from the porch (see pics).
We had a big family style dinner of salad, pumpkin lasagna, pork, and homemade ice cream for dessert.  All you could eat!!
Neville and Mike told the story of how the hostel came to be(very interesting and on their website- just look up Woods Hole Hostel).  These dinners really let you get to know the people you've been hiking with and they're such an important part of this whole experience.  Also, there's no wifi and poor cell service so everyone's not staring at their phones.  
We all help clean up after dinner and by now it's 8:30 and time to wrap things up before hiker midnight.  I have a very comfortable bed upstairs in the bunkhouse and Honey Buns even brought enough earplugs for everyone!! These low mile days go by so fast! 9:30, time for bed.","Tentsite mile 618.4

Early on, there were some nice look outs down to Pearisburg.  The only bad part was that I had to walk down into the valley just to walk back up the other side. It wasn't easy crossing the road that goes into town- the pull of the Dairy Queen was strong. But I had to be stronger.  Too bad the town was .9 miles down the road.  I just had a zero day, there's no way I could justify another short day and I couldn't be trusted to head back to the trail with a full belly and shower opportunity.

I'm trying to get more 25 mile days but they seem to be a challenge lately because of the trail conditions.  Sometimes the elevation profile looks good but it doesn't show the rocky conditions that really slow you down.  The plan today was to get 10 miles by 10:00.  I was in the trail by 6:15 and moving at a good pace.  I had 10.5 by 10:00!  Then the trail went bad and the rocks just beat me up.  I did happen to meet a father and son team that were out surveying the condition of the shelters in the area.  The father does repairs and maintenance to the shelters for a 100 or so mile section.   Unfortunately I didn't get their names but I did get to thank them for their volunteer work - it's a huge task.  
I got to Warspur Shelter around 6 and was totally beat.  Also, I had been out of water for a while. There was a stream by the shelter so I filled up and figured I'd have dinner and see about moving on.  It just wasn't happening.  I was wiped out - I think from the early start.  Katisa came in, then Bearman and the pack.

The alarm went off at 5:15 but it got shut off immediately.  Yesterday was a real ass kicker so I was not getting up early.  My theory of doing 10 x 10 didn't pay off like I had hoped.  I was just out of energy by 6 PM.  Packed up and on the the trail by 7:30.  I saw a bunch of people at the shelter that must've come in after I went to bed last night.  Crispy (formerly Mike) was there- I met him at the Visitor Center in GA when we were signing in as thru-hikers.  His buddy has gotten off the trail though.  
1st thing up was that huge climb that I couldn't do last night.  1000' in 1 mile- it doesn't sound too bad but the last half was straight up.  I was up on my toes for the last half mile.  The way down was steep and rocky also.  I stubbed my toes really hard on a rock and completely lost my temper.  I was so angry at the trail and I just flipped out.  My feet are so sore from the last few days and this section of trail just sucks!  I kept thinking- at least it's not raining.  Trying my best to stay upbeat. I stopped at the next shelter to check the register and found that a few other hikers had some trouble with the trail as well.  Made it down to the valley and crossed a huge pasture with the Keffer Oak.  It's a huge oak tree from the 1700's I believe.  Walking through these pastures, I saw the coolest homesteads with rolling hills of fresh cut grass and hay.  Such a beautiful area. 
As soon as I crossed the pasture and started heading up the next mountain, I must have crossed some geological boundary.  The trail became softer and no more of the jagged rocks.  It was like night and day. And the day just got better from there.  I met a bunch of hikers today, both north and south bound.  I walked with Sliced Beets for a while.  He was slack packing today so he was moving fast.  Slack packing is when someone drops you off at a road crossing and picks you up 20 or so miles at another road crossing.  All you have to carry are snacks and water so you can move pretty fast.  He's an interesting guy and he's about to flip flop up to Maine so he can hike with his daughter through the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  
I crossed VA 42 and headed up one last mountain for the day.  A 1500' climb over 2 miles.  It was tough and I was out of energy. All I could think about was dinner at the top.  I almost pulled over a few times to make my dinner but I didn't think I would finish the climb if I stopped.  As soon as I reached the top, I cooked up my Ramen dinner and scarfed it down.  My hunger is getting worse and worse.  I think about food at least half of the day and even dream about it.  I wake up with my stomach growling every morning.  I need to get to Daleville by Thursday or I will be completely out of food. It is nice to have a light food bag though.  
I'm set up on top of a 30' wide ridge.  I watched the sun go down on one side and may see it come up on the other but I'll probably sleep through that.

Today was going to be good no matter what.  I was heading into Daleville tomorrow so let it rain, hail, whatever. I can deal with almost anything for a day.  As it turns out, today was a perfect hiking day and all that punishing trail from the day earlier must've been payment for today.  The only concern I had was cutting down the miles I'll have to hike tomorrow to get into town.
I was on the trail by 7:30 and first up I met Snickers and Old School from Ohio, Alaska, and most recently in Florida.  They're trying to avoid a hot FL summer by hiking the trail- geniuses.
I was heading to Dragons Tooth at mile 700.1.  It's a huge jagged slab of rock that points straight up out of the cliff.  But just before I got there, I passed the 700 mile mark!! I didn't see any sign in the trail and I really didn't feel like making one. So I climbed to the top of Dragons Tooth.  It was easy getting up there, the knees got a little shaky coming down though.  I'm still on my 1st pair of shoes and the tread has worn completely off so I was a little extra careful coming down. 
I had my lunch at the trail junction and spoke with Snickers and Old School some more. They are an adventure couple. On my way down the trail, there was a couple (Moses & Becky from N VA) that had a bag full of Reese's cups- but just for thru-hikers.  My 1st trail magic!! I was happy to help lighten her pack!! 
Just as the rocks were becoming a burden again, I crossed through some nice rolling cow pastures and got a little sun.  
Another 1st today- I saw a bear at mile 708, about a half mile from a parking area.  He came running out of the brush and headed up the trail in front of me.  I stood there for a second and wondered if I could keep going without making him feel threatened so I started walking again.  Just as I came around the corner, there he was.  I went to get my phone to take a pic but he looked up at me so I just stayed still till he ran off again. 
As I came out to the area, there were a group of ladies who asked if there was anything close up the trail worth walking to and said Yea - if you'd like to see a bear, he's only half a mile up.  I think they changed their mind.  So they asked where I was headed and I told them Maine and I love the reaction of people who haven't heard of thru-hikers.  It's awesome to see their expressions when I tell them I started in GA. It never gets old.   
As we're chatting, it turns out they're from Bucks Co. PA.  They were cool as hell and it turns out they were on their own adventure. Going to their friends wedding and touring some wineries.
After that, it was on my way to McAfee Knob- the most photographed spot on the AT.  It's a rock ledge that you can dangle your feet over.  The views were incredible! The pictures just can't capture it.  While I was up there, I met some people from Pitman, small world! I also crossed paths with Dragon and Camp again.  I also made my dinner up there and ate with the best view ever. 
Lately, it seems that my best miles come after dinner so my plan was to walk till the sun went down.  I got about 6 or 7 more miles in and set up on a ridge just as the sun went down. 
12 miles and change to get to Daleville and a shower!!! My food bag is just about empty too so it worked out pretty well this time.","Tentsite mile 691.5

Slept so good after a nice long day yesterday it was hard to get out of the hammock but today is town day and that got me out.  Check in time at the Howard Johnson Express is noon so I had to walk at 3 MPH to get my money's worth!  
1st up today was Tinker Cliffs.  They are on the opposite side of the valley from McAfee Knob and I could see where I walked last night as the sun went down.  I followed the ridge down from the knob and I could almost pinpoint where I camped last night. 
The trail runs right along the edge of the cliffs and it's just outright dangerous- you can't look at the amazing view and the trail at the same time. I had to stop at least 20 times to take pics and just take in that view.  It's a perfect little town in the valley. Surrounded by mountains on both sides and Roanoke right on the other side to the north.  
About 5 miles from town, I met Jeff who was just out for a day hike and was ready to head back towards town.  He's a teacher/counselor from a local high school and had a bunch of questions about the trail.  He also shared about his adventures in Mozambique in the late 80's.  as we're walking along, we came across Susan(?) and Gary, another local couple out for a day hike and as I'm walking up, she has her hand out with a big half orange in it!! 
I was out of breakfast and snacks and it was hot out so the orange was sooooo good!! They were a nice couple and Jeff and I chatted with them for a good 20 minutes.  They even insisted that I take the other half of the orange (which I couldn't resist- my manners have gone out the window).  
Jeff and I continued walking down the trail and before I knew it, I was in Daleville.  Thanked Jeff for the good conversation and headed towards the Howard Johnsons.  Got all checked in and cleaned up and headed to the plaza for food, the outfitters, and grocery store.
I stopped at a coffee shop as well and met about 20 more hikers from a bubble that's ahead of me.  The whole plaza is full of dirty smelly smiling hikers and it's a blast!!
Did my laundry and chores and headed back to the plaza for dinner.  I met up with Katisa and a British couple (Tom and Max) I've crossed paths with a few times. Also joining us was the family from Woods Hole Hostel that I met last week- Adi, Anatika, and Dale.  We had an awesome dinner (see pics) and chatted till after 9:00. Again, this is why the town stops are so awesome.

Slept good in the air conditioned room so it was tough getting up.  I also still had some town chores to take care of so I ended up not leaving town till around 11:00.  I had to mail back some stuff that I had been carrying but not using to make room for my enormous food bag.  I'm hoping to make it all the to Waynesboro, 130 miles away, without a food resupply. 
I'm hoping for 6 days but it will be close.  
I had 1 last cup of coffee from the shop and headed out.  2 miles out of town I crossed 1/3 mark at mile 730.1!
It got dark and cloudy very quickly and it sounded like a waterfall below me when it actually was a wall of rain.  Heavy, cool, drenching rain.  It felt pretty good to cool off and it stopped after about an hour so it didn't really have time to become a nuisance.  I hiked on till about 7:00 and wanted to have dinner and set up camp.  I came across the perfect 1 person campsite complete with fire ring, log bench, and a pile of sticks to burn!  I set up my hammock, got the fire going, and made my dinner.  It was so relaxing and I got all my stuff done and cleaned up just as the sun went down.  
***just a note about the mileages....
I use the AT Hiker App by Guthook and it uses GPS to give me my exact location. That is how I know where I camp each night.  Lately, I've been staying in campsites that aren't listed or aren't even really campsites.  I can set up my hammock anywhere there are 2 trees at the right distance.  The app is amazing and works even without a cell signal. I keep my phone in airplane mode to save battery and the app still works using GPS.

Tentsite at mile 746.8 to Thunder Ridge Shelter 
I was really happy with my tentsite from last night. I even had a deer walk right through.  It was a little foggy this morning with the clouds blowing right through the trees.  I came out at a road crossing and it turns out that it's the Blue Ridge Parkway.  It reminded me of Shenandoah and even had the cement mile marker posts and car pull offs for the overlooks.  As I looked around the woods, they reminded me of Shenandoah as well and I felt like I was almost there. I've been looking forward to Shenandoah as a thru-hiker for some unknown reason so it cheered me up a bit.  
As the morning went on, the weather was trying to clear up.  I came out at another road crossing and the wea. ther to the west was clear and sunny while the weather to the east was cloudy and you couldn't see the valley (see pics). 
Passed by a shelter around noon and decided to stop in for lunch. Met up with Sliced Beets and Dragon and Camp.  Dragon and Camp are excited because today is Canada Day and they are heading into a campground at the next road crossing to have a party.  I would like to go but I have to get to Waynesboro and I just came out of town yesterday. 
I came out to the next road crossing and there was a big swimming hole.  Crispy was there with his girlfriend Cameron and his father who had been meeting him all along the trail. There were also a father and son who were camping nearby and planned to camp there all summer long.  
As I was putting on my shoes and socks I was tempted to head to the campground and take the rest of the day off but luckily Dragon and Camp hadn't made it to the road crossing before I got back on the trail. Next up was a 3+ mile climb with 2100' climb.  I just wanted to get it over with so I put my head down and dug in.  I was a sweaty mess by the time I got to the top and it was time for dinner.  Stopped at Cornelius Creek Shelter to make my Ramen dinner and rest the feet.  I was feeling good and wanted to hike late tonight to make up some miles from my short day yesterday.  I still had a 1.2 mile, 900' climb ahead.  That's 3000' plus all the dips.  Sometimes even when the trail is going up overall, there are dips that are just added elevation.  I hate going down when the map says you're going up- you always have to make it up.  
On the last climb, my left ankle/shin started aching real bad. Not sure if it's a cramp or a tendon thing.  Either way, there goes my long night hike.  Hopefully a good nights rest will do the trick.  It's amazing how much you can heal overnight.  I've gone to bed with terrible Achilles pain, all better in the morning.  Sore knees, all better in the morning.  Bad foot pain as well, all better in the morning.
I was hoping to get 30 miles today, now I don't even think I'll get 25. My food will not last till Waynesboro at this rate.  We'll just see how I feel in the morning.","Tentsite at mile 746.8

Didn't want to get up today.  The heat was a killer yesterday and today's forecast was for another scorcher.  As The heat gets worse, so do the bugs and I was getting swarmed by biting gnats and mosquitoes before my hammock was even packed up. The trail conditions in the morning were much better though. I had a nice fairly level trail for about 5 miles and made really good time until I came across a huge rattlesnake sitting right across the trail. I told him to move but he wasn't listening.   I tapped his rattle with my hiking pole and he just took a big breath and scared the hell out of me. I tried tossing some rocks his way, still no luck. He coiled up but never rattled.  I finally got the nerve to flip him off the trail with my hiking pole and run past. Less than  .2 miles away, I passed a couple girls and warned them about the pissed off snake just up ahead and told them to be careful.
I was looking at the elevation of the trail ahead on my app and noticed that I had another 3+ mile, 2100' climb.  It took all the energy right out of me and I hadn't even climbed it yet.  I also realized that I didn't have enough food to make it to Waynesboro so I will have to get off trail at either Glasgow or 25 miles further in Buena Vista.  The heat made the decision easy- today was the day.  That lifted my spirits immediately.   
About 15 minutes down the trail, I came across a big stream with a deep pool and waterfall.  I didn't have to make big miles anymore today so I was taking time for a soak. The water was perfect. Left my sweat soaked clothes on so I could rinse them out.  I sat in the water for a good half hour while the minnows nibbled on my toes and ankles. I even managed to kill a big horsefly that landed on my arm and watched the little fish fight over it.  I could've sat there all day but I was looking forward to a shower and more town food.  
1.7 miles later, I was at the trailhead and go figure- no cell service!  I sent out a text and walked around with my phone in the air hoping it would go through.  2 minutes later I got a reply. Bob was on his way!!
Showered, clean laundry, and a full belly!!

Town days always go by fast and yesterday was no exception.  Stanimals was a nice surprise mostly because of Bob and Donna, the caretakers.  Bob runs the shuttles and Donna takes care of the guests.  I liked them a little extra because they were from Philly too-they still had the accents.  The place was newly redone and had great wifi, a nice tv, and a row of recliners in the living room. We had a nice group there as well, all hikers I hadn't met before.  All but 1 were sections hikers and the only other thru had to take a bus back to PA to deal with some pending business.  
So Bob dropped me off at the trailhead with Bumblebee and her mom, Just Helen. I had to get that huge climb in first thing while the temps were still cool.  It wasn't too bad at all with fresh legs and I was at the top in no time. I was already a sweaty mess and the town shower was a distant memory. At the top, I could see the Doppler radar that I passed 2 nights ago, about 20 trail miles away.  I could also see the foot bridge over the James River (see pics).  
Just after lunch I passed the 800 mile mark!! These markers are just flying by!! I also met Breeze (thru-hiker from '91) and his son Little Ralphie who's thru-hiking this year.  They were busy celebrating 800 with a couple tall boys so I pushed on.  At the parking area, I met Blue Sky- wife/mother of the 2 guys I just mentioned and we chatted a bit till she offered me some nice cold fresh fruit- a trail luxury.  I must look really pathetic now that strangers offer me food all the time.  I have dropped to 175 and have been able to keep it there for a couple weeks.  I really don't want to lose anymore.  I've met people that just keep on losing and they get pretty week and really have to focus on getting more calories.  I'm glad I don't have that added pressure.  
I got to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter around 6 and was feeling good so I pushed on and figured I would take a chunk out of tomorrow's huge climb by getting started tonight.  It's a 2900' climb over 4 miles.  I managed to knock off 1500' over 2 miles and was getting nervous as it was getting late and there were no campsites.  The terrain was so steep and there were no clearings for me to set up.  The trail leveled off for a bit so I  bushwhacked through some heavy growth to get to spot and set up my hammock. Cooked and ate and now I'm all comfy and in my clean clothes, rubbing my cramped up feet.  The people at the hostel were explaining how our condition is called Christmas toe because we won't get the feeling back in our toes till at least Christmas.  I'm 53 miles outside of Waynesboro and the southern entrance to Shenandoah.  I'm pretty confident that I'll get there by early Thursday.  I had planned on taking a 0 there, but if I can get there early enough maybe I'll just head out the next day.  We'll see- I'm still terrible at planning my destinations and figuring out my food needs.  The trail is just too unpredictable.  And I guess I am as well.

Thru hikers sign the register with their ""confessions"".  Mostly about bad behavior on the trail or chasing female hikers.  Some were pretty funny.  Loon seeker showed up with his dog and began to set up in the shelter.  I was going to stay but the area had litter everywhere and for some reason bees were covering everything that wasn't moving.  They swarmed my shoes and covered my hiking poles when I set them down.  That and the sign on the fire pit warning about a large rattlesnake under the shelter floor.  Ate my dinner and headed out.  I was hoping to find a spot on a ridge where I might be able to see some fireworks in a nearby town.  Found my spot about a mile past the shelter but it was raining off and on.  Just set up the hammock and called it a day.","Tentsite at mile 808.3

For some reason I didn't want to bother anyone so I got an Uber to town and the hotel.  I went to the front desk and told them my friends were expecting me but the only names I could give them were trail names - not so helpful.  I asked if she knew Laz E Boy or Siesta?  No?  How bout Krazy Korean and Dirtbag?  No??

I should've used the list yesterday when I got to the road crossing but I felt strange calling a complete stranger and asking for a ride.  I used Uber instead.  The town is actually 3 miles from the trail and I'm not big on walking miles that don't count.  $6.00 was a small price to pay to save my pride.  Not even 15 minutes into SNP, we saw a mamma and cub.

Awesome nights sleep. People started stirring around 6:30 so it was time to get moving. All I could think about was getting some coffee at the Loft Mountain campstore 7.5 miles away.  I got there around 10:30 and Siesta was there already.  Eating and drinking a beer he found in the hiker box.  It turns out that someone left a cold 6 pack in the hikers box?!?  I can only think that someone was leaving the campground and didn't want to take them home or it was an elaborate trap by the store keeper to bait hikers into staying for a while.  In any case, it worked because as I sat there, more and more hikers came in and before we knew it, it was a party.  The cashier was out chatting with everyone and 1 couple even decided to stay the night at the campground.  I ended up hanging around for about 2 hours and just had to throw my pack on and get back on the trail or I may have stayed there the whole night as well.  
A couple miles in, the trail crossed Skyline Drive at Ivy Creek Overlook and I had a chance to talk with some tourists and answer some questions.  Just as they left, Laz E Boy and Siesta walked up and we got some trail magic from Stump ('01 thru-hiker).  She had cold soda and a couple beers.  This is an awesome place to hang out.  Laz E Boy and Siesta had room for another beer each and I was lucky enough to grab the soda.  Laz E Boy said he was smashed already and it's only like 1 in the afternoon!!

Late start today.  I was waiting to hear the other guys get up before I moved and when I checked my phone for the time- it was already 7:40!! Too late for me but I guess my body needed the rest.  We didn't really have a plan for the day, just kind of figured we'd end up where we end up. The only ""must stop"" was at the Big Meadows Wayside which is basically just a diner.  Stopped by the Lewis Mountain camp store for coffee and lunch after about 10 miles.  While I was there, I met Kristin, Kevin, and Paul. They were section hiking the south 50 miles of Shenandoah and had just finished.  They looked so happy to be done and were recapping their adventure.  They seemed like a fun group. 
Laz E Boy came up and had lunch too then we pushed on.  The next 10 miles were some of the best trail conditions I've ever seen.  Flat, smooth, and even mowed on the sides. I had a bear run across the trail about 15 yards ahead of me and so I moved a bit slower for a minute.  When I got to the spot, I was hoping to get a picture of him but he was gone- no noise or anything.  
The weather has been perfect the last couple of days- sunny and cool.  The thermometer said 68 while I was having lunch at Lewis Mt and it didn't get much warmer all day.  Every once in a while I get a glimpse into the valley or across to the other mountains and it's just incredible.  I've hiked down into those wilderness areas over the years with my other hiking crew buddies from home.  I'd like to give a shout out to Wallace, Karl, and Ed.  We've had some epic trips down in the blue blaze areas where the elevation is tough and it's easy to take a wrong turn now and again.  
We finally made it to the wayside and it was a burger, fries, and ice cream for me. We hung out at the picnic table for a good 90 minutes and didn't feel like going anymore for the day. We called the lodge to see if we could get a good rate for a room but they wanted way too much.  The trail ended up snaking around the campground and Laz E Boy had made up his mind that he wasn't moving anther foot so we set up in an empty campsite and we're done for the day. As a little bonus for the end of the day, we saw a mamma bear with 2 cubs off in the bushes. She was walking steady while the cubs would stop to play, then run to catch up.

Huge day today. Painful too.  The feet seem to be getting worse, especially the right foot.  It's ok though because Lisa is coming to visit this weekend and I'll have a couple days off the trail to let them heal. 
Back to today.  My plan was to get to Skyland (7.5 miles away) as early as possible to get some coffee.  I've become a coffee junkie.  I normally don't think about it when I'm on the trail but lately even just the possibility of coffee has me running down the trail, knocking people out of the way.  Today makes 3 days in a row for morning coffee.  I made it to Skyland by 9:30 and everything was good in the world.  Laz E Boy and Siesta stopped in also.  They were more interested in the breakfast buffet though.  
We hung around enjoying the morning way too long and didn't get back on trail till around 11.  
The bears are out in Shenandoah!  I've seen them everyday.  Some better than others.  The younger bears don't even run away, they'll just stare at you while you walk by.  
We were eating a late lunch at the Pinnacles Picnic Area and Siesta got the idea to try to make it to Elkwallow  before they close at 6:00 but the only problem was that it was just under 16 miles away and it was already 1:30.  I knew I had no shot- the feet were just too sore but I told them to order me a burger if they make it in time.  They were motivated. And only 15 minutes late.  They got there at 6:15 and the place was locked.  I was lucky to make it there at all. I think I got in around 7:20.  I just made my dinner at the picnic table and called it a night.  Nobody feels like walking another step so we're camped in the woods right by the parking lot.  The new plan is to sleep in (the Wayside doesn't open till 9), get some breakfast from the wayside, and take an easy day to just outside Front Royal.  We'll camp 3 miles from town and get there early Wednesday.  I think my plan to get to Harper's Ferry by Friday just changed.  That's ok, the body needs a rest- I haven't had a day off in over 2 weeks!  Today was a new record for me- 26.2 miles.","Big Meadows Campground

We slept in today because the Wayside doesn't open until 9:00 and there was no way we were leaving without a breakfast sandwich and some coffee.  We got a little talking to by a ranger for camping too close to the Wayside. We were supposed to be 1/4 mile away but I pretty much limped in last night and don't think I had another 1/4 mile in me.  He was cool about it and let us off with a warning.  
We were 19 miles away from Front Royal and could make it there in 1 day but it's never worth it to get into town late so we decided to do 16 and then a short day into town.  It's a good thing it was a short day- my feet are getting worse and my left achilles has been sore for a few days now.  I'm literally limping into town for some time off.  
We had some nice trail on the way out of Shenandoah and it was sad to leave but it's always nice getting ready to get into town. We took a lot of long breaks today and Siesta had a few siestas.  No bears today also, which was a first since we entered Shenandoah.  
We got to the Tom Floyd Wayside which is just a shelter (no coffee or burgers at this one). I have no idea why they even call it a Wayside!  
It's been threatening thunderstorms most of the afternoon and has gotten pretty humid.  You hope for rain on days like this.  
We made dinner and are all excited about getting to town early tomorrow- I even made the reservations at the Mountain Home Cabbin.  He said we can get there as early as we like.  We may show up at 7 AM!   
I was in my hammock at 7:45 and asleep before 9:00.   The plan is to leave tomorrow morning at 7 and be there by 8:30.","Elkwallow Wayside

Tom Floyd Wayside to Mountain Home Cabbin
A town day was long overdo! The feet and now the ankle are starting to worry me, it's definitely time for a couple days of rest.  We were up at 6 and on the trail before 7 to get to the Mountain Home Cabbin.  It's a newer hostel run by Scott ('12 sobo thru-hiker) and his wife. It's on an historic piece of property about 50 yds from the trail. I'd like to do more research on the history of the place when I have better internet.  The hostel building itself is a 2 story brick building with 4 beds upstairs and a kitchen and 2 double beds downstairs. Pretty tiny but the AC was working good and the place was spotless!  Some people just know how to do hostels. It also helps to have good house mates and the 3 of us were joined by Barefoot.  A 6'5"" giant who was even more oversized due to the low ceilings.   After getting cleaned up, we took an Uber downtown about 5 miles away.  We had double servings of breakfast and walked around the historic part of town. We were so happy to be clean and fed. We all needed the rest as well  I'm doing everything I can to slow these guys down while I take my days off with Lisa- I really don't feel like chasing them for another 600 miles. It may all be for nothing anyway since Siesta is planning on heading up to Maine to avoid the heat. It's not a bad idea but I really want to be at the sign on Katahdin at the end. We'll just have to see what happens. I still haven't mastered the planning side of this trip so why start now.","Tom Floyd Wayside

Quick Start,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572764,"Today was the 1st of 3 planned 0 days with Lisa.  I had hoped to make it to Harper's Ferry but the body did not cooperate.  No problem, Front Royal is an historic little town which should help limit my walking during my days off the trail.  Instead of posting 3 separate entries for time off the trail, I'll just sum it all up in this one.  There is a heat wave going on down here so I wasn't planning on spending too much time outdoors.  Lisa and I went to the center of town where we ran into Hot Sauce and Lanta. I met Lanta on the summit of Springer Mt. on day 1 so it's nice to keep bumping into old acquaintances.  As Lisa and I returned to the hotel, we met a couple that was just heading to their room.  Lisa mentioned that I was hiking the trail and the guy replied that he had hiked in 2011.  I asked him what his trail name was and he says ""Rusty Bumper"".  I freaked out!! I said ""I know you!!"". I read his journal as he was hiking back in 2011!! His journal is in my top 3 all time list.  If you get a chance, type his name in the search bar and read it.  His adventure has an extra little twist and I'm not going to play spoiler.  In an effort to reduce my pack weight and morning pack up time, I had asked Lisa to bring some of my other equipment down with her.  I'm swapping out my hammock for my ultralight Zpacks duplex tent.  This will also allow me to get rid of my rainfly and one of my quilts which will free up space in my pack as well.  She also brought an older pair of Merril boots.  The trail runners I picked up back in Daleville have not been good to me at all.  The right heel got punctured and is creating a holes in my socks. I've also had increased foot pain since switching to them which may or may not be caused by them but in any case, something needs to be done.  The rocks seem to poke right through the bottom causing bruising and swelling so I need a more durable sole.  Lisa and I took a road trip up to Harper's Ferry to drop off my next resupply and to meet Siesta and Laz E Boy at the ATC Headquarters.  The ATC Headquarters is the ""psychological"" half way point of the trail (the actual halfway point is about another 65 miles in the middle of the woods) and also a visitor center with info about the trail and a hikers lounge in the back.  Hikers also get their pictures taken and placed in the album with their new hiker number on it. When we got there, Siesta and Barefoot were already in the lounge and had their ceremonial pictures taken and added to the album.  Laz E Boy came in shortly after and we all went out to the local pizza place for lunch.  Lisa was also able to be a trail angel and shuttle the guys around town for some errands.  Siesta is planning to take some time off the trail and do a flip flop hike (heading up to Maine and hiking south, back to Harper's Ferry).  Laz E Boy and Barefoot are going to keep heading north so it may be a while before I catch back up to them.Feeling good after 3 days off the trail so we'll see how it goes from here.","Mountain Home Cabbin

Horseshoe pit, covered gazebo, Adirondack chairs on the deck!! And the place was spotless too! Too bad it's only 1:00, there are some nice tent sites here as well.  As I walked up, I noticed another hiker there taking pictures.  As we were chatting, he asked me if I was from New England -  he thought I had that accent.  I told him no, I'm from South Jersey.  He said he was too.  It turns out he's from Pitman - the 2nd person I've met from Pitman!  His name is Kyle (trailname Stumbles) and he's friends with Lisa's children!  Small world.  He had been hiking with a group I had met earlier so we got to catch up on the status of our mutual hiker friends.  After lunch, the plan was to move at an easy pace to make it to Dick's Dome Shelter.  The heat was getting bad and I'm going to have to figure out how to deal with it.  It's only going to get worse as the elevation drops and we move deeper into July.  Luckily the trail levels off a bit after Harper's Ferry so there wont be the huge climbs.  The trail was mostly uneventful and I made it to the shelter around 6:30.  Stumbles was there along with 2 section hikers.  I was trying a new dinner tonight.  The Ramen supreme concoction I've been making seems a little too unhealthy to be eating 4 out of 5 nights a week so I was making penne with onion, garlic, parmesan, and olive oil.  I had bought the supplies on my 0 days to try to eat fresher on the trail.  It's a little tougher cooking in the pot as opposed to just boiling water and pouring it over the Ramen noodles but this is how a lot of people do it, I may as well learn how.  The meal turned out very well and I think I'll do this again.  The next chore was setting up my tent for the 1st time in a while.  This was a bad shelter for tents.  All the sites were sloped and full of rocks.  I finally found a spot away from the shelter area and set up.  The tent goes up fast and easy - less than 5 minutes.  Inflated my sleeping pad and settled in for the night.  Let's see if I sleep as good as I normally do in my hammock.","Front Royal

Quick Start,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572942,"I was very happy with the way I slept in the tent last night.  Wasn't sure how it was going to go with the rocky camp site and all but the air pad worked great!  The plan for the day is to get through the ""Roller Coaster"".  It's a 13 mile stretch of trail with a series of steep ascents and descents and NO views.  I've done this section before on a southbound section hike and don't remember it being all that tough.  It was also in April and was raining so it wasn't that fun either.  
It took me a while to pack up this morning because I was starting a new routine with the tent and pad instead of the hammock and rainfly.  I'll have to get better because it took me almost an hour to get on trail.  The humidity was already up and I was sweating in minutes even though the trail was good.  I caught up with Stumbles and saw him looking at the ground.  I thought he found a snake or something.  What he was looking at was the 1000 mile marker in the trail!!!! Woooohoooo!!! It is ridiculous to think that I've walked a thousand miles.  The first few hundred mile markers came so slow, but now they're just flying by!  After around 5 miles, I saw the sign for the start of the roller coaster.  I looked at the app to see how many hills there were so I could count them down.  There were about 12 hills - no problem.  I was whooped after the 1st!!  The heat and humidity were killing my energy.  About halfway up the 2nd hill, I laid down and took a 45 minute nap.  Woke up feeling refreshed and continued up the hill.  I had lunch by a stream and got to soak my feet in the cold water, it was so refreshing.  Continuing on the roller coaster, I was a sweaty mess in minutes and decided to head to the Bear's Den Hostel.  It's .1 off the trail and allows me to split up the roller coaster.  In the morning I'll have about 4 miles left and I'll tackle it before it gets too hot and humid.  Now that my plan was shortened, I really didn't have to push the pace at all.  It's a good thing too because I didn't have the energy.  
I walked up to the entrance of the hostel and was greeted by 1 of the volunteers.  He led me inside to the desk where I registered. $23 got me a bunk, shower, and laundry.  Stumbles was here already along with Casper (NOBO) and Nomad (SOBO).  1st order of business is always the shower - especially on a day like this!!  And just like that, everything is good again!!  Did laundry and ate down some weight from my food bag.  They also had a piano and guitar here so I got to make some noise for a bit.  
Casper is from Germany and she has until October 8th to finish before her visa runs out so she is pretty motivated to move on quick.  Nomad is from Massachusetts and is flying down the trail.  His biggest day was just under 60 miles!! I don't even know how that is possible but I'm sure he had a day or two off after that.  I have no interest in doing anything near that mileage.  I would like to hit 30 one day though.  It should be possible in the flatter terrain of MD or Southern PA.

Harper's Ferry 
I've just come to accept that my body can't recover from the daily beating caused by this heat/humidity.  Luckily it's just the heat that is the problem.  My feet and achilles are feeling better everyday.  So I spent all day and night trying to formulate a plan to beat this heat.  Starting earlier in the day, hiking at night, lowering my mileage, trying to wait it out.  Unfortunately, all of those options don't sound like a good time and why am I out here if not to have some enjoyment.  I get it, not everyday can be Disneyland but there is no need to suffer excessively either.  The forecast for the next week or so has the temps at 90+ every single day.  The plan now is to surrender to the heat.  It wins.  I'm going to flip flop and go to the northern end and hike south to Harper's Ferry to complete the trip.  It wasn't easy coming to this decision.  I really wanted to see that Katahdin sign in the end but I've adjusted my mindset.  After all, it's the journey not the destination.  And why not make the journey as good as possible! It turns out I'm not the only one with this plan.  At least half of the hikers I spoke with at the ATC headquarters were doing the same thing.  As I was trying to figure out how to get to Mt. Katahdin, Krazy Korean said he was going up there in a car and had a spot left and that I was welcome to join them but I have to stop home and see a doctor before getting back on the trail.  I should be getting back on the trail around the same time as him and his group so we'll probably cross paths again. I'm actually kind of excited to be on a different adventure.  I've always followed NOBOs so I always had an idea what to expect going north.  Going south just feels like a whole new trip for some reason.  
So I waited for Sherlock and Baguette to make it to the ATC in Harper's Ferry and as I told them my plans, Baguette gave me this steely eyed glare.  She heard me say that I was getting on the train but didn't hear the rest.   That I was continuing up to Maine and heading south. It was a scary look that I will never forget. They did their half way point picture and got their resupply all in order and we went out for one more dinner together.  We had such a great time and I'm gonna miss them.  We really bonded early on the trip and it's hard to split up from them but we will cross paths again as I go south and they go north.  
   There is a lot of work to do to plan my travel to Mt. Katahdin.  It's not the easiest place to get to by public transportation.  I also have to make up more resupply boxes and see a doctor before I get back on the trail.  
Im so excited to get up to Maine and the Whites in NH. One other bonus is that I'm still in trail shape so I'm just jumping up to the more demanding parts of the trail before I get spoiled by the relatively flat mid Atlantic states. It will also be much easier to get home from Harper's Ferry at the end.  There are a whole new group of hikers to meet up there and towns to stop in.  Let's hope for cool temps and low humidity.","Harper's Ferry

Home to Maine
The trek up to Maine has been an adventure all in itself.  Beginning at 11:25 PM last night, I've been on 3 buses (Philadelphia, New York, Boston) just to get to Portland ME.  As of now (12:00PM) I still have 2 more to get to Medway which is just outside of Millinocket.  As soon as I get to Medway, I'll call the Appalachian Trail Lodge to shuttle me to their hostel.  Straight to bed and at the trailhead by 6:30AM. The mountain already has me worried with 4000' of climbing in 5.1 miles! Only after that will the miles count towards my thru-hike.  The great thing about the rest of my trip is that there is no pressure to be anywhere by any specific time.  No rush to finish before the mountain closes and no groups to try to catch up to.  Lisa and I don't have any plans to meet for this section either, it's just too tough splitting up after her visits.  I'm also trying to approach the trail differently.  I've maxed out my daily miles on the southern portion and feel like I've reached my limit at around 25 miles per day so now the focus is going to be on slowing down a bit.  There is no need to stumble into camp exhausted from rushing all day, I'm sure I'll be wiped out from the difficult terrain instead.  I've also repacked my bag and my new weight with 4 days of food and water is 24lbs.  Hopefully the lighter weight will be easier on the knees and feet.
At the bus station in Boston, I ran into Sunset. I 1st met her in Damascus at the church hostel and I saw her last week in Harper's Ferry on the train to D.C.

Mt Katahdin to Katahdin Stream Campground
1st day back on the trail and the climb up Katahdin is here!! This climb has been on my mind the entire time I was off trail.  I had a hard time sleeping last night, the anxiety was a surprise.  That and I finally relented and started watching the last season of House of Cards.  I got through 5 or 6 episodes on my 0 Day at the lodge but now I'm stuck- I have 4 more episodes stored on my phone but I have to be very careful with my battery until I get through the 100 mile wilderness.  
Ole Man shuttled me, Sunset, Plant, Cloudview, Oh Lordie, and Swamp Fox to the ranger station at the campground so we could register for our hike.  On the drive, he gave us a mile by mile description of what to expect on our climb, it was all very helpful info.  Overall, it was 4200' of ascent over 5.2 miles.  Definitely the single biggest climb I've ever done.
 I was AT hiker 1025 to climb Katahdin this season and the major northbound bubbles haven't even arrived yet.  There has been talk that the rangers are only going to allow 1500 or 2000 AT hikers to Summit this year which has a lot of people worried that they could be turned back if they don't get here on time.  That thought was in the back of my mind as well but not anymore.  I'm in no rush at all. 
I set off on the Hunt Trail at 8:10.  It was nice and sunny and cool.  The trail wound through the pines and crossed a couple streams before the climbing started.  It was a gentle climb up to Katahdin Stream Falls and then the trail turned upwards.  First it was just rock slide, then it turned into hand over hand rock climbing.  There were ledges and cliffs and was surprisingly more dangerous than I was expecting.  This is where we went above treeline. As soon as the trees were gone, the winds picked up and were gusting pretty heavily.   Overall, it was 2 miles of rock climbing. The clouds had come in and limited the views for the 2nd half of the climb.  When I got to the tablelands at 3.6 miles, visibility was only about 50 feet.  I stayed on the trail and put my head down.  Another 1.6 miles and I could see a group of people around the Katahdin sign.    
It was a nice feeling to be at the top but a little different from what I had imagined when I thought my hike would end here.  I did get to see some thru-hikers finish their journeys and I must admit I was a little bit jealous.  I waited my turn to get my picture taken on the sign then had some lunch of leftover pizza.  The clouds and fog had cleared completely while I was eating and the views became incredible!!  I could see the trail along the tablelands where I had walked up and there were huge lakes in every direction in the valley.  I had another picture taken with the nice weather and started heading down.  I was dreading the downhill a little bit.  People had mentioned that this is an ""asskicker"". There was even a southbounder at the AT Lodge who ended his hike after doing just Katahdin.  He said his knees were shot and I can remember how that feels.  I ask met Tipperary on the way down.  He's a  NOBO that just finished his hike and we ended up walking down together.  He's from Ireland but living in Bermuda for a while now and you could tell he was anxious to get home to the nice weather- you could even say he was rubbing it in a little to the other hikers he knew. He would say he was going home to go scuba diving and tell everyone ""have a nice rest of your life"".  He was a good guy and it was a quick hike down with the company.  Before I knew it, I was at the ranger station swapping out my gear from the day pack I used.  The campground has a bin full of loaner day packs so you don't have to carry all your stuff to the top.  I should've taken my extra stuff and put it in the daypack, left that at the ranger station,  and carried my own pack up there. I didn't realize this till I was already a mile up the trail.  Anyway, I signed back in and Tipperary headed off to the Birches Campsite, but not before I got a quick ""have a nice rest of your life"" in. (He has a journal online as well).
Luckily, as I was on my way down, I ran into Sherlock(a different one) and Darwin.  They were able to reserve a campsite and had space for 4 more hikers. They offered me a spot which I gratefully accepted. My only other option was to hike another 10 miles to the next shelter- that was not happening. 
I got back to the campground around 3:30 and started a fire to get rid of the bugs.  I had time to set up and eat dinner as the others began to return.  Plant and Cloudview decided to spend the night so we had room for 1 more.  Sunset had us all a little worried when she wasn't back at dark but the ranger said not to worry.   She came rolling in at 10:00PM- that's 14 hours round trip!!! She set up without waking anyone.  I have a whole new respect for her. I saw so many people that had turned around before it got too tough and she powered on to get her picture at the sign. I will post it as soon as I get it from her.

Katahdin Stream Campground to Hurd Brook Leanto
It's ridiculous how early the sun comes up here!  It was full light by 4:30 this morning.  In VA, the sun was coming later and later which was much appreciated.  Not only that, it was in the 40's this morning!! Not complaining, just a little surprised.  Even with the early sunrise, I decided to sleep in.  No need to rush out in the morning to beat the heat.  I rolled out of the tent about 7 and was on the trail by 7:30.  The elevation profile is showing very level conditions but it's the roots and rocks that will slow me down here.  Abol Bridge Campground is 9.9 miles away and I'm already looking forward some coffee.  The trail through Baxter State Park is beautiful.  The trail twists and turns through thick pines and it's nice and soft where the roots aren't sticking out.  I came across a huge lake within a mile and it immediately reminded me of my 1st trip here 9 years ago.  These Maine lakes are incredible.  
As I headed south, I ran into some NOBO thru's.  Sparky and Ketchup at one point and McFlurry later on.  You could tell they were getting excited about finishing and I even had some fun psyching them up for their summit up Katahdin.  Their huge smiles were worth it.  
The trail followed a huge river (not sure the name) for a few miles and there were large groups of white water rafters.  It looked like a ton of fun as they took turns jumping off the big rafts and getting yanked back in.  The pace of the rafts and the pace of my hiking were the same for a while so I got to see their fun for quite a bit.  
I made it to Abol Bridge Campground around 12:30 and got my coffee. Along with an order of poutine and a Rueben.  I was so full after that, I went and took a nap right on the patio in the shade.  It was only 3.6 miles to the shelter and it was 1:30.  No reason to get there too early and I really don't want to push the miles this soon into getting back on the trail.  I ended up taking an hourlong nap when Plant and Cloudview showed up. They were getting their dog back today.  No dogs allowed in Baxter so they had to board him.  They packed up and left for the shelter but I figured I'd stay and order dinner there as well.  Sherlock and Darwin came in around 4:30 so I hung out with them and had more coffee.  They're an awesome couple and they started the trail on March 7th!  They're getting a ton of adventure on their trip.  I've heard it said that the winner is the one who stays on the trail the longest,  not the quickest to finish. It turns out I met them back in Harper's Ferry the day I left. We had breakfast together at the Town Inn hostel there.  They're staying at the campground tonight so I may not see them again unless they decide to pick up their pace (which isn't likely).  
It was 5:30 and time for me to start moving again.  As I crossed Abol Bridge, I got an awesome view of Katahdin and what I think was a bald eagle flying over the pond.  I could see the path I took to the top and it's just an amazing sight.  
I entered the Hundred Mile Wilderness and signed my registration card.  It's official now, no escaping this without doing the hundred miles.  The trail was still rooty and rocky but I made it to the shelter by 6:45.  Got my tent set up and ate my BLT.  I'm going to try and recalibrate my time here and get to sleep early so I can get an earlier start tomorrow.  Just as the sun comes up earlier here, it goes down a little earlier too.","Katahdin Stream Campground a

I set the alarm for 5:30 but shut it down quick.  The body wasn't ready to get up and there's no arguing with the body.  Finally got up around 7 and on the trail by 7:30.  The new tent set up breaks down pretty quick in the morning.  There was a tent behind mine that wasn't there when I went to sleep last night.  I had passed Pokey twice yesterday and she must have come in late.  She was friendly enough and had brought a new shelter register and pens.  There were 3 full ones from the past 2 years still in the shelter.  I had a little climb first thing this morning, it brought me up to Rainbow Ledges where the trail was lined with blueberries.  There were awesome views of Katahdin and Rainbow Lake and while I was up there, I saw the Katahdin Air plane go by a couple of times. That was the plane I took on my very first backpacking trip with my buddy Wallace almost 9 years ago!!
The trail then brought me down to Rainbow Lake.  These mountain lakes are incredible.  I usually stand there for about 5 minutes in the silence and hope for a moose to come walking up to the edge.  There was also an awesome campsite right next to the lake that made me wish I pushed on another 2 miles last night.  I'll have to look for a lakeside campsite while I'm still here in the hundred mile wilderness. The view of the stars is so much better over a lake.  
Had 11.5 miles in by lunchtime and I stopped at Rainbow Stream Shelter and ate with a pack of NOBOs who were ready to be done with their adventure.  I thought the adrenaline might have them pumped up but they all said that their bodies were giving up on them.  They were all almost out of food too which doesn't help. I know that feeling when your body needs calories- it's so draining. 
Earlier in the day I had met a SOBO named Andy ( he was so new that he didn't even have a trail name yet).  He was having knee problems and foot blister problems and to top it off, he was carrying a 60lb pack!  He's from VA and has never hiked before.  I hope he makes it out of here ok- this place is no joke.  
I took another hour long nap after lunch since I only had another 8.6 to go.  I do love my afternoon nap. 
After my nap I went around Crescent Pond (with some nice campsites on the north end) and up Nesuntabunt Mountain.  There was another nice view of Katahdin- it never gets old, just a little bit smaller each time.  
Tonight I've found my beach campsite right on Nahmakanta Lake!! A nice flat site in the trees just off the beach. I have a view of the lake and the fire which I made as soon as I got here to get rid of the bugs.  I should have a view of the sunrise right from my tent so I'll set the alarm (even if I'm not getting up for good). The skies are clear also so there is a good chance I'll see some amazing skies tonight.  Nights like this are exactly why I do this. You can't drive out to this place, the only way is to walk in- and it was well worth it.","Hurd Brook Lean-to

Namahkanta West Beach to Cooper Brook Falls Shelter 
I slept awesome on a cool night right next to the lake.  The alarm went off and I promptly turned it off choosing to sleep in this morning.  Got on the trail by 7:45.  The morning hiking is awesome when there's no pressure to do miles.  Met a bunch of NOBOs finishing up their journeys including Grease Spot, Grizzly (LASH'r),Keller, Ricola, frog and Maise
It got hot today - I was really hoping to avoid this heat but it's still not as bad as Harper's Ferry.  I was really looking forward to getting to the Antlers Campground today. It was without a doubt my favorite campsite on my 1st trip here 9 years ago.  There were a group of about 12 Girl Scouts here on a 22 day trip of the HMW.  Tough young girls with their scout leaders.  
A light rain began at 4:30 but it wasn't even really making it through the trees so I didn't get too wet.  I made it to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to at 6:00. Luckily the rain stopped and I set up my tent and kept everything dry. I was also looking forward to this place as I stayed here also on my 1st trip.  It's a shelter that sits right by a pond with a series of cascades that flow down to it.  I met Hollywood here.  He's doing a section from NH to Katahdin but he's flip flopping at several points.  He does this trip every year.  Later on Plant and Cloudview came in. Plant had a terrible wasp sting on her wrist that was making her hand and arm swell up pretty bad.  She wasn't sure how allergic she was to them but what can you do in the middle of the Hundred Mile Wilderness?? I was definitely a little concerned.  
Made my dinner and was out cold by 8:00.
The sound of the stream makes a great background noise for the night.","Namahkanta West Beach

Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to to Carl Newhall Lean-to 
Up at 5:30 on the trail at 6:15.  I was pretty excited to start getting into the elevation again.  Flat trail is nice but high views are the real payoff.  The big climb today was up White Cap Mt. It's the highest peak in the HMW at 3644'.  Not very high overall but it's a 2400' climb over 4 miles.  After White Cap, there is a mini roller coaster of 3 more peaks.  Before the climb up to White Cap, I picked up my food resupply in a bear bucket hidden in the woods.  I have a sort of treasure map that the AT Lodge gave me to find the food that I put in my bucket 4 days ago.  That should make my pack nice and heavy for the big climbs I have coming .  Half way up the climb I stopped for lunch at Logan Brook Lean-to and Hollywood was there as well. He's doing a section from NH to Katahdin that he likes to do every year.  I also hit a milestone on the way up although there was no marking for a flip-flopper like me- I hit the halfway point in miles (1095)!!! It's taken me a long time to get to the halfway point but I'm doing all of the hardest miles first so the last 500 or so will fly by.  I'm on pace to finish the whole trail in 5 months which is average.  I really thought I'd be faster but the zero days do add up.  Add in the travel days required for the flip flop and that slowed me down as well
I made it to the top of White Cap around 1:30 on a perfectly clear day!! The temps were nice at this elevation as well.  Up here I met Medicine man and Deacon(has journal). A couple of older men from GA and OH respectively.  They're a couple of NOBOs so this is basically their last big climb other than Katahdin.  They were having a blast at the top and were enjoying the remainder of their adventure whereas a lot of NOBOs I've met are ready for it to be over.  I took the side trail to the view of Katahdin- may be the last one I get.  
Made it to Shelter around 4:30 and found a nice flat tentsite with some grass.  
As I was setting up, I realized I lost a tent stake.  As I was getting all bummed out I looked down and there was a large tent stake right there on the ground!! The trail will provide!!
Making dinner, going to sleep early tonight- I like the early starts.

I slept so good last night!! I was asleep in my tent before 7:00pm!  Up at 5:30, on trail by 6.  It was a very cool morning and I had to put on my thermal layer before I got started. I do like these cool mornings. The bugs are gone and it's just a nicer hike in the cool weather.  The trail is going to keep getting tougher from this point on.  I'm entering the Barren/Chairback range which is very rocky and has a lot of short steep climbs and descents.  
After about 20 minutes I was warmed up enough to lose the fleece and thermal layer and the sun and bugs were coming out.  I had my 1st water crossing at West Branch Pleasant River.  I had to take off my boots and put on my water/camp shoes.  I hate how much it slows me down but it has to be done so I filled up with water while my pack was off as well. As I started to get my rhythm back, I came to a road crossing where I met Plodalong and Grandma Shortie - they had the best trail magic I've ever seen!! A table set up with food and resupply, a cooler with soda and Gatorade, and even a phone charger!! They said how they just wanted to help the hikers and that some outfits were profiteering so much off of the hikers that need resupply in the HMW (the cost of a resupply is $35 for someone to drop off your food in a hidden location in the woods-For example, when I set up my resupply, so did 5 other guys so that's 6x$35 for a single trip to drop off food- either do that or carry 8 days of food). Plodalong had recently retired and they plan to thruhike next year- they should have a ton of trail karma built up by then.  It was a pleasure meeting the and chatting for a while. I had a beef jerky and a Mountain Dew and that was it.  I didn't want to make my pack any heavier than it already was.  After that I had a long, steep climb up Chairback Mt.  
I got to Chairback Gap Lean-to around noon and was ready for a break and some lunch.  The heat had come in for the day and water was scarce but I had enough to get me through lunch. I had a couple tortilla sandwiches and took a nice long nap in the shelter.  
There have been a lot of groups out in the HMW including Girl Scouts and a group of Canadians.  They share theses huge loads of gear and are out here for 15-20 days.  Incredible.  
As I was hiking along, I metTip Toe who gave me a good water report for up the trail and filled me in on Monson.  Apparently some organization with deep pockets is buying up a lot of land and going to make the town into an artist destination.  I wasn't sure which shelter I was going to be stopping at but I heard that the further one doesn't have water.  I can always carry extra water, that doesn't bother me.  By 6:00 I was pretty wiped out so I decided to go to the Cloud Pond Lean-to, the only downside is that it is .4 miles off trail.  When I got there, it paid off with the view.  Set right on a huge pond, I set up my tent on the last flat site there. 
Made my dinner and did my camp chores and off to bed by 8:00.  
Plan for 16 tomorrow then a short 3 into Monson for Friday unless I get the itch to go all the way into town.","Carl Newhall Lean-to

Cloud Pond Lean-to to Leeman Brook Lean-to 
Slept good last night except for the brief spell of drizzle in the middle of the night. I was a little worried we'd have a cold morning and a cold rain is never fun.  Luckily the rain was done by the time I got up for the morning and it wasn't all that wet on the ground either.
I was excited to get started today because 1st up was the Barren Mt.fire tower.  I had climbed this on my 1st trip here 9 years ago. The top platform has fallen off but the stand and ladder are still there.  I was especially lucky this morning as the mountain top was above the clouds and there's a 360 degree view.  A sea of clouds all the way around! I climbed half way up the tower.   My knees got a little shaky as the rungs of the ladder were rusty and flexing under my weight. Some of them even spun as I grabbed them.  
The views were just incredible and I took a ton of pictures.  I also had cell reception for the 1st time in a while so I was able to call Lisa and say hello.  I spent a while up there on the mountain and the sun was bright and making things warm so I was kind of looking forward to walking down into the cloud cover if only to cool off but the clouds were burning off as I got lower.   By the time I reached the valley, the clouds were gone and the temps were beginning to rise.  The original plan was to walk about 17 miles and stop 3 miles short of the parking area at route 15 where I'd get a ride into Monson but I caught a case of the ""burger fever"" and started plotting on how I could get into town tonight.  At the crossing of Little Wilson Stream I got the idea to eat my lunch a bit early - it was 10:00 but I could eat. This would give me the ability to walk through till about 4-5:00 and see if town was still possible.  As I was sitting at the stream eating my brunch and soaking my feet, I recognized the landing on the side of the stream- I had camped right here on my 1st trip.  It brought back more memories of that incredible adventure.  
The temp was starting to rise, the humidity was coming back, and with the tough trail conditions in this section, the miles were coming very slowly.  This particular section of the HMW is more demanding than the others. A lot of steep ups and downs combined with the roots, rocks, and mud make it slow going.  I also stopped to talk a lot to the NOBOs today.  Sometimes I can't keep my mouth shut and I'll end up talking with them for 10-15 at a time- tough to make miles that way.  It does help to get info about the trail you're going to be coming across though or to let someone  know that they better carry extra water because the streams are dry ahead.  
By the time I came up to Big Wilson Stream, I was a sweaty mess and it was time for a stream bath.  1st I had to put on my water shoes and get my pack to the other side.  I found a nice sunny spot in the stream and just sat down in it. The water was clear and cool and rushing pretty quick.  Just as I felt cooled down, the black clouds rolled in and it began to thunder.   No rain, just a lot of noise.  I still had 3 miles to the shelter or 6 miles to town.  Town was still a possibility!  
I had a series of tough ups and downs, and combined with the heat, town just wasn't gonna happen today.  I relented with about 1 mile left to the shelter and accepted 1 more night without a burger.  
Just as I rolled up to the shelter the rain started and my decision turned out to be the right one.  Hollywood was here ahead of me again.  We seem to be on the same schedule.  He told me that he had called ahead to Shaws and found out that they are totally booked anyway so I wouldn't have had a room if I pushed into town.  I checked my phone and found that I had service so I called Shaw's and made a reservation for tomorrow night.  I asked them when their first shuttle is and they told me that they drop off their 1st batch of hikers at around 8:15 so I let them know I'd be there early.  It was well past time for a real shower and some good town food. I was also able to make my phone battery last a full 7 days with my battery pack so I could watch some House of Cards tonight!! Everything is going to be alright!!","

Slept terrible for the 1st time in a long time, it was my own fault though.  The bugs bit me all night long in the shelter.  I really don't know how people manage to sleep in these every night.  I was on the trail by 6:00 and motivated to get to Monson ASAP.  Shaws Hostel had said they do their 1st pick up around 8:30 so I was going to be there extra early.  
I did the 3 miles in 75 minutes and sat there for the shuttle.  I felt better just knowing I was going to be in town soon.  Also there was a cooler full of sodas at the trail head.  Hollywood came rolling up followed by Mosey and the 3 of us were so happy to be done the most remote section of the entire AT.  Poet from Shaws picked us up and gave us the tour of the hostel. It's a big old house with 2 sheds that have been converted to bunkhouses.  I got a bed in the main house.  I was showered and in town filling up within an hour.  Life is so good in town!!
We walked downtown about a half mile to Pete's Place where I had a huge breakfast of eggs, sausage,potatoes, biscuits, and a gallon of coffee!  Everything was so good! I stopped back at the hostel and met some of the other hikers here- the place is packed!  There were about 40 hikers here going in all different directions.  Some NOBOs, Some SOBOs, people just doing the HMW.  It's pure chaos.  The commotion was too much for me so I headed back into town for another bite.  I met up with Hollywood at the Shorehouse Pub & Hostel.  We had a table out back on the lake and ate some more and of course I had more coffee.  I came back to the hostel for a nap- this is what town days are for.  Eat, rest, repeat.  Woke up and headed to the BBQ place with Brew. He's out section hiking the HMW + 30 miles south.  It turns out his wife is Jennifer Pharr Davis. She holds or once held the speed record for a female thruhike of the AT. She is a trail legend and I've heard her name mentioned more than a few times on my hike.  After dinner it was time to go to the pub. On the way, I ran into Plant and Cloudview!!! Hadn't seen them since Plants arm was about to explode from a wasp sting.  Her arm was looking much better and it was great to catch up with them about the rest of the Wilderness.  They're taking a double zero here in town and I can't blame them.  The HMW is tough and the time off is much deserved.  I've decided to zero here tomorrow as well.  We sat out back by the lake with about 20 other hikers.  There are some characters out here.  I had just enough room left for a brownie sundae.  Back at the hostel had time to watch a few episodes of House of Cards and pass out.","Leeman Brook Lean-to

I felt a 0 day was justified after the long stretch in the HMW so I biked the bunk for another night.  I enjoyed breakfast at Pete's Place so much yesterday that I decided to go there again today.  Today was about resting and loading up on calories and that's what I did.  After my breakfast nap I headed back to Petes to have coffee on the back deck overlooking the lake.  As I was getting up to get a refill on my coffee, the owner Colleen asked if my feet were ok.  I said my feet were fine but I just have a bit of the hiker hobble (my legs tighten up immediately when I sit down and it takes a few steps to loosen up again).  She offered a foot soak with Epsom salts and marbles and I said of course I could use that.  So I sat on the deck, overlooking the lake, drinking my coffee, and enjoying the wifi on my phone.  It was total happiness for a good 20 minutes.  
Off to lunch at the gas station up the road- the gas station has a mini mart with an awesome grill and cheap burgers so I had a few with some fries and grabbed some resupply while I was there as well.  I took my burgers to go and sat in the park by the lake on another perfect weather day.  Time for lunch nap.  When I got back to the hostel, I saw Kate who I had t seen since Franklin NC about 2+ months ago!! It was so early in the trip she didn't even have a trail name yet.  She's Lost & Found now.  She flipped up to Maine at Harper's Ferry as well and said she saw my name in the registers and was trying to catch up.  She's with Tunnel Rat and Chimney- I recognized their names from the registers down south but hadn't met them till now.  
We all headed to the Lakeshore Pub for dinner.  The pub is tiny and was packed with a mix of locals and hikers.  It's so small, it's like you're all hanging out together.  Just as we were finishing up it started to pour and the radar said severe stuff was heading out way so we ran the quarter mile back to the hostel. I rushed off to be so quick that I forgot to sign up for the Shaw's breakfast in the morning.

Shaw's Monson to Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to
Ran to Pete's this morning for one last town breakfast and it was a little sad to be leaving town today but it was a perfect weather day and the miles don't walk themselves. Another bonus is that the trail is fairly easy for the next 20 or so miles.  Early in the morning I ran into Feathers, Tootsie, Mountain Mama, and Web Buster- I had met the 3 ladies the last night in the HMW and now they had picked up 1 more. Saw a lot of NOBOs today including 2 that  flew by and their smell hit me like a wall before they even reached me.  
I was surprised a few miles in by a water crossing.  I had to to swap the boots for water shoes and walk through.  I thought I was done with these in the HMW but here it is.  As I was swapping shoes I met Sarah and her boyfriend who were out for a day hike.  She was excited to meet a couple thru-hikers (there was a NOBO crossing also) and gave us both a few packs of M&Ms.  Food is always accepted and appreciated!!
The trail followed the river for about 5 miles and was fairly level so it made for quick miles.  Another river crossing with water shoes, I'm glad I kept them.  I was thinking of trading them in for a lighter pair. 
Came to a road crossing where I met up with Little Knife and Karma. They had gotten back on the trail yesterday but weren't feeling the trail anymore so they decided to get off trail, rent a car, and explore more of Maine- they were going back to Shaws for 1 more night though. 
Got to shelter @ 6 and met Oh Man, Portugal, Michael, and another gentleman- all northbound.  
They had questions about the procedure to get to Katahdin so I walked them through the procedure.  It's a little too complicated if you ask me.  Baxter Park makes it so difficult.  It goes like this:
You pass Abol Bridge Campground and walk a mile to a sign in sheet.  If the sign in sheet is full (12 slots), you have to turn around and walk a mile back to the campground.  If there's a slot, you sign up and walk 10 miles to the campsite you just signed up for.  Next morning, you walk to the ranger station  and sign in.  The tricky part is having a place lined up for after you summit- Baxter only wants you in the park for the day. The campsites  at Baxter are booked months in advance.  They'll do what they can to find you a spot with someone else but they could really use some stealth sites.  
Anyway, it was nice meeting the NOBOs and I have an awesome tentsite for the night.  I'm going to try to get an earlier start tomorrow to see if I can get more miles in.","Monson

Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to to Caratunk
The loons were active overnight last night.  By active, I mean noisy.  I think a couple of them were arguing or something.  I woke up this morning around 6:00 to the coolest morning yet.  Some NOBOs I met later said it went down into the 40's overnight.  The options for today are 13 or 18 miles.  13 gets me close to Caratunk where I need to resupply and 18 gets me into Caratunk, but a little later than I normally like to get into town.  I like to get my money's worth when I stay at a hostel as opposed to rolling in late and paying just to get a shower and go to bed. If I can get there before 4 or 5, I think I'll do it.  
1st climb today was up Moxie Bald Mountain.  On my way up I met Rick Tick and Lem Sip, a British couple talking about the Relax Inn in Atkins.  As soon as they said that I chimed in that it was the most disgusting place I'd ever stayed in my entire life!!  They agreed and we laughed about just how everything in the place was dirty or broken or smelly. We ended up chatting for about 10 minutes.
On the way up to Middle Mountain I met up with Dan (now Destiny) who I'd met on the bus to Medway a week or so ago.  He was in a group of 3 but his buddies were going a little too slow for him.  
I also ran into Feathers, Tootsie, Web Buster, and Mountain Mama ( along with her husband Buckeye) for the 3rd day in a row.  Every time I see them, their group has 1 more!!
Pushed the remaining 15 miles into Caratunk by 4:15.  We walked down the dead end street that the B&B was on and noticed that half the houses were abandoned.  It was a little depressing.  We eventually came up to a nice looking, well kept House and went in to register.  There we met Paul (One Braid) the owner/operator of the hostel.  He was very easy going, didn't even make us take our boots off which is SOP at every other place.  I took mine off anyway just out of habit.  He showed us around and let us know that he can run a shuttle in to town anytime we'd like.  Showered up and ready for dinner, we got a shuttle to Northern Outfitters Brewery and Restaurant.  The food was ok at best and a little overpriced but the choices are very slim in these parts.  Back at the hostel by 7:30 and asleep by 9:00.  It was a long day- full miles and a town stop.
Side note to Karl- it turns out I never saw 1st Sgt but I did see his name in a register in Monson. Karl and I were both reading his journal back in march/April before I decided to hike.  I was hoping to get a picture with him and to let him know that Karl and I were reading along but it never happened.

Caratunk House B&B to West Carry Pond Lean-to
Slept pretty good in a springy bed and got up at 7:00 for an awesome breakfast.  All the NOBOs I had passed yesterday raved about the food here. Apparently Paul is a chef and cooks up meals for his guests.  Coffee, French Toast, eggs with sautéed veggies, bacon, potatoes.  All you can eat!  
It was tough to leave after that!  Paul also has a food resupply store in the house.  All the things a hiker could want. I needed 3 days of food to go with the one left over to get me to Rangley about 76 miles away. Now that my belly and my pack were full, I had to get out of here soon or I would be staying another day!  Got out around 9:30 and made my way to the Kennebec ferry about a half mile away. Waited my turn to go across and was moving good at 10:30.  Moving so good that I totally wiped out on a slippery rock. Took my 2nd spill of the trip and landed on my side.  Jumped up to look around and make sure nobody saw- no injuries, it's all good.  The rain overnight has made everything slick, mainly the exposed roots and rocks which means the entire trail here in Maine.  I was forced to take it a little slower than I'd like and still almost fell a few more times.  That's when I came up to a 25' log crossing.  It was comical.  The log wasn't even flattened out on top. I gave it a quick test with my boot to see how slippery it was, it may as well have been covered in oil.  I did manage to make it across, very slowly.  The clouds were starting to give way when I passed by a nice waterfall.  It was about 11:30 and I was ready for a break and some lunch.  Destiny passed by and took a break as well.  This kid is fast.  He was probably 2 or 3 canoe trips behind me and still caught up in a little over an hour. Looking over the map at lunch, our options are a 14 mile day to the one shelter or a 19 mile day to get to some campsite.  I'm thinking with the late start, we're only getting 14 in today.  The sun was coming out more and more when I passed Pierce Pond @ 12:18(pics). This is the site where a hiker drowned about 5-6 years ago. I was reading the journal of a guy named Achilles (awesome journal btw) when he stopped updating for a bit.  When he finally updated, he told the story of how his buddy jumped in for a swim and cramped up or something. It was tragic. I was a beautiful setting but I could only think of that poor kid.  
The trail leveled off for a bit as I came to 
East Carry Pond @ 2:25 (pics).  There's a nice little beach at one point and I decided to soak my feet for a bit.  I met 3 NOBOs who were taking a break as well.  They said the trail behind them was tough and that they deserved a break like this.  They came from the Bigelows which is where I'll be heading tomorrow.  It is some serious elevation.  I'll have specific numbers in tomorrow's entry but I'm definitely a little anxious. After the Bigelows and Saddleback, I'll be heading into the Whites.  Probably the toughest section of the entire AT.  
After the beach break it was decided that we'll only do the 14 which put us at the shelter @ 5:00.  The place was empty except for one other guy. He asked my name and said ""I thought that was you!"" It turns out that it's Loon Seeker!! I met him back at the Priest Mountain Shelter back in VA around the 4th of July!! He's hopping around completing sections of the trail that he needs to have the whole thing done. He lives up this way and is heading south towards NY.  Just as we're sitting there, you could here the loons calling back and forth.  It was nice to catch up with him while we ate our dinner.  It's a small trail.  Forgot to mention that I took another spill today (for a total of 3 during the whole trip). Hopefully they come in 3's and I'm done. I took a fall off of the bog boards that run over some swampy sections of trail.  Luckily it was a grassy section and not that black smelly muck or it could've been a real disaster.  The boards were wet and moldy and my foot slipped right off and I went down shoulder 1st.  Any one of these falls could end my trip if there's a rock or I get impaled by a stick.  I went the entire 1st half without an out of control fall and now I've had 3 this week.  Hopefully that'll be the last!","Caratunk

Up at 5:00 and on the trail by 5:45.  I have a lot of elevation to climb today so I thought an early start was a good idea.  I passed my 1st set of NOBOs by 6:30 and there's always a quick high 5 to celebrate no more spider webs. The 1 bad thing about being 1st on the trail is all the spider webs right across your face.  As soon as you wipe one away, it is promptly replaced.  Soon after the celebration, I passed another NOBO-Cool breeze.  He started the trail May 22! 2 weeks after me and he didn't flip flop!! He said he was thru-hiking unsupported but all he had was a fanny pack?  Don't know where the tent or sleeping bag was?  In any case, the guy is flying!
Around 10:00 I ran into a family thru-hiking.  Lightning-he's 12, his little sister Starshine- probably around 8, Mama Pajama, and Papa Bear. I asked them how far they were going and they said ""Springer, of course!""  Go figure. They were all so clean looking to be thru-hikers.  Later on I met Bambi Magnet from Finland. He started May 17 and is another trail legend.  I heard his name a couple times- people are always talking about the really fast ones.  He even got laid up in VT with Lymes Disease.  
The easy miles were over for the day and 1st up was Little Bigelow Mountain.  I was pretty whooped from this climb and I still had a few more to go today.  There was an awesome view though. I could see Sugarloaf ski resort across the valley and both Bigelow peaks to my south.  That's where I'm heading next, but not before I descend 750' just to climb right back up and then some. 
I climbed Bigelow Avery (4088') and Bigelow West Peak (4145')- both with incredible views!! Both had 360 degree views and the sky was clear.  Both were up above tree line too so the windbreaker had to go on as soon as I pass the last tree.  As I was traversing the peaks, I passed the ATC group for the 3rd day in a row.  They're a nice group of people and we always chat for a few before going out separate ways.  
On top of West Peak someone had left an apple!! All mine now!! It was the best apple I ever had!! It was so refreshing probably more so because I was low on water and had a few more miles before I could refill. 
Came to the campsite around 4:00 which was pretty good time. I was worn out though.  I had thought about going another 3 to a tentsite in the valley but they feet were not gonna have it.  Destiny  rolled in just as I was done setting up.  I think we were both a little surprised at how tough the conditions were today. 
I ate as quick as I could and was in my tent for the night by 5:30.  I dozed off and on until 7:30 when I slept through the rest of the night.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

Up at 5:30, on the trail by 6:15
Had a lot of elevation to climb today and wanted to make the 18 miles to stay on schedule for Rangeley due to limited food.
Moving along trying to push it and train for the Whites as well.  As I was motoring up the hill, a NOBO hiker had some questions about the Caratunk B&B.  His name was Gallon because when he did the trail back in '82, he ate a gallon of ice cream as opposed to the customary half gallon at Pine Grove Furnace PA.  He said has yet to do that since.  He's hiking the entire Eastern Continental Divide Trail. He started in Key West FL on January 1st so that means he did 1900 miles before even stepping foot on the AT. He's going to continue on after Katahdin to the end (not exactly sure how many more miles that is). He was a character and we ended up talking for a good 20 minutes before we went our separate ways.  I was still a little worried about making my target for the day but meeting the people is a huge part of the experience.  
I was up and over  North Crocker and South Crocker  by noon which were my major climbs for the day.  There was no view on top of North Crocker but what can you do.  At South Crocker peak there was a nice ledge with a view so I decided to have lunch there. Just as I sat down the sun came out- it had been cloudy all morning.  The pressure was off to make the shelter as I only had a little more than 7 miles.  I still had another big climb up Sugarloaf Mountain.  1000' climb in .8 miles- one of the steepest sections I've ever done.  It was an ass kicker but I took my time, had no choice really.  Some nice views of the mountains I'll be climbing tomorrow.  Another huge day tomorrow. 
On my way down I met Matchbox and Pack Horse. A nice couple from Martinsville WV. The husband was out supporting his wife's section hike by hiking with her.  I also passed by the ATC people again for the fourth day straight.  Of course we stopped and chatted for a while again.  I actually know these people now.  It's nice what they do organizing trail maintenance and all. 
One last 500', .5 mile climb for the day and I was home free.  Got to the shelter around 4:30 and not in too bad shape either.  Set up, did some camp chores, and hung out with the crew at the shelter while I made my dinner.  I do enjoy the early starts, so I'll be asleep by 8:00 hopefully.  5:00am comes early and I still need extra sleep to let my body heal.  Reservations are made for the Farmhouse Inn for Saturday night.  Snagged the last 2 bunks for me and Destiny.
Looking forward to the views coming up tomorrow!","Horns Pond Lean-to

Spaulding Mountain Lean-to to Piazza Rock Lean-to 
Up at 5:15 on the trail by 6:00.  I couldn't tell wether it was still dark or if it was going to rain.  I've been lucky in Maine up to this point but it wasn't looking good. I heard thunder in the distance before a drop fell and morning started turning back into night as I descended into the thick pines.  Then it started very lightly.  Within 15 minutes it was pouring with thunder and lightning.  Today's climbs were up above treeline so I had a decision to make on wether or not I attempt to go over the 3 high peaks today.  There was a shelter in 6.5 miles so I had time to get there and think about it. 
Before the rain started, I met High Life and we celebrated no more cobwebs this morning. He's flip flopping as well but he started in WV and headed to Katahdin before heading back down to WV and continuing on to Springer- he said he's the 1st to ever do it that way a couple years ago and now the ATC is promoting HIS way.  I couldn't tell how serious he was.
Luckily the rain stopped by 9:00 and I had time to dry out at the shelter.  I also crossed paths with Dotcom.  She's a volunteer at the ATC in Harper's Ferry and she was near certain that she remembered me and I'm pretty sure she took my halfway  photo.  She was out with her husband and another couple just doing some trail research.  She was telling me how they celebrate the end of the trail for flipfloppers like me.  I have to be sure and finish on a Tuesday so I can get the Dotcom celebration!
The clouds had cleared away by the time I got up to Saddleback Junior.  The view was incredible! 360 degrees so I could see where I'd been the past few days and I could see where I was going next.  I pushed on to The Horn where I had lunch.  Again, incredible views.  As I sat there eating my lunch, I noticed the clouds forming again over Saddleback but it was nice and sunny where I was and I think my clothes even dried out.  On to the last climb of the day, Saddleback.  As I was in the gap between the two peaks, the clouds came in fast so there wasn't much of a view at the top.  I was glad to have the climbs out of the way and now only about 5 miles to the shelter, or 7 into town.  With about 2 miles to the shelter, the skies opened up again and I was soaked instantly.  The shelter it is tonight.  I'll give it one more try.  I think getting eaten by the bugs is better than setting up a tent in the mud and rain (and having to pack it up in the mud and rain as well).
There was another group of young girls here out on a 10 day trip- it still amazes me how rugged these little girls are. They're from Maine but were all speaking French.  They're not staying in the shelter, they set up these huge tents in the rain while the counselors make the dinner. There was also a father with 2 sons heading north to Katahdin to finish their thru-hike.  Squire, Stretch (15), and Remix (13).  They're from the US but have been living in Belgium for a few years now so the kids speak fluent French as well.  
Out of my wet stuff and into my dry thermal layers and I still have a little battery left on my phone to watch some of a movie.","

Piazza Rock Lean-to to Rangeley (Farmhouse Inn)
Slept very well in the shelter for a change and I got to sleep in a bit also.  We were meeting the Farmhouse Inn shuttle at the road crossing at 8:30 as they drop off the hikers who stayed the previous night.  I had my stuff packed up and was on the trail by 7 anyway and at the trailhead by 7:45.  On the way I met J2 from OH and we gave each other some intel on the hostels we'd be passing on our respective trips.  The shuttle arrived in time and it was a 15 minute drive to the hostel.  We got the tour and procedures and had about 30 minutes till the next shuttle to town.  This place is nice! Bunk room upstairs, lounging area with TV and recliners, and a full kitchen if you'd rather buy food at the supermarket and cook here.  They also run 5 shuttles to the center of town (about 1 mile) everyday. Destiny, Aiden, and myself jumped on the 1st one to get some town breakfast.  The town of Rangeley is basically 1 long street and they were having a parade today so it was extra busy. We headed to the breakfast place - I've noticed that all these small towns have a ""breakfast only"" place that closes around noon.  We got the usual- the biggest plate on the menu.  3 of everything with OJ and coffee.  We had gotten loaner clothes from the hostel so we stuck out from the crowd a bit and the locals were all very nice to us.  We also met a couple, Jim and Barbara from Atlanta who wished us well on our journey and when I went to pay for my meal, the cashier informed me that Jim had just paid our bill!! I went over to thank him and he explained how they do trail magic down in Woody Gap GA as well.  It amazes me how many kind people there are out there and Thanks again Jim and Barbara!!  I came back to the hostel on the 11:00 and got a shower and my dirty laundry all rounded up and headed to the laundromat on the 1:30 shuttle.  Got the laundry started and went to the town pub for lunch and more coffee.  I was also able to update my journal with the wifi also.  With my town chores all done I headed back to the hostel for the night and stayed off my feet as much as possible.  The original plan was to take a zero here but since we got in so early, we're just gonna get back on the trail in the morning.  Only about 5 more days to the Whites of New Hampshire!! I took a look at the elevation profiles and must say I'm a little nervous.  2,3, and 4000' climbs will be everyday.  For now I'll just enjoy the rest of Maine.","Piazza Rock Lean-to

Rangeley to Bemis Mountain Lean-to
Slept pretty well last night in the bunk room- you never know how many snorers there will be and last night there was only one.  I signed up for the 8:30 shuttle back to the trailhead so I got to sleep in as well.  Had a couple cups of coffee before I headed to the trail and was hiking by 8:45. Nice cool sunny morning but the clouds came in quick and we got our 1st shower of the day- a quick soaker.  The sun came out immediately after and warmed things right back up.  After that I met Pineapple- he was going NOBO and was just a positive type of person.  We ended up chatting for a few and I noticed he had a fishing rod. He said there was a canoe in the pond about 4 miles up the trail that is unchained and free to use.  He said he caught a nice trout but threw it back because he wasn't going to clean it.  By the time I got to the pond, the 2nd shower was passing through. This one lasted a while longer but ended around noon. Soaked again but there's hope that I will dry out by the time I camp tonight. Had lunch at Sabbath Pond Lean-to and met Summer Breeze, Jager, and Queen Vidalia.  They were heading North and had some good info for us about the Whites.
Climbed Bemis Mt 2nd Peak - these views are incredible. There are open ledges that you walk along for a half mile or so. I got a whiff of fire as I was approaching the shelter and was happy to see that someone had a nice fire and plenty of wood piles up. I arrived around 6:30 which was a little later than I've been doing lately.  At the shelter I met Fallen- he 0'd at the shelter because he's had some knee problems. Not sure how much farther he's going to make it- he seemed pretty down mentally and physically.  I gave him a nice pep talk and gave him some ideas on how to deal with the knee pain for the short term.  His knee pain sounded like mine from the beginning of the trail. Who knows- if you're not having a good time, maybe it's time to take a break. Ate dinner and off to bed immediately after a long, late day.","Rangeley (Farmhouse Inn)

Bemis Mt Lean-to to Surplus Pond Rd CampsiteDid not want to get up this morning.  I feel like a get to sleep in a little bit longer when I stay in a shelter - No tent to pack up.  I was still on the trail by 7.  On the list for today are 3 climbs, 2 very big ones. I'm feeling stronger lately and figure that this is the last chance I have to train for the Whites.  I hit the climbs pretty hard and felt good at the top, think I'm in shape.  There are so many blueberries up here, they do slow me down a bit.  I have a hard time passing them by and as soon as I have 1, I keep stopping for more. Oh well, there's no rush.  Today was sunny and cool, the best hiking weather!  Passed a lot of NOBOs today.  
Today was mostly uneventful, just another incredible day in Maine.  Endless views, pictures just can't do it any justice.","Bemis Mt Lean-to

Surplus Pond Tentsite to Speck Pond Shelter
Up Baldpate this morning.  Steep but the views were worth it.  I felt completely weak today - totally opposite from yesterday.  I still can't figure out how this works.  I think a lot of it is mental, my body is in the best shape it's ever going to be.  I do feel worn down sometimes, but I'm still performing on a whole different level.  Passed a lot of NOBOs again today, they must be quite a big bubble.  Around 2:00 headed down into Grafton Notch where YOLO and Shiela were handing out some trail magic in the parking area!! Soda, cookies, and apples! They even had some chairs to sit in, what a luxury!  I sat on the ground because I didn't want to get their chairs all dirty but they insisted so I enjoyed being civilized for a bit.  There were quite a few hikers rolling up as I enjoyed my Dr. Pepper but the thunder in the distance got me motivated to move on.  Thanks YOLO and Shiela!!!  Had a huge climb out of the gap and I could see the dark clouds moving in.  I was a little worried to hear the thunder as I was heading up to the top but I wasn't turning around.  Just keep moving fast! I could see the rain in the distance but it never reached me, thank god!   Got to Speck Pond Shelter around 5:30 and was pretty beat from the big climb.  The weather was still looking a little dicey so I decided to stay here instead of pushing on.  This is a maintained campsite which means they have a caretaker and charge $5 to stay here. One of the other campers here said that Destiny had stopped in but decided to keep moving.  We were trying to get down the Mahoosuc arm before the rain but I didn't have the energy to keep going.   They just built a nice new shelter and this is the 1st season it's in use - it still has that fresh cut wood smell.  Just as I got back with my water, it started raining so it was nice to be in a shelter tonight.  No wet tent to pack up in the morning! I wonder if Destiny made it to the bottom of the arm?  We have reservations at The Barn Hostel in Gorham for Friday night so I'm sure I'll see him there.   Chilly night and the rain pattered on the metal roof all night.","Surplus Pond Rd Campsite

Speck Pond Shelter to Gentian Pond Shelter
Slept very well last night and was a little disappointed to see everything outside was still wet.  I was a little worried about the conditions going down the Mahoosuc Arm.  It's about an 1800' descent in a little over a mile down a steep slab of rock and the wet conditions did not help.  I can honestly say I was a little worried.  Who knows how long I would slide if I lost my footing.  There were a couple close calls where I slid and lost my balance.  It's funny how the one leg goes flying up in the air but somehow I managed to stay on my feet.  I couldn't imagine doing this in the rain.  Also, on trail this steep, I would have preferred going up instead of down.  Made it to the bottom and didn't see the tentsite that's listed on my app.  Thought I might pass Destiny if he stayed there but no sign of him.
  Up next is the Mahoosuc Notch - ""the hardest mile"" on the AT.  I didn't realize I was in it until I climbed over a few boulders - I thought it would have been marked or something.  The boulders were still wet from the rain yesterday and the fact that not much sun gets in here.  Some people laugh and enjoy this stuff but after the dangerous descent down the Arm and now climbing over these huge boulders, I was pretty pissed.  It just feels like the trail organizers are trying to get you hurt.  Some of these boulders are 15-20' tall! All I could think of was how many NOBOs make it to this point only to take a spill and injure off the trail.  Going under the boulders is just a pain in the ass as you have to take your pack off and drag it over wet dirty rocks and put it back on.   I also got stuck behind a group of younger kids just taking their time and messing around on the path.  There is only 1 way to get through this as it is sheer rock walls on both sides.  I kept checking my app to see how much longer this nonsense was going to last.  I was so relieved to have made it through unhurt.  I then crossed the 1300 mile mark which was good for a quick pick-me-up!!  Came around the corner and there was the ME/NH border sign!!!  Had a snack and talked with some NOBOs who were taking pics and having a good time.  They're crossing into their last state and you can see the excitement and relief on their faces.  I was happy to have another state checked off this list too!  The trail changed quickly and it seemed like I was out of the Mahoosuc range altogether.  Hiked up to some ledges and had great views.  Also crossed some alpine bogs.  Some of the bog boards would sink right in as soon as you put some weight on them so you had to kind of run across a few of them.  Who knows how deep some of them are.  I kept wondering if there were any bodies in there.  
Got to Gentian Pond shelter and set up my gear inside.  It's a nice 2 level shelter and I had plenty of space.  The only water source was Gentian Pond so I went down to fill my water bottles.  I happened to look across the lake and there it was!! The Gentian Pond moose!! I had heard about it from NOBOs I had passed days ago but there it was!  He was slowly making his way around the edge of the pond in the water up to his shoulders at times.  I really wished I had my good camera but the phone was gonna have to do.  Snapped some pics and watched him for a while.  I let the others at the shelter know he was down there so they went to get a look.  It was getting a little cool and I had enough for one day.  So glad to finally be in NH!","Speck Pond Lean-to

Up early and on the trail by 6:45 - motivated to get to town where I had a reservation at the Barn Hostel.   I was a little worried about how I would get to the hostel though because it's about 6 miles from the trail and cell service has been terrible up here.  I could always try to hitch a ride but I hate that uncertainty.  I'll worry about that when I get there. The trail a little easier today, no huge climbs showing on the app. I was making great time and was at the trail head parking lot in no time!  Just as I came walking up, a big Lincoln pulled into the lot - it was Paul the hostel owner!!   A hiker I had passed this morning told me about his huge sled of a Lincoln and how he packs like 10 hikers at a time in it - this had to be it. Into Gorham aty 12:00 and had a bit of reservation confusion.  Dan (Destiny) had made the reservations for the 2 of us a couple days ago but when I went to check in, Paul said that Dan only made a reservation for 1!!  He also said the place was full and he had no vacancies!! I couldn't believe it.  I explained to him that my buddy had made reservation for 2 and that we were going to stay an extra day and take a 0.  He told me not to worry and that he would find a spot for me.  Destiny showed up a little later and resolved the whole issue when he explained to me that his name is actually Dylan and not Dan.  Wouldn't you know, Dylan did actually make a reservation for 2 for 2 days.  Dan, whoever the hell he is, actually had a reservation also but only for 1.  So glad to have that resolved!  Got cleaned up and did laundry and headed out to Welsh's for lunch.  Walked the main strip which was having a farmers market today.  
This hostel has one of the best set ups I've seen on the trail!! Beds with foam mattresses and clean linens (even a couple full sized beds for the couples hiking out there).  Couches and recliners with a TV, Netflix, ping pong table, big kitchen area with stove and oven and fridge.  And he runs shuttles to town and to the Pinkham Notch visitor center where some people get dropped off to do slackpacks.  It's close to the center of town with a restaurant, the post office, and an outfitter too!  We picked a good place to take a 0 at.  It's a toss up between this place and Uncle Johnnies down in TN for my favorite hostel on the entire trail.","Gentian Pond Shelter

The planned 0 turned out to be great idea. On top of letting the body heal for a day before heading into the Whites, the weather was fog and rain.  I'm glad I didn't have to head out into it.  The plan is to load up on calories and rest as much as possible.  Other town chores include getting new tips for my hiking poles- the originals have worn down to little nubs and I also need new boots.  Gorham isn't a big town but they do have an outfitter, thank god.  I also mailed some of the extra food ahead to North Woodstock instead of leaving it in the hiker box.  Breakfast at Welsh's again.  I could eat here everyday.  Burgers from Mr. Pizza for lunch and I picked up some frozen pizzas to make at the hostel and save some money on dinner.  I also did some reading on the internet about a good diet for long distance hiking.  It turns out that Snickers are the perfect hiking food.  https://thesummitregister.com/...A group of hikers left this morning to slack pack 21 miles from Pinkham Notch back to Gorham and stay at the hostel again tonight.  They came in pretty beat up (and soaking wet) after 7:30.  As much as I'd like to stay here another night, I think it would be too much even with the light pack.  I was able to lay around all day and watch movies and eat as much as possible.  It will not be easy leaving here in the morning.","Gorham (The Barn Hostel)

Gorham (The Barn Hostel) to Carter Notch Hut
Woke up early today to get breakfast at Welsh's one last time and to take care of last minute chores before the shuttle back to the trail leaves at 7:30.  Ran across the street real quick to grab a coffee when I met Warren Doyle! He's another AT legend who helps people complete thru-hikes.  He follows them from trailhead to trailhead in his van and provides various levels of support.  I think his hikers have a 100% success rate but I'd have to look it up to verify.
I'm excited to finally start the Whites today and get the hardest part of the AT behind me but I have to remember to be patient and not push the miles too much.  I've heard from a lot of NOBOs that you can get food from the huts so I'm only carrying 3 days worth of food.  I've mailed a resupply box to North Woodstock and I'm hoping to be there in about 4-5 days (76 miles away)
I was on the trail by 8:00 and the beginning was well graded and clear of roots and rocks- it was so nice.  The climb started off slow and picked up like a ramp after about a mile or 2.  Then it was straight up to Mt Moriah.  There was a little .1 mile side trail to the peak and it's on the list of 48 peaks over 4000' that I started 3 years ago so I pretty much had to go up there.  The view was awesome and I'm glad I went.   Also, I got the 1st big climb out of the way and got up into the elevation.  After Moriah, the trail went right over North Carter peak(which is also on my list).  Then it was on to Middle Carter and South Carter but I don't think they're all on the list.  It is Saturday today and there are a lot of people out on the trail, most of them Peak baggers.  
Made my second big climb of the day up to Mt Hight where I met Tork and Glampress.  They're both nurses from Mt Holly NJ, about a 30 minute drive from where I live.  They flip flopped just like I did but they flipped in Port Clinton PA so they have less miles to finish their trip. It was a real trip meeting them and they seem like a cool pair.  I'm not sure I'll meet up with them again though- they were slack packing this section north and won't be going south again till Monday and I'll be way past where they're getting back on by then.  After Mt Hight I went over Carter Dome which is another one on my list.  I'm loving getting these peaks done!!  
I was feeling good today and the miles were going by quick.  I made it to Carter Notch Hut and asked if I could do work for stay.  Leslie was the cook and said ""sure, no problem.""  She explained how it works and basically I wait for the paying guests and the staff (called croo) to eat dinner and then I get leftovers.  I'll do my 30-60 minutes of work and wait for the guests to leave the dining room where I'll get to set up my air mattress on the floor and spend the night there.  
Sat around for quite awhile waiting for our assignment. Finally, around 8:00 they let us eat- and it was awesome!  All we could eat turkey dinner with mashed potatoes, veggies, cranberry sauce, salad, and apple bread.  Our assignment was to scrub some sheet pans for about 30 minutes. And we got a place to sleep.  In bed by 9:45, good 1st day in the Whites.","Gorham (The Barn Hostel)

Up and on trail by 7:00 after sleeping 11 hours last night. That climb up Madison was a killer.  Woke up to thick fog, basically in the clouds all morning.  Had a few humps to get over before I started the climb up to Mt Washington.  The trail was a rock scramble the entire morning all the way up to Washington.  Overall, it was 6 tough miles done by 11:00.  The elevation wasn't even the toughest part of it- the rocks were much harder.  The top of Mt Washington was packed with tourists, there was even a line to get your picture at the summit sign.  I skipped the sign for now and went straight to the snack bar.  $10 for round 1 - a bowl of chili, 2 hot dogs , and a cup of coffee.  Round 2 was $16 - slice of pizza, 2 more hot dogs, Snickers, brownie, and another cup of coffee. We hung out for about 2 hours total, we were in no rush- only going to Mizpah Hut today.  As we started heading down the mountain towards Lake of the Clouds Hut, the clouds began to clear from the top of Washington and I got some pictures of the towers on top.  It also made way for some incredible views down to the Hut and of the surrounding peaks.  Incredible- all above treeline you could see the paths and the people looking like ants walking along them.
Made it to Lake of the Clouds by 2:00 and had some more coffee.  The eclipse had started and people were hanging around outside with tinted glasses watching the progress. I got some good pics with my phone as the clouds would block out enough so I was able to look at it briefly.  Pretty amazing. It was about 65-70% at its peak so it was about as dark as a cloudy day.  Today was pretty chilly also and the wind chills you right through so I needed something hot to drink.  Only had 4.5 more miles to Mizpah and was there at 4:30.  The trail after Washington was so much better than the rocks from earlier so I was able to make great time.  As soon as I got to the Hut I asked about work for stay.  They only had 2 spots which were already taken but luckily they have a tentsite right next to the Hut.  I had no problem doing the tent tonight- work for stay was a little late for me.  I can have dinner and be in bed before they even assign the jobs so I prefer the early bedtime to the free meal and roof.  Set up my tent and made my Ramen dinner and in bed right now at 7:00. The call for tomorrow is rain so I'm not looking forward to that. I hope I don't have to pack up a wet tent in the morning.","Madison Spring Hut (Valley Way Tent site)

Nauman Tentsite to Stealth Tentsite at mile 357.6
Up and on the trail by 6:45.  I was a little extra motivated to get packed up early since the call was for rain all day.   Nothing yet but it's always a bonus to pack up a dry tent. Stopped at the Hut to fill my water bottles and they had coffee there!! It's gonna be a good day.  Destiny got the early jump as I sat around talking to other thru-hikers and some hut guests.  I also met Kickstand last night - he came in late and set up in the site next to mine.  He's missing his left leg just above the knee and hikes with a prosthetic.   No easy task given this terrain. He's heading south at the moment and went up Washington yesterday- incredible.  
Finished my coffee and headed out on my way to Mt Jackson. Easy climb, awesome views.  I'm going to post every pic from the Whites just because I think the scenery out here is amazing. Weather still looking good, in fact, it's better than yesterday and yesterday was supposed to be sunny and clear.  I have a clear view of the top of Mt Washington and I'm a little disappointed it wasn't like this yesterday. Over Webster Cliffs the views were awesome and it was hard to make miles with all the pictures I was taking.  I was a little bummed today that we wouldn't be passing a snack bar or visitor center of some sort- I'm getting spoiled with all the prepared food lately. And to make matters worse, I could see a campstore about 3000' below me but the trail won't be passing close to it.  
Another bonus for today is the 5 miles of smooth level trail that follows an old rail bed.  Was able to fly through that section and make it to Zealand Hut by 1:00.  Skipped lunch on the trail so I could buy some soup and bread there.  I was in luck, I got the last 2 bowls of vegetable soup and she gave me 2 huge hunks of bread to go with it.  Grabbed some extra Snickers bars too since I'm out of breakfast in my food bag.  Hung out at the Hut for a while chatting with a volunteer.  Destiny had already gotten here about 20 minutes before me and was relaxing also.  After about 90 minutes, I figured I better get going.  Destiny decided to stay and try to get work for stay.  I wasn't quitting after only 6 hours of hiking so I decided to push on- it was only 3:00.  I had about 7 miles to the next hut so I figured I'd just walk until I don't feel like it anymore.  The weather was still holding out so I pushed on about 4.5 miles and it started getting dark and windy. Found a nice stealth site right next to the trail. Set up and made dinner just as the wind picked up and the rain started.  My timing was perfect today. Not a moment wasted waiting for the rain and I got to stay dry as well.  Hopefully the storm passes by overnight and I can leave dry tomorrow.","Nauman Tentsite at Mizpah Hut

North Woodstock (The Notch Hostel) to NH Rt 25A(Mile 408.6)
Woke up with a bit of a sore throat for the 3rd day now.  Had to be packed and ready to go for the 7:30 shuttle.  I would've liked to stay for a zero just to celebrate the end of the Whites even though I still have Moosilauke (but what's one more mountain). The hostel was all booked for the night so it wasn't an option anyway.  We were all at the van ready to go and when we reached the trailhead Destiny was missing?  I rode in the front seat and didn't notice he never got in- He ran inside real quick and missed the shuttle! I said so long to the 2 others on the shuttle- Rick who was sectioning north and River who was heading south but in no hurry.  I started up Moosilauke at an easy pace in no rush - it's a 3000' climb in 3.4 miles- the last big one for a while!! The sore throat was bothering me a bit so I didn't want to push it.  It was pretty foggy this morning so I wasn't too hopeful for any views at the top and I was correct.  Foggy, windy, and cold - I even had to put on my hat and gloves for this one.  The temp was 46 in the valley before I left and I'm sure it was in the 30's with the wind chill up here.  Took a picture of the sign and kept moving.  As I was heading down, I met Stick in the Woods.  He was heading north and had a newer ZPacks bag.  He had the same tent as me and as we're talking,  here comes Destiny right past me like I wasn't moving. He got a 30 minute later start than me but had caught up pretty quick.  I told him I was slow going today and maybe we'll catch up later. The plan is to be in Hanover on Sunday.  
Besides the sore throat I hadn't had much of a breakfast either so I stopped and had a double lunch. Took some Advil and moved on with hope that I would start to feel better. The trail leveled off nicely after Moosilauke and I was starting to feel better and making the miles when I reached Jeffers Brook Shelter.  Destiny was there with a couple NOBOs and I was thinking it was a good time for a nap.  One of the NOBOs mentioned the omelette guy and I didn't think we were reaching him till tomorrow but he was only about 9 miles up the trail.  I took my nap because I was told he finishes up around 3:00 and there was no chance I was making it.  It turns out he stays till around 5:00.  By the time I found this out it was 3:40 and I was 3.5 miles away.  It was possible I could make it in time so I started cruising.  I figured the worst case scenario is that he's gone but I'd still have 3.5 miles further for the day.  As the NOBOs passed me, they'd say hurry up- he's still there!! So I'd go faster.  Eventually I saw the tent in the woods and it was surrounded by hikers!! I made it!!!The Omelette Guy is Carl and he's been setting up a tent on the trail for the past couple years and he makes omelettes for all the thru-hikers.  Ham, peppers, onions, and cheese.  As many eggs as you'd like.  The record this year is Mufassa who ate a 30 egg omelette just last week- I never met him but I heard he had to take a 0 the next day because he wasn't feeling so well. Along with the omelettes, he has drinks, coffee, and bananas.  It was the strangest thing to see right on the trail.  Thanks again Carl!! After the omelette, I had an easy 1.9 to the stealth site where I'm typing this up. 7:30 and ready for bed. The plan is for 22 tomorrow and an easy 11 into town on Sunday.","

Still not feeling well and slept about 12 hours last night.  Just want to get into town so I ca clean up and stay off my feet for a day.  Luckily it was easy terrain. In town by 3:00 where I met back up with Destiny. He had gotten into town by around 10:00 and was relaxing at the Starbucks.  The trail here goes right through the town of Hanover and it's a little bigger than the 1 street towns I was getting used to.   Passed by the Dartmouth football stadium and walked about a half mile to the center of town and into Starbucks where I met back up with Destiny.  I started charging my phone and battery backup.  There are no hostels here in town so we'll have to decide whether we're going to backtrack and set up our tents on the trail or contact someone here in town. The town of Hanover has a list of trail angels that will shuttle hikers or put them up for the night.  As we were sitting in the Starbucks, Aiden came walking in.  I had last seen him in Rangeley Maine.  He had breakfast with us in town that day before heading back out on the trail.  He was in town for the night so we thought about getting a hotel room (very expensive but much cheaper split 3 ways).  We figured we'd try to find a free place for the night before caving on the hotel room.  We called the first name on the list, Betsy. She said she was out of town but her husband was still there and could handle a few non-rowdy hikers. I called Bill and he said no problem- he had 4 there already but he could fit 3 more.  His place is right off the trail about 2.5 miles away and he gave me directions. It worked out perfect.  We stayed there with 4 other NOBOs and got a good nights sleep.  Thanks so much Bill and Betsy!!!","Trapper John Shelter

Supposed to be a zero day but we had to walk the 1.6 miles through Hanover to get to our hostel at the church in Norwich. And we crossed a state line as well!!!  As incredible as NH was, I'm very happy to be leaving.  It beat me up pretty bad and I'm ready to be moving on.  Before we headed south today we took the free bus into Hanover to refill on calories, coffee, and relaxation.  Aiden was only hanging around long enough to get breakfast and resupply at the grocery store.  It was nice to see him again but I was taking the full day to heal.  Destiny decided to zero as well.  After breakfast and resupply, we hit the Starbucks to charge everything and enjoy the wifi.  I took it easy on the coffee for a change but still ended up spending about 3 hours there looking over the maps and trying to plan the next stretch of trail.  Not too bad, 3 days into Rutland and another resupply. Hanover is a bit of a larger small town so they had a sushi place!! Loaded up in sushi and began the walk out of NH and into VT!! We had planned on staying at the church but it seemed to be empty and no one was answering the door at the house next door so we b fan calling the numbers listed in the trail angel list. About the 4th name down we finally got an answer. Her name was Jenny and after she took down some info she asked where I was at the moment.  I told her I was sitting at a picnic table outside a church in Norwich, she said great I'll let Breeze know your outside.  I wasn't sure what she meant until she explained that she was the pastor of the church and it was just a coincidence that I got a hold of her- it wasn't noted on the trail angel list. The list is just names and #'s, no addresses or locations. Breeze met us at the door and showed us around the place.  Kitchen here, shower there, bunks up here. We hung out in the kitchen with Breeze and a nice older woman named Sally who was staying there as well.  Went to the grocery store to pick up some ice cream for dessert and called it a night.  Zero day mission accomplished.","Hanover NH

VT103 to Peru Peak Shelter
Woke up early to make sure I had time for breakfast and coffee before Plans Too Much picks me up.  Plans Too Much is a shuttle driver in town who provides shuttles for extremely cheap When I went downstairs to the deli, they were still preparing breakfast so I offered to give a hand.  They were nice enough to put a cup of coffee in my hand first.  I made enough eggs for about 30 people in a huge cast iron pan.  I had just enough time to scarf down some food and coffee before I caught my ride.  I have to say, I enjoyed my stay at the Yellow Deli a lot.  I heard mixed reviews from other hikers and what I had read on journals over the years.  Some people have said that they're a cult but I didn't get that vibe at all.  They're a religious group but there was no attempt at conversion of either myself of anyone else that I saw.  They have simple enough rules for the hostel - nothing overbearing, it was much stricter in Damascus VA at The Place hostel.  
Plans Too Much was right on time and I was on the trail by 8:15.  The huge climbs are just about over for my trip so now it's just some moderate ups and downs at least until Mt. Greylock in MA.  On top of the easier terrain, it has been much cooler and feels like fall again.  There were plenty of gentle ups and downs today so the miles were passing quickly.  Had lunch at a trail intersection and just as I started walking again, I crossed paths with Cheese and Turbo Turtle!!!  They're a young couple from NC that I met in Harper's Ferry the night before my flip - it was great to see them again!!
I wanted to do some night hiking tonight so I had dinner up on Baker Peak right around sunset.  The views were incredible!  I met a few weekenders from NY up on the peak and had fun answering their questions about my thru-hike.  After dinner as I was heading down I also ran into Holy Smokes.  Met him in VA just outside of Atkins.  He was a bit depressed back then because his buddies had gotten off the trail that day and I wasn't sure if he was going to keep going or not.  It was good to see that he kept going.  The trail ran along bog boards most of the way around Griffith Lake and it was getting dark.  I was having second thoughts about the night hiking.  I had 20+ miles and the area didn't look like it had many stealth spots to set up my tent so I figured I would check out Peru Peak Shelter and decide.  As soon as I saw the shelter, I was done for the day.  Besides, it was 7:45 and I had enough for the day.  I set up in the shelter since it was supposed to rain overnight.  Out cold in no time.","VT Rt 103 at Clarendon Gorge

Up early and on trail by 7:00 in a light rain.  Luckily the trail looks like it could be a bit easier today - we'll see.  The views aren't really there in the rain so all you can do is put your head down and move along.  The 1st climb was up to Bromley Mountain which is a ski resort in the winter.  There is a warming shack at the top for the ski staff to and they leave it unlocked in the summer for the hikers.  No electricity or water but there was a trash can in there so at least I could get rid of my trash.  It was also nice to be able to eat a snack without being rained on.  I hung out inside for about 30 minutes and put my wet rain jacket back on.  I was a bit worried though because I had left my fleece layer on this morning because of the chill and now it was soaked as well.  This is the 1st time I've let this get wet - it's supposed to be part of my dry emergency layer.  Not sure what I'll do tonight if it gets cold.  Went back out into the rain and was chilly from sitting around so I tried to pick up the pace but I was going downhill so it wasn't easy getting warmed up again.  The rain was getting harder as well but there's nothing I can do about it.  It's just an inconvenience at this point and I try not to let it ruin my day.  Overall, I think I've been lucky with the amount of rain I've had to deal with.  I was supposed to pass a shelter around lunch time but it was down a .4 mile side trail.  It's so much nicer when they are right on the AT!!  As I approached the shelter, I could smell a fire - awesome!! Not only can I have a dry lunch but maybe I can warm up too!!
Spruce Peak Shelter is more like a cabin. It has a sliding barn type door and some windows and most importantly, a wood burning stove!  There's also a table and benches in the corner. There were about 6 people here and I think 5 of them had stayed here last night and couldn't bring themselves to go out in the rain this morning.  They all offered to make room when I came in soaked but I told them I'll just sit on the floor right inside the door - the place looked all nice and dry and I didn't want to track water and mud all through the place.  I sat there and had my lunch but wasn't ready to head back out just yet.  I decided to take off some layers and get close to the stove.  It was too nice.  
A guy named Just Jeff came in and I'm pretty sure I met him when I was down south, just couldn't place him.  He was a trip though.  We got talking about our experiences in the Smokies with permits and fees and all.  He dried out his gear as best he could by the stove and headed back out.  I wasn't ready to leave yet. I was starting to worry that I was going to end up staying for the night but I really wanted to make miles.  It's just so hard to leave the warm dry cabin to go back out into the rain.  After about 3 hours, I packed up and headed back out.  Still had about 8 miles to go to get to Stratton Pond Shelter.  
Terrain was easy but the trail was a stream in a lot of places.  I had a hard time finding a good water source and my app said that the pond would be it for the shelter.  I came to the pond and stood there in the rain for a few minutes contemplating if I really wanted to get water here or try my luck at the spring beyond the shelter.  I caved and filled my water from the pond (after filtering of course).  There was a caretakers tent set up right at the turnoff for the shelter.  This shelter has a $5 fee that pays for upkeep and the caretaker.  He called me over to his tent and asked if I was going to stay - I said I was pretty sure I was going to.  He handed me a stack of oatmeal raisin cookies he said he mother had just sent him in a mail drop. They were awesome and gone in 2 minutes.  His name was Varsity and he hiked the entire AT last year. He's from CA and wasn't ready to get a full time job when he was done the trail so he decided to do part time stuff for another year or so.  That's how he ended up becoming a caretaker out here.  They do weekly shifts or 10 days on 4 days off.  Something like that.  Their tent is set up on a platform, semi permanent, but he has to hike in and out with his other gear.  Other than that, they just keep the site tidy and collect the fees.  No cell service, no electricity, just a nice view of the pond and maybe a canoe to keep busy for the week.  Not sure I could do that.
Got to the shelter and it was almost full.  There were a large group of French Canadians and a few others.  There was also 1 bunk left - an upper of course.  I started getting cold as soon as I stopped hiking and had to get into my dry stuff.  Had dinner up in my bunk and was under the covers as soon as possible.  Staying warm takes a lot of energy and I used it all today.","Peru Peak Shelter

Stratton Pond Shelter to Goddard Shelter
Slept very well last night and it was tough getting up this morning.  I still dread putting on wet clothes in the morning.  I normally put my wet clothes in a ziplock bag and keep them under my quilt with me to keep them warm.  They don't dry in the bag but at least they're warm.  Another hiker had told me of another method that will actually dry them out as well so I tried it.  I forget who told me this but they said to lay the clothes out on the wood platform underneath my air pad and that my body heat along with the wood platform would dry out the clothes.  Complete failure!  Clothes were cold and still soaked.  Oh well, now I know.
The huge group of French Canadians were up early, had breakfast, and packed up pretty quickly.  I was contemplating how I was going to get my wet clothes on and still stay warm since it was a bit chilly this morning.  The final decision was to leave my emergency dry clothes on which was comfortable but I stressed a lot about getting these wet.  I don't know what the forcast is and I still have another night in the woods before I get to town.  
The sun came out early and I was laying out all my wet stuff every time I had a chance.  At lunch I had a full on yard sale with every single thing I carry unpacked and laid out (just like you would see in someone's driveway at a yard sale).  It helped a little but most things were still damp when they got packed up.
As I was walking down the trail, I came up on these 2 guys and the one says ""Quick Start!!!""  and I'm staring at him, just can't place the face.  It was Cowboy!! I met him in the Smokies the day I got back on trail after my vacation with Lisa.  There was a small difference though - he had blond hair now, maybe that's why I didn't recognize him.  It was good to see that he was still on the trail - I hadn't heard from him since Damascus.  Anyway, he's a bit behind the pack but should still have plenty of time to finish without having to flip up to Katahdin.  
Headed up to Glastonbury Mountain where there is a fire tower.  A few hikers recommended sleeping up there but I don't have any interest in doing that.  The wind was brutal up there as soon as it went above the treeline so that reinforced my decision.  The views were very nice and since it was around dinner time, the lighting was pretty good as well.  It's usually midday when I climb these things.  I spent about 30 minutes up there since Goddard Shelter was only .3 miles away.  
Got to the shelter around 6:30 and it looked almost full.  There were about 6 pads set up in a shelter that should hold 8 but they had all their gear spread out taking up all the space.  I asked if there was any room left in there and they were very polite to make room.  As I was making my dinner, I recognized a voice -  it was Hazmat who I'd met 1st in VA and seen a few times since.  He was the only other AT hiker here tonight - all the others are Long Trail hikers and most are heading north so they're all new and excited.  
There were 7 hikers and 2 dogs in the shelter for the night when Abby rolled in.  She asked if there was any room and we all agreed to tighten up a bit but she said she was fine to sleep on the floor in front of the platform.  I thought she was kidding but it's a good thing she did set up down there because there really wasn't much room on the platform.  She had done a 28 mile day and was finishing up the LT going south.

Up at 6:30,  actually much earlier because of snoring, not the 2 dogs that slept quietly next to me.  I was worried at first - it was something to see as these 2 dogs growled viciously at each other when it was time to lay down for the night.  They were just sorting out who was going to sleep closer to their mom.  Back to the morning though....
Ate the last of my food which was a package of pre-cooked bacon with some cheese sticks on a tortilla.  That just about empties my food bag other than a granola bar and a mini Snickers that will never make it to town.  On the trail by 7:00and the forecast was for showers starting around 11:00. The threat of rain doesn't bother me today knowing that I'll be clean and dry by noon.  The only question was how I would get into town which is about 6 mikes from the trail.  Other hikers rely on hitch hiking quite a bit but you can't really plan for how long that will take and I just haven't found it necessary (yet). Had a couple easy uphills but mostly downhill on town days. Was making good time when I came to a nice overlook.  Fall is really coming on fast.  So much yellow and orange mixed in with the evergreens and the quickly fading green leaves.  I'm hoping the change will continue as I head south.  I'm still hoping to be in Harper's Ferry by the 1st week of October so I think I should see some really nice colors.  
Made it to the trailhead at Rt 7 by 11:00 and tried thumbing a ride for a few minutes before I called the Catamount Motel.  It was amazing that I had any cell service- it was going in and out as I sat there.  The owner Paul said he'd come pick me up right away and he wasn't kidding.  He pulled into the trailhead parking lot in about 10 minutes with 2 other hikers that were getting back on the trail.  As we drove to his hotel, he pointed out all the places a hungry hiker might want to visit.  Got checkedin and was settled in and cleaned up by 12:00.  They'll do your laundry here also for only $4. I'm sure I got my money's worth because everything I owned was wet and smelly from the downpour on Sunday.  I asked Paul if they had Uber around here because I needed to get to Walmart to resupply.  He said there was no Uber but he'd be heading there later if I needed. Awesome!  
I went to the Friendly's which was the closest restaurant around.  The feet are pretty beat up and the extra distance into the center of town just didn't seem worth it.  Besides that - they have ice cream here!!!  Had a nice Rueben and coffee and for dessert, I had a Reese's Brownie Sundae, size large!  Incredible! I haven't seen a scale in a while now but I'm guessing I'm still around 170 so I'll just keep eating as much as I can handle at every opportunity and besides, I always feel strong heading out of town and I'm convinced that it's from all the extra calories.  Hung around for a while since they had a good wifi connection and was able to check my mail and read some headlines.
Got back from eating and headed to Walmart.  All the town chores done and it's only 2:30!! Relaxing is also a huge part of town days but it's not always possible. It's a little easier in a motel room as opposed to the hostels.  The hostels are always busy with hikers coming in and out and catching up with the people you haven't seen in a while but it cuts into relaxation time.  
I have a lot of journaling left over to do also. I'm working on it but it's not the easiest thing to do on the phone. I make a bunch of bullet points as I hike throughout the day but lots of times I'm too wiped out to write at the end of the day. I'll go back and fill in the blanks but it ends up sounding like more of a technical report than a journal.  Sorry for the gaps- I will fill them in eventually.

Catamount Hotel to Wilbur Clearing ShelterDidn't get on trail till about 9:00 this morning.  The office was closed and I needed a shuttle back to the trailhead.  Met 3 Cats, Jenny, and Lynn who just started the Long Trail yesterday heading north which means I'm getting closer to the border!!  Stopped by the Congdon Shelter which was right on the trail and saw a hiker still sleeping.  I tried to be quiet while I ate a snack and he told me he was in no hurry as he was trying to be in town tomorrow for a college game.  Around noon I passed by a large beaver pond and decided to have lunch here.  I""m not sure how many more of these I will see, it kind of reminded me of ME and NH where they were everywhere.  I crossed the border into MA around 3:45 - one more state down!!!!  The trail immediately got better with bog boards and drainage so there was much less mud.  All was going well until 4:15 and it started pouring rain.  Oh well - I was dry for most of today.  Passed by a nice spring and refilled my water bottles and just as I got back on the trail Big Time passed by!! I met him in Newfound Gap TN when Lisa came to visit.  We gave him a ride into Gatlinburg and the last I saw him was in Erwin TN.  Not sure he's going to be able to make it to Katahdin by October 15th but he said he would flip if he had to.  Crossed a couple of roads that headed into towns but I couldn't justify another night indoors, especially since I just zeroed.  I started the climb up Mt. Greylock - supposedly the last big climb for me (at least that's what my NB friends have told me).  The climb wasn't so bad with all the switchbacks but it was pretty long.  The rain had stopped as well so I even had a little bit of dry out time before I was done hiking for the day.  There is a shelter around 3/4 of the way up so I can save some of the climb for tomorrow morning.  The only problem is that it's .3 off trail.  Came to the trail junction around 7:00 and was happy to see that it was a level side trail.  Nothing worse than heading up or down on miles that don't even count.  The shelter was nice with a large camping area around it as well  - and I had it all to myself.  It was a little creepy actually.  I set up my sleeping pad in the shelter and had to make my dinner by headlamp as it got dark very quickly.  Terrible idea!  The bugs were bouncing off my head the entire time I had the light on.  I tried to work in the dark but it just wasn't possible.  I will be sure to make this the last time I ever have to do this.  Just as I finished dinner the rain started again -  so glad to be in the shelter, no wet tent for me in the morning!","Catamount Hotel, Bennington VT

Wilbur Clearing Shelter to Tom Levardi's house
The alarm went off at 6:00 and instead of hitting the snooze button, I just turned it off completely.  Slept till about 6:45 and got on trail by 7:30.  Not sure why I still do that because I really don't get good sleep after the alarm.  First up this morning is the remainder of the climb up Mt. Greylock.  It was a nice cool clear morning but the sides of the trail were wet from the rain last night so my legs and feet get soaked again on the narrow sections of trail.  There's a tower at the top of Mt. Greylock but it wasn't open yet and besides, there were awesome views from the base of the tower.  The clouds were below the top of the mountain and looked like a sea of white.  Incredible!  I didn't plan on hanging around here long but then I saw Bascom Lodge.  They had a little cafe and COFFEE!!!  I resisted the temptation to have another breakfast mainly because the prices were ridiculous but I was OK overpaying for coffee.  They had wifi here as well so that was a nice bonus.  I was also a little relieved knowing that the huge 2500'+ climbs are over for me.  
It was on to the Cheshire Post Office to pick up my resupply box that Lisa sent me.  Unfortunately I got there 5 minutes after they closed for lunch so I had an hour to kill before I could get my package.  No big problem really.  Actually it worked out better because I was able to charge my phone and battery bank in the lobby and I was also able to eat lunch at a bench across the street.  Also got to talk to some locals who were passing by and had some questions about my hike.  As soon as the PO opened up I went in for my box.  All I could think of was how heavy it is and I'm going to have to carry this uphill out of town.  It was packed with goodies that I ate immediately and Lisa had even put a Christmas tree air freshener in there for me - Ha Ha.  
Back on trail by 2:30 and on to the next town of Dalton.  When I got to the trail head I met a local guy named Jeremy.He was looking at the map on the bulletin board.  He asked how long I'd been on the trail and was shocked when I told him since May 8th.  He had just moved to the area recently and had no idea about the Appalachian Trail.  It's still fun answering all the questions people have.  
The trail goes right through the town of Dalton for about 2 miles so I had a nice level road walk.    There was a campsite listed in town as Levardi's.  It's actually the home of Tom Levardi.  He's been letting AT hikers camp in his yard for 37 years!!!  You have to knock on the door and get permission and then he goes over a list of rules.  Mainly just being considerate of his neighbors and not making a mess of his porch.  He has water and a power strip to recharge your devices.  I was the only one here for the night and got set up pretty quickly.  I was looking forward to eating some of the weight out of my heavy food bag.  As I was boiling my water for dinner, the neighbor peeked over the fence and asked if I like quiche.  I HATE to say no to food but I explained to her how heavy my food bag was and that I was trying to lighten it.  I felt like I was cursing myself for not accepting a food offering and that the trail would punish me later on.  Just as I was heading to my tent for the night, Tom came out of the house with dessert!!Cake and ice cream - no way I was turning it down.  20.7 miles even with the long break this afternoon is pretty good, I'll sleep good tonight.","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

Late start today- 7:45, just didn't want to get up. The plan was to head into Salisbury to resupply.  There are a couple of hostels (homes) here in town but I have no plans on staying here.  Could definitely use a shower though.  Nice easy walking this morning.Met up with Shoe Wizard and Stokes in Salisbury around 10:00.  There's a nice supermarket and a little cafe.  Did a resupply and grabbed a sandwich and coffee and hung around in the courtyard where there were power outlets.  Stokes had to charge his battery backup and it was slow but I had no problem hanging out in civilization for a little longer.  As we're siting there enjoying the weather and chairs Dotcom comes walking up!! She took my pic at the midway point in Harpers Ferry and I bumped into her again in Maine.  Her and her friend Queen were out for a section hike.  Queen has been working on the AT for a little while and should have all the sections complete next April.  While she was here, I asked Dotcom exactly what she was doing in ME when I saw her last and she explained to me that she was doing research for a book that is coming out next year about the woman that got lost in the 100 mile wilderness.  As it turns out, Dotcom and Queen were the last ones to see her alive and even had a conversation with her (as Dotcom explained she is a chatty one).  The whole story is pretty tragic.  Finally got back on trail at 4:00 and were still motivated to do the 20 miles.  Had to change our plans and settle for 17 and a half.  This included doing some night  hiking till 8:30.  Kind of creepy hiking at night.  All I could see were headlamps far away.  I kept thinking that the guys got so far ahead and I wasn't catching up.  It turns out that there were another group of 3 hikers (NOBOs) night hiking as well and it was their headlamps I was seeing in the distance.  We did finally cross paths and the 6 of us in the dark in the middle of the woods chatting was kind of odd.  Finally made it to the tentsite and Stokes got a nice fire going quickly.  Cooked dinner and I was off to bed at 10:00 - pretty late for me.","Brassie Brook Shelter

Another beautiful day but starting to get humid.  Came out to Stewart Brook which is more like a river.  The trail follows a path along side of the river.  It was pretty hot and humid and I would have loved to have jumped in for a swim but the water smelled terrible and there was foamy junk floating down it.  No way I'm getting in that.  Met a group of ladies from a UCONN activities club- out for a walk.  They had lots of questions about the trail and my hike- they were great.  Shot a text out to Stokes and Shoe Wizard to see how far behind me they were.  Turns they did go for a swim and were quite a bit behind me.  We decided on meetin up at Mt Algo which was a little after a road crossing.  The original plan was 25 miles for the day but sometimes you need to relax and enjoy the scenery.  With the change of plans I reached the road crossing pretty early and only had 1.5 to do so I thumbed a ride to Kent (1 mile away) for ice cream and grilled cheese.  This is the 1st time I had to thumb a ride and was picked up by the 2nd car that passed.  A guy in a pickup pulled over which was for the best - I wouldn't want to get in anyone's car with the way I smell - I haven't had a real shower since VT.  I jumped out as soon as he pulled over at the ice cream shop to let him get on his way and he got out to point out all the stuff in town - Library that way, laundromat that way, restaurant over there.  Very helpful. I sent out a text to the guys to let them know it was worth the trip if they could get here before it closes at 5.  Stokes was motivated and made it there just before closing.  Unfortunately thumbing a ride back to the trail just wasn't happening, luckily it was only 1 mile away.  Got back to the trailhead and it was uphill for 1.5 miles to the shelter.  Made it there around 7 and met Macaroni. This guy got off the trail for 8 weeks to go work in Alaska at a salmon processing plant.  I asked him how he managed to find a job like that while he was hiking and he told me he found it online (I forget the name of the site).  He made crazy money and overtime , they took care of room and board and he worked so much he didn't have any time to spend the money.  Sounds like an adventure.  We got the fire going and Shoe Wizard came rolling in a little bit later.  Set up in the shelter tonight, it's supposed to rain.","Sharon Mountain Campsite

Mt Algo Shelter to Tony's Deli (Pawling NY)
No rush this morning and started a little after 8:00, I knew we were only doing 18 miles today.  Highlight of the day was that I crossed in to NY!!  Still stuck in this bubble of heat and humidity.  As I came up on a trailhead parking area, it started to rain and there was a nice kiosk set up with maps and other info.  The kiosk had a nice pitched roof that was just big enough for me to lay down under so I took a little nap.  The rain stopped and started for the next few hours so I did end up getting wet eventually. Passed by Wiley Shelter so I was able to have a nice dry lunch.  Caught up with Shoe Wizard and came out to Rt 22 and the Appalachian Trail train stop.  We had a .7 mile road walk to Tony's Deli where they let you camp out back for like $2 or something.  They also have a grill and pretty good resupply. They also have an inside table with TV and lucky for us it was Thursday night and we were able to catch a football game. There is also WiFi here!! Such a bonus! Had huge double burger and ice cream dessert.  Still kind of smelly though.  I'm on my 3rd state with no shower and none in sight.  That's got to be one of the worst parts of this whole hike is the constant feel of being grimy.  But there's no way to get around it.  Even when I do get a shower in town, as soon as I head back on the trail I'm a sweaty mess in minutes.  The only downside of this place is that it is right between highway and train tracks.  Loud trucks and train whistles all night long.","Mt Algo Shelter

Tony's Deli (Pawling NY) to RPH Shelter 
Didn't sleep so well with the trains and trucks all night.  I kept worrying about trucks careening off the highway and taking us all out and when I wasn't worrying about that, the train horns would blast.  Should've brought ear plugs but I'm not so sure they would even help.  Woke up early and had a great breakfast and coffee and packed out a hoagie for lunch.  Stokes and Shoe Wizard were taking their time packing up so I got going.  I'm not good at sitting in the morning when I'm all packed up.  Lunchtime is another story but I'm definitely antsy in the morning. That's why I got my trailname after all.  It was a nice easy hike this morning around a huge lake.  Met Bob and Linda around Nuclear Lake- we spoke for a while and she even knew what a flip flop hike was! I think she's the 1st non thru-hiker I've talked to that knew what that was.  They said they'd like to do the trail someday.  I told them why wait.  If it's something you want to do, sometimes you just have to do it.  The perfect time may never arrive.  Another hot and humid day, I seem to be stuck in this pattern.  Made good miles this morning and had half the hoagie for 1st lunch and took a nap.  Had the other half a couple hours later so I could order more food at RPH.  This is one of 3 or 4 shelters on the trail that you can order delivery to.  About 3 miles from the shelter I got stung in the head by a bee - didn't know if I'd have an allergic reaction - other than a big welt on my head.  Got to the shelter around 5:15 and immediately ordered some Chinese.  Shoe Wizard came in about 6:30 followed by Stokes and his new shoes around 7:15.  He had to hitch all the way into Wingdale to pick up shoes that he ordered online.  He has a knack for hitching and getting in and out of town.  My gear is kinda damp so I hung it up for a bit before I set up in one of the bunks in the shelter.  Getting pretty nasty, really need a shower and laundry.  Trying to do a big day tomorrow to set up a Nero for Sunday and Ft Montgomery.  The 3 of us are planning on splitting a room in Ft.

Another hot humid day.  Got off to an early start with the promise of a shower and room tomorrow.  Stokes called and made the reservation and we're all set.  Try to bust out a ton of miles today so we have a short day into town and enough time to do chores early and relax.  Found a nice clearing in a park to eat lunch and try to dry out my gear which is still damp from the rain a couple days ago.  There was also a hose faucet here so I was able to refill my water bottles.  Had a nice lunch in the sun and packed up my slightly drier gear.  Ate as much as I wanted since I was going to resupply in town tomorrow.  Always nice to have a light pack. Texted Stokes and Shoe Wizard to let them know about the water and Stokes let me know that he decided to cancel the room reservation.  Wasn't too happy about that, he could've let me know beforehand.  There were no cheap options in town so it was just too expensive to do with just 2 of us.  No shower, ugh.  Walking angry means walking fast.  Came to a road crossing at an intersection and there was a mini mart.  Heard about the quesadillas here so I ordered one.  This place also had limited resupply options, kind of pricey but what can you do.  My quesadilla was made and it fit in a large pizza box -  nice!  Sat outside at some picnic tables and scarfed down the whole thing.  It wasn't easy even with my hiker appetite - that's saying something.  Full belly and still angry about not getting a room tomorrow so I powered up the hill and walked until I didn't feel like walking anymore.  Found a nice stealth spot and called it a day.","RPH Shelter

Pack on my back the entire time just standing there inching away while he kept going.  Nice guy but damn.  Back on trail up Bear Mt, they say you can see the NY city skyline from here but that was not happening today - cloudy and raining.  Energy was good and I was cruising past all the day hikers that braved the shitty weather on a weekend day.  Got past the crowds and ran into 2 hikers going the opposite way. A guy and a lady.  He said I was the second SOBO he saw today, said he just passed a young SOBO from Tennessee.  I asked if he had a blue shirt on and he says yea.  I think that could be Destiny.  Haven't seen him since the day before Rutland VT.  This guy says that he just got done helping a bunch of his friends summit Katahdin and he was heading home but wanted to do this section.  I asked what his friends trailnames were and he said they didn't have any?  He said that what he does every year and I said you sound like someone else I've heard of but I couldn't remember his name.  The lady says this is the same guy - Warren Doyle!  I said I met you in NH and he told me he remembered my new boots.  Insane how I keep running into people on the trail - Just like Dotcom. He was with Ina- The Enchantress of the North as they were heading south after watching his expedition Summit Katahdin yesterday.  Also passed another father,son,daughter group. Hot and sweaty today- got a nice stream bath at least.  Sat right down in the water and rung out the clothes until the water came out clear.  Even washed my back up clothes.  Got moving again and came to a shelter where I ran into Destiny who had decided to stay there.  We caught up a bit and I told him I still had some miles left in me today so I moved on.  Found a nice stealth spot on a hill top- may even get to see some stars.  Cooked a Ramen dinner and in the tent as it's getting dark at 7:30.","SB mile 782

I was spoiled up north with the cool temps and no bugs (or snorers).  There were signs on the trail that advertised for a hostel so as soon as I had service I called the number.Originally I was trying to make a reservation for tomorrow night.  I said it was a possibility that I may make it there tonight if I can do 20+ miles today but she told me she does pick ups on a bunch of road crossings and asked where I'd like to be picked up.  I was so relieved!  I'm actually going to get a shower today!!  Instead of being energetic and excited to get to town, my body just fizzled out - I'm sure I've been overdoing it the past 2 weeks.  Also the adrenaline boost I got from being under 500 miles left is starting to wear off.  Had cell service and called about 2 miles from the next road crossing and told her I would be there in an hour at the latest.  Mosey came and picked me up in her jeep and headed back into NY to her hostel/home.  There were 2 others there already - Wiki and Kokopelli.  I've seen Kokopelli's journal online before - she is doing the trail in sections over several years.  Was so glad to get a shower and do some laundry!!

Easy gradual climb up to High Point. Didn't do the .3 side trail to the monument - I had been there a couple years before and I was definitely NOT climbing the tower again.  There was an observation platform right on the trail so I got a nice view of the tower.

Passed 1900 miles at lunch!  These milestones are always a boost to the motivation.  Originally the plan was to get to the Mohican Outdoor Center but I think I'm going to push on past it.  I need to make the miles whenever possible to stay on pace.  I've thought about pushing the finish date to the following Tuesday but I have the idea to finish the entire trail in 5 months or less.  Was hiking the ridge and passed a fire tower where I met a couple South Jersey folks! 1st I met Ana and Larry from Franklinville - that's about 5 minutes from my town.  They were just up here for a couple days out on the trail.  Then I met a guy named John from Malaga - it turns out I worked at the same hospital as his mother.  Small world.  Made some good miles today and ended up camping with Fleet - a SOBO from Rochester NY.  Found a nice stealth spot on top of the ridge.  Was able to catch a sunset also - not too many chances for that, I better enjoy them while I can.","Gren Anderson Shelter

The days are getting shorter very quickly.  I usually wake up and start packing in the dark and the sun is up by the time I'm done.  I""m still amazed that I can't get my pack up time under 45 minutes.  The time goes so fast.  Anyway, I was up a little earlier today and since I'm up on a ridge, I was hoping to get a sunrise view.  I came up on Racoon Ridge and the sky had a little bit of pink in it so I found a spot on a rock and had my breakfast.  The colors were incredible and I'm pretty sure I used half the memory of my phone taking pic after pic.  So glad I got to see this.  I feel like I cheated the system since I didn't even have to wake up super early to get to see this.  Fleet came hiking up just as the sun was up and was able to catch the tail end of it while he ate his breakfast.  I got hiking and was excited to be crossing in to PA later today.  The Delaware Water Gap has some nice park facilities with a campground, bathrooms, sinks (Woohoo), and hoses to fill up water bottles.  Fleet had made it down to the gap just as I was getting ready to cross the bridge into PA.  This guy walks fast - takes tons of breaks and then flies by me.  Walked into the town of Delaware Water Gap PA and went straight to the Post Office to pick up a resupply box that Lisa mailed me. I tell her how many meals I need and she puts them in a box and mails it off to me but she always puts some nice surprises in there.  It's like trail Christmas every time!! I usually scarf down everything extra to keep my pack weight down and this time Fleet was there so he got some trail Christmas too.  Hard time finding a place in town to charge the phone and battery back up.  There was a little bakery with coffee but not very hiker helpful.  They were nice people but most trail towns have outlets (and sometimes even WiFi) everywhere because hikers buy stuff when they need to hang out and charge equipment.  Everytime I come across situations like this, it makes me appreciative of the technology that I have  that hikers from years ago did not.  They had heavy gear and external packs with metal frames.  Heavy tents and big leather boots.  Probably had to carry a big heavy trail guide that couldn't possibly have the up to date info that my phone app has.  Gotta give them credit - as hard as the trail is for me, it was much harder for them.  I do think about that a lot when I'm run down and feeling sorry for myself.  Found a pizza place with outlets at the tables and decided to have a few slices and charge up.  Fleet still needed to resupply and the only option in town is a gas station mini mart down the road (which is why I had Lisa send me mine). So I headed out and had no doubts that he would catch up later.  The trail went straight up Mt Minsi and into the rocks of PA - not so bad yet but I'm certain that will change.  I'll enjoy this while it lasts.  Came up to the shelter and look who it is - Destiny.  Haven't seen Stokes or Shoe Wizard in a while now, not sure how far back they are. At shelter with Stretch, Wild Child, Fleet, and Destiny.  Hung out till it got dark and then went to my tent","Tentsite at 887.7

Heard someone rustling around early this morning so I just got up.  It was 5:45 and still dark.  On the trail at 6:45- too slow this morning but had to fill up on water.  I'm coming up to a stretch of very dry miles. Very little water today- only 1 spot to refill at 14 miles and no water at campsite tonight unless I go 30 miles to the next shelter which is not happening.  Trail elevation profile looks pretty level but the rocks started about a mile in when I hit Wolf Rocks.  You know it's rocky when they have their own name.  3 straight hours of rock trail - foot bruising, toe crushing rocks.  Hop from one to the other, hard to get a rhythm but just have to be patient- I keep telling myself that this is the last real challenge for me and that calms me down for a bit, until I stub my toe or stumble and trip and then it's back to screaming curse words.  Not strenuous, just difficult.  Was able to make good time though without breaking a sweat.  Came up to the only water source of the day which was at a shelter but of course the spring was .5 straight downhill.  I brought all my bottles and my filter bag (another 2L).  There were a couple guys ahead of me filling their bottles and I notice that the 1 guy had a pistol on his belt.  Being from NJ, I'm still fascinated when I see people open carry.  It was a lot more common down south but up here it's just a little different.  Doesn't bother me one way or another it's just not as common up here.  Anyway, it was probably in the mid 80's and the water was so nice and cool - it had to be a spring.  Loaded up with 4 liters- more than I've carried the entire trip and headed back up the trail to the shelter to pack up and get moving.  Patiently walked the last 11.3 to the Tentsite where Destiny has already set up.  Made a quick dinner and off to bed.  25 miles in 12 hours and the days are getting shorter very quickly.","Kirkridge Shelter

Up at 5:45 on trail by 6:45. Had to go down into Lehigh Gap and back up the other side- this is probably my last big climb of the trip.  There are more climbs but I don't think any are this big.  I've heard about the Superfund site around here where all the trees died off from smelting years ago.  The town of Palmerton was down below on the other side of the river and I just wondered how people felt living down there so close to the past damage.  Came out to a boulder field and had to head straight down. Very scary - huge boulder scrambling, if I was to trip, not sure where I would eventually stop bouncing.  The river maybe?  Way up was easy but I had to stop for water.  I'm pretty sure this is the only water source again today and it was getting hot - about 88.  The trail was a nice path mixed with long stretches of rocks and boulders.  Came out at a road crossing and looked up the road.  I heard there was a restaurant and I'm not one to road walk far, but I could see this one so I was going.  Came up to the Blue Mountain Restaurant (right next to road crossing at 309) around 3:30 and grabbed a bite to eat and got to catch the 4th quarter of the Eagles game- awesome ending!  Food was incredible too!  The owners let hikers camp out back and fill up on water as well. As much as I'd like to eat dinner tonight and breakfast here tomorrow, I need to keep moving.  Topped off the water bottles and got going.  Not sure where Destiny is planning to end his day but I'm just going until I don't feel like it anymore.  Last 4 miles to the shelter were still very warm- only going down to 67 all night.  The area around here is too rocky so I can't rely on finding a stealth spot so I'm stuck going to the shelter and this one is kind of far off trail.  .5 miles I think.  Got to the shelter and there were 2 guys from NC out for a week or so.  Set up the tent and had dinner, off to bed as soon as the sun went down.  Planning 22 tomorrow into Port Clinton and Carl is coming to visit early Tuesday","Tentsite at 927.6

Slept in a bit for no good reason.  Thought it was only 20 miles into town today and when I found out it was 21.9 I was bummed.  It's amazing that only 1.9 would make that much of a difference but that's about 40 more minutes of walking in the heat that I hadn't planned on.  Just a mental hurdle - the body can do it no problem.  Another hot and humid day- 90 degrees.  Still in the rocks also but there were a few stretches of nice trail on dirt roads.  Came up to a section of trail that I've done before and had lunch at the Pinnacle.  I didn't even go to the overlook that's .3 off trail because I've seen it so many times before.  I just sat at the huge rock pile at the trail junction and ate my lunch.  I had gotten a text from one of my old coworkers so I was able to give him a call back and see how things are going at the old place.  Turns out my job hasn't been filled yet so maybe I'll see if I can go back there when the hike is over.  Obviously my perspective about my old job has evolved since beginning the hike and also I've come to terms with the fact that I do actually like working a 9 to 5.  I don't have a single regret about leaving the job to do this -  as a matter of fact it's just the opposite.  So glad I was able to do this but it will be over soon and I have to start thinking about my next steps rejoining the normal world. Finished lunch and moved on to Pulpit Rock overlooking the campground that my son and I camped at every year.  I never realized the rocks were so bad in this section while we were doing our day hikes up here but after 3 days of rocks rocks rocks my feet want to give up.  With the heat came the gnats!! Terrible gnats buzzing in front of my eyes and in my ears. I'm convinced the trail gods are making sure I pay my dues with the heat in this section.  It's definitely a little easier to take knowing that I'll be done in a week or so but there is very little enjoyment hiking in this.  I remember back in the beginning of the trail I would write about that for all the good days, the trail collects it's dues eventually.  It's  not fun on days like this but they can't all be winners.  Made it to the trailhead at Rt 61 around 5:30.  I was miserable and uncomfortable and beat up.  I called Steve, a local shuttle driver, and was at the Microtel in 10 minutes.  Showered up and headed to the steakhouse across the street with Destiny. Ate entirely too much and headed back to room for the night.  Even got to watch some MNF.  I'm excited to see Carl and Susan tomorrow- they are coming to Hamburg to provide some trail magic!","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

It was so nice to be clean and sleep in a bed. In no rush this morning because Carl and his wife Susan are coming to visit and provide some trail magic- my only regret is that I didn't have more hikers for them to meet. Destiny had gotten a shuttle back to the trail early so he could do 26+ miles to the 501 Shelter.  I needed to resupply and find out if Merrell was sending replacement boots- my boots have fallen apart in the past 3 days to the point that soles are about to fall off (after only 40 days) 
Carl and Susan came nice and early and we went over to the Cracker Barrel for breakfast. I love the breakfasts there!!!
Since I hadn't been journaling so much, Carl had a ton of questions which I never get tired of answering and I got to fill him in on all the details that don't get written about.  They had an adventure of their own to fill me in on as well.  It meant a lot to me that they came out to visit and help me out with the town chores as well.  Thanks again guys!!!
Got on trail around 1:00 right where I left off yesterday.  Climb straight up out of Port Clinton was a surprise.  Very steep with no steps, straight up sand and gravel for 800' in .5 miles. Add in the 88 degree heat and it was a killer! I was a sweaty mess within 5 minutes and the shower and clean clothes were a distant memory.  The New Balance trail runners that I picked up feel great.  More rocks, more heat, more gnats means I have to be more patient.  The jagged PA rocks are wearing me down like a cheese grater.  There's gonna be nothing left of me by the time I'm through them!
Other than the big climb, the trail was relatively level with patches of rocks and boulder fields.  They aren't strenuous but they're difficult none the less.  
Reached the Eagles Nest Shelter around 5:00. It was early but I had to stop here for water and I figured a half day after a hotel night may be the best thing for me before I make the final push.  I still plan on finishing next Tuesday even though it's unlikely- it's not yet a mathematical impossibility.  I plan on getting a couple30 milers before my hike is over so now is the time!!
Met Strider and Positive Traction at the shelter. 2 nice guys from NC out for a section hike.  Had dinner together and it was nice chatting with them.  Early to bed tonight to start the big miles tomorrow- only 1 more hot day to go before the weather breaks.","Rt 61 trailhead in Hamburg PA

Crazy long day!! On trail by 6:15 (still dark) and feeling a little sluggish from the long day yesterday.  The weather is supposed to break today and I can't wait- but it's still a little muggy this morning.  The plan is to keep the breaks short and to a minimum.  Every minute seems to count when you want to make big miles.  Had a lot of snacks packed in the hip belt to help me put off lunch till I know if I'm going into Duncannon today.  I had originally planned to get there Friday but it looks like it could be possible today.  Saw a rattlesnake as I climbed over a rocky ridge- he was rattling frantically so I got a better look and he had the back end of another rattlesnake sticking out of his mouth!  He took off as soon as he saw me checking him out.  Didn't know they ate each other.  Had lunch at the Peters Mountain Shelter where I met Sequoia, Camel, and Sweet Monkey.  They were all headed to the Doyle as well and told me there was only one room left and that I should reserve it so I immediately called and got it reserved. 11.7 to go and it's already 3:00 - I have to be there before the desk closes at 8:00.  I was there just before 7:00 and totally beat up from pushing it the last 11 miles, the hike down was brutal and seemed like it would never end.  Then I had a 2 mile road walk through the little town.  Right down the sidewalk.  This place is a legend among the hikers mainly because it's right on the trail (which goes through the center of town) and because of how dirty it is.  There's a story about a hiker that put toe nail clippings in a dresser drawer and they remained there for 4 or 5 years.  After staying there, I can say I totally believe it now.  Ordered a BBQ pork sandwich from the bar to hold me off till I ordered a pizza from across the street.  Got checked into my room which had an unlevel bed and took a shower in the bathroom down the hall.  Not sure if I came out dirtier - this place is a complete dump but it has a roof and electricity.  You can tell they don't even try anymore.  Full belly and sore feet- time for bed.","Stealthsite at 1009

Slept pretty good considering the bed was tilted to the side and was trying to dump me out all night.  Got to sleep in a bit too since I have to pick up a box from the PO and they do t open till 8:00.  Up at 7:15 and went across the street to the little breakfast place for some coffee and pancakes- my new favorite breakfast!! I know I'm going to have to lay off these when I get home - either that or walk 20 miles whenever I have them.  Sat at the counter with the regulars and listened to their stories about driving truck and riding Harley's. A local old timer that I was sitting next to told me how the Doyle used to be a nice place and he actually lived there for a couple of years in the early 1950's.  He said he could get loaded in the bar downstairs but have to walk up 4 flights of stairs to make it to his room.  
After breakfast I picked up my resupply box from the PO and realized that this is my last one!! I went through my food bag and got rid of anything old and only took enough food for 4 days. I started the day with 120 miles to Harper's Ferry and there are a few snack bars along the way so I don't have to carry those meals either. Also packed out the rest of the pizza I got last night.  
All packed and on the trail at 9:30- a little later than I had hoped but what can you do.  A nice climb out of town and the miles fly by.  There's a nice long stretch of about 14 miles of level trail today that I should make good time on.  
Stopped for lunch at 12:30 and finished the pizza on another break at 3:30. By 6:30 the back had enough. Pushed on till about 7:30 and found a flat spot on the edge of a hay field to set up.  The trail goes right through Boiling Springs tomorrow and I'm definitely stopping in the diner for coffee (and maybe pancakes too).","The Doyle Hotel, Duncannon PA

On trail at 6:45 and came out to the road in Boining Springs not long after.  Came up to Cafe 101 and got a table next to an outlet to charge up a little more.  Had some WiFi too!!!  Had an awesome breakfast and met Mary Ellen and Werner from  Baltimore.  They had the usual questions about life on the trail which NEVER GET OLD.  I mean that - it's awesome to see peoples interest in trail life and the adventure that comes with it.  Finished up breakfast and headed out for the remainder of the road walk through town.  As I walked past the man made pond in the center of town, I think everyone I passed said Welcome to Boiling Springs.  No kidding!  All the little well kept houses and manicured postage stamp lawns were an awesome example of small town charm.  I've been through so many this trip - it's definitely one of the highlights of the entire trip -  all the small towns.  Got back in the woods and saw some hunters- made me worry a bit since I don't have any bright orange to wear.  Spoke with a father and son who were out hunting - the son was about 13 and had a crossbow.  I asked what they were out for and the father said since the boy was young, he's technically allowed to hunt anything.  I quickly told him no hikers though!

On trail at 6:45 and it was downright chilly this morning- I think in the 40's.  I thought it was supposed to go up into the 70's later but it never got over 65 but I'll take it!!  This is my last Sunday morning- I've had a lot of nice Sunday morning walks this summer- it just seems quieter for some reason. I hiked until dark last night with the intention to go further but chickened out when I found a flat spot.  That and the fact that I was hiking in a place called Dead Woman Hollow.  Kinda creepy but tired beats out creepy every time.  I have no problem sleeping like a baby even alone in a place called Dead Woman Hollow.  Turns out it was good thing I stopped for the day because the place I wanted to get to was still smoldering from controlled burn fires.  The signs on the trees said that they were planned for May but I cannot believe that they would still be smoldering from May.  The ground was charred and there were still red embers on both sides of the trail that were flaring with the gentle breeze this morning.  Also little streams of smoke rising from all the hot areas, pretty neat actually.  Lunch at Caledonia State Park in the picnic area.  Snack bar was closed though but no problem - I have enough food to get me through as planned.  Met Shep and his dog Ollie and Good Grip and Too Tall from Germany.    I'm thinking a lot about what I'm going to do when I get back- all the food I'm going to cook, all the stuff around the house I want to get done.  I was also thinking how tomorrow will be my last full day of hiking- the last opportunity to get a 30+ mile day in.  It's hard to think about anything else really.  I'm also looking forward to finishing on a Tuesday like I had hoped.  My body has also had enough. I'm not sure I could make it all the way to Georgia if I was a true SOBO with only 1100+ miles - the pain has gotten intense.  But I can push it knowing that I have the time to rest when I get home.","Stealthsite at SB mile 1093.7

On trail at 6:45 as the sun is just coming up - any earlier and I'd need my headlamp.  Seems like I finally have a good consistent schedule.  Trying to get another 30+ mile day to set up a short day to finish.  Crossed into Maryland at 7:30 and entered PenMar park.  There was a water fountain so I was able to fill up my water bottles.  It's such a luxury to have water that doesn't need treatment or filtering.  It's really a speed thing.  When you have to set up the filter or treatment drops, it can take 15 minutes or so just to get water.
The trail looked pretty level on my app but the rocks were the wildcard.  Just trying to be patient when I come across them and make good time when there aren't any.  There were a few nice climbs of 500' and 800' and I was happy to have them knowing that there won't be any more.  
Got hungry early so I had lunch around 11:30 at the Ensign Cowall Shelter.  I stayed here a couple years ago on a weekend hike with the OCSJ.  As I got to the shelter, I met a group of 3 guys out for their very 1st backpack trip.  They were asking about the terrain up ahead so I showed them my app.  They were very over-prepared and they knew it. They were all carrying huge packs and kept saying how it was their 1st trip.  They were wondering if they could get 8 more miles today and I just told them to take their time and be patient.  They had jeans and cotton t-shirts on - probably the absolute worse thing to wear for hiking.  
Finished my lunch by noon and got moving quickly.  No time for lounging around if I want to get 30 miles in.  Passed the 1st timers in about 30 minutes on a nice steep climb.  2 of them looked miserable and I know that feeling of being wiped out on a climb. I tried to be encouraging letting them know they were almost at the top and that it was the last big climb of the day.  
The weather has been incredible since the heat broke a couple days ago and I don't think I've had to hike in the rain since MA.  I'll take it!! I came up to the original Washington Monument and climbed the steps to the top.  It's only about 40-50' tall.  There were a couple of guys up there with cameras getting pictures of the migrating hawks.  The past couple of days have had a few nice parks that I'd like to visit when I have more time to explore.  It was about 4:30 and the park had a pavilion with picnic tables so I figured I could have dinner here now and walk until dark instead of walking till I can't stand the hunger anymore.  I cooked up 2 packages of Spanish rice, my last dinners.  The food bag is getting nice and light!! My gas canister also ran out so it was perfect timing!  Since I was in a park, there was also water and trash cans.  I was able to lighten up my bag and it's really starting to sink in that this hike is just about done.  
Tonight is my last chance to get some night hiking in so I had an energy drink mix at 5:30 - hope I'm able to sleep tonight.  I had the last climb of my trip just as the sun was setting so I got some good views from the top and it got dark quickly as I headed back down.  It was neat how as the sun went down, the bugs got louder.  The trail also got pretty rocky and was tough to make any time, especially with the darkness.  I put on my headlamp and moved along.  After I got my 30 miles I started looking for a flat spot to set up on for the night.  I'll admit I was getting a little creeped out at all the noises coming from the sides of the trail and it was tough to look to the sides with the rocky trail -  I had to keep my head facing forward and looking down.  At one point I stopped to look to the right and there were a set of eyes looking right at me!  I thought it was a wolf or coyote just from the height of it so I kept moving.  About 20 yds up the trail I look to my right again and there's another set of eyes but this time I could see clearly that it was a deer.  I told him to get away or he's gonna get eaten by a wolf!  
Finally found what I thought was a flat spot to set up on.  Blew up the sleeping pad and got all set up in the tent and realized that it was sloped pretty bad - Oh well, I'm not moving now.  Set the alarm for 5:30 to get an extra early start tomorrow and off to sleep.","Stealthsite at 1123.7

The alarm went off at 6:00 and I immediately opened the valve on my sleeping pad.  I started packing my gear in the complete darkness - I've become so efficient these last few weeks.  Everything goes in its spot at night so I know just where to find it in the morning.  I had to put on the headlamp at the end to pick out my breakfast which I ate in the tent before packing that up.  On trail by 6:45 and it would've been earlier if I could hike in the dark.  The trail was pretty rocky and was the main reason I stopped hiking in the dark last night.  That and the eyes that were illuminated every time I looked off trail while I was searching for a flat spot to set up. I thought I had found a nice flat spot to set up on but it was slanted quite a bit and my sleeping pad kept sliding over or I kept rolling off of it.  Needless to say I didn't sleep well for a number of reasons.  The energy drink I had with dinner last night may have been a part of it also but I think it was mostly the excitement to be finished.  
With only a little more than 12 miles left, the plan was to finish before lunch so I packed a lot of snacks in my hip belt.  Hopefully the last granola bars I ever have to eat for the rest of my life.  The only elevation for today is when I descend into town for the last time.  It's amazing to think I won't be waking up in the woods tomorrow and hiking all day.  The weather has been almost perfect for the past week and this morning is no different, sunny and cool.  As I started the big descent it finally hit home that this is the last one.  I'm going into civilization and not returning to the woods this time.  A very important realization early on was that town time is only temporary and you must do your stuff and get back in the woods.  I've seen so many people on this trip head into town and decide to stay.  It is tempting after all.  Food, showers, and a bed are not to be taken lightly.  
I came out at a road crossing and took a deep breath.  The rest of the trail runs along the C&O canal before crossing a bridge over the Potomac and into the little town of Harper's Ferry.  The 2 miles of the canal walk took forever but I did see a bald eagle.  After crossing the bridge the trail follows a road for a block or two before heading up some stairs and skirting a cliff around the town.  The trail was barely marked and I had to use the app on my phone, pointing it in different directions like a compass.  The ATC building was only a couple blocks up the road but the trail snaked around the town just for some bonus miles.  Because the ATC is about .5 off the AT, I actually completed the trail at the steps that head into town.  I came up to the steps and looked down the trail that I walked up back in July and that was it!  I put my hand on the tree that's right there also and took a deep breath - it's over!! Back in July I didn't realize that this spot would be so important.  I had planned on continuing north and the decision to flip hadn't been made yet.  As I was standing there processing it all, a hiker was coming down the steps.  He asked how long I was out for and told him this was it - I'm done.  He introduced himself as Jamaica and said he was out for a section hike.  He's been working on completing the AT in sections for a few years now.  Then he said ""wait -  you just finished the whole thing?"" and I said yea and he congratulated me and asked if he was the 1st to find out.  He got a kick out of being the 1st to see a ""new thru hiker"".  I headed up to the ATC headquarters and walked in to see Dotcom at the desk - right where she said she'd be.  She recognized me and asked if I finished.  I told her I did and she got everyone in the building together and we had a toast of Apple Cider Champagne in fancy glasses and all!!  I got my picture taken in front of the sign and that was it.  It's done! All of it!!  Now I'm just a tourist in Harper's Ferry and have to make arrangements to get home.  I booked a train ticket to Philadelphia and headed down to the Town's Inn to get a bunk for the night.  It's the same place I stayed on my flip and was a good deal for just a bed in a hostel. 
I still can't believe it's all over.  5 months and 40 lbs.  Oh yea - and 2190.3 miles!!","Stealthsite at 1154.4

Quick Start,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605242,"Just finished updating all the entries of my journal.  I had kept notes and bullet points in my phone that I would type up almost every night and believe it or not, the memories are still clear - even after a whole year + off the trail.  Some are fading though so it was important to get it all down as much as possible.  A whole year has passed by and I miss the trail more as the time goes by.  When I got home, I put the pack in the basement and seriously wondered if I would ever touch that thing again.  I ended up going back to my old job in November.  I really missed the people I worked with for 15 years so it was nice to go back.  I also got to tell them all about the trip.  I did feel guilty about taking that time away and then coming back - I know it's irrational and I didn't get paid while I was gone but I know everyone has dreams of leaving their work to pursue whatever they want and most people don't get to do them.  In actuality, I didn't quit my job in order to hike the trail, the timing just happened to be ideal.  But the fact that I did quit my job gave me motivation to never give up. There were a few times that I thought to myself ""I quit my job, I have to finish this trail!""   I took the chance and got to do something I wanted to for a long time and I'm incredibly grateful.  I was surprised at the number of people in my age range that quit their jobs to go for the adventure.  I thought it was going to be all college kids and retirees.  It's great to see that so many people can let go of the fear that comes with leaving a job with nothing lined up and pursue something that makes them happy.  We are more than our jobs.  It's a scary thing to leave the comfort and stability (and health insurance) of your career to head into the unknown, to go do something that 75% of people fail at (thru-hiker completion rates are only around 25%).  There are plenty of jobs out there for when you eventually have to go back to work.   
By February I was watching people on YouTube starting their hikes (Scoutmaster on the AT was a good one).  By March I had my pack out and cleaning up my gear and getting it back in order.  No trips in the spring but I was able to get to NH for a weekend trip in late August.  I still have a bunch of 4000'ers to complete.  
It seems like I miss the trail more and more as the time goes by but my adventure now is my new job.  I'd like to get out and do some trail magic near some of the towns that I had a good time in and make a vacation out of it.","
