David Reid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514708,"Well I have decided that hiking the trail is something I am going to do. I have wanted to thru hike for quite a few years now and in 2017 I will get my chance. I retire from the Army on July 29, 2017. I will have 90 days of leave saved up so I will set out somewhere between May 1st and June 1st. I feel like that is too late to start a NOBO hike and I don't really want to flip flop. Looks like a perfect time to start a SOBO and the fact that this is the less chosen path makes it even more appealing to me. I need to start buying gear!",,View Entry,"Sep 29, Tue",0
David Reid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516536,"My thru hike is starting to take shape. I now have 2 out of 3 major items (sleeping bag coming soon). The more research I do, the more I want to get started!",,View Entry,"Oct 27, Tue",0
David Reid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516606,"Food is on my mind. There are tons of books and research dedicated to hiking the AT but finding what everyone is eating has proven difficult. I have been researching freeze dried food and of course it is expensive! Another option has been to learn to freeze dry my own food. I am in the experimental stages with this but so far so good. Lots of YouTube channels dedicated to this however most of them are kind of nuts, but hey aren't we all in our own ways?",,View Entry,"Oct 30, Fri",0
David Reid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519316,"I am a little behind in updating my journal, go figure. A couple of days before Thanksgiving Landon (13YO Son) and I went to Newfound Gap and hiked from there to Clingmans Dome. I was a little tough because we were not conditioned for the hills but it was a great time. Lessons learned: 1. Bring your tent even if you do not plan on staying in it because you have a reservation in a shelter. GSMNP requires section hikers to stay in shelters and require a reservation. We planned on staying in a shelter about 4 miles from Newfound Gap because of the late start we would get because of the drive from Raleigh to the Gap. Great plan and we did the 4 miles in a couple of hours but missed the turn for the shelter which is .5 miles from the AT on a side trail. We didn't really miss it as much as I did not understand how the guide book worked and missed the part about turning off the AT to a side trail.2. Get maps! The guide book is great if you are on the trail but no help if you venture off. After missing the shelter and having no tent, we decided to go ahead and climb Clingmans Dome. It got dark on the way up so we donned our headlamps and pushed forward. The wind was unbelievable at the top but the nighttime view was amazing! We (Landon) decided to push to the next shelter and hope there was space. Well we ended up descending the Dome for a long time before we realized the trail was not the AT. I guess you could say we climbed the Dome twice. I think that all of our mishaps could have been solved easily with a set of maps. I will have maps before I hit the AT again.We got back to our car eventually and had a great time overall. Landon did not get discouraged even tough the plan fell thru. That is the most important thing to me. Lessons learned and moving forward with our plan.",,Clingmans Dome,"Jan 07, Thu",0
