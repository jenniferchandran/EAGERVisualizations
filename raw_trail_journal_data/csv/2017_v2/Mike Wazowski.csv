Mike Wazowski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513576,"In 2002, I attempted to hike the AT. Had it all planned like a military campaign. But there was just one small problem.A number of years prior, 1998, I lost my left eye in an accident. So, 3D vision was a problem...Do you know that small 3 step bridge on the approach trail? Well, I misjudged the height, toppled of the bridge, and got a concussion. :-(   I got off the trail for a few weeks, tried again, but dizziness problems caused me to stop for good.So, 13 years later, after getting divorced, getting re-married, surviving cancer, gaining weight (oh boy), I've decided to try it again. Maybe not the whole thing at once, probably section hikes. More of a personal goal to take care of myself. Never quit I guess.... Please wish me well.

Mike Wazowski,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519315,"Hi folks, Mikey here. 3 weeks ago I fell down again while training at school, I sprained my ankle, twisted my knee, and fell flat on my face. After seeing stars for a few minutes, I made it to the school nurse, who called my wife to take me home. I stayed the night in the hospital. CAT scans showed that I had no concussion, but an MRI did show that I now have a herniated disk in my lumber region of the back. X-rays showed a cracked bone in my foot.Since my last post I have lost 7 pounds though. Stay focused on the bright side!","0
