Lyn - Wildflower,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579000,"Last May I introduced my good friend, Jackie, to the GA AT. Her inaugural three-day, two-night, 24-mile hike included 20.2 miles from Neels Gap to Unicoi Gap and an additional 4.3 mile day-hike up Blood Mountain (to the summit and back via Byron Reece Trailhead). Jackie had never back-packed, but I knew she could probably handle any part of the trail I threw her way. She is extremely fit, so we were not worried about her ability to slay the PUD’s of the GA AT, however she WAS nervous about the camping part… sleeping outside and all of those night sounds! The unknown was (and always is) the weather, but we were prepared, and Jackie was pumped … a really good sign! (Always a tricky thing to assume your friends will become as trail-passionate as you!) 
Between my extra gear and my husband’s gear, we furnished Jackie with all she would need, even down to her own Sawyer water filter and pocket rocket stove. This would be a huge learning experience for her, and she wanted to know and do it ALL herself, i.e., setting up tent, filtering water, cooking food, sorting through personal hygiene, etc.

In preparation (prior to the hike), Jackie and I met several times - once to show her the gear list and explain gear items, and the next to actually show her the gear and how it is used. Next, she received a tutorial in trail food, which I tried to make exciting. Also, I had given Jackie a link to several AT journals to read, so that she could learn from someone else’s perspective. We would not be carrying much food, so our packs were around 23# each. 
Fortunately, the weather remained great the entire three days of our hike, so the views from both Cowrock and Blood Mountain were fabulous. Another bonus for Jackie and which injected even more fun into our hike was meeting so many great people along the trail. Even though we only covered 24 miles, Jackie (and I) talked to just about everyone we passed or met along the way. We even received trail magic on top of Cowrock Mountain in the form of chocolates and cheese!

So, when the hike was said and done, the highlights were many, the low-lights few. More importantly, Jackie was now extremely eager to return to the trail! Yay! Success!! Another backpacking convert!!! During the long drive back to southern MS I convinced her that she needed to see more of my favorite places further north along the AT, beginning with the balds around Roan Mt., TN. So, in a few weeks Jackie and I are hitting the trail once more, this time hiking 50.9 miles northbound on the AT, from Erwin (River Road, Unaka Springs Rd) to 19E (Mountain Harbor Hostel). The big bonus for us both … hiking through autumn! So excited!!!","

Lyn - Wildflower,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579727,"For the entire month of September I traveled to Tampa to visit my 94 yr-old mother-in-law, (“Mom”) who lives in a seventh-floor apartment, which is housed within a very large, independent living complex. Mom has lived here eighteen years. I love Mom for so many reasons, but one of the most surprising of them all is that she has been one of my greatest hiking cheerleaders! When I first mentioned my love of the trail to her ten years ago, she never once questioned my sanity … At least, if she did, she kept it to herself! Five years ago, just a few months before setting out on my AT thru-hike, I stayed with Mom for two weeks as she was recuperating from a fractured hip. At the age of 89, her determination to walk unassisted again was astounding! She would say to me (as she winced under rigorous therapy), “If you can hike 2200 miles, I can walk again!” And she did! Her brilliant blue eyes would twinkle when I would describe my hiking plans! She was so enthusiastic about my AT adventure that she wanted to learn everything she possibly could to soak up anything related to the AT. She read several of the AT books I recommended, so that she would better understand the lure of the trail. She followed my on-line journal and told any of her friends (who would listen) about her daughter in-law who was hiking from Georgia to Maine. Yes, thanks to Mom I had VIP status with her friends! 
Unfortunately, Mom has since had several more falls, the latest and most severe being three months ago, and the result was several fractured vertebrae. Fortunately, after intense therapy and determination, she is now able to walk once more (with the aid of a walker). But walk she does! Mom is my heroic, hiking inspiration! (Also ... we survived hurricane Irma together!!!)","

Lyn - Wildflower,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580052,"The nine-hour drive from my home in MS to Roan Mountain, TN, was (blissfully) uneventful. This all changed, however, as we entered the small town of Roan Mountain and immediately saw emergency vehicles parked up and down US 19, assisting with what appeared to be flash-flooding along the Doe River. US 19 was not under water, but the side streets that crossed the river were! http://www.elizabethton.com/2017/10/24/cleanup-repairs-continue-after-flooding-in-roan-mountain/ As we made our way to Mountain Harbor B&B and Hostel, where we had a reservation for the night, my mind immediately went to the hikers who must have been affected by today's hard rains ...Ugh! This was my first visit to Mountain Harbor, because I was not able to stop during my thru-hike, and I wanted Jackie to enjoy another hostel experience. Mountain Harbor has gained wide acclaim for its delicious food, especially breakfast, and this year they added a large food truck - which would better accommodate hungry hikers who walk the .3 mi from the trail to the Mountain Harbor grounds. As we entered the driveway we immediately noticed the very swollen creek that runs between the main house (B&B) and hostel; we also noticed a man and woman standing upstream in the water, the man shoveling dirt around the creek. (This could not possibly have been enjoyable - the air temps were only low 50's and the stream water even colder. We later learned that David and Shannon - proprietors of Mountain Harbor - were trying to divert the flow of the raging, rising stream away from the near-by hostel / barn. [See photo] His hard shoveling efforts paid off, because water never reached the barn.)After settling into the barn / hostel Jackie and I began meeting the hikers who had already found refuge there from the earlier storm. The word ""miserable"" was heard repeatedly, and the weather front would usher in clear weather for tomorrow but potentially sub-freezing temps for the next three nights. We will be hauling winter gear, but I hope Jackie remains my friend if the frigid air becomes a mental challenge. Sub-freezing temps will definitely be a first for her! I need to remember that we are here to have fun - the hike plan can always be adjusted! As Benton MacKaye envisioned, ""The AT is a place to walk, to see ... and to 'see' what you see."" Can't wait to see what we see! Tomorrow we hike!!!",,View Entry,"Oct 23, Mon",0
Lyn - Wildflower,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580081,"I fell asleep last night to the loud gurgling of the near-by creek - nature’s sound machine! This morning the water level had gone down considerably, which I’m sure was a great relief to the Mountain Harbor folks. Jackie and I packed up for our hike and made our way to the main house for our much-anticipated breakfast buffet. When we saw the menu offerings I needed to go no further than David’s home-made strudel (pastries are my weakness!) but quickly found my plate full of egg casserole, breakfast potatoes, biscuits, fresh fruit, blueberry pancakes, and so much more! Jackie was extremely happy, too! Yes, this was definitely a stellar start to a long day of hiking!
We were on the Mountain Harbor shuttle by 9am, and an hour later were dropped off at the Erwin trailhead to begin our NOBO hike back to Mountain Harbor hostel, 51 trail-miles away. The morning temps were perfect for hiking (mid-forties), and the blue skies promised happy hiking. Our planned campsite was 12.7 miles away. The trail was just as I remembered, well-maintained and soft from both old and newly-fallen leaves. We followed a lovely stream for over a mile, after which we faced a moderately tough climb of 1,000 ft. in 1.5 mi., after which we paused for water. The peek-a-boo views of autumn-colored mountains in the distance took my breath away. My favorite colors along the trail today were the maple reds, not very plentiful, so when I saw them it was reason enough to pause. (See photo) 
At mile six we stopped for lunch at a bend in the trail, beside a beautiful stream. (After all the miles hiked in previous years, it’s amazing to me that I still love peanut butter!) Honestly, today has been a “pinch me” kind of wonderful hiking day … mid-afternoon we began walking up the beautiful grassy bald, Beauty Spot. These balds and the views they command on clear days are part of the reason these fifty miles of our hike are my favorite AT miles (south of New Hampshire). 
The day was waning as we finally made our way across the gravel USFS 230 which runs beside our chosen campsite. The air temps were colder as we filled our water bottles at the piped stream. To make matters worse, the wind was gusting hard, and we both used rocks to hold down our tents as they were assembled. (I was using my husband’s 2-person BA Copper Spur, and Jackie was using my BA Fly Creek SL1 Plat; she won the race in getting the tents up … I might have put my tent up backwards to start with… Sigh.) I hung the bear bag rope for our food bags before darkness set in, and we were able to get our stoves lit, despite the winds - for dinner and hot chocolate. To avoid the now frigid winds we made the decision to eat dinner in my larger tent. This is when Jackie let me know that, as wonderful as today’s hike has been, she does NOT want to camp tomorrow night, especially knowing the temps will be even colder. (Hmmm, maybe it’s time to go to “plan B” to keep it fun.) I told her what I was thinking … that I would call Mountain Harbor for a shuttle pick-up tomorrow at Iron Mountain Gap, TN 107/NC 226, eight miles away. We would stay at the hostel tomorrow night. She happily agreed, and I made the call. David told me that he was already scheduled to be at Iron Mountain Gap at 1pm to pick up another hiker, so I told him that we would be there, too. Tomorrow we will rise early to hike the near-by, towering Unaka Mountain (5,200 ft) and walk through its deep, forest of evergreens and mosses. One more example of why I love this AT section! All in all, eight hiking miles to meet tomorrow's shuttle. Tonight my sound machine is the howling wind! I love this hike!","Erwin, TN; River Rd/Unaka Springs Rd.
","Camp Site, Mile 354.2","Oct 24, Tue",12.70
Lyn - Wildflower,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580195,"Last night I heard vehicles using the forest service road near our camp site (about 75 yards away) until around midnight, followed by a search and rescue helicopter which flew over twice. (We are currently hiking in the Cherokee National Forest and the Unaka Mountain Wilderness, a stunning and vast area designated by Congress in1986. Of course, it is managed by the Forest Service, so maybe the helicopters were forest service personnel making sure there were no errant fires on this extremely windy night.) I was relieved to learn that Jackie slept well. 
The wind of last night was gone, but the cold was still bone-chilling, making it hard to move, even after coffee! The heavy fog was a surprise - but I was excited … We were about to hike (up) one of my favorite mountains in the southern AT chain (Unaka Mt., elev. 5,180 ft); we were on our way by 7:45 and climbing immediately - 1,045ft in 1.5 mi to the summit.The trail was beautiful in the clouds, and the switchbacks I remembered from five years ago contributed to the fun embrace of Unaka’s summit trek. Just before we reached the thick evergreen, mossy forest for which Unaka is famous, I saw something to the left of the trail which was a huge surprise - a large evergreen decked in Christmas ball ornaments, with solar lights at ground level. (See photo.) I have learned that surprises are (potentially) around every turn of the trail, but this sight was very special; someone had gone to a lot of effort for this trail delight, and it warmed my heart on this cold, sunless morning. (Post-hike note: I later learned that the decorated tree was in memory of a young man who passed away at the age of 22 - and whose family thought this beautiful tree a fitting tribute.) A few steps further and we were walking through the summit’s dense forest of evergreens on a thick, pine-needle carpeted trail. This was so different from the trail of yesterday, and Jackie loved it - immediately getting why I wanted her to experience Unaka. Since we had a 1pm shuttle to meet we did not linger here as we both would have liked and started the downhill toward Iron Mountain Gap, now less than seven miles away.
Last night Jackie mentioned that, because of family issues, she might need to get home a day early. This meant that we would have to cut our hike short. Since we were already planning to leave the trail early today, I knew that we would probably not be able to hike Roan Mountain tomorrow. Now I needed to think about a “plan C” in order for her to still see the balds of Roan Mountain, i.e., Round Bald, Jane Bald, Little Hump, and Hump Mountain. As we hiked the rest of the morning I thought about it all, realizing the miles we missed would be there for another time. (Just keep it fun!) We stopped for a late breakfast after another hour, and I devoured the cooked oatmeal I had prepared early this morning before breaking camp (and left uneaten in its zip-lock.) By 12:35 we had reached Iron Mountain Gap, where we met Wes and his dog, the other shuttle rider David would be picking up to deliver back to Mountain Harbor. Shannon arrived (instead of David) and asked if we wanted to stay in the B&B tonight (instead of the hostel). After hearing the words “breakfast included” in the room package deal, we accepted her offer and soon found ourselves in the lap of AT luxury. Yes, Plan B was definitely going to be fun, and Jackie was wholeheartedly embracing my “gotta stay flexible” motto of hiking!","Campsite, Mile 354.2
",Iron Mountain Gap,"Oct 25, Wed",7.90
Lyn - Wildflower,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580206,"Yesterday afternoon, once secluded in our lovely Mountain Harbor B&B room, we rested (and savored the warm central heat and numerous cups of hot tea!) Jackie confirmed that she needs to be home Friday, thus cutting a day of hiking from our original plan. Last night, over a delicious dinner of Packit Gourmet Pasta Beef Bolognese, we agreed on our alternate hiking “plan C” - to drive our car to Carver’s Gap after breakfast (9 a.m.) in the morning and day-hike Round Bald and Jane Bald, picnic atop Jane Bald, then hike back to Carver’s Gap and begin the long journey home. We would not have time to hike Little Hump or Hump Mt., but they would be there for another day. 

The dreary skies of yesterday were replaced with bright sunshine, which began its task of melting the ice on the windshield of Jackie’s car. Even though the morning temps were still below freezing, we knew the clear, blue morning sky would give us stunning, 360-degree vistas from the balds, and I could not wait for Jackie to see them! The only problem was that …Jackie’s car did not start when we were finally ready to go. Jackie said, “My car has never been this cold!” Yep - dead battery! Eric, who helps David and Shannon in the mornings around the hostel and B&B, was most helpful in getting us jumped off, so that we could make it to the small, near-by town of Roan Mountain for a new battery. We found a NAPA auto parts store and (more importantly), the most helpful mechanic had just the battery Jackie’s car needed. While he replaced the battery we talked with him about the Monday flash-floods, and he told us that the big flood of 1998 was much worse: ""A powerful winter storm brought widespread flooding to East Tennessee (TN) and western North Carolina (NC) overnight from January 7th through 8th, 1998. The hardest hit area was in the rugged Appalachian mountains of Carter County TN, where seven people lost their lives. Over 200 mobile homes and 15 houses were demolished; 193 other houses or structures and 6 businesses were damaged. The flood occurred along the upper Doe River, with the communities of Roan Mountain, Hampton, and Valley Forge afflicted. A preliminary estimate of loss was put at $20 million."" (National Weather Service)

We were on our way to Carver’s Gap (along TN 143) by 10am and hiking up Round Bald (elev. 5,826 ft) by 10:45. The skies were crystal clear, and we stopped constantly to take pictures and embrace the beauty of earth meeting sky. After one particular photo-op Jackie was finally given a trail name! (She has refused my previous naming attempts on her behalf, declining such character/trail descriptive names like “Songbird” and “Walky-Talky”…) This name was given to her after I refused to let her carry my pack up Jane Bald, but she took it away, saying that it was “her turn”. (We had condensed our lunch and day-hike essentials into my ZPack, which I had told her that I would carry.) We stood by the trail for five minutes arguing about who should carry the pack! (There might have been some grabbing and pushing for control of the pack!) We started laughing, and I said that we were fighting just like sisters, and that’s when it hit me! I said, “Your trail name is SISTER, because we're acting just like sisters!” She loved it and said, “Sister (with) Spirit - but, ok, ‘Sister’ for short!” Jackie (Sister) and I laughed when she added, “And … I don’t think you should be ‘Wildflower’ anymore; you’re more like a ‘Wild cat!’” I emphatically denied the change but Jackie (Sister) wouldn’t let it go. So fun! We spread our lunch out and rested atop Jane Bald (elev. 5,800 ft). As Jackie (Sister) gazed out over the mountains and wilderness in the vast distance below she said, “I feel so blessed to be in this place.” 

By 2 pm we were driving toward home. I asked Jackie what her highs and lows of our short hike had been. Her favorite places were the balds we hiked this morning, but a close second was Unaka Mountain. The “low” occurred Tuesday night - as we prepped and set up camp in the freezing, windy air. “But”, she said, …. “I’m glad I went through that! I think I would like to hike some of the AT in every state!” I mentioned the “4-State challenge” : Hiking forty + miles in 24-hrs, starting just inside the Virginia side of the Virginia - West Virginia line, then hiking the short mileage through West Virginia through Harpers Ferry, then Maryland and ending after crossing the Pennsylvania border). My amazing hiking partner didn’t balk but stated one important condition: “We’ll just have to make sure the weather is WARM!”","Carver's Gap
