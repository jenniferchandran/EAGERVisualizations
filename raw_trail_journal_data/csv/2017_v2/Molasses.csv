A section of the trail went thru a BIG rock field that was a scramble to hike thru. Other than that I made good so at Flint shelter (Picture below) I only stopped for lunch and kept hiking. Because of the continuing rain the shelter was full. Today On the trail was a stone marker with the name of a thru hiker that hiked the AT in 1968.

Rain forecast for tonight which will make for a difficult trek off this mountain. The other day I saw a 5 ft black snake on the trail and today I heard several woodpeckers high in trees. Also thought I heard people talking a couple times but was only trees high above rubbing against each other in the wind. Great view atop another hill. Met there a couple from Germany.

When about finished a trail angle, young woman, walked into shelter with sodas, chips and cookies. All hikers at shelter and myself had their fill. On Round Bald and Jane's Bald the wind was blowing hard with rain and some sleet and gusting to 70 mph, my estimate. Wind almost knocked me down several times. The blowing sleet was stinging my skin thru my shirt and rain jacket. Left leg was hurting but determined it was not joint or ligament but muscle I probably pulled hiking up Roan Mountain. Now only 4:00pm and I may have another ramen or just snacks. Hikers are still arriving. Now there are about 15 to 20 hikers here. About half here are female.

The blew me off the trail several times but managed to stay on my feet. After plateauing Hump mtn it was down hill to Elk Park NC where I tented at the Mountain Harbor Hostel, all beds were filled in hostel. I got my clothes washed, they needed it, and a shower and I needed it too. I set my battery, iPhone and Apple Watch to charge. Only was watch got fully charged. I have battery charging overnight. Five of us rented a shuttle for a trip into town for one of Bobs famous burgers. It was delicious after only eaten ramen, tuna pkts and cliff bars sine leaving Erwin TN. I'll leave out in the morning for a hike to Damascus VA 75 miles distance. I have enough groceries for 7 days but hope to arrive sooner.

I rested 2.5 hours at Mountainaire Shelter where I collected water had dinner. Warm day with little breeze but generally easier terrain with exception of day start. I walked a short detour to Jones Falls which was worth the effort and where I had lunch. Docks and his wife Pharmgirl there for snack. He is a boat dock builder on lake Gasten in NC and she is a pharmacist hence their trail Names. A $12 breakfast was served at the Hostel which I passed on and had Brevita crackers instead. Before I left tent I had to tend to some feet blisters and abrasions on my hips caused by pack. I was very attempted to stay at Mountainaire S. but had only completed 8.8 miles at that point and opted to walk two more hours. Glad I pressed on as I had the energy after dinner of Ramen complimented with bits of jerky I bought in Castroville TX. For lunch I had a tuna packet and a box of raisins for fiber. Also at my campsite was Dave from Richmond VA whom was on a week hike without sons and Boy Scout troop he leads. Dave is a Baptist Missionary recently returned from Ukraine. Pack is heavy after resupply at Elk Park NC. Its now 9:00 p and I'm tired. I'll catch up on journal when I get a signal, probably in Damascus VA in about 5 days.

Weather today was cool and breezy and hike was not difficult. Couple of hills otherwise mostly just short ups and lots of downs. Had breakfast cereal bar and for lunch had tuna pkt at Moreland Gap shelter and was back on trail by 11:30. At about 12:30 I came upon a 20 year old German girl named Jacquline that had passed me earlier setting by the trail. She was in tears due to some bad hiking experience: 1). On her first day about 4 days ago she lost her phone while hiking southbound. So she backtracked looking for phone and was advised by another hiker that it was picked up by a Northbounder. So she continued north until she came to the Overmountain Shelter where she recovered her phone. That day, her first day, she hiked 24 miles over some strenuous trail thru some treacherous weather: wind, rain, cold. Her feet became severely blistered. 2). Separately She lost her ID and $240. The items were found and mailed to her USA address. 3). This morning while in her tent her bear spray went off in her face and upper body. Fortunately Jimmychagra was near and helped her recover. So when I found her by the trail she had given up on continuing her hike. We hiked together for several miles to the hostel I am at tonight. It helped her spirits. She called a friend whom picked her up and took her home to the family where she works as an AUPAIR. My hip abrasions are tender. I've made a pack adjustment; hope it helps. Weather is cold and wet for next several days and will make for tuff hiking. Especially since I start the hike with a 1,600 foot climb over a 2.9 mile distance and then down the same. At this Hostel I picked up a few essentials, had a hot shower and ate a pizza sold at hostel. I took some time after dinner to organize my stuff.

Six hikers were spread out in this 8 person shelter. I squeezed in to make it 7. False summit: when I've been hiking uphill for a while and think I'm at top, I make a turn and there is still more hill ahead equals false summit. Sometimes there is more than one false summit. On a hill climb, when I look up the trail and can see daylight through the trees I'm expecting to summit soon. I have an altimeter on my iwatch, it helps me manage my expectations.

It's raining now after a short reprieve. About 5 hikers have arrived this shelter since 6:50p. They are wet. Today I picked some ramps (a wild onion/garlic plant). I intended to cook in my ramen dinner but it did not work out due to inclement conditions. BTW, shortly after leaving Damascus yesterday I reached 200 miles in this hike. Today, between rain showers, I sent a grocery list to Peggy so that she can fill and mail to Marion VA, my next town layover about four days from now. I did see a herd of about 8 wild horses the Grayson Highlands is known for. Rain is suppose to let up tomorrow. We'll see. It's now 7:30p and raining hard.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Molasses,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564893,"11.9 miles from Thomas Knob Shelter to Old Orchard Shelter. Rain last night made for a very sloppy trail. No rain today though big part of morning I did hike in the clouds. Not long after leaving TKS at 7:30a I entered an area called the Grayson Highlands. One attraction of the Grayson Highlands are the ponies that inhabit this area. Although wild, they have seen a lot of hikers pass through their area and are rather indifferent. They will allow you to approach them as they are curious, friendly and tame. During the course of transversing the GH I saw at least 45 ponies , several very young colts and several mares close to dropping their offspring. Seeing the ponies was the days highlight. Clouds most of day, started clearing in afternoon and never got very warm. I crossed paths with Rocket, his Daughter SheHulk and her boyfriend CrazyPants from Japan. Upon our arrival together at TKS, the three of them elected to hike to the next shelter 4.2 mikes further north up the trail. I was done for the day. Yesterday was tough hiking, Mt Rogers at 5,080 ft, where the TKS was located and the ensuing rain were a tough combination. It's now 7:50p.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Couple of hills, one early with fresh legs and cool air and one hill later when warmer and not so fresh legs. SMELLS: reaching Pine tree elevation delivers the fresh and pleasant scent of pine; crossing a pasture with ponies or a cow herd present is accompanied by the barnyard aroma that I've known before; hikers have a smell that for the most part is tolerable, however the aroma from some people's feet would curl your nose hairs; mostly the air while hiking is fresh and pleasant(depending on the climate, rain or sunshine or morning, the fresh and pleasant aroma has subtle changes); day hikers smell like personal hygiene products. Today when I arrived at TS one of the first things I did was collect water, wipe the sweat off my upper body with a wet bandanna and then rinse the shirt I hiked in. I hope it drys by morning. This shelter is built of stone and even has a stone fireplace. Sleeps 10. Its full. After my dinner of Lipton soup, hot chocolate and Almond Joy I played a game of chess. TraiMix asked if any played chess and when none spoke up I did, we played and I won. I think he is a better player however. TrailMx are having a discussion of 1st and 2nd John. I listened in.

From the Marion Visitor Center, .2 mile from PS, I then hitched into Marion VA. Ride came quick from local guitar maker named Ike that dropped me off at the Travel Inn where I am now. After arrival I took a nice hot shower then took the Marion Metro Transit to the PO where I claimed a package of food that I had requested filled from Peggy and then to KFC downtown. The same same Metro picked me up at KFC(each ride was 50 cents) and delivered me back to the Travel Inn. I caught up with friends and family texts and email and Facebook. The hike today was very pleasant with mostly level ground accented with a few very manageable climbs. SOUNDS: My footfalls of course and the clanking of my trekking poles on rocks and the the soft sound of them picking up leaves. Rushing water from streams and cascading down steep slopes. Winds rustling tree leaves and limbs and the occasional screech of limbs rubbing on each other. The rubbing sounds sometimes sound like voices in the distance and cause me momentarily to look around. Crows cawing in the distance, a couple of excited geese taking flight and doves cooing to each other. Sometimes dogs barking in the distance and once coyotes yelping at night as they will do. Owls hooting at night. Woodpeckers tapping away and not seen. Traffic is seldom heard unless the trail runs close to or across local roads. The cows did not moo and the ponies did not sound beyond what I could here as they grazed. Conversations with both northbounders and southbounders are short pleasantries of happy hiking. Tomorrow is a ZERO day. A rest day and time to wash clothes and organize my food pantry and study of the trail map for upcoming camp/shelter sites, terrain challenges and next provision town are businesses of the day. Today marks 257 trail miles since April 20 with about 190 miles to Daleville, my end objective. Thank you to all for your comments and good wishes, questions and support.

I laid there for awhile and when I got up I started preparing for tomorrow's hike. The first order of business was washing two loads of clothes, two loads not because I have so many clothes but because of the different fabric requirements. After wash I walked to a nearby Walmart for a canister of fuel for my camp stove and a travel size antibacterial hand cleaner. For breakfast I was seeking bacon and eggs but ended up at McDonalds and their big breakfast of pancakes, sausage patty, potato patty, scrambled eggs, coffee and orange juice. I was not disappointed. After a short walk back to the Travel Inn I sorted and organized the food items Peggy had mailed to me here in Marion. I have 6 days stock that I can stretch to 7. If not reprovisioned by day 8 I'll have to eat tree bark. I took time to clean my camel bladder, three other water containers and my cooking ware. I called Peggy, mom and my friend Jazz. For dinner I took a $4 cab downtown to Wolfs BBQ restaurant which had been recommended to me about a hundred miles ago by TJ and Caitlin. I thoroughly enjoyed a half pound of brisket(ordered with lots of marble and the bark), pinto beans, coleslaw, cornbread and a Coca Cola. An extra treat at the restaurant was a 5 piece string band whose music type escapes me. I'll think of it tomorrow. It's now 9:55p. My back is packed ( it's heavy with a full stock of food and 70 ozs of water).

This morning I intended to take the Marion Metro Transit from Walmart at 8:30a  to the trailhead. Myself and another hiker, Justin, in the right place at the right time but unfortunately missed the the 50 cent Transit and instead took a cab for $9 each. Therefore we got a later start by about 40 minutes whose only consequence was the fare and hot air. It was hot today. There were several intense climbs and a million rocks. More hikers than not where shoes known as trail runners. These are a low quarter shoe that's lighter than my boot with a less substantial sole. More than one I've talked to with the trail runners are suffering with sore feet, especially because of the rocks and roots. I've not had sore feet but I am careful about my footfalls. Thanks to the resupply box I received from Peggy, I'll enjoy better nutrition and more energy. Lots of flowering plants and bushes. The Rhododendrons are in full bloom with their predominantly pink flowers. Some blooms are white or darker pinks. I was pretty exhausted by the time I reached a hotel in Atkins VA where I had made reservation. Tonight I went to a local restaurant had had a juicy hamburger, tater tots and three glasses of Dr Pepper. I'm satisfied. From the trail today I heard a train and it's horn down in the valley. A SOUND I did not mention in a previous post. Nice to hear. I briefly visited a 'Settlers Museum'. Mildly interesting. But there was Trail magic there from which I drank a can of cold Ginger Ale. Nice. It's now 9:00pm.","Marion VA

Started early to beat the heat. Cool morning but it did not last long. High today was 89 degrees. Combined with three rather intense climbs made for a long day. One of the most enjoyable aspects of today's was seeing the Rhododendrons which are in full bloom with their mostly pink flowers. There were thousands of pink blooms that I saw along the trail. Thousands! Due to the great resupply box I received from Peggy I did have more energy with the food I consumed. Smoked sausage and a brownie for breakfast, dried fruit trail mix for snacks. Tuna pkt for lunch today but with mayo and relish. Dinner was spam I cooked with cheese and mustard between two toasted tortillas. For desert I mixed a pkt of Justin's Peanut butter mixed with honey that I scooped up with Belvita Crackers. Tasty. Rain is forecasted for the night so I was surprised when only one other hiker and myself shared this 8 person shelter. It's still hot laying here in my sleeping bag liner. Too hot yet to pull up my sleeping bag. When I arrived Shelter I was out of water so first order of business was water collection from a slow running spring about 1/10 mile downhill. The distance felt like 2/10 coming back with my 4 liter water reservoir. I used a portion of the water to wipe the sweat off my upper body and to rinse my shirt. I drank two quarts and had enough to fill my 70 oz camel bladder. During my hike I drank 86 oz and could have drank more but ran out of water about a mile from shelter. Shared dinner table with Chicken(from England), Romeo from Maryland and another dude whose name I did not catch. Today on the trail I was passed by several hikers including a 7 member group known as 'The Crew', a family of 5 children and parents. He's know as Daddyo.

Today had two significant climbs: one was 600 ft elevation over one mile and the other was a monster climb with elevation of 2,000 feet over 4.5 miles which ended at CKS. The last two miles I was racing a cold, windy rain to the Shelter. I won. However the downpour I expected never materialized and even though I arrived early at 2pm, I decided to stick with my itinerary and stay. It's now mostly clear skies. CKS is a 6 person shelter with 5 so far attending. The only hiker name I know is HIKINGHOME. She's a thru hiker and lives in Maine. A Knob is a barren hill and CKSis at the top with a great view of the valley below. The shelter is built of rock and is fully enclosed. Even the picnic table is inside. Shelters have a string attached to rafters. About half way down the two foot string is a barrier designed to discourage mice from attacking the pack which is secured by a stick tied to end of string. Pretty simple design but effective. Several hikers arrived after me but either moved on or are tenting nearby. About a mile and a half before CKS I refilled my camel bladder and two other reservoirs, one 16 oz, the other 2 liters. I put these two in my cargo pockets. It was a lot to carry but plenty for preparing my ramen with chicken dinner, hot chocolate, cleaning dishes and brushing teeth. I also had lunch in the shelter. The trail has been fairly slim of AT hikers because this weekend is the annual 'Trail Days' event held in Damascus. When the mass of hikers leave Damascus a 'bubble' will occur. That will make tent and shelter space more crowded. The 'bubble' will catch me but not for a few days. Eventually the mass will spread out through the trail. Today I did meet two hiking together, DIRTYJ (from Southern CA) and RAINBOW (from Nashville). They are young, they met on the trail. It's now 8:10pm.","Knot Mail Branch Shelter

Thunder, lightning and rain about 1am but I woke up to a beautiful, mostly clear morning. The valley below was covered in clouds that hung just above the valley. A pretty sight from the shelter. Started hike at 7:25a, a little later than I preferred. The trail started with a decrease in elevation from CKS at 4,393 ft to 3,520 ft where it stayed 6 miles until I was about 4 miles from JS where the elevation dropped down 2,400 ft. Lots of downhill which for me and most others is hard on the knees. Around noon, when I stopped for lunch, I was treated to an ice cold sprite and a camel bladder fill up. Today got warm at 75degrees. My camel did not have enough water to reach camp so I was very happy with the trail magic! The 'level' section of the trail was like a roller coaster with a lot of short ups and downs. Elevation hovered around 3,500 during rollercoaster. I reached JS about 3:30p. Only myself and Bambi are staying in Shelter. There are about 4 tents nearby. For dinner I thoroughly enjoyed a spam and cheese quesadilla and hot chocolate. There are lots of bees here. Concerned that I might get stung. At JS I collected 4 liters of stream, not spring, water. Although treated with my AquaMira drops I'm not totally comfortable with its consumption so I only drank what I boiled for my hot chocolate and passed through my Sawyer filter which is attached to my camel bladder. Since there is not much water between here and next Shelter, I will carry an extra container of 16 ozs that I can refill my camel with if necessary. BTW, I have now hiked 303 trail miles with about 145 to go to Daleville VA. It's now 7:30p and still 72 degrees.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Elevation up hill was not outrageous but the rocks on trail were contrary. Rocks were prevalent for much of the hike and almost as hazardous as the black slippery mud. Rain had flooded the trail in many areas. Rocks, rain, slickery mud and a swamped trail all made for slow going. At mountain top and n a long ridge, the cold, windy rain was enough for me to stop and put on the Marmot. Nevertheless I managed to cover the distance in 6 hours and arrive Hotel at 2:30pm. I'm staying here two nights, tomorrow is a zero day. Good thing. Been raining consistently sent my arrival. After a long set in the hot tub and showering rinse I shaved, dressed and in the rain walked across the street to a Mexican food restaurant. Enjoyable and filling but it's not San Antonio TexMex.

Two tough uphill climbs and a long ridge that all have agreed was difficult to hike over. The ridge had a very narrow top and the trail traversed huge rock slabs about 10 to 15 feet from top to bottom and on about a 30 degree camber. Imagine walking on a sidewalk for about 400 yards and that is not level but instead sloped at about 20 to 30 degrees. So glad it did not rain, the slabs were dry and therefore not slippery. Hike start invoked two swollen stream crossings. The swollen stream reduced the number of rock hopping choices as many rocks under normal stream level conditions would not have been under water. Scary to cross, especially for short people. One of the hikers reported seeing a rattle snake. He estimated snake at four feet and apparently in process of digesting an engorged meal. I collected water three times today. First from BATMAN that had a gallon in his car. He is supporting the hike of his wife BLACKBEAR and her friend SHORTCAKE. Next collection was from a spring several miles down the trail. By the time I got to spring my camel bladder was empty and I was rationing my 16 oz reserve. Last water collection was from stream near NS. Much of this water was used to rinse my hiking shirt and bandanna that I used to sponge off my upper body. I did hike for a period of time with PEREGRINE ( a 24 year old civil engineer from Harpers Ferry) and his friend MEGHAN whom I gathered was a teacher(bright and talkative).

Soon after leaving NS the trail ascended 1,500 ft over a distance of 3 miles. That was a difficult climb but not the most challenging for the day. At 15 miles into the hike I maneuvered ever so slowly through what is know as the 'Dragons Tooth'. The descent through the giant stone formations was treacherous. Handholds and steel steps were necessary to keep from going head over heels. The trail got easier after Dragons Tooth but just barely. At this point, about 2 miles from my destination, there were many stone steps and steep vertical rock formations. All of this was late in the day when I was most tired. I'm glad to report that I successfully negotiated these difficult obstacles. The price of admission to sleep at FPH is on a donation basis. I 'donated' $10 for which Joe Wilson, the owner, said if all hikers donated $10 he would be rich. I would estimate number of hikers here tonight at about 20. For sleeping there are cots and four sofas, one of which I will sleep on in my sleeping bag. Many are tenting. It was nice to have a shower and put on clean clothes. The hiking clothes I changed out of were, let's say, due for a good washing which I will try to get done in Daleville VA which is 26 miles distance from here.

I took some time to visit his memorial which is about 100 yards on a side trail. Moving experience.","Niday Shelter

Molasses,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566966,"10.4 miles from Four Pines Shelter to Campbell Shelter. Late start at 9:00a due to low mileage. Arrived CS at 3:50p. I thought seriously about pushing on the next shelter 6 miles north. St 1.5 mph I would not have arrived until 8pm so I elected to stay at CS. Currently only myself and two others are in Shelter. Must be about 7 tents nearby. Today I hiked for awhile with Perigrin and his friend Meghan. We talked for awhile about investment choices. He is a civil engineer and they are both 24. She is a talker. Her conversation is mind numbing. He has the patience of a saint listening to her drone on and on. The highlight of the day was Mcafee Knob which is the most photographed spot on the AT. The appeal of Mcafee is a huge rock that protrudes to a point from the side of the mountain. The view of the Appalachian Mountains is grand. The drop down from the point is forever. Because of my fear of heights I did not venture to the point. Others did. Even that gave me the willies. Campbell Shelter is 15.4 miles from Daleville. Decision tomorrow is do I push it to Daleville or camp between here and there. Perigren and Meghan just walked up and are also staying in Shelter. She's talking. After I arrived at CS and after I made decision to stay I collected four liters of water. I boiled enough to prepare a Mountain House beef stroganoff dinner and shave. Hot chocolate and honey that Peggy mailed were desert. TREE, a hiker in the Shelter is sketchy. I think he is homeless. TREE took another hikers shoes this morning that he thought had been abandoned beside the 'hiker box'. The 'hiker box' is a box where hikers leave things they no longer need or want or want to carry. The rightful owner reclaimed them. TREE has a dog named Annie. I'm glad others have arrived. It's raining. Just started. Going to be an interesting night. It's now 9:00p.","Four Pines Hostel

Molasses,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567135,"16.1 miles from Campbell Shelter to Howard Johnson Express in Daleville VA. Left CS at 7:30a. A little later than preferred but Shelter was full of sleeping hikers I did not want to disturb. Inasmuch as I wanted to give myself every advantage toward my goal of arriving in Daleville, I had a breakfast packet of banana nut oatmeal and and one of grits. It paid off as it gave me the energy to set a 2 mph pace. I arrived Daleville at 4:00p. 30 minute lunch of tuna pkt and cliff bar. When I studied the AT guide before departure there were no large hills to climb for the day. But, even a little blimp of a hill shown in the guide is still enough to take your breath away...and cause your leg muscles to burn. My endurance however has certainly improved since starting this 454 mile adventure from Hot Springs NC 41 days ago. During this hike I did not suffer from ankle, knee back or shoulder injury. I collected no ticks and had no encounters with poison ivy, spiders or bees or bears. Several others were not as fortunate:  I have first hand knowledge of hikers with the following ailments:  MAPELLEAVES broke her ankle and had to be evacuated from high on the trail; CUMIN stumped his toe once to many times, walked through too much muddy water and got a bad toe infection for which the doctor drained, wrapped and sent on his way with antibiotics; BAMBI spent almost a week at a hostel recovering from ghiordia; LUCKY broke his arm and also had ghiordia; MOUNTAINBEE had an allergic reaction to a bee sting for which he had to see a doctor(he became MountainBee after the sting); CRICKET got hypothermia when it snowed in Smokey Mtn NP and had to be basket lifted by a helicopter, I mentioned JACQULINE in an earlier post, she lost her phone on first day and had to hike 24 miles in rain to recover (feet blistered),  she dropped her money wallet which another hike recovered and mailed to her home, and during one night while sleeping in her tent she accidentally set off her Bear spray...into her face and chest. I only got three non debilitating blisters on my right foot. I prayed every day for this good fortune. After check in at the hotel I had an excellent spaghetti and meatballs dinner. Then off to bed.","Campbell Shelter
