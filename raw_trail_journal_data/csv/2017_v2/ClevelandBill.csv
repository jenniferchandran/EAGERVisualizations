ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552884,"Okay, my name is NOT Ishmael, but my wife thought it would be a good opening line. It seems to have worked elsewhere ...I'm doing the whole mid-life crisis thing. Changing jobs, maybe careers. Ready to do something awesome instead of lucrative. Trying to get back to my youth. OMG, I could go on and on why I'm doing this. You probably feel the same way.I really need a time-out ... a bit of me time. Time to clear out my head and focus on my next moves.I'm probably not going to write often. I don't think I have that much to say ... that anybody would like to hear.Talk soon.",,Couch,"Jan 01, Sun",0
ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552887,"Okay, let's take the ""worst"". 2016 was a rough year for a lot of people. Like David Bowie, Prince, etc. I liked those guys. And a lot of people had a tough time with the election ... but my conscience is clear, I voted for Gary Johnson.I had a great 2016, as did my wife, and our kids are doing fine. Nothing about which to be unhappy. But there is always room for improvement. And there is much to improve, almost all of which is inside my head. And that is what I hope to figure out with some alone time on the AT.",,Bedroom,"Jan 02, Mon",0
ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552894,"I suppose if you're going to write something for others to read, you ought to have something to say. And I think I have a theme. I am going to ...HIKE MY OWN HIKE.And I mean it. There is a survey out there on the web, of recent through-hikers and their equipment. Like one or two people who finished used external frame packs. Well, I'm using one. In defiance of the crowd.But I'm humble enough to realize that I might hit the NOC and decide to get modern. But it sure as heck won't be because of the survey. Or current wisdom (do you know what Grandma Gatewood hiked the trail with?).If our predecessors could do it with full-leather, stitch-down, mountaineering boots ... then we can do it, too. They did it with pre-frame packs. Then with frame packs. Then with internal frame. And full circle back to non-frame ultralight sacks.They didn't have synthetic. They didn't have light. They didn't have GPS.Now, some of my equipment is pretty standard fare, ultralight, modern, etc. But other parts are old school. And you know what they say ... ""There's No School like the Old School"".",,Couch,"Jan 03, Tue",0
ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552941,"Okay. So I am still finalizing my gear choices and the most expensive remaining choice is a Bear Container. I think I'm leaning toward the Garcia container, though the clear one (Bear Vault) makes a good case for itself. (I think that was a pun.).WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?I am not afraid of much, but I think I would be afraid of a bear, a rattlesnake, and that most dangerous of woodland creatures, human beings.In actuality, I think it is the tick that does the most actual damage.So for bears on the AT, a good bear bag system works, long-term, to train bears that we don't have food they can get to. Avoid the bear if you can, but don't show weakness. Scare the hell out of him if you have to.For snakes ... careful stepping to avoid.For scary humans ... For ticks ... DEET on the body and Permethrin on the gear.COMMENTS???",,Chair by Reading Light,"Jan 04, Wed",0
ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553092,"Today's post is a tribute to a very special person, one whom I have never met. Greg Benkert, also known by the trailname Big Red, reminded me of me when I came across his TrailJournals posts in 2002. At that time, I was a stay-at-home dad of a 1-year old boy, and often felt lonely and kinda trapped in our apartment as my baby boy slept days and nights away ...Reading Big Red's journal was inspiring and I really did live vicariously through his travels.I can't remember if this was the start of my AT dreams, or just an enhancement thereof. I know that Big Red was a big man (like me) and worried whether that would hold him back from his goal. It did not. And it will not for me. I'm a little older than he was then, and I have damaged my feet/legs, but I know what he learned ... I will take one step. Then another. Then another.Thank you Big Red, wherever you may be ...",,BIG RED,"Jan 08, Sun",0
ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553186,"The title, above, is a line from Chaucer:""This Nicholas anon leet fle a fart,As greet as it had been a thonder-dent,That with the strook he was almoost yblent""Translated:""This Nicholas just then let fly a fartAs loud as it had been a thunder-clap,And well-nigh blinded Absalom, poor chap""But let me turn the conversation from breaking wind to AT field toiletry.Pooping in the woods is something many people have never done. Many people who have done it have NOT DONE IT CORRECTLY. And by correctly, I mean in compliance with current environmental thinking as expressed in the Leave No Trace principles (LNT).I have lived near Lake Erie my entire life, where freshwater is, truly, limitless. We flush as often as we need. We shower as long as we want. We water our lawns, spray down our driveways, wash our cars ... with no consequence to the freshwater supply.Thus, we can get away with some dumb stuff.I have recently learned that I have been wiping wrong. I use way too much paper. I am one who rolls a little log of paper into a kinda conical shape that fits nicely right up in there to clean things up. But that's like 10 to 12 sheets of two-ply. Then I do it again. And again. Until clean. THEN I shower. LNT calls for a couple sheets of single-ply dissolvable. And afterwards, I'm expected to just keep hiking.So at age 50, this is so weird, I am learning all over again how to wipe. And YOU SHOULD TOO if you don't already have good habits.I bought a four-pack of marine dissolvable TP. I am using a roll at home with which to PRACTICE. And YOU SHOULD TOO ...I found some dissolvable wipes (Coleman) with which to polish said nether region.I hope to leave no trace in the woods, leave no trace in my pants, and leave no trace of butt-rash from general uncleanliness. AND YOU SHOULD TOO.It had to be said ...",,Dining Room,"Jan 11, Wed",0
ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553274,"Today, I'm gonna bring everybody down a bit ... but in the hope that these dark thoughts will help everybody rise up ... rise up and do what needs to be done.Last week I lost my mother-in-law. She was in her 80's and had been suffering from Multiple Sclerosis for decades. MS slowly but steadily took over my mother-in-law's body and health. At the end, she could barely feed herself, and was rendered unable to fight a bad cold. We buried her Thursday (today is Saturday).Last night, I lost a friend. Or maybe better to say an acquaintance who was becoming a friend. A gentlemen, member of our Model Railroad Club, died at our monthly meeting. Went to the bathroom. Didn't come out. Was found an indeterminate time later. We did what we could, the rescue squad did what they could. But it was all for nought.Some of us who aspire to hike the AT are getting on in years. I just celebrated my 50th. I'm in all likelihood more than halfway to the finish line. And I know that, it's possible, that I might be 99.9% of the way to the finish line. I am definitely going to look both ways crossing the street.So why the AT for me? Why now? Because this is the moment where I get the chance to do something that makes little sense, given conventional thinking in a routine world. I'm at a turning point, a crossroads, or some other pithy clich√© type situation. It may be now or never. When I was younger, I never thought so ... I was immortal. I was everlasting. I was ... as youth is ... completely in the dark!Now I'm not. And it's not sadness that I'm not. It's joy. Joy that I will not only ""get"" the chance to do something like this, but I will ""make"" the chance to do it, and I will treasure it. It's not too late. It's not too late to DO WHAT I WANT. And that is what humans should do. They should seek happiness. Happiness might include getting married, having kids, buying a house, preparing a retirement. But it is equally valid that happiness include seeing that sunset, hiking by moonlight, watching the stars (and the satellites and the meteors) trace across the sky. Watching a beaver slip into the river, a trout jump for a fly, even a yellow-jacket being an asshole-sinking his stinger in my arm. I'd rather have that than have no chance to see more ... to be more ... to do more ...And I suspect you feel the same way.I leave you with Carpe Diem, as taught by Robin Williams in Dead Poets' Society: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi0Lbjs5ECISeize the Day!",,Dinner Out w/Kids,"Jan 14, Sat",0
ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553353,"I read the most recent post from Roof & Feather: http://www.trailjournals.com/entry.cfm?id=553286Roof is tired of thinking about the gear. Well me too. I have this huge spreadsheet that I used to start making sure I had everything I could possibly need ... and then it got to the point of everything beyond what I might need ... and lately it is being winnowed down to that stuff that seems most important. My pack weight is OFF THE CHARTS. Part of this is a heavy external frame pack (I could save almost 3 pounds by switching) and my WARM sleeping bag (I could save a pound, pound and a half). But the rest of the weight is me being worried about leaving something behind ...Seriously ... I will be able to do minor surgery out there if necessary. And it is NOT necessary.So I have to have a come to Jesus moment about my pack weight.Now, for my title, above, I chose ""We Plan ... God Laughs"". I am not the most religious guy in the world. But I came across this phrase when working with a 12-step group for compulsive eaters (Overeaters Anonymous). They pretty much follow the AA program, and book, and the phrase is meant to remind you that you can be prepared ... but you cannot ensure the outcome ... of anything. You can do your best ... and fail. You can bring everything you can carry ... but the one thing you need will be back home.So given that, I am going to start removing items from my pack, one at a time, leaving only that which will absolutely positively be useful for 90% of all situations I will encounter. I think a goal like this might shave some serious poundage. I hope so.Now ... the Equipment List is taking final shape. BUT WHAT ABOUT FOOD PLANNING? I am still clueless and I am only two months out from my start. I think I'm in trouble. WILL YOU, dear Reader, post information about YOUR philosophy and methods of food planning??? I will learn something from everybody, I hope ...",,Couch ... Football,"Jan 15, Sun",0
ClevelandBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553970,"Finalized Items:1) Gear List. Still too heavy. I put a note on my trail guide to stop at Mountain Crossings for a pack shakedown. I anticipate some lighthearted teasing, and a moderate UPS bill for shipping stuff home.2) Section Map and Trail Guide. For first section, which is basically Springer to Davenport, I am using the National Geographic Map Book and my highly edited, customized version of AWOL's Guide (PDF Version). I was able to add notations in the PDF, delete unnecessary pages, change printing format (two pages per side, two sides), and get this section down to like 8 sheets of paper. Waterproof paper, ordered from Amazon.3) Food. It's gonna be oatmeal for breakfast, GORP for lunch, and Ramen for dinner. With a few other things. A couple of ""add-on"" items. Maybe a can or two of something. I am doing custom oatmeal, blending with instant oats, regular oats, almond slices, and fruit ... and sugar (raw sugar chunks). GORP, I am going to do a few different recipes. Peanuts, Raisins, Chocolate is the basic. But I'll throw in different nuts, maybe different dried fruits, yogurt raisins instead of chocolate, etc. Finally, ramen. I like ramen, but I imagine it could get old. So I have some add-ons: some freeze-dried veggies, beef, and some little sheets of seaweed, and etc. Some spices, too. I also have a couple/few packages of instant potatoes. And I imagine at my stops, I'll eat something great that isn't good to carry.4) Toiletry. In an earlier post, I detailed my shortcomings in LNT Poop skills. I have been practicing (not outdoors) but getting down to just several sheets instead of a huge wad of TP. Fun fun!!! And of course, wonderful conversation in polite society!I don't know what I'm missing, now, other than more hiking (despite our crappy weather this time of year) and make sure my boots are broken-in and comfy.I think I'm ready. Now I gotta do the really hard stuff ... finish the taxes, make sure the bills will get paid, attend to winding down my other responsibilities ... How are YOU???",,"Couch in front of TV, pilsener.","Jan 30, Mon",0

No.My biggest challenge is walking out the front door and putting home and family in the rearview mirror.If I can get my home life stuff under control ... and walk out the front door ... the Trail will take care of itself.
