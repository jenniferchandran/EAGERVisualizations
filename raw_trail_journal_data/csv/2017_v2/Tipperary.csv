,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556036,"In Boston for my last full day here. Spent yesterday practicing putting up my tent, and laying out my gear in logical groupings for packing. Went out to buy food - had to walk nearly a mile there and back but felt taking a taxi would be unnecessarily ironic...After shoving in 9 lbs of food and all the gear, my pack was 36 lbs, but that doesn't include fuel or water, so I am in a bit of despair as to what to drop, as 36 was my hoped-for outer limit. I've hiked in training with a 52 lb pack, but that was just once and it nearly killed me. I dropped back to 36 lbs for most of my walks in Ferry Reach and that was easy. I read people's journals where they say they don't bother with tent footprints, only have two pairs of socks, no toothpaste, etc. I think I am just going to drop a pound of food from my pack, and expect that I will eat 1.5 lbs daily and wing it. I'm sure on the trail I will be like all other newbies, sending gear home that we thought we'd have to have.

I'm nervous and anxious to get going. Last night my wife Gayle and my son Aidan went to the House of Blues for a Passenger concert. It was good to have 75% of the family together for a fun event like that; it would have been unreasonable to expect Aisling to fly up from Mexico City to join us...",,D-Day -1 Boston to Atlanta,"Mar 11, Sat",0
,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556198,"Yesterday I flew to Atlanta and took the train to North Springs where Survivor Dave (2008 thru-hiker who now runs a shuttle service) picked me up and took me to my hotel. I went out for a meal to a Chinese-Malaysian restaurant in a mall nearby. Continued to work on my packing. Printed off my Smoky Mountains permit. Went to bed and slept soundly until 5:50. After a good breakfast, I was again picked up by Dave who drove me to Springer Mountain, about a 2-hour drive, the last 14 miles on a pitted and rutted service road. From the car park, I hiked south for one mile to reach the southern terminus, took pics and signed the register, and turned around and started the official AT. There was snow on the ground but it was dry, at least until the temperatures went up enough to start melting the snow and ice in the canopy. I put on my pack cover and poncho at about the 4-mile mark. The going was often muddy, and my pants were filthy by the end. I stuck to my plan and set up tent at Hawk Mountain shelter. The shelter was full and noisy with several conversations going on at once. Surprisingly, I didn't feel hungry but cooked some oatmeal and had it with an apple, some spicy jerky, and a protein bar - a well-balanced meal. The actual hike from the terminus took me roughly 4 hours but the terrain was almost always tricky, with rocks, tree roots and even fallen trees occasionally. It's true that it did seem more uphill than downhill...

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556289,"Last night was cold, but I was as warm as toast in my sleeping bag, which is rated as adequate for temperatures down to 15F. I just could not sleep. There were strong winds in the trees that at least drowned out any snoring noises from other tents nearby. Before long the wind was shaking ice crystals out of the trees which sounded just like rain as they hit my tent. In the morning I had my first experience of taking down a tent in the woods - my hands were soon frozen and I dispensed with niceties like folding stuff - it all just got crammed into my pack. I left with Kyle, a 19-year old from Maine. He suffered from painful ankles and slowed down on descents but murdered me on climbs. The ground was dry and frozen, much better than the mud of yesterday. There were some gorgeous stretches of rhododendron alleys and others of open forest where you could see the trail meander away ahead. My pace today again was 2 mph, but my hips and Achilles held up. I pitched tent well away from the shelter at Gooch - there must be 40 people here. We had a roaring fire going and the usual fun trading stories and avoiding the smoke. I had another balanced meal of ramen noodles in vegetable broth, the last of my spicy beef jerky, and peanut butter on crackers. Now I'm in my tent with the rain pattering down. It's supposed to turn to snow later tonight.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556413,"Thanks to some Ibuprofen PM, I slept through most of the snowstorm last night, waking around 5am. I got myself organized in the dark, first knocking all the snow off the tent from inside. As I had planned on 12.7 miles today, I was on the trail by 8:30. Only a handful of hikers were ahead of me, and the snow had mostly melted on the trail itself, so it was a pleasant start and I found I had to shed my beanie and rain jacket and rain pants to stay cool. I didn't need to bother with gloves either. I was alone most of the time, occasionally passing or being passed by other hikers. I'd anticipated a 6-hour hike, but as I was going up a steep and lengthy climb I discovered I'd passed my destination earlier than expected and missed it. So I carried on to the top of what turned out to be Blood Mountain, an elevation gain of 1,500 feet in five miles. I was truly knackered, doing about a half-mile per hour at times. The top was glacial, with a howling wind, bare ice-covered rocks to navigate and other good stuff - I mean, what's not to like? Noah, a younger (much, much younger) thru-hiker passed me en route to Neel Gap. It was all downhill for 2.4 miles, and I recovered much of my joie de vivre. At the outfitters at Neel, I re-encountered Noah. The manager told us that temperatures tonight and tomorrow night would be 10F and that we'd be wise to stay in town if we could get rooms. When we found there was one room left in a motel in the town of Blairsville nearby, we agreed to share it and I got free earplugs from the shop since Noah mentioned that he snores. A customer at the shop, William Sperin of Irish ancestry, gave us a lift. I knew we were in the right place when I saw a suede (yes, suede) Star Trek poster framed in the reception area of the motel, and the owner's name is Colleen. We had almost free all-one-could-eat pizza at a spot across the street. Again, what's not to like?So tomorrow will be a recovery day and a laundry day and trying to figure out what the next destination will be.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556579,"It was so pleasant being able to sleep in a normal bed in the warmth of our motel room, getting up late, drying out gear, doing laundry, discussing with one's roommate the various hiking options over the next couple of days, dropping in to see Peggy in Foodland once more, and of course one again indulging in the pizza buffet across the street for the princely sum of $7.04. As we were almost the last to leave, the manager approached us as we tried to squeeze out the door and asked if we'd be interested in a pizza he'd prepared but hadn't sold. We agreed to take it off his hands. Back in the motel, I finally figured out how to add photos to these entries and added a few to earlier ones. This is all to appease my family. Of course it means I now have to take the occasional photo.I called up some of the shuttle services to enquire about rates to get Noah and me back to Neel Gap in the morning, and struck a deal with one chap called Jason. I also spoke to the famous Miss Janet who featured in David ""AWOL"" Miller's book about his AT hike. She's hilarious. She told me about Awol trying to retrieve a resupply package from her house-cum-hostel while she was out. I hope we meet her tomorrow when everybody is getting their rides out.I think I'm going to adopt my roommate, Noah. I hope his parents won't mind. He needs a strong father figure out here on the trail to advise him on ways to hang sleeping bags to dry, how to roll up tarps correctly, how to fit stuff ergonomically into a cup, and many other vitally important life lessons. I also need to talk to his girlfriend to let her know what she's getting into, not least of which is snoring. Food. Everybody on the trail talks about it, but at this stage it's in the context of how little we are eating. I must have hiked in with about ten pounds of food, but have made barely a dent in it. Of course, I am quietly discounting the nightly four pounds of pizza I've savoured last night and the night before, but the healthy salad with bacon bits that I had each night sort of counterbalances that, if you know what I mean. On the trail, I met Bill who is an AT ""ridge runner"" and who spent some time in Galway, where I went to college. On one of those encounters he told me that he was hiking out 15 pounds of trash, including an unopened 4-pound jar of peanut butter that someone had discarded in a shelter against all the rules about attracting bears. [On the subject of dumping: yesterday I hiked out of Gooch with a one-pound battery charger that somebody dumped in the snow by my tent-site. I plugged it in at the motel and it worked fine, and it fully charged my iPhone. I'm giving it to the motel folk to add to the kit hikers leave behind.] But enough about food.","Neel Gap

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556686,"Noah and I were picked up at 8 by Jason our shuttle guy. He is an ex-Army veteran who served a tour in Iraq and is now on disability. It was very cold at Neel Gap -about 20 degrees below freezing. I went into the outfitters to buy sunscreen and a water reservoir as I'm fed up with stopping every time I need to drink. Noah headed on. Immediately on leaving the outfitter the trail heads up an exposed hillside, and there was a bitterly cold wind. I had several layers on, plus a base layer hood, rain jacket hood, and gloves. My fingers went numb and it was at least 30 minutes before the exertion of the climb and some helicoptering of my arms got the circulation going. But as successive climbs followed, there was shelter from the wind, and by Cowrock Mountain I was part of a large group stopping to enjoy the view and the sun, and shed outer layers. I shared half the pizza I'd hiked in and had no refusals. Temperatures were supposed to peak at 47F today and it felt like it. There was my first sighting of trail magic supplied by Nudge Ministries at Tesnatee Gap - I helped myself to a couple of mini-Snickers as a lack of food is not my problem. At Low Gap Shelter, 11.5 miles in and the prettiest Shelter location I've seen, I stopped to finish the rest of my pizza and decided to push on. It was a good decision. The trail for several miles was fairly flat, curving around hillsides and defiles. Towards the end there was a difficult rocky stretch but I had a lot more energy than on Blood Mountain on Tuesday. I got to Blue by five, so 2.3 miles per hour including the breaks for food, and my longest stretch so far. I will be taking it easier tomorrow. Blue Mountain Shelter is on top of a ridge and there was a panoramic view of the sunset, all pinks and oranges. I was quickly quite cold as soon as I'd stopped and set up tent. Davis, another ATC ridge runner, showed all the newbies how to hoist a bear bag into the trees. I cooked some ramen, and sat by the fire for a few minutes, but decided being snuggled up in my sleeping bag was a better option. Several of my tenting neighbours were snorers so I was glad I'd brought along earplugs.

I opted to stay in bed late to let the air temperature improve a little. It was 10:30 as I left. About 2 miles into the hike was Unicoi Gap, where there was a lot of trail magic but I restricted myself to some oranges. There were two stiff climbs of 1,000 and 1,500 and as the sun came out I shed layers until at one point as I tended to a hot spot on a foot, I was sitting in the sun in my t-shirt and leggings.I opted to stop at Tray Mountain to give my knees a rest - the downhills are hard on them. At Tray I used my newfound skill to hang my bear bag in a tree again. This was after I had cooked up some dehydrated vegetables from Whole Foods and had a protein smoothie.I'm recognising many of the faces as the days go by. The zero days some take and trips to towns mean that you lose and catch up with people all the time. Noah did a big day and is 7 miles ahead of me now. I haven't seen Snail Pace or Two Dogs in a couple of days. But there's Jason, Alex, Chayva, Sweet Spot, Daddy LongLegs and many others here tonight. Rain is forecast for the wee hours.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557148,"I dismantled my tent in fog with a slight dewy drizzle going on. As a fellow-tenter said, it's sad when a good day is 39 degrees and not pounding rain. I was on the trail by 9:15. It was tough, in particular a seeming unending slog of 1,000 feet up Kelly Knob. Most of the descents featured black leaf-mold mud. It made for some exciting moments. I told Chayva, a thru-hiker with a liking for Simon & Garfunkel, that the appropriate song was Slip-Slidin' Away. I sang Follow Me Up To Carlow - bellowed it is more apt - as a way of tackling some difficult stretch. I enjoyed my new Hydrapak, a water reservoir, especially since I figured out a way to jury-rig it to the top of my pack and lead the drinking tube neatly over my shoulder. I ran out of water twice - I was sweating a lot, especially once the fog lifted in the afternoon.
At Dicks Creek Gap I was provided trail magic by a chap from Iowa - two of the sweetest oranges and an apple. I slugged it out from there to Plumorchard. Along the way I met 3 SOBOs, Duchess, Rabbit and Happy Pants. They started in Maine in Aug/Sept last year and are delaying finishing as they don't want the experience to end. (SOBO = southbound)
Daddy Longlegs traded me bags of almonds, banana chips and granola from his oversupply for a use of my lighter - the most uneven trade I've made, I agree. dog Shoes and Trailbait arrived late in the day at camp. 
So today completes my first week. I'm more or less on plan, have blisters on my hands from trekking poles and on one of my toes (now wrapped in black duct-tape and very fetching), but am in otherwise good shape.
Milestones during the week: every time I do another 22 miles, I say ""that's 1% closer to Katahdin"". I passed my first 50-mile mark. I've taken a 'zero' day ( a rest day, zero mileage). I've not yet slept in a shelter but that's coming once I hit the Smokies.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557150,"It was a warm start to the day, and within the first hour of hiking I was in my t-shirt and leggings and stayed that way all day. Straight away I finally saw not just one woodpecker but two. I'm told they are the large paliated woodpecker on which Woody Woodpecker was based. Three miles into the hike I crossed the Georgia/North Carolina border - I missed the sign, though. I was caught by Sweet Spot and Lucky Cub (an 18-year old born in Richmond but who grew up in Belfast). I managed to match their pace for a few miles. When they stopped for lunch, I continued on up Standing Indian Mountain. Almost immediately there was a long stretch of difficult path through boulders and rocks. Just after getting through it, as I started to get back into a rhythm, a rock gave way and plunged off the cliff-face, and I went with it. I managed to grab a tree branch with one hand, and swung over the abyss for a while before I was able to - actually I made that last bit up. I did slide off the trail courtesy of a rock sliding under my foot to record my first AT fall, and I had a rather ignominious crawl back up onto the trail through leaves and dirt and twigs. The 0.9-mile drag up half of the mountain was supposed to get me to the shelter, but with the fall and not paying attention I missed the sign. It was gruelling climbing. When I realized my mistake, I opted to crest the mountain and stop on the other side by a campsite with a stream. Unfortunately the trees were poor support for lifting my bear-proof food bag the required 12 feet - branches too high, too low, too skinny, but after 20 minutes of trying I managed to get it about 10 feet up. I cooked some food and crawled into my tent, exhausted by the day.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557153,"What a day. Had a very leisurely start. Took off at 10 from my private campsite, where during the night there had been no noise from restless and snoring campers to bother me, just the unnerving thought that if a bear rambled by, I would be its sole target. But all went well, although I was woken a couple of times by the pitter-patter of tiny feet investigating the exterior f my tent. Immediately upon joining the trail I met Beth from Virginia and her son Milo (13) who must have a jet-pack because he moves so fast, and Beth is not much slower. We met up several times during the day and finished together - I again sang us into camp. I also saw Lucky Cub as he hurtled by. I walked much more conservatively in view of my knee. The 1,200-foot climb up Albert Mountain, especially the sadistic last 0.3 miles which reminded me of going up Hacksaw Ridge, put paid to any wild idea I might have had of trying to make it the last three miles or so to a spot where I might have shuttled into town. So I stuck to plan, and stayed at Long Branch, at the foot of Albert. It's maybe the nicest shelter I've seen to date, but again I opted to tent.

From there a shuttle bus took us into the bustling little town of Franklin. Hikers swarmed everywhere. I checked into a motel, and in rapid order got lunch (big burger with two biscuits and gravy - great Southern comfort food), checked out lightweight backpacks at an outfitter, went back to the motel to shower and wash clothes, bought the damn backpack ($211), sent some surplus gear including my original backpack home via FedEx, caught a shuttle to Walmart to buy superlightweight camp shoes ($10) and more food supplies, ate dinner at a Chinese restaurant, and caught a shuttle back to the motel. As I write this, a big thunderstorm is hitting us. Glad I'm not up the mountain. Weight. This is a staple topic of conversation amongst hikers, both body weight and even more so, pack weight. My loaded pack comes in at 40 pounds, so today I've tried to get closer to the magical 20s by shedding a few items I've not been using, and by swapping a really good but heavier pack for a smaller and lighter one. I'm still carrying way too much food. Oatmeal, anyone?Oh, and as I know my brother Eamon will ask, a NERO is a 'nearly zero' day.","Long Branch Shelter

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557390,"Had a good night's sleep and was up and on a shuttle to the local First Baptist church hall by 7:15. They provide a free breakfast of pancakes and bacon to all hikers so everybody goes there. There's a little bit of mild proselytizing but it's a fair trade. I caught another shuttle back out to Rock Gap and was hiking by 9:15. It was a beautiful day for it - possibly the best so far. Sun all day, but moderated by some haze and of course being in the trees, even if they're leafless, does provide shade. Many times I overtook or was passed by the same bubble of hikers - Lumberjack, Struggles (not struggling today), Bucky, Sweet Spot, Pack Mule, Lucky Cub, Old Dirty Bastard, Stonewall, Low Tech, Attaboy, etc. etc. Yes, I know the names will be meaningless to all but the hikers themselves, but get over it. Bucky deserves a special mention. He thru-hiked in 2002. He was 65 then, so yes, he's 80 now, since Nov 7 last year. He's slow but steady and is headed for Maine! I felt very good all day. I stopped after about 10 miles to air my feet and boots, have lunch, and chat with hikers passing by. I had decided to stick to my schedule, which meant 19.5 miles, my longest so far. I hiked my own hike today, stopped often, and kept to a 2mph overall pace that saw me at Cold Spring Shelter by 7, just enough time to change clothes, get water, eat, and hang a bear bag before darkness. I am sleeping in a shelter for the first time. Or rather, trying to sleep. There's just one other hiker here - a Hungarian, 4-Wheel Drive, who said he was not a snorer, except when drunk. Well, he must be drunk.It's cold, although nowhere near freezing. My right knee continues to remind me it's there, but seems stable, not worsening. A blister on my right foot is slightly troubling - Lumberjack gave me Lugo [?] tape to wrap it with so I'll have to see how that works. Otherwise I'm stoked. I have food for a week, water available from springs and streams for filtering all the time. In theory I could stay on the trail well into the Smokies without resupply.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557401,"Last night I eventually got up at 2:20 am and popped a couple of Ibuprofen PM. I then slept until around 8. One advantage of being in the Shelter of course is there's no tent to put away. I tried boiling water for porridge but my gas canister was so cold it refused to cooperate. I remember reading that old hands put their water filter, gas canister, maybe even a water bottle in the sleeping bag with them to keep them warm. Must be a bit crowded.I got going on the dot of 9. The day's hike was long and featured the longest continuous descent in the AT, nearly 3,000 feet down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. There I stopped to rest and air my feet, and to buy a knee brace, fuel and more food, go online to pay a household bill, and to recharge my phone. I didn't see many people while hiking to NOC, but several familiar faces showed up before I left.I started the long 3,000 climb of almost 7 miles out of the NOC a bit later than planned. I got to within a mile or so of Sassafras Shelter and decided to stealth camp right by the trail with Scar, a retired engineer from Indiana.
I'd bought a dehydrated pad Thai dinner at NOC and was able to follow the 'destructions' (as my kids used to say) quite well (""add boiling water, seal bag, find something else to do for 20 minutes""). Delicious. I'm thinking this could be a great way to cook for friends. Giving them the recipe would be a problem, though.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557868,"I awoke around 7 after possibly the best night's sleep I've had since starting the trail. I think in part this was due to my tent-site not being perfectly flat, so that my head was slightly elevated. Scar was not a loud snorer, either. He said he had a very poor night's sleep.
We both set off together at 8:38. I'd already cooked porridge for breakfast. Scar hadn't done breakfast and opted to turn in at the next shelter to do so. I continued on. It was an overcast day, occasionally with light but cold winds. In sheltered stretches it was quite warm. I'm seeing more flying insects. Yesterday around NOC I saw the first flowers I've noticed on the trail, and the first tiny blue butterfly.
My right foot was troubling me - I had to stop at one point around midday to bandage a toe that was rubbing itself towards a blister. More worryingly my right heel is mildly painful and I try not to put it under too much stress when going uphill. (Of course part of the strategy is to lean heavily on, and push with, my trekking poles. This is why I'm still wearing gloves as my hands are not impervious to blisters either.) When your whole ability to travel comes down to your two feet, anything out of the ordinary with them assumes major importance. But I try not to worry or obsess about them either.
The major feature of today's hike was the much-hyped Jacob's Ladder, 0.6 miles of steep climbing with many switchbacks. I found it less fearsome than its reputation warranted, and continued on a further 6 miles to Cable Gap shelter. I was the last to arrive and had to settle for a spot on a bit of an incline above the shelter. I think it will be fine. I cooked a beef stroganoff that was very good, but not on a par with pad Thai. I've just noticed that it's supposedly 2.5 servings. Really, those Americans have no idea how to measure food...

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557870,"Today was very tough. I left at 8:15 from Cable Gap and within half an hour had sight of the Fontana reservoir, but it was 3 hours later before I was actually at it. There was a long 2,000-foot descent to the famous Fontana Dam - famous in AT circles, anyway. The shelter near the dam featured power and hot showers. I stopped long enough to take a shower, although I hardly needed one since I had one on Wednesday morning, less than four days ago. Some hikers were shuttling to town for food. I continued on. It was eerie walking on an actual road for a couple of miles. I crossed the dam without one vehicle passing by. Not the most heavily-populated area of NC. I was on my own on the trail most of the early afternoon. I started to miss human company. I'd have even settled for a purr from Pico, our cat. Once into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, it was six hours of mostly climbing, although there were a few minor descents of course, this being the AT after all. I figure it was roughly 3,500 feet of ascent. Jacobs Ladder yesterday pales into insignificance.On the plus side, I saw a dandelion and my first chipmunk of the trip - whee! But back to the negative side: as 'stealth' camping is frowned upon here in the Smokies, I had to make it to a shelter, so I had a hike of 18.1 miles today. Everything is sore - hips #1, knees #2, closely followed by left shoulder and left foot. I had fall # 2, nothing serious, just slipped and sat back on my bum. And I chipped a tooth somehow while eating supper. To think I could be back in Bermuda eating dinner at John and Beth's or the Schroders, guzzling immense quantities of their wine - what was I thinking??    Okay. Let's be positive. Today marks the second full week of the AT. Milestones this week: Crossed the Georgia/North Carolina border, did my first (and second) stealth camps, slept in a shelter for the first time, passed the 100-mile mark, took a 'nero' (means 'nearly zero' - I hiked just enough to get me to a pick-up point for a ride to a town), did the longest descent on the AT (into NOC). Oh yes, and saw that chipmunk.

So I heard no snoring and slept without earplugs for the first time. Around 3 I woke to the sound of rain pounding down. It was so nice to hear the wind and rain and be snug and warm. I got up shortly after 7. This was the first shelter I'd stayed at without a privy. While I was packing up, there was a big commotion in the shelter - a hiker had sprayed himself by accident with his bear spray. I eventually got hiking at 9. There was some hard climbing to a peak of 5,527. I fell again, but same soft fall as yesterday back onto my backpack. It was warm enough for me to stay in my t-shirt all day.

It usually takes me an hour at least to get on the trail after I wake up, and so it was 7:54 when I hiked out. I was the third to leave. Just before I left, a huge ol' turkey strolled by the camp, making its gobbling noises, totally unfazed by all of us shouting and pointing it out. A hunter beside me said ""They just know it's not hunting season."" Apparently they roost at night in the trees, come down and make noises to find each other, then go silent as they forage with safety in numbers. On the trail I several times saw what looked like deer hoof prints.   Today's route took me from a low of 4,882 ft to a high of 6,667 on Clingman's Dome - the highest point on the AT. It was a long day, but the climbing was gradual and far less strenuous than usual. There were even - audible gasp - level stretches! There was fog and, around the summit, rain, so there was no view. But after the first five miles the trail entered a pine forest, which was beautiful and sometimes eerie - all this vivid green moss and fallen decaying trees and dozens of streams. Walking on a path of pine needles felt like being on carpet. (Of course, regularly also, there was mud. Lots of mud. I like it when it's on a downhill slope as you can do controlled slides, which are fun and also an efficient way to move ahead. And to people behind you it looks like it's a treacherous section so they go cautiously. I overheard one couple ask each other ""how is Tipp so fast on the downhills?"" 240 pounds foot weight and gravity will do it, that's how.)I made it ahead of schedule to a big vista point called Newfound Gap, where I tried my hand at hitchhiking. Almost instantly I got a lift for me and another hiker, Dead Man Ale, from Randy and Susie. They moved some gear around in their van so as to fit us in, said not to worry about muddy boots, and deposited me at the Day's Inn in Gatlinburg TN, 15 miles away. The check-in process was less than stellar and I ended up changing rooms. But I was able to meet my former hiking buddy from Blairsville, Noah, and we went out for dinner and some resupply purchases. So now I have washed the mud off my tent layers and they and all the rest of my gear are drying off nicely in AC. I feel clean and pampered. FaceTimed Gayle. Bliss. Yawn. G'night.

Sean from Redexim, a Dutch manufacturer of high-end golf green maintenance machines, picked us up and dropped us back out at the state border. We were hiking by 8:38. Noah is way faster than me, and he wanted to do 20+ miles, so I wished him luck and off he went. I took it really easy. Last night I had downloaded an app that shows a map of the AT and all the shelters and notable features along the way, and that was useful, although it does drain my phone's battery rather heavily. Just using the guide book, it's often hard to tell exactly where one is on the hike, and it can be dispiriting to realize one is still a mile or two away from one's destination; the anticipation of finally arriving and shedding the backpack is enormous. The weather was warm but foggy - the sun peeped through a few times late in the day. The route today was - I think - back and forth across the North Carolina/Tennessee border and featured a very much up and down profile, with no individual huge loss or gain in elevation. I was expecting the 15 miles today to be as easy as yesterday, but that was not the case, and the last 4 miles were tough. I got in at 4pm. There were no good level camping spots, but I managed to squeeze in between some pine trees a hundred yards from the shelter, which is full. I am far enough away that I am hopeful of a good night's sleep. The photo accompanying today's journal was actually taken yesterday at the steak place Noah and I ate at. We found it hard to leave those rocking chairs. ","Newfound Gap

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558193,"I had a reasonably early start (8:15) after a muesli breakfast. This was one of my best days on the AT. I planned to get out of the Smokies, which meant a hike of at least 20 miles. The main advantage of being ex-Smokies is the freedom to stealth camp. The day was sunny and clear. It was largely downhill. There was a climb out of Tri-Corner which was made easier for me by Québécois community TV cameraman, 33-year old Hula Hoop - a terrific climber who paced me up, but who allowed me in front for the downhills, where I have yet to be rivaled. Hey, those extra pounds finally come in useful! He eventually took off on one hill to go see a view that was off the AT and left me, and I had the descent from 6,300 feet to 1,373 feet all to myself and a young student called 2.0 complaining about his knees, who almost kept up to me. At the bottom I stopped for 30 minutes to change socks, finish my water, and eat a little. The rest of the hike, five miles, was uphill in the warmest temperatures on the AT to date - I had to break out my hat, sunscreen and bandana for the first time in a few days. I took it easy, stopping several times, including once to catch up on emails as I found Verizon coverage suddenly. I arrived at my planned stop - a campsite by a stream, with just one hiker set up, a local 62-year old chap called Drifter, since that's what he does. Later we were joined by Indy, Zookeeper and McFly. Indy is a recently-qualified natural resources manager specializing in fire management. Drifter and he had a lot to say about last year's devastating fires which started near Gatlinburg and killed 14 people. While we were eating dinner, a hiker showed up with bloodhounds. His name is Bloodhound and he is a very unusual trail angel. In his backpack he had a six pack of PBR - a Pabst beer (the predictive text feature changed that word to Pansy, which Bloodhound would have agreed with, since he described most American beers as being poor), a big block of Colby cheese, some sausage, and crackers, all of which he proceeded to divide up and serve us. No beer has ever tasted as good, and the edibles weren't bad either. We chatted about many things. He took some notes, as he writes trail-related articles in his spare time, and left to hike back down the mountain, even taking our trash with him. It was the latest I've ever been to bed in the mountains. As I type this, at close to 11pm, there is no sound of snoring around me. The wind is light but thunders high above through the treetops. The stream is faintly heard. So far, so good.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558195,"After possibly my best night's sleep in weeks, I was almost reluctant to leave Painter Branch campsite. By 8:39 I was on my way, although not without yet another fall as I crossed the Branch (stream) and my foot slid on a tree-root and I slid down the bank. No harm to anything but ego, especially since I hadn't even made it the fifty yards back onto the AT. The day was overcast and windy. There was a short climb out of camp, then miles of relatively flat going. The main event today was Max Patch, a 'bald' that extends quite a distance and attracts local hikers and strolling couples as there is road access not far down. The 360-degree views were spectacular and photos just don't do them justice. The sight of serried ranks of mountain ridges, each a slightly paler shade of blue than the one in front of it, reminded me of the faded Japanese paintings in my erstwhile colleague James Bodi's office. Delicate, almost fragile colors. A natural watercolor. Sigh. I guess you had to be there. I stopped at the shelter below Max for a long foot-break (change socks), eat, top up water, use privy. I was the only one there until Kaleidoscope, she of the super-white teeth, arrived with her dog, whom she had picked up after being separated from her for the Smokies (no pets allowed because of the bears). Back on the trail, I met Geezer again, at roughly the same time as yesterday. He took off and stealth-camped along the trail. I wanted to hit my 20 so climbed up Walnut Mountain; I stopped briefly at the shelter at the top and ran into Noah, who did a short (13-mile) hike today. I continued on down the other side and then back up the last 1,000-foot climb of the day, Bluff Mountain. Here I am, at 4,686 feet, stealth camping by myself. I've had my dinner of noodles and tuna, a vanilla protein smoothie, with a Snickers bar for dessert. I've hung my bear bag after about fifteen gazillion attempts, spoken by phone to Gayle, and now here I am doing my blog. Such a rut I am in. Hey, what's wrong with that? I like ruts.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558310,"Day 20Another pleasant night, this time atop Bluff Mountain. Sometime during the night it started to rain and conveniently it eased off by 7. I had some muesli for breakfast, packed up my wet tent and headed out. 8:32. I immediately met Noah and two other hikers coming up from Walnut shelter. It started to rain again and I deployed my poncho. I tried to keep up with Noah - big mistake. I have yet to learn that a 58-year old may not always be able to do the things a 22-year old can. I eventually stopped trying to keep up with him, but not soon enough - shortly afterwards my left Achilles started to bother me, followed swiftly by pain from some muscle or ligament on my left knee. I limped into Hot Springs soon after midday and stopped at the first place I came to, Hillbilly Market, where I bought probably way too much food. It was turning noticeably colder when I emerged. I went around the corner to the Smoky Mountain Diner which supplied me with a giant burger, fries and onion rings, and two vats of lemonade. None of the food went back to the kitchen when I was done. I struck up a conversation with a lady near me who it turned out had been to Bermuda and loved it. She's also been to every continent including Antarctica. I limped on down to the library to join all the other hikers in the warmth there using the free wifi and charging our phones in the comfort of nice armchairs. Noah came to join me for a chat. He's very happy with the hostel room he has, which he's sharing with another guy. I spent about two hours in the library. During that time, two hikers I'd met three or four times on the trail, Murphman and True Grit (who are using two cars to shuttle themselves along the AT) came in and we chatted about our recent experiences. Murphman suggested I switch the knee brace on my right knee to my left. I did so, and it seems to have helped. I finally dragged myself out to my backpack and stowed away my electronic gear and started hiking again. My goal was to find a spot to camp a mile or two up the mountain outside Hot Springs. I finally stopped after about 3.5 miles in a charred clearing just off the trail, but before pitching my tent I used my newly-charged phone (at precisely midnight Irish time) to call my now 87-year old mother and sing Happy Birthday to her. She thinks I'm mental, of course, for doing this crazy hiking stuff, but she loves me anyway. To those of you imagining my poor little mother being woken up from her sleep at midnight by her feckless eldest son, all I say is: you have no idea of the hours we Gormans keep. Back on the mountain: a major achievement - I got my bear bag cord over a high branch on my first throw! Why were there no spectators present to see this?! It usually takes me ten minutes of throwing and swearing. And I'll leave you with this last image: there I am, curled up in my sleeping bag, all cute and","Bluff Mountain summit

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558436,"Okay, so today didn't go so well. It did start well, though. I didn't even wake until after 7. I felt rested and energized. I finished off the last of my muesli by cooking it as a sort of muesli porridge. I had an apple. All was right with the world. The day was overcast and cool, just the best weather for hiking. I broke camp at a leisurely pace, not getting hiking until 9:12. My feet and Achilles and knees all felt great, like new. Then at about 200 yards into the hike, I stepped on some leaves at the edge of the path, which turned out to be covering a tree branch rather than the path, and I fell. Really fell. I tumbled down the slope, rolling from side to side like kids rolling down a hill. I stopped after a couple of rolls. Nothing seemed broken or twisted, but I was a bit shaken. I resumed my hike. Soon I came across a retaining wall about 20 feet high with water flowing from a pipe near its base, so I stopped to replenish my water supply. I climbed up the path beside the wall to discover that it had been built to create a large pond for wildlife. Soon after there were open fields and remnants of a building, and a sign saying that the former tobacco and hay farm had been bought in 1970 by the Forest Service for use as a turkey and grouse brooding area. All went well until about three hours into the hike. Whereas yesterday it had been my left knee troubling me, today it was my right knee, only more so. Going uphill was fine, but downhills were painful. I stopped at a shelter to swap my knee brace back onto my right knee. It didn't help much. I abandoned my plans to reach a campsite about 19 miles from my starting point. I took a long break in the sun on the Tennessee/ North Carolina border, at Mom's Store, a quaint ramshackle shop run by Wayne, where I had two ice creams, refilled my water reservoir with Powerade, and bought 2 Snickers bars, since on a hike you can never have too many Snickers bars. (No, I didn't eat them; they're for later.) I sat in a rocking chair and chatted to Wayne. In 40 minutes I was his only customer. I pressed on the four miles to the shelter. Luckily it was mostly uphill. On two downhill stretches, I walked backwards at times. My poles were in heavy use. I actually made good time, and came charging into the Shelter area, rather than crawling. I cooked a quick Knorr rice-and-vegetables meal, eating a hot sausage while it was simmering. Now I'm back in my tent, eating dessert of chocolate malt balls. I'm hoping a good restful night will sort out my knee.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558654,"So I woke up pleased at how pain-free my knee was. It was a beautiful morning, clear sky, no wind. I broke camp and by 8:31 I was rolling. (I love that 'broke camp' terminology. So reminiscent of those John Wayne Westerns and military stuff, much better than 'took down my tent and stuffed it in my backpack'. Move 'em on out!). The profile for the day's hike was pleasantly easy - gentle undulations, no truly massive ascents or descents. I caught up with Ho Chi Minh, a Canadian chef, and we hiked together for about six miles, including one gorgeous rocky ridge line section where we were looking to the west at flat farmland and towns and roads, and to the east at more familiar mountain vistas. At about mile six my knee began bothering me again, and I took a lunch and foot break at a shelter at mile 7. It didn't help. It was seven more miles to the next shelter, and by then I was back to snail pace, dreading the downhills, contemplating quitting the AT. At the 14-mile mark of the next shelter, I watered up, and decided to hike past the shelter for a more secluded camping spot, limping along. A random rock tripped me up for my first forward fall, almost onto my face. It was a new low for me. I stood up, checked for damage, and at a stream a few paces on, washed off the mud I'd acquired from my left leg. And then I noticed something amazing. The pain in my right knee was gone. I was able to hike pretty much as before. I ended up doing another 3 miles, enough to get me to the Laurel Hostel, a small 6-bed bunkroom that had two free spots left, and I said heck, here we go. New experience. Might as well try it. My knee pain had resurfaced on the last half-mile, so I was glad to sit down, have a few beers and pizza (prepared by Tim, the young proprietor), and chat with the other 4 hikers there. They listened to my moaning and unanimously upbraided me for not resting my knee sooner. So I am taking a zero tomorrow.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558662,"Although there were five of us in the small bunk room, the room was incredibly quiet last night, with nobody snoring or tossing and turning. I had had a shower, some beers and a pizza, was relaxed, but I just could not sleep. I finally gave in, took sleeping pills, and got to sleep around 2am. One reason is that the hours of hiking, 50% of it on average being fairly strenuous climbing, leave me with a heart rate that stays elevated above normal for hours afterwards. People started to move around 8am, but everybody was taking a zero day. Around 10am, Tim the owner took 7 of us off to Erwin for lunch at the Clarence Diner. I had a pulled pork sandwich with mushrooms. Then we were ferried to Walmart where I bought a second knee brace, some tortillas and oranges, and a baking tray. It was pouring rain most of the middle of the day. I spent most of the rest of the day in my bunk, making a windshield for my propane stove. Everybody was impressed with the engineering. Candy Cane, one of my bunk mates, was lightening her pack and passed me various trail mix, stuffing and other delicacies. She also passed on to me a pair of compression socks she hadn't used, which I put straight on under my two knee braces. Ho Chi Minh played me an excerpt from an audio book, Dubliners by James Joyce, the piece in which a character recites a poem about Parnell. I FaceTimed Gayle and we made plans for Atkins. Tim had taken a bunch of hikers to Erwin for an evening meal, and when he came back I had him cook up another pizza for me. I sang my AT trail song.

Tim, the hostel owner, retuned from town with several hikers he'd shuttled in for a meal. They came back loaded down with beer. Goat, one of my bunk mates, asked to hear me sing the song I've been writing in my head about the AT as I walk it, and I sang it for all. Oh So (Santos Ponce), another bunk mate, posted a video of my song to Facebook! I also sang the one verse I know of 'Avondale', the song about Parnell, and 'Danny Boy' on request from Ho Chi Minh. Then the bunk mates all went to bed, leaving the others drinking beer on the patio. A Swiss guy threw up eventually and was hustled into the shower in just his underwear to wash off. Ho Chi Minh and other fans watched a basketball game on his iPhone for hours on the patio. Around 11pm I got up and went outside to get them to turn off the light and quieten down. Oh So thanked me- said she really didn't need to know that one of them had brought a supply of Viagra on the trail. I hDnt heard that as I'd had my earplugs in; I did manage to get to sleep soon after. We were all up around 7 and I got on the trail by 7:43am. I took it easy to be nice to my knee - there was a lot of climbing to do. It held up well for the first half of the day, about eleven miles. At that point I heard a cheery ""Hey Tipp!!"" and looked around to see Noah bounding up the trail to me. We took a long lunch break together and were joined by Thread, a young hiker I'd not met before. I did my usual foot care routine, changing into fresh socks, airing my boots, etc. Noah headed off after 30 minutes; I rested 30 more. But my knee started to act up. From one mountain-top bald we could look six miles ahead to another bald way, way up there. It looked an impossible distance away. I got there around 5:30; there was a shelter soon after the crest and Noah was already ensconced in the shelter. I opted to keep going to add a few more miles and get a quiet spot. I found one, set up my tent, cooked dehydrated potatoes with sour cream, chives and stuffing- yum! I tried out my new toy that I made yesterday, a windshield for my stove. It looks fabulous but was a total practical disaster. Another $3 totally wasted. So today was 18.1 miles; I'm guesstimating about 4,500 feet of climbing. I'm perched at about 5,000 feet right now. Cool.

Maybe they were thinking every day would be like the one I had today. I hit the trail at exactly 8am, in fear and trepidation at how my bum knee would behave. I dropped down the mountainside from where I'd camped, and then hit miles and miles of generally level trail, with gentle undulations up and down. My knee rejoiced, and gave me no trouble. The weather was mild, a bit humid, and overcast. Around 12:30 a big breeze sprang up and a tree limb cracked in the forest near me; it started to rain. Then 15 minutes later came a long peal of thunder. Stop. Deploy backpack cover. Deploy poncho. Lightning, four miles away roughly. Arrive at the town of Erwin soaked because of wearing stupid poncho; would have been drier just letting the intermittent rain hit me. As I approached the hostel at Uncle Johnny's, Noah came out to say hi. Of course, he'd been there for hours, having cheated by getting there on his secret flying carpet. I stopped to buy some high-priced trail food, recharge my phone, and post my journal for yesterday. About an hour later I headed off again. There were the usual hugs and tears as Noah and I said goodbye yet again. I climbed for four solid hours and 7.5 miles, topping out at 3,516 feet where I pitched my tent at 8pm. In total I'd done 22.1 miles today, a new distance record for me. And this with a knee that only yesterday had me thinking my AT was over. Unbelievable. Up on the mountainside, I cooked fettuccine with broccoli and ""chicken flavor"", and made myself some tuna wraps while it was simmering away. I'm not feeling hungry.

As I climbed Unaka Mt to over 5,000 feet, it began to sleet, with strong winds, and eventually to snow. I was in a t-shirt, and had to put on my jacket when I reached a shelter where I topped up on water. I ploughed on. At the top of Unaka was a dense spruce forest. I was feeling great. The miles flowed by. At 12:39, after about 11 miles, my left knee suddenly destabilized. It was back to powering uphill and limping downhill in the increasing cold. I knew I could go on indefinitely, but when I reached mile 17, and saw the sign for Greasy Creek Hostel, 0.6 miles off the trail, I headed for warmth. The hostel was indeed warm, with a roaring wood fire, and a warm welcome from the owner and her partner, Ce Ce and Gadget, respectively. There were six other hikers there, variously spread between a three-person bedroom in the house, and the rest of us out in the (unheated) bunk room. We ordered food from a local diner, and several of us piled into Ce Ce's car to collect it. It vanished in record time back at the hostel. I had a pint of Ben & Jerry's Phish Food as well. We watched ""Passengers"". I weighed myself in my clothes and I'm guessing that I've lost about 14 pounds. Now to log this and head across to the bunk room. Brrrr. My sleeping bag better work.

The snow had had little impact at Greasy Creek, but as I climbed, more snow lay on the ground - about three inches. It was cold and I wore my jacket, leggings and gloves. Upon rejoining the trail at 9am, I immediately saw the tracks of 4-5 people. I caught up with a group of four hikers whom I'd passed yesterday at the spruce forest. Then there was just one set of tracks. They turned out to belong to the 64-year old former golf pro, Energizer, who had been at the hostel and left a while before me. When I overtook her, she was glad to have me be the one breaking a path through the snow. We climbed, man did we climb. First it was 1,000 feet to the top of Little Rock Knob (4,918), drop back down and climb over 2,000 to the top of Roan High Knob (6,212), a climb through pine that just seemed to go on and on unmercifully. We stayed on a ridge and came to a bald. I looked way off in the distance to a distant bald with a trail up it, and said to Energizer ""I wonder if that's the AT?"" She didn't think so, based on the direction. By now we had come out of the snow in the forests and were in the slush and the mud climbing up to the bald, and the same going down. We'd been hiking for over four hours. I drew ahead of Energizer, whose plan was to stop at a shelter, whereas I still had hours of hiking ahead of me. I got to try out the old sliding-in-the-mud technique I'd learned in Georgia. With the snow and slush and water and mud, my boots finally admitted defeat, and became soaked. But I was not getting cold feet. The highlight of the day was arriving for me - the trail across a moor and up the bald I'd spotted earlier - called Hump Mountain (5,587). It was a vast open space to descend, traverse and climb. There was a ferocious wind which regularly knocked me off the trail into the grasses. It was cold. But the views were spectacular. My sense of isolation was acute as I climbed and looked back for nearly two miles of trail, seeing nobody, and seeing nobody ahead when I looked down from the summit. I could see across valleys to towns, distant mountains in a panoramic encirclement as the sun dropped low in the sky. I took a lot of photos but they rarely do justice. Finally I hurried along to achieve the final goal - cross for the last time the state line between North Carolina and Tennessee. For the last two weeks the trail has run along the NC/TN border, so that you literally at times could have had a foot in each state. So, so long, North Carolina! There was a campsite right at the ""Leaving NC"" sign, and as I arrived at 7:15, two section hikers, Ryan and Ryan, were setting up a tent there. I got water at the creek and joined them at their roaring fire. I boiled water to cook my Black Bart Chili With Beef & Beans. I must say, it was exquisite - though not on a par with the pad Thai from a couple of weeks ago. Both Ryans have been to Ireland and were very articulate and fun to chat to. I went to my tent around 9:30. It's already below freezing I'd say. But what a day! Over 24 miles walked, my longest AT section walked to date (23.7, as the 0.6 back to the trail from the hostel doesn't count). And my legs held up well. And the scenery!

I should have gotten up and put on more clothes but I couldn't face the prospect of unzipping my bag and letting all that cold air at me. I had my beanie pulled down to my nose so that all that was exposed to the night air was from my nose to my chin. I went on to have a really good night's sleep. I woke around 7 to the sound of the Ryans chatting in their tent. It was 29 degrees. I packed up and was on the trail by 8:17. While it was cold, there was no wind, and I was comfortable. The ground was frozen so all that mud from yesterday was no longer a problem, and my boots began to dry out. I dropped downhill for three miles into Tennessee. There was a bit of everything today - freezing cold, sunshine (from midday on), pine forests with that carpet of pine needles on the path, 100-foot high trees, rhododendron tunnels, a big river where I washed my feet and rinsed out my t-shirt (it was too cold for me to swim in), umpteen small and big streams, gentle climbs and forgiving descents. I aimed for at least 20 miles, and it was such easy terrain that I did 21.4 with no difficulty. In part I am sure the reason it's becoming easier is that my food supply is dwindling (and I may even eat it all before my likely next resupply, in Damascus, VA, which I should reach on Tuesday). Plus my body is lighter. So my muscles and joints are having to deal with at least 20 fewer pounds to lug uphill or to shock-absorb coming downhill. I ended the day by arriving at Moreland Gap shelter at about 7pm. I found a spot on the trail a hundred yards after the shelter where I was able to pitch my tent, create a chair out of a tree stump and a big flat rock, cook my ramen noodles and create a couple of sausage wraps, and hang my much lighter bear bag without drama nearby. Poles: I love my Leki trekking poles. I would probably not be able to hike without them. I use them as extra engines going uphill, and I lean heavily on them when descending to save my legs. Of course, my shoulders have had to toughen up, and my poor hands have taken a beating, so much so that for the first two weeks I wore gloves to prevent my blisters from worsening. Milestones this last week: well, I finally left North Carolina for good; passed the 400-mile mark; did my longest day's mileage; hiked through deep snow; experienced my boots getting wet; stayed in two hostels.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559456,"What a difference a day makes. I had set my alarm to get up at 6:30, and it was not cold in the tent. I hardly needed my jacket as I dismantled the tent. It felt like it was in the 50s. I got going at 7:54 to the sound of a nearby woodpecker hammering away. I felt a bit tired in contrast to my starts on the last two days. The opening salvo was a steep climb up from the shelter that had me panting, then sweating. But then came level and descending segments. One of the disadvantages of being first on the trail is that you become the spiderweb collector, until you reach a shelter which has emptied out, and the path ahead is cleared. With the heat of yesterday afternoon and all day today (it hit the high 70s), I saw loads of butterflies and one gorgeous yellow, black and blue one called the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (http://tabletopwhale.com/2014/08/27/42-butterflies-of-north-america.html). The route today led me along the banks of another river as it meandered through a gorge and threw itself over a waterfall at one point - Laurel Falls. It was truly gorgeous. I met quite a few day hikers out enjoying the sudden good weather. I kept on thinking of my dad, who died in 2013, and how much he would have liked it. He never had the chance to do anything like this - providing for six kids took all his energies, and by the time he was my age he'd had both hips replaced. I could just visualize him and how he'd be quietly taking it all in. The only issues for him doing the AT would have been getting Mass on Sundays, and packing some of that most wonderful of inventions, canned draft Guinness. But back to the river. It came to an end, or at least my meandering alongside it did, when the trail headed up the mountain for 2.6 miles and an ascent of over 1,700 relentless feet, in the glare of the sun. I thought it was the most ridiculously-named mountain (Pond Flats), until after two hours I came to the top, which was flat, and featured a very small but indisputable pond. It also featured a tent with two naked people disporting themselves who scurried into the tent as I came whistling by. ""Good afternoon"", sez I. One of them just waved at me. On the way down, I had to stop to tend to one of my toes; Lumberjack's Leuko tape came in handy again. (Last night I'd also used it to bandage cuts on my thumbs where my skin has been drying out.) I have now lost two toenails, one on each foot. I mean, who needs toenails anyway? When I am faced with an enemy, I rarely claw them to death these days. Too messy. The descent from Pond Flats dropped me onto a sandy beach at Watauga Reservoir. There were lots of people enjoying the water there. I just dumped some trash in a bin and sauntered by. Because of bear activity last year, several miles of the AT by the reservoir are closed to all but AT hikers (and even we can't stop or camp, and the Watauga shelter is closed). By now it was about 5pm and I was feeling very tired. But I made it through the closed section including crossing the Watauga Dam, and climbed up the hill at the end of the closed section for another mile and a bit, looking for a site on which to camp. I finally had to go off the trail up on a ridge and clear a reasonably level spot on top. I am definitely alone, and can see the reservoir and the lights of some town down in the valley. I'm at about 3,000 feet. When I picked the spot, I dropped my backpack and immediately set about cooking and eating, and only then in the sunset light with my hunger appeased, put up my tent. All is well.

Today promised to be sunny, and I searched high and low for the bandana I wear to protect my neck, only to find it after several minutes - around my neck. That was the first instance of ""you idiot"". There were others. I hit the trail at 8:10 am. It was cloudy and a bit humid. But by midday it was hot and sunny. The day's hiking sauntered from a starting low of 3,000 to a high of 4,095. I'm now at 3,506. It was the easiest 21 miles I've done so far. Around midday a small brown snake scuttled out of my way on the path where he was sunning himself. He didn't appear at all frightened by me and let me get up close for photos. He was about 15"" long but very slender. He seemed to be just the kind of snake you'd want for a pet, or to bring home to introduce to your mother, if your mother wasn't the type to say ""Jesus Mary and Joseph don't be bringing that thing in here"". I also was teased many times by these black and blue butterflies that just will not sit still for a photo, quite unlike Snakey. I think they are a type of swallowtail, either pipevine or spicebush. So my day just rolled by with walking. And more walking. And then some more walking. I saw not one NOBO apart from a chap called Redleg who was sitting alone in the last shelter I passed by, at 5pm. He said I was the first NOBO he'd seen in two days. I did meet about 9 hikers heading south, but they don't count. I am now less than 12 miles from the border of good ol' Virginia. I will be on the road to Damascus tomorrow.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559825,"When I get out on the trail each morning now, there's a period of assessment. I liken it to one of those Star Trek episodes when, after a Klingon attack the day before on the good old NCC-1701, Kirk bounds onto the flight deck after a good night's sleep, and calls up Scotty. ""Scotty, status update?"" ""Aye, cap'n, well mysel' and the rest of the folk in Engineering have been up all night doing what repairs we can. Ah can confirm that the left foot second toe is no givin' any problems. The left Achilles and calf seem to be back to normal. The left quad, well we've patched it up as best we can, but..."" ""Yes, Scotty, and status on knees?"" ""Och, they're the least of the problems we're dealin' wi' down here. There's a wee bit of cavitation from the upper flexor on the left foot, but I think we can safely come up to Warp 5 from impulse power but only if you need it. Anything above 5 and you may be pushin' us beyond safety levels."" So it goes. I hike on. Of course, invariably one or more of the starship Enterprise's engine parts breaks down in the course of the day and starts calling for Doctor McCoy. I am always amazed at the recuperative and restorative capabilities of my body after a good night's sleep, aided by Ibuprofen. Today was a milestone day. For one thing, I have now spent an entire month - 31 days - on the trail. And I crossed from Tennessee into Virginia. From now on, the AT is always definitively in one state (or commonwealth), leaves it behind to go to a new state, and doesn't inflict the North Carolina/Tennessee back-and-forth ambivalence on us again. I was on the trail at 8.00am. I would have been a little earlier, but finally it happened - I could not find where I'd hung my food bag. In the late evening, it seemed obvious, but then you wake up, and all trees look similar, and did you go east last night or was it west? I eventually found it of course. On other nights I've actually dragged dead trees in line to form a pointer to where my bag is hung, but I didn't do that last night. I had run out of water last night, but less than 200 yards on from my campsite was a road crossing and a stream. I was filling my Hydrapak when Redleg arrived, having done three miles in less than an hour to catch me. He's an ex-Army vet who did two tours in Iraq, once as invader, second as occupier. When I commented on his speed, he attributed it to his years carrying 100 lbs of body armor plus a 12.5 lb rifle, and several lbs of ammo, grenades, first aid, and assorted manuals. So a 30-lb pack is a breeze for him. I suppose I have to join the army. I quickly told him I was not able to keep up with him, and let him motor off. Several miles later, I came around a bend and there he was. This time I made a manful effort to stay with him, had to admit defeat, and then rue the attempt as Scotty reported major issues in the quadriceps. I limped across the state line into Virginia and made it to Damascus about three miles later. In short order I (a) resupplied on food at Dollar General; (b) visited two outfitters who, contrary to trail wisdom, would not swap out my large-frame backpack for a small-frame which would suit me;   (c) eventually found a drug store selling hand sanitizer; and (d) dined at Mojo's where I ordered the 8-oz hamburger and, when I'd finished it, ordered and ate a second (Bubblehead, please note!). Plus I had four Mason jars of their house lemonade. I also ran into Redleg reclining on the porch of a hostel, quaffing bourbon. He had told me that when he leaves a town, he always packs out five plastic pint bottles of his favorite tipple. Which reminds me - one outfitter, learning I was Irish, and as I was the only customer in the store, reached under the counter and pulled out a bottle of local moonshine, which he forced me to drink from. Twice. I escaped, but I did think when I was back on the trail that I should have bargained for the bottle. It was good stuff. I climbed out of town, my pack freighted down again with lots of food and water. I was amazed when, at Moonshine Man's store, he weighed my pack and it came in at 32 lbs (before I added about 4 liters of water at a spring outside town). I thought it would be more. Out on the trail, at precisely the point I had planned to begin looking for a place to camp, a footbridge had been washed away and the detour was very poorly blazed. I opted to ford the river and continue on the old trail. Of course my guide book and trail app were no help in finding a campsite since I was on the 2016 trail, it was getting dark, and then I came upon a teacher and his group of boarding school students who pointed me in the right direction and suggested a great campsite by the river. So here I am, having set up camp in the dark, bathed in the river, and downing my trail magic bourbon from a couple of days ago. Ahh. Not bad.

Being under trees means that the 'rain' continues for hours after the actual shower is over. And it sounds loud in the tent. It's always unpleasant the morning afterwards rolling up a wet tarp and trying to seal it off in my backpack from precious dry cargo such as my sleeping bag. My hiking day extended from 8:10am to 7:10pm. The sun popped out fairly quickly, and it was a bit humid for a while. Two NOBOs, a young couple, powered past me mid-morning. I met two AT volunteers maintaining the trail - one, Hot Rock, had a very impressive-looking machete-saw. He offered me a Snickers bar, which I gladly accepted. Both of them are EMTs. Hot Rock has done both a NOBO and a SOBO; despite this, he looks remarkably sane. I also scored some trail magic - a can of Dr Pepper - right after crossing the Luther Hassinger Memorial Bridge, the longest footbridge I've seen on the trail to date and part of the apparently famous Virginia Creeper Trail, created out of the route of a former railway line. The big event of the day was the 1,900 foot ascent over 4.3 miles to Buzzard Rock at 5,080. In the middle of it, Redleg overtook me. He'd started his hike about 90 minutes after me, and about 5 miles further back, and still managed to close the gap. He stopped for a breather on Buzzard. I kept going to reach my target of at least 20 miles and stopped for the day at a spot called Deep Gap. It's a confluence point of two or three trails at 5,015 feet, it has big boulders that work well as seats and table, has lots of level spots, and I and an owl have it all to ourselves. The only downside is that the water source is unusually far away down a side trail - not appreciated after a hard day on the AT. Had I known, I'd have filled up my water supply earlier on the trail - but it is nice to hike the last few miles with no water weight. Can't always get it perfectly worked out. And I enjoyed my can of Dr Pepper with my pad Thai. No Chateau Lafitte ever tasted as good

I had a big breakfast of cooked oatmeal, tortillas with kippered snacks, and a big slug of veggie smoothie. I was on trail by 7:40. Things mostly went downhill after that - literally. I dropped from 5,000 feet to where I am now, at 3,300. Of course there were the occasional ascents, including one of 840 feet, but most of the going was flat or descending. Eight miles of the trail was exhilaratingly different from what I've seen before - open terrain full of rocks and boulders, and climbs up to rocky outcroppings. There were many supposedly wild ponies present under a wildlife management program that uses them to graze and control certain plants and shrubs that would otherwise overrun the grasslands. Most of the day I was hiking alone, although I met a lot of families and couples out hiking for the day and enjoying the parks. Several times I passed and was overtaken by Jedi and Bubbles, a young couple I've run into over the last two or three days. We ended up stopping at the same campsite at a place by a paved road called Dickey Gap. They opted to camp on the grass verge up by the road despite the traffic noise. I stayed down by the trail and the stream that runs alongside. Around 8:40, a thru-hiker named Pudge arrived. She's a friend of Bottles.

The traffic noise did decrease, but in a way that only made it all the more disturbing when a big truck would reach the top of the hill, and there would be a roar of engine noise as it changed gears. I was glad I'd set my alarm for 5:45. I broke camp as quickly and quietly as possible and was on my way by 6:45. I had had no phone coverage for the last several nights so was glad to find a high spot relatively soon where I could send text messages to Gayle, who would be meeting me with her dad, Jake, at a road crossing. After six miles, I breezed past the first option, a paved road, and continued on another four to the next crossing, of a gravel road. I was about 45 minutes early, and Gayle and Jake duly arrived in a rented red Jeep, Jake driving. We went back down the road to the town of Marion, where the first order of business was to do my laundry at a laundromat. We left the clothes to dry and headed to Walmart for a few items Gayle hadn't brought off a list I'd sent her. Then we headed back to pick up my laundry, before hunting down a Macados for lunch. I ordered a pitcher of lemonade for me and their 16-oz ""Boomer Burger"" and fries. By the time I'd finished all that and a cookies and cream milkshake, I was full. By contrast, neither Jake nor Gayle ate much more than half their orders. And they had no milkshakes. One thing Gayle brought me was a belt - very necessary to hold up my hiking pants as I'm shedding so much weight. Then it was back to the pick-up point to resume my hike. Gayle was remarkably controlled when it came time to part; she just got Jake to take a few photos and reminded me to take my vitamins. I had offloaded my now too-warm sleepwear, beanie, gloves and a big tub of Vaseline, and somehow managed to fit the lighter sleepwear and about nine days'-worth of food into my pack. Shortly after I set off back on the trail, the problematic buckle of my left shoulder-strap broke in two. I knotted the strap to the loop the buckle was attached to so that that strap could do some of the load-bearing. I am now convinced I will need to replace my backpack (an Osprey Exos large) with the small version when I get off the trail in Richmond. I unhurriedly bridged the four-mile gap to the next shelter, the Partnership Shelter, where I'd planned to take a shower, but the showers are only turned on once winter is over, and I guess it's still winter then, despite the heat. Just before the shelter, I passed a couple already bedded down for the night in their sleeping bags, no tent - what is called 'cowboy camping' - it didn't look very wintry. I rocked on for a couple of miles more, and pitched my tent high up on a ridge, glad to be alone. I filled my bear-proof food bag and a stuff bag with all my edibles and somehow was able to hoist the dual load aloft into the trees. I made an experimental repair to one of my gaiters, replacing the torn retaining strap that goes under the boot with some of the excess cord I have for my bear bag hoisting, and settled down to get caught up on at least three days of journals, since I have coverage up here on this piece of the AT.

I was enjoying listening to my music on my iPod - a luxury I'd decided on when giving Gayle a list of stuff to bring me. So I simply started with the first album, 'Abacob' by Genesis, and let it roll alphabetically by album. Soon I had Abba coming at me, Malian desert blues, Andy Irvine, Abantu, U2, Portuguese fado - yes, quite the variety, and I was just rolling along, up hill and down dale, pretty much alone apart from occasional SOBOs. Near the town of Atkins I met quite a large group of trail maintainers - many of them young ladies of school age - hacking away at the edges of the trail with mattocks, leveling it. Atkins itself did not attract me. I'd had a thought of checking in at the Relax Inn, a motel right by the trail on the highway, but I had only done 10 miles and felt no particular weather-related or injury-related reason to head indoors. Okay, it's been quite a few days since my last shower, but I don't smell bad. Not really. And I'd had my burger-and-lemonade fix in Marion less than 24 hours before, I was more than adequately supplied, so I just passed through the town's outskirts and plodded on, nodding my way in time to some Turkish music. There were stretches of the trail that led through farmland - big empty fields with warning signs about sticking to the path. I took things easy, not forcing the pace, surprised at how relaxed I felt. I think finally my 'trail legs' have come in. Even with the overloaded backpack I have again, I eased up the slopes and didn't hurt on the descents. My pace is still about 2 mph, maybe a little more. Around 6pm I'd done my quota for the day, and started watching out for campsites. I found the perfect one, just after a road crossing, but around a bend in the trail, so traffic noise is eliminated. There's a stream gurgling beside me. I got a big supply of water from it and shampooed my hair and took an almost-shower. I feel quite civilized with my clean self, socks washed and hanging out to dry, bear bag neatly hung right beside me, tummy full of BBQ'd pulled pork sandwiches (thanks, Jake), Idahoan mashed potatoes, and a bag of Cadbury's chocolate Easter mini-eggs (an almost religious experience). Milestones: so today saw me complete week five. Yes, thank you, thank you. I'm healthy, on schedule, the weather has been great. My backpack choice is disappointing, especially since it's pack #2 for me on the trail and is generally accepted to be the go-to brand and model on the trail. My boots may not make it to REI in Richmond. Yesterday I passed the 25% completion mark. I read somewhere that in doing the AT, you climb the equivalent of 16 Everests. If so, yesterday I reached the peak of Everest #4. During the last week, I completed Tennessee, state #3 of the 14 I will encounter.

And that was just the first ten miles. After that, there was a descent, and a lot of ridge-running for miles at 4,000 feet. As it turned out, the climbs were okay, as it was cloudy with a light cool breeze. The first half of the beast was tough, but the second was across summit grassland and was easy. I stopped in the woods after the summit as I found I had great coverage and caught up on my journal for yesterday as well as family messages and emails. Along the ridge there was a light rain. Ironically, I ran out of water, and around the 20-mile mark was really unhappy with the world. I eventually downed the contents of a stream I found, and then it was downhill to a shelter. I opted to skip the shelter and camp a hundred yards away right by a creek. I'm getting to like the sound of rushing water as background noise. It's 8pm and I am aching and tired.

The climb back up the mountain on the other side was brutally steep but even at my pace only took me 24 minutes. My pulse was racing at the top. The rest of the day was relatively easy going. The rain was what we'd call in Ireland 'soft', meaning it would soak you but only after an hour or so. I just stored my electronics away, deployed my backpack cover, and went on. Again I met not one NOBO, but several SOBOs. I was aiming to reach the 600-mile point and camp, but when I got there, it was after several miles with no water resupply, and I was dry. So I had to continue another couple of miles to the next water source, which was at a shelter.

Even if it's torrential rain, set up your tent and bed down there. Last night was about as bad as it could be. I was lying next to Smoky, a fine fellow but a great snorer. (And how is it that the snorers are always the first ones to go to sleep? Why can't they ever be inflicted with insomnia, huh?) Three people over from me was Mattress Boy; I'd commented when he was setting up that he had one of the noisy mattresses that squawk every time you shift in your sleeping bag - he seemed to resent the (factual) comment. And all through the night he tossed and turned, and his mattress amplified his every move. So I lay still and quiet and awake; took some Ibuprofen PMs around midnight; fell asleep around 1; woke at 3. At 4:30 I said screw it, time to go. By 5:39 I was on my way, my new early-start record, handily eclipsing the record set only the day before. I used my headlamp for the first half-hour. The day was overcast and cool. There was little climbing until about midday. Until then there were lots of streams and mud and long alleyways of rhododendron. The climb went from 2,600 feet to 3,900 feet in 2.6 miles. The sun came out when I stopped for lunch at the top. Eating, admiring the view, chatting with other hikers, and making a couple of telephone calls consumed 80 minutes - quite an unusual thing for me, but I'd done 17 miles by then and felt I'd almost done for the day. I had planned on going to the next shelter mainly because it had water and reaching it would be a new distance record for me of 24 miles. When I got to it, I was still feeling fresh, which was good, as the camping options were poor. 1st Sergeant, a retired military veteran, arrived just after me, as did Smoky (ex-Marine) and advised us to keep going the mile or two more to some power lines where there was good camping. We watered up and moved on. Smoky took off on his bionic legs, and by the time I reached the site (which was 3.7 miles away, not one or two), he'd already set up his tent and was getting a fire going. I set up mine far enough away that he can snore his head off. We ate dinner and went to our respective tents. So I am quite chuffed at having set a new distance PB of 27.7 miles! The rain has held off until now. Tomorrow is expected to be very wet. But before I sign off, and to revert to being a trifle grumpy: a little time back, as I climbed a very long and challenging ascent out of a town, loaded down with my backpack as usual, I met three hikers coming down the climb, 'slack-packing' - meaning they were doing the hike sans packs. They had been shuttled to the top of the mountain from their lodgings and were dropping back down to the town, where they would get their packs and then be shuttled back up to the top of the mountain to head down the other side as they continued the trek north. I've mentioned this to other hikers who, like me, think it's almost a form of cheating. Oh, ""Hike your own hike"", I can hear other hikers say (especially the slackpacking descenders), but it's certainly a fact that while they can truthfully say ""We hiked the AT"", they can't say ""We climbed every ascent on the AT"". They will have climbed 15.x Everests, not the full 16. The quality of their AT thru-hike will be lower than mine. Sniff. Not that I care. I'm just sayin'.

My hands were soon numb from the cold of taking down and folding my wet tarp, but yet again I was lucky to at least be putting my gear away without it also raining. I left as soon as I was packed; Smoky was a little later in getting going so we said our goodbyes. He is planning on a series of 25-mile days before his girlfriend joins him and slows him down. Starting at 7:09, I walked fast to cover the slightly more than five miles on the AT to reach the paved road into town, and then started walking the mile or so on that road to reach the motel I'd booked into yesterday. It rained for a mile or so while I was on the AT section. Down at these lower altitudes, everything is greening up; soon the higher elevations will follow suit and it will become impossible to look through the trees at what lies ahead as the trail curves away. The wildflowers are blooming and even the green of the grasses is quite luxurious. I walked a half-mile to the outskirts of Pearisburg and a gentleman heading in his pickup to his game of bowling offered me a ride the rest of the way; he said his name, given him by his grandmother, was Jug. I threw my backpack and poles in the bed of the truck and squeezed in front beside his kit bag. I was glad of the short lift as I find walking on the paved road quite punishing on my legs. I checked into the Holiday Motor Lodge ($50) and basked in a shower, my first in twelve days. I headed the hundred yards to a Hardees. I saw Smoky in another eatery along the way. He'd already done his shopping, including scoring a $4 fleece at a Goodwill to replace the Patagonia fleece he'd lost or had stolen a few days ago, so he was quite happy. At Hardee's I ordered and ate: their last biscuit with gravy; one ham biscuit; and three steak biscuits. Even I had doubts that I could put them away but in the event I needn't have worried. The large lemonade and large Dr Pepper I had helped wash them down. While there, Tim Brightman, my PMC cycling team captain from the Boston area, called me to catch up. Later, across the street in Food Lion, my former work colleague Sarah Demerling called me to see how I was getting on. I even managed to prod text messages out of both my children. Once again oversupplied with food for the trail, I headed back to the motel to do laundry, charge my devices, and eat the 1.5 quarts of Turkey Hill Cookies 'n Cream Premium Ice Cream I'd bought (hey, I have to keep my strength up). [By the way, is this too much detail? Sorry. I'm almost done. Did I mention the eight oranges I'm eating for dietary balance?] I started reading a random Jodi Picault novel I picked up at Goodwill, and when it came time for dinner I took it across the street to a Mexican restaurant where I had a very fine T-bone steak and shrimps with a humongous Dos Esquis cerveza.

I took another shower just for the heck of it (who knew that one's hands could get so clean, even under the fingernails? Awesome.) For some reason I didn't have much of an appetite, but I ate an orange just to reduce the volume of food for packing. In freshly laundered clothes, I sauntered out into the overcast, very humid (93%) morning, gave my keycard to Mary the receptionist who was sitting outside the office having a smoke, and started walking. I had no lift to the AT but it was mostly downhill and oncoming drivers waved to me. I hit the trail at 8:46. The mile or two of leaving Pearisburg is dreary - the trail runs on or close to the highway; there's a long bridge to cross; you are skirting the industrial side of the town with manufacturing plants, railway, freight trucks; when you get climbing away from all that there's a surprising amount of rubbish (light plastic bags) in the bushes until you realize that the chain-link fence paralleling the trail is the edge of a landfill. I met a young Danish couple, Friendly Ghost and Beetle. They were pleased to meet another European. We kept on leapfrogging each other all day. It's not a race, but I did get to the destination before they did. During the middle of the day, there were thunderstorms to our west that traveled across the trail and dropped some light rain. There was a lot of up and down. I climbed over 4,500 feet during the day, and descended 3,700. A lot of us (and for once there were lots of us that I ran into) were aiming to stay at The Captain's Place. This is the home of an unusual man who for twelve years has been letting hikers stay on the mowed area beside his house. The AT is across the river from his house, and to get to it you sit on a thing like a kid's swing in a park and zip-line across to his lawn. It's quite fun. Once there, there are benches, a big fire-pit, a fridge full of soft drinks, a plethora of level spots to pitch a tent, and fresh water from a tap. I ate with my Danish friends as well as Snaps (paramedic with excellent French from childhood in Lyons), and a young brother-sister couple, Rash and Piñata. I mentioned having once been to Taizé, a religious community near Lyons, and Rash not only had heard of it, but he has some of its music on his phone. I would not have bet on that.

There was a big climb straight away of about 1,300 feet. Then there was a running of the ridge line for about six miles. Much of it was rock-covered, so that imposes its own costs in terms of the need for constant vigilance as to where to set each foot and plant each pole, and the stepping or hopping from rock to rock for hours is hard on the joints. Plus, at some point during the morning I noticed that the carbide tip on my left pole had disappeared, like the one on the right pole a couple of days ago. This means that the ability of the poles to grip onto a rocky surface is vastly reduced and the poles cannot be relied on unless you plant them in soil or in an indentation. The state of my left boot, with the upper starting to rip, is mildly concerning too. The waterproof shell is still holding up. I hope I can eke another two hundred miles or so out of the soles, as that will put me at REI, an outfitter in Richmond, where I will sort out boot, pole and backpack issues. There was a second big climb in the afternoon of 2,000 feet. I ascended very slowly. There was a thunderstorm while I was climbing and some light rain. Hermit caught me just after the crest, while I was calling my son to wish him a happy birthday. Hermit arrived late at the Captain's last night so I didn't see him. We both watered up at a shelter at the 17-mile mark but opted to continue further. For me, that meant another three miles. They were three very tough miles simply because the rest of the day had already exhausted me. (In total I climbed 4,700 feet today.) I arrived at a paved road where it crossed over a bridge on a river and decided to pitch my tent on a flat spot nearby. At least I have plenty of water handy.

It should include Alaska, of course, but when the US grabbed Alaska I imagine the Canadian response was something like ""Ah, actually that really belongs to....oh, never mind, just go ahead"". I love Canadians. John Martin, one of my best friends, is Canadian. He's a great cook and does this amazing berry dessert that he knows I adore. I guzzle his wine and port and whisky and he just smiles benignly and asks if I'd like some more. But about the AT today. So there I was, packing up my wet tent. And again there was this immediate climb of 1,300 feet, and it started to rain. And there were more of these wretched rocks on the ridge line. I slipped and fell, just moments after observing that at least the rain had washed my hands perfectly clean, even my fingernails. Splat! I'm in the mud up to my (left) elbow (literally). #%!@?? So I wash some of it off in the pools of water on top of rocks along the way. Then out of the rain come two SOBOs, a middle-aged couple, and I try to move off the path to let them by by moving up a sloping boulder. Of course I slip and slide and fall on the rock. !@&$?? They were very concerned. When I mentioned that I'd lost both carbide tips to my poles in the last few days, the lady fished around in her hip belt pocket and found a spare carbide slip-on tip that she insisted on giving me. What a nice gesture! Did I mention they were Canadian? At least on the ridge line, I found decent cell coverage, so there I was, during one rain-free spell, sitting on a bench near the Audie Murphy memorial, updating my journal for yesterday and communicating with my wife. Audie was the most-decorated soldier in US history. After serving in WW2, he died in a plane crash near the AT here. His simple memorial is surrounded by a cairn of stones built up over the years. Service medals, ribbons, dog tags, flags and other memorabilia bedeck the cairn. I imagine a fair few tears are shed there, as many of the hikers are veterans or ex-military; many wounded veterans hike the trail as therapy. I had started the day tired, but at an empty shelter at midday I stopped to have a lunch of three tortilla-Nutella wraps. Yeah, I know, Nutella is just candy disguised as nutrition but so what? At least it tastes good, unlike peanut butter. What is it with Americans and that stuff, anyway? I came back on the trail with engines roaring and stayed that way until I passed the 21-mile mark and called it a day. I'd been hiking from 7:39am until 7:14pm, and I'd climbed over 4,900 feet. I found a spot a few yards off the trail that at some point had been camped on. I managed to (1) pitch tent, (2) cook mashed potatoes with pepperoni slices and Tabasco sauce, (3) have a tuna wrap, and (4) hang my bear bag before the rain returned. It's cold - maybe in the 40s but I'm munching on my second Snickers bar and reading my novel. Sucks to you, weather. And check out the photos of the wild orange lizard I almost stepped on right before I camped.

I got on the trail early, at 7:39, with fog and mist giving everything a Gothic look. Within less than three miles I had climbed to the top of Cove Mountain where I ditched my pack to take a short side trail to see Dragon's Tooth, a monolithic rock on the edge of a cliff. It would make a great setting for a scene from Game of Thrones. The descent from Cove, though, was for me the most technical I've encountered on the trail so far, down rocks where every step and pole plant had to be planned in advance, and where a misstep could have resulted in a serious fall. Sometimes I had to let my poles just hang from my wrists and use my hands to haul myself into positions I could advance from. In two places the trail maintainers had put in stainless steel rungs as otherwise there was no way anybody other than a rock-climber, and certainly not a hiker with a heavy pack, could have been expected to make it down. On the descent, I passed the 700-mile mark. Then it was on to McAfee Knob 12 miles away, across varied terrain including pastureland with grazing cows. The ascent to the Knob begins at a parking lot right on a main road. Even though it is a trek of almost four miles, it is a favorite with locals and visitors alike, who can take the 'difficult and strenuous' AT trail up, or the gentler 'scenic route'. As it had begun to rain some time before I arrived at the parking lot, there were only a few hardy hikers who had driven up to do the climb. I stopped at a shelter one mile into the climb, and finished off my jar of Nutella. I came back on the climb with engines roaring, and powered my way up. The trail had become a stream, often with water pooled along it. By the time I reached the summit, from which of course there were no views, I was soaked and reluctantly opted to don my poncho. Good move. This time I was able to get it on easily over me and my pack and it helped me warm up, which was a good thing as the temperature seemed to drop as the afternoon wore on. Five more miles of slogging through mud and puddles got me to Tinker Cliffs, which were breathtaking, especially as the trail meandered for a considerable distance right by the edge, which would not be for the faint of heart, or for me if it were windy. I had the cliffs to myself in the rain. Shortly after the cliffs, I saw two more of those orange lizards. I will have to Google them. I rolled into the destination shelter after 11 hours and 16 minutes of hiking. There was a crowd there, including Surly, a friend of Lucky Cub and Sweet Spot. I last saw him just before Greasy Creek Hostel, over 300 miles ago. Everybody started making room for me, but I opted to tent. ""Brave man"", said KJ, one of the crowd. And setting up in the rain by the nearby river meant I got stuff wet and a trifle muddy, but nothing abysmal. I woke at 1:15 with the rain lashing the tent and some was leaking in. It was bound to happen sooner or later.

This included my socks from yesterday. I then put them on, and stuck my feet into my wet, cold, muddy boots. I had dry socks, but what was the point of putting them on? Ah, the joys of the full camping experience. As I went by the shelter, I stopped to chat with the gang there. Although they all appeared dry and distinctly unmuddied, they all seemed to be planning to stop for an overnight in the town of Daleville, less than ten miles away. Wimps. However, after less than a mile of squelching along in my sodden shoes, the thought of a dry bed and a shower - look, I'm sorry, I'm weak, and I confess that I am typing this in the luxury of a Howard Johnson motel, after a giant pulled pork BBQ meal (with peach cobbler and ice cream dessert), washed down with two large flagons of ale. So there. I have bought ten days' worth of food, washed out my clothes and tent, and even bought a Nike rain jacket for $4 at Goodwill next door. I am not proud, but I have wifi.

After breakfast at 6am , of scrambled eggs and biscuits and gravy, I took it easy for a couple of hours and got going by 9:09. I was wearing my poncho at first but when the threat of rain receded I put it away. After a couple of hours I came to a stream that had been swollen by the recent rains. It was now impossible to cross by hopping from rock to rock; all the rocks were submerged. So, in my nice dry socks and somewhat dry boots, I forded the stream. Water reached halfway up my calves. At further streams afterwards, I repeated this exercise four more times. My boots were no longer dry, but let's look on the positive side: at least they were clean, and the water wasn't icy-cold, and I didn't fall in. I stopped in at Wilson Creek shelter around 2pm for a snack, to remove stream pebbles from my boots, and to wring out my socks. There were four other hikers there, the first NOBOs I've hiked with in at least three days. They stopped for the night at the next shelter, but I carried on to Cove Mountain, and finally pitched my tent at 7:40, a long day paralleling the Blue Ridge Parkway, with 4,500 feet of ascent built in. I have done over one-third of the AT. I have a massive amount of food picked up in Daleville*, enough to see me through the next eight days, I hope. My legs are in good shape, and as I use up the food and my pack weight drops, maybe my shoulders will stop screaming at me.

Ah, the joy of packing up a dry tent. But the hiking day was tough. 6,400 feet of climbing - lots of ups and a few small downs (like a good marriage). I had intended to do about 23 miles, but it was getting too late for that by the end of the day and I was exhausted so I stopped at a shelter after 19.7 miles. The weight of my pack affected me no doubt, and it was very warm most of the day. Again I saw no other NOBOs all day until I pulled into the shelter. I met a number of SOBOs, a mix of section hikers and thru-hikers. Among them were Parson's Trippin', a pastor from western NY state with a big camera and a small tripod strapped to his chest; he took a video of me. I also met Charley ""Trapper"" Smith, a 74-year-old trail maintainer. At the shelter, my gas canister ran out as I was cooking, but Slider, a section hiker I'd first met at breakfast yesterday back in Daleville, boiled my water for me (i.e., ""cooked""). I am beat. So a short entry today.
PS Late addition to Day 45: How could I have forgotten this? So, avid readers will recall that on that day I met four hikers taking a break at a shelter at midday. One, Glim-Glom, mentioned that he'd been to Ireland and had even driven through . He somehow met a young hurley manufacturer there, who had given him a hurley for free. I looked at him, stunned, and asked him if by chance the hurley was a miniature one, and he said it was. He couldn't remember any other details of where, or name, but I told him that he had probably met my niece's boyfriend, Cathal.

At least that's how it started out at 7:52, with a huge set of descents of about 6,000 feet in total to the crossing of the James River. There was also some of the nicest trail I've seen on the AT, with a wide and mostly level path, gravel base, vegetation not in the way, and all experienced in sunshine. But then at the end, with storm clouds gathering, there were two stiff climbs totaling 2,000 feet to get me to my planned campsite. I took a big break in the middle to update my prior day's journal. After that I was refreshed and completed the second half of the climb in fine form. At least, I would have if I hadn't fallen and grazed my left hand near the wrist on some of that great gravel. The cut didn't interfere with the pole strap. I grabbed a handful of dry grass to stem the bleeding and was impressed with my macho approach until I stumbled and opted to fall into the leaves off the edge of the trail to save myself from more cuts. Worse was to come. On arriving at Saltdog Gap, I discovered that (a) the campsite was virtually non-existent and almost overgrown, (b) the water source was a half-mile away downhill, and (c) the trail to the water was signposted as closed due to flooding. It must have been closed for at least two or three years as it was almost impossible to find. I fell two more times trying to forge a path through the leaves and rocks. Oh and that lovely 'greening of the trail' that's been taking place this last week or so? Well, I discovered that about 20% of the charming greenery is nettles, and they sting. I eventually found the water source, and it was a good one, filled my bottles and thrashed my way back up the hill and started to set up my tent just as a huge squall came through. I had everything unpacked and lying around and everything got soaked. I had planned to make a fire to boil water for my meal, but now all the wood was wet. I spent about two hours drying the inner tent. It's 11:30 as I type this but hey - my phone seems to be behaving itself again so I will count that a net win for the day. Excitement earlier - on that lovely flat stretch, I was startled by the sudden roar overhead of what looked like an F14 fighter jet that pounced over the ridge beside me with no advance warning sound and rocketed down the valley. Frightened the dickens out of me.

At almost 2,600 feet elevation, I was above the fog-line and the sun was shining. As is so often the case, I was faced with an immediate climb to the top of a peak called Bluff Mountain. I was listening to my iPod and as I reached the top, on came Bach's iconic work, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor. (Even if you think you don't know it, you do.) And there, spread below me, was a sea of fog, pierced by mountain-top islands. It was mesmerizing. I took photos, and I think they capture a lot of the glory. I realized that I was the only person in the world seeing this particular view. It made up for a lot of what I'd suffered the night before. I dropped down 2,000 feet, and at the Pedlar River Bridge, came across an amazing sight - dozens of butterflies and bumble bees in some kind of feeding frenzy. I took a video and photos. They seemed oblivious to me. I crossed the bridge, passing the 800-mile mark on the trail. There followed a long stretch of almost level going. I paused for 90 minutes at a campsite by another bridge to empty my pack and put up my tent to dry. I put a tarp on the ground and put everything on it to dry - food, papers, odds and ends. I hung my sleeping bag from a tree branch. In less than an hour all was fit to be repacked and I resumed my hike. The level path arced up. In the course of the day I would achieve 5,700 feet of ascents; 2,900 of that would be on this killer climb to the peak of Bald Knob at 4,059 feet. I just put my head down and tried to be relentless in putting one foot after another. It took me 90 minutes of non-stop cadence to finally reach the top. The 2 litres of water I'd started the climb with were long gone and I was still sweating. I survived a couple of smaller high-altitude descents and ascents before limping into a grassy meadow called Hog Camp Gap at 3,500 feet. I started a fire and boiled water for my noodles, water supplied by the Burnham family - parents with three young girls - who were also camping there. It's so nice to be tucked in in a dry sleeping bag, with a phone that seems to have stopped auto-typing and auto-deleting. Tomorrow looks like a much easier day of ridge-running at 3,500 feet for 12 miles; there's a knee-killing 3,000-foot drop almost at the end. Can't wait.

On one climb there was a set of steep stone steps and in my hurry to get out of the way of a descending group, I tripped, and dislocated the middle finger of my left hand. This was annoying on a number of levels, so I popped it back in place, got out of everybody's way, and kept going. And here I was just minutes before congratulating myself on having had no falls for a day and a half. It was good to roll onto the peak of The Priest where a bunch of young men from Richmond fed me granola bars as we admired the view. The 3,000-foot descent was often over rocks so progress was slower than I might have expected. At the foot of the mountain I stopped to refill water at a big river, and chatted to yet another ex-military chap. It was very warm and humid - I heard it hit 92 degrees. The last 2.8 miles to the shelter were uphill, but oddly enough I felt very strong. At the shelter I found tons of tents set up. I asked a young man, Matt, if I could use his fire to boil water, and he kindly agreed. He and his friends Nick, Sean and Brendan are down from New Jersey for the weekend. I enjoyed their company immensely, and then headed off to scout out a tent site. Tent erected, I went back down the trail a few yards to wash out my sweaty clothes, shampoo my hair (luxury!), and bathe my fetid body. I feel like a new man. This being the end of my seventh week on the AT, milestones this week were: passing the 800-mile mark; ascending the sixth of the 16 Everest equivalents you climb if you do the AT; fording streams and getting very wet; setting up tent in the rain and getting very wet; falling a record four times in one day; being buzzed by an F14; and yes, dislocating a finger.

I climbed up onto the ridge over the shelter and found I had good coverage, but a weasel for a phone. While I was doing battle with it, another hiker joined me. He is Fox, an auditor with E&Y in Orlando. He moved there from NY at the request of his firm, and agreed to do so on condition they allow him to take all his vacation in one chunk, which he used every year to hike a section of the AT. This year he started in Pearisburg and wants to get to Harper's Ferry. Our strengths were complementary - he's good on climbs and I'm good on descents. So we took turns leading depending on the incline. Plus I like to talk and he seemed to like to listen. We went up hill and down dale at a decent pace. At Reed's Gap, we stopped when offered trail magic by Jeff, who had set up an awning and a table and was serving pulled pork BBQ with Coke to thru-hikers. He had folding chairs for us. We chatted. Jeff has had two back surgeries and loves hiking. He's determined to get back in shape by doing beasts like The Priest. Time flew by. I had a second Coke. Eventually I realized that Fox was considering heading down the road to a brewery, so I raised my pack onto my back and went back on the trail. I soloed the remaining 14 miles to the Paul C. Wolfe Shelter, arriving at 7:14 pm. It's right by a river, like the shelter last night. I'm the only tenter - there are five others in the shelter. I climbed almost 4,600 feet today.

I left the lovely surroundings of Paul C. Wolfe shelter later than I'd planned, at 7:47. I was aiming to do 24 miles. The rain came along and that meant that there were no views. I had to put my phone away in my backpack. Fewer people were out. So all of that meant that I had few interruptions and just simply concentrated on hiking. As a result I was amazed to see that I reached Rockfish Gap so quickly - my average speed was 2.5 mph over five miles. A word about Rockfish Gap. This is on the Skyline Drive. On one side of the mountains is Waynesboro, the town where Jake, my father-in-law, worked for DuPont all his working life. Some distance away on the other side is Charlottesville. Countless times, Jake has driven my family to and from the airport there. Gayle and I for 13 years had a house nearby. I have cycled up the Drive past Rockfish. So it was quite emotional for me to be at this intersection of my past experiences and my walking the AT, despite the rain. Although I climbed over 4,600 feet today, there was a lot of reasonably level trail and no killer ascents or descents. I feel that I am still getting stronger. I know I'm getting lighter!  My legs felt so effective and pain-free. (I hope it all translates to biking effectiveness too, but I don't want to be greedy. I'm just so happy that I'm rockin' the AT.) After Rockfish Gap, I concentrated on smoothness of stride and speed, and decided to aim for Blackrock Hut, which would give me nearly 26 miles. I got there just after 6pm. During a brief lull in the rain, I quickly set up my tent. It felt strange being in it in daylight - I've become used to settling in just as daylight is disappearing. I was famished, and could hardly wait for my food to cook. Now the rain has stopped.

I paused at one point to take it off and one of the ladies in the shelter last night, Shebeast, caught up with me. We hiked together the rest of the day. She is from North Carolina and is section hiking a chunk of the trail in Virginia. She has done all the rest bar Pennsylvania which she plans to do in August. The day warmed up and I was soon applying sunscreen. It was great having a trail companion, another victim to listen to my great stories - they truly are riveting. Noah can vouch for that after sharing a hotel room with me weeks ago. (On the subject of Noah - he has had to cool his jets in Daleville for a day or two due to foot problems - hope you make it back out soon, bud, as I still have lots of advice to give you.) Although we climbed a lot, none of the climbs was super-long. Virginia was being kind to us. We paused for a water refill and lunch at a ranger station - so nice just to turn on a tap and not have to worry about filtering.

The day promised to be as forecast, sunny but quite windy. We both started off the hike with extra layers but shed them within the first half-hour as the climb out of Swift Run Gap warmed us up. After about an hour we began to notice that we were on a trail that was only blue-blazed, meaning that it wasn't the AT. I dropped my pack and backtracked to a shelter we'd passed but was unable to see where we'd gone wrong. We kept on going and rejoined the AT. After another half-hour we met a hiker coming towards us. I asked him if he was enjoying his southbound journey, and he looked puzzled and said he was a NOBO. Shebeast and I were actually heading back the way we'd already come. After two hours and twenty minutes of hiking, it turned out that we were only about half a mile from where we'd started. This was very dispiriting, as we actually had a schedule to keep to. In Shebeast's case, she was aiming to get to her truck, 22 miles away, and drive 5.5 hours home to North Carolina. In my case, I was aiming to be, by 2:30 or so, at a big campsite and recreational center 16 miles away called Big Meadows, where my wife Gayle would pick me up and drive me to Richmond, Virginia. (On Sunday, our daughter graduates from the University of Richmond.) The AT section in this area hugs the edges of the Skyline Drive and cell coverage was bad, so it wasn't until around 1pm that I managed to get a text off to Gayle warning her I'd be late. About an hour or so after we had begun hiking in the correct direction (and after spotting where we'd gone wrong at a trail intersection) Shebeast spotted a bear clawing a tree about 25 yards away from us off the trail. It eyed us for a minute, hid itself behind the tree and peeked at us, then ambled off up the ridge. Shebeast judged it to be a yearling male, about 100 pounds. My first sighting of a bear! It made the wasted loop we'd done worthwhile. We ploughed on, with the route often being relatively flat, which made a pleasant change, but with plenty of uphill to make sure we didn't lose our conditioning. We rolled into Big Meadows just before 4pm, and went into the Wayside restaurant where we had the famous blackberry milkshakes, after which I had a pulled pork sandwich. Gayle pulled up about 20 minutes later. She drove me to the shower facilities a mile away, and while I was making myself somewhat more fit to re-enter normal society, she drove Shebeast to her truck. So I'm going to take a break from trailjournals.com until I resume my hike, hopefully in four days' time, on Monday. Until then, happy trails!

After attending my daughter's graduation in Richmond, VA on Sunday (and the events preceding and following it), I was dropped off this morning by Bryan, our son's godfather, at Short Pump outside the city and driven the rest of the way to Big Meadows by a shuttle driver, Adam. He owns hostels in Waynesboro and Glasgow. One thing I want to do is give a big shout-out to Stu and Greg at REI. I am only going to shop at REI for camping gear from now on. They took back the Osprey Exos pack that had been killing me (straps were slipping, a shoulder strap's buckle broke and the pack was the wrong size for me anyway) and substituted a somewhat heavier Osprey Atmos 50-liter (the Exos was a 58) in a medium frame, free of charge. They replaced my practically sole-less Salomon boots with Salomon trail runners, free of charge. They could not have been more professional or customer-friendly. I bought: (1) new Leki poles, and am leaving my old ones for them to rehab for my son's hike with me; (2) a smaller, lighter 45-degree down sleeping bag and am sending my 25-degree bag home; (3) okay, luxury item, a 10-liter shower bag you can fill and hang from a branch to allow some degree of cleanliness which is difficult to achieve if all you have nearby is a spring or small stream; and (4) a waterproof bag to house my chain-mail bear-proof bag (but the mesh lets rain soak the contents). While off trail, I resupplied on food and sundry items at a Walmart. I had a haircut and beard trim, and a massage. I lounged around a lot and drank a lot of wine. I weighed myself and discovered I've lost 32 pounds since I started. I found the day's hiking very hard. Mostly this was due, I suspect, to a pack that weighed 45 pounds since it had about 17 pounds of food in it. (Note the use of the past tense. I indulged any hunger pangs I experienced during the day. I prepared pad Thai this evening. Those are significant load-shedding tactics.) But also, much of the AT today was rocky, especially the last ten miles, and it gets tedious picking one's way through rocks, especially going downhill, and makes for slow going. I was very glad to see the shelter appear. I pitched my tent at almost 9pm, in the dark. (It was also quite cold. A hiker told me that she had seen snow the previous day.) While I was rummaging around, deer were grazing just a few yards from me, their eyes reflecting the light from my headlamp, unblinkingly, tranquilly, amber jewels.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564102,"I treated myself to a leisurely start to the day, with the result that I didn't step on the trail until 9:31. I felt really strong and in good shape. I made good progress, especially as the path was far more walkable than the rock jambalaya we were faced with yesterday. My first goal was getting to the Elk Wallow Wayside, about seven miles away. There I had a cheeseburger with chili fries, a double-scoop blackberry ice cream cone, and a Dr Wham (local version of Dr Pepper). I continued on, as is my wont. Around 4pm, a SOBO told me he'd almost run into a big bear a few hundred yards earlier. I got to where he'd seen the bear. At first I felt a bit disappointed when I saw nothing, but just around the bend were three bear cubs. They scampered away over a hill but the trail curved around it and when I got further along I saw them again. Less than an hour later I was telling another SOBO, Glassman, about them. Seconds after I resumed hiking I saw another bear and was able to double back on the trail and catch Glassman before he had put his pack back on. The bear just looked at us and never moved. The reason was a tiny bear cub up in the tree beside her. He climbed down and they ambled off. I was very happy with my sightings. Shortly after the excitement, I passed a tent and heard someone call ""Hey Tipp!"" It was Smoky, with his girlfriend, Canine (why not 'The Bandit'? A missed opportunity). I ended up pitching my tent at a spot near a peak where three other hikers, Old School, Calves So Smooth, and Mustache Bandito, a fireman, were set up. I boiled water on their fire (saving precious propane) for my second pad Thai and listened to Calves' monologue about his drinking sprees in town. He is only 18 so what can you expect?

Some time during the night, in the light of the full moon, some animal came through the campsite, feet scrunching on the dead leaves. Probably deer. I got up to pee but it was with a certain reluctance and slight nervousness... I got on my way at 8:29. It was warmer than the previous day. Just beforehand, Smoky and Canine came through, he shirtless and she in a sports bra. They were chuffed because finally, just a few minutes earlier, they had seen a bear. I caught up to them later in the morning and passed them when they stopped at a shelter. They were planning on a resupply in Front Royal. As I hiked, I kept on pulling out my phone to check for cell coverage but with always the same result as for the last two days - nada. The trail here never really propels us up onto ridges where we are directly above towns and farms. When we are on ridges, we are surrounded by other ridges and forest, and any signs of civilization are too far away to drive a signal to us. It's quite frustrating for a dedicated journal-keeper like me. In the course of the morning the trail emerged from the Shenandoah National Park. Soon after, it emerged from the woods into open Meadows, and there were houses in the distance, and even right beside us with children's swing sets and other stuff we hikers don't need! Quite a few houses had distinctive ochre-colored roofs. The trail crossed a main road which led to Front Royal, and suddenly there were hikers all over the place, getting back on the trail or waiting for rides into town. I chatted to a few of them and then I ... continued on. I asked some workers closing a gate into a fenced-off area by the trail why the buildings in the area had the same style and color of roof. They said that it is because are part of a facility that runs a captive breeding program for non-US endangered species, housed on 5,000 acres and run by the Smithsonian Institute. I asked if I might expect to see elephants, and they laughed and said no, but that I might see cheetahs. Shortly after this the ankle bone on the outside of my right foot began to hurt as the low-rider top of my new shoe rubbed it. I padded the area with pages torn from a New Yorker, not to much avail. Then my knee started to ache. Then some tendon in that foot went postal on me. I was not a happy camper, to coin a phrase. It was a long day. I limped into Dick's Dome Shelter, crossing a creek right in front of the old shelter. I cooked my food in a newer shelter a few yards away from the old one, and retired to my tent. I have a headache. I am not a happy...oh, sorry, I said that already. As today marks the end of my eighth week on the trail, what milestones? Saw bear. Saw deer. Passed the 900-mile mark. Took in effect 4 zero days to see my daughter graduating from college. Got new boots, backpack, and poles. Confirmed a continued weight loss. I'm tired. Go away.

Within a few minutes rain was bucketing down, and a thunderstorm erupted. Given my recent experiences with setting up tent in the rain, the prospect of taking my tent down in the rain was very unappealing. In addition, I'd been considering the wisdom of hiking after the pain I'd suffered the previous day. It took very little to persuade me that I should zero in my tent - a new and somewhat decadent experience for me. With water and a privy close by, I was well sited. I had my Rolling Stone magazine to finish, and three New Yorkers, which would help lighten my load. And, in a major development, Verizon, which for the last few days hath taken away, decided to giveth. Or give. Whatever. I was able to update my trail journals, establish reliable contact with my wife, and with Lumberjack and the D.C. PHATs (sounds like a weird outré band, maybe playing country and western electronica?). So time passed quickly. The rain never let up for a minute, although its intensity varied. I cooked Idahoan potatoes in my tent, adding in some trailside onion or garlic (or maybe chives?) I'd harvested yesterday. I am down to just one bag of food at last - enough for about 3-4 days. Late in the day I heard from Noah. He had foot problems and decided to go to Charlottesville to visit Monticello while he rested from the trail. However he has taken the decision to end his AT journey and head home. I wish you all the best, my friend.

I seized the opportunity to pack up in the relatively dry conditions, although my tent and rain fly were spattered with mud from backsplash yesterday. I crossed the creek by the shelter. It was notably higher from all the rain. A rock shifted under me and I was lucky to stay upright, but at the cost of my left foot plunging in the water and getting my boot completely soaked. Before I'd even returned to the trail proper! I said words like ""Oh dear"" and ""That's a pity"". I had wadded up a few pages from a New Yorker I'd read to make a kind of collar to protect my ankle bone on my right foot. It actually worked, although I had to keep jamming it back in place in the boot. I got hiking on the trail at 6:26. The trail today was initially quite flat and I made good progress, despite the very muddy conditions (which several years of work as a child laborer slaving on an Irish farm had prepared me well for; I wished I had my old indestructible wellies on many times). I surprised several deer grazing in the mist. One came galloping around a bend in the trail, saw me and did a high jump into the bushes and was gone. I also disturbed some bird of prey perched on a fence post which took off with languorous beats of its wings. At around mile 9, I stopped in to a shelter to Leukotape a blister on my right foot and to use the privy. I met Cheap Sunglasses (see photo in photo library) on his way out. I caught up with him later on at a gap where my old buddy Lumberjack had done trail magic yesterday. He had scratched my name in the roadside gravel with an arrow pointing to a rock. Hidden under some leaves by the rock were a fresh supply of Leukotape (yes!) and a big can of draught Guinness (yes! yes!). What a guy! I hiked with Cheap Sunglasses most of the rest of the day. I occasionally let him talk. He's 60, from Florida, is a refrigeration engineer, and has hiked all his life. We talked about hiking food, sugar's bad effects, death, and other stuff. When he turned off for the Bear's Den Hostel, I was amazed to see that it was almost 5pm - the day had just flown by. When I'm on my own, I'm computing my speed, consulting my guide book, estimating when I'll arrive at my destination, checking my watch every 2.5 minutes, and time does not hurtle by like that. I had aimed to reach mile 1,007* before quitting for the day, and that was precisely what I did, after almost 13 hours of hiking.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564522,"Despite the forecast of heavy rain today, it was a delight to wake up, after the torrential rain during the night, to find only tree-rain falling. I was able to pack the wet fly and damp tent without dealing with rain also. A big mercy. I hit the trail at 7:21. (I'm very particular about noting the exact time. Some might call it something else.) I wanted to get to Harpers Ferry, 16.6 miles away, as soon as possible so that I could go to the ATC HQ there, check in at the hotel, shower, do laundry, and resupply at the outfitters. So I planned on minimal stopping, and packed my camera away. Much of the early part of the hike was in open woods, on level paths. A noise behind me at one point startled me; a deer had crossed the path just after I'd gone by. Either it hadn't seen me, or, more likely, it wasn't fussed by seeing another of those odd two-legged things. The deer would bite a few leaves from a low-hanging branch, and turn to look at me as it went munch, munch. Bite, look, munch. Bite, look, munch. This went on for some time. I moved closer and the routine stopped. We just looked at each other. I decided to move on and leave the animal in peace. Soon the trail became rocky and my pace slowed. Then came the mud, and the trail masquerading as a stream. My shoes squelched. I began to meet weekend hikers coming towards me. A slack-packing young woman, Clever Girl, caught up with me as I perused my AT guide. I'd met her yesterday also. Damn slack-packers. She went to the shelter nearby to check the register, and I told her I'd make it my mission not to let her catch me again (she didn't). And so it went, no big climbs or descents. My previously sensitive ankle bone, unprotected today by the New Yorker, didn't trouble me. I arrived in Harpers Ferry a full hour ahead of what I'd usually expect. Then things went wrong. I misread the map, thinking I was coming into the town from the north when I was doing so from the south. I got terribly confused. At one point I spoke to a shuttle driver and she said ""Hop on. I'm going to the Visitors' Center, but the ATC is right beside it."" The ride took us out of town and up a hill. 'Right beside' turned out to be a half-mile trek, and the building was not the ATC but a Tourist Information center. I was fit to be tied. My wet feet were beginning to blister, and the hour I'd saved was disappearing. I took the shuttle back down, glaring at the driver as I got on board. I eventually got to the ATC, where they took my photo for their album and gave me a thru-hiker badge to affix to my backpack, or anywhere that took my fancy. I trudged to the hotel, where Kathy the receptionist couldn't have been more friendly; she recalled the conversation she'd had with Gayle when she was making the reservation. After the delight of a shower, I bandaged up my fresh blisters with - what else? - Leukotape, and was just about presentable when Mark pulled into the car park. He was followed soon after by Ed and Peter. We all ride the Pan-Mass Challenge every August. It's a charity event that last year raised $47 million in one weekend of cycling for cancer research and treatment. (See http://pmc.org/RG0191 for more details.) We are part of a team called PHAT Tuesday. We have a lot of fun doing something with a serious purpose and seriously challenging - biking 192 miles in two days. Mark, Ed and Peter are in the D.C. area and came to resupply me, take me to the outfitters for other supplies, and treat me to dinner. I had to borrow Ed's jacket in the restaurant as lately I feel the cold more (less fat protecting me). Now I'm back in the hotel, have done my laundry and organized my food stocks (too much, as usual)...

This despite a meal out, and afterwards finishing off the container of cubed and candied sunflower/other seeds Mark had brought me, and having three oranges. I resisted the urge to eat something, but after several seconds gave up fighting it. I fished a two-pound summer sausage from my food bag, and cut a piece off the end. It was delicious. So was the next piece. In fact, I can honestly say that the whole thing was scrumptious. I went back to sleep. In the morning I enjoyed the Econo Lodge's breakfast of biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, and pork patties. I had more than one helping. I was a bit late getting hiking, and so relaxed that I failed to note the time I stepped in the trail. I crossed the bridge from Harpers Ferry and West Virginia into Maryland - my third state in as many days, and sixth overall. It was a warm and sunny day, but quite windy. There were lots of people out biking, walking dogs, and hiking. I met a thru-hiker called Rooster, who is part-sponsored by his employer, a nutrition company called Isagenix, and we hiked together for the several miles that were left to get us to Gathland State Park, with the eye-catching War Correspondents Monument. What was even more eye-catching was the sight of Vicki strolling towards us, and saying ""You must be !"" Vicki has been reading my journal, does trail magic, and had emailed me that she'd be there and would bring me lunch. I had an egg and cheese sandwich, brownies, fruit, and she forced me to have a French-style chocolate pastry. There were several other hikers there, and Tesla, an 18-year old who thru-hiked last year, and who was also doing trail magic. We eventually took our leave of Vicki, and waddled our way north. I was with Rooster, Walden (a hiker I'd met at Dick's Dome) and Sparky, a former engineer who also keeps a trail journal. We saw a big black rat snake which did not act at all friendly. We all ended up at Dahlgren Backpack Campground, which was amazing, with six gravel campsites, each with a picnic table and fireplace, and restrooms with toilet paper and hot showers. Even though I'd had a shower yesterday, I had another. Now this is living.

Others began to emerge from their tents and soon we were all on deck. I was taking down my tent when Cheap Sunglasses appeared, hiking from a stealth spot he'd camped on back on the trail despite the no-camping-except-on-designated-spots rule. Hats left shortly after that, and I followed, at 7:56. It was just warm enough that I could get away with wearing only one layer. I soon caught up to both CS and Hats. I stopped to climb up to see the Washington Monument, dedicated in 1827. Later Rooster caught up to me, and we hiked together for several miles until he stopped with Hats for a snack. The trail was fairly flat, although one or two sections were very rocky, and another section was wet and muddy. I made good time. I saw what I assume was a groundhog which waddled off the trail into a burrow before I could get a photo. I also saw the most exquisite little bird, a scarlet tanager, but my photos of it are dire, so I used one I lifted off a Web site. I opted to stop for the day at the Raven Rock shelter, and not to try to reach the next campsite which would have been another 5.7 miles. So unusually I finished in sunshine, had my pick of spots to pitch my tent on, had my dinner and was in my tent in daylight. Rooster appeared shortly after me nursing shin splints.

It's because Harpers Ferry is a conventional starting and ending point for people section-hiking or 'flip-flopping' (going from HF to say Katahdin, then flying south to do Springer to HF, or HF to Springer). During the day we met the foursome of Strider, Glim-Glom, Legs and Darwin whom I'd met on the wet, wet hike out of Daleville. They (apart from Glim-Glom) and several other young guys had done the one-day four-state challenge - starting in Virginia, and going on the AT through West Virginia and Maryland, and stopping once they entered Pennsylvania, a distance of about 42 miles. I was both glad to be done with another state (Maryland) and uneasy about the tough miles ahead, which are referred to as Rocksylvania on the trail. I hiked for an hour or so with Strider. But most of the day was spent with Rooster. He was a bit off his usual pace due to shin issues. He too was suffering, as I used to suffer, with backpack issues. (But my hips are healing, Leukotaped and with my poncho bunched up and serving as a soft buffer between my hip belt and my right hip until the healing process is complete. A good sign today was that my hip started itching a lot and no longer looks as impressively inflamed as before.) I actually felt great about my backpack today. I had other issues bothering me but I won't bore you with them. I was with Rooster because he was heading off trail to resupply and stay overnight in Fayetteville, and as I reviewed my food supply in the morning I'd decided that some replenishment was in order. So after almost 23 miles in the warm and dry conditions, but with a significant amount of rock-dodging already encountered, we arrived at the road into the town, started hitchhiking and got a lift almost immediately from a deputy sheriff, Sean, heading home. He dropped us off at the Scottish Inns motel where I shared the room with Rooster.  I showered and we headed for the restaurant across the street, where Kira served us broccoli soup (delicious), their 12-ounce burger, and a double-scoop ice cream cone. Then it was a short walk to Dollar General where Jess walked us around helping us find stuff. She's young, ex-military, and desperate to thru-hike. I did our joint laundry when we got back to our room. Very domestic.

We strolled back over to the Flamingo where I had a double breakfast of biscuits with beef gravy, and of huge pancakes with bacon, onion rings and other edibles, washed down with coffee and orange juice. Rooster was in awe of my capacity. Oh, and I ate all his toast too. I mean, why not? We hitched a lift back out to the trail with Trish, a self-described hippie. At the trail we met Soggy, who was there to see if any hikers wanted a lift. He told us that our hike would be easy. It was. For sure there were climbs, but nothing too steep. Rooster and I spent some time watching bees swarming hIgh in a pine tree. We soon caught up with Hats and Walden, and we all took a lunch break at the next shelter. Afterwards we split up, with Rooster and I setting a good pace. When he had to stop to adjust his backpack, I kept going and soon was crossing the AT midpoint (1,094.9 miles). There was a large brass band there to celebrate this achievement, and a crowd bigger than at Donald Trump's inauguration.

Shortly after that, I was overtaken by Butterfeet, an 18-year old who has been having Achilles issues and left the trail for 2 weeks to recover. We were all aiming for a store at Pine Grove where they have the half-gallon challenge - if you can eat that amount of ice cream, you get a small commemorative spoon. I fail to see the challenge. If it were one and a half gallons, okay, now we're talkin'. But a half? Anyway, it was all a damp squib as the store was closed. Much of the trail was level like the last couple of days but there were rocky stretches and in particular two 'rock mazes' where you were going up and over and among boulders, following arrows because just blazes would have been too uncertain. I was sweating like a pig. I made sure to drink and refill at many of the streams I crossed. There was only one snake today, but he was a big lad. I also noticed lots of small brown frogs. I had had notions of doing about 24 miles to get me through the town of Boiling Springs and camping beyond it, but in just that area camping is forbidden except at designated spots. So I hauled myself into Alec Kennedy Shelter at the 19-mile mark after 9 hours and 20 minutes of hiking. I had to go about 5 minutes beyond the shelter to find a level spot, but it's a beaut - by a brook, nobody else here, a good tree right by my tent for hanging my food bags. I took a shower (LOVE my shower bag), washed out my sweaty clothes and hung them on a line, and then took my food stuff up to the shelter to join Butterfeet and two female hikers for dinner.

For breakfast I had finished off the granola Peter had brought me, made by his daughter. It was very good. On the trail I could hear Rooster coming up the hill behind me, chatting to someone. He had camped further back on the trail below the shelter.  At the top of the hill I waited for them. I was expecting to see Walden with him, but it was his buddy Blueberry who had finally bridged the 120-mile gap caused when Blueberry had to leave the trail for a while, and who had now caught  up with him. We ambled along meadows and woods to reach the town of Boiling Springs. What a picturesque little town it is. Fishermen in waders were enjoying life in the river as only fishermen can. There was a big pond with geese and ducks, and many charming houses around it. Rooster made stops at an outfitters and a gas station as he tried to fix his pesky broken pole tips. I bought some limited supplies in a little convenience store. We crossed the street to Caffe 101 for breakfast. It wasn't as good as Flamingo, but it was adequate. I partially recharged my phone while we were there. We saw Walden who was heading the 0.9 miles out to a proper grocery store. It was getting very hot. Rather than wait for Rooster, Blueberry and I opted to hike on. On an uphill stretch I had my first fall in days, tripping over a small tree root, and landing solidly on my right knee. Blueberry helped me up - no easy task, considering I was carrying a lot of gear, including about 14 pounds of Snickers bars. I limped along for a while, but suggested he'd be better off going on at his own pace, and leaving me to mine. He fed me two Ibuprofen before he left. I began to notice that my left foot, which was doing more work now, was getting sore. Oh boy. Plus it was hot. I was sweating as only I can. My phone in my shorts pocket was wrapped in plastic so it was dry, but it was the only part of me that was unsoaked. Even the straps of my backpack were dripping. Crossing big wide Pennsylvanian fields in the full glare of a midday sun isn't as much fun as you might think. Then limping out onto a paved road and crossing an interstate - not fun. At least on the overpass there was a cooling breeze. I arrived at the ATC regional office, where there was a portaloo, fresh water, and a bench to sit at in the shade. Blueberry was there, as were Detour and Ishmael. Butterfeet and Odie showed up. I took off my sun shirt and tried to wash off the dirt I'd picked up when I fell. I ate a package of Pop-tarts. When I was heading out to rejoin the trail, Smoky was coming in, shirtless in the heat, displaying a torso covered in tattoos. When I commented on them, all he said was ""Yeah, I was in the military."" His girlfriend has gone home with Achilles problems so he is free to fly. I started the climb to the next shelter, Darlington. I was simply amazed. My knee was completely pain-free. I had stunning reserves of energy. I'm buying more Pop-tarts, I can tell you right now. I tore up the hill. Maybe my climb up McAfee Knob was equally impressive (hands up all those who remember that? Anyone?) But I couldn't believe it when I saw the sign for the shelter appear so soon. I kept going down the back of the mountain, heading for a campsite with water mentioned on Guthook. But it was a big disappointment - iffy spots for pitching a tent, and a dry streambed. Blueberry came along and we opted to tack on another three miles to a stream. The time passed quickly. There were several viable campsites when we got to the stream. That was good, as Rooster, Smoky, Van Grizzle, and Surly showed up too. I enjoyed another shower. It was cooler in the evening so being in my tent was less problematic.

It was a steep climb up but I pushed it and soon had teamed up with him. A little later Rooster latched onto us. The sky was overcast, very occasionally a light mist, and it was chilly if you weren't moving. AWOL's guidebook says ""trail very rocky from here [for next 6.2 miles]"". It hasn't said that about any other stretch of the AT that we've done, and there have been some mighty challenging rocky ridges in Virginia. So everyone had been a little apprehensive. We needn't have worried. There were rocks indeed, but nothing excessively scary. So we motored on for the town of Duncannon. On the descent I had to let the others forge ahead as my knee was protesting vigorously. One result was that I missed a turn - more of a swerve, really - off the old trail onto a newer trail. I was in the town when I saw Rooster and Blueberry behind me and they explained where I'd gone wrong. I went back the way they'd come until I hit the junction I'd missed, then turned around and hiked the new trail piece again, in the right direction. It's important to preserve the purity of one's AT! In Duncannon I rejoined the guys at a breakfast place, Goodies, where, like yesterday, I had a double breakfast. (Next time, a triple.) Smoky showed up, and Van Grizzle was also there. I charged my phone and updated my trail journal. I was almost the last to leave and hiked the rest of the day - 11 miles - on my own. The trail led out of town and across the broad Susquehanna. I dislike these stretches along highways. They are boring and noisy and I can't use my poles on their concrete or tarmac without hurting my right wrist, which has developed quite nasty carpal tunnel syndrome. During the afternoon I stopped to do a full water refill at an intermediate spring as there were no water sources for several miles after that, and the one at the destination shelter was described as being steeply downhill with 300 steps. It was a good move. With my food supply being fairly low, and my new backpack working so much better, the extra water weight was less troublesome than it normally would have been. I rolled into the shelter around 5:30. There were lots of people there, many of them weekend hikers. I was lucky to get the last decent spot for my tent.

This part of the AT continued to be fairly flat (less than 3,000 feet of climbing today) and the rockiness diminished substantially, with some delightfully easy stretches of trail. I overtook a few NOBOs and saw quite a few SOBOs. I concentrated on a steady pace, enjoying my iPod (it was a big Billy Joel day, but some Rolling Stones too). My knee was fine, but my right little toe, which I'd Leukotaped last night, was very sore, as was my right wrist. So I played it defensively, doing barely my 2mph, and trying to place my right foot only on spaces between rocks; that wasn't always possible. I stopped only briefly for food. I had enough water left from yesterday (1.5 liters) to see me through most of the day. I passed two shelters before I went dry, and refilled 4 liters at a stream. Then it was a mile up to the top of Second Mountain looking for a spot to camp. I didn't find one until I was almost all the way down the far side.

It tells me about notable features along the route, distances, elevation, water sources, shelters, where to leave the trail to get to the nearest town, shuttle services, hostels, hotels, shops and so on. I also have Guthook, a GPS app for the AT that tells me exactly where I am on the trail, and provides some of the same data as the AT Guide; I find it most valuable when I am tired towards day's end and want to be sure I don't overshoot a water source or want to avoid the despair of the 'false summit'.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565633,"I had forgotten to sew up an unraveling compression sleeve last night, so taking care of that set me back a little this morning. I got onto the trail at 7:43. The day was cloudy and cool. A slight fog shrouded the woods and concealed the views. It eventually turned to rain. I hit trail magic almost immediately- somebody had left a case of Coca-Cola cans at a road crossing. I put one in a hip belt pocket to have later. The hike today veered from a stretch of about three miles of the flattest, widest, and straightest path I've encountered on the AT, to utter boulder bedlam, where it was hard to discern what the path was, and taking one's eyes off the rocks courted disaster. Of course, I fell, but not because of a normal trip and fall. No sirree, no plain Jane fall for me. There was one section where I followed the ostensible path, only to find I'd gone astray by a few yards and had to backtrack. Near the error point, there was a substantial rotting log which I felt would be better employed blocking the avenue I'd gone down and helping others stay on the trail. A public-spirited action on my part. In moving the log, I slipped on a rock and landed on my side. Result: dirt on my left sleeve; grazes on my forearm; but waaah! the can of Coke burst open and most of it spilled out of the belt pocket before I could slurp it up. What a disaster. But shortly afterwards I came up to a road crossing, singing ""Little Musgrave"" lustily. An elderly man in a bright red plaid shirt asked ""Are you hungry?"" I said ""I'm a thru-hiker - I'm always hungry"". He opened up the car boot to reveal boxes of provisions - soft drinks, cheese, trail mixes of different sorts, energy bars, ramen. He loaded me up while I munched and we chatted - he about his Scottish, Welsh and English roots, and me about my Irish background. His name is Donald Gauntlett and he is 77. Unfortunately it started to rain again and we went our separate ways. The rest of my day was spent managing the tedium and pain of navigating miles of rocks. I hate rocks. My ""trail runner"" shoes were a bit too light for the task and my feet began to feel bruised. I had intended to do up to 23 miles, but when I saw a built-up tent pad by a river at mile 20, I threw in the towel. While I was getting water, Rooster and Blueberry showed up. They tried to find a spot near me but failed and decided to hike up the hill to another campsite. I had a big meal, and then a shower - a bit too chilly this time. But it's always nice afterwards to feel so clean.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565793,"So here I am in a hotel bar in the town of Hamburg, PA. It's late, and I'm on my fourth beer. My buddies have sensibly headed to bed, but I have my trail journal to do. Last night was a minor disaster. One of the last things I usually do is set up my three-liter Hydrapak, which involves dropping an electrolyte tablet into it, and putting it outside my tent in one of the vestibules, threading the tube back in through the zipper so that I can sip on it as I'm reading or journaling. I often finish the entire thing before I turn in for the night. (Yes, I know the inevitable question, but the truth is I have fantastic bladder capacity and have only once needed to head out into the cold world to pee.) Well, in the midst of opening up the wretched Hydrapak, it slipped out of my grasp and water flooded the tent. I was on my mattress, an island in the sea. Once again, I said words like ""Ooh, such rotten luck"", and ""Darn!"" And possibly others too. I spent ages mopping up and squeezing bandanas out in the vestibules. I was not happy. But moving on. I actually slept well. I was on the trail at precisely 7am. Not 6:59. Not 7:01. Still Bill had passed by at 6:47. (He was the guy Shebeast and I met when we went horribly wrong on the trail in the Shenandoahs and who convinced us we were heading south, not north.) I was powering up the hill, and caught him in jigging time, as we say in Ireland. I was racing to catch Rooster and Blueberry, as I knew that if I could catch their train, I'd make it to town about two hours faster than on my own. After 80 minutes of practically racing along the trail, I caught them as they were talking at a road crossing to Craig, a hiker who was dropping off a thru-hiker to the trailhead. It gave me a chance to take off my jacket and sun-shirt as I was definitely warm and there was no sun. It was just as well I caught them when I did, as the trail reverted to extreme rockiness, in which I move slowly. Still, we were doing 3mph, no frivolous stops. There was little to photograph and few hikers to chat to. So we made excellent time, although I was struggling to keep up. We reached the highway to Hamburg around 2pm and ended up walking the two miles or so to town. Our first stop was a Chinese buffet. For $12 we had all we could eat. Blueberry generously paid for our meals. I got very cold and had to put on a jacket. I've noticed that this happens a lot with me lately. I went from there to Walmart to resupply. In particular I bought a foam pad to place on camping seats like tree-trunks, rocks, etc. as my butt feels the hard surfaces more poignantly than before. I also bought, like, ten Snickers. And a big can of turmeric. Hey, I'm into healthy eating, what can I say? As I struggled to pack all the stuff into my backpack outside Walmart, a young man asked me if I needed a lift. Austin ""Wiki"" Thompson, a freshman at a nearby college of technology, he hiked a big chunk of the trail last year. In the hotel, a Microtel, I was impressed with my room. I had a shower, washed out my tent, did my laundry (and Rooster's and Blueberry's, but then again they gave me protein bars, gels, shakes, etc as they both had resupplied by maildrop and were over-supplied), unpacked all my new food from its containers and re-packed it, and went down to the bar for some dinner. At the bar I sat with Still Bill and Blueberry. The bar staff are all that are left now. Time for bed.

While Rooster, Blueberry and I were having breakfast with a young hiker called Turk, another young hiker, Sean ""Antman"" Daly came up and offered to have his visiting parents drive us to the trailhead. Mr Daly, a keen turkey hunter, dropped us off at 8:15, and Mrs Daly provided us with sandwiches for trail snacks. I tried to keep up with Rooster and Blueberry but after an hour I had to admit defeat and drop back to my own pace. I made good progress and around midday was overtaken by Honey Badger, a 25-year old ironworker from Buffalo, NY, who started on March 4, and we hiked together for the rest of the day. We completed 26 miles and ended up camping, with the permission of Ken, who I think is the owner, on the lawn at the back of a restaurant where we had hoped to eat, but it was closed. Instead we both cooked loads of ramen. I heard from Rooster that he had ended up about 2 miles further along the trail and had lost track of where Blueberry is.

Honey Badger and I returned to the trail at 8:22. The section we were heading into is infamous as it is very rocky. There is one section, a ridge called Knife Edge. It's not very long, but the rocks are hard to navigate and in the wind and rain I made heavy going of it. I had already fallen hard on a dead level piece of trail - what I took to be a little pile of leaves contained a protruding rock which tripped me and I landed on another small rock with my left thigh. Very painful. So as I worked my way along Knife Edge I was already in pain. I fell three times on the ridge. I snapped the lower section of one of my poles but was able to push the stub with the crucial carbide tip into the pole so it was a bit shorter but functional. In a subsequent fall I bent but did not break the same pole. The trail never ceased to be rocky. Boulder fields occurred several times. I had lost my bottle as we say in Ireland so my progress was slow. Honey Badger was patient and stayed with me. We met Rooster at a shelter and he joined us for the rest of the day. We decided to eat a late lunch in Palmerton, at Bert's. The owner shuttled us to and from town. The whole exercise cost us two hours. When we arrived at Berts we met Blueberry. He has decided to quit the AT. He was clearly very upset and we were all sad for him too. We had a horrible climb out of that area, scrambling up a virtual cliff. By the time we reached our goal darkness had fallen and we had been using our headlamps for about half an hour. I am tired, have a badly bruised thigh, very sore left foot (heel and arch) and sundry other aches and pains. We have one more big hike tomorrow to get us within one mile of the New Jersey border. I for one will not be sad to see the last of the rocks of Pennsylvania.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566251,"We had camped last night at a nondescript site a little off the trail, our choice dictated by our need to do close to 25 miles. We had found a young woman, Laken, and her dog already camped there, which had made it hard for two more tents to squeeze in. Rooster made the sacrifice and took a spot that was rooty and uneven. We all stuck to plan and were hiking by 7:04. It had rained just as we all woke up, but the rest of the day was mainly sunny. The day's profile was as flat as it comes on the AT, apart from a drop into and climb out of Wind Gap, and the final long descent. There was almost no respite from the rocks. In fact, we went over a few small boulder fields, a ridge called Wolf Rocks which was quite mild, and contended with rocks generally on the trail. We started out at a 3mph pace. I was able to hang onto the back of the bunch for over three hours, but then had to admit that the slight sense of discomfort in my right leg had changed into some full-blown complaint like shin splints, and I said goodbye to the other two and let them vanish over a hill. Shortly afterwards I saw them getting into a car at Wind Gap; they said they were being given a lift to a convenience store and asked if I wanted to join them, but I declined. They offered to bring me anything I needed and I asked for a can of Coke. It took them almost 2 hours to reappear behind me on the trail. This time, when they disappeared, it was for good. I stopped to enjoy the Coke and some trail mix for lunch. My sore shin continued to bedevil me, but I plowed on. At one point, as I climbed one of the last ascents before the final descent into the town of Delaware Water Gap, I had to apply Leukotape to a blistering toe. The descent, which had been described to us as ""difficult""; ""a sheer cliff""; ""almost straight up"", turned out to be no such thing luckily and was rocky but pleasant compared to many of the stretches of the trail I had encountered in the last week. When I finally emerged in the little town, I'd been hiking for over 13 hours and covered 26.2 miles. I called the golf club where I was to stay for the night and learned to my horror that it was a further mile and a half away from the end of the trail. Luckily, the receptionist whom I was speaking to sensed my plight and sent a car to pick me up. After the joy of a shower I went downstairs to the golf club patio and got the biggest pulled pork sandwich I could persuade the staff to make for me. I also had a second plate of side dishes such as pasta, mashed potatoes and more pasta.Tomorrow I will be going off the trail for a trip home; I will be back in the US and hopefully on the trail by June 2.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567183,"This morning I bade yet another farewell to my wife and caught a flight back into the US. (When I told the rather dour INS officer that I'd be hiking the AT, she asked me how much money I was taking with me. I probably looked fairly indigent in my t-shirt, hiking pants and boots, with my backpack and a plastic shopping bag for carry-on stuff.) From JFK I took the AirTrain to Jamaica and then the subway to the Port Authority bus station, and from there it was a couple of hours' ride back to Delaware Water Gap. I got a lift into the town and walked back up the road to where I'd cached my gas canisters. After retrieving them, I was on the trail by 3:41. It was a beautiful day for hiking - sunny, breezy, low humidity. I crossed the state line from Pennsylvania to New Jersey after only 0.6 miles of hiking. It was painted in the middle of a long bridge over the Delaware. While I was taking a selfie, a truck roared by and blew my hat off. It could easily have ended up on the interstate or over the parapet into the river, but it didn't. Shortly after this, I passed the 1,300-mile point. The terrain promised to be an improvement over Pennsylvania but was a let-down, as the rocks re-emerged and slowed me down. I'm monitoring my feet very carefully as I'm worried about plantar fasciitis in both. But maybe it's something else. While I was home, my erstwhile tennis buddy Rob gave me a foot support designed to alleviate plantar fasciitis and I am hoping that using that and going carefully through the rocky stretches will save me from a foot meltdown. (Rob, since you said you're too busy to read my journal, I don't even need to thank you for your gift. So there.) It being a Friday afternoon, there were lots of day- and section-hikers on the trail. I ran into an ATC ridge runner, Matt, who is in his second week of work. He thru-hiked last year. He knows Nick, the ridge runner I met in both Georgia and PA. For a mile or so, the trail ran along the edge of a mountain lake, Sunfish Pond. It was so tranquil and I felt like I had it all to myself. Then a big old beaver came paddling along. He came right in beside me, and stayed with me as I hiked the next hundred yards or so. Another friendly critter, like Snakey or that bunny outside Atkins. I aimed to finish today at a campsite on top of a ridge but the spot was taken when I got there. I continued on for just a couple of hundred yards and found a lovely spot on the ridge, among the trees. The sunset was worthy of a Turner painting. It feels like I'm back in NC or Tennessee! I like this camping alone business!
And just a note to any of my PHAT Tuesday teammates who may be following my journals: I went out for a one-hour ride while I was home. I found the bike felt bigger. I felt tired even on the flats and slight uphills. But oddly enough, when I tried Knapton Hill, a pretty fierce climb by local standards, I did it 21 seconds faster than my standard time (3 minutes). All the pounds I've shed no doubt helped. So go figure. I still have no idea how I'll do on the PMC, but I'll be lining up with you.

Although the terrain featured some rockless stretches, the overall theme today continued á la Pennsylvanien, with enough rocks torturing us for all but the most dedicated ATC sadist. Alleviating the angst were some lovely views to both the west and east. To the west were 10, 20, maybe 30 miles of forested low hills and valleys. To the east was farmland and lakes. The sun shone but I didn't bother with a hat or sunscreen as for most of the day I was in the 'green tunnel' and the sun did not penetrate. Around midday I was overtaken by the Danish AT team of Beetle and Friendly Ghost, whom I last saw in The Captain's Place way back in southern Virginia. Friendly Ghost is a violinist and was quick to point out that the dislocated finger injury I sustained on The Priest would have put an end to his career. Beetle has lost even more weight. After we chatted for a while, they took off but I caught up to them again when they stopped for some trail magic. A trail angel called Marilyn had some drinks, popcorn and snack bars available for thru-hikers and we chatted to her for a while. I plodded on, meeting many day and section hikers, and being overtaken by one or two thru-hikers. A big ol' turkey walked in front of me quite unperturbed. I had heard about a restaurant close to the trail near my 20-mile mark, and when I reached that point I walked to it. It is called Gyp's Tavern, and a friendlier place would be hard to find. I ordered a burger and a bratwurst, charged my electrical gear, and when I was leaving, filled my Hydrapak with their lemonade at no extra cost. I chatted to two of the customers beside me at the bar, Ray and Patty. Ray knew Marsh & McLennan, my former employers. He said that Roger, one of his colleagues at Johansson, a maker of electrical components, had lost his wife in 9/11, and that she had been an employee of Marsh. It turned out that she was Angela Kyte, whom I had known and who had even been to our house for dinner on one occasion. We continued to chat about, inter alia, languages (who knew that I would be hearing about the Finnish language?), Acadia, and Irish folk music, which Ray was very familiar with. I spent some time talking to two bikers outside the bar who were fascinated by the AT. Bill, the young owner of the bar, and a former Air Force pilot, turned out to be a huge U2 fan. He has attended 115 of their concerts, starting when he was 12, and will be attending five of the upcoming Joshua Tree Tour concerts. Never mind that he has met 'the boys' - yerra, he's even met Dave Fanning! I learned this while he was driving me to the local grocery store in his beautifully-restored vintage car (and yes, I can't remember what make, model, year it was, and I have no photo...), where he did most of the shopping for me, as he seemed to be able to locate tortillas, packets of tuna, and the like quicker than me. All in all it's no wonder that I got back to the trail in darkness, lost my way and had to navigate back to the trail using Guthook's GPS guidance. As soon as I could find a semi-level spot I pitched my tent. At least I didn't have to cook food.

I felt really strong for the first two hours, but reverted to the new norm of two mph for most of the rest of the day. I dropped in at the first shelter after my campsite to use the privy, and met the father-daughter team of Grits and Treeline. I had run into them yesterday as they were leaving the tavern along with Friendly Ghost and Beetle. I last saw them somewhere in Virginia. They were still packing up when I left the shelter, but they passed me later in the day. So did several others. I think I have partially lost my ""trail legs"" while I was off the trail.It started to rain around midday and continued to do so up to around 4 PM. By then, I was about 3 miles from my destination – the Murray shelter at around mile 1,343. It's not really a shelter; it is more like a large room with a door. There is a privy and shower facilities on the 85-acre property. The door was locked when I arrived but another hiker emerged from the woods as I was setting up my tent on the porch. He turned out to be the owner, Jim Murray, and mentioned that he had closed the facility, but was happy for me to use it for the night. We went out to dinner at a local restaurant, where I did my usual thing of having two main courses. Jim is 80, through hiked the AT in I think 1989, and looks much younger than he is. He bears more than a passing resemblance in looks and voice to Al Pacino. He hikes a lot, partly to help him in his ongoing rehabilitation from a horrific car accident in which he was a passenger, and in which his right hand was severed and had to be surgically reattached. But he is a very good-humored individual, and we enjoyed each other's company. He dropped me back to the shelter, with instructions that I should keep all food inside and the door closed because of the 600 pound bear that frequents the area. I thought about it, and decided to comply.It has started to rain again. And as I was writing this, I discovered a tick on my right arm. I'm a real AT hiker.

Light poured in through the big picture window that gave out on a view of the rolling lawn and woods beyond. It was hard to leave. I put off the moment by calling my friend Rich to work out a pickup place and time tomorrow. But eventually I had to pack and go. It was warm but overcast. I felt so at peace in the tranquil setting and wildly alone. I did a couple of 360 turns with my arms extended, poles in hands, just in a kind of rapture, a minor whirling dervish. When, at the unusually late time of 8:46, I stepped on the trail again, I had an upbeat track from the Bond album 'Born' playing on my iPod. It all fit.I charged along the trail. There was a very long section of boardwalk through a swampy area that was easily the longest such that I've encountered to date on the AT. There were to be several of them during the day. I ran into Friendly Ghost and Beetle (henceforth, ""the Danes"") and we hiked together for the whole day. We caught up with Grits and Treeline (father/daughter) and today I found I was able to keep up with all of them, except for Friendly Ghost when he was powering up the very steep 750 feet of the 'Stairway to Heaven'.The trail was delightful - flat and few rocks, although there were several very muddy stretches thanks to the rain on Sunday. I saw several Eastern red-spotted newts, including one that was barely 2"" long, a turtle, and a gorgeous yellow and black garter snake on the Stairway. There were several trail magic stations today where people had left coolers of goodies for hikers.When we came to the path for Wawayanda Shelter, I went in while the others carried on for the nearby Warwick Motel where five of them were going to share a room. I got one of the best spots in ages at a shelter - flat, on my own, far enough away from the shelter itself but close enough to the bear box and the privy. For water I had to hike 0.3 miles to a spigot at the Wawayanda State Park. Whistler and Stretch were there. They've been taking it easy, which is why I've caught them. I filled my containers including my shower bag, and lugged them back to the shelter. I had my evening meal outside the shelter with Nople and Frodo, two young men from Cincinnati who are taking breaks from school, washed my socks and shirt and hung them out with no real hope that they would dry in the heavy humidity. I took a shower and that was a challenge in the cool of the evening. It's now pouring rain, but at least it held off all day.

It rained all night but eased off around 8. I was able to pack up the tent in fairly dry conditions, with just the rain fly being wet - which of course makes it heavier. I got on the trail by 9:09. Today was easily the most technically difficult day so far on the AT, with three sections of rocks that demanded care, some risk-taking, and abandoning the use of poles so as to use hands to grab onto rocks and haul oneself up. I think I've seen up until today maybe two places where the AT offers an alternative route for those leery of rocks and a little danger. Today, there were at least two and possibly three 'blue-blazed' escape routes for the faint-hearted. On one very difficult vertical, the ATC sadists had recognized the impossibility of the ascent and had inserted rebar steps and handholds.
Just before 11, I crossed the state line into New York. New Jersey has been fun, with rounded rocks, lots of stretches with no rocks, and a generally kinder, gentler attitude to hikers than that Great Satan of a state, Pennsylvania (may its name be forever reviled, yea even unto the seventh generation, or at least until say 2019. Cursed be he who utters its name in my presence. Henceforth it is to be referred to as Pxxxxxxxxxxa, which is probably a common Basque name, likely pronounced 'Pisha'. Pisha it shall be.) By 11 the rain had re-started, which only made things even more exciting, especially when you factor in the lack of tread on my shoes. I got onto one stretch of smooth rock, roughly 20 feet from top to bottom, tilted at a 30-degree angle (the rock, you idiot, not me), and my feet started to slide. I was jabbing frantically at the rock with my poles to no avail, did a complete 360, and ended up sliding-running down the last ten feet. Adrenaline rush!
The rain stopped around 2pm, and shortly after that I was up on top of a long stretch of rocks known as the Pinnacles, with ravens nesting on the sheer sides. They are so used to hikers going by that they don't move until you are about six feet from them. I even came upon a big turkey barreling along the top of some rocks. He rushed away from me.
The rain and gloomy overcast conditions had created the perfect environment for the little orange newts, and there were tons of them. Now I play a game where I try to see how many of them I can squish underfoot in any 10-minute period. Getting two with one footstep counts as four.
During the day I hiked alone, apart from brief spells when 'the kids' would overtake me and vanish - Nople and his friend Frodo, for example. I caught up with Whistler and Stretch, and we leapfrogged each other during the course of the day. I also met an Israeli, Rock Spider, who was moving fairly slowly on the rocks, and his younger US buddy Thoreau.
My goal today was to get to the intersection with West Mombasha Road by 5. I was a bit late - 5:02 - but so was my old friend Rich, who showed up in his car at 5:03, and whisked me off to his house, stopping along the way to help me get a few supplies at a grocery store. He discreetly opened the sun-roof after I'd been in the car a few minutes. He and his wife Lori took me to dinner (after I'd had a long shower). I had a rack-and-a-half of BBQd ribs, and lots of other food too. My hosts looked on in some amusement as I methodically ensured that no food on the table went to waste. Back at the house, I tried to do my trail journal, but that was a total failure, as my phone had gotten wet during the day and typing was impossible. 
Now really, you didn't believe that I'd squish cute little newts, didya?

Around 7:30, Rich took me to a diner where I had a big omelette and lots of coffee. Then he dropped me back to Mombasha. I hope to see him again in Vermont. Straight away, on entering the woods on the far side of the road, there was a stretch of rocks reminiscent of Pisha*. But it was just New York pulling our legs, as it only lasted twenty yards. Far more upsetting were some stretches of rock that clearly had been transported at great cost from Pisha just to remind us of what we'd been generally spared. I found the climbs easy. My trail legs are definitely back, and that plantars issue, while not history, doesn't seem to be getting worse.
I ran into Bald Eagle for the first time. Like me, he does a trail journal. He did about half of the AT last year and is back finishing it off. His wife picks him up from the trail every evening. I enjoyed our chats, as we met several times during the day. I also met Ten Steps, whose wife Marilyn provided trail magic a few days ago; he was with Rocketman. I met Nople and many others. 
Everybody was looking forward to the Lemon Squeezer, a tight crack in the rocks, reminiscent of the approach to Petra in Jordan, which featured in one of the Raiders of the Lost Ark movies. As it turned out, the real show-stopper was a rock face immediately after the Lemon Squeezer, which put everything technical I'd experienced yesterday in the shade. There was a blue-blazed 'Easy Way' around it. I took three attempts before I finally managed to haul myself and backpack up and over. I had to abandon my usual rule of always having three secure contact points with the rock while moving to a fourth.
Having suffered through that hard rock-scaling, I sat down and called REI and ordered a new pair of boots, to be delivered to a post office a few days ahead.
The terrain after that was beautiful and very different from anything we'd seen on the AT before. It was like an English park as seen on 'Downton Abbey', with a rolling green landscape and a light scattering of trees. In the late afternoon I was passing by Fingerboard shelter, where there has recently been some bear activity, and I ran into two day hikers who were all excited that a few minutes earlier they had seen a mother bear and three cubs on a trail that intersects with the AT. I was tempted to drop my pack and go look. But with the delays due to rock-climbing and boot-ordering, I was anxious to keep moving. This became very necessary when I saw a text from Rich noting that I'd left my groundsheet in his garage. We arranged for him to drop it to me early tomorrow at a road crossing, so I opted to camp right by that crossing. But to reach it, I had to hike for an hour or so in the dark. It was just after ten when I pitched my tent, but the trail had been so well blazed that even with having to rely on a headlamp, I didn't find the going challenging. Along the way I'd been treated to the sight of the New York City skyline some 52 miles away, and the Hudson River much closer to me.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568056,"Exactly as arranged, Rich showed up at 7:30 with my groundsheet and also with a bottle of Dr Pepper and two Snickers bars. He knows his man.
By 7:56, I was on the trail, climbing Bear Mountain to the Perkins Memorial Tower. It was a pleasant, sunny day. There were crowds of kids from various schools and tourists generally on the mountain; Nick, a kid from a school called Franklin, was carrying a bag of trail magic and gave me a granola bar.
At the summit, things got a little disconcerting for me. I began meeting a lot of my NOBO friends coming towards me. Somehow, I was going south. I had missed a crucial fork in the trail, and had kept going up and around the mountain until I'd picked up the blazes from the trail as it now descended the mountain, but thought it was... oh, never mind. Look, I messed up, hiked back down and back up to claim the missing miles, and set myself back over two hours.
In the course of this yo-yoing, I met a slew of trailmates - Butterfeet, Rock Spider, Thoreau, Shivers and Shivers' Dad, Nople and Frodo, Tough Broad and Bear Sweats (don't ask). I caught up with Shivers and her dad and we hiked together for a couple of miles to the Trailside Museum and zoo, where the official trail actually goes through the zoo. The lowest point on the AT (120 feet) is in front of the bear cage. One of the bears was relaxing in a hammock. I had a couple of ice cream bars from a vending machine, and left the zoo to cross the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson. The guide book says it's a half mile across. I got talking to a bird-watcher on the walkway, who pointed out a peregrine falcon flying overhead.
There was a fairly stiff climb out of the river gorge. About five miles on, I came to a road crossing with a deli nearby. At the picnic table out front there was the inevitable bunch of hikers guzzling food. I stopped for a burger and fries with a giant bottle of Dr Pepper. (It's got the word 'Doctor' in it so it must be healthy, right?) I was determined to stick to my original goal of doing 17.8 miles to reach a site by a stream. When I got there at dusk (8:15), I found Tough Broad and Bear Sweats camped there. (TB got her name because of an incident on a hike where she fell and started complaining of pain from a pulled leg muscle. Dozens of miles later, she was  X-rayed and was found to have a broken femur. She has an impressive 8-inch scar from the subsequent operation.) It was pitch dark long before I set up my tent, filled my water containers, etc. I didn't feel like eating anything, other than Rich's Snickers bars, but that was more from a sense of obligation, as you can imagine. My phone, which had been sulking ever since it got wet two days ago, finally allowed me to start updating my journal, and I managed two days' worth before I called it quits at 1:30. What a day.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568084,"Mr Consistency, I was on the trail by 7:56. The day was fairly uneventful. It was coolish to begin with, but warmed up and was sunny for long spells. I met very few people all day, but I enjoyed a chat with a trail maintainer, Peter, who handles a three-mile stretch near his home. I relished the rolling and often very foot-friendly trail. I saw a couple of snakes. I felt fatigued from early on, possibly because I've had two late hiking days in a row and inadequate sleep. At around 5:15 I hit US 52, and a few hundred yards up that road was a deli and a pizzeria. I had intended to live off the food in my pack, but I couldn't resist a block of horseradish-flavored cheese, which I ate with a box of wheat thins and a liter of milk. And later I succumbed and had me two of them thar slices of pizza. I chatted with other hikers who were camping nearby and charging their phones at an outlet behind the deli, but I set up on the lawn right behind the deli and was asleep by 11 after getting another day's journal done.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568183,"It had been a very dewy night and the inside and outside of my tent were as wet as if it had been raining. After I struck camp I went into the deli and had a big bacon and cheese sandwich. I ordered a ham sandwich to go for lunch. While I was waiting for my orders to be prepared, I chatted to a young policeman in 'police casual' (dark t-shirt and pants) who was heading to training school with his canine unit. When he left, another customer, who announced himself as a member of the AHS (which I think is the American Historical Society) came up to me to enquire if I'd seen any cairns on the trail. He told me about the theory that certain Native American tribes believe the spirits of their ancestors live below ground in aquifers and underground rivers, and that they were able through dowsing to map the courses of ground water, marking them with these cairns. Interesting stuff you hear when you're in line at the deli.
I only got on the trail at 8:10. I had a very easy day ahead of me, with no big climbs or descents. (Look, I know I've said it before, but god, I love New York!) The weather was supposed to be warm, and it was. But here's the thing: you cross a field, and you have to put on your dorky hat. You sweat. You put on your sweatband. Then you re-enter the woods, and the perceived temperature drops twenty degrees. You have to shed the hat and sweatband. I passed lakes and ponds, walked along hundreds of yards of boardwalks across swamps, and noted with increasing irritation the growing number of mosquitoes and flies. I may have to break out the headnet soon; I've carried it from Georgia.
About halfway into my hike I caught up with two hikers having a chat, a NOBO and a SOBO. The SOBO passed me, and when I said ""Good afternoon"", the NOBO said ""?"". It turns out that he reads my trail journal, and knew I was nearby, so when he heard my ""brogue"" he guessed it might be me. His trail name is Bri-Face, a name given him by one of his daughters. A former Bear Stearns employee who lives in Yonkers, he now teaches mathematics to special needs students in Bronxville School. He was born just a few months before me, in Feb 1958. So as my elder, he commanded my respect. He was out doing a day hike. We had lunch together, and hiked together. We saw the magnificent Dover Oak, the largest tree on the trail. When we got to where he'd parked his car,  I slugged down two Cokes, as I'd run out of water. He pointed me towards a nursery just 100 yards further on. There I was able to water up. The owner, a lady whose name I forgot to ask, has a son-in-law from Cork, so we had a laugh as I mimicked the Cork accent. I found the last 5.5 miles of the day very easy. I knew the next shelter had non-potable water, so I filled my Hydrapak at a stream. At the shelter, which is right on the trail, I had to pitch my tent on a sloping patch of ground, but it worked out fine. I was right beside Will and Denise, a cabinetmaker and teacher respectively, from NY. They were super-friendly, and we all had discreet laughs at the antics of a young couple who were spending hours chopping wood - they had brought an axe with them. Butterfeet joined us while I was having dinner at their luxurious tent pad, as they reclined like royalty in their portable chairs. He had done 25 miles, despite all his troubles with overdoing the miles and having had to get off the trail as a result. Denise said that Will was a snorer and apologized in advance. But I had a great night's sleep and heard no snoring. I was so tired I could not stay awake to do my journal as I normally do.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568306,"I had a late start today as I took the time to do my trail journal for yesterday. As a result I left at 8:31. It was already quite warm and humid. 1.2 miles later I was crossing into Connecticut. I was genuinely sorry to be leaving the relatively easy and sometimes challenging (but fun) terrain that NY had served up. Today, although there were no killer climbs, there were lots of smaller ones, and they added up to 4,300 feet of ascents. I took it easy. Most thru-hikers get faster and do more miles as they progress on the AT. I'm one of those who is slowing down. I'm happy that I will reach Katahdin by or just before July 23 if I do 18-mile days. I'd love to try for one 30-mile day, though, just for the bragging rights. Speaking of Katahdin, it's interesting how my mental compass has begun to switch from having a southern orientation to a northern one. I still think in terms of miles done, but am finding myself slowly shifting to thinking of how many miles are left to do (as of tonight, 715.5). My former spinning instructor, Adam Melvin, did three weeks on the AT from Harpers Ferry to Bear Mountain. He described the AT to me as being 'brutal'. I prefer to think of it as grueling. It has the capacity to wear you down. I am pleased when I hear experienced hikers describing the AT as being the toughest hike in the US. I'd hate to think I was doing some namby-pamby beginners' trail. The first half of today's hike I was alone. It was very pretty, running alongside a river, and with lovely easy lengths of trail. But with any upwards incline, I was sweating profusely. At one point, I took off my sunshirt and rinsed it in the river. It felt good to put it back on, cold. For part of the hike around midday, I was passing through an area destroyed by a careless hiker's fire. I met Mike, a young ATC ridge runner. In the afternoon, I ran into Butterfeet a couple of times, and persuaded him to tuck in behind me and adopt my pace. We had  about ten miles to do to reach the shelter we planned to overnight at, and being together makes the time pass more easily. We noted the profusion of frogs on the trail; saw a couple of tiny garter snakes and 1,456 chipmunks; and one of us laughed when the other, thanks to his worn, treadless boots that he is casting aside tomorrow when he picks up his shiny new Salomons, slid out of control down a large, sloped, smooth rock and vanished over the edge in a tangle of tree branches, trekking poles, and assorted shrubbery. Luckily the drop off the edge was about three feet. It happened in the middle of a very sketchy section of downhill over boulders. I was very glad when that was over and we were on a flat gravel road by another river. We met Onesimus in his AT camper. He provided trail magic of ice cream and Coca Cola. He's a retired soldier and does a lot of trail magic. He's done the AT twice. About a mile and a half further on, we reached the shelter. I set up my tent and ate my food with Butterfeet. By that time it was dark. I had a refreshing bathe and shampoo in the river and felt great crawling clean and cool into my tent for a well-deserved sleep. ","Wiley Shelter, NY

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568428,"Today was a good day in so many respects. Technically, it started at midnight last night. I was still awake in my tent. When Butterfeet and I had arrived, I had spoken very briefly to my neighbor, who was 'cowboy camping' (meaning not bothering with any tent or hammock and just sleeping in his sleeping bag on a mattress in the open). I'd asked him how he could cope with all the prodigious swarms of mosquitoes, little black flies, moths, etc. and he said that had sprayed himself with a lot of insect repellent. That didn't sound too attractive to me - I always hate the idea of any ointments or lotions getting on my sleeping stuff. But each to his own. He was a bit gruff with me but I put that down to him wanting to sleep. However a few minutes later he was up and about cooking food. So here he was, at midnight, up and about again, putting up his tent. I felt vindicated. He was just a section hiker - really, what do those amateurs know? Plus, he snored. Loudly. Anyway, I made sure to make a lot of noise when I was getting going in the early morning, but he snored right through it all. Butterfeet and I were away by 7:32. He led the way. He needs a shower and a clothes laundering. He told me he is getting both in a couple of days. High time, emphasis on 'high'. But I digress. He pounded out a great pace, despite the hot weather. I had to make him stop a couple of times for a breather for me. We got to the road crossing I was aiming for by 9:26, which I thought was fantastic in that heat for 4.1 miles. He continued on, while I headed on the road to the little town of Cornwall Bridge, a mile away. Coyote, a Native American hiker with hawk feathers braided into his hair had been waiting for his pre-arranged ride to show up, but decided to go with me when he saw me heading off. We chatted about things Native American for a few minutes, and then his ride showed up and gave me a lift the rest of the way to the local post office. There, I collected my new Salomon boots. They feel so beautiful and clean and sleek on my feet - they are a whole size bigger than the 11s I normally wear. I then proceeded to (a) the hardware store (Gorilla glue); (b) the outfitters (propane gas canister and small compass); (c) the grocery store, Cornwall Country Market (food to eat on their porch and for resupply); and (e) the liquor store (where if you sign their hiker log book, they give you a beer - I asked for a Dr Pepper instead). The glue is to attach some Velcro strips to the back of my new boots that my gaiters can fix onto. At the grocery store, as usual I could only find 56.7% of what I wanted, but Christine came around from behind the counter several times to point me to the items I hadn't found. She's very patient. Hikers are stupid. I bought a giant jar of chocolate milk, a pound of American cheese, wheat thins, and two big bottles of Dr Pepper, all of which I consumed on the porch while my phone charged. Tolmann, another hiker of my age, was playing a hiker's guitar softly. We got talking. He was waiting for his phone to be shuttled to him from where he'd mislaid it further south. He was going to have to take a zero and stay in a motel - expensive mistake, forgetting his phone. Hikers are stupid. I also chatted to Brendan, an elderly first generation Irishman who was there with his wife and two grandchildren. He knows Ireland well and asked if I was from either of the towns of Thurles or Nenagh when I said I was from . Then when I was putting some items in the recycle bin inside, I said to a fit-looking man of around 45 that he looked like a hiker and he said no, he was a cyclist. That set us up for a long chat about road bikes and relaxed geometry frames and other cycling arcana. He also knew Ireland well, especially Bantry, where a seafood company went bankrupt before he could collect through the courts the $1 million they owed him. He knew Eaglebrook and Choate, prep schools my kids went to in Massachusetts and Connecticut, respectively. He used to live on a Swedish island in the Baltic, so I was able to reminisce about swimming there as guests of the Schroders. So it was no wonder I killed a very pleasant three hours in that hamlet. I scored a lift back out to the trail. Then it was just carefully stomping out the miles in my new boots, drinking at virtually every stream I crossed and refilling a bottle to go, and taking occasional breaks to adjust my belt or put on a hat. At a larger brook, there was a bit of depth to the water, and I plunged in in my sweat-soaked sun shirt and shorts and lounged in the current for a few minutes. The water was surprisingly warm. Nobody came by. I enjoyed being cooler as I resumed the hike. I had several opportunities to stop for the day as I reached shelters and campsites, but each time I assessed how I felt and decided to keep going. Despite losing four hours to Cornwall Bridge and the 'swim', I still got 15 miles done when I arrived at a very well-ordered campsite in a fragrant stand of pine trees, with several areas clearly signposted and designated for tents, an open-air privy, a facility for washing dishes, and a spring very close by. I thought I had the whole thing to myself, but Stealth was already in residence higher up the hill. I pitched tent, ate, hung my food bags, and took a shower. The mosquitoes made the eating part quite unpleasant. As I type this out, I can hear them occasionally checking out my tent. They can test my defenses all they want. I'm secure in my castle. Oh and one big change. I decided that eating two Snickers bars last thing every night is unhealthy. So with resignation and no small amount of willpower, I will no longer do so. Instead, I'm substituting two Almond Joy* bars - way healthier, with all that coconut. Ah, yum!
*For the Europeans - think Bounty bars.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568555,"Last night, around about midnight, there was a loud noise, almost like a heavy weapon firing, followed by a big crashing noise. A tree had fallen in the woods. There was no wind. As I was preparing to leave this morning, Stealth came by and we hiked together for the rest of the day. The weather was really warm for most of the morning, and we were careful to stop at every stream for water. Just 2/10ths of a mile from our campsite, we passed the 700 miles to go mark. Not too long after that, we passed the 1500 miles done mark. The trail became quite rocky as the day wore on, and by the time we had scrambled up to the top of Bear Mountain, we were beginning to feel tired. At the summit of the mountain, we were enjoying the view when a thunderstorm started. We headed down the difficult descent from the peak, while being deluged by rain. It was a pity because a river beside us was so pretty and contained a number of pools that we would have been delighted to swim in if the sun has been shining rather than rain pouring down. My new boots were soon squelching with every step. Both Stealth and I had our share of slips, slides, and falls. But no damage was done. So preoccupied were we that we did not realize that we had left Connecticut and were now in Massachusetts. After Bear Mountain we climbed Mt Race, another really tough ascent. We dropped down and climbed up Mount Everett. We were glad to finally be on the descent to two adjacent shelters. Stealth stopped at the first one and I continued on to the second, because it had tenting sites. It was 9:30 before I could set my pack down. Today marks the end of my 12th week on the trail. Recent milestones include: I reached and passed mile 1500; I completed three more states, New York,New Jersey and Massachusetts; I climbed my 11th Everest; I have completed 69 percent of the trail.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568923,"Taking down my tent was a little easier than normal since I was on a wooden platform for the first time and had no stakes to pull up. I still don't know how to tether one's tent to the boards. But last night was not a night to figure it out in the dark and under mosquito attack. I lay in a little longer than usual. Not too long after I'd set out, I was caught by Butterfeet and we hiked together for the rest of the day. Hiking alone is often boring, and I can usually rely on the person I'm with being slightly or a lot faster than me, so l can draft off them. It was another warm day, but with none of the drama of thunderstorms and waterfalls of rain I experienced yesterday. We did a very respectable pace for the first couple of hours. We seemed to cross umpteen roads. We also came upon a remarkable ravine. The photo doesn't do it, or my nervousness as I posed on a rock over the gorge, justice. Around midday we stopped on the bank of a river for lunch, and I heard a voice call my name from the path above us. It was Half-Pint from Boston. We had last met when staying at the Greasy Creek Hostel in North Carolina, on April 6th. She left the trail at Harpers Ferry and is now back on as a SOBO. I promised to look her up when I'm in Boston. Towards the end of the day's hike, I told Butterfeet that he should make his own way to the shelter and not wait for me, as I would just slow him down and there were no signs that the trail would turn treacherous (as it did when I waited for Stealth towards the end of our day yesterday). He duly motored on. About three miles from the finish I met a day hiker who said he had come face to face with a bear on the trail close to the shelter, but I saw nothing. I finished the day feeling fairly strong. The mosquitoes at the shelter were out in force and for the first time I used my headnet, which I have carried from the beginning. It was very effective. I also wore my light rain jacket as they were biting me through my sun shirt. I cooked my food in my tent. I rinsed out my day's hiking clothes and took a shower. My phone was back in non-cooperative mode so I had to abandon attempts to update my journal.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568925,"I got up early and hit the trail by 6:45. I was anxious to ensure that I made it on time to the pickup point I'd arranged with Jim, a teacher from a nearby boarding school, who had been my son's dorm advisor there six or seven years ago. I made really good time, getting up to 2.5 mph for the first couple of hours, which is Formula 1 level for me. Near the end of the day's hike, the trail skirted Upper Goose Pond. The shelter there is famous for its amenities, such as real beds. It even has a caretaker who cooks pancakes for the hikers. I began to get signals from my Ferrari's shock absorbers (Achilles tendons) that the day had taken a toll, and about two miles from the end, in a scenic conifer glade beside the lake that came equipped with chair-height rocks, I stopped to give myself a rest and have some trail mix. Butterfeet came by and joined me. Then came a familiar face atop a long, lean body, and a startled ""?!"". It was Scooby. I don't know when we last saw each other, but it was probably back in North Carolina. He told me that many of our group back then are in the area. He thinks that Sweet Spot, Lucky Cub, Lioness and others have passed me. I went with him the half mile or so to the turn off for the Upper Goose Pond shelter. I asked him if next year he would be back to do the AT again as a SOBO. His response - ""Whaaat? Do you think I'm nuts? No way! This is it!"" - so exactly matched my own when somebody posed that question to me a while back that I burst out laughing and said that I needed his photograph so that I can say ""Here standeth an honest man"". Like me he has simmering foot and leg issues that he hopes will stay low-level so that he can complete the trail. A short distance after we parted, I stepped aside to allow a young man and his daughter to pass me, and didn't realize it was Jim and his 5-year-old daughter, Maddy, who were hiking south to intercept me. We turned around and headed back to their car, crossing the Mass Turnpike on the way. (I have driven that highway so many times that it feels like home.) On my advice, Jim had brought a big black garbage bag to put my backpack in for odor management. We drove the 5 miles into the town of Lee, where I secured a room in the first motel we came to, a Super 8. I had a quick shower and change of clothes, and we headed out for resupply, lunch, and ice cream. Jim paid for lunch, which was generous and a bit naughty of him considering how much of the food consumed was mine. I got to bed early since I had no working phone for journal purposes. It's quite interesting how lonely  and disconnected that makes me feel. Writing the journal always gives me a boost. I try to be upbeat and good-humored in my writing, and undoubtedly that helps my psyche, as does the feeling that I'm in contact with others.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568933,"A significant drawback to the motel I was staying in was that it had no guest laundry facility, which is quite unusual. I had handwashed virtually all my clothes, but they were still damp when I put them on for my hike. That in itself is no big deal, as I've done the same dozens of times out on the trail. But it did set the stage.It was overcast when I walked out. Before I could even extend a thumb, a car pulled off the road and stopped beside me. A grinning Coyote (looking much cleaner than when we met near Cornwall Bridge a few days ago, and featherless) was in the passenger seat, being given a lift to the bus stop by Nancy, the caretaker at Upper Goose Pond Shelter. She had three big propane gas tanks in the trunk - think of all those pancakes she cooks. It took us a while to locate the bus stop. Coyote is heading off trail for a while to see his girlfriend. Nancy and I chatted about grammar as she drove me back to the AT. She's a teacher. I told her about the two Game of Thrones episodes that have featured Stanis being the Grammar Nazi (look them up on YouTube) and she anticipated the punch line. Smart lady.It was 10:14 before I got on the trail. I had an hour or so of dry weather, and then the anticipated rain began. Around lunch-time I stopped at October Mountain Shelter. I had followed directions from Jim Murray that morning in pouring a big heap of bow tie pasta into a Ziploc bag, emptying a bottle of Paul Newman's dressing on it and sealing it. Sure enough, just like Jim said, the pasta was 'cooked' al dente and I left the shelter quite full. Another thru-hiker, Forest, had arrived just as I was leaving. He was wearing very short running shorts and his legs are covered in tattoos. He started in Georgia in April and has been doing 30-40 miles each day. He stormed past me about two hours after I left the shelter.The rain was making me miserable. When I reached the turn-off for the Kay Wood Shelter where I had planned to stop, the thought of putting my tent up in the rain was depressing. Then I saw, right under the sign saying ""Shelter ---> 0.17 miles"", ""Dalton - 2.5 miles"", and my weak self said ""You can go 2.5 miles more"", and I swerved around and headed back on the trail. The AT goes through the historic town of Dalton (lots of houses with dates on them, like ""1803""). But the motel was on the far side of the town, and it was full. I called the EconoLodge a couple of miles away and secured a room. I tried to get a taxi but no luck. So I started hitchhiking and got lucky within five minutes. The room was standard motel, but had a communicating door to the next room, and I could hear every word the couple in there were (loudly) saying. I got my room changed to further down the block. My phone, oddly enough considering the rain today, was working much better but I was too tired to do much more than shower and crawl into bed. At 1am I was woken by the couple, who had moved their loud conversation outside onto the walkway while they smoked. I got up, went outside, and asked them to quieter down. They complied.

I went out to a nearby diner where I had my usual double breakfast. Back in my motel room, I concentrated on catching up on the three days of trail journals that were outstanding, on repairing tears in my backpack cover (Mark's duct tape), sewing up a ripped seam in my shorts, doing laundry, glueing Velcro strips to the backs of my new boots for attaching my Dirty Girl gaiters to, shortening my belt length (no, I don't think I've lost any more weight, but my belt has been very slightly too long for weeks and I hate when it slips down and gets caught between my pack belt and my hips. I'm trying to avoid the 'pack burn' which afflicted me in the first half of my hike and which has mercifully disappeared thanks to the Osprey Atmos pack that I started using May 8th), and reading up about the White Mountains and other beasts that lie ahead. Fin, one of my readers and an avid hiker and Irishman, called me, concerned at my apparent emotional trough. We talked for a long time. I also had a call from Rooster, who is going to be off trail and so expects that I will catch up to him; he too was concerned. Their support is important and buoys me up. I also exchanged emails with my friend Tom, who has offered to take me to his house in New Hampshire for a break when I am in his neighborhood. After a double dinner at a Friendly's across the street, I FaceTimed my wife Gayle. She is enjoying a girls' weekend at home with two good friends, Katie and Janice, who flew in on Friday.

It may have been the fact that I was going uphill immediately, but I felt tired. My backpack weighed heavily on me. This always seems to happen after a zero or a break, and I've heard others say the same - that you are dying for a zero, but after it, you're dying. After a 900-foot climb, there was the scenic though badly-named Gore Pond. Frogs croaked all over it. Then there was a descent into the town of Cheshire. I stopped at Diane's Twist, a little store by the side of the road, and had an ice cream cone and a tuna sandwich, in that order. I chatted with Ray and Jackie, two cyclists. Jackie is keen to go hiking, and gave my pack and poles a thorough examination. She had many practical questions. I had to get moving as time was going by. The climb out of Cheshire to the top of Mt Greylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts at 3,491 feet, was about 2,500 net, but of course was more than that as the trail as always occasionally dropped downhill. I hate that. It's those ATC sadists, of course. David ""AWOL"" Miller, in his book about his 2002 thru-hike, invented the term 'PUDS' as a way of expressing his frustration at the 'pointless ups and downs' that are sometimes built into the route. (By the way, in his book, he refers several times to another  who hiked that year. It turns out that my brother John knew the man, Paudie Moloughmey, and had even played golf with him. Like me, Paudie came from .) The first mile of the climb was the worst, going up steeply through meadows in the blazing sun. Once back in the woods, the heat was less and the climb was moderate but long. The distance from Cheshire to Greylock's summit is almost 8 miles. I met no NOBO thru-hikers. At the summit, there is the very striking Veterans War Memorial Tower, and views that on a less hazy day would have been even more impressive than they were. I didn't linger long there as I wanted to reach Wilbur Clearing Shelter in daylight. When I got there, I met Scooby again, and tented beside Freebird, a young recently-graduated native of Front Royal, VA. She is a William & Mary alum, like my wife. At the shelter were three more young folk - Joe, Hot Mess and Wiki (who shared some of her cookie dough biscuits with me). We talked for a while before I headed off for water. I took a shower and cooked my meal. As an experiment, I used the broth from my stroganoff to try to rehydrate some pasta overnight.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569321,"It had rained a little overnight, a precursor of things to come. My shirt and shorts as usual were as wet as I left them. I ate the rehydrated pasta from last night - it worked well. I was on the trail by 7:13. Today was a day of milestones. Almost immediately there was a punishing 2,000-foot descent into the town of Williamstown, but just as I started it, I broke through the 600 miles to go mark. Yaay! I stopped on the far outskirts of town to enjoy a Pop-Tart before re-entering the woods to begin a 2,200-foot ascent. A resident had placed benches and chairs for hikers to use. Freebird caught up with me and I let her go ahead. No sense trying to stay ahead of a 23-year-old. But at 9:37 the first drops of rain began to fall, and I overtook her as she donned rain gear - jacket, pants and gaiters. I of course just soldiered on, as wearing rain gear just gets me as wet as the rain does, but smellier.Soon, there was a thunderstorm going on. It was to continue until close to 5pm with a couple of breaks. I soon came upon a very rocky uphill section, highly reminiscent of Pissha (regular readers know what that means). So treacherous was it, that the ATC had blue-blazed a trail to the west as a bad weather bypass trail. Naturally, given that there was heavy rain and lightning, I opted to...stay on the white-blazed trail. I was expecting Freebird to show up but when she didn't I assumed she'd gone around me via the bypass trail. The storm was at its fiercest as I crested an intermediate peak before the summit. I hurried down the other side to get off the exposed ridge. The storm abated and the sun even showed its face for a while. I went into the Seth Warner Shelter for a seat while having lunch, and Freebird soon showed up. Turns out that she did not take the weakling bypass trail, but just delayed going up on the ridge while the storm raged. She said she was thinking of staying put for the day. I kept going.There was the peak to scale and the storm came back, right over me, lightning crashing within a mile of me on two occasions. The rain was heavy. I was placing a lot of faith on statistics, specifically on those that say one is far more at risk driving to the grocery store that being out in a lightning storm. I barely paused at the second milestone, the crossing of the Massachusetts-Vermont border. Yaay 2! I certainly wasn't stopping to take out my already misbehaving phone for a photograph. I dashed across an exposed stretch of slope where a powerline was strung. On the summit there was no marker, view or any lingering by me for sentimental considerations. Thor was busy banging his hammer and sending the sparks flying from Valhalla. I passed another pond with those croaking frogs. By now the rain had turned every path into a stream and every depression into a pool. Mud was everywhere. But at least it seemed to keep the mosquitoes away. I decided that, based on first impressions, Vermont is a swamp masquerading as a state. It was truly liberating to be released from the need to pick my way carefully, hopping from rock to rock or slithering along downed tree-trunks in an effort to stay out of the wet and keep my boots dry. There was no point. I just sloshed through water, squelched through mud, happy as a clam. There were oodles of my friends out cheering me on - the little Eastern red-spotted newts. At one stage I sank in mud that came above the top of my left boot. Shrug. Immerse boots in next river to be crossed. Nice clean boots. Socks likely very clean too, at least until next mudfest. Came the third milestone, as I blew past the 1,600 miles traveled point. Yaay 3! The third high point, Consultation Peak, again featured a resurgence of the storm but after that, as I descended towards the destination shelter, it got eerily quiet. I was a bit concerned when the trail headed to a river that was heavily swollen by the rain, but it veered away.The shelter popped up well before I was expecting it (very unusual, that) and there were four hikers in the shelter. Splash and Superman were a couple just one day into a hike when she hurt her knee, so they had spent the day at the shelter recuperating. Intrepid and Ref were the other two. All were non-teenagers and delightful conversationalists. I realized that trying to find a dry spot to pitch my tent on was going to be tough, so I...stayed in the shelter. I had an upper bunk, and was quite comfy there. There was one light snorer, but two Ibuprofen PMs helped me pass out.

It was warm and sunny. My plan was to hike the 18.7 miles to Kid Gore Shelter. But when I stopped for a snack and to enjoy the sunshine at a parking area where the AT crosses VT 9, I got talking to a couple visiting from Ohio, and they asked if I wanted a ride into the town of Bennington, 5 miles away. On the spur of the moment, I accepted.Peña and Brian are professors at a special needs college. He enjoys hiking. They dropped me off on Main Street. I bought supplies, and went to a diner for a late breakfast. I spent some time there catching up on two days of journals as my phone was cooperating after being dried out in the sunshine. It was well into afternoon by the time I left.I hitched a lift with Ashley, who delivers blood and medical supplies in the area. By the time I got back hiking, I decided that Kid Gore was not a viable option and aimed for Goddard Shelter instead, four miles closer. When I arrived, there were quite a few tents already up in an area where AWOL's guide says there is ""limited tenting"". My site was narrow (constricted by trees) and a bit sloping, but acceptable. I dived into my tent as soon as I had it up and zippered it tight, as the black flies were feasting on me in droves. I swatted six of them in one slap on my leg. But here I am, safe. A man's tent is his castle. See, this is me, waving from the ramparts.Milestones: today saw me completing 13 weeks  on the AT. That's a quarter of a year. In the last week or so, I have gone through two more states - Connecticut and Massachusetts - leaving three to do; I've completed 74% of the distance; I hiked through an all-day thunderstorm; and I've started in on my third pair of boots and hope they will take me the rest of the way to Katahdin.

By the time I got on trail, it was 8:15 - I'm getting more easygoing as I get closer to finishing. There was a long, gradual descent of 1,500 feet spread over 12 miles, then a 1,700-foot climb up Mt Stratton in just under four miles. The common denominator was mud - that black, squelchy mud formed by rotting leaves. It has begun to dry out after recent rains, but even so some of the stretches of mud were long and testing. Successive waves of hikers have gradually broadened the paths in such places to get around those mud holes, and in doing so have simply made the mud holes wider. The ATC begs hikers not to do so. I tried to be good, and to hop from rock to rock or log to log, but sometimes it was a choice between having dry boots by skirting guiltily around the edge, or wet boots as you obeyed the ATC. Dry boots usually won.At a shelter where I stopped for lunch, a young man called my name. It was Leaf, whom I recalled last seeing in North Carolina. Funny how so many of us who started together are now only a few days apart. I also later met a young male hiker, who, when I asked him what kind of hiker he was, responded ""I'm thru-hiking - on the Long Trail"". I felt a bit miffed at this use of the 'thru-hiking' accolade, which until now I'd never heard applied to anything but the AT. But the AT and the Vermont Long Trail run together for 105.2 miles from when we crossed into Vermont. The LT continues on for nearly 150 miles more after the trails diverge. So I suppose it's fair to say you are 'thru-hiking' the LT. Sniff.The views from the fire tower on top of Stratton were gorgeous (I could see at least four ski resorts), but there were strong and cold winds that helped me keep my stay up there very short. I had been aiming for a campsite on a lake, but when I got to the fork in the trail for the campsite, I opted to avoid the 0.5-mile hike to the site and just keep going. I found a very marginal and rather damp spot about 0.6 miles further on. Given the recent bear activity at some shelters, I was annoyed at the usual problem - one is surrounded by trees, but not one of them has a branch protruding low enough to use for hanging a bear bag. I used a less than perfect small tree that a big bear might be able to bend down close to the ground to get at the bag.*Rich, I included the photo of the plaque at the fire tower as I know you will enjoy identifying the apostrophic typos.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569749,"As if to emphasize just how damp my tentsite was, when I was breaking camp I found about ten slugs clinging to my tent and groundsheet. Dipped in an egg yolk batter and fried, they tasted really good and as everyone knows, they're full of protein.
I had a very good day. Firstly, the weather was lovely. It was warm, often sunny (although from inside the green tunnel, that is a bit irrelevant), and there was a bit of a breeze. I got away at 8:36. And since the first few miles were flat, I made excellent time. I stopped a couple of times to try to contact Rich, my friend whom I stayed with in NJ, and who was thinking of picking me up tomorrow, and Tom, who is planning a pickup in a week's time, but my phone was still a mess. Finally in desperation I tore open a Knorr Spanish Rice packet, put it in a Ziploc bag and put the phone in there too, in an effort to dry the wretched device out.Somewhere in the first hour, I passed the unmarked point where mile 1642.0 occurred - 75% of the AT done!
I enjoyed being on a gravel logging road that was flat, open (so I had some sunshine) and a mile long. It was so relaxing not having to watch for rocks and tree roots and mud. After ten miles I reached a crossing. I hadn't planned on a side trip into the town of Manchester Center, 5.4 miles away, but I said I'd try hitching a ride for five minutes and if nothing happened, I'd keep hiking. Lo and behold, a car pulled off the busy road. It was driven by Spice, a self-described 'lezzie' and musician returning from a camping event out in the woods. Her car was a total shambles, with gear, guitars, a plastic bucket full of woodland plants she was bringing home, food and other stuff piled haphazardly. She moved the bucket from the passenger seat and told me to dump my pack on top of the guitars. We became best friends instantly. She spotted a produce store by the roadside and we went in. I bought raspberries, strawberries, a smoked chili cheese, and fudge for us both. She invested in Vermont syrup. In the car park of Zoey's Deli in town, we took photos of each other and said our goodbyes.
In the deli I ordered a sub to eat there and one to go. I paid for a large Dr Pepper and three refills, two of which went into my Hydrapak. I managed to read an email from Rich in which he said that regrettably he wouldn't be coming to Vermont tomorrow. I managed to send an email to him, and he immediately called. I had a great chat with him. He knows Zoey's well; it is just 30 minutes from his Vermont house. As my phone had robo-dialed my wife, she called me in some concern that I was in trouble, and we had a very short chat before she dashed back into a meeting at work.
I threw my phone back into its bed of Spanish rice and went across the street to a shop for a few supplies. I hitched a lift with a golf pro, Peter Wetherby, returning home from the Vermont Open. I asked him if he was famous, and he said ""Not based on the Vermont Open"". He's a hiker in his spare time, and is planning a hike in Iceland. He dropped me off at the point where his road veered south. I realized that I'd been having such fun chatting with him that we'd driven nearly a mile past the AT. So I had to hike back.
Antman was there, enjoying food supplied by a family for their hiking dad, who was also there. The matriarch of the family, whom I am not to refer to as Grandma, plied me with fruit, which I was happy to accept. I headed off up Bromley Mountain, a ski resort. It's just over a three-mile climb and was easy, despite a full backpack. I sat in the chairlift at the top and admired the view. I could have sat there for hours - nice padded seat, like a recliner - but I had to push on. I met Mulga and Jane, hikers from Melbourne, Australia. They are flip-flopping, but doing the whole trail and planning on taking six months or more. Later on, at a gap, two older male hikers told me I was going south, as they were NOBOs. I panicked. Not again! But this time it was they who had climbed up to Styles Peak, enjoyed the view, then by accident gone back down the way they'd come. They guessed they'd lost at least two hours, as they turned around to re-climb the mountain. I really enjoyed the climb up, sipping Dr Pepper occasionally.
I made it to the tenting site by a lake slightly ahead of schedule, at 8pm. A couple, Joanna and Chet, were 'glamping' at one of the tent platforms near me. (It means 'glamour camping'). They had only hiked in three miles, and had all kinds of gear, including a large frying pan, in which they were cooking a mound of food. They invited me to join them, and I brought along my Zoey's sub, but then they offered me dinner, and I accepted. (Rooster's yogi training is paying off.) They are well-traveled, and talked about their trips to Kilimanjaro, Nepal and India. We could have chatted hours longer, but by 11 I needed to get to my tent. Wow! My phone was working again, despite the humidity. I typed up yesterday's journal, although I was unable to post it as I had no signal. I was too tired to do more, and was asleep as soon as my head hit my pillow, at 12:30. I love Spanish rice. ","Stealth camping after Stratton Pond Shelter, VT

I was back in my tent when a few spatters of rain hit. I decided that a speedy breaking of camp was in order. I was still dead late leaving - 8:36.I was pleased that the trail was easy and undulating and mud was minimal compared to previous days. After 2 solid hours' hiking, I stopped in at Lost Pond Shelter to enjoy my Zoey's ham sub, finally. A hiking couple joined me and we chatted a while. I quietly pushed on when she rather gratuitously and dismissively questioned the value of raising money for cancer research. As many of you know, I participate in the Pan-Mass Challenge annually, and this year the event is targeting $48 million. A couple of miles later, the sun was baking down on a tumbling river that was so inviting that I shed my boots and shirt and bathed in a rock pool. Antman came by and rinsed off his shirt. He is an aircraft maintenance technician who previously worked for the military on cargo planes and then crossed over into the civilian world. We hiked together for five more miles and reached Little Rock Pond. Across the lake were rocks and what looked like a cliff that would be great for jumping from. We looked at each other and I said ""Let's swim over"". He said ""You're crazy!"" but soon was in the water with me. I struck out for the far shore. The water was pleasant but not warm. Upon reaching the rocks, about 300 yards away, some bathers there said that my buddy had gotten into trouble but that somebody had rescued him. I went back. Antman was sitting on a rock by the shore. We went up to the nearby shelter with his rescuer, Chris, and Chris' two young sons. Antman said he'd misjudged his ability to reach the far side, and panicked. His pulse was still racing and he lay down to recover. After about ten minutes he was looking better. He embraced Chris, who left. We chatted about staying put. Getting the ten miles to the Minerva Hinchey Shelter was no longer the smart thing to do. We agreed we could go five more miles to an intermediate shelter, Greenwall. But first we went to look for Antman's sandals, which he'd been wearing when he started swimming but had kicked off as he got into difficulties. They were now floating off across the lake. I swam out and retrieved them. The water felt much colder on my third time in. We continued to the shelter without incident. Two hikers I'd not met before, Woods Strider and Dana, were already there. It had started to rain about ten minutes before we arrived and soon was a downpour, which was depressing to me. My back was hurting me and I'd been looking forward to a peaceful dry night in the privacy of my tent. In a break in the rain, I rushed out and set up my tent down the hill and was pleased at how dry it stayed. Antman also set up. Other hikers arrived to stay at the shelter. I cooked up ramen and did some stretches for my back, which seemed to help.

I got on the trail by 8:32. Just as I was leaving, Antman emerged from his tent. He was still feeling the effects of his swimming incident and talking about doing a 10-mile day. I wished him all the best and headed out.There was an immediate descent of 1,000 feet, followed by a 1,000-foot climb. The trail was nice - a lot of it flat and covered in dry leaves as if all the recent rain had missed it. I was annoyed that the trail gods had not allowed for even one vista point on this section of the AT, as it gets boring being stuck in the green tunnel all day. I stopped at Minerva Hinchey Shelter to lie down for back relief. There I met Downward Cow, a young man missing his fiancée, who had written in the shelter register about not getting up until noon.Right after the shelter, there was a view out over Rutland Airport. The trail then drops almost to sea level at 820 feet, at a point where it crosses a gorge via a suspension bridge. I saw a family swimming in a pool below and went down to join them. I was able to swim against the current as if I was in a finger pool. Shortly after getting out, Antman showed up, and opted to just cool off his legs in the water. He was followed by Downward Cow, who really seemed to relish the swimming. I went off on my own to tackle the long 3,100-foot haul up to Cooper Lodge Shelter, near the top of yet another ski mountain. Antman passed me, then I passed him when he paused at another shelter, and then he roared past me again. I eventually reached the shelter at 7:12. It was cold. I climbed the 0.2 to the summit to check out the views but came straight back down from the winds at the top. Antman and Downward Cow opted to stay in the shelter (which had a door because of the aggressive porcupines) while I set up on a tenting platform. I ate my food in the shelter and then went to bed. I was too exhausted to even get my phone out of its rice-bag, let alone type up this journal. During the night it was cold, and I put on my puffy jacket.

Shortly after that, the AT and the Long Trail parted company. And not long after that, I hit a blue-blazed side trail. My offsite trail coach and Leukotape provider, Lumberjack, had highly recommended that I invest the 0.5 miles to reach the Inn at Long Trail, or more specifically McGrath's Irish Pub inside the Inn, where Bob the bartender confirmed that the Guinness Stew was definitely available. I had a great meal and a chat with Bob, who has visited Ireland (including ) and who challenged me to translate an Irish phrase, which I got 50% right - something about shaving a sleeping mouse's whiskers. I gave my devices a little extra charge which will help me until I get to Tom's on Thursday. Bob told me that Lucky Cub, my Northern Irish fellow-hiker, was in the pub yesterday. Maybe I will catch up to him after 1,500 miles! I also saw Geezer had signed the Inn's hiker register. Okie, the genial manager, showed me a box of Irish and Scottish LPs he had saved from being thrown away. Most were compilations with titles to make you wince, like ""Folk Music of Ireland"", but he had one or two gems, like a very early Boys of the Lough recording that I don't think I have in my collection. Okie lives in a part of Vermont's forest that has no mains electricity - everything is run off propane. So now he has bought a turntable to play these LPs.I called my wife and my mother and updated them on my progress. They both seemed glad I'm still alive. I got back on the trail and felt really strong. The trail was lovely too, and lent itself to longer strides and more speed. Along the way I met Grateful and Stove Top, whom I've run into twice before. They were key-swapping, which means they had each driven to opposite ends of a section of trail. Then they would each hike along the trail to the other's car. When they would meet up roughly halfway along the section, they would swop keys so that each of them could drive to wherever they had planned to go. I also met Charlie Holland, a colorfully dressed trail maintainer, aged 71. And to cap it all, as I was crossing a deserted gravel forest road, along came a battered old Jeep, driven by...Okie, who was heading home. He stopped for a further brief chat. Really, it's amazing I ever get anywhere on this AT, with all the distractions. I reached Stony Brook Shelter just before 8pm. There were only three people there.

In fact, today's hike included over 5,800 feet of climbing. But at least the trails were nice - leaf-covered, or even better, pine needle carpet, with low levels of rock or root to bother with. That said, in the first half-mile, an ordinary aluminum extendable ladder had been tied to one rock face as without it getting down would have been very difficult. About an hour into the hike I met eight members of the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps out maintaining the trail. Their truck plus trailer was parked at a trailhead a couple of miles further on. Around midday I took a side trail to reach The Lookout - a privately-owned cabin with a widow's walk on the roof. The owners encourage hikers to use it. It has fabulous views. I joined day-hikers Geoff and Lisa, recruitment consultants for Vermont businesses, on the roof where the sun made it quite comfortable. I retired to the cabin to upload yesterday's journal and to have lunch (a big block of chili cheese I've been lugging around for days). This all set me back quite a bit. Not too long after I resumed hiking, the threatened rain began. There was a little thunder but not for very long. My main disgruntlement was not with the weather but with the poor quality of the trail maintenance when I came to the first of many unmowed fields. In dry conditions it's less of an issue (although ticks remain a threat). But in the rain, the grass very quickly utterly soaks your legs and boots. It wouldn't take a lot to run a mower over the trail to clear a few feet of ground on either side. But that aside, all went well.I got in to Thistle Hill Shelter around 8:30, and the rain had stopped an hour or so before. Camber, my neighbor from last night's shelter, was already there and set up. In the shelter were Piñata and Rash, whom I'd last seen at The Captain's Place, and Snap, whom I'd also met there, but I'd subsequently run into her at the ATC in Harpers Ferry. There was also Doc Bowman camping beside me. From Waynesboro in Virginia, he played on the same volleyball team as my brother-in-law Mark at Virginia Tech. Small world. As I lie here in my tent, my hips are sore and my legs also - the 'growing pains' discomfort I remember from when I was a small boy. I can find no way to sit or lie to get some ease.

The day was pretty much ideal for hiking. The weather was a tad warm, but there was no rain. The trails were leaf-covered, pine-needle-covered, etc. - yes, I know I said this yesterday, but it's still such a treat! I was anxious to get to the town of Hanover before the post office closed, so I was pushing myself to cruise through the miles. As I was crossing a bridge in, or in the vicinity of, West Hartford, I was waved over to a house across the bridge where I found several of my hiking buddies ensconced, having breakfast (Rash/Piñata/Snap, a chap called Chef Boyardee, and a woman called Trinket). Randy and Linda provide coffee, muffins, fruit, and a heaping plate of scrambled eggs and sausage with toast. He hiked once and hated it. She's more the hiker than he is. They knock a kick out of having hikers sprawled on their front porch. Bless them. I ate all that was put before me, and went on my way.
Rash and Piñata caught me going up the hill out of town, but Rash has almost no speed going downhill due to knee problems, so I caught them back. The trail drops down to the beautiful little town of Norwich. Several houses leave coolers of trail magic for thru-hikers. I got talking to Betsy, one such trail angel, who was working in her garden, and she invited me to stay for the night. Since it was early, she said that she or her husband Bill would pick me up wherever I finished hiking for the day. I took her number, as I wasn't sure how my time would work out, and pushed on.
I dropped into Don & Whit's store for a few supplies. I had an ice cream cone also. It was a fairly short walk alongside a busy road to reach the bridge out of Vermont and into New Hampshire. Another state done! I reached the post office in the busy town of Hanover with an hour to spare and picked up a package sent by my wife, containing more ointment for my feet. I grabbed a strawberry milkshake at a nearby store, and called Betsy to tell her that I would keep hiking another four miles, but that I would love to take her up on her offer if it still stood. I gave her the details of the road crossing I was aiming for, and she said that would work. So off I went. 
The four miles went by speedily. There's one point in there where it's steep enough that the Dartmouth hiking club has installed a long rope with knots on it for pulling oneself up the rock face. I just used my poles. At the pickup point, Betsy's husband Bill showed up at 7 as planned, as storm clouds with some minor rain were dissipating. When I reached their house, I left my backpack and food in their garage, the food hung to avoid small visitors. I took my clothes in for laundering. I showered and joined my hosts at dinner. Also at the table was Powerhouse, a German hiker. We had a great meal, full of lively chat. There was dessert of bread pudding with rhubarb. I had about three helpings of that. Betsy explained that she and Bill take in hikers because of the care a family in Virginia took when Bill and Betsy's thru-hiker son was recuperating with that family for over a week. This is their way of paying back and 'paying forward'. They asked Powerhouse and me to do a similar act of kindness for other people. After dinner Powerhouse and I were installed in the basement on air mattresses. I was very happy with my day.
Milestones: it's the end of week 14. In the last week, I've done my 12th of 14 states, passed the 1,700-miles-done mark, passed the 500-miles-to-go mark, and climbed my 12th Everest.

The blazing of the trail has been a bit less frequent from time to time, as people had warned me about. However usually you can be fairly confident that you're on the AT. But it's nice to get that confirmatory white stripe after a spell without. The climb up Cube featured some very rocky stretches, a small foretaste of the Whites. But mostly it was friendly terrain, and included a fair amount of careful traipsing across continuous bald rock near the top. Then came the descent off Cube. It started to rain, which complicated matters. I had several slips on slick tree roots, and a scary moment when I stepped on a tree trunk boardwalk only to find out that it was not level but sloped downhill slightly, and was slick. I slid right off it but managed to control things so that I didn't end up falling. Perhaps because of these incidents, my back started to send me messages. At a brook near the bottom I stopped and shampooed my hair and had a bath in a pool. I changed into a clean tshirt. I was a bit later than planned so I ran the last 1.6 miles on easy trails to reach NH25A and Tom's car. He drove me to Walmart for supplies and then off to where he and Liz live on Squam Lake. I am being treated like royalty and may take two zeros here. Or I may move in here permanently.

I lay on the floor and sat in a chair in efforts to find some position that would ease the pain enough for me to sleep. In the morning Tom drove me to ""the kids' house"", which his children get to use, and picked up Bill, Bill's younger daughter, and their Labradoodle dog, and drove us to the 'boat livery' so that Bill could get his boat and bring it to his (Bill's) dock. I rode in the boat. It started to rain as we were docking. Tom came back for me and insisted that I go to a walk-in clinic in nearby Laconia. There I was prescribed steroids for muscle inflammation and something else as a muscle relaxant to help me sleep. We stopped in at a hardware store on the way home where I bought 12' of light rope for use in hauling my backpack after me on some of the technical sections of the Whites - if that works better than pushing it up ahead of me. I can also use it as a washing line. Back at the house, I took a steroid and went for a short nap. In the evening, Bill and his family, and his sister Suzanne and her family, came over for dinner. Lee had prepared all the fixings for shrimp tacos which were exquisite. I had several. It poured rain while we were eating but the forecast for the next week is looking the best since I've been on the AT.","

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570769,"While we were having dinner last night, I was aware of a certain amount of rain going on. Indeed, I received a couple of flood alerts for the area on my phone. But I didn't really think much about it, as I was very firmly in the dry. But around midday today, Tom was dropping me back to the trail. He had cooked eggs and ham for me for a late breakfast. I'd also had cereal and a chicken and cheese sandwich. The sun was shining. When we got to the junction for NH25A, the road was closed. Tom steered between the cones anyway and moved on cautiously. There was road damage. In places, flood waters had undercut the shoulder of the road, and small sections of the roadside had caved in. Where I was to be dropped off, water was streaming across the road, and traffic was taking turns going on the shallower side. Tom looked at me and suggested I cut in on the AT further north. This, of course, was anathema to me. I said I'd be all right. We both looked at the water level where the AT left the road and cut into the woods. I said ""Look, there's a boardwalk. I'll be fine."" I got out, geared up, and gave Tom a big hug. He told me to call him if I got into difficulties, but said that he couldn't bear to watch me go up to my neck in water after all the drying-out I'd done in the last few days, and he drove off. I walked towards the 'boardwalk', which was the usual affair of a log split in two, laid side by side and nailed on top of two square baulks of timber at each end. There were several of them leading across the water into the woods. As I stepped on the first one, it suddenly became clear that it was simply floating on the water, as it pitched down into the water and I fell forwards. I grabbed at the boardwalk and wondered if I could lie down on it on my stomach and paddle it towards the 'shore' like a surfer paddles a surfboard. I tried it, but it sank under me, and my arms and chest got wet. So I sez ""Right, nothing for it but to get walking."" I marched through the water past all the useless boardwalks towards the next white blaze. The water came up close to my waist. Even in the woods, the flooding persisted and detecting where the path was under the water was guesswork at times. But soon enough there was a slight incline and the path emerged above water level. Then it was back to that walk out of Daleville in Virginia, with the trail being more of a stream, and no worries about keeping boots dry. There was a lot of Vermont in the trail, too, with lots and lots of mud. There was even a sign some wag had written and put in a Ziploc bag beside one knife-edged rock sticking up in the middle of the trail, which said ""Special sharp rock imported from Pennsylvania"". [Yes, I know, I broke my own rule. Whaddya want me to do, sue myself?] It was annoying to have a sunny day, but be suffering from the effects of the previous night's extreme weather. I called Tom's number from the top of Mt. Mist, just to let him and Liz know that I'd survived. Liz picked up the phone. She was skeptical about me summiting Moosilauke today as I'd likely be in the dark for some of it. I said I'd be fine. However as I progressed further I decided she was right, and that I should call it quits for the day at the Jeffers shelter at the foot of the Moosilauke climb. When I had to ford a river with water again over my boots, I felt confident that I was being wise to be satisfied with a smaller mileage than I'd planned. During that mileage, I passed the 400-miles-to-go mark. At the shelter there were two hikers, a SOBO called Sam who works for the Democratic Party in Arizona, and Two Decades, a regular section hiker on the AT. Malink, Chef Boyardee, Crazy Horse and a couple of others rolled in later. I got one of the nicest tent spots I've had on the trail - level, on a bed of dry leaves and pine needles, and in the background the sound of the brook thundering over some rapids. I was happy that my back had not caused me issues during the hike, although as soon as I took off my pack at the shelter, I had to sit down to manage the pain that started up right on cue. It subsided quickly though. I ate a meal of Back Country Pantry Pad Thai - my old favorite - and some tortillas with Spam laced with Tabasco. I devoured the two oranges Liz had handed me as I went out the door, and had my usual two Snickers bars to round off the meal and the day. Yawn. Time for bed.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570792,"By 7:06 I was on the way up the 3,500 feet to the top of the first of the infamous and dreaded White Mountains, Mt Moosilauke, whose summit is at 4,802 feet. The climb was simply tough. There was of course water still coursing down and lots of mud. But the sun was shining above the trees. Initially the main obstacle was tree roots. While I was dealing with them, I met Medicine Man, whom I'd last seen back in the rocky state when I was with Rooster and Co. A lady called Birk came up while I was snacking and recognized me from when somebody pointed me out to her in the Irish pub in the Inn at Long Trail in Vermont.  There were SOBOs and day hikers coming down the trail too; it being the day before the July 4th holiday means there are lots of day-hikers out.After a while the roots gave way to rocks as the main obstacle. But it was all good, just requiring one foot going in front of another. At the summit, which was above the treeline, I caught up with Crazy Horse and Two Decades. It was windy and cold so I rushed off as soon as a photo of me was in the bag. The descent from the summit, especially after the Beaver Brook shelter, was very hard. There were boulders rather than rocks, some steep stretches down bare rock that the ATC had equipped with wooden steps, rebar to hang onto, or had drilled steps out of the bare rock. In one short stretch after the shelter, I slipped and fell three times. The second fall happened when my right-hand pole went down into a hole I hadn't seen between two rocks and I pitched forward, snapping the pole into three pieces. I was able to find a branch to use as a substitute and made my way gingerly down the rest of the descent. I stopped by some waterfalls for lunch and was passed by all the gang I'd seen on the trail all day. I found most of them again at some trail magic by the Lost River Road, hosted by Jon, husband to X-ray who is hiking the trail. They live in Boston not too far from our apartment there. Jon gave Malink, Chef Boyardee and me a lift into the town of Lincoln, where I bought a cheap replacement pole. I went to a McDonalds for a burger and to charge my phone. While I was there I called my wife and updated my trail journal for yesterday. At about 6pm I headed out to hitch the 6 miles back to the trail. I thought it best to hike until I was past the turnoff onto the interstate and soon after that got a lift with Jeff, a survival instructor with the Navy at the Maine Maritime Institute. He does a lot of hiking and his poles were in the trunk from a hike he'd done over the weekend. Even though he was only going a mile up the road, he was kind enough to take me the almost six miles back to the AT. I was between two minds whether to camp out near the Lost River Road parking lot, or take a chance on hiking further on the trail and finding a stealth campsite. I opted to hike. I was soon caught by two fast-moving young men, Caveman and Bumblebee. I noticed as Caveman was hurtling by that he had a prosthetic leg. He told me he'd lost the leg due to a medical condition when he was a child. I went about three miles before I watered up and found a little dell off-trail through some large rocks. There was just enough space to put my tent down, and a good tree branch to hang my food bag from. (I chose not to do any cooking as I'd eaten at the Golden Arches.) I've passed the 1,800-mile mark, another 100-mile milestone. I will only be doing that three more times on the trail. Hard to believe. I am high up in the hills at almost 3,000 feet, and well placed to attack the climbs to Mt Wolf and Kinsman Mtn. tomorrow morning. Jeff said that the terrain is quite decent on Kinsman but he admitted that he hadn't hiked the descent I'll be doing. All will be revealed soon enough.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571119,"I slept for seven hours, apart from one visit to the bushes for a pee at 3:40am, a side effect of the steroids I'm taking. Amazingly, I went back to sleep for a couple of hours. I got on the trail at 8. The climb up Mt Wolf was straightforward, and was followed by the drop down to the Eliza Brook Shelter. I stopped in for a rest and to sign the register. The trail followed the Eliza Brook for almost a mile. There were several pools that beckoned to me and ordinarily I'd have jumped in, but my goal was to get to a campsite another 11 miles away, so I felt I didn't have time to waste. The climb up to Mt Kinsman was very tough. It was bouldery. At times I was having to throw my poles ahead of me and use tree trunks and branches to haul myself up. Inevitably, I fell. And fell again. I was lucky both times to come away with fairly superficial cuts and bruises, although my right hip hurt for the rest of the day. The views from Kinsman were stunning. I wished I had someone knowledgeable with me to show me which of the nearby peaks were on the AT. I struggled on the downhill, which was almost as bad as Moosilauke, with many wooden steps and rebar rungs inserted. Malink caught me and suggested I stay at the AT hut that was coming up. It has a full-time staff, separate cabins for guests, and serves breakfast and dinner. I called in and enquired about a work-for-stay possibility. (I can afford to pay to stay, but I'm intent on doing and trying, at least once, as many separate parts of the AT experience as possible.) So I got free food once all the paying guests were fed, and in return I chipped the ice off the back of the freezer and washed the shelves. Now I'm getting ready to lay out my mattress on the floor and get into my sleeping bag. The only other WFS thru-hiker here is Forrest, whom I last saw a few weeks ago. He's a tattoo artist, and routinely hikes 30-40 miles a day. Milestones: Today was the end of my 15th week on the trail. I dropped under 400 miles to go, and shortly after that passed the 1,800 miles completed mark. I have ascended the equivalent of 13 Everests. I took my 5th and 6th zero days. My average pace to date including zeros is just over 17 miles per day. And I'm finally in the dreaded Whites, and so far they are living up to their reputation for toughness.

But my back left me struggling to sleep as every position seemed uncomfortable. Forrest was gone by around 6, with the intent of getting into the Presidential range of mountains by day's end after a hike of 34 miles. The initial three miles were downhill and followed a river. Much of the trail was easy. It went under an interstate and started the climb from about 1,400 feet to Mt. Lafayette at almost 5,300. It was 6.4 miles. There were many rocky sections but they were not challenging and I was taking it easy. Then the trail broke onto a ridge above the treeline, and the views back towards Mt. Kinsman and forward to some of the linked peaks we would be climbing today were revealed - Little Haystack, Mt. Lincoln and Mt. Lafayette. At last I got to wear my hat again for shade, and my sun shirt got to fulfill its function. The climb along the ridge was by AT standards crowded, with close to thirty day hikers enjoying the exercise, the sun and the views. Billy Goat, who'd been at the hut last night, caught me almost at the start of the ridge, and we hiked together for the rest of the day. He's 59, a retired government worker. He was an advisor on various foreign affairs to Bill Clinton, George Bush and even for a while to Barack Obama. He knows a lot about a lot of political matters. After Mt. Lafayette we had to drop elevation and then climb Mt. Garfield. The drop from that peak was hard and technical, as was the climb back up to reach Galehead Hut. It may have been the longest 2.2 miles of the AT, but that stunning set of peaks and the views they gave us made this day possibly my favorite of the whole AT so far. In total we climbed about 6,200 feet. That may be lower than many days' results in the early part of my AT hike, but the conditions down south did not include the technical rock-climbing we have to do in the Whites (or, indeed, any rock-climbing) and our distances covered were higher. The Hut was not full when we arrived around 7:30. but there were far more guests than last night's hut. I paid to stay. The views of the mountains surrounding us were regal, especially with an almost-full moon presiding. I'm sharing a bunk room with Billy Goat, who swears he doesn't snore.

During the night someone from another bunk room, fed up with another sleeper's snoring, came in and joined Billy Goat and me in our room. Luckily all three of us were non-snorers. We had a leisurely getting-up as breakfast was not until 7. Three of the staff sang a song to guitar accompaniment in the corridor outside the bunk rooms. Breakfast was good and copious. I had four large bowls of cranberry oatmeal with canned peach slices, followed by bacon and lots of scrambled eggs. There was hot chocolate and coffee. When I finally waddled onto the trail, it was 8:15. I hardly needed to eat anything else all day. The day was sunny. There was a steep climb of 1,100 feet almost straight away to the top of South Twin Mountain; it had tricky technical stretches but nothing super-dangerous. At the top I thought I had a phone signal and could update my journal but the signal came and went, and so did I. Once over the summit, there was a long descent to the Zealand Falls Hut. During that phase, I overtook a kilt-wearing and axe-carrying hiker called Medieval. He says that when he comes to smaller downed trees blocking the trail, he chops them up. I stopped to view the falls, and got a hiking couple, Kelly and Kevin, to take my picture there. They were very interested in my hike and asked for my journal details. After I left them, the trail leveled out and became quite enchanting, with nary a root or rock. It felt utterly extraordinary. The trail passed above and then through a boulder field. I met Downward Cow going SOBO. He explained why, but other people's hiking rationales are always so boring, don't you find? So I promptly forgot his explanation. After a couple of miles the trail started to love some of its pristine levelness, but it remained reasonable and was never unwelcome, here in the killer Whites. I had plannned on stopping at a campsite but my time was so good that I decided to press on. I climbed towards Mt Webster, but after about 2,500 feet I came out of the trees onto a panoramic view with the sun setting, and there was a fabulous stealth site in the trees. I trashed my plans and set my tent up right there. Only problem was a lack of trees appropriate for hanging food bags from.

It was Chef Boyardee, whom I had seen yesterday about 30 minutes back on the trail where he'd set up his hammock. I got going about an hour later, at 6:26. It was a day that should have been about the hike and the 6,000 feet of climbing, but food and water dominated. Firstly, I had used up all my water the night before. I woke up very thirsty. The next water was going to be nearly 5 miles away, at Mizpah Hut, after the climbs of Mt Webster and Mt Jackson. I spent a lot of that five miles thinking of water, lemonade, Coke, etc. but I made good time, and survived until Mizpah. When I got there, it was about 9. I got water, and asked about leftovers from breakfast. There was a large bowl of blueberry and coconut oatmeal. I ate it all - about six helpings I'd guess. It was free of charge. I also bought and ate all their cinnamon rolls (3). I went back on the trail feeling much better. The long climb along the ridge to Mt Washington continued. In fairness to the ATC, the AT skipped peaks like Eisenhower. I arrived at the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, which is 1.4 miles down from Mt Washington. It was a busy spot. There I ate another cinnamon roll a SOBO had given me. I also ate a Snickers bar, a square of coffee cake, and a bowl of home-made mushroom soup. The trail up to the peak was through a boulder field and almost every step was tricky. The usual blazes were gone, replaced by cairns of rocks. Clouds came and went. I made it in good time to the top, if you discount the half-hour I spent uploading my journal entries for the last three days, when I discovered that I had a good signal. That may have been because we could see the Breton Woods hotel below us, where the US and the U.K. and maybe others agreed to some currency rules, including the linking of the US dollar to gold, way back in 1944. The Mt Washington peak is at 6,288 feet, the second highest peak on the AT after Clingman's Dome down in North Carolina. As there's a road to it, there were lots of tourists there. I had to queue to get a picture of me with the summit marker. I went to the snack bar and had a real nightmare combination: two ice cream bars, a bag of Doritos, and two slices of pizza, all washed down by a Gatorade. I headed out into the chilly afternoon with my rain jacket on, but quickly shed it as I worked my way down the rock field on the northern face of Mt Washington, with the cog trains going by me regularly, passengers waving. There's apparently a tradition of hikers mooning the train. I opted not to do that. Call me weak. The rest of the day, from about 4 to 7:30, was all about getting over several more peaks to reach Madison Springs Hut. There was gorgeous scenery, with one deep valley to our east containing a small dark lake (reminiscent of Glengariff in Kerry). There was a small snowfield still visible on one slope. The rocks were omnipresent, but at least they were the rounded variety for the most part. Where they weren't, I forgave them, in view of the scenery and the sunshine. I met Papa, an older SOBO with two big elaborately-carved walking sticks; Mix, a slow-moving older chap heading to Madison also, as well as several other day hikers heading towards Mt Washington. Eventually I crested a ridge and there was the hut, a couple of hundred feet below. Chef Boyardee was already there, awaiting his free food. I got a bunk, and then had an enormous dinner of chicken, potatoes, and broccoli, with all the lemonade my little heart could desire. There was apple and peach cobbler for dessert. I'm in my bunk, and I can hardly move.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571518,"After an amazingly good night's sleep at 4,800 feet, and the usual hearty hut breakfast, I took off up Mt Madison at 8:16. There were lots of hikers leaving the hut just before me. All of us heading north were immediately faced with the ascent of the boulder field behind the hut. It was quite a sight, all those people bent forward, leaning into the slope and using their poles for balance. It reminded me of the photograph of the long line of would-be gold miners going up the mountain during the Alaskan gold rush. There was a big group of Boy Scouts. After reaching the top, you could look back to see Mt Washington, and forward to see the trail follow the ridgeline, its path marked by cairns.
The trail eventually dipped below the treeline and onto the infamous Osgood Trail, steep and rocky. Soon after the descent began, I fell and pitched forward. I've learned not to wear my pole straps around my wrists during tricky ascents and descents, which is 90% of the time lately, as that allows me to drop the poles if I fall. This helps stop me from breaking or bending the poles, and allows me more freedom to use my hands to protect me. In this instance, it was my forearms that took the fall, and although I banged my forehead on a rock, it was just a graze. I was considerably shaken, so much so that Mix was able to catch up with me, despite being much older than me (59; 60 in October). But I recovered and was able to resume my usual pace.
At the Mt Washington Auto Rd, I met Camo and his assistant Pokey, doing a survey for the AMC. Camp keeps the trail signs in the area up to date. I was happy to hear that the white blazes would recommence almost at once; they've been missing for the last few miles. The day was very sunny when I reached Pinkham Notch. I crossed the road and started the 2000-foot climb of Wildcat Mtn. It was tough and technical, and took me almost three hours. I abandoned my plans for a 20-mile day. A thunderstorm started up and delivered some rain. When I finally crested the summit, the trail's rocks were slippery and the going was slow. It was a relief to see the Carter Notch Hut appear around 7:30. There was no one I knew there, and I seemed to be the sole NOBO thru-hiker present.

At breakfast they told me that it had been too cloudy to see anything. I spent the half hour before breakfast sewing a pocket back onto my hiking shorts - it had been ripped off during my fall yesterday. At breakfast I at first was concerned that the quantity of food would not meet my needs, but the staff kept on bringing me extra until I was satisfied. I chatted to a couple outside the hut while I repaired some tears in a stuff sack with hut duct tape. The husband turned out to be Daragh, from Ireland, married to Christine. They had their two little girls with them, Adia and Aisling. Sitting in the sun, having a good conversation - before I knew it, it was 9am and I had to get rolling. It was 9:16 before I got back on the trail. There was the normal hard climb, in this case 1,500 feet, to get to the first peak, Carter Dome, at over 4,800 feet. It was not very technical and I felt really strong doing it. That led to a series of peaks. In fact, I met several hikers doing the 4,000 series - trying to climb all 48 of the peaks in NH that are 4,000 feet or higher. The weather was perfect. I have beeng truly blessed with sunshine for nearly all of my time on the Whites and Presidentials. After Carter Dome came Mt Hight and Middle Carter Mountain, and on the descent from the latter I ran into Martha, whose son had done the AT and as a result she was carrying extra food for thru-hikers. I enjoyed grapes, a ham and cheese wrap, and a hardboiled egg, while standing talking to her in the trail. Shortly afterwards I hit Imp Campsite, which had been my planned destination for last night before Wildcat destroyed me. I had heard that they had great cell coverage there, and that turned out to be the case. I met Irene, the caretaker, who looked very young. I didn't want to take the time to catch up on my trail journal, but fired off a few messages to my wife, and agreed with her on a target date for a rendezvous in Monson, Maine, with my son. That will require 15-mile days until then. I called my friend and relative Des in Waterford, Ireland. Amongst other things, he was delighted to tell me that Waterford had defeated Kilkenny in hurling, knocking them out of the running for the All-Ireland, and leaving six counties still in the running, including , Galway (my father's county), and Waterford. Now I know this news would have made at least one of my readers in Boston dolefully sad, but them's the breaks, Mary! After Imp came the climb up to Mt Moriah. The views back to My Washington and its neighbors were gorgeous. From there it was downhill for four fairly easy miles (a few technical spots but they were not like Moosilauke!), hitting the Rattle River eventually and the nicest stretch of flat riverside trail since the trail after Zealand Falls. I met Brick, doing a section. He said the chat with me was his first real conversation since he hit the trail. I also met a SOBO, who recorded a brief interview with me. He is doing the same with all 'NOBO thrus' he meets. At a stream I had a long chat with Aaron and Alexia, two young SOBOs. Then it was time for the last mile or two on the flat into Rattle River Shelter. A large group of teenagers had commandeered all the official tent spots but I found a decent, if slightly sloping, location up the hill a little bit. It had a perfect tree for my bag. I cooked my food and went down for a bath and swim in the river. It was cold!

For a while, I will have constant reminders of her; every time I look at my hands or elbows or legs and see the scabs healing from all the scratches and scrapes, I will remember her. But the gorgeous mountaintop vistas, the kindness of its people, the effectiveness of its hut system, and the outrageously good spell of weather in the Whites, all combined to make this state my favorite so far.But to recap the day: I set out at 7:44. The day was overcast. The humidity was 100%. The trail continued for a while to be almost flat. It was a day of milestones. Within ten minutes of starting out, I had breached the 300-miles-remaining mark. I walked on a road for a while, passing a hydroelectric power plant on a river. Then the road tilted upwards as the climb to the top of Mt Hayes began. It was a net 1700 feet, but felt like more. There were no (or almost no) technical sections; it harked back to the tough climbs in Georgia and North Carolina, where all you needed was strength and endurance. It felt like honest effort and no unreasonable demands. Just step, push up; step, push up. In total today, I climbed about 6,400 feet.In the humidity, I sweated buckets. There were many springs and streams today, though, and I drank at every one and kept one bottle filled for the stretches between water sources. The conquest of Mt Hayes at 2,555 feet was followed by those of Cascade Mountain, Trident Col (2020), and a few unnamed minor peaks scattered along a ridge. I stopped along the way when I saw I had service and updated my trail journal for the previous two days. I got a text from Rooster who is close behind me. There was another milestone in the early afternoon when I hit mile 1,900. I saw no sign signaling it.I ran into 60/40, a flip-flopper who says we met when he was doing Georgia and North Carolina with his sister-in-law. I have no recollection of meeting him. His male companion now, he said, was exhausted by the trail. As we were talking, his friend passed us without a word, and from the state of his shorts (muddy streaks, one back pocket almost ripped off), you could see he'd been scrambling on his butt down some descents). He found a flat rock a few yards past us and lay down on it.The net 1,400-foot climb to the top of Mt Success (3565) had some tricky stretches but, like Hayes, felt fair. The drop down and the climb up to the border with Maine was, however, challenging in many places. There was one outrageous section where I stopped and yelled ""Mammy!"" And the final stinger, a vicious little section of massive boulders reminiscent of the Lemon Squeezer way back when, saw me pull out the twelve feet of rope my friend Tom had helped me buy near Squam Lake just over a week ago and use it to lower my backpack over a ledge and follow it gingerly. That section, a small preparation for the monster that is Mahoosuc Notch tomorrow, occurred within feet of the sign for the Carlo Col Shelter, where I pulled in for the night. There were tent platforms (which I am now adept at using sans stakes). I took the one furthest away from the shelter, past a group of three tents filled with giggling teenage girls. In the shelter were Tuff Broad and Bear Sweatz, whom I last saw several weeks ago. I cooked Idahoan potatoes for dinner, accidentally dumping in twice the amount of turmeric I usually administer. If it has the healing properties it is credited with, sure I'll be Superman tomorrow.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572148,"I started the day early and was hiking by 7:26. The weather was glorious. I think Maine and New Hampshire have tried to make up for all the lousy weather in their sister states down south. But it was also a tough day. I climbed 5,600 feet. Since shelters are almost always built down in the gaps between mountains, I faced the climb out of Carlo Col to the top of Mt Carlo straight away. That was easy enough. Then there were the various peaks of Goose Eye Mountain to conquer. The views were [awesome; gorgeous; stunning; incredible; or, God help us, 'nice'*]. As I was negotiating my way through yet another swampy peat big on top of one of the Gooses, I chose to play it the AT way and rely on the semi-submerged plank in the middle of the morass rather than hug the edges and widen the trail, like everybody else. Well, everybody else didn't end up discovering that the plank was basically floating on the mud, and sliding off into four feet of turf soup. I did. [Minor digression here: these Maine mountains often smell like the turf bogs of Ireland. My mother says her happiest days were spent on the bog saving turf for the fireplace. My brothers and I would strongly disagree. We hated the bog and particularly the midges, a smaller but more vicious version of the black flies here in Maine. Our happiest memories of the bog were when our dad would say ""Okay, that's enough for today.""]I overtook the famous Highlander from Dundee (who hikes in a kilt) and his lady partner. At Speck Pond Shelter, I washed off my pants leg. Then a little ways further, and here it was at last, the most-discussed part of the trail, Mahoosuc Notch. In the guidebook it is described as ""the most difficult or fun mile of the AT. Make way through jumbled pit of boulders."" Imagine a very narrow valley with cliffs on both sides. Boulders have fallen in over the millennia. You have to find a way through. There is no 'path'. You stow your poles. You pull yourself up one boulder only to find that to move on you have to jump to another, and it is sloping towards you, or away. Two minutes into the Notch and the air is 20 degrees cooler. Extraordinary. At least you are no longer sweating. Then you see the snow and ice piled up under rocks and in little caves. Where a breeze occurs, you can see a dragon's breath of fog curling out of crevices. A meltwater stream gurgles and you can fill your bottle with the coldest, clearest water you've seen in months. Three times you have to finesse your way through tunnels under the rocks, and for two of them you have to drag your backpack behind you. Once, you grab a moss-covered root for support, only to have it give way and leave you lying on your back wedged between two rocks; you have to unbuckle your backpack to return to an upright position. You're glad nobody is on hand with a camera. And eventually, one hour and fifty-seven minutes later, you emerge from the Notch. You've read in the registers that others did it in 36 or 45 minutes but you've hiked your own hike and are unscathed. You actually had fun.From the Notch I climbed the long relentless 1,600 feet to the top of Mahoosuc Arm, past Speck Pond Shelter which was crowded with youth groups, and up to the highest point the AT goes on Old Speck mountain (4023). I met Will, a youth group leader with about ten kids, one of whom was suffering from breathing difficulties but had no inhaler. We chatted for a while in low voices about his options. I left feeling I should be staying with them to offer whatever assistance I could but it wasn't clear what use I could be. I hope they made it to the shelter they were aiming for.The 3.5-mile plunge back down to Grafton Notch (1495) was a blur of rock and mud in fading light. Near the Notch I met Downward Cow, who had passed me earlier in the day. He has a deadline to finish on Katahdin by the 23rd so that he can join his fiancée in Washington DC for apartment-hunting. That's aggressive. He had intended to get to the Baldpate Lean-to but got tired and was camping just before Grafton Notch. I continued on and eventually had to resort to my headlamp to light my way up to Baldpate. I reached it at 10:09, which I think is my latest arrival since I started the AT. I set up tent, got water (had to use Guthook to find my way back to the shelter from the stream), cooked two batches of food, took a shower and crawled into bed around 1.It's the end of another week on the trail. Milestones: Passed the 1,900-mile mark (and, for our Europeans, I'd like to note that I passed the 3,000-km mark); dipped below the 300-miles-to-go mark; completed my 14th Everest; crossed from New Hampshire into Maine; moved into albums beginning with 'D' on my iPod; did the most difficult mile of the AT; climbed for the last time above 6,000 feet and over 5,000 for the last time until Katahdin; and loaded the final map of the AT on Guthook.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572253,"I was awake around 5 as usual and had a brief word with Tuff Broad and Bear Sweatz before they headed out. I will probably never see them again (although never is a long time). The climb out of Baldpate Lean-to up to the top of the west peak of Baldpate mountain was steep, and I was exhausted by my efforts of the previous day. The last section was over bare rock and very steeply pitched - a fairly safe but grueling climb. At the top I had cell coverage and did my usual email checks and messages. From the top one could see the trail ahead leading to the east peak. I gradually was feeling better. But it was terribly humid and in the area of Frye Notch Lean-to, my phone was acting up, messing with my ability to call for a shuttle to Andover. I climbed the hill after the shelter and succeeded in making the call. I agreed a 2:30 pick-up on the next road crossing with Naomi at Pine Ellis hostel. That was four miles and two hours away, so I put my head down and 'booked it' to the meeting point, passing the scenic Dunn Notch and Falls on the way. I got to the road a little early. But there was no car waiting. There was no cell coverage. There was almost no traffic. So I waited. At just after 3:00, a shuttle van driven by an elderly woman, Gloria, showed up and took me the eight miles to Pine Ellis. There was no apology for the late pick-up and I said nothing. The hostel was a private house with a section devoted to guests - all of whom were hikers. I showered, borrowed some loaner shorts and a t-shirt so that I could throw everything in the laundry, and connected by text message with Fin Phelan. Fin, an Irish emigrant to Cape Cod, where he has a landscaping business in Hyannisport, has been an ardent follower of my blog. He even called me when I was very low on my zero day back in Dalton/Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to offer some advice and words of encouragement. He was now driving with his wife to meet me and join me on the hike. I went to the local ice-cream store. There I dispatched three double cones of ice cream in short order, to the amazement of a nearby table of four elderly locals. My favorite flavor was Maine blueberry, but the strawberry wasn't bad either. From there I made a visit to the general store for a few resupply and beer items, as my hike had ended with an almost-empty food bag (one Knorr pasta meal remained). I drank five beers while in my room. I ordered pizza from the general store and walked there to pick it up. Unusually for me, I wasn't able to finish it. Fin showed up at 10pm. He's tall (6' 4""), muscular from years of amateur boxing, and an avid hiker. I said hello to his wife Alison, who didn't delay but turned around and headed off for Portland where she was overnighting on the return journey. Alison had bought me a huge amount of food - grapes, oranges, apples, water flavoring, Snickers, M&Ms, meals, etc. Fin and I chatted until 1 and turned in.

After a good breakfast at the general store, we packed up and by 8:00 were being shuttled to the AT. Fin opted for the entire day to let me lead and described himself as my disciple. The rain persisted through midday. The trail was rocky and tree-rooty for the entire distance we covered (18.8 miles). The tree-roots were often very slippery. I began to rack up an impressive number of falls. They started on the long 5-mile climb up 1,500 feet on Wyman Mountain (no views, just cloud). There was a steep and very technical climb up Moody (another 1,500) and a corresponding drop down to Black Brook, which was swollen by the rain. I should have simply walked across the river-bed, as my boots were already soaked, but tried to emulate Fin, who skillfully hopped from rock to rock (several of them submerged slightly). I slipped on the second-last rock and fell into the river face-first. I was soaked from head to toe. Fin darted back to grab one of my poles, which was floating away. I put on my windcheater jacket to avoid getting chilled and we proceeded up Old Blue Mountain, a massive 2,200-foot climb and very challenging in the rain. Fin was beginning to tire a little as he hasn't hiked since February. I lost track of how many times I fell. The falls were all 'soft' falls onto my pack or into foliage to the side of the trail. Fin said that my boots - purchased when I was in Connecticut - had inadequate tread and were partly the reason for my misery. We pushed up Bemis Mountain and saw a glorious sunset over the lakes and valleys to our west. The last 3.5 miles to Bemis Mountain Lean-to were interminable. Even Fin was falling as fatigue took its toll. I slid down a rock-face and finally suffered some consequences in the form of a grazed elbow and wrist. We stumbled into the lean-to at 9:53. Fin struggled to put up his tent, and after we both were set up, we got water using his fantastic and fast pump-action water filter.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572259,"I was awake shortly before 5. I spent a lot of time typing up several days' worth of entries for my journal, to be uploaded once I have an internet connection. Fin and I were back on the trail by 8:58. The profile for the hike looked quite moderate, with only one significant climb.
We made decent progress early on and had reasonable expectations of achieving our aggressive target of 19.5 miles. A couple of miles into the hike we had to ford Bemis Stream. After my debacle at Black at yesterday, I took the precaution of changing into my plastic camp shoes and was then able to walk through the river, which was wide but mostly less than a foot deep. Fin, of course, hopped from rock to rock to get across. He has the advantage of waterproof boots. The issue with boots that don't let in water is that they also don't let it out. So if water gets in over the top of your boots, or if your feet sweat, you may be stuck with wet feet all day. The trail was very accommodating all morning, with flat rock or leafy root-free sections. Just after 11, we came to a woods road where Teddie and Snowman had set up a major trail magic station, with several folding chairs, and serving up hot dogs, burgers, bananas, chips and sodas. They drive 70 miles to this spot twice a week. We stayed there for over an hour and could have stayed longer. But we needed to press on. The trail began to become less and less friendly. Big tracts of mud, slippery roots, and rocky ups and downs began to slow us down. Fin's right knee was sore from a fall yesterday and he was suffering on the downhills. It started to rain. We gave up on the goal of making it Piazza Rock Lean-to. When we reached the Little Swift River Pond Campsite, we hurried to set up our tents but unfortunately the rain began to bucket down and I spent a lot of time mopping up when I crawled in. I ate some food that did not require cooking and curled up in my sleeping bag. I was asleep by 8:30.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572261,"The rain had stopped by the time I awoke. Fin called to me from his tent when he heard me on the move. His hip rash was infected, he couldn't straighten his left leg, and his clothes were almost all wet. He was therefore going to have a late start, hike to the next road crossing five miles away, and head to Rangeley and home. He wished me well, and gave me some food and a loan of his water filter.
I was on the trail by 7:11. It was overcast. The rain had exacerbated the muddiness and wetness of the trail. I cruised to the crossing, scrawling little notes of encouragement for Fin in the mud along the way. My intent was to get all the way to Spaulding Mountain Lean-to, for a hike of 24.2 miles. But there was too much difficult climbing and descending. First came a relatively benign 2,500-foot climb up to the top of Saddleback Mountain, at 4,120. The sun came out as I was approaching the summit and the views of the lakes below were impressive. The short drop and climb up to The Horn followed. The descent of The Horn was very dangerous, with damp rocks causing me to slip numerous times. It was the same for Saddleback Junior, and while I was on that peak, the rain came back (although it stopped soon afterwards). I am getting thoroughly fed up with these technical slopes. ""A Walk in The Woods"" - huh! More like ""A Scramble over Rocks"". Seriously, I think the ratio of rock-trail to leaf-trail must by now be 4:1. As I was descending Junior, I called ahead to a motel on Stratton and booked myself a room for tomorrow night. Chef Boyardee came along as I was putting my pack back on. We ambled the last mile to Poplar Ridge Lean-to and managed to find tiny tent sites to squeeze our tents onto.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572270,"My goal today was to get to the town of Stratton for a resupply and a motel room for the night. That would require a hike of 21.5 miles. In Virginia or many other states, that would have been an unremarkable mileage. But here in Maine, the terrain would make that a huge target. So I started my hike at 6:05.
The first order of business was a 1,500-foot descent to Orbeton Stream. It was a rocky and slow crawl down at about 1mph. Funnily enough, the corresponding 1,500-foot climb up Lone Mountain was probably at a faster pace! I stopped off for a half-hour at Spaulding Mountain Lean-to for lunch. Just 1.7 miles later, I passed through the 200 miles-to-go mark. There was another rock-infested mini-Mahoosuc Notch to go down to get to the South Branch Carrabassett River. The views across the valley to the next ridge were very beautiful. While I rested at the river, Chef Boyardee caught up with me. He decided to stop for water and food while I continued on. The twin peaks of South and North Crocker Mountain awaited me. All day, SOBOs had been warning me that South Crocker would be a near-vertical climb. In the event, it was certainly steep and got my heartbeat up to 100+, but there was no really technical section. Chef caught up with me again and stayed with me, although he has the legs to leave me in his dust. After North Crocker came a long 5.2-mile, almost 3,000-foot descent to the road to Stratton. It rained for twenty minutes as we began the descent, just enough to ensure that rocks and tree roots were appropriately slick. There were very few difficult sections. But my feet had been wet for most of the day, and in the last half-hour, I began to develop blisters. I was almost prostrate by the time we hit the 2,000-mile mark, and was so tired that I didn't even pull out my phone to take a photo. At the trailhead I called the motel, and our pickup by the manager, Tree Hugger, took place 20 minutes later. While we waited, I was able to FaceTime my wife and son to discuss meeting him in Monson in a few days' time. We were so late (it was after 8pm) and it was a Sunday, so by the time we got to town, everything was closed. I went to my room for a shower and ate the rest of my food, while Chef went to the bunk room where he was staying and where there was food in the fridge. I updated several days'-worth of trail journals, hand-washed my trail clothes, and set my devices to recharging. My poor iPod seems to be checking out and I can't get it to play. A sad little casualty of the trail.

I rousted Chef from bed to get breakfast at The Loose Moose. Tori, a ridge runner, gave us a lift there. I had three breakfasts - biscuits and gravy, eggs and ham, and a large stack of blueberry pancakes. Elaine, our waitress, was a bit taken aback. From there we walked back to a grocery store to buy resupply items. I packed and was ready to leave but Chef needed to charge his phone so I left. I weighed my pack - it was 47 pounds, four of them water. I was hitching a lift when Rob, the morning manager at the motel, came by with Tori and gave me a ride. I was back hiking by 11:14. The first order of business was climbing up onto the Bigelow ridge, a 2,000-foot slog. It was hot and humid. I sweated buckets. But the climb was honest toil, with good trail and few spoilers like rock tumbles to break the rhythm. It was steep, and I stopped many times to get my heart-rate down and to refill my water. In the mid-afternoon there was a thunderstorm but it missed me. There was a terrific view of two mountains with a lake nestled at the foot of them   - North Horn and South Horn, and Horns Pond. Beyond them lay Bigelow Mountain West Peak. I traversed all three peaks, and at Bigelow, Chef finally caught me and persuaded me to call it a day before the oncoming thunderstorm could hit. We dashed to the Avery Memorial Campsite a few hundred yards down the mountain. I set up my tent on a platform just as the rain hit. I dived into it before I could get too wet. Later, when there was a lull, I tracked down the privy and then went for water but it was too far away across a rock jumble. The storm returned. I was changing into my night clothes in my tent when a bolt of lightning struck very close by, and I heard someone running towards me. It was a young female SOBO, Bias, who was in some distress. I got her to open a vestibule and crawl in out of the rain. It was rather bizarre. We had a pleasant chat. I lent her my rain jacket to help her get warm and we waited for the next break in the storm, at which point she ran off to set up her tent on the nearest available platform. I cooked some food with a small quantity of water I had. My two chores for the evening were sewing up my wretched pants pocket (again), this time with stronger thread I'd found in the hiker box at the motel, and supergluing a crack in my water filter which I'd been holding together with duct tape.

Being on a platform helped. Poor Chef had disdained the use of a platform, and unfortunately where he chose to set up turned into a big puddle. He had water in his tent. I got hiking late, at 8:58, despite me having an aggressive target to meet to put me back on track to meet my son on the 21st in Monson. I did 1 mph for the first three hours due to the terrain. There was a cruel rock jumble as soon as you hit the trail, but it was mercifully short. Twenty minutes after setting out, I was summitting Avery Peak. Then it was a tough slog down rocky paths until the long climb up to the last real peak of the AT before Katahdin, Little Bigelow. Along the way I was overtaken by Chef, and then by a group consisting of Lucky, Leaf, and Lioness. Just yesterday I'd been saying that two more dry days would clear up the mudholes along the trail, but last night's rain put paid to that. Around 3 pm, thunder began rolling, and soon rain was bucketing down. In the midst of the lightning, who should come up but Sweet Spot and Leaf. I last saw Sweet Spot somewhere in Georgia. We hugged in the rain. The two of them raced off. I plodded on, getting sicker of the mud with every stride. I thought about just keeping going into the night but saw in Guthook that there was a sandy lake beach at my 19-mile mark, and some tenting spots near it. So I stopped there. I found Lucky and Lioness already there. I filled up with water at the beach. I was tempted to go for a swim until I saw leeches swimming in the water. Bummer. The plaintive call of the loon is sounding across the lake. The mosquitoes are buzzing around my tent. I'm bushed, but I'm fed and watered and ready for sleep.

The only sketchy bit was walking across the logs and planks on top of a wooden dam at the outlet of Pierce Pond. Before midday I had reached the Kennebec River and took the ferry (a canoe) over. On the far side, I went for a swim, mainly to wash the sweat out of my clothes, as it had turned into a warm day.Immediately after the ferry was the Caratunk B&B. A whole crowd of hikers was there, including Lioness, Lucky, Sweet Spot, Chef, and Leaf. Paul, the genial owner, invited us to eat if we wished in his dining room. I had two of the juiciest burgers I've ever enjoyed. I also had two milk shakes, three mandarin oranges, a muffin and a big slice of coffee cake. I lingered over an hour and then pressed on. The almost 2,000-foot climb up Pleasant Pond Mountain was anything but. Night fell as I descended to Baker Stream. I chatted briefly with two night fishermen on the river before I crossed it, hopping from rock to rock by the light of my headlamp. I found a stealth site just 100 yards up the AT from the river.

This has happened before, but it was particularly irritating this time, given how little spare time I have on the AT.

I took the wrong way back to the camp and was quite fed up of mountain biking by the time I made it there. I ate the half-gallon of ice-cream, drank a bottle of beer and the bottle of red wine I'd bought, and so was quite mellow by the time Phil came back with Aidan. It was a very emotional reunion. Phil joined us for a group hug. Aidan and I sat on the porch of our cabin having a beer. Then I took a shower and we both grabbed bikes and rode to town. We had dinner at the Lakeshore Restaurant, where the service was the slowest I've ever experienced. We met Sparky, whom I haven't seen since shortly after Harpers Ferry. By the time we left, it was dark and we took our chances on the dirt road, but it all went well. Phil took me to the lounge cabin to agree logistics for resupply and picking us up from Katahdin.

We were both worried that Aidan's foot problems would affect our mileage, and with 89.8 miles left, and effectively only four days to do the first 84.6 of those, any reductions in planned miles would cause us problems in getting to Katahdin in time.  But Aidan turned out to be in good form. We vaulted up Columbus Mountain. He took the lead up Chairback Mountain, which we'd been warned was rocky and rooty. There was one stretch coming down which was a huge rock jumble, and we took it slowly and carefully. As a result, our mph was low - roughly 1.5. But from that point on, we cruised. There was some lovely flat trail, and we were hitting 3 mph for long stretches. We met Josh and Butterbuck coming south on day 2 of their two-day assault on the length of the Wilderness. They looked fresh and in good spirits, but had not slept, instead had continued hiking to Monson from Abol Bridge. They complained about the trail messing them up, but said that we would find that after Whitecap Mountain the trail was a beauty. On Katahdin Ironworks Road, we found a large group being resupplied. We scored some trail magic - surplus meals, biscuits and tortillas. Shortly afterwards we had to ford West Branch Pleasant River. Aidan did so barefoot as he has no camp shoes. We timed ourselves and found that the crossing cost us 13 minutes. Then came the quadrifecta - four mountains in swift succession - Gulf Hagas, West Peak, Hay, and White Cap. Each was a bit higher than the one before it. Aidan led superbly. On White Cap I took the time to upload three days' worth of trail journals. Aidan was getting too cold for us to delay further. As we were leaving, we saw a painted sign on the ground saying ""View"" and pointing us to the north. From the viewing point we were able to see, away off in the distance, Katahdin. We continued on another two miles, and arrived at our goal for the day - a piped spring, and nearby, a stealth site. It had rained from the time we left White Cap, and after getting loads of water, Aidan and I coordinated our actions to get our tent set up in record time and fairly dry inside. We cooked ramen noodles, while I also ate tuna in tortillas. We added flavors to our drinking water to make it more appealing. I was massively disappointed to discover that the one thing I'd totally forgotten to resupply was Snickers bars. We were both in our sleeping bags with lights out by 10:30.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573218,"Aidan was a reluctant riser this morning. But when we got going, he was fine. It was at first cloudy, but later in the morning, sun and blue sky started to appear. We were on the trail by 7:34. With a target of 21.5 miles to reach today and for each of the next two days, we did not dawdle. There were two relatively minor climbs to get us to the top of Little Boardman Mountain at 1980 feet. After that, the trail began its long descent on flat ground. At its most complicated there were rock falls and jumbles to overcome, but these were few and far between. At the top of Little Boardman, I found I had good coverage and stopped to do the three entries I still had outstanding in order to get my trail journal up to date. We were constantly battling mosquitoes. I was reasonably safe from them, in my long hiking pants and long-sleeved sun shirt, but Aidan kept being attacked. Once we were over Boardman, our speed picked up. Aidan led. Although not 100% recovered from the foot pains he had two days ago, he is strong and able to hike fast and long. We encountered trail magic after a couple of miles, from a hiker and her hiker son who had arranged way too much food for their resupply and gave us a lot of it. It included Snickers bars, a couple of meals, and umpteen energy bars. We covered the 8.3 miles to Jo-Mary Road at a 4 mph rate. There, we picked up our resupply food from Phil Pepin's lockbox. Aidan had to take some of it as I had maxed out what I could squeeze into my backpack. (Yesterday I had taken all the food he was carrying in order to give him as light a pack as possible.) At the Antlers Campsite, we found Rock Spider, Powerhouse and Wonder Woman. They had a lovely campsite by a lake, and I would have liked to join them. However, to keep us on target to reach the Katahdin base by Thursday night, we had to press on for 3.5 miles more to the Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to. There we got a nice site close to the spring. There were gazillions of mosquitoes so we opted to cook in our tent. I lanced a blister on Aidan's foot for him and then patched it up with - what else? - Leukotape!
Milestones in the past week: I passed the 100-miles-to-go and the 2,100-miles-walked marks. I have done 97.7% of the AT. I've done more than 15 Everests. My average mileage per day is just a hair below 17. I have now completed nearly all the mountains of the AT, apart from the climb up Katahdin on the last day. And of course, I saw Katahdin for the first time, a speck on the distant horizon. I'm coming for you!","Logan Brook Road, ME

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573491,"There are many scenic views along the AT. They are part of the reason for hiking the trail. But eventually they begin to follow a pattern: distant green ridges; rows of mountains fading from darker blue to distant pale blue; waterfalls of differing height and width and angle of descent; pretty lakes. Some hikers stop taking photographs of them - I know that I take fewer with every passing week. A sign pointing off the trail saying ""Scenic overlook - 0.3 miles"" is likely to be overlooked as too much of an investment for probably insufficient return. But here I am today perched on a narrow rock outcrop, a little ways off the trail, on top of a small mountain, and I am looking at a scenic view that in some ways captures it all - it's sunny, and there's a beautiful calm lake below, with wilderness woods all around. But dominating the scene is a ridge of mountains, the highest elevations we've seen since the Whites, and the highest one, at the end of the ridge, 16 miles away as the crow flies, is what has been to me almost a mythical creature - what the Penobscot tribe called 'The Greatest Mountain'. It is Katahdin.Aidan may have turned 20 in April, but in many ways he's still a teenager. Getting him ambulatory in the morning is a lengthy process. He will ask for extra snoozing time. He will say he's getting up but you'd need to be Sherlock Holmes to find evidence of it, if it were true. This morning was no exception. Everybody else had left the shelter before we did. This does my competitive juices just no good at all. 7:54? What kind of time is that, with a target of 22 miles to meet?First of all, I have to head out of the shelter the way we came in, rejoin the trail, and circle around the shelter until I pick up the blue-blazed trail leading to the trail from our tent-site, to avoid missing that small piece of the trail between the entrance to and the exit from the shelter and invalidating the purity of my AT experience. (Of course, we won't talk about Charlie's Bunion down south, when I went off-trail for a view and returned to the trail further north than where I'd left it.) Today's hike led us past many ponds, lakes, rivers and waterfalls. We saw lots of other hikers, both NOBOs and SOBOs. We kept running into Coins, an Essex man who is returning to England, after section-hiking from Harpers Ferry, to become a lawyer. Poor chap. I felt like warning him, but he is set on being doomed. We also met Zebra several times. She's a young lady from Poland who travels at a seemingly tranquil pace, stopping to take swims and long lunches, yet annoyingly is always overtaking us when we stop for the most trifling reason, like blowing our noses. She started on March 29, so she has really chewed up the miles from Georgia.Aidan continued to suffer from knee problems on descents. He even resorted to my old trick of going down backwards. Luckily there were not too many downhill stretches. We had to climb up Nesuntabunt Mountain, which peaks at just over 1,500 feet. We had dismissed it when we studied it on the map, but climbing the rocky gorges to the top got my heart rate elevated and it was not at all a 'nothing' climb. It was from near its peak that we saw Katahdin, still 36.3 AT miles away.Going down, Aidan was in such pain that I took his backpack on top of mine for ten minutes. When he objected, I said that it gave me boasting rights on my trail journal. ""But that makes me look weak"", he protested. I didn't object too strenuously when he said the trail had leveled out and I could relinquish his backpack. At that point, we had 8.8 miles left of our 22. Ordinarily that would have taken us 4.4 hours. But the trail was mostly flat, although with tree roots obstructing the way for most of it. Aidan went into hyperdrive, and at every waypoint where I could measure our progress, we were topping 3 mph. Just try doing that for almost 9 miles with a heavy backpack on a hot, humid day. He said it made him miss his cross country running days. I said it made me miss riding in cars, or being moved anywhere by drivers of buses or taxis or trains, or by pilots of aircraft.We whanged into the campsite ahead of schedule, shattered. It is right by a lake, with a spring providing cold, clear water. We both guzzled bottles of it, unfiltered. I guzzled tons of food. The mosquitoes guzzled on us. We hid in our tent and listened to their predatory high-pitched buzzing. Thank goodness for bug spray, leggings and headnets. Tomorrow we journey to the base of Katahdin; on Friday, we climb to the peak. The long march north is almost over.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573493,"During the night and early morning, it rained. When I emerged from our tent to go to the privy, I found a note left on a rock beside us - ""Butterfeet says Hi"". So he did not give up when he left the trail to go see some colleges. While I was in our tent, having breakfast, Coins came by to say goodbye.Aidan and I only got going at 8:56. The trail continued to be mostly flat, with tree roots. Aidan's knees were both painful and I worried that he would grind to a halt. But in the first hour he produced 1.5 miles, which I extrapolated to an 11pm finish. Not pretty, but at least I wouldn't have to leave him with the tent and food to make his own way, and hike through the night to reach the camp early in the morning for the climb up Katahdin. We had one nice climb up to Rainbow Ledges at just over 1,500 feet. Along the way we paused to eat the tiny succulent Maine blueberries that grow in profusion along the trail at the peaks. If somebody entered the 100-Mile Wilderness with no food, they could probably make it to the far side by subsisting on those berries. Mind you, they are so small that you'd spend hours each day foraging. Plus, they are on small, ground-hugging bushes, and foraging for them involves a lot of bending over, something that a heavy backpack makes strenuous. At the Rainbow Ledges we had a very clear view of Katahdin. The exit from the Wilderness is rather uncelebrated, but I took a photograph of a sign warning hikers entering from that direction that they needed to be carrying at least ten days' supply of food since there would be no possibility of resupply until Monson. Of course, we'd seen hikers resupplying at several logging road crossings (and we'd done so ourselves), or waiting to be picked up, so the concept of an untracked wilderness needs some modification.We trudged along a dusty gravel road across the Abol Bridge. Right beside it was The Northern Restaurant. We stopped there for lunch. I ordered a pitcher of pink lemonade, which threw the waitress for a loop, but the manager okayed it. But it came half-full of ice. I prefer ice-free drinks generally, and with all the weight I've lost, it only takes a couple of cold drinks for my core temperature to drop precipitously, and I start shivering and searching for my warm jacket. Fat is a great insulator. For my second pitcher, I asked for no ice, which required a fresh consultation with the manager before it could be delivered. I had a poutine to start, followed by a tuna panini, while Aidan predictably had a burger and fries. At the next table were Sugar, Cirque (who had tented beside us the previous evening), and Zebra. When the others left, I invited Zebra to join us at our table. She talked about her job as a journalist back in Poland, and what she intended to do in the US until the date of her return flight - it involves a lot of hitchhiking. When Aidan and I set out to complete the afternoon leg of our day's hike, she and Cirque joined us. Cirque lives in Brooklyn and is a manic talker, whose main conversational style is a shoot-from-the-hip, stream of consciousness format that is funny but in time tiring. We reached the start of Baxter State Park and signed a register, and the sign-up sheet for the thru-hikers' shelter at the foot of Katahdin. The mosquitoes were so bad that I skimped on filling in some fields on both forms, and Aidan and I ran for it. We had 9 miles to go, and at a 2 mph pace, that would have left us reaching the campsite around 9 pm. So once again we went into hyperdrive and reached the camp by 7:30. Coins was already there, in his sleeping bag in a shelter, along with one other hiker. I set up our tent on the sole platform that I could see. Sugar, Cirque and Zebra trailed in over the next hour. While we were having our late dinner, a park ranger came by to register us, collect the $10 fee per person, and issue us with our permits to hike Katahdin. Shortly after we went to bed, it started to rain, and Aidan and I scrambled to ensure backpacks, boots, etc. were under cover in our respective vestibules.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573498,"It was a standard morning start for me, at least as far as putting on damp or wet clothes was concerned. In view of the condition of his knees, Aidan had decided to stay in the tent and rest while I climbed Katahdin. I packed my sleeping bag, mattress, and anything else I could into my backpack. I put my rain jacket, warm jacket,  jersey, some food and a couple of water bottles into a food bag and walked to the ranger station to sign the trail register and pick up a day pack. My entry in the register was a little corny, but brief: "" - it's been a long way.""
The day was opening with sunny conditions and lots of blue sky mixed with cloud.  I met Butterfeet arriving with a sister and his dad, who were going to accompany him as far as they could. We hugged and wished each other well. I headed to the trail, and for the last time noted my day's start time: 7:15. At the head of the trail was Tori, an AT employee, checking that I knew the AT code of Leave No Trace, the location of the last toilet, and that I'd signed the trailside register.
The climb up was actually preceded by a stretch of dead flat, gravel path that all too soon turned into a more standard AT rock-strewn path up an incline past the Katahdin Stream Falls. The rocks began to be more frequent and bigger, and before long I was hauling myself up using tree branches, choosing my footholds and pole plants with care, and wondering once again how on earth 80-year-old Bucky would get over these obstacles. The trees began to disappear. I overtook numerous day- and section-hikers. The obstacles were more challenging. The cloud cover moved back in and, with a strong breeze, brought the temperatures down to where I felt just about okay without a jacket. After the technical section ended, there was a long slog across an open, rocky stretch called The Tableland. Visibility was reduced to about 100 yards. I found it quite tedious. At one point I could see on a ridge above me what looked like the sign for the summit. But it was just an intermediate sign. There were several more false summits before it became clear that I was approaching the end of the AT, and at 10:45, I reached Katahdin's Baxter Peak, the northern terminus of the AT. There was a small group of people there already. I got my turn to have my photograph taken with the summit sign and climbed the steps at the back (""Oh, that's how you do it!"" said one person). While still standing on the sign, I stripped off my stained, discolored, slightly torn sun-shirt that I'd worn all the way from Marion, in Virginia, and put on the clean, brightly-colored  jersey that Aidan had brought me from my closet at home. I didn't feel exceptionally emotional. But when a couple asked me why I had done the trail, I started to choke up and couldn't talk. Lots more people began arriving and lo and behold! the clouds dissipated and the sun bathed us. The views below us were amongst the best on the trail, filled with lakes and craggy peaks. I had put on my rain jacket for a little warmth, and decided to get a few photographs of me with the sign in sunshine. Coins and Sugar showed up. In all I spent over an hour at the top before starting back down. It was just as tough, and sometimes tougher, going down as going up. I traveled most of the distance with Quick Start, a section hiker. He works for a hospital as a repairer of patient care devices. Having each other for company made the return trip fly by. We passed Zebra, and Butterfeet and his family, coming up. Back at the ranger station, Quick Start and I said our goodbyes, bumped fists, and wished each other a good rest of our lives. I made my way back to The Birches, where Aidan was still in his sleeping bag in the tent. With just over an hour before Phil Pepin would be showing up to take us to Bangor, ME, we had to hustle to get the tent stowed and gear packed. In fact, Phil did appear, a bit early, before we were quite ready. We stowed our stuff in the back of his truck, as did Coins, who was also traveling to Bangor, and hit the road. I don't know what time it was. It's time I was heading home. I've been gone a long time.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582017,"I'm sitting in an armchair in a friend's house near the ski resort of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. It's been snowing all morning and the skiing is probably wonderful now. But I'm not skiing. I have my right leg propped on a stool in front of me, as I rest an injury to my MCL (mediate collateral ligament) sustained a few days ago on my first day of skiing since March 2016. So I have lots of time to look back on my AT thru-hike and reflect on it and what has happened since I finished on Katahdin on July 28, 2017.
In retrospect, I suspect I was hiking on borrowed time for about the last month of the hike. After three and a half months, I had lost 40 pounds. I was still carrying a backpack that was too heavy, but at least my body was no longer being assailed daily by chafing straps and waist belts, as the good folks at REI in Richmond, VA had set me right with a slightly heavier but more comfortable pack. However, I had begun falling constantly, a sign of possible deep-seated fatigue. On one day in Maine I fell 19 times. I remember in particular the frustration and misery I felt as I descended Mt. Moosilauke in wet conditions, falling three or four times, including one fall in which I broke a trekking pole, followed by another horrible day during which I ascended North Kinsman. So, although I was still able to do 20-mile days once I hit Maine, it is debatable for how much longer I could have kept that going.
I arrived home on July 30. My family and friends made a fuss of me, deluged me with questions, and fed me. (Actually, let me change that – I stuffed my face at every available opportunity.) I quickly gained back every one of those lost pounds. But I found that I had no energy. I'd looked forward to getting back on my bike in preparation for the 192-mile charity ride I do each year in early August, but I was only able to drag myself out on the road one time, and felt wretched on that ride. I headed back to Boston for the event (the Pan-Mass Challenge). I rode it all, but for the first time ever, was not able to keep up with my team, who kindly waited for me at water stops and feed zones. That was a novel and humbling situation for me.
I spent a few weeks with my wife before I headed off to Ireland to see my mum for a week. Then my wife joined me for another week in Italy, before I drove up to the Italian Alps with my bike to ride with some relatives and friends on some of the steepest slopes in that region, including a long side trip one day by car to reach and ride the infamous Stelvio. Despite my continuing tiredness, I was able to make it up the climbs, but not as quickly as my younger brother and brother-in-law. On the downhills, I am still king!!!
To complete my adventurous 2017, in late October I flew down to Lima, capital of Peru, with my daughter. Starting there, we spent 6 weeks traveling by bus, Toyota Land Cruiser and plane through Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. It was only after two or three weeks at altitude in Peru that I noticed that the fog of exhaustion had lifted and I felt energised again. Perhaps it was the thin air forcing my body to respond by creating more red blood cells which helped heal me. Maybe it was just a function of time. We hiked some arduous trails in Peru, topping out at altitudes of around 15,000 feet, where on the upward stretches we would hike for two minutes, and rest for three to let our lungs and legs absorb the effort. I saw that I was able to keep up with the guides when others failed. (The AT did not purge me of my competitive instincts... sorry...) Today, over five months since I summited on Katahdin, I still have plantar fasciitis in both feet, and some toes on each foot that remain numb because of the nerve damage accumulated from 5 million steps.
Here are some questions people ask me about the AT:
Did you enjoy it?

Yes and no. By the last four weeks, I was dying to reach Katahdin. There was no way I was going to quit, but I wanted to quit and only pride kept me going. The scenery was stupendous all through New Hampshire and for a lot of Maine, but all I wanted was to get through it. I'll never forget the fear and misery of my descent of Moosilauke in wet conditions, falling three or four times (breaking a pole in one fall), and feeling so sorry for myself. But I'll also not forget the joy I felt setting out from the Murray Shelter in New Jersey after a long evening spent with the owner, Jim Murray. I literally danced. I’m happy now that I did the AT. I saw scenery only hikers see. I met some beautiful people. I made friends. So like the rest of life generally, the AT was a mix of good and bad, joy and pain. Some parts I enjoyed, some I didn’t. And for the rest of my life, I have bragging rights!

Would you do it again?

Probably not in its entirety. I am making some vague plans to hike certain sections again, maybe even with my wife, although she finds the thought of camping a bit off-putting. Just this morning I finished reading Cheryl Strayed’s book Wild about her time on the Pacific Crest Trail, and I have to admit that I felt some stirrings of interest in that. I’ve agreed with my son that we should hike some of the hills in Ireland like the Twelve Bens, but these are weekend hikes and no big diversion from ordinary life. Taking several months or even weeks away from my wife again would be a difficult thing, and unfair.

What surprised you most about the trail?

I’d done a lot of reading about the AT in advance, including following many of the Class of 2016 on trailjournals.com, and had spoken at length to former AT hikers. So I found very few surprises on the trail. A few of the minor surprises were: (1) how quickly injuries healed; (2) how rocky the trail is; and (3) how cool it was.

(1) Injuries: I frequently went to sleep with chronically sore knees or feet, certain that my hike was over. I would emerge from my tent in the morning with no pain. I have a theory, based on some material I read about people on starvation diets whose injuries healed more rapidly than expected. I think this healing-under-stress is an evolutionary development. Imagine two humanoids on the dusty African savannah a million years ago, both very hungry, and with identical serious injuries. One heals quickly, although that means her body must draw on depleted stores of body fat, potentially bringing her closer to death. The other heals more slowly, meaning his reserves last longer. However, when a gazelle goes by, the healed one is able head off in pursuit, chase down and kill that gazelle, and survive, passing on her genes and her quick-healing abilities to her descendants. The unhealed one lingers and dies. I think that since all thru-hikers are more or less in a continuous state of starvation, our bodies go into ‘hyper-repair’ mode, fixing us up quickly. If we were not starving, our bodies would feel safer in conserving reserves and letting us heal more slowly.

(2) Rocks: I knew in advance that certain sections of the trail were going to be rocky. But I was surprised at how rocky the trail became, particularly from Pennsylvania on, and for how long that rockiness persisted. It would be interesting, if it were possible to compile the statistics, to see how much of the trail’s surface would be classed as ‘even’, ‘moderately rocky’, and ‘rocky / technical’. As an aside, I think the oft-quoted statistic that the last 20% of a NOBO’s hike contains 80% of the effort is a big exaggeration. We forget the difficulties in Pennsylvania, parts of Virginia, and even back in Georgia and Tennessee – remember the ascent of Mt. Albert, or the descent from Dragon’s Tooth, to name just two?

(3) Temperatures: I expected that by the time late April or early May came around, I’d be dying in the heat, sleeping on top of my sleeping bag, and having to carry massive quantities of water. I sweat a lot – thanks for that segment of your gene code, Dad. Many years ago, when I was a runner, I would lose a pound per mile In Bermuda’s hot and humid summers. But with the frequently wet and overcast days on the trail in 2017, and the cooling effect of being at altitude, or hiking into the wind, or shaded by the green tunnel, I found the temperatures far more tolerable than I had anticipated.
Did the trail change you in any way?

Sadly, I don’t think so. Unlike many of my fellow-hikers who had come to the trail to ‘find themselves’, I hadn’t. Most of them were 18-22 years old, and they had questions to ponder and decisions to make – to go to college or not, to change jobs, to leave home. Others, usually older, had gone through or were dealing with life crises – addiction, divorce, the impact of tours of duty in Iraq or Afghanistan, the loss of a loved one. Luckily, I had suffered little in my life, and was not out on the trail to recover from a loss. The most I could claim was that I was on the trail to shed the stress of a job that had become unbearable. But most if not all of that stress had already fallen off my shoulders the day I left my job, two months before I headed for Georgia; my heart ceased to worry me with its little arrhythmic dances, and I began to enjoy untroubled sleep. I went on the trail partly just to see if I could do it, relishing the choice of an activity for which I was totally unprepared both physically and in terms of skill-set. I had never hiked before, and had never camped, apart from a few nights in Ireland 31 years ago, when I did a 700-mile bike tour. (People ask me why I didn’t do a few shake-down hikes before tackling one of the toughest hikes in the world. I really have no answer, except that I was limited in my ability to do so in Bermuda, and if I’d done so in the US, Uncle Sam’s IRS troops would have expected me to file a tax return there for 2017, since I’d have exceeded my permitted number of days.) So I was pleased that, despite suffering with sore knees, with backpack-induced aches and pains, and with cuts, scrapes and bruises from all my falls, I managed to complete the AT. But changed? I don’t think so. I love the sound of my own voice, as my family and friends will only too readily agree, and I’m still a chatterbox. I’m good company, and I think my trail colleagues would confirm that the trail didn’t change that. I put up with mild adversity reasonably well, and that was a good quality to bring on the trail, but I don’t think I’m any tougher. I’m still me.

Time to finish.

Here’s to all of you, those who helped me out along the way, those who cheered me on, those whose friendship supported me. As we say in Ireland: May the road rise to meet you, and may the wind be ever at your back.

,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582842,"Yesterday morning, the 9th of February, I was in Boston’s Logan Airport, taking the first leg of a three-leg trip that delivered me by late afternoon to the town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I spent a night last year in Gatlinburg during my hike of the AT. With its bright lights, cheesy roadside attractions, and crowded sidewalks, it reminded me of a mixture of Coney Island and Las Vegas, minus the super-fancy hotels and casinos. Dolly Parton comes from nearby, which kind of says it all. If you’d asked me then how soon I’d be coming back to Gatlinburg I’d have looked at you in puzzlement.
So what has me checking into the River Terrace Resort and Conference Center, just a block away from Gatlinburg’s Main Street? The folded-up trekking poles in my hand, and the very small backpack that constitutes my only luggage, might be a clue.
Last year I left Mt. Springer in Georgia on March 13th, and summited Katahdin on July 28th. I was thrilled to have completed the AT. I filed my 2,000-miler application with the ATC, and duly got my patches and certificate. But I had to keep on suppressing the memory of one minor defect in my thru-hike. When I hiked away from Newfound Gap, the nearest AT trailhead to Gatlinburg, I had come, four miles later, to what some claim is the prettiest viewing point on the whole AT - Charlie’s Bunion. Now here’s the thing: to get to Charlie’s Bunion, you have to hang a left off the AT (if you’re going north) and the view is a very short walk away. That side trail continues past the viewing point and rejoins the AT, BUT: it rejoins the AT at a different and more northerly point than where you left the AT. So you miss that little ‘Charlie’s Bunion Bypass’ section of the AT. This is what happened to me, and it has bugged me ever since. I come from a long and wide line of people in our family who do OCD* stuff like arranging our spices in the pantry in alphabetical order, or putting name labels on our device chargers. So you can understand why my long-suffering wife made not even a mild show of protest when I announced that I was going to fly back to Tennessee before my AT year would be up (on March 12, 2018) to fill in this little gap in my thru-hike; she knows me.
Curtis, the owner of Smoky Mountain Taxi, was waiting for me in his van when I checked out of the hotel this morning at just before 7. It was still somewhat dark (sunrise was 7:27), partly also because of the clouds. I had heard the rain begin as forecast at around 3:30am, a depressing sound when you are about to hike. Curtis’s wife, Heidi, was riding up front with him, which she usually does on Saturdays. Curtis has thru-hiked the AT six times and intends to do it one more time, although it’s been over 20 years since he completed his last one; he’s 61 years old and looks like he weighs 300 pounds and freely admits he will need to get in shape before he attempts it again. He owns a wide and bewildering array of businesses - taxis, international marketing, private planes, and a company that has nine helicopters - Curtis is a pilot and a former Marine (“I was in the Corps”). He’s also a Federal magistrate, licensed to carry a gun in State parks. He headed up the Internal Affairs division of the US Supreme Court and is a five-year survivor of pancreatic cancer. He’s a non-denominational pastor (so that he can conduct marriage ceremonies for homeless people who would otherwise, he says, be turned away by regular churches) who runs a foundation for the rehabilitation of alcoholics and drug addicts... well, you get the picture - an interesting man. The 33-mile drive up the long, winding road from Gatlinburg to Newfound Gap passed quickly. I was a bit dismayed to see drifts of snow begin to appear along the road and in the woods, and wondered how the trail would be.
At Newfound Gap, I said goodbye for the moment to Curtis and Heidi, after arranging for them to return for me in four hours’ time. I had a four-mile hike ahead of me to reach the fork in the trail for Charlie’s Bunion. It was still dark. I was wearing two layers of long-sleeved clothing under my Arc’teryx rain jacket. I was wearing shorts, and my current pair of Solomon Ultra-X boots (the ones my son Aidan had failed to bring with him for me when he joined me at Monson in Maine for the 100-Mile Wilderness, but I’ve gotten over that now, and I’m all into forgiveness and moving on, so I won’t say any more about it). I had forgotten to bring my backpack cover with me, but at the hotel I had improvised one from the trash bin bag in my room with judicious use of the duct tape still wrapped around my poles, so I put that on my beautifully light pack, although it wasn’t raining. It wasn’t cold either - somewhere around 50F. I started off on the trail with determination and great big strides. Within one hundred yards I was turning around and retracing my steps, as I’d taken a trail that led only to some restrooms. Oops. But nobody was watching.
According to Guthook, Newfound Gap is mile 207.3 on the trail and is at an elevation of 4,996. There’s a big parking lot for the tourists who flock up here to admire the views. The trail heads north from there through the forests, weaving back and forth across the Tennessee-North Carolina border, so you never know which state you are in. My start time on the actual trail was 7:27. The ground was wet and muddy. Almost immediately there was a section of log stairs. Then rocks. It felt like coming home, but more like coming back to one of those homes you ran away from, where you’d been physically abused. Then the patches of snow and ice on each side of the trail began to get bigger and to encroach on the trail. Soon they were covering the entire trail. The ice in the center of the trail was treacherous. I had no cleats on my boots. But at least I had poles. On the edges of the trail the ice was covered by a layer of snow. There were deep boot-prints in both the ice and the snow. Those in the ice were frozen solid, sometimes filled with what looked convincingly like clear water but was still ice. The only way to travel in control was to take short steps in the snowy verges and to always have a pole planted. I began to worry that my plan of doing the eight-mile round trip in four hours was unrealistic. At times the entire trail was covered with a sloping sheet of ice where a stream had overflowed and frozen, and I would search for the barest nubbins of rocks or a sliver of tree-root protruding from the ice on which to plant a boot. In such circumstances, planting a pole was impossible, sometimes even dangerous, as to get it to bite meant jabbing down with force, which would often lead to the pole’s tip skidding away across the ice, causing me to wobble a bit myself. I was not happy. But generally there was that snowy margin, so I made progress.
At the first waypoint, where a side trail branched off (Sweat Heifer Creek Trail - where did that name come from?), I did a quick check - 1.7 miles in 57 minutes. Not good, but I had climbed nearly 1,000 feet. I took off my rain jacket and one layer, as I was sweating profusely. Here’s where that 210 pounds hurts. To think that by June last year the trail had stripped me down to a gaunt 160... I soldiered on. In an unguarded moment, I slid on some ice and fell, landing on my left side. Well, it wouldn’t be me on the AT without falling, now would it? I had hurt nothing and just muddied up my knee.
The rest of the way to the summit was surprisingly a lot less hazardous and I made good time. Because of the fog that had started swirling about, there was no view, so the crest at 6,100 feet just under a mile further on was unremarkable. Shortly after that came the junction for Boulevard Trail. 2.7 miles done. The rain had begun to fall and I put my rain jacket back on. At mile 210.4 on the trail I reached the turn-off for Icewater Shelter. As the shelter was visible only fifty yards from the trail, I took the time to visit it. The smell of burnt wood was strong in the vicinity. A tent was set up in front of the shelter but there was no sign of life. (Curtis told me later that it was probably a volunteer ridge runner who loves that section of the trail and holes up there a lot in the winter.) I had thought of signing the register but the shelter was tarped up and in the interests of time I left quietly and kept going.
And so it was, about 0.9 miles later, at 9:25 in the morning, that I saw the sign for Charlie’s Bunion. I stayed on the AT and began counting my steps. One, two, three... The trail led downwards. At step 173, and at 9:27 am, I reached the northern turn-off for Charlie’s Bunion. My 2017 AT thru-hike was complete. I gave a solitary whoop to signal the momentous event, but unlike at Katahdin there were no spectators to clap and cheer and tell me how amazing I was.  Oh well.
Now all I had to do was get back to Newfound Gap in one piece, and in two hours. I decided not to return via the side trail to Charlie’s Bunion, as that would be the very worst place to twist an ankle or break a leg. All went well on the return until I once again had to deal with the long icy section that led down from the summit to the Gap. The rain by this time had washed off a lot of the snow layer covering the ice at the edges of the trail, depriving me of a relatively safe source of traction and forcing me to rely on those tiny outcroppings of rock or roots even more. I was more tired than on the ascent, and slipped and fell for the second time, but again without doing damage. However, at the start of one ice sheet, as I was simply standing there, wondering how I could navigate through it, I started to slide on both feet and accelerated right off the edge of the trail into the trees. I landed heavily on my left side. Straight away I noticed a pain in my ribs on that side that made breathing a little painful. I hauled myself up the steep slope back onto the trail below the ice sheet. Fortunately, this was to be my last fall. I had two or three incidents of finding my feet starting to slide which made me jerk my body in different directions to compensate - always successfully - and those antics caused me to gasp in pain from my ribs. But I was still able to use my poles without causing myself any pain, although I noticed that the straps were already beginning to produce those old familiar blisters on my hands that had plagued me in Georgia last year.
In the middle of the descent I met a young couple with large backpacks coming towards me who were sensibly equipped with cleats. They told me they were thru-hiking. I was thrilled to meet them, as I’d bought several Snickers bars to pass out if I happened to meet any thru-hikers. I gave them two each, and then enquired when they’d started from Springer. They looked confused, and I established that they were, in fact, merely day-hikers. I asked for the Snickers bars back.
Despite the awful descent over the ice, I had still made good time overall on the return leg. I was so happy to leave the snow and ice behind in the last few hundred yards and only have to deal with rocks, water and mud. I had told Curtis to come back for me at 11:30, and I emerged from the woods into the car park at Newfound Gap at...11:30 precisely. In the warmth of the van, my thighs began to warm up and itch like crazy. I changed into a dry sweatshirt and began to relax. A few hours later, I was checking into the La Quinta at Knoxville airport, and running a big hot bath for myself. I’m a happy camper.
