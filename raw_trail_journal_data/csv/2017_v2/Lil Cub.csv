Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/452904,"Destination Cold Creek Shelter4.8 miles. I woke up this morning with some bad news. My hiking partner ""Wave"", had a family emergency so he had to leave the trail this morning. It is a sad day for me but while being sad, I too am happy that we both got to hike some together. I thought about Wave all day while hiking. I was hoping that Wave would be able to rejoin me at some time in the future. But if not. It's ok. I hope and wish him success and I am thankful I got to know him. He talked about his family , his friends Erny and Joe and others as well as his daughters and ex wives. I really miss him. But my hike goes on and I am making good miles now. It's AWESOME !!!I left Cold Springs Shelter early after Wave set out to return home. I arrived at Cold Springs Shelter fairly early. There was one female hiker there already, Clamity Jane. S great older lady who is hiking to loose weight and she doesn't even like hiking. I slept in the shelter because it was supposed to rain. Other local hikers arrived along with Tom, an older thru hiker who's son is ahead of him by about 2 days. It rained some during the night but I was dry in the shelter. I didn't sleep well. Seems that I may switch from a tent to a hammock. From what I hear it's much better on the back. So any donations would be helpful. This is the last water source for the next 7 miles so I will fill up all containers in the am.","Cold Springs Shelter

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/337128,"I plan to hike in 2012. This journal is now being created to assist me in making the arrangements,document while learning in detail about what to expect and therefore be prepared as best I can. I want to find a good thruhiker journal for a NOBO hike in 2011 to follow. That way I can have a different perspective about the journey. David Millers AWOL on the Applichian Trail, id definately a fast track, with many physical challenges. I tend to want to follow a well prepared hiker who isn't going to fast track, and see the trail from a more relaxed perspective. Everything in me is about hiking the AT. I sleep, work, eat and shower, thinking about the hike. This journal will begin with a brief introduction about who I am and my quest to hike the AT. I hope I am able to find a serious individual who is planning to hike in 2012 as well that possibly could be my counterpart. So far many have said yeah I will go with you but way to often, saying and wanting to are two different things. I am as close as I have ever been in a serious departure in April of 2012 to fullfill a 9 year plus planing endevor, to thruhike ""The Applichian Trail"".",,"Mt. Kataden, ME","Feb 20, Sun",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/337173,"Today I am refelecting on my pre-hike planning. It all began back in 2003. This entry refelects back to that point, giving some background about my hike planning. The story begins on Saturday, January 15, 2003 at 3:05pm: I arrived at work that day and the weather is cool in the shade. I wanted to start this journal with some thoughts, ideas and plans about my hike which I had initially planned to start in mid March of 2006. This is more than enough time to plan such a hike of the AT. I actually began planning this adventure while taking a year off from my nursing carier. During the first three months of my break, I began to search the internet for some local trails and camping sites, many of them I had known about since high school, and wanted to refresh my spirit. I had been away for many years after I graduated, so now was a time to get reaquainred with my old stomping grounds. I discovered the AT and have become obsessedly determined to complete a thru hike of the AT begining at Springer Mt;GA to Mt Kataden in Maine. At that time, I had been working a part time job driving a cab to put money aside for this trip. There have beem multiple setbacks since my original planning began. Christmas in 2002, was difficult and overspending depeleted my funds and my chevy truck, a Silverado needs a transmission. I had planned to sell the truck and use the funds to assist with the finances for the trip. I wanted to have no less than 8K saved for the trip. I continue to sock away until I am finally able to have enough funds to keep the household afloat and not have to worry about home until I return from the trip.I plan to take no less tha 6 to 7 months to complete the hike. I want to enjoy this once in a lifetime experience. At that time I had $400 saved and had hoped to sell the chevy soon. I had planned to make daily enteries into my journal while on the trail. I also had planned to enter notes about my planning as as time progresses, updateing plans, schedules and goals. Good Luck To Me...Thanks be to God for all his wonderful blessings. I thought that I needed to put away $400 per month from Jan 03 to Feb 06 for this trip, along with the proceeds from the sale of my truck, I would have approx 8K, and equipment and supplies still needed to be purchased as well. MONDAY MARCH 21, 2005- wow a little over 2 years since my last entry in my hand written journal. I had purchased an Ospry 75 pack.(I have found this pack to be very good, lightweight and functional. At that time I was also so excited about aquiring the remainder of the equipment I would need for this hike. It seems that my hike might be delayed. I have had an offer to purchase a small business, and I was then in the planning of opening it up. I had to use some of my reserve hike funds to assist me with the opening of this new business. I still have to get the truck repaired at that time and my roommate wasn't paying his bills, and a great portion of the funds were stollen from the safe. I feared at that time that I may have to postpone my hike for another two years,(2007). Little did I know it was going to be another 5 years before I could seriously plan to take the time off for this hike. However now, during this time I was able to begin to rebuild my relationship with my daughter and son. My next journal entry would be 6 years later; here is a recap.WENSDAY JANUARY 26, 2011 4:45PM: nOW ITS BEEN 8 YEARS IN THE PLANNING. IT WAS AT LEAST 5 YEARS AND 9 MONTHS SINCE MY LAST JOURNAL ENTRY. I have been running my busness (Crestview Taxi LLC) for the past 5 years. With the economy on a down slide, the BP spill, and a weakened economic outlook, we just arn't making any money. I need new cabs, and need to update some much needed equipment in the cabs. Much blood, sweat and tears have been shed into making this company grow and be a success. This business like many others seems to be declining, and may eventually meet the demise like so man others have. There is one thing that hasn't been taken away yet and that is the desire to do a thru hike of the AT. Now if the monies from BP come in, as they should, for the Business as well as for personal, I am going to close shop, send my secretary on a cruise, and I am going to the woods for a while. My next entry is a bit uplifting. It begins on Wednesday Jan 26 2012 second daily entry. I feel a renewed strength in planning my 2012 hike. But work has me stressed out, I will continue to go forward in planning my hike. If I don't get the funds from BP, I fear that my hike will permenately lost. I am now reading David Millers AWOL on the Applichian Trail, a great book full of information, but the hike is too fast track for me. I want to soak it all in as I hike, I want to take the time to do it right, and enjoy the full scope, including hardships, frustrations, and rewards.",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Mon",0

I wanted to get started early but the rain held me up , again.   Good thing I only had a short day. I arrived at Cable Gap early as I was able to hike downhill pretty quick, but not before making another short steep climb up about a half mile before heading back down again. I was very anxious to get going. I arrived at the shelter at about 4pm. There were only 2 other hikers there, ""Ducktape and John who doesn't have a trail name yet. . I had met them both in passing before. We all decided to stay in the shelter because there was more rain forecasted.

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442595,"Today is a great day. Windy, 48* and sunny. Low tonight 46*. Currently at Amicalola Falls State Park it is 36* with a high of 43* and a low tonight of 27*. Prec is 16% with wind NW at 22mph making it feel like it's 25*. It was snowing there earlier this morning. I am prepared...of course it will be a bit warmer on April 1. Today I will attend the funeral service for the late Sheriff Ray Wilson. He and his family have been life long friends. He was a great Sheriff and neighbor. He lived next door to me for many years. I pay tribute to him today for his great contribution to Okaloosa County residents. His father was also a former Sheriff of Okaloosa County and was murdered by some low life rednecks, who the sheriff kept breaking up their moonshine stills. Ray vowed as a child to someday become Sheriff and find who murdered his dad and bring them to justice. And he did. Continuing in planning my hike and getting everything in order. I now have my home rented out,(i still am there)so my household is taken care of. Jim, my best friend and confident will keep Biscuit, my 3yo Shih Tzu and Josie, the poodle who is 14 will remain here at home with my friends. I feel that Josie will be better kept at home due to her age and special needs. She is a very needy dog and loves the attention. I think the trauma of moving her out of the home to a strange place with me gone, would crush her and she may die of depression. She is a very attached dog. I still haven't closed on the sale of my business yet. However, I do believe a final closing will be on Monday Feb. 17 (hopefully).My eye surgery is still scheduled for Feb 18, so I began using the eye meds today. Surgery on the L eye will possibly be postponed till after I finish my hike, since the L eye isn't bad yet. Thank goodness. I posted my proposed schedule leading up to my hike. It is subject to change but hopefully everything goes as planned. I am so excited, I hope all who read this journal as I proceed will feel the excitement and bring cheer and joy into your heart. Your support is appreciated as well. Enter a post as often as you wish, I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for visiting my journal, and please come back often.

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/443030,"I am so Grateful to the Lord for guiding me and allowing this Dream to come to life. Time is getting closer. I updated the Fellow Hiker List today. Its listed on 02/15/2014 entry. I don't always have time to post but keep checking back as you will and send me encouragement at you can. I probably will need it. I have read so many Journals, books and other material about the process of preparing for a hike. Each time I read about these events It excited me to no end. But, the excitement that is created when you are actually enter into an ""All Systems Go"" mode that the excitement really starts to kick in. I am sure as we approach the ""Count Down"" and then on to ""Full Throttle UP"", the excitement will be much greater. I just don't know if it really can get any better. The challenges of getting all the gear together and finalizing the details while staying in touch with friends is definitely time consuming and challenging. More challenges are coming. Am I ready? The answer is, Yes in some ways and no in others.     I am still getting my gear together. I went to Pensacola yesterday, and spent time with Jim. We had dinner at Millers Ale House. He had Chicken Parmesan while I had a Combo Seafood Platter filled with Fried Shrimp, Scallops, White Cod, Clams and Onion Rings served with Coleslaw. Awesome, After dinner we went to Shoe Station where I purchased a new pair of Crocks. Jim also bought a pair of shoes for his work. The next morning, Jim treated me to breakfast at Golden Corral. Jim ate 2 big plates, LOL and I ate probably equally. It was Raining all night last night and this morning as well. Thunder and heavy downpours at times. We made our way to Academy Sporting store in Pensacola, and it was huge. I picked up a few items including a coleman camp towel, a 5 ltr dry sac, 2 canister of MSR ISOPRO canisters, a Magellan Mummy Sleeping Bag Liner, an Adventure Medical Kit.5 and it is in a water proof sac, 1 liter Academy Bottle, Tear-Aid patch kit, a few protein bars and a couple of GU Energy gel packs, a Bison Designs Coreless Survival Bracelet (Light Duty Cord) and a Bison Para-Cord Necklace (9ft of 550 Para Cord). I will update my gear list and Fellow Hikers List (see entry....) when time permits. So stay tuned for more excitement. Thanks to Jim for being so supportive and contributing to the expense for equipment. Thank all my Family and friends who continue in my enthusiasm and support me. Your encouragements have helped me so much. Its now 5:07pm and I have been looking at all my gear I have and thinking that I can't wait till the rest of my stuff gets here. I ordered a Bear bag, sleeping bag, sleeping mat, gaiters, tent and footprint, convertible pants, sun/rain hat, and a coffee/drink mug by MSR. It's about to count down now and I have come a long way and a shorter time to go now.",,Sunday February 23,"Feb 23, Sun",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/443365,"Today I received my order from ZPacks which included my Bear Bag kit and a Medium Cuben Fiber Dry Bag. I intended to use the Dry Bag for my sleeping bag but instead wound up using it as a clothing bag. It was just too small for the Down Sleeping Bag that I purchased. So anyway all the planning, and getting the gear together I finally am to the point of packing it all up and see where I am weight wise. I am trying to keep a pack weight (less food and water) to a minimum at around 25lb. After going through each of the 4 individual bags of food (one for each day for a 4 day supply), I was able to trim the weight considerably. However a hiker a hiker requires approximately 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) of food per day. 
My Bear Bag Kit w/ Roll Top Food Bag with carabiner (used when hanging), 50ft 2.2mm cord and rock sack seems awesome. It’s supposed to be rodent resistant, and hopefully it will live up to its claim. After packing up 4 days of food, the bag was full, but not so much as to prevent me from adding a little more. It weighed out at 9 lbs, giving me a little extra room for play. So if I need 4.4lbs of food per day this is actually going to give me only enough food for a little over 2 days. Seems that 4lbs per day is quite high. I wonder if the dehydrated foods I have will actually weigh up to an additional 2lbs when the water is added. I am planning on breakfast, lunch and dinner for 4 days, plus snacks. Oh
I know I can add a jar of peanut butter and some bread LOL, maybe some other things. Where are those jelly packets, did I forget them? Oh I must get some. 
My Brother Ken came by this morning for a short visit. I was able to chat about the hike some, and give him a pre-addressed drop box that he can send to me along the trail at some established place. I am thankful that he will do this. I am sure the treats will be like Christmas all over. Also I was interesting to learn that Ken and my Nephew Brandon will be racing their Go Carts in Pensacola next weekend. My Prayer is that they finish early and safely. 
My attorney also came by today for a brief meeting. All is good and we are on track. I still have some tax work to finish up by this weekend. Then I can devote the rest of my time finishing up the last details, and finish packing up my pack. I still need a camera. Ugh….I am trying to be conservative as much as possible now. I have all the equipment I need now. I have spent a lot of money replacing and updating my gear, but I think it will pay off in the end. After all, I am going to do this long planned dream in which I give thanks to God for all his blessings that is now allowing me to live the dream. 
I am so excited….I can’t wait till it’s actually departure day to Atlanta Airport where I will catch the Marta to the North Springs Station, where I will catch the shuttle to the Hiker Hostel for 2 days before being shuttled from the Hostel to Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge, where I will stay one night and then hike the approach trail to The Hike Inn where I will stay one night. The next morning I will set out to complete the approach trail up to Springer Mt. and officially begin my Journey. 
Everything is coming together and much progress has been made. There is still a lot to do before I head out. You can read all about planning and the excitement that builds up in you when reading, just isn't the same as it is when you’re actually experiencing it. It’s getting closer day by day.

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/443505,"I just returned from Jims place in Pensacola. I drove over yesterday afternoon and we went to dinner at Texas Road House. It was probably the best service I have had anywhere in a few years. Even though we had to wait about 40 min to be seated, we were seated at a small table and promptly served our beverages. Jim had Raspberry Ice Tea and I had regular Ice Tea. Hot buttered Rolls were served immediately. Oh they were so tasty and piping HOT!    The place was filled with excitement and all servers had smiles on their faces and wore shirts that had lettering on the back that read, “I love my Job.” I thought to myself, how many people really do like their job. This crew was exceptional and it showed. Soon after a bit, our server Alecia introduced herself and ask if we would like to start with an appetizer, we selected the Onion Blossom.   Alecia, recognizing that Jim was deaf, thought she might need some assistance taking our order, returned with another server named Kaley who understood sign language and was able to perform it very well. We learned that she actually was going to be attending Troy State University to complete her courses to become an Interpreter. The appetizer was served right on time, and we had a chance to enjoy it before the side salad I ordered with my meal was served. After the side salad our main course was served within a just a couple of minutes. There isn’t anything I hate more when dining out is to be rushed and you just get your appetizer served practically when the main dish is served.   Over the food was delish, the service was impeccable, and the experience was wonderful. I might add that after our meal, a young man came to our table and introduced himself. I explained to him the pleasant experience we had. I ask him who he was and he told us that he was one of the floor managers. I wish I had gotten his name down. Everyone seemed interested in hearing some of what we could share about my upcoming hike.So, before going to dinner I wanted to go to Dicks Sporting goods and outfitter store to pick up some Insect repellant that I hadn’t remembered to purchase. While I was there I also picked up a camp sewing kit, and a moleskin Blister Medic kit for those blisters that may soon to be coming. And I couldn’t resist picking up a couple of protein bars as well. I am sure I will find the room in my food bag somewhere. March 1, was the Official beginning of the Count Down. 27 days and counting…till I head to Georgia. A couple of days ago I received a message from an old friend Barbara.   Barbara and her husband Tony are both very good friends and former colleagues of mine from NEW. It just so happens that Barbara is planning to visit some friends up in GA around the time that I will be heading out. Barbara generously offered to give me a ride to Atlanta. So we are trying to work out the details so that we can spend some time together and see me off on April 1. That was such a generous offer and it will allow us both to save some money if it all works out. So far it seems very possible and I am so astonished and excited that things are working out better than I had planned. I was reading Backpacker magazine on line that I subscribe to and found an easy exercise routine to help me get in better shape for those steep climbs and uphill hiking that will soon be upon me. I plan to start those on Monday. I know I should have started about 6 weeks ago, but it is what it is.",,Count Down Begins,"Mar 02, Sun",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/443602,"Monday, March 3, 2014 12:01pmToday seems like eternity. I woke up this morning around 3am. Checking my phone for the time, I just couldn't believe my eyes. Anyway I have been awake since. No naps yet. I have a slight cold and have had a sore throat for several days, along with a headache, runny nose and some sneezing, fever, chills and well the overall flu symptoms. I have been taking over the counter meds which do help me to sleep. Anything over 6 hours for me it too much. But I am feeling a bit better today and none the less excited as the day I realized that this hike was going to actually happen this year. I am so thankful for all of my hiker friends who are giving much of themselves in prayers, blessings, donations, gifts and other things. I could not complete this hike without all of their well-wishing and encouragement. I also am encouraged by those who do not know me personally and have chosen to follow my Hiking Journal. So together, I do hope that a lot of enjoyment and excitement fills their soul as they read.Again last Saturday, I took one of my dogs, the Shih Tzu Biscuit to Jims for an overnight stay. I am taking her with me every weekend I visit so that Biscuit will become more secure at his place when he takes her for the next 6 months. Josie, the poodle who formerly belonged to my Grandmother and then to my Uncle will be staying here at home. I think the trauma of moving her to another home even temporary would be way too much for her. She is an old dog and at about 14 years old, has bad eye sight and very poor hearing. But then again I think she is like some humans I know, that utilities “selective hearing”. I had a little shopping to do at Dicks Sporting Goods Store where I bought some foot blister care and prevention, insect repellent, and a small sewing kit. And Of course I treated myself with a couple of protein bars and some freeze dried Neapolitan ice-cream. Never had any before so I am going to pack it in my food bag and enjoy it later. I have been conversing with my new hiker friend !SweetandSour, from Panama City who will doing a thru hike in 2016, and doing a section from Springer to Neil’s Gap in April of this year.   We have been discussing food and he was generous enough to share with me his food caloric intake of 3,000 calories per day. Some items he mentioned sure gave me food for thought. I am sure he and I will learn much from each other. It’s also encouraging for me to know that there are other aspiring hikers that live in and around my backyard so to speak. I still haven’t been able to make contact with the female from Pensacola who is doing a thru-hike this year as well. I am sure he will be posting on Trailjournals.com like myself, and I do plan to keep up with him as much as I can and time permits.Over the past few days I have been talking to Barb, an old friend and colleague from NEW. Her and her husband have been long friends since we worked there. Barb and Tony enjoy the outdoors as much as any of us do and they do visit the mountains as often as time permits. As it turns out, Barb will be leaving on the 31 to visit some peeps of hers up in Tennessee. Barb was so generous to invite me to ride with her and she would take me to Amicalola Falls State Park. With a little flexibility this is a very doable option for me, saving me about $200 +. So the plan is set now to leave on the morning of the 31 of March. I won’t need to catch the Marta train out of Atlanta Airport and I won’t need to stay at the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega, GA. or at the Lodge at the falls. This is GREAT. We are both going to camp at the campground at Amicalola Falls State Park, where the Southern terminus and approach trail for the AT are located. Barb will be camping up in her van while I get to sleep in my new tent for the first time. Then the next morning I am sure we will find breakfast at the Lodge, and then she will see me off before heading to her destination. We have been talking so much about this and I can’t think that any sendoff could be any better than this one. I am so happy that God has and is continuing to bless me as I continue my readiness. I pray that God also blesses all those who are assisting me and involved in any way shape or form, even the animals for sharing with me this Journey. God Bless the readers also.My Dear Mom and Dad are so supportive now as well. At first, even years ago when this hike was just becoming a thought and or a dream, everybody thought I was crazy. But now it’s a reality, and I thank God for all his Blessings, they always seem to come right on time and unexpected, but confident that he will lead the way. My Dad has been dehydrating some apples, bananas and who knows what else. I think he has got it down to a science. They are so tasty. I was visiting yesterday and he gave me some to share with my house sitters and their little girl, not to mention some for me to take along on my hike. Also, something that touched me so much was when my Dad told me that he had something that he wanted to give me. Well, knowing my Dad you never know what to expect. I remember now that one Christmas I was having my first Christmas decorating in my new home. Since I didn’t have much money, everyone was to bring a tree ornament to decorate the tree. My Dad brought the most meaningful, but simple ornament made of a good size pine cone painted up and a string attached for hanging. I kept that ornament for many years until it finally gave out. So well my Dad usually has a reason for everything. So when he returned to the room to give me the gift he mentioned, he had a newspaper that was slipped into one of the plastic bags that are sometimes used. He ask me if I had something to cover my wallet. And well, I just answered no. So he gave me the plastic bag and then told me a short sentence that made me almost break down in tears. My Dad said that when he was serving in Korea he kept his wallet wrapped up in a plastic sack and it kept it dry. Those of you who know the climate in Korea can certainly identify. So with that said I graciously took the sack and wrapped my wallet in it right there. And it still is to this day and will remain wrapped up in that ole sack he gave me for the Trail. It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. But I thank him for serving our great country, and now I still have the freedom to go hike it and enjoy what he helped to protect. Thanks Dad. I will carry this sack all the way and back. 27 Days and Counting",,Count Down Extendrd,"Mar 03, Mon",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/443983,"Friday March 7' 11:22pmI left home on Thursday  afternoon March 6, heading for Amicalola Falls State Park and Lodge to attend a 3 day event for the Appalachian Trail Kickoff 2014.  Numerous speakers and tips and other informative information that helps in planing and doing a thru hike. I didn't get to the Park until about 3am. Wow. What a trip. I got lost in Dahlonega and GPS was not working right. I found myself on a narrow, twisty' muddy,, bouldering back country mountain Rd. GPS said 7 miles to the park. But it was a dead end. So I had to wind myself back down off that mountain road. So after I got to the park' I climed in the back of the Explorer where I had set up a nice bed. Then I woke up at about 7am this morning. I registered at the kiosk and paid my 5 dollar a night fee. I then went up to the Lodge and had a great southern breakfast while looking out and down the mountain into the valley below. It was cool out and I could see the clouds or fog way down below. The lodge sits atop a mountain. After a long leisure  breakfast, I drove back down yo the park located at the base of the Falls. I then drove to the Hiker Hostle which I didn't realize was a 40 min drive. And again GPS failed. Took me some time. I decided that I didn't want to commute from there for the next 3 days, so I cancelled my reservations. After arriving back at the Falls I checked in with the Ranger and no tent sites were available at Tent city. So I enjoyed the facilities of the park until kick off at 7pm. I then drove back up to the Lodge for the first event which started at 7pm.Parking at the Lodge was ample. I still didn't have a camp site so I had planned to car camp again. While I was parking there was another car parking next to me. As it turns out, this guy also drove down the same mountain road as I did. We also discussed about going to the same carwash in Dahlonega that didn't work. Sure needed to wash the mud off of the Explorer. We became instant friends to hang out with since both of us were there by ourselves. His trail name is Gearedup and he hiked the PCT last year.  And doing the AT this year beginning on Monday March 10.  After the presentations ""geared up"" ask me if I would like to camp up at his site which was free by the way. So we drove up to the camp area which is rustic and not part of the paid camping area. We arrived after dark and after a bit of chit chat' Geared up"" camped in his car even though he had set up his one Man tent. I car camped in the back of the truck and bundled up in the blanket I brought along and a good pillow. I was all set. Until .....about 3 or 4 am woke up freezing. My feet were hurting so bad from cold. I tried everything. I finally wound up starting up the truck and get the best going on. I didn't rest well that night. Tomorrow will be a better day.",,ATKO Arrival Day,"Mar 07, Fri",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/444456,"Saturday March 8, 2014Woke up this morning feeling energized and anxious to get the day started. It was a cool crisp morning and the sun was coming up warming up very quickly. Gearhead and I decided to head down to the Lodge and have some great breakfast at the lodge. They have a great buffet there and I guess it’s better than Ryan’s, but then again most buffets are better than Ryan’s.   I had scrambled eggs, bacon, OJ, black coffee, grits, fried potatoes and a biscuit. Full and ready to get to one of the presentations featuring AWOL at 10am and Sir-Packs-A lot at 11am. Then at 1pm Gene Espy, Hall of Fame Charter Member and a 1951 thru-hiker; the second man to thru hike the AT; and author of “The Trail of My Life”…Georgia’s own Gene Espy.There were many other events such as Dehydrating Backpacking Food, ATC Reports “State of The Trail”, Trekking Abroad “The Sky’s the Limit! With Bill known as “Skywalker” This guy is 7’+ tall, I stood next to him at the Fireside Quest at 7pm. He is definitely a tall drink of water.During the day “Geared up” and I decided to do some hiking and exploring since some of the events were not of interest to us not to mention the fact it was so hot in the conference room, could hardly breathe. We hiked down from the Lodge to the base of the falls using the stairs. 460+ steps down, well now you got to remember ya got to get back up too, lol. After I finished exploring I hiked back up to the Lodge, going back up the steps again, and the steep trail leading up to the stairs from the base of the falls. Strenuous, yes but very enjoyable. I met several hikers again that were setting foot out that day. It’s all so exciting. I just cant wait till I actually start my hike. We attended the show room where you could purchase gear, books, and much more. I met AWOL, and had him autograph my copy of the 2014 Northbound book called “The AT Guide”, A Handbook for Hiking the Appalachian Trail written by David Miller, “AWOL”I was also able to get my passport stamped by several vendors and others. Back at camp that night, I decided to head back home early on Sunday. It’s warmer tonight and not so cold. Will be a good night. Well now where do I start, I ask myself. Well first thing this morning I was cold and didn't rest much. If I had broken out the down 15 sleeping bag and used it instead of a light fleece type blanket I would have been warm. Oh I am not complaining because I know that the AT is cold, wet, and hot. I realise that I am going to experience all this and more on the AT. Let's not forget the people we come in contact with, better known as the ""Trail Community"". Starting with all the Staff of many organizations including Family and friends, Appalachian Trail Conservancy, Amicalola Falls State Park and Lodge, Hiker Hostel, Trail Journals, White Blaze, gear supply and many more. But one of the best experiences I had today is meeting lots of hikers, their families, and learned some new things about the AT. I know my hiking buddy ""geared up"" is ramped up to do this hike. I am so blessed that all these people of the trail are some of the nicest, friendliest group of people I have ever met. 
This hike of mine and everyone else who completes this hike will come out a different person. Coming here to the ATKO has given me a whole new perspective of what I am about to experience. 
I am excited about the many hikers who are hiking this year. Some have already started, some started yesterday, some this morning, some tomorrow and of course my first hiker friend, ""gearedup"" will be starting up Monday. I am excited for all of them especially the ones who attended the 3 day event. 
It was awesome to meet AWOL, Skywalker, cupcake, and so many others. I enjoyed meeting so many hikers that seem like Family. Even the Family and friends and fellow hikers. The real story here is today we all made new friends here and in some cases will be seeing them on the trail. I met Grasshopper who is starting on the same day but going to start north of the Smokies to avoid the crowds. As for me I just want to start today like every other hiker who is starting this year. 
The Dream is coming to reality. I am so stoked up and seeing other hikers who are just as stoked is energy. 
I had breakfast and lunch at the Lodge restaurant and chicken salad from a can with crackers tonight. It was good. I hiked down and up the steps from the top of the falls, and the trail from the Lodge to the Visitors Center and back. 
Tonights big event at the bonfire, question and answer session. Plus the bonus of meeting a SOBO hiker who finished his hike today at Amicalola . There is so much energy here. I can't wait till I return here on the 31st. 
I am at camp and I am ready to sack out. Its been an exciting day. Its not as cold tonight so I don't think I will need the sleeping bag. 
Tomorrow is the last day and I will be heading home tomorrow night or Mon morning",,ATKO Second Day,"Mar 08, Sat",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/444460,"Wednesday March 12, 2014Well it’s now 18 days and counting. Yahooo……..At home now catching up on some journal notes and feeling rested.I left Amicalola Falls Sunday morning after another breakfast at the Lodge. While I was there Gene Espy, the second man to have thru hiked the AT in 1951 was there for the 3 Day ATKO event. As I was walking into the Lodge, Gene and his group were coming out the double doors and “Geared up” and I held the door open for them. Entering the Lobby, I said “ isn’t that the famous guy? Geared up replied yes he thought so.   Well I couldn’t stand it, I had to go back and introduce myself while they were all standing at the entrance. In doing so I had a great short conversation with this bright brilliant man and his assistants. They wanted me to take some pics of their group, and gladly I did. In return I got my pic taken with him. This was an awesome moment!!! As I was getting ready to head home, I was feeling sad that I was leaving such a beautiful place. But at the same time I felt excited and very anxious to return to get started on my hike. I was joyful. I had a leisure drive home and took a detour to East GA to see an old friend for a few hours. Then it was homeward bound. Got home late, and couldn’t sleep from all the excitement that I had on this trip. I was up all day no sleep. I got caught up cleaning up the truck from the old Mountain Rd. ( I am still curious what road that was) Got the truck unloaded, laundry done, and excited to go through my pack to lighten the load even more. I learned a lot from the ATKO event and I would recommend anyone who is planning a thru hike to attend, especially if you’re a newbe. Anyway I found that my truck had a problem. It was running hot so had to figure out the problem, which turned out to be a simple fix. Thermostat was sticking and a short metal pipe coming from the thermostat housing had sprung a leak. So spent Tuesday getting it repaired. I am catching up on making sure my house is in order before heading back to GA in a little more than two weeks. I am so pumped up and ready to go.",,Reflecting ,"Mar 12, Wed",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/444683,"Friday March 14, 201416 days and counting. I was up very late last night installing a new refrigerator. Thanks to my Brother Ken, who so graciously took me all the way to Destin to pick up the new fridge. He then stayed and helped to remove the old fridge and bring in the new one. Of course we had to remove the doors to get it into the house. LOL    My house sitters Steven and Tabatha helped so much in cleaning out the old one and getting the new one ready to move in. Steven was so helpful as he was helping out in-between working. I could not have done it as easily without all their help and I am so grateful. Woke up early this morning getting ready to head to Pensacola to see my friend Jim for the weekend. He is such an Angel that he is taking care of Biscuit (the shih tzu) while I am on my hike. I plan to go pick up a can of bear spray at one of the gear supply stores and probably a camera as well from Toys or Us, which has a clearance sale on a Go-Pro. I got word from “Mailman” that he is still planning on starting April 1 as well. I am waiting to hear back from him about his time schedule, hopefully getting to meet him before hitting the trail. I also heard from “Sweet and Sour” from Panama City who will be doing a section hike in late April, so I won’t be seeing them on the trail, but he offered some trail magic, YIPPIE YI Ahy along the way. Just gota let him know a mail drop addy. I find that with every turn in this planning experience is filled with unexpected kindness and offerings. I just am so thankful to God for sending the Angels my way. The hiking community is like none other than I have encountered. This experience is making me a better person and I am looking forward to giving back.I ran out of coffee, so I decided to pack up my laptop and head to the local Starbucks for coffee and to purchase coffee for home and pick up some additional individual instant coffee to pack up in my food bag. So here I am thinking that it is now just a few days away until my friend Barbara will be picking me up for that trip back to Amicalola Falls. I also learned that my bud “Gearhead” was late getting started. When he left the Park on Sunday to return his rental to Atlanta, his ride from the airport back to Amicalola left him, and it was prepaid too. Shame on Dave’s Shuttle, which didn’t want to refund him either. It’s a sunny brisk morning, and I am anxious to get over to Pensacola and I plan to go through my pack again this weekend to see what I can unload to make my pack lighter. LOL My Sister-in-Law, Nancy wants to have a little get together for a send-off before I depart to GA. I think this is a wonderful idea and it is unexpected, but I am looking forward to it.",,Daily entry,"Mar 14, Fri",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/445554,"Friday March 21, 2014 (5:22am)Woke up at 4am this morning and couldn’t go back to sleep. All I can do is think about going on this hike. My plans are still on track to head to Amicalola Falls on the 31 and set foot on April 1. I purchased a new camera for this trip and waiting for it to arrive. The GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition is the best video and snapshot camera available for an outdoor adventure. I can’t wait till it arrives and check out all the functions. Been looking for a steadicam curve, but haven’t been able to find one. I will be documenting this adventure in pen on this Journal as well as doing a video documentary. I had a wonderful breakfast with Barbara and her husband Tony last Wednesday at Cracker Barrel. I hadn’t seen Tony in a very long while. It was good to share some special time with both of them. I am very thankful for such wonderful Christian friends, who are excited for me and encourage me along during this prep time. After breakfast, I thanked them both for inviting me to breakfast and I left full as a tick and happy that I had the chance to see Tony before Barbara drives me to GA. I plan to go through my pack today to see what more I can do to lighten the load some. It’s not bad now, but I think I can shave off maybe a pound. LOLI read Geared-Up’s journal this morning and he seems to be a bit cold when he got to Neels Gap Shelter. He says no Bears or mice yet. HummmmAs a reminder I am doing this hike because it’s something I have always wanted to do after I discovered the AT. In addition I am also doing this hike to raise money for the CF (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation). My goal is to raise $2,000 in memory of my late Daughter Sissy. I now have raised $225, a long way from the goal, but I am sure I will make it. Seems like $2000 is fitting since when I finish this hike I will be considered a 2000 miler. Remember the AT is 2180 miles long. I am looking forward to having a family get together before I leave, what a great sendoff that will be. My Brother Ken helped me out so much last week when my refrigerator decided to crap out. I am so thankful that he waited 3 hours to take me to Destin, about 45 minute drive to the coast to pick up another from a military guy who had purchased new for his home. The one he sold me is just like the one I had and it works great at $250.   Ok I am going to see what I can get accomplished today…9 DAYS AND COUNTING

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/445696,"Saturday March 22, 2014 8:06amI woke up at 3am this morning and couldn't sleep for thinking about how close it is to departing Crestview with Barbara, who is driving me to Amicalola Falls and will see me off on April Fools Day. Hummm, funny as it may seem, there is no fooling here. I uploaded some more of my equipment this morning with photos. I also did a shakedown of my pack yesterday and was able to shave a pound or two. I now have all my equipment I need, just waiting for my camera to arrive today. My pack weight at this point is 25lb minus food and water. I don’t think that is too too bad but I may do a final shakedown again just to try an condense as much as possible. I called my Mom yesterday to see if she knew of someone who has a trash compactor that I might be able to acquire a bag from to line my pack with. Mom said she did have a friend who might be able to accommodate, so hopefully this will work out. I am in touch with Barb frequently on FB, and we both are so excited about our separate ventures. I am so blessed to have Barbara and Tony as close friends. I am ever so grateful for their support and encouragement, suggestions and ideas. They truly want to make sure I am prepared as much as possible. When checking my Journal this morning I saw where Tater tot 2012 had signed my Guest Book. I was a surprised that he was from Niceville, which is about a 15 minuet drive south and sits along the Bay. He and his bud set out to hike the trail last year after graduation. Tater tot 2012 unfortunately wasn’t able to complete the hike but his bud did. Tater tot 2012 had some great advice and I wanted to thank him for his thoughts and words of wisdom, and for following me along the way like many others. I do hope that each of you can relive through my pen, photos and video documentary my thru hike. May you all enjoy the Journey with me, and a big thanks to all who follow me and support me in this adventure of a lifetime. It’s now 8 days and counting.

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/445936,"Sunday March 23, 2014 6:18pmI just returned home from Jim’s place in Pensacola. I drove over yesterday after the mail ran at 2:30pm. I was waiting on my new camera to arrive before heading out of town. Finally the mail ran on time, and I loaded up Biscuit (the Shih Tzu), an overnight bag and my new camera a GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition, the latest model out by GoPro. I was all excited to check it out and become familiar with it. I headed out and decided to take Hwy 90 instead of the Interstate because I was stopping in Pace, about 30 miles West of my home to pick up a trash compactor bag from a sweet older couple that were friends with Barbara (the Trail Angel that is driving me to Amicalola. On the way I noticed that I heard a sound that didn’t seem right coming from under the hood, but all seemed to be going well. When I arrived at the couple’s home, John and Simonne in Pace, I was greeted with a friendly hello and was invited in. After a brief introduction and stating my reason for wanting a compactor bag, they got right into the subject of making sure I had all the equipment I needed. They were very interested in hearing about my planning. Simonne shared a short story about a late brother of hers that always wanted to hike the AT. He took a bus to Atlanta and had to walk some distance on the highway to get to his destination. During his highway walk, he developed serious blisters on his feet. Anyway when he finally got to the trail head he was turned down and told he couldn’t walk the trail. Simonne didn’t know why that happened. Anyway they were excited that I was sharing with them a bit of my planning and preparedness. Then they brought out not one, but three trash compactor bags one of which was like a brown sack lined with a plastic like substance. The other two were white plastic heavy duty bags. After our short visit, and exchange of contact information, I tried to pay them for the two plastic bags but they wouldn’t take a red cent. Talk about Trail Angels. These folks wanted to follow my Journal and wanted me to keep in touch eager to hear about the hiking journey. I then thanked them and headed back out to Pensacola which was then only about a 20 min drive. After getting back on US 90, I was so thirsty and decided to stop at Hardies drive through to get a soda. While I was about to pull away from the window I smelled something like rubber burning. I heard something flop under the hood and noticed that the temp gauge started to rise. So I just pulled forward into a parking space to check it out. What I found was that the idler pulley had seized up and caused the serpentine belt to break. Well, now here I was an hour from home in the middle of this small community with no tools. As it so happened, an older gentleman saw my hood up and he parked his old truck next to me. Turns out he offered to help me out, taking me to the auto parts to get the replacement belt and pulley, and he then put it on for me. I did compensate him for his trouble. As it was, he was just going to meet some of his fishing buddies at Hardies for coffee and to shoot the crap. Well after the repair was done I went inside and shot crap as well. So here it is, I haven’t even started my hike yet and I am already encountering Trail Angels. The Mechanics name was John as well, a bit of fouled mouth, but hey, I got back on the road. About a half hour later I arrived at my friend Jim’s home before dark. Famished, we decided to go to dinner at Sonny’s BBQ, actually got take out. Got back to his apartment and chowed down. I was anxious to break into my camera and see what it was all about, which I did. I couldn’t take any movies or pics because I didn’t have a microsd card. However I do have one ordered online and awaiting it to arrive. I read the complete owner’s manual and charged up the remote and camera. It’s ready to go. Continued…After reading all about the camera, I talked with Barbara about Trail Angels and Trail Names. Barbara is such an Angel. She is my first Trail Angel and she is so excited about learning what Trail Angels are all about. She has been reading journals, watching video documentaries of AT thru hikes. She wants so much to do this. She said to me to see the expressions on the faces of the hikers that received some trail magic just made her day. We also talked about trail names. She told me that her trail name is Mama Bear, and of course she is assisting me in making sure that I have all bases covered for my equipment and such. She really has taken a sincere interest in all of this and what a blessing it really is. She, “Mama Bear” calls me her Lil Cub. How perfect is this for a trail name. It’s so fitting. So here ya have it, my Trail Name is now officially “Lil Cub” instead of “Crestview_hiker”.    I went to sleep after a big portion of Boston cream pie that Jim had bought, yumm yummm. After I finish this journal entry, I am going to go get one from Publix. I awoke at 5am this morning and Jim and I had coffee and breakfast of hash browns, scrambled eggs and sausage links. Spent the rest of the day relaxing and chatting about the upcoming hike which now starts 8 days from now. Tomorrow morning, it will be 7 Days and Counting.

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/448545,"This morning wasn't any different than any other morning, waking up at 3am    What was different though was this day is departure day. I got up got showered and dressed. I began by checking my pack making sure I had everything in order. UPS was to deliver my Steadicam today also. So I have to wait to have it sent to me at Mountain Crossing. I was supposed to meet ""Mama Bear"" at my Mother and Dads at 5:30am. I didn't get there till about 8:30am, running late should be my middle name. After a short visit and goodbyes ""Mama Bear"" and I set out to Amicalola Falls State Park, where we would camp that night before I set out on the trail and Mama Bear would head up to Cade's Cove in Tenn. black bear country for sure. Mama Bear said that she had directions that her husband Tony had given her. We got lost somehow on the west side of Atlanta. I pulled up the GPS on my IPhone and of course it was telling us how to get there. We were still an hour behind. When we got to Amicalola it was about 5pm (I think). The Visitors Center was already closed for the day, so we drove on up the mountain to check the camp reservation at the Lodge. After getting our pass we drove on into the campground to pick out a campsite. Mama Bear says that she has always had good luck work #13. So campsite # 13 seemed like it was a perfect spot. After setting up camp we went back down to the Lodge for supper. After returning to camp, we walked to another campsite across from us where an older gentleman and his son were camped. They called themselves ""The Photos"". Photo, the son and Photoo the father. We learned during our conversation with them that the old mans Dr. had given him his death sentence so to speak, so the old man Photoo, was on his last hurrah. They told us that their business was taking photos and videos of weddings and other popular events. Now we started talking about pack weights, I couldn't believe it when they told me that their pack weight each was a whopping 100lbs. They both were carrying large camera equipment, laptop, huge tent and no telling what else. I believe they were going to attempt to hike to Springer to do photo shots. However , they were not physically fit to tackle the challenge. They had tried to go up the approach beginning with the stairs, (604) steps straight up to the Top of the Falls. They eventually had to abort and they wee waiting on a ride to come pick them up to go back home. We exchanged contact information and as I finished writing their information , the pen gave out of ink. Now mind you that ""Mama Bear and I were in campsite 13. On the pen was written Brackney Funeral Home, and Photoo had been given a death sentence- humm... Odd but true. I climed inside my tent and fell fast asleep. Sent from my iPhone","Crestview Fl

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/448547,"I woke up at daybreak and began to pack up my gear and break camp, head down to the lodge for breakfast. Mama Bear and I were greeted by the Lodge desk clerk and offered coffee. I gladly accepted. We had to wait for the restaurant to open at 7am. 15 min later we were able to get in. Mama. Bear found us a table where I could plug in my electronics to top them off. After breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon biscuit grits, and fresh fruit , we went back up to camp to finish packing up. I had decided to save mama bear and me some time I would do a full hike of the approach.   We then drove down the mountain back to the Visitors Center where I would register as a thru hiker of the AT and set foot out on the approach from the archway directly behind the Visitors Center. I met several hikers who were beginning their hike that day also. I was number 841 of the thru hikers that had registered since Jan 1, 2014. I couldn't believe it was actually happening. Here I am and I am ready to go. Mama Bear was also anxious to get on the road to Cade's Cove. I was anxious , excited and ecstatic to begin the 8.5 mile hike up to Springer Mt. Shelter. The steep trail leading up to the 604 steps going straight up to the top of the falls is no joke. This is the third time I have climbed these steps, once a year ago with a friend who I brought up last fall , and when I attended the ATKO. Mama Bear took some photos and movie at the trail archway and I am on my way to living a 10 year dream , to do a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. I thanked Mama Bear for sharing her time with me listening to her talk about doing trail magic. Mama bear can't hike due to physical limitations , but she never tires about talking about doing trail magic. It's her dream and calling. She loves doing trail magic as much as I enjoy getting here to begin my journey. I set foot and immediately met two or three other individual hikers. It was. 9:30 am and here goes the journey. I hiked up to the stairs , and then up and on to the lodge and on out of the parking lot and across the road and up and up on my way to Springer Mt. , the southern terminus of the At. I had hoped to reach springer Mt shelter by late afternoon. I hiked for almost 10 hours and still didn't make it to the summit of springer. The approach trail is an extremely difficult and challenging hike. When I set out on the hike I decided that it was time for me to quit smoking. I didn't smoke any that first day. I found myself having to take several short breaks going up the approach . I hiked on into the night. I thought I would never reach a shelter or a camp. I actually thought I could reach springer before dark. But because I had to stop and take many breaks , there was no way for me to make it in my timeline. There were many hikers who were passing me up. I felt terrible. But after going a few feet taking a 5min break I was always ready to push on. I finally came upon some hikers who camped at trail side which wasn't really a camp site but it did have a water source of a small stream. It hadn't been dark very long but they were still up and I ask if I could camp with them. I just didn't want to hike any further in the dark with so many rocks and stones laying in the trail for you to trip on. The terrain was difficult and steep where I had to pitch my tent. I pitched up against a tree on the uphill side. By morning my tent surrounded the tree almost. I didn't sleep well that night. My bag kept sliding also.   I finally fell asleep no supper.   I was too tired and wore out.","Amicalola Falls State Park

I finally got on the trail at about 10:30am. I had a 7 mile hike up to Swim Bald at An elevation of 4710ft. It was a very steep climb. I made it to my destination at Sassafras Gap a Shelter just before dark. I finally found a suitable camp spot which is almost impossible when one arrives late into a camp site. I just finished setting up my tent partially in the dark , when it began to rain. I crawled in my tent and made some rice soup and went to sleep. Sent from my iPhone","Nantahala Outdoor Center

I was very anxious to get going. I arrived at the shelter at about 4pm. There were only 2 other hikers there, ""Ducktape and John who doesn't have a trail name yet. .

I hiked uphill for about an hour or so. It was steep. But NC trails do have 
switch backs unlike GA. 
I was so excited to be heading to Fontana to resupply before getting into the 
Smokies. I wanted to reach Fontana early to get a hostel or something because it 
was going to rain again. 
The wind seems to follow a rain storm. And on top of the balsa the wind blows 
about 40 mph 
I reached the road crosswind to Fontana Dam at 11 am. I called for a shuttle to 
take me to the lodge where I would stay the night. Meanwhile I took a shower 
went shopping in the small resort grocery and had a hamburger at the local 
restaurant. 
There is a Mini Cooper car function goin on here. The population of Fontana is 
only 33. But there are about 500 or more. Cooper cars on the road. Imagine a 
small town where there is no other kind of car on the road except Mini Coopers. 
It's really funny. 
I am going to crash early and get a good night sleep before hiring the trail 
tomorrow morning to cross Fontana Dam and head into the smokies. 
I am carrying extra weight due to extra food, 8 days worth to get me through the 
Smokies. Remember I only have 8 days to get through the Smokies 
I packed up early. It didn't rain but again I woke up at. 3 am with back pain. 
I couldn't get comfortable sleeping on the floor with my sleepad and my sleeping 
bag. I finally dozed off when I was awakened by an owl and a cyaoty at 5am. 
I made oatmeal and coffee and I was off at 7am. John and Ducktape were just 
waking up.

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516396,"I am ready to get back on the trail in 2016. So I am beginning my planning now that it's confirmed. I had to come off the trail due a an injury as I entered the Smokies. After being on the trail 31 days then, I have a better understanding of what gear I ONLY need to take. So yesterday I got out my pack, and sorted out my gear, checking off the essentials and reviewing what I have and need. I discovered that I was missing some key items. What a bummer   So I began making a list of items that I am going to replace and items that need to be purchased. I will post these items as I squirt them and update my gear list. Additionally, I have been researching alternative hiking options. I want to see the colors in Va which I have never seen. I am still exploring options and researching to be able to select a plan that will be feasible. One option I am investigating is the Flop Flop. Beginning at Harper's Ferry in VA to Mt. Kathaden then returning to Harper's Ferry and hike SOBO finishing up at the southern entrance of the Smokies. More about all that at a later date. Now here it is again. The planning, making preps and getting the word out that I am going back. I will elaborate on the whole situation in a few days. However with that said, I am determined and am better prepared as I move forward. I think of all my younger Brothers , especially Dennis that would love so much to hike with me. Perhaps when he gets ready to do the whole thing, I would hike it a second time with him. I also think of my good friend Mama Bear, who drove me to the Southern Terminous in 2013. I know she isn't able physically to take on a challenge of this magnitude. She has offered to transport me back to start again. Bless her and her family, for there are many people who call themselves friends, but this Lady is a TRUE friend and we both have a love for the outdoors and mountains and all its beauty. It's late, and I do have to be up for work at 5:30am. It's been raining all day and it's still raining here in Northwest Florida Panhandle. Forecast says rain thru Wednesday. I am so excited that I am able to go back and finish it up. I wonder about my hiking partner I had (Wave) who had to come off the trail before me.

Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522021,"Hello guys. It's getting close to departure date. Oh how I remember the first attempt and now it's about to resume after 2 years. I first must apologize for not posting more about my exit at Nantahala Dam after an injury that caused me to leave the trail. I went into deep depression that lasted a year and a half. But now I am well healed and all aspects of being able to go back to complete the thru hike is now at fruition. I am more excited about returning to do a thru hike. It really is disappointing to have had so much invested, in time, equipment, planning and not to mention the joy I was having the 31 days on the trail. However it comes to mind, during the first couple of weeks I was on the trail in 2014, I learned that a guy who was on his way to Springer had his backpack stolen at the airport in Atlanta. His 2014 thru-hike ended before he set foot. So I humble myself and rejoice in the fact that my delima then was insignificant. I am truly blessed to be able to go back and fulfill a dream. I also hope that the guy who had his pack stolen was or is able to start anew. I now am retired since last October 2015 and am joyfully employed at Pinnacle Pointe Apartments. They have given me their blessings to take a leave and complete my hike. That is so awesome and I am ever so grateful that the entire staff and some residents are giving me their full support and blessings. Additionally, I was visiting my Mother the other day when she gave me her full blessing to go. My Dad passed away just recently and it's been tough. Thanks Mom. I Love You My Dear friend Barbara, AKA Mama Bear drove all the way up from Northwest Florida to Nantahala Dam to pick me up off the trail and bring me home. Now she says that she would be extremely disappointed if I didn't ask her to take me back to begin my hike again. She is truly a Trail Angel   I ask that God continue to Bless all my supporting Family, friends and followers as I set out to do this hike again. I updated my gear list ( water filter and boots. Sunny today and warm. More to follow. Stay tuned.",,Starting over,"Feb 28, Sun",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522717,"Well here it is March 2016, and the countdown has begun. I purchased a new pair of hiking pants today from Backcountry.com. A bit expensive but I feel from all the reviews they will serve me well.   I also purchased a new pair of boots, Vasque brand from online shoes.com. I gave my written request for a Leave of Absence on Mondsy of this past week. I am so grateful that my employer is allowing me the time off to hike the AT.  It's been a very busy week trying to get things done and last minute purchases completed. It is now looking like I will have a hiking partner to accompany me on my journey. I am hoping that is comes through. I am keeping an eye on the weather up in the Smokies and it might be possible I will encounter snow at some point during the 8 to 10 days of hiking through the park. I also received a call from Lewis, aka Wave this past week. I had met him back in 2014 while hiking and we hiked a few weeks together before he had to leave the trail as mentioned in a previous journal entry. We had a very long interesting chat and talked for about 3 hours about our experiences post coming off trail   But with that said he is planning to possibly hook up with me at Hot Springs, North Carolina. It was good to hear from him and I am looking forward to seeing him. I can't sleep at night. All I do is toss and turn while in a twlight sleep. Haven't had any real REM sleep. But then, I guess it's a normal thing. I just am so excited to be out there again. Countdown : 21 Days",,Countdown,"Mar 06, Sun",0
Lil Cub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556253,"Today is Monday, I left Gatlinburg to reach Clingmans Dome Visitors Center where I came off to get some rest and resupply. I was able to get a shuttle from the NOC for $5 up to the parking lot at the Dome. There were 10 other hikers plus one older female named Whimpie. The ride up to the Dome was a leisurely ride where we encountered our Bear Block just outside Gatlinburg. Awesome to see a bear feeding right along the highway in the woods. After arriving back to the parking lot at the Dome I walked up a very steep paved path that led to the Dome. It was very difficult carrying a fully loaded pack. Thank goodness there were many resting benches and or bolders that I as well as many of the tourist took advantage of as well, and they weren't carrying a fully loaded pack either. There were lots of visitors. I took some awesome photos up on the Dome. Many of the visitors had never seen a Thru-hiker and so many were very rude. The Dome was extremely crowded. But I wasn't going to let the neg vibes keep me from taking in the awesomeness of the views. 
Leaving the Dome I hiked down 3.4 miles today over very rocky path. It was strenuous as heck. I arrived at Mount Collins Shelter about 3pm. The shelter only had a couple of other Thru-hikers. 
Then, suddenly the place filled up like a great steak house on a Friday night. I wanted to stealth camp so I waited for the shelter to fill up. In the Smokies, hikers are required to stay in shelters unless it's FULL. The shelter was full up including 4 reservations. Also the camping areas around the shelter got jammed up as well. Maybe 35 or more tents, I lucked out by getting there early. 
Tomorrow I plan to hike about 7 miles.","Silers Bald Shelter

While I was in Erwin, I was staying at the Super 8 because the Hostel Uncle Johnny's was full. I sampled the local flavor from a place called Pal's. It was a drive-thru only place, so I just walked right up to the window. They gladly served me with GREAT SERVICE. I hiked 4 miles up out of Erwin to Curley Maple Gap Shelter. There were three other hikers there and many more arrived and after a break hiked on. I met #Yard Sale, #XPo, #Jersey Boy and #Just Drew. All are great guys. I feel that the 2 days zero I had in Erwin, has definitely taken its toll. As I got off the trail, Uncle Johnny's was right there. I stopped in and has a great visit with many other Thru-hikers. I also bought some gifts to send home to my Brothers and resupply of fuel, ramen and tp. The hike out out took me four hours to reach the shelter and I have been here at Curley Maple Gap Shelter since about 2:30pm. It's now 6:30pm and still have daylight till around 8pm or so.
