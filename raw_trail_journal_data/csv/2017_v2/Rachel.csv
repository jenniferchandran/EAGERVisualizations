Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554927,"Well, here is journal entry one! I am starting to research gear for my section hike start this summer (hopefully). Being from CT, I am planning to hike CT and if time allows up into MA. I figure it will be a good shorter hike to test out gear and enjoy some summer days. No dates firm yet, since it depends on the kids having someone to watch them and my hub deciding if he wants to come along. Right now gear is....well....non-existent. Except bandanas! So, a lot of planning to go. I do hope to get a tent or maybe a hammock so I don't have to depend on the shelters.",,Hello!,"Feb 21, Tue",0
Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554928,"It is tough to figure out what I need for this short section hike that will be during the CT summer. I want whatever gear I get to be good for the whole trail. I am thinking that I will go for a -15 synthetic sleeping bag and a freestanding tent. But I am really drawn to the hammocks. I need to read more about how they are for folks in the cold and in the heat. My first goal is to get/find/beg/borrow a backpack. I think I will go to EMS since if it doesn't work for me on the week or so I have to hike, I have heard they are good about returns and exchanges. I want to try and keep the pack to 2lbs. Those three things are what I am most concerned with. and SHOES! I have my trail runners, and I might just go with them.",,Gear - Summer,"Feb 21, Tue",0
Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556685,"So, when to start. It is a mix of finding the best time to hike where it is comfortable and hopefully not mosquito crazed and when is best for the family. I am thinking late June will be the time.I got $200 in gift cards for Cabela and I think I found a pack that will be a good fit. I just need to get there to try it out. And then I need to buy my other supplies. But I would like to have my pack first so I can start seeing how everything will fit.",,Setting a Date,"Mar 17, Fri",0

Only thing I am still watching is the weather to make final clothes choices. I am at about 27 pounds with full food sack and 1 liter of water. Not awful. It looks like some rain the first two days but a bit cooler than this week. I plan to be on trail by about 1 on Sunday and hopefuly will make it the 8 miles I plan before the rain.

Hoping to be on trail by 1 or 1:30. The weather today looks like it should be ok, maybe a thunderstorm. The plan is to go 8 and camp at the campground. The issue looks to be severe weather tomorrow. I wanted to get to Silver Lake, which has at least a pavilion if the weather gets bad but depending on how the day is going, I may stop earlier at a shelter.

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569099,Rough first day. I think just not hydrated enough. And Guthook kept telling me .2 miles and then jumping up. Which was discouraging.

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569283,"What a day! I woke up early, no surprise. Slept some and spent a good deal of the night listening to the stream gurgle by. Hit the trail around 6:30 hoping to get to either the Shelter or Silver lake. They are only 2 miles or so apart and it was mostly based on weather. The day started off with a big climb and a pretty view from Mt Algo. I was making ok time. I stopped around 11 to refill my water bottles and had some food. Then the climb up to Caleb's peak and the ledges. Super rocky. I went very slow because I'm a klutz and around rammed my thumb on day 1. Made it up without issue. And then the rain started to drip. I pulled on my pack cover. And it started to pour. POUR. Just as I started coming down on the ledges which is rock climbing (look it Up! No pics bc....rain). Took forever to get down but managed to only bang one knee and fall/slide on my butt once. Once down, it's a road walk, ah, and then along the river. Made up a bunch of time. Stopped to talk for a minute to a NOBO who had been just ahead of me at Ledges and was chilling under his tarp. Made it to the Shelter and called it a day around 2. Monkey showed up a bit after and hung out for a hour. He was friendly. Hadn't showered since DE (beside rivers) but I told him he didn't smell. Got changed and I've been reading. Ate a little. Stomach not liking food so eating little snacks. Rain started up strong again around 4, and we are up to me and 3 others at shelter. Betting we get a few more. Hopefully i sleep. Tomorrow has some big climbs, so I'm hoping to do another 10.  Oh, I forgot!  I saw a sweet baby deer and a bunch of hummingbirds early in the day.

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569333,"I didn't sleep great but was dry!  Getting up and putting cold wet clothes on stunk. I hit the trail around 630. After about 3, I reached Silver Lake campground and stopped yo try and force down a snack. I got to a river that had a sign about a road bypass. I was deciding when Monkey showed up and said he was going to backtrack  (uphill of course) so I decided to also. That added a mile of road walking. No pics because my phone was away. I stopped at some pretty falls to try and eat some more and refill water. Went by a beautiful overlook. Currently sitting at Caesar Brook campsite at noon. Trying to decide if I should enjoy the afternoon after 8 miles or push on the last 3.3 to the next shelter. Need to tend to my poor left baby toe and a few smaller places. 
So decided to stay. The inability to eat seems tied to the fact my skin feels hot even a few hours after I stopped. Resting and reading and enjoying the beautiful stream. Going to cook and hopefully eat a little more food. It's bad when I don't even want my chocolate. Hoping to be settled for the night by 5 and feeling better tomorrow. Tomorrow will be 8 again probably. But depends on how many times we go up up up and down down down. 

I found a great video that shows what the river that we decided to bypass was like. It was exactly like it was for us. It comes up at 1:10. Google Red Beard Appalachian Trail: 10 Mile River & Rattlesnake - 104.","Stewart hollow brook shelter

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569456,"A great day but a rough night. I woke up at 2 shaking and unable to stop. I wasn't cold, but shaking. I finally fell asleep for maybe another hour. Then I forced myself up and out around 630. I had to refill water first thing. I decided to stop at least 15 min at each shelter, so about every 3 miles, today. Just after the first, I met Jesse's girl and Grace Note as we were all refilling. Jesse is section hiking and this is her final push up to Katahdin. Grace planned to stop July 7, but she called her husband after the water stop and when we met up at my next rest, he had told her she had her trail legs and should just keep going. She wasn't sure what she was going to do. There were 3 big climbs and some nice views. My legs must be getting more accustom because they felt not quite as hard as the last 2 days. 
So, it's just past 1230. I hate to stop early but the other option is 7 miles up the next huge climb which I'm not up for. I could also go 3 into town and camp there. The idea of a Sprite makes that sooooo appealing but camping roadside not so much. Jesse gave me two propel packs and they seem to be helping. That will have to do. 
I'm going to set up and then study the guide to see what makes sense. I don't want to stop because despite not feeling 100% and getting my @$$ handed to me on some inclines, it is beautiful and peaceful. But I also really want a Sprite and some Nyquil. Hoping signal is good enough to post my backlog of pics. Will try.","CEASAR BROOK CAMPGROUND

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569467,"ok, so I am sitting in my tent reading and this HUGE tree splits in half and falls like 20 ft outside my tent. Scared me to death. Just now, I came out to make some veggie broth (food still enemy) and the tree also fell across the campsites entrance. Check out the 3 pictures. crazy.
Since I'm writing, the plan is to hike about 5-6 tomorrow and then hike back into town. Paul will pick me up tomorrow night. There is a tough day ahead beyond that with not much of a way to get a pick up. Since I am barely eating. It seems stupid to push for that last day (since Saturday I planned to get picked up early). Still I think it is the right move. I've had a great adventure.
Now, honest to god, go look at those pictures.","

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569537,"So the roughest night yet. Glad I made the call for pickup today. Slept hardly at all and was sweating and shaking. No fun. Got going at 730, making my way to Great Falls. Made good time as lots of flat and some road bits here and there. Met a nice man out with his dog who told me where to find an ATM in town. At one road, there was a trash can AND a lady with her dog who grabbed my trash bag out of its pouch and trashed it. I'm sure it was like a pound but felt like more! Now I am at the falls, via a side trail, soaking my feet and drinking the second propel Jesse gave me. 
Have lots of time so enjoying sound of the falls and drying in the sun. Will head to town to get there  (about a mile and a half) by noon or so. The restaurant that I'm hoping has my Sprite is only open until 2. And cash only, hence the ATM. Maybe they will have something I can pick at too. Off to soak and read.","BELTERS BROOK CAMPSITE

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569664,"So, I hung at Toymakers all afternoon in the shady chairs out back. A great little spot that was hopping all day. Annie and Greg are the owners and live upstairs. They are super hiker friendly. Letting folks tent in the lot and just being generally agreeable to large smelly groups of hungry people!
Weighed myself when I got home, after a nice shower, to find I was down over 7 pounds. In 4 days. So, regardless of if I also was fighting the bug going around, figuring out how to get food into me is going yo be key for my next adventure. 
Hoping to have a chance to go out 3-4 more days late in the summer and wrap up the last bit of CT and first bit of MA. Those will be tough since they include some big climbs like Bear Mountain.
Looking forward already to getting back in the woods.",,View Entry,"Jun 23, Fri",0

July 25.  Yippeee!!!  I will get to wrap up CT and get a head start on MA for next year. In prep, I got a sleeping bag, which I didn't have last time. Not sure yet if I will bring it, really will depend on forecast. But the elevations are higher and I want to have that option. I also got an alcohol stove. It's a pound less than my wood burning stove. I love my wood burner but having to carry backup in case I can't find dry fuel made the weight high. Otherwise,  same gear. Should be lighter with less food and clothes.

And excited to use my new zpack arc pack. Better fit and 3 less pounds. Which is great. Once it is here, I can see where I am in terms of weight. Plan is to get to Upper Goose Pond in MA, and get picked up just after the AT goes over the Pike. But that requires everything goes perfectly, so likely won't get quite that far!!

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571970,"A week and a bit until I head back out to finish the last bit of CT and as much of MA as I can. I have cut down a bunch of weight, which I am happy about. I got a new Z Pack Arc backpack, which cuts off 3 lbs of weight from my old pack. I also decided to get a new stove. With those reduced, I am adding in an ultralight Burrow Econ 40 quilt. It is just over a pound, which I am making up by bringing less clothes. I feel better knowing I have that if it gets cold. I will be at higher elevations than last month and want to be prepared. My math says that with the pack, quilt, tent, sleeping pad and cooking stuff (pot, stove, fuel) I am at 7 lbs 4 ozs. I'm pretty happy with that. The odds and ends I need to add will be around 3 lbs, so I should be able to make one more pass and be under 10 for my base weight. I have to carry a fair amount of food to start since I don't plan to resupply along the way, so I really want that base as low as I can.",,View Entry,"Jul 14, Fri",0
Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572991,"First day back on the trail. It was pouring. Started out around 830. Terry joined me for the first bit, which was so nice. First summit was Mt Prospect. Then it levelled out some and some smaller ups and downs. I was worried because it was pretty chilly, but it stopped raining eventually and got a bit warmer. Next summit was Lions Head. I got there as the clouds were clearing. It was beautiful. Took a video but quickly moved on because brr. I stopped for water and a snack and then lunch as I moved along. I was surprised several times when the next landmark appeared and I was surprised to have gotten there already.  I got to Brassie Shelter and had to decide if I wanted to do the shelter or go on over Bear Mtn to a campsite about 2 miles away. Had mom check the weather and since it was it 130, I headed on. I was super nervous about Bear but it was fun. Lots of boulders but that makes it go faster because my mind is focused on not slipping (fell twice, neither time on Bear). Made the summit and had a snack,  took some pics. Made It here around 315. So pace was good considering the terrain. Tomorrow I hope to make it 14 to Rte 7 where Jess Treat who runs a hostel and lets hikers tent will shuttle me to get place. Hopefully I can get there. 
Only other news. I forgot 1 comfy thing. My sleeping pad. Must be in my old pack because it wasn't on the floor with my other gear. Hopefully my tent platform (yup) doesn't kill me.","Great Falls

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573121,"What a day. Without the sleeping pad, I didn't sleep much at all. It also poured almost all night. By morning it was just light rain. I was on trail about 630. First, was through Sage' s Ravine with beautiful waterfalls and swimming holes. A bit too cold for them today!! Took a bunch of pics. Even though the border is technically on Bear, the sign is in the ravine. I signed the Mass register and headed to the first summit of the day, Mt Race. Not too steep but long. Not sure which is better! The ledges near the summit gave my only below cloud view of the valley, but just barely. The other summit's had me swimming in clouds. After Race, a pretty steep descent. The hardest of the Day was My Everett. Super steep rock face. Goes to 2600 ft in .5 mile. Actually these wooden steeps anchor in the rock to make manageable. Glad I was going up on those and not down. Again, no view except the remaining footing of the old fire tower. I met a hiker up there and we laughed that it might be the only fire tower with a gravestone. After that, some ups and downs to Mt Bushnell and Jugs End. Then the last 5 or so miles was a lot of small hills, marshes, bogs and road crossings. I saw a bunny in one field. Best thing was snacks with AT cows! Met Colorado Banjo at the Shays Rebellion memorial. Chatted for about 20 minutes and took pics of each other under pretty arch and at memorial. Made it to the road at 245 and Terry pulled in a minute later. He was a trail angel today, bringing me the sleeping pad,  wall plug and a cupcake!
I'm at the hostel now, clean and DRY. I was going to tent but decided to get a room instead to hopefully get caught up a bit on rest. Looks like choices tomorrow are 6 or 11. Going to study guide a bit but most likely will try for the 11. The only issue is my stupid @$$ pinky toes. Again! Even with the toe sock liners under my socks. I actually screamed at one point when it moved funny and hobbled awhile after until it resorted itself. 
Since have Wi-Fi here, going to upload pics. Don't think I can label on phone, but they should hopefully be added in order. Also, you can say hi to me by signing the guest book :)

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573239,"What a Day! Enjoyed breakfast with Kai (Jesse's son), Poppi and Good Wife. Got a late start, on trail at 8. Made good time early with lots of smaller rises and nice stretches levelish trail. Clear day but only one summit with a view. But pretty. Got to Benedict pond (pretty) and met Mark who was having lunch. Chatted.  Then I stopped to refill water and chatted. Hiked together the rest of the day off and on. I'd lose him on inclines but he's catch up when I had snacks or got water. We are sharing a campsite, which is nice. My first hiking partner. He didn't have a trail name so I named him Schwin because he rides his bike 20 miles a day. Got to camp at 430ish. Schwinn got in about 30 minutes later. We filled up on water. 
Only neg is I let myself get dehydrated. Maybe the higher temp even though was in shade. So forcing myself to slowly drink a liter of lemonade and eating my noodles. Oh and my stove wigged out. Can't turn it off. So as soon as screw on I have to light and it sounds like a blow torch. But ok. Then I realized I could it shut off by unscrewing.  Which made a fireball big enough that I checked to be sure my hair wasn't on fire. Tomorrow I will borrow someone's I think. 
Well goes to finish my noodles and lemonade so I can go bear box my food. Then going to read and relax. Thinking of later start since few miles but I can't wait to get my feet in that pond!","Route 7 (Jess Treat's)

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573366,"What a fun day. So got up and out at 630. There was a pretty view first thing at the cobbles and also some pastures. Oh, the campsite sits on an old shaker village. The barn foundation is still there. There were two climbs today and I was feeling, or not feeling it. But I got to Goose Pond cabin at 1158. My huge goal was noon though I figured 100. The extra reward was the caretaker (this is a maintained cabin) had decided to make pasta and corn on the cob!  If I'd gotten here at 1 I would have missed out. Some hikers who came after me, around 130, asked if we'd seen the bear.  Apparently after I passed a road crossing, someone had put out a cooler of watermelon trail magic. So this bear, who supposedly was huge, was hanging around it eyeing everyone who was getting it. But people knew because NOBOs told SOBOs and vice versa. 
The cabin has a a small kitchen, a sitting room with a fire all afternoon, and a top floor bunkroom for 15 of us. And pretty sure we have more than that. So glad I got here and grabbed a bunk early.
Tomorrow the plan is to get up and enjoy breakfast which starts around 6 and then head to a trail landmark, the cookie lady. Reports are she isn't around, but I will pick some blueberries.","Shaker Village Campground

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573432,"Had a pleasant rest of the afternoon and evening relaxing in the cabin. 25 smelly hikers and gear in one room with no windows or open doors = very hot smelly room. Still did sleep some. Up at 515. I was originally thinking of hanging a but, but decided to just get going eventually. So hit the trail before 630. It was a pretty easy morning with one real climb and another minor one. Some up and down but good amount of more level. I got to cross the bridges over the Mass pike which was neat. Passed a pretty pond and a field. The second half was all mud. So I was soon covered from the knee down. In one area, my hiking pole in the water spooked out a frog, so I got a good picture of him. Got to the road at 1230ish, again timing perfectly with Terry. 
I then scooted the .1 to the famous Cookie Lady's house. No one was home but I signed the log. I didn't want to pick without them there since nothing said the cost or where I could safely put cash. So I picked Terry a handful, popping a second handful in my mouth as I went along.  Yum!

The first several miles flew and I made the first summit of Warner (?) Hill. That's the pic. Pretty views! There was a good amount of levelish trail and I arrived at a cool power line crossing shocked to be there already. The downs were tough on my aching knees and both arches throbbed. I saw a beautiful deer and a million teeny brown frogs. Got a pic of the deer i will post later. Made it into Dalton, 9.8 miles, just before 5. I'm staying in the yard of trail angel Tom Levardi.

So I was up and over at the Cumberland Farm right after it opened to use theirs and get a Gatorade. I made pretty good time. It was mostly inclines and flats. I stopped at the intersection with the first shelter for a snack and then at the very pretty summit called The Cobbles for early lunch. Then down into Cheshire. I got to Deb' s, a tiny sandwich spot on trail just as it was opening and grabbed a Gatorade and sat for a bit at the picnic tables out back. Next was the climb up Greylock. I am staying at Mark Noepel shelter in my tent in a tent pad. Just 3 miles tomorrow up to the summit, where I hope to spend some time, before the 7 to the next shelter which is just 3 or so from the VT line. Pretty chilly here.

I didn't sleep great, but was up and out around 630. I only had 1 bottle of water but knew I could fill at the lodge. The first 3 miles up to Greylock were mostly up and down, with a little flat. The whole time smelled like Christmas. A mile out, I could see the monument and all I could think was that it looked way higher than where I was. So, yup, lots of climbing! I got to the summit and headed to the lodge which was beautiful. Big fireplace. Just pretty. I filled water and talked with Nightwalker who had stayed there last night. A nice angel he had met paid for his room which was kind. I went and sat by the monument, which I had all to myself, and ate my breakfast. Then I headed out, because I was getting chilly. Mostly downs for the next 3 or so and stopped for a snack at the junction with a shelter. I wish I knew the gorgeous view just .2 further! So I stopped just for a few to enjoy that.  Then about 3 miles to Rte 2 in North Adams. I headed off trail about .5 to the Stop and Shop plaza where there is a hiker friendly Papa Johns.  Ordered pizza and soda, and then ran next door to grab a Gatorade. Back to Papa Johns. They give hikers half off, will wrap leftover so you can pack out, have a hiker box (where I dropped a few things I won't get to) and let you use the bathroom. Super people. Took my longest break ever, about an hour 20 min in all.  I ate 3 pieces but decided not to pack out because without cheese it gets messy. Then back to the trail and off. Leaving town the trail literally goes up this family's driveway. They keep a hose out there with a Note that it is for hikers. Sweet. 2 miles of up found me here at Sherman Brook at 2. I really wanted to go on, but this made sense. And nice to have a resting couple hours. Since so early and no one here, I could get changed at my campsite instead of in the tent. Which was nice. Filtered a Gatorade bottle full of water from a beautiful spring, drank and filtered a second bottle. So cold and crisp. Should have enough to not have to fill up again.

After about 2 miles, he grabbed a taxi back to the jeep and headed home. I plugged on alone. Lots of ups and downs, but I made it to the RPH shelter at 1.  It's a unique shelter in that it was a cabin that they have removed a wall from. It has a water pump which was fun. There was a volunteer crew there working on a large blow down that lucky fell away from the shelter. I enjoyed lunch and some ice. old watermelon they have me, as well as fun conversation. After the break, it was up up up. I got to the tentsite I had planned to stay at but it was 2. So I decided to head on the 4.5 to Canopus lake. That took me the rest of the way up Shanendoah Mountain, which I swore at often! At the top, is the well known and offer seen flag painted on the rocks which was painted as a memorial to 9-11. From this spot you can just make out the NYC skyline. Where normal people go for vacation. I got here at 4 and bought a lemonade at the concession. Been chatting with Not Dead for a bit and now in my tent relaxing and avoiding the bugs. Going to check out tomorrow's plan and then read until dark.Hugs to Paul for putting up with the hike and giving me company. I really enjoyed you being here. <3","Stealth site, nuclear lake

Lots of ups and downs and while they shouldn't have wasted me, they sure did. I drank about 5 L of water during the day and still was feeling dehydrated. I soaked my feet to cool off and chill them. I got to the monastery around 2. As I headed up the hill, the bells were playing. So pretty.
I rinsed off in the coldest shower ever which felt nice. All there is some ice which made the water much nicer. Been talking to a thru hiker from IN (Beaver Pelt) and Snickers, a section hiker from Ellington! Both nobo. Chatted with both individually for awhile. Have yet to see another person going solo. About to go read and plan tomorrow. With the heat, I may have to be extra flexible.

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594548,"This was the day the trail decided to teach me a lesson in flexibility and humility. Haha to plans said the trail. Knowing it was going to be a scorcher, I headed out early, around 530. I was told the .6 to the market I was headed to first was mostly downhill. As I went along I was getting discouraged because it sure felt mostly uphill and like the longest .6 ever. So I get to a ledge and pull out guthook to find I've gone 2 miles north. North. Which explained the trail since I had now resumitted my last climb from yesterday. 
So rather than go on this same trail a third time, I head the last .5 to the next road crossing. After calling 8 cabs, I find a guy willing to come get me and return me to where I started. I just couldn't do that same piece again!!
So now back the right way, I hit some trail landmarks, the Hudson River bridge and lowest point of the trail in the trackside zoo. The zoo opens at 10, so I was happy the gate was open at 945 (otherwise you have to take the bypass trail). I stroll through and see the famous bears and Walt Whitman. I get to the front gate. Locked. Like an animal at the zoo ironically. Someone came to let me out while the line waiting to get in sort of chuckled at me. 
The I came to the Bear Mtn Inn, a fancy not hiker spot (there is a cheap spot up in Fort Montgomery but the inn is on the trail). My wonderful hub got me a room. I was feeling the heat so I drank a liter of water and had some lunch and dill pickle potato chips. Then I headed up to the Perkins Tower which was 1200 climb over 1.5 miles, mostly stairs) and i wanted to die. It is the absolute slowest i have ever gone because i kept sitting and drinking because i was so queasy. I also got a nice pic of the Hudson but forgot to get one from the top because I was happy to head down. 3.8 miles took me 2hr30min or so and then I got a lift back.
I'm drinking water and then going to shower and relax. They have a restaurant I am hoping has food I can eat. Then going to plan for tomorrow. Although I'm not sure why i bother!!

After a thunderstorm overnight, I was even more glad I had stay at the Inn. I didnt feel great when I got up but got an early ride to where I stop yesterday and headed south this time!
I took it very slow to try and not get overheated or dehydrated. Still so hard to balance and food =boo. I saw some pretty views that had nice breezes. At the famous lemon squeeze I met a guy going nobo. He was sitting below and we helped swap packs down the steep rock which  was nice. Then had to shimmy without my pack on to get through the narrow section. I made it to the place I planned to stealth, based on a note in guthook, only to see to camp signs. I am not in between them so hoping I am not breaking any rules. But the next shelter was 6 miles. Which was not in the cards. 
I was able to drink two warm cups of veg broth while I sat to help get my sodium up. Now I am waiting on dinner. May have one more cup after. 
Then I am going to climb in tent get out of my nasty wet clothes and rest. Tomorrow I head into Warwick to get my box at the PO. There are lots of road crossings spread out so I will keep an eye on how I feel and the time to make sure I get there in time to get box and eat at the vegan spot.

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594754,"I spent awhile talking to a nobo who stopped at my tent spot to swim and grab a shuttle nearby last night. She echoed what I'd been hearing. That after Warwick is at least 18 dry miles and that she carried 4L water. I couldn't force more than half a clif bar down and headed out. Despite that, I felt good on the first climb. During Agony Pass (a steep rock scramble section), my chest strap broke off my pack. Grr. So, between that, the added weight and my promise to Paul to not kill myself, I decided to call today my last day. Bummed, but I guess it is good to stop. before I feel worse. Without the strap, the pack is tough, and I can't imagine when I add my food resupply of 6 pounds plus 8lb of water! So, I got to a good road crossing and now I'm at the Bellvale Creamery waiting on my ride. 
Overall, this year felt tougher even though the trail was about the same as last year. Maybe just the higher temps. My legs felt good the whole time which is good. My biggest struggle continues to be food/water which sounds dumb but it's TRUE.

It was nice he was there and we chatted for a good while. The last 5 miles dragged, not horrid just felt dragging, so I put on a book on tape which helped.

I left camp super early because with the rain and low clouds covering the summits, I was debating wrapping up today vs camping at the overlook of Blue mtn and doing 4 miles to the road tomorrow. The pic sums up all the low areas. Totally wet and underwater. And the summits put me in the clouds. In between, terrain felt very easy today. I was able to knock out the miles and finished before 2. I also didn't take the hour or so total breaks because it was too wet and cool to want to stop long. 
Then the adventure. I got to the road to find no weak signal. Was trying to wait for cab list from Google when a couple packing their trunk asked if I was ok. I explained I need to get back to my car and asked if they were headed toward DE Water Gap. Luckily for me they were and immediately offered to get me that far. I knew from there I could get an uber for the short drive to my car south of town. We had a great time. They were just out for the one night. Chatting about hiking, camping and gear. And then about all sorts of things. Like most hikers I've met, they were nice and fun to chat with.

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622646,"What a day! Hikers often say the trail provides and today it certainly did in a needed and unexpected way. 
After a goodbye to Paul and a 7am flight to Atlanta, I was picked up by a well know AT Shuttle driver, Ron. The drive was about 2.5 hrs but it sure didn't seem it. I got a tootsie pop and we talked AT as the files flew by. Got the Springer at 11:45 and after a picture for me and one for Ron, which promised to post for my mom:), I headed the one mile south the the summit of Springer Mtn, the southern terminus. I planned to take some pics and eat lunch before truly starting my northbound hike. I pull out the phone and find a text from Ron. We had so much fun we forgot to exchange money!!! So, quick pics from a day hiking couple after I took one of them and off I went. Got back to the lot, paid Ron and had my lunch. 
Miles were easy and I was chugging along. And then it happened. I'd been good about drinking and so I got to a water source at 4 miles (so 5 into my day), finish my smaller bottle and collected more to filter. Only the filter wouldn't filter. It worked last week when I tested it so my only guess is maybe it froze (bad) in the plane. I had 1 liter bottle and 1 16oz bottle plus 1 L of dirty. And I'd seen no one. Literally not a single person since Springer. 
So, I realize I will be stuck boiling water every hour or two until I get to Neeks gap in a few days where there is an outfitter. Stinks. But doable. I am making good time and am well hydrated so I try to to totally freak. 
I bypass the falls because I didnt want to tack on the mile. Then i get to a crossing where there is a small cemetary maybe 200 yards up a dirt road. I recall reading a church pulls water there sometimes and decide to go look. As i find nothing. A jeep pulls up with a family of four. Literally in the middle of no where. I ask if they by chance can top off my liter bottle. They nicely do and i explain the issue. And the dad says, I have a brand new Sawyer (filter) in my bag and pulls it out. I pretty much squeal and ask if I can buy it off him. He quickly agrees. So. Truly miraculous example of how the trail provides!!
Not much after that. Some ups and got to Hawk Mtn, mile 8.5 mi (9.5 for the day) at 3:45. Terrain will be harder from here. I would have liked to have a few more miles, but no shelter for about 5.

I strolled the main drag before the shops opened and enjoyed looking inside. Glass blowers, chocolate makers, a funnel cake store, old tyme photos and the German bakery to name a few. There is Betty's general store which, I kid not, has a inside-outside bar. You can sit in the patio with a drink or, if you prefer, do your grocery shopping!!
I also met Dan, the car rental guy who picked me up and brought me to Cleveland.  Super interesting guy who decided to show me a few spots on the way.
I saw Babyland General,  which was equal parts awesome nostalgia and overt creepiness. Those ladies were way to enthusiastic about the ""birth,""
I stopped by an Indian burual mound along the Chattahoochee River. Peaceful despite the surrounding roads, surrounded by a grass field and grazing horses, it was really beautiful.
I visited a grist mill and drive past several wineries.
Then, today, I enjoyed one last stop at the Huddle House, one more stroll to the clock and back before heading to ATL. Paul used points to get my flight and spent extra to upgrade md to first class. So sweet. So, it was a comfy flight home with a blanket and a mimosa.

Made fast time for the first three miles first over the Potomac on the new bridge and then on the bike path along the river. The old bridge was destroyed a year or two back by a train derailment. The climb wasn't that bad. They use switchbacks so there are short climbs and then either flat or gradual climbs. Back and forth. Much easier than the new England straight up and down. I got to the look out and was staring even though only 9:00. So ate my first lunch on the rocks. I planned to eat second lunch at Gathland State Park but was starving so stopped for a snack a mile from there to tide me over.

Same view, but no people! Great advice. It was amazing and I had it to myself while I snacked. I headed further than planned but felt good and this should be quieter.

So, I took the day slowly, especially the killer bit out of Bly. Blue sky and just a light breeze. Went about a mile past Deep Gap, and set up at a nice site near the Standing Indian Shelter. I was all setup by 1:30 so had a relaxes afternoon with my book. Should be cool but dry night.","Bly gap

Rachel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/645631,Got up and walked the short downhill back to the gap where Sherpa Al picked me up. Brought me to a great local breakfast spot and I enjoyed a leisurely breakfast. Walked the half mile into town and bought Paul a present at the Outdoors 76. Greg from Chica and Sunsets hostel came to get me with news that my car had a flat. He helped me change it and I ran to a local tire spot (very local lol). $12 and 15 minutes and good as new. All cleaned up and relaxed with my book and some knitting. All my stuff is cleaned and packed up. Tomorrow I have a few quick things I may do and then I fly home! Looking forward to relaxing weekend at home or the lake before I have to tackle my overflowing inbox.,"Standing Indian Shelter
