Thankfully, Greg was able to give Will directions to the spare keys in a box in the barn. We found a Mexican restaurant for lunch, and we had bread, goat cheese, and sundries tomato pesto pasta for dinner.It's grey, cool, and occasionally drizzly, but tomorrow should just be cloudy, and there will be thunderstorms on Monday!I am hiking the Appalachian Trail because:- I have wanted to since I knew about it.- I love hiking and the satisfaction from walking somewhere.- I want to prove that I can finish what I start. To prove that to myself.- I want to be more at ease with my social life, either by getting to be more social or being more at peace with being alone.- I want to spend time with Greg- I need a break from the normal course- I want to think about a lot of things to do with my place in the world and what I want it to be.",,Katahdin Stream Campground,"Jun 16, Fri",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570476,"We did it! it was cloudy and foggy down here, but absolutely stunning and sunny above tree line. We made much better time than four years ago, and I feel better about it. Lots of people.
I am completely exhausted now, but that's at least in part because I haven't slept well or much for several nights. The other part is because I climbed a giant mountain today.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570497,"The trail was rough today- lots of roots, rocks, and very recent blowdowns. And mud! But we stuck it out, and I never got quite too negative. Even with cramps, lady issues, and high humidity, I could still smile.
The last two miles were lovely, too- we stayed next to the lake, but where that had previously meant mud and dirt it changed to huge old cedar trees that clearly drank enough water to make the ground a bit drier. It was like walking in a fairytale, and with little blue dragonflies everywhere.
The two couples from the lean-to last night are here. Delaney is here, too, and it looks like we'll be staying at the same places for a few days, which is nice.
It's raining now, and there's some thunder, too, so we're staying in the lean-to. Two other guys just showed up who are doing the 100 miles, and they're staying in the lean-to, too. Plus there's one other older southbounder here with his dog, Magnolia.
The heavy rain should help with the snoring that I'm sure is about to happen.","Hurd Brook Lean-to

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570498,"Holy shit I did 18 miles today. Ouch.
We intended to go to the Nahmakanta Stream campsite, but it was just completely swarmed with mosquitos. It was so bad that even though I was tired, we decided to hike on until we were out of the mosquitos. We are still not out of them here, but the other people have made a fire that helped keep them at bay while we socialized and had dinner.
It was a funky day for weather- showers off and on, sometimes sunny... but it seems to have worked out to tonight being cool, not humid, and with wind high in the trees.
I've got blisters on my heels even though I have never had that problem before. I will wear dry socks and take it easy tomorrow.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570503,"I saw a moose! It was running away already and so Greg missed it, but it was really great. 
I forgot to write yesterday about how at one point a huge chunk of tree fell down about 3 feet from Greg. There was much alarm and loud swearing. We'll have to be extra careful about widowmakers while walking in addition to while camping? There are so, so many blowdowns that are still green from recent storms. It can be hard to navigate them without losing the trail.
My blisters are a little bit better. I'm treating them with neosporin.
We have the same batch at this shelter- Bill, Stewart, Skeeter Beater, Julia, and the two southbound section hikers. Two northbound section hikers rolled in late, too.
It was sunny this morning, but I took a rough fall in a brook and scraped up my elbow. We got to a beach then, and checked the weather and found out it was going to storm... and it did. The rainwater was almost as cold as Potaywadjo Spring. It cleared up after that, and we escaped from the mosquitoes up here. Tomorrow is supposed to be sunny, too!","Potaywadjo Stream Lean-to

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570856,"We got some good uphills today, but we did it just fine. Stewart let us get rid of our trash with his food drop, so that was really nice. My socks dried out on top of my pack so I was able to change into dry socks after a ford, and it felt amazing. I think my blisters are getting better.
The trail went through some lovely fir groves today. We're halfway up Whitecap Mountain!
At one point today, Greg called out to me to say that he loves me and he's glad we're out here. It was such a relief to know that I haven't just dragged him miserably out here.
We're sleeping in the shelter tonight since there aren't really any good tent sites. Maybe if we're up early we could do a longer day tomorrow, too- we're only planning less than 8 miles, but if we can do more, it could give us a near-0 into Monson, which would be nice.
It's chilly up here, and that's great!
Fewer people than last night, but we'll see if any more show up.The photo is of a lovely pond we walked past today. There was such a wind coming off of it I was worried I'd lose my hat!","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to

We got to Carl Newhall shelter pretty early, so we decided to push on so that our day going into Monson would be shorter. I'm glad we did- not only do we get more time in town, we also get to stay in this beautiful place and be serenaded by frogs.

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570861,"First, trail stuff yesterday: 3rd Mountain had the best views, but the pitcher plants in fourth mountain bog were amazing- there were surprisingly few mosquitoes there for the amount of water.
I was a wreck at the end of the day, though- we pushed a little too hard for me between yesterday and the day before.
Today was short and beautiful. The views off of Barren Ledges were absolutely the best since Katahdin. We passed a trail crew doing great work.
Yesterday we met two super fast SOBOs, Nature Boy and Grandpa. They might make it here today by trail, whereas we had to get a shuttle in to make sure Greg is available for a Skype interview tomorrow.
We took lovely hot showers, ate fries and pizza, and relaxed. We got a new titanium spoon and some more aqua mira. I was having a late snack of tortilla chips and cheese dip and listening to my favorite music.
And then Greg got an email offering him the position he'd interviewed for at UC Davis. I am so happy for him. It is so perfect for his career. He will start well before we could possibly finish the trail, maybe as early as August 1st. This is so good for him, and relieves so much stress. 
I am incredibly conflicted emotionally, and trying so hard to hang on. I really want to do this, and I am so scared that I can't on my own. It's easy to have the thought that I can, but I need more of a conviction than that to not be just completely heartbroken at the end of my dream.
I know that I can reach my greatest strengths when I am alone and have nothing to fall back on. One of the reasons that I wrote that I want to do this is to be more socially comfortable alone.
There is a good batch of slow-speed people around me this time.
Greg can still come with me for a while. 
I've been just listening to really loud music for a while now. It makes me feel better. It's like I need to think, but not so much to think as to FEEL. 
Tomorrow I will go back out and get eaten alive by mosquitoes again, and ford streams, and be always damp. I will see incredible sights and meet a wide variety of people. I will write quotes from the 1983 Philosopher's Guide to the AT in registers.
Line from Japandroids:
""And it's an all-out war for the soul between
Dreams that are hungry and the fears that feed""
I will be supportive of Greg. I just hope he can figure out what support I need- which is he reassurance and confidence that I can do this crazy thing on my own.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570863,"I relaxed all morning at Shaw's, are donuts and French fries and onion rings, and then we got back to the trail this afternoon. We went over a hill with no name that we decided we should call Road Wart, due to its being near a road, having an elevation profile that looks like a wart, and being generally unpleasant.
I'm feeling good to do 13.7 miles tomorrow.","

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570864,"Okay, so we only went to the first road into Monson. It was thundering and I was tired. I'm still adjusting to the new facts of life. Had dinner at Lakeshore House with some great people. It seemed like everybody was there.
Life is good.","Wilson Valley Lean-to
",Shaw's ,"Jun 27, Tue",10.40
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570866,"Breakfast at Shaw's this morning was AMAZING. Really good home fries.
We got back to the trail around 9:30, and hiked for a little while with a guy named Ryan. He'd originally been hiking with his cousin who had to leave because he got hurt. They'd already done 500 miles down south before flipping up here.
The first 9 miles today were pretty smooth and easy. There was a group of campers at Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to, as well as a pair of northbounders.
The three miles after the lean-to were relatively flat looking in the guidebook and on the map. They were next to the river, except every few minutes when the trail would shoot 50-70 feet straight up the side of the hill, stay up there for a couple dozen steps, then shoot straight back down to the river... then do it again. None of the hills were big, but they were very steep and constant. It took a lot out of me.
I got really discouraged, too. A part of me feels like little hills like that shouldn't be a problem for me anymore, and that I'm not good enough to do this, not strong enough. I'm working on that, though. 12 miles is perfectly fine. We are camped in a lovely spot. And tomorrow we go over a beautiful mountain!
We had a chipotle cheddar pasta side for dinner and it was really tasty.","Shaw's 
",West branch of the Piscataquis River,"Jun 28, Wed",12
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570869,"I played a trick on my brain today and it worked! I got so discouraged yesterday about little hills. The ascent up Moxie Bald Mountain was rough. We planned on getting water at the Stream after the road (mile 139.7) and then finding a spot somewhere on the mountain to pitch the tent. I was feeling good, and passed up a few tent sites because I wanted to get just a little further... then a little further... and because I was focused on looking for sites and trying to remember the words to all the Christmas songs stuck in my head I just kept walking and didn't mind the uphill so much.
And now we're almost at the top!
I don't know my own strength. If I had tried to hike this far on purpose, I may have struggled.
But I am secretly a badass.
Also, Greg got some pictures of a massive bullfrog tadpole at Moxie Bald Lean-to.
I have now hiked past the endpoint of my first attempt four years ago. 
I am mighty.","West branch of the Piscataquis River
",Somewhere close to the top of Pleasant Pond Mountain,"Jun 29, Thu",17.50
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571259,"I hurt this morning, but that was okay! Today was a short mostly downhill day to showers and laundry!
It rained a lot last night, but our tent kept us wonderfully dry. We woke up in a cloud. There was a better tentsite than where we had pitched about five minutes later, but whatever, it worked. We passed some pretty chill NOBOs today- it's always nice when they're friendly and helpful and encouraging rather than the ones who are just grumpy and ready to be done.
The day was all downhill, but it was tricky and muddy and very slippery. I wiped out pretty hard once. Eventually we got to Caratunk, got delicious milkshakes at Caratunk House, then got a ride here to the Sterling Inn. The guy who runs it is super nice, with great hospitality. He sells pasta sides at a reasonable price, too. (As far as I can tell with a limited sample size so far.)
I am finding that due to my overall soreness it is now difficult to sit cross-legged. Or with my legs straight. I have yet to find a way to position my legs that doesn't hurt other than standing. Hopefully a shorter day today and sleeping in a bed will help.
Greg and I talked a lot today about our pace. It's tricky, because while I am clearly capable of some long days, I also hike poorly and miserably if I'm under pressure or discouraged about something... So we're going to mostly aim for low mileage days (so we have plenty of food so Greg doesn't stress about it- that's his big worry) but be capable of pushing farther if the opportunity comes up. There are some pretty big mountains coming up, so that will certainly slow us down regardless.
Most of my toes have skipped blistering and now just have small calluses on the sides. That's okay with me.
Tomorrow is supposed to be another grey day with occasional rain, but hey, it's not raining all the time!","Somewhere close to the top of Pleasant Pond Mountain
","Sterling Inn, Caratunk","Jun 30, Fri",7.20
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571265,"(I'm typing this up in a library, don't have my guidebook with me, and totally forgot to put a mileage number on this entry, so ""4"" may be inaccurate... I'll have to come back and fix it later, and check my other mileages too because I think they got off somewhere else, too.)
We were planning on a long day today, but I was really sleepy after breakfast so I took a nap, then we figured if we took a short day we could have the famous pancake breakfast at Harrison's tomorrow...
A short day is good. It can help my knees feel better, my muscles get stronger, and keep my spirits high. It's been a great day for experiences, too- the canoe across the Kennebec, meeting the guy who runs Harrison's, and now we're here on an absolutely beautiful pond. There was a snake relaxing on a rock, and I saw a loon dive in the water.
I am not going to plan how far we hike tomorrow. Anybody I've worked with knows I love planning things, but I want to see how I do with the plan just being to walk. I'll stop when I'm tired, or it's lateish and there's a good spot.
I wish I'd gotten the name of the guy at Harrison's- it's probably Tim Harrison, based on the sign here. I've been thinking of him as a sort of a hospitality hermit- he clearly loves being out on his own in the middle of nowhere here, but he also really enjoys meeting and offering hospitality to hikers and other groups. He has a great little dog named Charlie.
(Of course I got the dog's name but not the human's...)
I feel like there was more that happened today, but I just don't remember. I might remember later, like how I was thinking today about the very perturbed ground bird that crossed my path before Moxie Bald Mountain.
It really, really is beautiful here.
I will take this occasion of a near-0 day to write out various things I have forgotten.
Gear updates:
Both of our plastic sporks broke in the 100-mile wilderness. We got a long titanium spoon our first day at Shaw's, but I wanted something with tines for my ramen. Lo and behold, when we ran into Sarah and Tony again at Wilson Valley Lean-to, Tony had found a lovely long metal spork previously, and gave it to us! It is perfect.
Greg has tried several times to glue his boots back together to help them make it to Rangeley where he can get new ones. It has only sort of worked.
I found a tent stake in the ground where we camped on Pleasant Pond Mountain, so we have an extra now, if either we or anyone we run into needs it.
I got a new-in-the-packaging Sea to Summit pack cover from the hiker box at Shaw's that is big enough to fit my clunky old pack. It's a bit heavy, but I think I do like having it to keep the fabric of my pack from getting even heavier with water.
I really like cedar trees.
(later)
It's raining pretty hard, and has been for the last two hours or so. I'm really glad we're in the lean-to. Two very nice section hikers are here, and there are some summer camp girls up the hill in tents, but that's it unless we get some late northbounders.
It was raining so hard the entire area in front of the shelter was a puddle, and this is one with pretty good drainage. (Unlike Wilson Valley, where I slipped and fell on my ass in the mud in the middle of the night.)
I played Carcassone with Greg on his tablet. In a shelter. Looking at a pond. In a downpour. It was a bit surreal, and he won.","Sterling Inn, Caratunk
",Pierce Pond Lean-to,"Jul 01, Sat",4
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571270,"A short day today, considering the terrain... Although it was substantially rougher than it would have been if it was dry. We had two fords today, one of which is not considered a ford on the map or in the guidebook, and the other of which does not even make an appearance at all on the map or in the guidebook. It was maybe 2 inches of rain that fell last night, so everything was a flood. 
We passed a particularly nice northbounder in a kilt who, unprovoked, apologized for all negative northbounders. It is always really sad when there are grumpy northbounders, but the positive ones are totally awesome people.
It turns out that the things around here named ""Arnold"" are after Benedict Arnold, who did some sort of daring military journey through the area in 1775.
We stopped early today because I just couldn't get my head with it. Today marked the 4th time I had to ask Greg not to step on bog bridges while I am on them because it shakes them. He just gets momentum going and doesn't notice. 
I also fell really hard on my butt today on a slippery bridge- thank you, external frame backpack, for making me fall backwards rather than forward onto rocks or sideways into a deep swamp!
Stopping early worked out well, though- I washed the sweat out of my hiking clothes, Greg went for a swim in the pond, and we got a lovely fire going with Jon and Eric when they showed up.
I should be able to do more miles tomorrow, with an early start, even with more uphill. More uphill means more views!","Pierce Pond Lean-to

The views off of Little Bigelow were stunning- we could see the rest of the Bigelows rising up ahead of us. That's tomorrow!

","Stratton Motel, Stratton","Jul 04, Tue",10.40
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571276,"First, more on yesterday:
We stayed at the Stratton Motel hostel, which was nice and run by super chill people. We got a ton of snacks and had veggie burgers for dinner at the gas station and chatted with some locals there. It had a really lovely wooden table that really encouraged just talking and chatting with whoever else was around.
Today may seem like a shorter day, but it was really pretty rough. I listened to podcasts for most of it, which was good because the trail coming up the mountain (for 5 miles...) wasn't even very nice. Then we got to the top! And there were just trees! North Crocker Mountain is the second highest peak on the AT in Maine (with Katahdin being the highest) and there was nothing. The southern peak had okay views from a side trail.
I picked up some dehydrated refried beans from the hiker box in Stratton, and we had some for dinner with ""Taco Rice"" rice side and sharp cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling and a complete protein and very tasty. It also helps us use up our cheddar cheese so we can start on the horseradish cheddar we bought in Stratton. I am very excited for more horseradish cheese.
I'm becoming more and more worried about my left hip. Four years ago when I started backpacking, I would occasionally feel a sharp pain in the lower, outer part of my left hip. It's in the little area that would be called ""violin hips"" by people who case about that, but inside. Since then I have sometimes felt that same pain while hiking with my pack. Tightening my hipbelt differently doesn't affect it, although the only thing that makes it go away sometimes is taking my pack off and sitting down. Just stopping moving or just taking my pack off doesn't fix it.
My right hip is completely fine pain-free, so I doubt it's a problem with my pack (although I'll check again that the weight in it is evenly distributed?) It has never happened that I recall while not wearing the pack, but there are several circumstances that correlate with the pack: walking over difficult, uneven terrain with elevation changes, walking more than 5-6 miles in a day, and walking long distances on consecutive days. Hiking in Raleigh was always flat and even, and never for long.
I'll pay attention to how I use my left leg on funky terrain, and maybe take some ibuprofen. The only reason I'm worried now is that it's getting worse- I can still feel it now that I'm sitting in the tent with my pack off, and that is new.","Stratton Motel, Stratton
",Near the South Branch of the Carrabasset River,"Jul 05, Wed",8.40
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571283,"I paid a lot of attention to my hip today. It likes downhill better than uphill, and there is definitely a higher likelihood of my feeling it on rough terrain. The biggest thing I noticed is that when I'm going uphill, I sometimes get lazy with my left trekking pole and use my right hand with my right foot. This is a bad thing and it makes my hip hurt. I need to use my left arm more.
Today had lots of really narrow trail with lots of brush closing in on either side. There was a beautiful couple of miles before Orbeton Stream, though, very open and then alongside a brook. Just some lovely forest.
I've been listening to podcasts when hiking more recently. It keeps me a bit from worrying about whether I'm going fast enough, or wondering where I am now. I'm used to having podcasts or radio on in the background when playing games or whatever, so this really isn't so different.
We haven't seen another SOBO on the trail in 4 days. Just two when we were headed out of Stratton. It's kind of lonely. There is a really nice NOBO flip-flop here, though, and a pair of section hikers. It's nice to have people around.
Greg isn't feeling well this evening, but I think it's probably just his body telling him to chill out a bit. I'm not too worried.
We're in the lean-to tonight, since the bugs aren't too bad... Let's hope they stay that way.","Near the South Branch of the Carrabasset River

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572012,"Today has been absolutely wonderful.
Saddleback was completely stunning. I think it's my favorite so far because of how much hiking was above tree line. I took some pictures, but they completely fail to capture it. It's all about the way it feels to be walking and have sky all around.
I had worried, early in the day, if the Hiker Hut would be a good place to stay. It turns out it is perfect for me right now. There is no electricity or running water or internet or phone signal. There is outstanding hospitality, an outdoor shower by a river, and a lovely private hut for me and Greg. Outstanding hospitality... like, once Greg and I had picked which Hut to stay in, and were putting down our stuff, Steve who runs this place brought over a table and chairs and salsa and chips and an apple and blueberries for us. And when he found out it would be cold tonight, he made sure we had an extra blanket and would be warm enough.

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572014,"Today was wonderfully relaxing. We went to town and hung out at he library for almost the entire 4 hours it was open, uploading pictures and journal entries and charging things. They had a bake sale going on, too, so we got some tasty lemon bars. Then we went to the grocery store and got waaaayyy too much food, and came back here and relaxed. Steve and Cathy made a wonderful dinner. They said earlier that they needed to use up some veggies from their garden, so they'd make a big salad for us for free. That sounded great!
Come dinner time, they had also made rice and beans and corn and mac and cheese and there was pecan pie and blueberry cake... it was amazing! I am so incredibly awed by the hospitality here. And they're just really cool people to talk to- it turns out the Cathy went to Simon's Rock!
We spent a while after dinner just sitting on the porch of the bunk house, Greg playing guitar, me looking ahead in the guidebook and watching the hummingbirds around the feeders and in the garden.
Over dinner, I mentioned that I still didn't really know what I want to do with my life (in the context of what will I do out in California?) and Cathy's response was along the lines of, ""well, you're doing it!""
And that's true. I am doing what I want to do with my life out here, right now. And even if I have no concrete goal overall or overarching ambition, I pretty much do manage to live a life I enjoy. I am so lucky.","Hiker Hut in Rangeley

There was a fantastic view from the Rt. 17 crossing about a mile ago. On the way from there to here we crossed three or four dry riverbeds- this whole area must fill with water if it's been really raining.

When I woke up, I still had no energy, but we pushed a little further to the top of the mountain.
I was in such bad shape Greg was really worried about me, and we talked about getting me checked out by a doctor, for the exhaustion that a zero day didn't help and also my hip, which continues to hurt worse.

There were some cool views from Old Blue Mt. if you're tall or stand on a big rock. It's got lots of little trees up there.
I fell really badly coming down it, though, sliding ten feet down granite on my butt. My shorts miraculously did not tear, but the backs of my thighs are so raw it hurts to sit... So it goes. Scrapes and a mildly bent trekking pole are pretty mild consequences for a slip that far. I'll take it.

Definitely hip bursitis, but if I can rest it enough to get the inflammation down, I have some stretches I can do that should keep it from getting so bad in the future, plus the stuff I was already starting to figure out about using my trekking poles evenly.I'll stay off trail until no later than next weekend, then see how it goes, taking it easy when it hurts and icing on towns. If I can make it out of Maine and through the Whites, it'll act up less and less...As far as the fatigue goes, I'm waiting on bloodwork. My pet theory is now that it was anemia acting up again and a multivitamin that includes iron is just not enough when my diet is pasta sides, ramen, and gummy candy from gas stations.","Coastal ME

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572527,"I'm headed back to the trail this weekend, I just have to somehow not go crazy between now and then. For the past week, I've really wanted to go on a nice long walk to relieve stress, but I can't because I'm supposed to be resting, which is what I'm stressed about. Ugh. We'll be taking at least a short hike tomorrow so I have a chance at not completely losing what little trail legs I had managed to develop.
No conclusion whatsoever from medical testing on the extreme fatigue I was dealing with, so I'll go with the iron deficiency theory. A multivitamin is enough for Greg and presumably most other hikers, and issues like hip bursitis aren't common for people my age... But I've apparently got a single-digit constitution score and just have to accept that and compensate accordingly.
The big change is that when we get back out, we'll have our dog, Zia, with us! We were close to bringing her with us to start with, but figured the complicating factors of dog AND Greg trying to apply for jobs would make towns too difficult. Now Greg has a job, we're past the fords that she would really dislike, and she'll help me remember to take it easy so I don't aggravate my hip again. Taking her with us means some more pack weight, too, and that we can't really sleep in shelters anymore, but she's worth it... And it means she'll stop driving my parents crazy with her endless energy. She'll have a great time jumping around on rocks.
I'm really looking forward to getting back out there.","Coastal ME

Plus, when we got to the shelter, a familiar face was here- Skeeter, now called Disciple. Another SOBO named Danielle is here, too.
We were going to tent, because o want to be considerate about having Zia with us, but they both expressed that they would actually like snuggling with a dog... So we're in the lean-to. They had a fire going, which was lovely. Greg and I had our new fancy rice side of Mexican beans and rice and it was delicious.

",Frye Notch Lean-to,"Jul 23, Sun",10.50
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573388,"I woke up on my own around 5 today, went to the privy and saw a red line of sunrise on the horizon. I dozed and listened to ""Never Quite Free"" until Greg's alarm went off at 5:45. We got ready and got the tent packed up before 7, when we heard the rain might start.
The rain amazingly held off until after we got all the way over Baldpate. I don't have any pictures because of the threat of rain, but the views were incredible. It was really windy, too- almost as much as we had on Whitecap. I was glad we were southbound, since we went up steep exposed rock faces that would have been really painful to go down.
We have really had fantastic experience with weather this trip. Cold rain in the mosquitolands when we didn't want to stop moving anyway, downpour on a near-0, thunderstorms while we were safely inside the Rangeley library... I guess we were overdue for some rough weather, and Old Speck was the perfect location to make sure we felt it.
It started raining while we were taking a break at Baldpate Lean-to, and continued steadily. It wasn't bad at all in Grafton Notch, because we were under lots of trees, there wasn't much wind, and the lower elevation was warmer. The higher we got up Speck, the windier and colder it got. We were in a cloud by the top, and I was working hard to make my hands not go numb, flexing them as often as I could. That only worked for a little while. The downhill off of Speck was completely exposed, granite rock with no solid footholds that was slippery in the rain. Zia was so cold she was whining- there's no good way to tell a dog, ""yes, I know, me too, but there is literally nowhere to stop right now so we have to keep moving.""
The forecast for this shelter was ~50 degrees, so it was probably in the 40s on top, with rain and wind chill... we were all three of us so cold when we got here. And the lean-to was full of sleeping people and it looked like all the tent sites were taken. Greg was thankfully able to find a spot for us to tent while Zia and I huddled under a tarp in a cooking area and I made us hot chocolate. This tent platform is technically for large groups only, but it's at least a third taken up by a large stack of wood under a tarp, so I think we're okay.
We lay in our sleeping bags for a while after changing into dry clothes to try to get warm. It worked enough that Greg was able to go cook dinner while I snuggled with Zia in my sleeping bag to get her warm.
Now we're all okay. Fed, watered, not hypothermic. The weather forecast up here says that with windchill tonight it'll feel like it's in the 20s or 30s... I think the tent should block a lot of that, though.
It sure doesn't feel like July. But today I conquered two mountains, and it all worked out. Zia is snoring.
Danielle and Disciple got here as it was getting dark. I'm happy to see them, but so sorry they came over the mountain in this weather, too.","Frye Notch Lean-to
",Speck Pond Shelter,"Jul 24, Mon",10.40
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573419,"We got a late start this morning. We both (plus Zia!) wanted to sleep in after yesterday.
By the time we left Speck Pond, the sun was trying really hard to shine through the clouds. We made great time for the first mile- less than half an hour. Then we hit Mahoosuc Arm, which was like going down Old Blue except it just kept going and going with all the exposed rocks, still wet and slippery from the rain. Greg had to pick Zia up a lot... and then we hit Mahoosuc Notch. It took us over three hours to go through it. It was fun at first, but got pretty stressful- Zia was just not having it and totally shut down after being picked up over and over again. Greg was so strong to keep carrying her over those crazy rocks. I needed both hands just to not fall, and he used one to carry a 50 pound dog half the time.
I'm really glad to have gone through that for the experience. I don't think Zia is, although she has cheered up a bit since then. Sleep will do her good. The view from the top of Fulling Mill Mountain was a perfect end to today's hike. I shouted in triumph.
I thought all of the platforms here had been taken by Boy Scouts, but it turns out that the many loud, young boys are actually from a summer camp. Our tent is pitched in a sort of funky spot because of it, since I don't want to bother people in the shelter with Zia.
Disciple and Danielle are here, as well as a couple that started just the day after we did! Zia is happy to see her friends.","Speck Pond Shelter

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573421,"I hurt all over. Yesterday, my boots turned against me and started tearing holes in my heels and the top of one of my toes. Now, only one of my toes doesn't have at least one blister or open sore on top of it. I've never had that problem before.
I'm exhausted. The terrain today was difficult, and I'm just drained. Zia's paws are looking a little beat up, but she was overall a little happier today. (No freezing rain, no mile-long rock scramble= happy dog who enjoys hiking.)
Two night ago we had loud Boy Scouts. Last night we had loud campers (turns out it was TWO camps, but the French-speaking one was so quiet I didn't know they were there.) Tonight there are 20-something's playing music through speakers (after 9PM) and loudly singing along.
Negatives aside, the views from Goose Eye were spectacular and I was happy for much of the day. Just so done right now.

Later, around 3 AM:
I'm awake, and there is so much stuff from today I don't want to forget. I just got back from the privy and am proud of my ability to navigate in the dark because it is not close to our tent. 
I am not impressed with the AMC so far. This privy is close to full and the smell permeates a large area, even down to the shelter. There were hardly any blazes on top of Mount Success, even though there were many branching paths and the trail itself was somewhat overgrown. We got lost for a while. They also don't put signs up at the top of mountains, which I had gotten used to seeing in MATC lands, so you have no way of knowing if you're at the top or just at yet another false summit.
The views from Goose Eye Mountain's peaks were truly incredible, even if the trail between them alternated between steep rock face and occasionally sketchy bog bridges. Greg said it rivaled Saddleback for his favorite mountain so far.
We're in New Hampshire!!! Crossing the state line was really exciting. I have hiked the entirety of the AT in Maine.
It hit me, somehow a mile or two before that, when talking to a northbounder, that I'm really going to do this. I'm going to walk to Georgia. That's an enormous undertaking. And I can do it!
My feeling of that has not diminished with my pain and exhaustion, just been obscured. I will rest and heal and push through and continue walking South, over exposed rock, and mud, and roots, and over bald mountain tops and roads, and across rivers and streams, accepting what comes as a part of the experience. I will be a thru-hiker.","Full Goose Shelter

We're taking it easy for a few days for Zia's sake, and also because my new boots won't have arrived in Gorham until Monday, so there's no point in getting to Pinkham Notch before then.
The first few miles today were really easy, but then the mountains went back to normal again. We could see ahead to the rest of the Whites from the top of Moriah, which was cool.
Zia seems overall much happier now that she's had a break for a day.
There is a lovely view of the sunset here, and the caretaker is really nice.

Yeah, it was steep with exposed rock faces and climbing down with hands in parts, but that's nothing we haven't already done. Had she not gone down Speck, or Mahoosuc Arm, or Goose Eye, or even Katahdin? So confusing. Maybe it looked scarier going up?
Golden Waldo picked us up at Pinkham Notch. He's an amazing shuttler who runs out of White Birches. Greg went and got groceries, we ate lots of food, and got caught up on Game of Thrones.
I shared a great moment with a NOBO today. We had just come out of the woods at the gondola area, which was full of tourists in normal clothes and the sound of machinery from the gondola. A NOBO muttered as he passed me, ""this is so weird..."" and I emphatically agreed. It's nice to share little moments or experiences like that with people.

We talked about the mountains and hurricanes, since he lives in Florida the rest of the year.
The first few miles today were pretty gentle, although I definitely felt how heavy my pack was with food. It took us a while to get all the way up Madison, though- today introduced a new type of terrain. Above treeline, it was all small to medium sized rocks that were often loose or wobbly. I also really couldn't see the cairns or blazes ahead since the sun was straight ahead also. We made it, though, and the views were spectacular, although the setting sun made pictures really not work.
Three other hikers we know we're at the Hut, including one we haven't seen since the 100-mile Wilderness! That was pretty cool. We wanted to just camp in one of the stealth sites along this side trail rather than have to come all the way down to the campsite, but the only spot big enough for our tent (and it was big enough to fit two of our tent...) had a single-person tent pitched right in the middle of it, so we had to keep walking. It'll be a long .6 miles back up tomorrow morning, but it's the only option for SOBOs with a dog unless we were to try try hiking up Madison and then the following 12 miles all in one day.

I really wish I could have properly enjoyed today, but I was just so stressed out. About 3 miles in, Zia just decided she was done and stopped moving. We had no warning- no limping or slowing down or hesitancy to get up in the morning. She just decided she was done, and we had to spend lots of effort coaxing her forward or carrying her the rest of the day. My dad can come out and get her at Crawford Notch when we get there.
When we got to Lake of the Clouds, I was prepared to grovel for them to make an exception and let Zia stay here, but it turns out dogs are allowed in the hiker dungeon anyway! No grovelling required. So we're staying here tonight in the tiny little emergency shelter/dungeon. It's accurately named, but much nicer because there are two other southbounders for excellent company. And you can't beat the view of Mt. Washington from the door. 
I'm sitting on a rock right now outside, looking at the sunset and the many clouds drifting by over Washington. There's a lovely little brook and I can hear at least one frog even at this elevation... never mind, the cloud arrived. I am now in a cloud.
Earlier when we were making dinner, a voice called downward and offered us peach cobbler. High-elevation trail magic! It was delicious and made us all very happy.

Technically we yellow-blazed the 0.3 mile road walk up to the parking area in Crawford Notch... I think that's fair after we walked an extra mile. Plus, I have a ton of bonus miles- I consider the extra miles walked to shelters, campsites, and views as extra distance that means I don't feel bad about skipping a short road walk today, or if I get picked up/dropped off opposite sides of a street crossing or whatever.

There were a ton of blueberries along the trail, too. Most of the bushes we pass are totally picked over, but they weren't today. Maybe everybody else just speeds past and misses them?
It started raining just before we hit Zealand Falls Hut, so it was great to be able to stop in and get some hot soup and leftover blueberry pancakes. We hung out there for about an hour with another southbound couple, trying to let the weather ease up a bit.
It didn't, so we headed out in the rain. The uphill for Mt. Guyot was really not so bad, even in the rain. Lots of rocks, but nothing too crazy. The only frustrating part was not really knowing where we were, or how far we had gone. Everything looks sort of similar in the wind and rain, and there were few signs with mileage of how far we'd come or how far we had left to go.
The day passed in a blur, but we made good time- 5 hours to do the 6.9 miles with elevation change, rocks, and lots of rain. By he time we got to the Hut, we were soaked through, and had been for a while. The other SOBO couple arrived around the same time, and graciously let us take the last two work-for-stay spots while they hiked on. I could have pushed on to Garfield Ridge shelter, but it's really nice to not have to.
I'm warm and dry, and hopefully my nasty wet clothes will dry out some overnight once the lights are off and I can spread them out some. This hut has a lovely croo- they let us eat the leftovers just after dinner, rather than having us wait until lights out like the made the WFS folks do at Lake of the Clouds. The food was really good, too, particularly the lentil soup and bread.
We're doing our work after breakfast tomorrow morning, so we'll get a later start, but that's okay.
I may wish it wasn't so expensive to do anything in the Whites, but I can kind of see why it is the way it is.

We didn't get a sunrise view this morning because we were in a cloud, but I stayed warm the whole night even with my sleeping bag being damp with dew and cloud.
We walked three miles downhill to get to the road, and as soon as we tried hitching the first car pulled over for us- a mom with two kids. We got groceries, picked up aqua Mira and a new pocket knife for Greg at the outfitters, and got a great burrito lunch. At the outfitters I also got orthotic inserts for my boots- I've noticed that my left foot rolls inward sometimes and that seems pretty connected to my hip pain. Arch support seems like it might help. We got a ride back to the trail after less than five minutes of trying to hitch- Vermonters are lovely people.
The afternoon was pretty uneventful from there, other than a brief emotional breakdown when the new insoles were making my toes fall asleep and I despaired at why everything has to be so painful. I loosened my laces, though, and was okay from there, and only had to take breaks every 3-4 miles because my hip hurt too badly to keep walking rather than every 1-2 miles, so the insoles might be helping.

Tonight at the shelter we had a campfire and I sat around talking with Mama Duck, some section hikers, and some NOBOs for a while. I now have a trail name- Phoenix, for my love of fire (and bringing it back from ashes...) and personally because this hike sort of came out of my past failures.

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576848,"My pack feels so heavy! Greg is on his way to Boston for a conference, so I'm carrying all the stuff he usually does, most notably the tent.
We spent so long at the fantastic Papa Johns in North Adams that by the time I started up Greylock, I knew I would have to night hike. It felt like the steepest, rockiest climb since New Hampshire, but maybe that was just the weight of the tent on my back. It was grey and cloudy all day, and by the time I got to the top all I could see were clouds.
Then things got creepy in several different ways. I went into Bascom Lodge to ask if I could get water, and there was no one there. It's a beautiful old building, and there were signs for reception and a gift shop area with bare shelves... and no one at all. That was just creepy like a set from Scooby-Doo, though- beautiful old lodge in the clouds. I'm sure there were staff there, just off doing other things. I got water and left, ignoring the tent set up outside- same as mine, but just... pitched empty. Nothing in it or nearby. It added to the cool-creepy atmosphere. (Made less creepy by the one tourist family up there in the clouds all coming in to use the bathrooms at the lodge.)
Then there was evening-twilight-forest creepy, which is nice. Clouds blowing through the trees, occasional sunset-colored glimpses through the trees. Beautiful, but eerily quiet.
And then there was alarm-bells sounding in my head creepy. About a mile and a half before the shelter, at least a quarter mile from any road or trail junction, there was a man standing in the woods. He was facing away and took a few steps down the trail as I approached before stepping aside. He was wearing jeans and had no backpack. He avoided facing me, so I couldn't see his face. It was getting very dark- about an hour to pitch black, half an hour until definitely needing a headlamp. And he was just standing there. The whole thing felt very off, even after he said, ""hi.""
I rushed to the shelter, feeling freaked out enough to not want to stop even to take my headlamp out, so I had to use my phone's flashlight for the last bit.
When I got to the shelter, though, I found a group of lady section hikers who had a fire going and made room for me in the shelter. I feel safe now.","Sherman Brook Campsite

I'm the only one camping here at the church tonight. In the big tent that Greg and I usually share. I have a luxurious amount of space.
I stopped in the local general store to get denatured alcohol for my stove. It looks like it belongs several decades back, which was so strange. Not much selection, but I'm glad I went in. I got some more junk food at the gas station, plus they had my favorite Gatorade- cucumber lime. It's hard to find and I love it.
While I was making dinner, a local kid biked over and started chatting. He goes by Snowflake and carries a trail register with him. Meeting backpackers is an odd hobby for a fifth grader, but he seems nice. He likes to put on a Russian accent. At one point he recognized a guy that was biking past as the school superintendent, so he shouted hi and the superintendent came over to chat. I learned a lot about fixed gear bikes. Then Snowflake's mom came by to check on him and make sure he wasn't bothering anyone, so he was able to show me a good picture of their dog that she had. The dog is only 7 months old and absolutely adorable.
There are comments on Guthook about Snowflake somehow being responsible for hikers not being allowed to sleep inside anymore, and he did keep an eye out for the church manager who apparently runs him off sometimes, but I talked to the guy who was locking up tonight and he said the reason hikers can't sleep inside is because it's a violation of fire codes...

Can I push through the cold rains and snows and actual mountains again without someone to reassure me that I don't suck at everything like I get convinced I do sometimes?I think I can, Greg thinks I can. My parents probably expect me to give up and go out to California. No one else cares.I have always lacked self-esteem and confidence. It's why I hide my personality for a long time after meeting people for fear of judgment. It's why I fail at things. Now, to do this, I just need to find that confidence somewhere in myself.

I can deal with this. I just wish that when I had seen a doctor several hundred miles ago he had been at least a little bit interested in the cause of my hip bursitis.

The trail went within a mile or so of my old summer camp, so I stopped in to visit with my old friend Paul who works there. It was strange being somewhere that hasn't changed in the nine years since I last saw it. I got to eat camp food for dinner, with vegetables and bread and rice. There were brownies for dessert, and I got two extra because they would have thrown them out otherwise. I am very much against food waste, and very much for brownies.
It was almost a shame that I got tap water because the spring on the way down to the camp was the nicest water source I've seen in ages. It has been so dry!
I packed out my water and found a nice flat spot for my tent about a mile down the trail. I got my bear bag up and tent pitched before dark! Go me!","Gren Anderson Shelter

I got lunch at the Mohican Outdoor Center, which was good.
My feet hurt like hell. The trail was pretty rocky, and then there was a long roadwalk along I-80. (Which was mildly terrifying, by the way. The bridge over the Delaware shook when trucks went past.) Hopefully the outfitter tomorrow will have insoles that will solve my hip problems and maybe help my feet.

I like to think that I have a good tolerance for bugs, spiders, and other creepy crawlies. When I put my face down on a millipede the other night, I just made a face and flicked it off. My tolerance was greatly tested today. I saw no other people for about 8 miles between the shelter outside of town and Bake Oven Knob, and clearly no one had gone that way but me, because there were tons of spiderwebs on the trail, high and low. My trekking poles had a visible sheen of webs in them, as did the top of my pack and my hat. I can still pick strands out of my hair.
Despite this seemingly-high spider population, I was surrounded by a large cloud of gnats and flies all day long. Swallowing a fly or getting a gnat stuck in my eye are normal parts of the day, but today seven gnats lodged themselves in my eyes, I swallowed two, and had another one go up my nose. None of that was as bad as the buzzing, though. The buzzing is what was really getting to me.
I was having this really buggy day, and then decided to take a break at Bake Oven Knob shelter. I picked up the register, opened it, and there were a dozen critters on the page, alive, that if they weren't stink bugs they had the same body type. Then I noticed that there were many of that bug, crawling on the logs of the shelter and occasionally flying through the air with a buzzing noise that seemed as loud as a small aircraft. They either weren't very good at flying or didn't care where they were going, though, since they repeatedly flew into me and bounced off. I checked into the register then decided to take my break somewhere else. There must have been hundreds of them.
This spot is less buggy, though, and I'm in my tent. The spring here is flowing well, clear and cool. And tomorrow should be significantly cooler than it has been in a while!","Palmerton, PA

Around noon, I finally headed out of town and learned the gravity of the mistake I made yesterday: I resupplied before eating, and therefore bought a ton of food. I could feel on the way up the hill to Loudon Heights that my pack was the heaviest it has been in a long time. Oof.
I made it up, though, met some cool local day hikers, and made good enough time that my mileage today is really good for just a half day.

This shelter has an amazing river running in front of it that reminds me of Maine. It has pools so deep I could swim if it was warmer out.
There was a bunch of firewood that was easy to gather here, too, so I was able to get a nice fire going. There is a nice couple from D.C. here that gave me some of their coconut beans and rice mountain house. There are two guys from nearby who helped cut up more firewood.

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580210,"I was moving slowly today, but I hauled myself ~3000 feet up the Priest, confessed my sins in the register there, and got here well before dark. This morning was sunny, but as the day went on the clouds got darker and the wind picked up in a major way. I was chilly when I got here, and the wind blows straight into the shelter. I've got my stuff set up on the side where there is a bit less of a draft and the rain later is less likely to blow in.
And it will rain, and it will be very cold tomorrow. Tomorrow night the rain will stop, but it will get to the 30s even in the valley- my destination. Whenever people ask if I'm worried about the cold and snow, I tell them I'm not worried about snow. I'm worried about the day it is 40 degrees and raining- tomorrow is that day, with 20 mile an hour winds. I know I can handle this, and if I'm really miserable there are motels in Buena Vista. I'm still nervous, though, but a little excited. This is a challenge to overcome. 
It very well may be uncomfortable, but that's okay. I will ask for my top base layer and warm hat to be mailed soon, and I'll pick up some new long underwear for camp so I can hike in my current ones in the future.
For now, I am the only one in the shelter. I made myself hot chocolate (I'm a bad vegetarian and got the kind with mini marshmallows) and I'm listening to the Avett Brothers because Jupiter wrote the lyrics to ""I and Love and You"" in the register and now it's stuck in my head. I'm not a huge Avett Brothers fan, but their song ""Sanguine"" popped up on Pandora for me years ago and it was exactly what I needed at the time.

It was so foggy visibility was only about 10 feet anyway. I passed by Tinker Cliffs and saw the inside of a cloud up close. Shortly after the main outcropping, though, the clouds split open up ahead. It was not enough to see the valley, but there was a separation between the low, rolling clouds and the high, puffy clouds with blue sky in the middle. Hiking farther for the day was such a good thing, if only for that moment of beauty. The sun even shined through briefly- an incredible respite in a grey, damp, rainy day.
It gets dark so early now! I hiked the last mile and a half in the dark, which was tricky with the dense fog. I couldn't keep my headlamp on my head or the fog would just reflect the light back into my eyes, so I held it in my hand. Might as well have been a flashlight. I might have missed the turn for the shelter if I hadn't smelled woodsmoke and seen a small campfire and several headlamps.

Plus, this shelter has a register that shows people stay here all the time. The last shelter, four miles ago, did not have a register, which is unfortunate because I really wanted to express what I thought of the previous 8 or so miles of trail. On the way up the mountain, the trail followed a water path, deeply cut into the ground, full of rocks, steep, and an absolute mess. Once on the ridgeline, the trail was extremely rocky, and with the wet leaves and wet rocks I spent several hours swearing loudly.
It might not have been so bad if it hadn't been wet and foggy all day again. It never really rained, which is good, or that trail would have been a river, but it misted and visibility was extremely low. I was tempted to stop at the last shelter, but I really want to get to Pearisburg tomorrow because it's supposed to be really cold tomorrow night, and that's where I ordered a sleeping bag liner and new long underwear to.
I made it here, though, with Calvin and Hobbes, and I even put in the effort after dinner to get a fire going in the shelter's (indoor) fireplace. It was a challenge with almost everything being wet (although Calvin found some great dry vines hanging on the shelter) but with persistence and burning lots of toilet paper as a fire starter it made my day a lot better.

The major negative today is that I somehow left my smart water bottle at the hostel, and so my only water vessel is my nalgene. I can cope, it's just inconvenient to only have one liter of water capacity.
I have not eaten instant mashed potatoes on this trip because I've eaten them on previous trips and do not enjoy shoveling mush into my face for sustenance. The store in Roan Mountain didn't have Knorr sides, though, which are my go-to dinner, so I picked up an Idahoan cheddar broccoli potato soup, figuring it might be better than just potatoes. It called for FOUR cups of water, which, due to my current water bottle situation, meant I carried my cookpot down to the spring and tried really hard not to spill it on the way back up. This soup is amazing and totally worth it. It is also just such a great feeling to be eating hot soup in a building with four walls and a door and listening to the wind and rain outside.

Former SOBO thrus DR and Baby Blue did trail magic when I was at Trapper John shelter in Vermont, and I ran into them again today! They had come down for a long weekend to hang out with and slackpack the Family, and I saw them at the road they were dropping the Family off at. They had extra potato chips and watermelon and pineapple. It was amazing.
I may be somewhat immature, because I thought it was really funny that today's big mountain was called ""Big Butt."" The sign for the ""Big Butt Bypass"" made me laugh. Near the top there was a stone where the ashes of a thru hiker from the 60s had been scattered. I was trying to figure out why there- there are more beautiful mountains, but maybe the relative obscurity of this one was important for his family's privacy... or maybe this guy just liked Big Butts. The trail turned west, and with that thought I walked giggling into the sunset.

Emotionally, I felt a lot better once I got walking, and I could even feel my feet in my frozen boots after a mile or two. I might skip the Smokies and come back after Springer. Hopefully there won't be a foot of snow on the ground by then.
I saw lots more coyote tracks today- more than deer.
This shelter is so much nice than the last one. It actually keeps the wind out!
It is too cold to write much. My fingers go numb so fast.

If I don't find anyone to tackle the smokies with OR the weather doesn't clear up, I will skip around and do them later, around Christmas, or if more snow like this comes in then I'll have to do them in the spring and Greg can come along. I just don't have the gear for extended periods like this. I can do cold, I can do some snow. I can't do snow above my boots and temperatures not getting above freezing for days in a row.
I'm learning how to do this. I want waterproof gaiters. Or snow pants. Or both.
Is there a lot of snow like this on the PCT?
I was miserable this morning, but then I started walking and everything was okay. I need to remember that for tomorrow. And tomorrow will be even warmer! Walking makes me happy, even if I don't know that it will at the time.
Seriously though, this hot nalgene is magical. 
I've been carrying some hot hands since Damascus and treating them like a powerful potion or scroll in a video game- never using them ""in case I need them later."" Dumbass, you can buy more later. Use them tomorrow morning and be happy enough to push to Standing Bear.
It is six and dark out. Only 11 days until the days start to get longer! Or maybe 12. I have no idea.
I just heard noise and it was a mouse in my pack where it was hanging on pegs on the wall. I moved my pack to a mouse trapeze where it will be safer from mice but more likely to fall down and startle me in the middle of the night if there's a breeze. There isn't even anything in there that a mouse would want, but I'd rather it didn't poop in there or chew on the straps or anything.I also gave the mouse my standard speech about how I'm totally fine with sharing the shelter with it, but if it messes with my stuff I will MURDER IT WITH MY SHOE. I added on that I know several coyotes and would happily feed it to them. The mouse doesn't have to know I was lying about that last part.
I need to boil water in a nalgene every night. It takes this whole thing from being a sufficient temperature for sleep to being truly cozy. This whole adventure is mental for me, and being cold all the time is demoralizing. Being cozy is a morale boost.

The trail was either clear of snow and lovely to walk on or still snow covered with lots of icy footprints. I slipped a few times, but icy footprints are easier than walking in snow and much less cold for my ankles. Plus, it means there are people around. The total lack of footprints (except for the summit of Max Patch) made my snow hiking really lonely- breaking trail three days in a row was a very physical reminder of being totally alone. Just me and the coyotes and that one bear.
I've been really tired lately, and I don't entirely know why. Some of it is surely physical, from the ice and snow, but I know some of it is mental and emotional, too. I miss Greg. I have stressful stuff on my mind. It's hard to not feel like skipping the Smokies is failing, even though I plan to do them right after Springer as long as the weather cooperates. I joked to Greg a while back that I'll probably get to Springer and a decently-loud voice in my head will still say, ""Walk from Maine to Georgia? You? That's ridiculous. You couldn't do that."" but it's not totally a joke, and not having done the Smokies when I get to Springer will just make that thought louder. I hope that when I stand on Shuckstack or Cammerer I can wrestle that demon and tell it to shut the (swearing redacted now that I know middle schoolers are reading my journal) up. I just need to try to tune out the doubts until then.
I'm just so tired.
The Dam was beautiful this morning, and there were great views through the trees all day. In a few places there was a clear, visible line of where the sun hits (dry ground) and where the sun does not hit, or doesn't hit for long (snow and ice.)

I only fell badly once, but had to pay a lot of attention to what I did with my feet and the way I carried myself so that if I did fall it would be on my butt on the trail rather than sliding down the mountain on my leg at a funny angle.

(I did remember to type an entry in my phone.)

Got a late start. A guy from a group doing Wilderness First Responder training at the NOC gave me an apple!The forecast for today was partly sunny, but that never really happened. It was grey and windy until sunset.The big thing today was dogs! After seeing blood spots on the snow of the trail for a few miles, I came upon a pair of hounds that had made a nest in the leaves by the trail. One was super playful and friendly, although really, really skinny. The other was clearly the source of the blood drops- cuts on two of its feet and ankles and it was favoring one of its back legs, too. They were clearly hunting dogs- they had what looked like radio collars. The procedure everyone has heard of out here for if you find hunting hounds while hiking, is you leave them alone because their people are around someplace tracking them. But this one was hurt, and shivering, and lying on the side of the trail rather than hunting... I couldn't just leave her. I called the phone numbers on their collars until somebody picked up. I said I could get the dogs to follow me down to Burningtown Gap, and he said he'd meet me there to get the dogs. The hurt one (Abby) was reluctant to move until I attached my bear bag line to her collar and tugged and encouraged her a little, but she came along pretty well after that. Once she got moving and warmed up a little she kept up with me just fine. Her extremely skinny but happy friend (Bandit Buck, according to his collar) ran ahead, and behind, and found sticks in the snow... I could see all his ribs, but I didn't worry too much after I saw his behavior. He was happy. A SOBO called Boiling Frog caught up and helped me keep an eye on them.I was worried about the dogs- the locals around here don't always have a ton of money, and dogs are seen as tools more than pets, and there are people that would take their injured dog and kill it rather than get medical treatment. When I met the guys who came to get the dogs at the Gap, though, they seemed glad to see the dogs and asked if I wanted any money for bringing them on down. I said I just wanted the dogs to be okay, and they said they'd take them home and get them a meal and a warm bed... so at the very least they knew the right thing to say to make me not worry. At that point I was so, so cold I really didn't want to hang around and chat too much anyway. I'd had to take my hands out of my gloves to make the phone calls when I found the dogs, and my hands had never really gotten warm again. I had sweated in my gloves earlier in the day, and when I was walking with the dogs I kept having to keep one hand, gloveless, in my armpit while the other held the bear line and my trekking poles, then switching hands because even in my gloves the hand holding things wasn't staying warm... in Burningtown Gap I got my hot hands out that I'd been saving for later since Damascus and put them in my gloves. By the time Boiling Frog and I got hiking again, it hurt for my fingers to warm back up. Once I had my hands back to a normal temperature, the hand warmers were amazingly comfortable and Boiling Frog and I hiked the last three and a half miles to the shelter together quickly enough to stay warm.There are people here! Three guys out for the weekend who got a fire going. It's so nice to have fire and company, especially in the cold. My water bottle was starting to freeze by the time we got here, not long after sunset. It has to have been in the 20s for it to freeze while jostling in my pack.The sun did finally come out for sunset, though, and there were some great colors in the sky. It felt good to get a solid day of hiking in, even with snow and elevation gain.

He said he couldn't take us the whole way because he had to get to church, but actually called a friend of his who said he could take us. Wow. His friend (trail name Zephyr) had finished section hiking the whole trail a few years ago and is working on an ebook about it- it'll be called ""One Step at a Time"" I think. It was just such an incredible act of kindness for the first guy and Zephyr to both go totally out of their way to help us. That is trail magic.
I got hiking about &:45 and made pretty good time. The trail was mostly well graded, gently going over low hills. The forecast called for ""mostly cloudy,"" so of course the sun shined for hours.

I got going before sunrise at 7 AM, and the sunrise was gorgeous to watch as I was hiking. Most of the day was sunny and really warm- I've clearly forgotten how to drink water in appropriate amounts when it's warm and I'm sweating a lot. I was out of water for a good three miles by the time I got to Tray Mountain Shelter, and when I got water and it was treated I drank well over half a liter right away.
It was on the way to get water at the Tray Mountain Shelter that I realized my shirt was on backwards. Since I didn't change last night, that means my shirt had been backwards for a full day and a half. Oops.
The top of Tray Mountain was really pretty, with rocky outcrops and ferns and that ground plant I've been seeing with leaves that range in color from green to maroon.
I had to turn on my headlamp when I was about three miles out from the shelter. Just before I hit the road at Unicoi Gap, I heard a rustling in the leaves to my left. There were two sets of eyes there, and the animals weren't a uniform color- patches of light and dark. They weren't shaped like hounds, though, although they were roughly dog sized. Maybe it was some lost non-hound dogs? They didn't respond at all when I yelled at them. The idea of ""wild boar"" drifted through my head as I rushed across the road. Probably dogs.
It started to rain as I climbed Blue Mountain, and by the time I got to the shelter I was soaked and exhausted. There are some really nice section hikers here who made hot chocolate for me and Boiling Frog, and who also set up a tarp over the privy because it has no roof. I am very grateful.
It's only supposed to be in the 50s tonight! That's ridiculous.

I may not be totally done yet, but it was really emotional to hit the top of that mountain that has been my goal for so long. I stared at the plaque and cried for a little while. I walked here. From Maine. It doesn't totally compute when I think about it.
My whole life that I can remember, my default view of myself has been that I am the least good, the least skilled, the least worthy, the least worthwhile. But I walked here from Maine. I walked here from Maine and I made friends who thought of me when they summited yesterday. I walked here from Maine, solo for over half of the way. I walked here from Maine and I loved it.
I've been crying a lot. I think I broke something in my brain, but it was something that wasn't right and needed to be broken.
Bring it on, Smokies. I am strong.
Boiling Frog and I hung out at the summit for a while, in the fog and  mist and drizzling rain, chatting with day and section hikers. One couple, day hikers, got engaged. It was a very happy place.
The Approach Trail was mostly boring, as I knew it would be. All the rain made the waterfall absolutely incredible, though. A dad and his two young boys asked us questions about thru-hiking, and the kids were totally awestruck and thought it was super cool that we had walked here from Maine. Maybe they'll thru-hike someday.

I feel kind of bad because I'm so exhausted I wasn't able to talk very much with her. I just did a lot of staring into space.
Still, I managed to coordinate getting to the airport at the end of my hike, and if the road at Newfound Gap is open on Christmas, I can come spend Christmas with Red Hat.
It would probably take a minor miracle for the road to be clear, though. Now that I'm headed back to the Smokies, the forecast is for an inch of two of snow for a white Christmas, then high winds with windchill in the negatives during the day.

I couldn't stop smiling and I chatted with a really nice day hiker named Kelly who had the same trekking poles as I do.
There were still some clouds at my level and above me, but the early afternoon was mostly sunny. I decided not to go out to the Mt. Cammerer fire tower, partly because I didn't know if it would be in clouds or not but mostly because I'm really tired of night hiking and I knew I was already pushing it in terms of getting to the shelter on time.
The Smokies are beautiful. I climbed into high pine forests, dense and mossy. From Mt. Guyot I could see the low clouds extending to the horizon. There is nothing at all beyond these mountain-islands in the vast cloud ocean, and I alone stand on these islands. (As far as I can tell, at least- I saw no one after Kelly.)
I made it to the shelter just before dark. This shelter has a good tarp that is keeping the wind mostly out so far, although it has only just really started to pick up.

I didn't take as many pictures as I wanted, but if I had I would have pictures of everything. The ice on the trees and the snow and the views.
The wind was bitterly cold, but sometimes the mountain kept it off of me, and the sun shined through the clouds sometimes enough to provide a little warmth.

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581671,"I slept in this morning and didn't get going until 10- that's okay, though. I have plenty of time.
Today was partly sunny and beautiful. There were lots of treacherous ice sheets, but also plenty of easy walking. The way up Clingman's Dome was all dense pine forests, but on the way down it was a somewhat more open ridgeline and the golden light of the late afternoon sun shined onto the trees and snow. I'm going to miss this, even with the cold.
I got a nice fire going in the fireplace at this shelter. I though it wasn't throwing off a lot of heat since all the wood is damp or green or both, but after going out to hang my food and coming back it was clear that the shelter is at least a bit warmer than outside. Plus, the fire helps thaw an accidentally-frozen smartwater bottle that I have been carrying as a useless brick for the last day and a half, and it can get some of the moisture out of my shoes so they freeze less badly overnight.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581673,"Too cold to write again. My hands get cold so easily. Cooking was a matter of taking gloves off to do something quickly then having to shove my hands in my armpits to warm them up, then being able to put my gloves back on, then I would have to do something with bare hands again and the process would repeat... I got myself a fancy Backpacker's Pantry dinner for my last night. It was spaghetti with sauce, and it was delicious. The noodles were spirals rather than spaghetti, but that's probably for the best since my spork would have been awkward for actual spaghetti.
I thought it was warm enough to carry water today, but then the trail was mostly on the windy side of the mountain and I had to break through ice on the top of my nalgene any time I wanted a drink, and that's after having to thaw the lid enough to open it. Also, I couldn't get any drops out of part A of my aqua mira today, so I just decided to be picky about water sources. I didn't think aqua mira froze, and I thought I'd used it in colder temperatures than this, but maybe it got some water in it or something.
The day hiker I ran into on Christmas Eve told me Rocky Top was her favorite view in the park and I was really looking forward to it, but just when I got up to the top of Thunderhead a hazy cloud came in around me and I couldn't see a thing. Oh well. More reasons to come back and do more hiking later!
By the end of the day tomorrow, I will be a thru hiker. It hasn't hit me yet. Most of my mental energy is focused on figuring out how to arrange my belongings for optimal warmth. A ridgerest is not really sufficient for comfort in these temperatures, so my hiking clothes are under it, as is an emergency blanket, and I've got my puffy jacket wrapped around my waist. In this cold, I sleep with a lot of things and turning over or moving is complicated- move puffy without getting tangled, don't lie down on top of nalgene, phone, battery pack, headlamp, or gloves that I'm hoping with be less damp in the morning if I sleep with them. Only the tiniest hole is open at the top of the bag to breathe through, so I have to try to line my face up exactly. Staying warm is work.
I don't want this to end, but it'll be nice to not have my nose running constantly.
The moon is beautiful when it's visible tonight, but when I went out to hang up my food bag a cloud had come in again and ice crystals like snow were in the air. It wasn't snowing, and I don't think it was blowing off the ground. I think the cloud was just partly frozen. It's cold up here for real. Fontana tomorrow.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581674,"I slept in this morning and got a late start. The day was clear and sunny and probably slightly above freezing- perfect. The trail was easy and I had no trouble with the few small uphills early in the day. I took a lot of breaks, just looking around and taking it all in. I have to leave this now.
Shuckstack fire tower was incredible. What a perfect final ""summit.""
I ran into a backpacking group and their leader gave me a snickers. I have a ton of food still, (2000 miles and I never did figure out how to only get enough for a few days...) but I was out of snickers, so it was pretty great.
I have thruhiked the Appalachian Trail.
The vending machine at the visitor's center here broke my heart. I pushed the button for a coke and it gave me a diet coke. So it goes.
I did it. I hiked all 2186.8 miles.
The shower here is amazing and hot and has great water pressure. I didn't wash my hair because I don't want to deal with wet/frozen hair in my sleeping bag. I'll wash it tomorrow.
There is a nice couple here who had a great fire going. All the stars are out and the moon is bright enough I don't need my headlamp to walk around.
For this journal, I'll write a few more entries. I want to go back and look at my goals and see how I did with them. I'll post my gear, unorthodox and mismatched as it is. I'll finally get around to uploading pictures and attaching them to entries.
For now, sleep. My last night in a shelter. Life is about to get a lot more complicated. For the last six months I have woken up in the morning and walked. I am going to miss this so much.","Russell Field Shelter

Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582127,"I've added a bunch of pictures and almost every entry should have a picture with it now! I mostly just uploaded one per day, but sometimes there are more if you check the photos page.

Over the course of my hike, I grew an incredible amount as a person. I found strength I didn't know I had and overcame my worst demons of self-doubt.
Now I just have to figure out how to apply that to non-trail life. How does the persistence toward a goal of postholing for miles in the snow translate to searching for a job that means something to me? How does my confidence at the summit of a mountain apply to my self-consciousness when trying to figure out what to wear out to dinner or to an interview that won't look terrible? (It doesn't help that none of my old clothes fit me well anymore.)
It's hard out here in civilization. It's hard to hang onto the person I became on my hike. I know I can do it- I can learn the skills needed to overcome any situation- but the difficulty makes me miss the trail even more. I miss the simplicity of waking up and walking. I miss the earned views at the tops of mountains. I miss the sense of wonder at a river when I realize it's the most water in one place I've seen in days or weeks, and the joy of just watching the ripples as it moves. I miss seeing hemlocks in the fog and finding a new appreciation for them as the only things that aren't grey. I miss being physically and mentally exhausted and satisfied at the end of a long day. I miss the easy camraderie of trail life. I can make friends at a shelter, but I'm not sure yet how to do that in the real world when being the same place as a person doesn't necessarily mean you have all that much in common.
I am so glad all these things are hard, because it means I had an amazing experience. Those are all things I took for granted before. I've always been self-conscious about my clothing, but now I know that that doesn't have to be a part of me because I wasn't when I was hiking. I've always had trouble finishing things I set out to do, but now I know that that doesn't have to be a part of me because I walked from Maine to Georgia.
I wouldn't change anything.
I'm going to apply for a permit to hike the PCT this year when they're available Wednesday- I think I can make it work financially, but whether I go depends on personal and family concerns, but I'd rather have a permit and then give it up later than miss out. If I go, I need to make sure it's rooted in my love of hiking and a desire to do that rather than just running away from the real world.",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Mon",0
