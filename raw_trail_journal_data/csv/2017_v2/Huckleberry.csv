Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553052,"For years, I've been thinking of this trip. Now it's becoming real. This is my first entry in using this site to journal my adventure. Since January 1st, I have been sorting through my camping cabinet, to find the necessary equipment to make this trip. My basement has become a disaster zone, but things are coming together. Decisions on what stove to use, and what clothes to wear when starting out are constantly on my mind. How will the temperatures be in that first week in March? Will I need crampons? It's almost overwhelming. And also, I need to try to get in shape, although, they say you can never really get in shape till you've hiked a few weeks. We'll see. Until tomorrow....",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sat",0
Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553078,"I mentioned yesterday that my wife was behind me on this endeavor. I also would like to say that my two kids and spouses are also supporting me. They also are thinking of coming down sometime to join and hike with me. Jenny and I have hiked the length of Isle Royal, and she's hiked the section from Springer to Unicoi Gap as a section hike. Jon and his two boys, (Nathan 12 and Ben 10), will come out this summer and walk with me for a section as well. Getting excited, but nervous.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553081,"As I sit here watching the playoff games, and waiting for the Packers to play at 3:30 today, I wonder how much snow there is on the Appalachian Trail. My thoughts tend to be more on the trail than watching the playoff games. As I sort out my gear for my pack I will try to keep the weight down to 32 pounds or less. Tomorrow I will start sorting my food resupplies for along the trail. It's complicated because I also have to pack for Chris when she comes down to resupply approximately about every 4 to 6 weeks. The plan would be to bring supplies each time she comes down, and also she would hike a section with me before going home. My first resupply, from Chris, will be at Fontana Dam then we will hike the Smokies together. Approximately 90 miles in 10 days, before she heads home.

Today Chris and I, as well as a couple of buddies, walked 2 miles with my pack. The pack weighs 22 lbs, but I left quite a few items at home. I prefer to practice hike with about 20 pounds for a week and up the weight after a week. Will try to walk everyday this week, at about 2 miles a day to build up my stamina.","

Seems to take a while to get back to a normal state. Beyond that, the food for my first 4 resupplies is set and my gear for the trip has been finalized.

Good for kids but bad for me, as I would like warmer weather to start melting this white wonderland so spring can start early and I can get outside to start real hiking. I usually love winter, but now that I'm preparing for my hike, I find I'm a little impatient with the weather. 7 weeks before I depart from Wisconsin to Georgia, and warmer climate. getting excited.","

Now that I have a normal heart beat, I think I can do a little journaling.           I need to get back to walking tomorrow. I will carry my pack with 20 pounds in it. I was hoping I'd be up to 25 pounds by now, but due to a bad cold I had all last week, I had to cut back to just walking without the pack. Eager to get back to it. At least all my gear has been decided, and the same for my food for the first 6 weeks or more. The only thing I still have to put together will be the snacks. That will happen this week.","

First it was snow storms, now we have an ice event going on. Needless to say, its not going to be good for walking outside. I guess I'll lay low till it passes. I did manage to finish packing my snacks for the first 6 weeks. After the ice melts, I'll be out with the pack. A friend of mine,(Stickman), just sent me a bunch of pictures from our section hike we had done last spring. Now if that doesn't get the old blood excited, I don't know what will. Thanks Mark.","

My good buddies want to see what its like to carry my pack so while walking at the university we switched off carrying it. Today, the temperature reached 42 degrees. A touch of spring in the air. Will this be what it's like in March on the trail? I'm getting trail fever! The only cure would be to get on the AT asap. I need to start packing the car, NOW!","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553565,"Well today was a good day for ducks. It has rained off and on all day. It's nice to be inside, sitting next to a warm cozy fire and looking out at the weather, rather than to be walking in it today. I'm sure there will be days just like this on the trail. How will I handle those days? Maybe sleep in all day, or head for town, and check into a cozy motel. 
As I sit here watching the inaugural process, I think about trying to walk 2,189 miles and over 5 million steps. One begins to wonder if I might be going mad in my old age. Think about it. The hazards of life in the wild: Bears, snakes, bees, ticks, poison ivy, freezing temps, thunderstorms, possibility of being struck by lighting not to mention how many times I may fall and hopefully not get hurt!!!!! Living out of my pack for six months, sleeping on the ground, protected only by a thin membrane known as a tent. Living like this all the time thinking I could be lying in the warm loving arms of the most wonderful woman in this world. I guess one has to be little crazy when you stop to think about it. But that's what keeps all of us wanabee thru hikers doing what we do. I do enjoy a challenge, for that's what makes us appreciate the good things of life. Never stop believing in your dreams. Huck","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553675,"I'll start out by saying it was a great season for the Packers, but all good things have to come to an end sometime. Today was that day for the Packers. Of course it would have been better if they would have played like they did last week against the Cowboys. Now I can concentrate completely on the upcoming adventure.Got my 2017 AWOL book yesterday, and now can start planning my resupplies and town stops. 5 weeks from today, I'll be sleeping on the ground, somewhere just North of Springer Mt. That's the official start to the Appalachian Trail, but to get there I will need to do the approach trail, which is another 8.5 miles. All up hill. Some people will say skip the approach, but I'm looking at it as an extension of the whole trail. This way I can walk out the hotel door at Amicolola Falls Hotel and start heading north right away. Besides, I've already driven the road to Springer five years ago, when I first started hiking the AT. Now I would like something different, this time. Always looking for a challenge.","

I stepped on the scale, pack and all, and found my pack to weigh more than I had anticipated. It came in at 36.5 pounds. I was hoping for 30-32 lbs. Tomorrow I will need to revise my thinking on some things. Do I really need crampons for example. Maybe only one pair of convertible pants. What about all those candy bars? Better rethink the tarp. I know I can lighten the load by about 4 lbs if I try. Well, I'd better get to it.","

Over this weekend I have managed to get the weight down to 33 pounds. I think I will be able to get to 30 pounds by doing a little more tweaking. Next I will re-evaluate my food supply. I will need to look at snack bars instead of heavy candy like M&M nuts. Also will now evaluate the type of camera gear to take. Having been a professional photographer, all my working life, I will be carrying more gear than a normal thru hiker. I think we can save a little here.","

Met with my brother today, and discussed final plans, as he will accompany me for the first two weeks of this adventure. We will do the approach trail, even though everybody whose has done the approach trail, says it's tough. Will need to carry water with us, as there seems to be no water along the way till we get near Springer Mt. My pack will weigh 30 pounds, with out water and my brothers pack will be 40 pounds without water. I think I will need to start climbing stairs, with my pack, in order to build up my leg muscles for the Mts.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554710,"Today has been an up and down day. Walked well over 4 miles, revised my pack load and finalized hotel reservations at Fontana Dam and Hiawassee, Georgia. Also made reservations at the Amicalola Falls Lodge, in northern Georgia. If all goes well, this time two weeks from now, I will be checked in, at the lodge, and ready to start the approach trail on March 4th. 
I keep tweaking my pack weight, but I'm certain it will be 32 pounds, and no more. It should get lighter as spring turns to summer, and I use summer equipment in the pack. Wouldn't mind seeing 28 pounds during the summer months. 
Glad to see several of the hikers I met, over the last three years, back on the trail again, attempting to conquer that thru hike again. Best of luck to all, and hope to meet up with you on the trail. Getting very excited.","

Nice hiking weather. Now maybe I can get out to hike around here without the snow and ice. Time is going by, way to fast now, and I still have too many things to do before embarking on this great adventure. 
Tonight we had supper with two very special friends, Gary and Sandy. They are the parents of a young lady, Caron, who used to work for Chris and I, in our studio. She was the best, and most ambitious worker we could have ever had, as well as becoming a great friend. Anyway, Gary, Caron and her son Keir will be joining me on the trail, as we hike the Smokies together. It is also planned that my wife, Chris, (trail name Finn), will be joining us for this part of the hike as well. The Smokies span 90 miles and will definitely be a challenge for us all.","

Very unusual for Feb. in Wisconsin. Maybe tomorrow I will try some stairs and a couple of miles on the indoor track. I still have to think that the ""In Shape"" will happen on the trail. I need to remember to start slowly and build mileage over time. 
My friends and my brother-in-law are quite concerned about my attempt at this hike. To that end, they have given me a few things to comfort me on my journey. Kay Z, has given me a small pebble, that she confiscated from the trail a year ago, and would like me to deliver it at Katahdin when I arrive.Terry K has given me a Saint Christopher necklace to wear, in hopes of safe travels. and my brother-in-law has given me three nickels to carry on a necklace, to provide inspiration and determination. He has provided the following explanation. The 1956 nickel is his birth year, so when looking at that one, I will think of him and his strength as he struggles with MS. The 1949 dated nickel will remind me of my wife, and all she has done to encourage me on this endeavor. She truly is an angel. I will miss her the most. And the third nickel is dated 1946. That is my birth year. These three nicklels will travel to Mt. Katahdin with me and will give me the determination to complete my adventure. When I look at any one of them, I will be reminded of the the reason for them in my pack.","

Took 12 hours of driving, but we landed here, in Kultawa, KY., at 8:30 pm. Had a great supper, reorganized the pack, and now relaxing in front of the TV. 
The plan is to meet my brother here, as we did, and tomorrow we will both drive our cars to Hiawassee, GA., where we will leave one car for later pickup. Then on to Amicalola Falls Lodge for Thurs and Fri nights. My brother and I will start walking the approach trail first thing on Sat, the 4th of March. We will only do 5 miles that first day. After that we will increase our mileage slowly up to 10 miles or so over the next week. 
Once we reach Hiawassee, my brother will decide to continue to Fontana Dam or jump in his car and head home to do some camping with his wife. Weather here is GREAT right now, with green grass and a high of 60 tomorrow. Lights out , till later.","

Try to set up a tent in those conditions! Not good! I worked as fast as one can, but everything is against you. Still got it done, but everything seems to be quite wet. Then just after jumping into the tent, to avoid drowning, the storm intensified and wanted to blow me off the mountain. 
After awhile, I managed to cook a spaghetti supper in a bag. That's where you add hot water to the ingredients in a zip lock, and place it in a cozy for 10 minutes. Nice and hot and hit the spot. Follow that with hot coffee and all was well for the night. The rain and wind continued throughout the night. 
This morning was clear, windy and 35 degrees. Slow moving this AM. On trail by 10, but walked a brisk pace. Decided to quit early so as to get to Mountain Crossing, at Neel Gap, before noon tomorrow.

On Monday, my brother dropped me off at Unicoi Gap to start hiking on my own, at 4 am, as he headed back to Wisconsin. There was a gorgeous full moon, so I didn't have to use a headlamp. It was a good day to hike except for the wind gust on top of the Mt. Arrived at Deep Gap Shelter, ate supper and crawled into my tent at 7 pm. Usually people are asleep by 8 pm, which is called hiker midnight. 
Woke this morning to 3"" fresh snow. Temp was 20 degree. After a quick breakfast, packed up and started hiking at 8:30. People I talked to on the trail said it was going to get to the single digits tonight and most were headed into town. Thought I would do the same, but when calling for a room, every place was full. One last call to Holiday Inn and was able to secure the last room. Will zero tomorrow.
So today we call a partial day of walking a Nero day. That's where you don't walk far but still get some mileage. A zero day is one day of no mileage.

Some pretty serious ups and downs today. Some call them PUDs. Pointless ups and downs. Along with the long ups comes some phenomenal views of the Mts. One such place was the Wayah Bald fire tower. It was made of stone and is now only used for tourists to gaze at the distant mountains. My brother and I stopped here three years ago on a section hike. The base was made of rock and the top portion was made of wood. This time I again stopped, to take in the views, but was disappointed to find the top destroyed by fire. All around the mountain side was scorched from last falls forest fires. I've been in the black ashes of the fire now for 5 days.
Arrived at Wesser Bald fire tower at 4 pm. On top of the fire tower platform, I met 3 hikers from Milwaukee. Vic, (Papa Choo choo), Lynn, (Elsa Lyn, as she froze her fingers a few days back and had to leave the trail for a hospital), and Spring Dancer, (Anika their 14 year old grand daughter).

Park rangers were called, from the nearby town of Cheerokee, and two of them arrived at about 10 pm, after hiking 2 hours in the dark.  They stayed at the shelter with the gentleman through the night. Next morning the rangers sent word out for a helicopter to air lift the gentleman to a near by hospital. We were able to assist to a small degree and then to watch an emergency evacuation. That army helicopter hovered JUST above tree tops as they lowered more personnel to help get the victim hooked up to be hoisted into the chopper. We hope and pray that all will be well with Ataboy. Let me tell you, we were literally hanging on a tree to prevent being blown away by the choppers rotors. While watching all the action, we failed to note that a huge piece of heavy metal covering the fireplace chimney was about to let go and come tumbling to the ground. Just before all this happened, I had asked Chris too come and help me stand still as I photographed the event. No sooner had she got to my side and that piece of metal came flying down right where she had been standing. Her angels were watching over her or the rescue crew might have had another passenger.

She wasn't sure she could hike that day to Standing Bear Hostel. After a little candy with sea salt in it, she began to feel better, so on we went. She did start to perk up after a while. About 9 am, it started to rain, and so we put on our rain coats, but not the pants. After all, it was just a little shower. Well that was about as far from the truth as it could be. The rain intensified to a downpour which lasted till 2 pm that afternoon. By then we were all totally soaked and so it was with our packs.

This is a well known hostel and outfitter in Erwin. First thing was an ice cold coke, followed by a Klondike ice cream bar and another coke. Next we called Cantarroso Farm for a pickup and ride to their place for a cabin to stay in for a couple of days. This place is like a Hostel with small cabins, shower, towels and a soft bed. Mike, the owner, decided to take mercy on our downtrodden bodies, and put us up in their house. I had the upstairs bedroom with a deck overlooking the Nolichucky River and its many rapids. After settling in, we were able to wash our clothes, and they definitely needed it's well as your bodies. After a wonderful hot shower, Mike gave us a ride to downtown Erwin, for a hearty pork platter supper, where we also met his wife Peggy. When supper was done, the four of us decided to take in a  movie called The Fate of the Furious. At first I thought I would fall asleep, after the day we had just put in, but not so. We enjoyed every minute of it. Crocs kept getting up due to leg cramps, but was able to enjoy the movie from the back of the theatre. So here we are now taking a zero day, relaxing by the river in zero gravity chairs.        Tomorrow, Easter Sunday, we will add to our adventure by doing a slack pack hike. That's where we will hike from point A to point B with only minimal supplies and spend the evening here again and then continue on Monday. We still cover the miles, but without a fully loaded pack. Seems to be the thing to do here in Erwin. All is well with the body except for a sore big toe on my left foot. I believe it is due to an ingrown toenail. Need to do some TLC on it. Will have it checked out when I come home. I'm planning on coming home near the first week in May.

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563645,"As I mentioned yesterday, I'm staying here at the Lazy Fox B & B in Damascus, VA. I woke to the wonderful smells of bacon, pancakes, eggs, sausage, fresh blueberry muffins and much much, more. upon arriving downstairs, in the dinning room, I saw before me a magnificent hiker feast. Ginney had made a breakfast fit for a king that fed the eight hikers who were staying here. Today I bought a new pack which was only 2.5 pounds empty compared to my old pack that weighed over 5 pounds. Also rented and rode a bike on the Virginia Creeper trail from the top of Mt. Rogers back to Damascus. My brother Val, recommended that I take an afternoon and ride the Creeper trail, so I did. It was one of the most beautiful rides I have ever been on. Thanks Val. ""The Creeper"" basically was a railroad that existed back in the 1880's. The railroad began in Abingdon, Virginia as the Abingdon Coal and Iron Railroad Co. It was believed that the land, in the area, was rich with minerals such as coal and iron. During the late 1880's the rail company began to secure land rights to build a railroad from Abingdon to Damascus. By 1890 not a rail had been laid. Expenses were mounting and after thousands of dollars were spent, the company was broke. In 1884 the company was taken over by another rail company and after it too filed bankruptcy, another rail company took over the rights to the land. At this time lumber was big in the area and at the top of Mt. Rogers there was plenty of forested land to be had.  It took several years of laying timbers for bridges in the area, and by 1918 the line stretched 75 miles and included more than 100 trestles. The locals referred to the train that climbed eastward ever so slowly up the mountain as the ""Virginia Creeper"". A steam engine laboring up mountain grades with heavy loads of lumber, iron ore, supplies and passengers.  The last train to run on these tracks occurred on March 31, 1977.   Track removal began the following year. In 1979 the rail bed was converted to a bike trail from the top of Mt. Rogers all the way down to Damascus. A total of 14 miles. All downhill. To do the whole length of this trail you would start at Mt. Rogers and go all the way toward Abingdon, Virginia. A total of 34.3 miles.
 After that I decided to go to the outfitter store in downtown Damascus to replace my pack. My old pack, which is an Osprey Exos 58, just wasn't fitting me right. I picked up a new pack call ULA circuit, medium size, and it fits me much better. Also while there I did my resupply for the next five days. The new pack feels and works great.","

At 2 AM I hear the pitter patter of rain on the metal roof of the shelter and  I knew it would be a rainy day as that's what the forecast called for. I was on the trail by 7 AM Tuesday morning fully dressed in my finest rain gear. 
I was going rather slow due to the weather conditions. At 10:30 AM I went to step up on a rock which was rather tall and in the process of pushing off with my right leg I tore a muscle in my calf.  The pain put me on my knees for a short period. After I recovered I tried to walk but it was quite painful. Shortly after the pain subsided a little, I decided to take three Advil. As the day went on the pain became less and less. I knew something was terribly wrong and for that reason decided to go slower, as if I wasn't going slow enough already.

While setting up in the shelter, a group of high school kids came in to camp behind the shelter. Also I met two men who had hiked the Camino de Santiago two years earlier. They highly recommended that I do that hike with my wife. It sounds very interesting and will require a little research. I think that is something that Chris would enjoy doing.

I favored my right leg and the pain seem to be getting less. At this point the plan was to try to make it to Thomas knob shelter which would be about a 12 mile hike. This area that I was approaching is called Grayson Highland and is known for its wild ponies that roam free. And yes indeed I saw several wild ponies and even petted one of them. 
 By mid afternoon the fog had let up and I had arrived at Thomas knob shelter, only to find the shelter completely full with people and many campers outside the shelter as well. This meant I had to move on to the next shelter which is called Wise Shelter  and would be another 5 miles of hiking which I was not looking forward to. But I had no choice. I arrived at Wise shelter at 6:30 in the evening and found it also crowded with people.  There was room for camping though, so I proceeded to pick a spot to set up my tent. As Murphy's Law would have it, it started to rain just as I unpacked my pack. I put things back in quickly and covered my pack up and stood there with my raincoat and rain pants on for one hour while the storm passed overhead. Finally the storm pass and I was able to set up my camp and crawl in bed for the night. This will have been my worst day on the trail so far due to the weather,injuring my leg and stumbling over rocks in the Grayson Highlands as well as walking farther than I had wanted to, do to the overcrowding in the shelters.","Marion, VA

First of all I would like to say thank you to all the people who have responded to my journal entries. Please understand I cannot answer your inquiries from this site. Also it would take quite a bit of time to respond to everybody's comments. Time that I need to spend on the trail walking and not on the internet. But I do appreciate the comments and they do give me encouragement to continue walking. Several people asked me to define a thru hike. A thru hike is defined as starting a hike on a specific date and finishing within 12 months of that start date. Some hikers might start their hike at the end of June, in Maine, and hike to Harpers Ferry in one year and then the following year start hiking north from Georgia to Harpers Ferry and get done before the end of June of that year and then that would still be considered a thru hike. By the way I should apologize sometimes when I am not able to get a journal entry sent out only because I do not have cell service in some of the regions that I am hiking through. When I am in town at a hotel or hostel then it's easy to get caught up on all my journal entries thus you will see sometimes that I might have a daily mileage of 60.1 miles. That might be an accumulation of three days of hiking. The running mileage would be correct up to that date. Today's date being 22 May I have gone 655 miles to Stony Creek Valley Road. Tomorrow Tuesday, May 23, I will be heading north again.

I usually wake up around 6 AM, have a quick breakfast of oatmeal or grits, and start packing up by 7 AM. Once I crawl out of the tent I would take the tent down, put it on top of my pack, lash everything down and start walking.I usually start out at a slow pace until I get warmed up. I will have studied the map the night before so I know where I'm headed for on that particular day. I would also be looking at the water availability for that particular days hike to make sure I don't run dry. I usually carry 1 L of water with me for the days use. You really don't want to carry more than 1 L of water for the days use as water runs 2 pounds per liter. If it's a hot day and I run low on water I would stop at a stream or a spring, collect and filter water. I do take breaks during the day while hiking. Usually around 10 AM, lunch break at 12 noon and again maybe around 3 PM. I would like to be in camp by 6 PM each night. I typically do not stay in shelters and I only use shelters as a mileage marking point. I have only slept in a shelter four nights so far on this trip. Once I arrive at a designated camping spot, whether it be a shelter or not, the first thing I usually do is collect water for cooking my supper. At that time I also get water to replenish my drinking water. That water has to be filtered. The cooking water I boil for at least one minute before using it to cook with. After supper I wash up my pot that I cooked supper in and get ready for bed by 7:30 PM. I am usually asleep by 8 PM which is called hiker midnight.That would be a typical day.

Since I was famished, I figured I can walk another mile yet, so down I went. It was raining a little so I had rain pants and rain coat on. On the way down the hill, I thought I might jog a little to stay warm, so off I went. After a few hundred yards, I thought better of running so I stopped and went to check my phone to see if I had a signal. WHAT? NO PHONE! I thought I had put it in my raincoat pocket before leaving my tent. Where is it? Maybe I didn't put it in my pocket after all, when I was back at the tent. It must still be in the tent.

I looked around the restaurant and so four people eating a nice meal of chicken. I thought I saw them drive in earlier, so being desperate as I was, I walked over and asked if they were staying at the same campground as I. They said they were and so I gave them my story of the phone and asked if they would be so kind to give me a ride back to my tent. They graciously said they would when they had finished their meal. After arriving back at the campground and back to my tent I checked for the phone. Nope, not there! It must have fallen out of my rain jacket pocket when jogging down to the restaurant. It was raining harder now, but I have to see if my phone is laying somewhere along the roadside. It may have jumped up of the rain coat pocket when I started to jog down the road. The pockets in my rain jacket are rather shallow in depth. I looked but couldn't find it. Went back to the camp store, in case they found it. No luck. Upon leaving the store, I walked through the tall grass, between the store and the highway one more time, just in case I missed it the first time I had retraced my steps in that area, and there, face down, was my phone getting wet from the rain.

This way I can still complete a thru hike within the 12 months but I would be able to summit Mt. Katahdin, in Maine during the warm weather months and not the colder months of Sept., or October. The verdict is still out on what to do in that regard.Here is just a recap of the last few days on the trail as I have not had cell service till now. On the 10th of June I hiked 13 miles to a place called the Pinnacles where I stealth camped for the night which means just setting up camp on a flat spot just off the trail. On the 11 June I woke up early and hit the trail before 6 AM to watch the sunrise and beat the heat that was expected that day. Total miles hiked was 18 1/2. Arrived at Gravel Springs Hut at 5 PM and decided to call it quits for the day. During the night two ladies were woke up at 2 AM by a bear outside their tent. They let out a loud scream and the bear evidently ran away. Needless to say the women did not sleep the rest of the night.Many people have seen bears in the Shenandoah Park area but I have yet to see one.And June 12, I again woke up early and was hiking by 7 AM. Today my goal is to get to Front Royal where I will proceed to get a shuttle to take me to Harpers Ferry for the night. Then it's on to Baltimore by Amtrak and then a plane ride back to Minneapolis Minnesota where my lovely wife will pick me up from the airport at about 10 PM Wednesday night.Now I'm sitting in the train station, waiting for AmTrack. It's 2 hours late so far. Still waiting !","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570080,"Well folks I'm back on the trail....almost. After a week at home, I spent 4 days with my son and his two boys on what we call our annual boys baseball trip. We started this tradition about 8 years ago. We go to a ball park and take in a couple games, tour the stadium and also tour that area of the country. We all love it and enjoy the male bonding time. This year, because I am hiking the trail, we decided to take in the Nationals of Washington, DC. We watched two games and then went to three different museums. After that, the boys wanted to experience hiking the trail with me, so we decided to go back to McAfee Knob and have them hike up to the knob and past to a campsite for the night. We are now cowboy camping tonight just past the knob. Cowboy camping is where you find a level spot on the ground and lay out a bed roll and sleep under the stars. No tent. Here's hoping all goes well.","

Last night my son and his two boys and I, cowboy camped about half a mile past McAfee knob. The boys were very excited to be able to sleep under the stars, not to mention the idea of peeing in the woods. We won't even mention the fact that Nate has mastered the difficult task of learning to poop by sitting on a downed tree. I've never seen a boy so proud as he came running out of the woods after accomplishing his task. My other grandson Benjamin has perfected the art of peeing on trees in the woods. He is only 10 years old, but has picked up the art of that task fairly quickly. One thing Ben has got todo is to check the trail for other hikers before carrying out his task. Although the two people who hiked right past him, as he was performing his task, had quite a little chuckle as they walked by unbeknown to him.I am in a hotel tonight in Front Royal, Virginia and will hike the trail tomorrow around 10am. My plan would be to hike to Harpers Ferry by next Saturday. At this point I do not plan on flip-flopping my hike. I will make that decision around September 1st. I will see how far I can get going north before I make that decision. I am hoping to increase my mileage per day to somewhere between 15 to 20 miles per day. After being gone from the trail for about 10 days I noticed that my legs have gotten a little weaker. So because of this I will start rather slow and again slowly build up to my mileage.This blog was suppose to have accompanied the pic. the other day.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570496,"June 30th. I woke early to get a start on the day before it gets too hot. Also wanted to walk 3 miles to a Hostel, called ""Bears Den"", that was serving breakfast till 9 am. I arrived at 9 am, and they were done serving, so I opted for a breakfast of Ben & Jerry's mint chocolate chip ice cream and two Pepsi's. That should give me enough energy to finish up the roller coaster which I have been on since yesterday. The roller coaster is a series of ups and downs approximately 500 feet up and down for thirteen miles. These are very steep ascents and decents. I had already done half of the roller coaster yesterday and now finished the other half today. I am glad to be done with them and out of Virginia. Virginia claims to have the most miles of the Appalachian Trail at about 500 total. I entered West Virginia this afternoon. I am now camped at David Lesser Memorial Shelter which is at mile marker 1014.4. It's good to be here on such a hot day. The last couple days have been in the mid 80s and 80% humidity. This heat and humidity really take a toll on me, and right now I feel pretty exhausted. Tomorrow I will hike 10 miles into Harpers Ferry and probably zero on Sunday.

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570600,"I made it to Harpers Ferry today by 1 o'clock. The day has been very hot and muggy. The high temperature today was 85 with 85% humidity. I'm currently staying at the Tea Horse hostel in Harpers Ferry and enjoying the air conditioning of our room.Today is my 71st birthday and so I decided to treat myself to a big steak and an ice cream sundae for dessert at a place called the Anvil. It's just a block from the hostel. The weather forecast for all next week is supposed to be upper 80s low 90s and humid again so best that I get used to it. I don't mind the humid conditions but the temperature and the humidity together really take a toll on me. I am forever wiping my brow of sweat. At the same time I'm usually consuming 3 to 4 L of water per day to keep hydrated. Yesterday it was 91 degrees in the mountains. When I came across a creek, I decided to pour several liters of water all over me and my clothes, to cool me off. Man did that cold shower feel good. It was early afternoon and I was just so hot I had to cool off and cool off quickly. I actually felt faint for a little bit. The cool water definitely brought my body temperature down and then I felt much better. Also hiking with wet clothes has a cooling affect upon the body, sorta like air conditioning. The lesson I learned from that is to slow down, take it easy and try to consume more liquids. Maybe I don't have to do 15 miles a day. It might be better to cut down to 12 until the heat wave passes.
Thursday and Friday I did the roller coaster and that has taken a big toll on me as far as the energy is concerned. I hope not to see rocks and hills like that again until I get to Maine.As I said earlier I am currently in Harpers Ferry and I feel I need a day off. I will zero on Sunday and hit the trail again on Monday. I understand the ups and downs won't be as bad through Maryland. Hard to believe I've done five states so far and have gone 1023 miles. My body feels pretty good except for my calves, which hurt after walking the roller coaster. My mind is wondering why I'm doing this hike. I guess that's a normal reaction from people who reach Harpers Ferry. They question why they're doing the hike at this point. I've talked to several people who have now left the trail here at Harpers Ferry and are calling it quits. I hope to continue and get to Maine by the end of September. Only time will tell. I feel pretty good right now for a 71-year-old man who's living his dream, (or has it become a nightmare?)By the way, you'll note that my journal entries are longer and more detailed, when I get into town and recuperate for a night. I usually have more time to post and of course the Internet is available. Also I should point out the problem I'm having with the mileage. Today I only walked 8.7 miles to get into Harpers Ferry. But because the mileage is off, I put down 25.4 miles to get me up to the total mileage where I should be which would be about 1023.1.","David Lesser Shelter

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570728,"Today was a great day. I woke at 7 o'clock and Ben, the owner of Tea Horse Hostel, made waffles for breakfast. I had one and a half plus some orange juice and a banana before brushing my teeth and heading out for a walk, (without my pack).It's hard to explain, but when I came into town yesterday, I took a shortcut to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy which bypassed about a mile of the trail. Not to miss any part of the trail, I decided to go back today and hike that mile which runs along the cliffs of the Shenandoah river and into the old district of Harpers Ferry. What a wonderful experience it was. Of course there is a lot of Civil War history here in Harpers Ferry. I saw the ruins of churches and old buildings. A lot of buildings have been restored to their pre-Civil War condition. In the historic part of town, you will find  a lot of the homes and buildings are made of old bricks and stone from that area. Quite a charming look for a small little town .Old Harpers Ferry is a small quiet town and has no stoplights and no grocery store. In order to resupply I had to go to the local 7-11 to buy food for the next 4 to 5 days. How different and unique.After returning to the hostel I decide to take a nice long nap in air-conditioned comfort before going out later tonight for supper. Tomorrow my plan would be to get up and have breakfast and then get back to the trail. I have to walk about a half a mile through town to get back to the trail and then I will head to Maryland Heights which is approximate 2 1/2 miles from Harpers Ferry. Maryland Heights is a rock promontory at the 2000 foot elevation mark. It's also four miles off the AT. From this viewpoint I should have a good look at Harpers Ferry and will be able to get some good images. After Maryland Heights, I will come back down from the mountaintop and hike to a place called Ed Garvey shelter which is about 8, maybe 9, miles north on the AT. At that point I will be in the state of Maryland. That will be the sixth state of the fourteen. Temperatures tomorrow are supposed be near 90 and relative humidity will be in the high 80s.It's mind boggling to me to think that I have walked 1023 miles so far and covered five states. Hopefully the adventure will continue. Maryland is next.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570791,"Where to begin. This morning after a waffle breakfast, I left the Tea Horse Hostel at 7:30. It was going to be another scorcher of a day, so wanted to get going as early as possible, but had to wait for those waffles. Also today I wanted to hike 2 miles off the trail to take a photo of Harpers Ferry from an outcropping, high above the town. This place is known as Maryland Heights and is 2000 feet above the town. There is a separate trail, off the AT, that leads the two miles up to the lookout.Unfortunately I have my pack with me and it now weighs in the neighborhood of 30 pounds with food for five days and a liter of water. As I was walking up the trail, I thought that it would be nice to stow my pack in the woods, off the trail, till I come back from the lookout so I don't have to carry it all the way up and back . After all, it was starting to get hot and the trail was all up hill. I wanted to find a good spot to hide my pack that has lots of cover. A quarter mile up I found what I thought would be the perfect hiding location. It has thick ground cover and dropped off quickly, and it has a ledge about 7 or 8 feet down that I can get to, to hide the pack. Let's look a little more closely.The next thing I knew I was flying through the air, and at the same time rotating my left shoulder so as to roll onto my back, and landed on the pack. The ledge broke my fall, and also provided a springboard affect which propelled me to become airborne again till I landed in a pile of loose rock 12 feet below the first ledge. After sliding to a face down stop, I realized I made a big mistake. The first thing I did was to check all extremities. Still intact! Blood was staining the grey talus as I lay there wondering how lucky I was not to still be rolling down the hill for another 200 feet or more.I slowly gathered my strength to sit up and wipe the blood from my face. Surveying the situation, I came up with this. I fell about twenty or more feet. Nothing seems broken, but some mighty sore areas. Both elbows, right shoulder, face and left hip are all throbbing. I don't remember unbuckling my pack, but it lay next to me. Then I realized that my glasses are gone as well as my hiking stick. I struggled to stand on this steep slope and not slide down the hill farther, but stand I did. I looked for my glasses but to no avail. No walking stick either. I grabbed my pack, and decided to get back to the trail from where I had fallen. This took all of 30 minutes as it was a very steep climb on loose rock, and also I continued to look for my glasses and my Black Diamond hiking stick. As I emerged on top of the trail I found myself standing next to my walking stick but no glasses. I dragged my pack up behind me, set it on the trail and sat next to it to regroup. After ten minutes and some snacks, I started to feel somewhat better and was able to get my face cleaned up and blood to stop flowing. I checked all extremities and they seem all functional, so decided to continue my trek to Maryland Heights overlook. The view from the overlook was spectacular!After taking some pictures of Harpers Ferry, it was time to get down and start hiking on the AT. I am now in camp, with lots of Ibuprofen in me and trying to rest tonight before going slow tomorrow to the next campground. I thank God, for watching over me on that stupid maneuver. I always like to look for the positive in a situation like this, and believe me there are many positives that can be seen in this accident. Things could have turned out a lot worse. I will count my blessing tonight.  Humbly signing off, Huck.","Harpers Ferry

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571066,"July 5. Most all aches and pains are now gone except for the pain in my left butt cheek. I must have landed pretty hard on it during the fall. Nothing seems to be broken except my ego. I remember feeling pretty proud of myself when I reached Harpers Ferry thinking I'm doing really good. Well, you know what happens when you get a little too cocky. I guess you might say I deserved it. I'll try not to make that mistake again. July 4th, I only hiked 11 miles to a backpackers only campground and arrived at noon. I wanted to take it easy and relax the rest of the day. First thing I did was to take a 20 minute HOT shower, since they had a shower house in the campground. Felt great!!!! The blood didn't wash off my face as well as I thought it would. It wasn't blood, that I saw on my face, but rather scrapes from my fall as my face was kissing the rock talus while I was sliding head first down the rock talus. After my shower, I set up my tent in a shady spot followed by doing laundry in the bathroom sink. After hanging clothes, I found myself in the tent taking a well deserved nap.During my PRT time,(personal rest time), many hikers came in and set up their tents. One person was Morning Glory who I had met a couple of days earlier. We decided to hike a half a mile to this restaurant which was just off the trail near the town of Boonesborro, Maryland. The only thing is, being the Fourth of July, it was closed. New plan. Call and order pizza. Called but everything in town was closed. We found a deli that was open and decided to order 18 cheese burgers, 6 order of chicken tenders and two big bottles of Pepsi. Everybody back at camp was ecstatic when we finally returned. It was a good Fourth of July celebration. We were able to provide trail magic for a group of hikers and it felt good.Woke this morning and hiked 14 miles to this shelter and now ready for a good nights rest.July 6 th. Hiked all day in rain. One time it was a deluge for 45 minutes. I am now completely soaked so I have decided to call it a day and call a shuttle service to take me into Fayetteville Pennsylvania. There I will stay at a motel where Chris has already shipped me another pair of glasses. I will try to blog more tomorrow. There is poor cell service her, even in this small town. I hope the picture that I sent came through. I won't know until I close out of this program and send out this blog.

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571216,"Yesterday, 6 July, I must've been quite tired when I did my blog and did NOT proof read my journal entry. There were a few spelling errors. I'm sure most people can read around those mistakes, so I say thank you for your understanding and patience. Please know that I blog as often as I can when I have service. But many times I do not have service in the wilderness between two mountain ranges, in which case I try to catch up when I have service next or I'm in town as I am now.The Appalachian Mountain Range was formed millions of years ago through the earths transformation of uplifting and shifting in the earths crust. 
It was in the early 20s that a man by the name of Benton MacKaye came up with the idea of forming a trail from southern United States to northern Maine through the Appalachian Mountains. It wasn't till 1932 that Myron Avery was able to join forces with Benton MacKaye and complete the trail. Avery wanted this trail to be the ""peoples path"". It was in 1948 that Earl Schaffer, a World War II veteran, hiked the complete length of the trail, which we now call a ""thru hike"". Since then, thousands have completed a successful thru hike. Notable are veterans and veterans with disabilities. I am also aware of one blind person, with the help of his dog, completing the trail as well as a paralyze lady. People of all ages from 8 to 80 have completed a thru hike over the years. The length of the trail changes every year due to rerouting of certain sections of it. This year the trails length is 2189.4 miles. The psychological halfway point on the trail is Harpers Ferry, WV., even though it's not the mileage halfway point. The actual mileage halfway point would be another 6 1/2 miles south of Pine Grove Furnace State Park, in PA., in the middle of nowhere.
So why have I given you all this information? I did so because I am in a town called Fayetteville, PA taking a zero today. Also, as I have said earlier, I have more time on my hands to blog when I'm in town. Besides that, it's kind of fun to do a little bit more writing on my blog. The only other thing that I accomplished today was to resupply for the next five days and to pig out at the local restaurant. Tomorrow, Saturday July 8th, I will be back on the trail at 9:30 am hiking north to continue living my dream and adventure. And what an adventure it has been so far. It is difficult to keep an accurate record of the mileage that I do every day. That is why sometimes when I try to catch up on the mileage it might say I've done 35 miles but in my blog I will put the actual mileage that I did which might be 15 for example.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571561,"July 10, 2017. Today I hit the actual halfway mark for 2017 on the Appalachian Trail at 1094.9. I am camped at James Fry Shelter campground and the mileage for that is 1109.6. In the last two days I have done an average of 18 miles per day. I think I've finally developed my hiking legs. Yesterday I met a 23-year-old gentleman who calls himself Rocket. He just up and quit his work to hike the Appalachian Trail. Yesterday was the second day on the trail when I met him, and he seems very unprepared as I looked at his pack, his gear and his attitude and I fear he will not do well on the trail. He has no trail experience , no food, and no sense of what it takes to survive on the Appalachian Trail for three months. I wish Rocket well because he's going to need it.Today I came in to a town called Pine Grove Furnace where there is a convenient store and a tradition of what they call an ice cream challenge. What the challenge is, is to eat a half a gallon of ice cream in a half and hour and then you get a prize of a wooden spoon like we used to get in the little Dixie cups of ice cream. For this contest, the hiker pays a charge of $10 for a half a gallon of ice cream, ( flavor of his/her choice ),which is really only 3 pints, so then they have to buy another pint of ice cream for four dollars. It seems a little pricey to eat all that ice cream only to get sick afterwards and only to win a small wooden spoon that could give your tongue splinters. Oh yes you do get bragging rights. I did have a small dish of two scoops of ice cream though after I finished a bacon cheeseburger, french fries, two Pepsi's and a chocolate milk. For some reason I crave chocolate milk out here. But it has to be the whole chocolate milk not 1% or 2%.I take after my brother-in-law Bruce that way.","Birch Run Shelter

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571808,"Tuesday, July 11.    I hiked from James Fry Shelter pass Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania and I ended up at Darlington Shelter at about 9pm. The total distance covered Tuesday was 26.3 miles. My longest day yet. The reason for the extended mileage is due to the fact that 10 miles of that total went through farmlands which was pretty flat. Also the weather was cloudy and not so hot.Today, July 12th, I hiked from Darlington Shelter to Duncannon Pennsylvania. Total 11.3 miles. I had a hard time hiking today due to several factors. Number one I think I'm wore out from yesterday's hike, and the terrain was quite hilly and full of rocks. Hikers refer to this state as Rocksylvania instead of Pennsylvania. Now I see why. The rocks are extremely hard to walk on plus the fact that they're all slanting at different angles. It's hard on the feet. My mileage, I expect, will drop to between 10 and 14 miles a day because of the rocks. This will be the norm until I get out of Rocksylvania.Another factor making my hiking difficult is the weather. Today the temperature was 88° with 85% humidity and very little wind to cool me off. I was warned about the humidity in the mid Atlantic states, and now I know what he meant. The combination of the rocks , the heat, and the humidity just saps the energy out of you. Tonight I'm staying in the Doyle Hotel in downtown Duncannon Pennsylvania. This hotel is an icon to the hikers that passed through this town. It dates back to about 1920, and has no air conditioning and the rooms are very small. The window is open but only warm humid air comes in. I am fortunate though because I do have a fan in my room sitting on the floor blowing warm humid air on me as I write this blog.Every Wednesday the Catholic Church here in town, puts on a free hiker AYCE feast. Spaghetti, bread, lots of milk, (chocolate for me), Gator Aid, and lots of green stuff called salads. Oh yeah. Forgot to mention lots of watermelon and ice cream for desert. They also had a hiker resupply available for anybody who might need it. And it was all for free. What a great treat.","Darlington Shelter

We had lightning, we had thunder and we also had a hailstorm. We did manage to hike 15.1 miles to a shelter called Eagles Nest.

A little side note here. When hitchhiking you really are putting your life at risk. The driver who took the three of us back to Port Clinton, was in his 80's, and must have been blind as a bat, as he would breeze right through two stop signs with nary a flinch.

Many places were bad enough to be referred to as ankle busters. Half way through the hike today, we came across a tavern on the highway next to the AT. Naturally we had to stop for a beer or two. Then we managed to rock hop to our campsite here at New Tripoli Campsite. Total of 13.3 miles. The feet need to rest. Raining cats and dogs now.

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572727,"Today was a very hot day. High of 93 and humid. That alone takes the energy away, let alone rock hopping. The picture is of a place called the Knifes Edge. The rocks, here, run at an angle and on each side of the edge it drops off sharply. You don't want to fall that's for sure!!!!! Otherwise we had big rocks for about 2 miles of the trail today. The same is expected tomorrow. That makes slow going. Also we have to be careful as the rocks are wet and slippery. You know it is humid when the rocks are sweating. I look forward to leaving Pennsylvania next week, after Delaware Water Gap.

Checked in here at the Deer Head Inn and immediately laid out all our wet gear. Then it was off to explore the town. One of the things that a hiker has a taste for when on the trail, besides a beer, would be sweets. This town has many small wayside stores full of fresh baked pastries. rolls, pies, donuts and much more. Chief and I were able to bring a couple of items back to the hotel to enjoy on the balcony near our room. After that, Chief lit up a cigar, and I indulged in a cold brew from the cooler down stairs.

Next on the agenda was to go to the Village Farmer store for a pie, to be eaten later that evening. After our snack of French Onion soup and chicken wings, and the visit to the best pie place in town, we got a taxi ride to a local Wal Mart for resupply. While we were shopping the power failed back in the Gap, so when we got back to our room we needed to use our head lamps to see. Power was restored about 10 pm. In the mean time, Chief and I sat on the veranda enjoying quiet conversation and a strawberry, rhubarb pie. A nice evening indeed. Tuesday, July 25. Went back to Village Farmer for breakfast, packed up our packs and was on the trail by 10 am. Within an hour we were in New Jersey and no longer cursing the rocks of Pennsylvania. Although no one told the rocks that they could not cross the state line. We still have rocks. Also no one told Mother Nature to turn off the sprinklers. Rain again all afternoon.

I apologize for people watching my blog and not receiving any updates but I have been very tired since I've gotten home as well as trying to reorganize my pack for the final leg of my trip.The plan, as it stands now, would be that I would leave home on Sunday, drive to Madison, where I would meet my brother and we would drive together out to New York State. There my brother and I would hike for the next two weeks and cover New York, Connecticut and get into Massachusetts. At that point, I will need to evaluate where and when I should do a flip-flop. We would then go to Katahdin and start hiking south. As many people know, the state of Maine will close Baxter State Park on or before October 15. It is in Baxter State Park that the mountain Katahdin resides and thus if they close the park on or before the 15th, I may not be able to summit Katahdin at that time and then I would not be able to finish my thru-hike this year. That is why I would do a flip-flop sometime in September. The most pressing thing right now would be Jenny and that little nugget. That's what we are calling the child till she gives birth.

It was right on the beach next to the water and out of the wind, as it was VERY windy that day. Nice sunrise Monday, and a calm lake. I heard some splashing going on outside ny tent on the beach, so I had to investigate. As I unzipped my tent fly I saw three beavers frolicing in the shallows just outside the tent door. After a few minutes, I stood up which of course scared them and they quickly dove under and made the typical beaver splash. After a quick breakfast I decided to try to find a leak in my air mattress. Since the waters were calm it would be easy to find the escaping bubbles. Sure enough I was able to locate a small hole. Now to fix it. I did have patch material with me so it would just take time to dry the mattress and then patch it. I told Black Sheep to start hiking and that I would catch up in a while. Patching went well and I was back on the trail at 9:15. About two hours after Black Sheep left to hike. I finally caught up to him ten miles later at about 3:30 pm. Then we walked together to Antlers Campground arriving at 5:30 pm. We set up camp on a point of land next to the lake and enjoyed a quick supper before heading to bed at 7:30.

Maybe about 20 people all heading north. Only one other person was south bound.  Today the weather was cool and cloudy with rain expected tonight, as we are getting now. We did 14.1 miles today. Since Black Sheep left an hour before me, he didn't get to enjoy any trail magic. When I came out to this road crossing, there was a pickup parked and the gentleman had just placed a cooler in the woods with pop and chips a little ways in from the road. Many times a trail angel will just put a cooler full of ice and drinks just out of sight from the road, but on the trail so hikers can enjoy their kindness. I had a bag of chips and a coke. I also took two more cokes and four small bags of chips so I could share them with Black Sheep when I catch up to him. I knew he had missed the angels because they had just place the cooler in the woods before I got there and I had not yet caught up to Black Sheep.  Sept 4  It rained all night last night. I got a little wet in the tent due to the wind blowing so hard and a constant rain. Also I think the tent is showing it's age as it is starting to leak from the seams. Need to purchase seam sealer and touch up a few holes when I can.
 Had to pack up this morning with wet tent. We started out with a gentle up which as the morning went by became very steep and rugged. We were climbing White Cap Mt. Finally broke through tree-line at 12:30 pm. Beautiful views all around. We were able to get out of the wind by going behind some small spruce trees. There we laid out all our wet gear on the rocks to dry in the wind and the sun. Also ate our lunch. Walked down the Mt. side, up another Mt., and down again and did that one more time before coming to Sydney campground. Past hiker midnight now, so will say good night. Yes, I am ""living the dream"".
Sept 5, Tues. Today found us getting a little later start than normal. Joining Black Sheep and I, was a man from Anchorage Alaska by the name of Holcomb. We walked and talked all day together. It was a good hike with a few ups and downs. After about five miles we came to a shallow river where I took my shoes off and waded across. Next we came to another steep uphill. To climb this mountain, it would take one hour and fifteen minutes to go just one mile. That's how steep it was.  Once at the top we would take a side trail to some camping spots on a lake called Chairback Pond. The thing is now we needed to go down steeply for a quarter mile to the pond. What a workout. We set up camp, ate supper and crawled into our tents just as it started to rain. Tonight we all will fall asleep to raindrops on our tents. More to follow.","

Black Sheep and I agreed to take a zero today, as the trail will be nothing but mud and water. It's also dangerous to walk on wet roots and rocks. I would prefer not to get hurt if possible.  At breakfast, in the lodge, we decided to try to get a ride into Monson, ME. Where we could resupply and get some good food. When checking for a ride we connected with Brent, the manager of this lodge, and he offered us a ride into Monson, as he was headed that way to get some groceries for the lodge. He was glad to offer a ride into town some 30 miles away and we were glad to accept his offer. 
Once in Monson, we found a hostel called Shaws. After talking with the owner, Black Sheep and I arranged for a shuttle back to Millinocket, where Black Sheep left his car 10 days earlier. Also made reservations at AT Lodge Hostel to spend the night before my brother heads back to WI. Thanks to Black Sheep for hiking with me for the past two weeks. I enjoyed his company.
Sept. 9, Friday. 7.8 miles Woke up at 6 am, packed up and drove to McDonalds for breakfast and then Black Sheep drove me back to the area where we left the trail on Wednesday. It started out as a sunny day and temp in the low 50s.We said our good byes at 8 am and headed two different directions. He headed Black to WI. and I hit the trail. It was a good day to hike till 1 pm when the rain returned. I put the pack cover on the pack and put on my rain coat and continued walking . It stopped after about 15 minutes and the sun returned.  As I walked down a steep hill I came face to face with an old friend called Old School. We were both happy to see each other. We sat on the trail and talked for about an hour before we had to say good bye and get back to hiking. Shortly after leaving him it started to rain again only this time with a vengeance. It started out slow and grew to full blown storm with lots of hail. It poured for about 45 minutes. Time to get to a shelter and call it a day. Tomorrow should be better.?????","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577360,"I started my day off with a cup of grits and some hot apple cider. Walked one mile to Long Pond River where I had to take my shoes off and ford the river barefoot. Luckily there was also a heavy duty rope across the river to hang onto as you crossed. It did come in handy a couple of times as I slipped on the rocks. After that the rest of the trail is as usual. Steep ups and downs, to the point that you use all fours to go up and over. That takes a lot of energy on each climb. I usually can handle 2 maybe 3 hills like that but today there must have been 6 or 7 of them. Then I came to Little Wilson River. This required another ford. Only thing is there was no rope to hang onto this time. It was also a wider river than this morning and deeper. I put all electronics in zip locks and started across. The current was quite swift but I moved very slowly to make sure of my footing. After 20 minutes I had made it to the other side. Whew!!!!! Once I landed I met another hiker I had met in NC by the name of Papa John. He and his wife, (Trail Princess), were thru-hiking together. When asked where was Princess he told me she had a very bad fall and had to quit. She was hurt real bad, especially the face and right eye. She's a trooper for sure.
And then I took off to climb another hill. As I started to climb it started to rain again!!!!! It only lasted 30 minutes, about long enough to get everything wet and slippery. 
Time for bed and guess what? It's RAINING again. Pleasant dreams.","Long Pond Shelter

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577427,"Well finally the weather turned nice today. Slept in the shelter last night, just in case it rained, and it did. But I woke up nice and dry this AM and it was sunny.
I only hiked 3 miles today to Highway 15 where I took a break at the wayside where the trail crosses the highway. While there, a shuttle van from Shaw's Hostel showed up with two NoBo, {north bound}, hikers ready to continue their hike. This was my opportunity to get a ride into Monson and stay at the Hostel for a day before continuing on my trek, so I hopped on for the ride back into town. 
I've enjoyed a relaxing day here but am now ready to hit the trail tomorrow and to put in some serious time on my dream. Don't know if I can finish now but will go as far south as I can before quitting. Also I now have to keep an eye on Hurricane Irma and see how that will affect my hike.

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577637,"Monday Sept 11. 17.9. Miles The image above was taken during a river crossing. Had a fantastic 7 coarse breakfast at Shaw's before packing up and getting shuttled back to the trail. Sunny and warm. No sooner did I start hiking and I came across some trail magic. Some trail angel left a few  bananas and clementines for the hikers. I carried one banana and two Clementines with me for a break later.  The terrain was relatively flat so I booked along till lunchtime. Ate my fruit and moved on. Today I had two fords to cross. Both were rather uneventful. Arrived at the shelter at 6pm. Later than I usually hike. I like to be off the trail by 5 pm. 
Tues. Sept. 12. 13.1. Miles Woke to loons calling from the lake below the shelter. Made me homesick for my cabin. Today would prove a little harder than yesterday. Had to climb Pleasant Pond Mountain, which was a climb of 1500 feet and not easy by any means. Mostly ROCKS. Maine must be getting me ready for the Whites in NH. By 6 pm I found my self totally spent of energy and at the shelter. Made a quick supper and was in bed by 7 o'clock.
September 13. 6.0 miles I wish to thank all the people who have sent me well wishes so far. I hope you know I can't reply to them all, but please understand that I do appreciate your words of encouragement, especially as I get closer to the end of this adventure. I try to send out a blog when I have service, but when your in the valley between two Mts. it's pretty I also know that the mileage is hard to keep track of, as I am doing my southbound hike at this time. I will try to keep it as accurate as possible and keep the running total, so that you know how many miles I've gone and how many miles I may have left. They say that the western part of Maine is very rocky and challenging. I am looking forward to that challenge. Today was an easier day of hiking. I hiked 6 miles to a town called Caratunk Maine. It is here that I decided to take a Nero day. There is a small B&B and will relax the rest of the day. Also resupply for the next three days. Next resupply will be in Stratton Maine. There I will resupply for the following three or four days. That way I don't have to carry as much food in my pack. It will be tough enough going through the southern part of Maine without the extra burden of excess food. Tomorrow morning I am going to have a seven course breakfast and then be hitting the trail by 9 AM. The first thing that will happen after breakfast will be to take a canoe ride across the Kennebec River. The Kennebec River is too wide to ford and the Main Appalachian Trail club offers a free canoe shuttle across the river which I will definitely take advantage of. Hopefully my boots will stay dry.","Pleasant Mt Shelter

Let me try to get you caught up. It's been three days since I left Caratunk Maine and no service till here in Stratton, Maine. 
Sept 14, Thursday. 17.9 miles.After leaving the Hostel in Caratunk, at 9 am, I was able to get the water taxi across the Kennebec river. Yes, it did have a white blaze in the bottom of the canoe. Only took five minutes. After crossing I would be able to move at a good pace since the terrain was relatively flat. This day was one of my better days for hiking and certainly most scenic as I was able to follow a river for about 8 miles. At times the river would narrow down and turn into a beautiful cascading water fall. Spent the night at West Cary Pond Lean-to. No one was at the lean-to at 5 o'clock when I arrived. Was almost asleep at seven, when five young people showed up at the shelter. Next thing I knew I could smell a strange odor in the air as they were smoking something. They were very rude and inconsiderate of people trying to rest. Head a very restless nights sleep.
Sept 15, Friday. 12.6 miles.One of the young people had an alarm set to go off at 6 am and it did! I was truly upset, so I got up and started throwing my stuff around, not worrying about trying to be quiet, and then left at 6:30 without saying a word. Now, Maine is starting to show her true grit. ROCKS! Today was spent rock hopping and gaining elevation. Now at Safford Notch camping for the night. It actually had a wooden platform for my tent. Will have a better nights rest here tonight.
Sept 16, Sat 10.4 miles.
Woke up this morning rested and excited to tackle the mountain that lays before me and contains Byron Avery's name at the peak. It will be a 1500 foot climb and a challenging one at that. Most of the two miles up would require the use of all fours and my legs would become fatigued after an hour of climbing. The legs are strong for hiking but not for Mountain climbing. Once on top I was told that I should be able to look straight north and see the last view of Katahdin. Unfortunately, due to a lot of smog, I was not able to see very far. Nonetheless the views were beautiful. By the end of the day I will have crossed the Bigelow mountains west peak, Avery peak and the North and South Horns peaks. Coming down from the mountain tops proved to be just as difficult as going up. Again I would have to use all fours and be careful not to fall forward as I would roll quite a ways, not to mention getting hurt. After getting down I had a 2 mile hike on Level terrain to get to Highway 27 where I would then hitchhike into Stratton Maine, and arrive at the Stratton motel at about 5 PM. After eating a hearty steak supper and consuming a couple of beers I returned to the motel room to take a hot bath and have a good nights rest.
Sept 17, Sunday
Today I decided on a zero day. Laid around the motel room and now watching football. Tonight it's the Packers.
Mileage should read 1721.4 total at this point. Should have 468 miles to go to finish. I hope my math is correct.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578008,"Sept. 18. This morning I managed to get a shuttle back to the trail at around 7:30. This would be another one of those tough days of long uphills and steep downs. The first uphill would last for 5.2 miles with some almost straight up sections. I reached the top of North Crocker Mt. around noon so decided to enjoy the view and eat lunch. Then it was a half mile down followed by another half mile up followed by a 2.2 mile section where I was forced to use all fours to climb down without falling. Found a nice Campsite by the Carrabassett River and am now enjoying a supper of Ramen Noodles. Totals for today: 8.4 miles. I thought I would give you my routine for when I get to camp for the night. First thing would be to find a near level spot to pitch the tent. Take off my pack and take out several items in order to get at the three pieces of the tent. That would be the ground tarp, the screened tent and the rain fly. Next I would set up the tent which takes about five minutes. Next, blow up sleeping pad, (air mattress ), and place in tent, followed by unloading the rest of the pack to get at the sleeping bag. The sleeping bag is packed on the bottom which I pull out and lay on top of the pad. After that comes the placement of misc. items in the tent. Every item has its place in the tent and will always be in that spot. Easy to find in the dark if necessary. Now that the tent is erected and equipped the next chore would be to collect water from what ever source is available. I usually fill my 3 liter bag and and carry it back to camp. Once back at camp I will set up my stove, decide what to have for supper and place the correct amount of water in my pot, start the stove and bring the water to a boil before adding the mixture. While waiting for the water to boil, (needs to boil one minute to purify), I will filter water into my water bottle and mix up my drink of choice which is usually lemonade. Now that the pot is boiling I would add my ingredients for supper, boil for 7 minutes and enjoy a relaxing meal. After that wash dishes, dry, pack the cook kit away, brush teeth and crawl into the tent and into the sleeping bag. Once in for the night I would take time to look at tomorrow's plan, write down notes and mileage and do a blog if I have service. If no service then I write in my notes, on my phone, and would copy and paste later into the AT journal the next time I have service. Then it's a potty break and lights out. Good night to all.

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578192,"Sept. 21. Have not had service for a few days so will now catch up. Sept. 19, found me waking up and after breakfast the first thing to do was to cross the river Carrabassett. When I say cross I actually mean to ford the river. You just wade out and hope the current is not so strong as to wipe you off your feet. Some rivers actually have a rope strung between two trees over the river.  Luckily the river was low, so it was only a matter of hopping from rock to rock. After that it was a straight up climb for 2.5 miles. After that climb the terrain wasn't all together to bad. I think I let my guard down because about 11 am while walking on a level part of the trail I managed to catch my right toe on a small rock barely sticking out of the ground. The rock was big enough to keep my foot from moving so down I went only to hit the ground next to another rock that seemed to want to kiss my cheek, and it did. Result is a very sore and bruised cheek and a good looking black eye. Arrived at Poplar Ridge Shelter at 5 pm, had supper and asleep by 7pm. This shelter was the place that a hiker by the name of Inch Worm was last seen alive on July 22, 2013. There is a memorial plaque of her here in the shelter. It seems she had her picture taken there, by another hiker, and then left towards the next shelter never to be seen again till 2015. Her remains were discovered, accidentally, by a hiker who left the trail to relieve himself. She evidently did the same thing but never found her way back to the trail. She lived 28 days before succumbing to the elements. Her name was Gerry Largay, age 66, from the state of Washington. RIP.September 20th. Woke up at 6am to a very foggy morning. It was so thick that it seemed that it had rained all night. Took till noon for the fog to lift. By noon I had climbed over 1200 feet to the summit of Saddleback Mt. and the views were worth the added effort that it required to climb there. You could see 360 degrees and it was gorgeous. We were above tree line. Today the rocks and roots were quite slippery and made walking that much more difficult. It would prove to be a long day of climbing rocks and walking gingerly. Only did 10.7 miles but seemed like 20. Ended up at Highway 4, about 10 miles from a town called Rangeley. Now, being 6 pm, I decided to hitch into town for the night and found a motel called Lake and Town motel. Thinking about a zero tomorrow.Sept 21. Yep, took a zero today. Needed to resupply for the push to get to Gorham as well as need a shower, laundry and a hair cut. Nice to just relax today. Tomorrow I'll be back at it. The terrain will be more difficult from now on till I get thru the Whites. Still living my dream. Sometimes I wonder if I'm not living a nightmare! I am still enjoying the adventure though. .","Stratton, ME

The picture above shows what type of trail I have been walking on. The picture shows exactly the way the trails are here in Maine. The roots and rocks make hiking a slow process as well as dangerous. That is one reason that I keep falling. One miss step and down you go. You just hope you don't hit anything that will hurt you. Also forgot to mention the other day while hiking up to Saddleback Mt., I heard a noise off to my right about 10 yards away. I stopped to get a better look through the trees and was able to see a huge bull moose. He had no idea I was there. I did take a few photos of him, but he wouldn't smile for me. That would be my 4th moose siteing since I've been in Maine.
Hiked 14 miles and only fell once today. The terrain was mostly level allowing a little bit better pace. They say that the southern part of Maine is much like the Whites and maybe a little worse. I guess we will see. Temps are on the rise which I guess is unusual for this time of year. Leaves are starting to turn, and I'm looking forward to hiking through the colors. Should have some phenomenal views.
Sept 23
Hiked 12.1 today through some pretty tough mountains. Two major ups and downs. The ups are nice because you get to climb up and your leaning into the Mt. But coming down is quite a bit harder as I always feel like I'll miss step and tumble forward down the incline. Consequently I move much slower going down those steep declines. I do enjoy the views though. Leaves are now about 40% turned. I do think that these mountains are an extension of the Whites. There definitely has been a change in terrain from a few days ago. Certainly more rocks and and bigger size. I'm now having to use all fours to go up some of these mountains. Also I think summer has returned, along with the 80's and 90's temps.
Sept 24
Took to the trail early today to avoid climbing in the heat. Expected temps near 90. Hiked 11.1 miles but now the mileage will go down a little because of the rough terrain. When I came out to the East B Road, there was a van parked on the side of the road waiting to pick up 2 hikers and shuttle them into Andover Maine , to a hostel called PineEllis. I asked if they minded if I were to ride into town with them. They agreed and so came to the PineEllis, Hostel. I think I wimped out in light of the heat today. Got into the hostel and the first thing I did was to shower. It was a cold shower, my choice, as I was so hot. My clothes were totally wet so it felt good to get out of them, shower and put on some dry clothes. After the shower, I washed my wet clothes and then hit the general store for a bite to eat. After that came the Packers football. What a way to spend the evening on such a hot day. Tomorrow I will slack pack ten miles to Grafton Notch and resume my normal hiking on Tuesday. Temps tomorrow will again be in the 90s. 
I will figure out mileage tomorrow to get the figures correct. Again I find it difficult to figure out exact mileage except for the dailies. Should be near 1932.00","

Also bought some resupplies. They open at 5 am to serve breakfast so came over for a great breakfast. Also I had to order my favorite, cheese, egg and sausage on a Kaiser bun. I saved that for lunch today. I ate my lunch on top of Baldpate Mt. at 3,810 feet and enjoyed the panaramic view. Again the weather has been hot but still enjoying the fine fall weather.

They open at 5am and have a really good breakfast special of coffee, 2 eggs, 2 sausage patties and 2 French toast. After breakfast I was shuttled back to Grafton Notch where I started hiking at 7:30. I knew today would be a hard one as it's still very hot out plus I have a 3 mile, 1500 foot climb right away. Once I got up to the top though the views were fantastic. It just seemed like I was in slow motion today. The ups were very steep and the downs were even steeper. All I was able to do was 7.0 miles. Tomorrow I will wake up and do the Mahoosuc Notch which will require about three hours of rock scrambling to cover 1 mile of ground. AWOL says this can be the hardest 1 mile on the whole Appalachian Trail or it can be the most fun 1 mile of the Appalachian Trail. Since I like a good challenge I will look at this as being the most fun 1 mile of the Appalachian Trail. Tomorrow we will see. Sept 27. Did the ""Notch"" this morning. It was actually fun and challenging, but boy am I beat. Took over three hours to get through the boulders that make up the Mahoosuc Notch. The picture above was done in the Notch. Black Sheep would have enjoyed that challenge as he has done a lot of rock climbing himself. There were a couple of times where I wondered if I would ever make it through the boulder field without getting lost or getting hurt.The rest of the day was spent going up one mountain after another. Finally be 6:45 I came to my destination for the night. It's called Carlo Col Shelter and campground. Distance traveled today was only 7.1 miles due to the difficult terrain.

Many hikers commented on my new style of head gear, but I felt it wasn't becoming for me so will replace it with a baseball cap of some type.

By the way the girls trail names are Little Elk and Little Duffer. Anyway, while we were landing the canoes on a point of land to take a break, Peter was the first out of their canoe, or should I say the first to try to get out of the canoe. Suffice to say he manage to get one leg over the side of the canoe but it never found bottom in the shallow water. In his attempt to reach bottom he tipped the canoe and ended up falling out of the canoe in a not too graceful manner. Thus Big Dumper. I LOVE All my family including our ""adopted girls"".

Met up with Russ and Jo, friends of my daughter and her husband, for breakfast. We had a great morning together talking over breakfast. Then they were able to give me a ride to Pinkham Notch so I could check on getting gloves and hat for my climb thru the Whites. Otherwise I just laid low. Had a steak supper at Mr. Pizza.
October 1st.I decided to slack pack from Pinkham Notch back to Gorham, a total of 21.1 miles. I think I was feeling so good after a relaxing day that I could do that stretch without a problem. I was wrong! I have had some bad days of hiking but this takes the cake. It started out by waking up Sunday morning with a sore back. Nothing unusual about that and all I do is stretch out to loosen up the back muscles. I have my whole life had a problem with my lower back. Evidently I have a bulging disc back there. Anyway, every now and then I will do something to throw my back out of whack. Then I stay in bed and live on Aleve for about a week till it starts to feel better. After a quick breakfast, Paul gave me a ride out to Pinkham Notch. 8 am, my first challenge was all rock and I started hiking north straight up for 2000 feet. Just after starting my climb I realized that my back was getting worse. Now I had to decide to continue or quit and go back to the hostel. Quitting was not really a possibility because Paul would not be available as he left to drive 3 hours to visit his aunt in Massachusetts. She fell and broke her hip. I decided to take 3 Advil and continue slowly. As the Advil started to work, I was able to increase my pace after reaching the top of the mountain. I was told before starting the hike that it would take 12 hours to complete. I started at 8 am which means I'll be hiking till 8 pm. I did bring food, water, jacket and a headlamp for the night portion of the hike. I was well prepared except was not figuring the lower back issue. Also was not prepared for the strenuous ups and downs. This day I would climb up and down 6 mountains that were over 4000 feet or more. It was a good day to hike as the temps were in the low 50s. There was a hard frost last night. By 6 pm I was still 8 miles from my pickup point and the sun sets at 6:10 pm. Started using my headlamp at 6:30 and now, because it was dark, my pace slows considerably. Finally arrived at the parking lot at 10:45. What a relief. Got back to the hostel, took a long hot shower and in bed by midnight. I'm very thankful for my knowledge of hiking and ability to hike at night.

Have taken one Aleve tablet about every 8 hours and can move around pretty well considering all and all. Usually I'm flat on my back for a good 3 days before I can start to get around without too much pain. Also today I was able to send home my hiking shoes as I have purchased another new pair, these being my fourth for the hike. The old ones may not have much tread left on them but will be good enough to mow lawn in. Also was able to enjoy a little nap in the afternoon. Tuesday October 3rd.I left the hostel with Paul at 7 am. He drove me back to Pinkham Notch so I could continue hiking south towards Massachusetts. I hiked from the Notch up Mt.

Hiked 7.8 miles today. Most of it was up hill. The last 2 miles was above tree line and nothing but rocks to walk on which was hard on my back.

Oh well, as a friend of mine says, ""just walk it off"". As the day progressed so did the pain on that bone. I climbed Mt. Washington and was amazed at the scenery when at the top. Mt. Washington is known for the most sever weather in the United States. Winds have been clocked at over 230 mph. The weather conditions up there can change in a matter of minutes. It was an awesome place. It's height is 6,288 feet and you can see forever. But at the same time it was a culture shock with all the hustle bustle of civilization. You can drive up there, hike up there or take the Cog Railroad up there. Needless to say I walked. I did my picture at the summit and then went into the concession area and sat down next to two couples that were visiting the mountain. One couple is from NH and the other couple is from Hawaii and visiting the first couple. They were so kind to buy me lunch as they could see how hungry and thirsty I was. Thanks again to them for their generosity. Soon after that I hit the trial down from the mountain as I heard the winds were to reach 100 miles per hour that evening. Made my way down about a mile and a half to an AMC Hut called Lake Of The Clouds. The Hut is closed but there is a basement room for hikers if needed. It's called ""The Dungeon"". It's like a prison cell. The room was 12 feet by 12 feet, one little window and a big iron door that creaks when being opened. Smells musty and feels damp. But with the approaching weather it will be good to be inside. As I went to bed at 7 pm, it was starting to rain and winds were picking up.
Oct 5 Thursday  Woke up at 7am from a restless nights sleep in the Dungeon. The wind whipped all night. Some rain as well. Heard the next day that winds were approaching 100 miles per hour at the top of mount Washington. We might have had 60 mph. This Hut is also closed except for a couple of workers closing the place up for the winter. They let us use the restrooms and get water before they shut the water off the next day. The morning was very windy, foggy and spitting rain. I started out walking in full rain gear and fighting to stay upright against the strong winds. Today my plan was to hike to Mizpah Hut which is open. Once I got to the Hut, I learned that they were expecting a school group of 50 kids to spend the night there. I decided to continue hiking to a road crossing about another 5 miles away. Part of the trail came up to cliffs that overlooked a valley 1000 feet below. Beautiful views but a little scary at the same time. Suffice to say I stayed as far back as I could from the edge. I stealth camped between a river and highway 302. 
Oct 6 Friday Did some doctoring this morning on my sore ankle and on my little toe on my left foot. The toenail is getting ready to fall off and yesterday when changing socks, ( I always change socks at lunch time to prevent blisters from damp socks), I accidentally snagged the nail and ripped it half off. So I put some Neosporin on it and a band aid and also wrapped my ankle bone with some athletic KT tape. Left camp at 9 am just as it started to rain. I stopped walking and put on my rain pants and jacket. After an hour of walking in the rain it stopped so I took off the rain gear. Hiked for about another hour when it started to rain again. So again I put on my rain gear only to take it off after about half an hour. At 2 pm I reached Zealand Hut, which is an AMC run Hut. These are nice buildings that you can stay in, for pay, and then you get a full dinner, breakfast and a bunk to sleep in and a bathroom. I can regroup and plan out my strategy for the next couple of days. Looks like I'll hike 8 miles tomorrow and end up at Galehead Hut. I will try to use as many of the ""Huts"" as possible till I'm out of the White Mountains.Bad news!!!! Just heard of some wildfires near Kinsman Ridge, ( a couple of days away), that I may have to deal with. We'll see when I get closer to that area. By the way, for the people worried about my diet, I am eating better with more protein in my diet. I feel great. My wounds are healing and back feels a lot better.Sat. October 7. I still have no service so what I do is record my journal in notes, on my phone, and when I have good service I'll send these all out together. Today I hiked 7 miles to Galehead Hut. It's another AMC run Hut. I started at 7:30 and arrived here at 12:30. Nice to arrive when I did as it has started to rain and the fog is settling in. The rocks were wet which makes the hiking slower, but better safe than sorry. The Hut is full, ( capacity of 36 ), with weekend hikers and so is quite noisy. Had a wonderful supper and am now ready for bed. Tomorrow weather is suppose to be rain, fog and windy. Not good to enjoy scenery. Also will be going quite slowly. Will need to resupply soon.By the way, Black Sheep, you'd enjoy climbing these mountains in the Whites. All rock and many of the peaks I go over are well above 4000 feet.Need to go now. Raining again.","

The picture above was from Mt. Washington and shows me hiking up the mountainside and a cog railroad train in the background carrying tourist to the top. The train engine pushes the passenger car up the mountain. The people on the train have no idea how hard I had worked to get up there. 
Woke to to the rhythmic sounds of petter patter on the tent this morning. It started around 4 and continued ALL day. At one point it turned into a downpour that lasted 30 minutes. I had to walk three miles down the mountain to a visitor center where I would have cell service. There I would call ""The Notch Hostel"" and arrange for shuttle pickup to take me to their place to dry out. On the way to the hostel we made a detour to McDonalds for a lunch time meal. 
Here at the hostel now and have showered, did laundry, and resupplied all while the rain continued. It is now 10 pm and still raining. Tomorrow I will attempt an 8 mile walk followed on Wednesday by a 9 miler. The rocks are likely to be pretty slippery, and the trail will be full of water. Should be interesting.","Liberty Springs Campground

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579396,"Tuesday, October 10th. Had a very relaxing evening at the ""Notch Hostel"" here in Woodstock, NH. Last night. Met an interesting hiker from Michigan by the name of Kelsey. She's 25 years old and works for an ocean dredging company. They go to ocean front areas that have been destroyed by hurricanes and study the ocean area and make proposals to change the ocean front properties so the homes will be better able to withstand other hurricanes, but still working to protect the natural aspects of the ocean. After breakfast this morning, ""Bookie"" drove me and another hiker back up to the trail head where we could continue our treks. Shortly after starting I came across a vast area of blackened earth. I had heard there was a wildfire in the area and that we may not be able to hike through that area if it was burning. Luckily with the help of firefighters and the rains, we've been having, the fires were almost out. At least enough that I was able to hike through the burned over areas. Some spots were still smoldering as I walked by. Today the sun actually showed itself and it was a pleasant day temperature wise. Wish I could say that it was a pleasant hike, but I cannot. There were a lot of PUDs, (pointless ups and downs), that took quite a bit of energy and time to complete. Only traveled 7 miles in as many hours. I arrived at Eliza Brook Shelter at 3 pm, and decided to call it a day and relax the rest of the afternoon. Tomorrow will be another grueling day as I attempt to cross over the Kinsman Mountain Range. There will be a lot of almost vertical climbing. North and South Kinsman Mts., are again over four thousand feet high. I'll be glad to be done climbing these 4000 footers. Good Night.","

I traversed that ridge line last Sunday, in 70 mph winds, fog, sleet and rain and never saw the views that could have been spectacular. I had a hard time just seeing the next cairn as my guide. Mileage today was about 10 miles total. Started the day at 6 am, by eating a healthy breakfast and hitting the trail at 7 am. Followed a beautiful river, full of little cascading water falls, for the first mile before heading away from the river and toward climbing straight up about 1500 feet on rock faces. It started out sunny but then the winds came and the sky clouded over. Before long I had to put my puffy on to keep warm. Climbing like I was, requires total concentration and consumes a lot of energy not to mention time consumption. I just like to take my time to make sure every step is the right foothold and not to slip. Finally after about an hour I broke out of the trees and into the open alpine area above tree line. What a view! It all seems worth it when you break out at the top and can see forever. I found a nice area in the sun for a mid morning snack. Time to give these old feet a rest. After that I headed down the other side of South Kinsman only to go up again to North Kinsman, both above 4000 feet. Finally I headed down to Lonesome Lake Hut. This is another Hut run by the AMC people. I stopped in for a bowl of soup and coffee before continuing down the mountain. Next stop would be the Visitor Center at highway 3. There I was able to get some chicken tenders and fries to eat while I called ""Bookie"", from ""The Notch Hostel"", to come and pick me up so I could spend one more night at the hostel. Tomorrow I will climb my last 4000 footer.","Elisa Brook Shelter

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579555,"October 12, Thursday. Actual mileage today was only 8.4 due to the rugged terrain. The reason the number is higher on the tally above is to catch up to the actual mileage that I have walked so far. Left the hostel at 7:30 and was dropped off at the parking lot for hiking up to Moosalickee Mountain. The first part of this days hike was basically straight up. It would be 12:30 by the time I broke out of the tree line and summited Moosalicki at 4802 feet. Beautiful 360 degree views. I sat down out of the wind to eat my lunch while many other hikers showed up. After a few pictures I headed south and down off the mountain. Now it was all down hill for the next 4 miles. The first two miles were very steep boulder covered and slow going. By the time I had reached Jeffers Shelter my knees were hurting and legs were a little unsteady.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579557,"October 14, Saturday. Walked a total of 14.7 miles today and stealth camped next to a beaver pond. Today was another good day of hiking as the terrain is starting to level out a little more. Also I hiked with three other people and their yellow lab for most of the afternoon. There are quite a few people who are hiking South on the Appalachian Trail now. They ,like myself, have done a flip somewhere along the way. Tomorrow I'll be out of New Hampshire once I cross the Connecticut River at Hanover, New Hampshire. A new problem has cropped up during my hiking in the last couple of days. That problem would be leaves falling on the trail covering up the trail so that I cannot follow a natural path. Also all the leaves make going downhill slippery compounded by the fact that there are a lot of acorns in areas where there are oak trees. The acorns become like marbles when you're going downhill. I have fallen a couple of times,gently, due to these acorns and leaves. Most hikers have. Usually your legs go out from under you and you land on your pack.","

The leaves down here have turned 100% and a lot of the leaves have fallen making it slippery for a walk on the slopes. Unfortunately the pictures I have taken of the woods, do not show the golden glow that existed when I took the picture. A friend of mine once commented on how beautiful it was too be in the woods in the fall when all the leaves have turned color. He said ""it was like hunting in a golden room"", and I am reminded of that every day now as I walk in sunlight through the trail. The smell of fall is in the air, and I love the rustling of the leaves under foot as I walk down the trail. Today I made it to Hanover New Hampshire the last town in New Hampshire. Tomorrow I'll cross the Connecticut River and be in Vermont. Looking forward to a little bit more Level land for hiking. After checking into a hotel for the night, I went to a place called the Canoe Club for supper.

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579560,"Oct. 15, Sunday. I am trying to send out another journal report today. We'll see how it works. While hiking today I came across a stream that had a little wooden bridge across it. I thought this would be a nice place to stop and have a break, and filter water for the next couple hours of hiking. While sitting there on the bridge I've befriended a ruffed grouse. He seemed to enjoy my company as we carried on a conversation for 15 to 20 minutes. At one time he even jumped up onto my back while I bent over to get water out of the stream. I felt sad when I started to walk away as he started running down the trail after me for about 50 yards. I finally picked up the pace and got out of sight so that he could not follow any further. I sorta miss the little guy. As he walked up my legs or around me he would be making short little vocal sounds as if to ask ""can I go home with you?""","

It's getting more difficult to hike through all the leaves on the trail. Met a group of 5th or 6th graders out for a field trip. I was asked to talk to the kids about my hike for just five minutes. 30 minutes later I was on my way again. Not too many people on the trail today. Also came across trail magic left by the school kids at the bottom of a mountain. A cooler filled with apples, candy and bottled water.

It was a beautiful scene but added another element of danger to my hike. The problem is that the leaves now fall into the path, as well as all around the trail, making the distinction between the trail and just woods very difficult. Also what is under the leaves? All those leaves make going down hill very slippery. I feel as though I'm walking on egg shells not knowing what's under the leaves. I did get lost this morning after leaving the shelter but kept my wits and landmarks about me and found the AT after about 15 minutes of bushwhacking. I basically knew where I was so I wasn't worried. It was another beautiful day for ""living my dream"". I walked another 16 miles to a town called Killington, VT. Here there is a hostel called Mountain Meadows Lodge, where I spent the night. Also will resupply for three more days of hiking. That should get me to Manchester Center, VT.

As I walked in the beautiful glow of early sun I could see it would be a challenging day. There were mud holes and puddles of water throughout the trail all day long. Also, due to the previous storms, there were trees and limbs laying across the trail, which made negotiating the trail a real challenge. And to make matters worse, at 10 AM the rains moved in. It rained till 3 pm. After the rain stopped the fog moved in and the temperatures dropped. As the day progressed I realized I would have to walk a quicker pace in order to get done before dark. Although I had my headlamp with me I care not to hike in darkness if at all possible. During my hike today my boots became progressively wetter and muddier. At one time I stepped off of a rock and into knee deep mud. Also crossing rivers became a real challenge as all rivers have risen due to the increased rain over the past three and four days. At one time I almost went for a swim as I slipped on a rock in the middle of the river. I finished my hike today at 6:15 in the parking lot next to Highway number nine.

By the time I reached Cheshire, MA. I found myself totally soaked and starting to get cold. For the last four days it has been very wet and rainy and this makes it difficult to hike at a normal pace. One has to be careful not to slip on wet rocks or roots as well as being careful walking on the large mass of leaves that collect in the depression of the eroded trail. These leaves tend to slide one on top of the others, creating a very slippery situation. All of these hazards slow me down quite a bit. The terrain is favorable to hike at a good pace but can’t. Now the weather is expected to turn colder, but little rain till next Monday. Hopefully I will be done walking by then. Finn is getting pretty good at getting to each of my pickup points. She loves her Garmin in her Subaru. Kind a fun to be able to spend time every night with the love of my life and then spent all day living my dream.","North Adams

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580366,"November 7th. Tuesday.Finn and I are staying in a Best Western here in Pittsfield, MA. We are using this hotel as a base of operations while I try to finish this endeavor. Today I planned to hike about 18 miles toward Lee,MA. At 11 am, Finn sent me a message saying that the road, she was to pick me up on, is closed. She wanted to find the location of the road before the pickup time to make sure she could find it when 5 o’clock rolled around later. We decided to change the pickup to MA. 20. After realizing I wouldn’t be hiking the total distance of 18 miles, but rather 4 miles short, I thought maybe Finn would like to hike the AT with me for about 6 miles. I contacted her and made arrangements to meet in Dalton, MA., at noon. We met up and hiked together to a new trailhead, where I had made arrangements with a shuttle driver to meet us and take us back to Dalton where she parked the car. She really hiked quite well considering the terrain and not having hiked since the Smokies and, yes, we still made our shuttle time appointment. Finn hiked a total of 6.4 miles. I hiked that plus my morning mileage for a total of 15.7 miles. Tomorrow will start a cool down in temperatures and possible snow. We'll see how tomorrow turns out.","

Slept in till 6:30 am. Checked the weather channel for current conditions and found it was 24 degrees and 1 inch of snow. It was a cold start to what would be a beautiful fall day or more like a winter day. Finn took me out to the trail head, where we finished yesterday, and I started hiking at 8 am. Only saw two other hikers today and they were only out for the day. Finn picked me up at 1:30 pm, after hiking 12.6 miles. I decided to go back to the hotel, shower and take a long nap. After checking mileage I see I have only 50 miles to go. Looks like I’ll be finishing by Sunday night. SOooooo looking forward to then. We ate at a small local Italian restaurant before retiring for the night. Finn enjoyed her new found toy- the GPS function in her car. Now she can enter the GPS coordinates for the pick up location and not worry about getting lost. She definitely is becoming more independent. Im glad we are finishing this adventure together.","Blotz Road

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580417,"November 9, Thursday. Another day of typical fall weather here in the east. Sunny and a high of 50 degrees. The plan was to walk from Lee, MA., to a road crossing 12.6 miles away but like many of these best made plans things change. Chris dropped me off at the trailhead at 7:30 and I slowly walked up my first hill. After 15 minutes I had to shed my puffy jacket and stocking hat due to the warmth my body was putting out. By noon I also took off my pant legs of my zip- offs. It was indeed a nice day for hiking. I reached the trailhead by 1 pm and called Finn to change the pickup point to another 9 miles south of the previously arranged site. She was able to enter the GPS coordinates into her Garmin and drive to that trailhead and arrived at 4:30. I arrived at 4:45. I would have been there earlier except, about 6 miles from the trailhead. I ran into Cash Money whom Black Sheep and I met in the Hundred Mile Wilderness back in early September . His plan was to hike to Harpers Ferry but had decided to call it quits due to the cold weather. Cant say as I blame him. Tomorrow they are predicting record lows and 40-50 mph winds.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580418,"Friday, November 10. Bitterly cold today. Slept in till 7am and checked the weather channel. 20 degrees and 40 mph wind. Chill factor in the low teens. Ain’t no way I will go out and freeze my beautiful little toes in that weather. Instead I would spend the day with Finn and do a little sightseeing in this beautiful area of New England. Every time we got out of the car we were reminded of how bitter it was outside. Later this afternoon we took a nap and hit a popular restaurant in the area for supper. Tomorrow the wind will diminish and temps will slowly rebound to 30 degrees. I will start walking about 8 am, totally bundled up in all the clothes I have with me, and hopefully will stay warm. At least the sun will be shining.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580447,"Saturday, November 11. Well folks, it’s coming to an end. Today I woke up to the realization of hiking only 13 miles and that tomorrow will be the last day of this grand adventure. Today started out at a record low temperature of 11 degrees and slowly crawled up to 28 with sunlight and little wind. Tomorrow will be my last full day to walk. The hike will take me back to Salisbury, CT, where Black Sheep and I did my flip to Maine, way back in September. Temps will be a record low again, but should warm up to 40 by noon. While I’m out hiking, Finn is checking out the towns in the area. Usually she goes to a coffee shop and enjoys a good latte and reads her book till it’s time to leave and meet me at the trailhead. I do try to be off the trail by 4:30 so as to avoid walking in the dark. She has done an excellent job of finding the pick up spots and being on time and has learned how to use the Garmin in her car.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580634,"I was able to finish my thru hike on Sunday November 12th at 5 pm in Salisbury, CT. This was the town that Black Sheep and I hiked to at the end of August before I flipped and traveled to Northern Maine. Then I started hiking south towards Salisbury, CT. The weather has turned cold as I knew it would. I wasn’t expecting the record lows though and 50 mph winds. Because of the wind chill on Friday, November 10th, I decided to zero that day and then finish up hiking on Saturday and Sunday. It was still very cold both days but the wind was non existent. A high of 34 on Sat. and 36 on Sun. The terrain on Sunday was quite rugged and it took a little longer to cover the 17 miles than I expected. I made it to Salisbury by 5 pm. Then Finn and I drove a day and a half to Marion, VA. to finish the 5 mile section that I missed back in August. Tuesday November 14, was a travel day and we stopped in Harper’s Ferry, at the conservancy, to register my thru hike and make it official. Also had to buy a few souvenirs from my adventure. Wednesday we arrived at Marion around 9 am. We found the section I missed and started to hike about 10 am and told Finn she could meet me at the other end at about two pm. It was a nice day to finish this section, and head for home. On the way back to Wisconsin, we decided to stop and visit Papa Choo Choo and Elsa Lin in Indiana. Spent a wonderful day and a half with them. Then, on Thursday, we traveled to “The Farm” where we met up with one of our former employees. A great time to reminisce on the past. Next we visited Cherry Girl and Sir William in Cherry Valley, IL and then continued on home. Arrived at 10 pm back home. Some dear friends, Boo and Willie wanted to make sure we didn’t get lost, so they put up a white blaze on a stick and stuck it in our front yard. Then some other friends brought over a bouquet of balloons that welcomed me home. Heart felt thanks to all. Now the plan will be to recuperate and then look at statistics and evaluate all the experiences that have occurred over the last 8.5 months. I would like to express my sincere THANKS to all of the people that followed me on this adventure. It’s been memorable!!!!. I hope I was able to give you some idea of what it was like to be on the trail with me. If you would like to contact me at any time about anything trail related you can email me at buckleysportsimage@charter.net
This AT Journal site will remain active for about a year and I will, now and then, put out a post with info about the hike when I have time. Have a safe and joyous holiday season. Huckleberry.","

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582778,"Thursday, February 8th. Well it’s been four months since leaving the trail and I’m beginning to miss it. I have managed to adapt to civilization but I do have to admit that life was simpler on the trail. On the other hand life is more enjoyable with all the creature comforts of life at home. It’s very cold here in Wisconsin now and I am glad not to be out hiking in it.         I would like to get back to walking but will need to wait till after June. Finn and I have agreed to babysit till Mid June. As you may or may not remember, in August I left the trail for the birth of my daughters first child. On the 19th of August, she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, and named her Hadley. So now Finn and I will spend the weekends in Eau Claire, WI. and then spend the week living with Peter and Jenny, in St. Paul, MN., taking care of Hadley. It’s been quite the experience taking care of a little one again. A lot of things I experience with Hadley, I don’t remember when we were raising our two kids. Being a grandparent and retired definitely has its benefits. I’m currently working on statistics from the trail and will get them out to you later. Till then enjoy the winter as spring is just around the corner.","

After 50 years of marriage, we look back feeling blessed in so many ways—
We as a couple love each other more deeply now than when we shared our wedding vows.
We have been blessed with caring, loving children and their true companions and three grandchildren that fill our hearts and lives with pride, love and hope.
We have friends that continue to enrich our lives daily.
We have joy and purpose. 
We trust in a loving God who has created a world of beauty if we only take the time to look for it. 
As we begin our journey on the Camino we hope to learn more about ourselves and grow to love others. 
In all honesty, we don’t know what we will learn or how we will grow...just that we will.  After all—we are on a pilgrimage
