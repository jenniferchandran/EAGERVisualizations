Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553175,"Well, it has been three years since Sparkles has been on the trail. The last time we hiked together she was 4 years old and we hiked from Springer Mountain to Woody Gap. I realized back then that it was a bit much for her, although she handled it really well, and so decided I would wait to start hiking with her again until she got a little older. Today she is a sassy little first-grader who loves her stuffed animals, the color pink, learning, and taking walks in the woods. She gets mad when she sees developers cutting down trees, and says the Lorax would not be happy. She's stoked about heading out on ""adventures"" this year, and I'm stoked to have a new hiking partner join me on the trail. Obviously, I will have to cut down on my daily mileage and speed, but for me it's a fair trade-off to have her by my side. The plan is to try and do 2-3 overnight hikes of around 15 miles each during later winter/spring. This should be enough to gauge her speed and stamina while keeping it fun for her. If that goes well then around the beginning of June we'll pick up where I've left off on my section hiking and do a week headed north from Bear's Den Hostel in Virginia as our big hike of the year. Come September we'll get her mom and brother out to join us for a hike in the Grayson Highlands as a family, and depending on weather maybe add a couple weekends in the fall, weather and time permitting. I've decided to track our mileage together as she picks up her section hike of the trail. I have my own mileage which I'm tracking, but to be honest my personal accomplishment isn't the biggest thing of interest to me. I want to keep this journal for her to read as she gets older. My goal is to write about our experience, and to write about the experience of hiking with a child. Backpacking with kids can present unique challenges that I'm happy to share here for anyone that might want to read. Feel free to come along or don't, we'll be here anyways.","Woody Gap

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553177,"So, I haven't bought new gear in a few years and decided to sell some of the old to make way for the new. New stuff for me, and all new stuff for her. The first joy of hiking with children is that they are still growing which means new gear every couple of years. Hopefully this just means clothes and shoes...but it occasionally means a big ticket item as well. This year saw a need to buy all new, except for her hydration bladder and sleeping pad. I'll go on record now and say I refuse to carry my expedition size backpack. As a result, I went and bought an Osprey Atmos 65. I've always been an Osprey guy, and normally hike with an Exos 58, but admitting I will have to carry Sparkles food and possibly a couple extra odds and ends, the Exos suspension will not be beefy enough for hiking with my daughter. The Atmos will give a little more room, but more importantly can handle the extra weight I may have to deal with. For Sparkles, she will be carrying the Osprey Ace 38. It adjusts so that it can grow with her (Sparkles is very petite), and it is big enough for her to carry her sleep system, clothing, and hydration bladder. To be honest, that is the most someone her age should carry and the Ace 38 is big enough to cover her needs. It also comes with a rain cover already contained in it's own little compartment.Where will we sleep? Well, at the age of four Sparkles slept in a tent one night and a shelter the next...however she has had three years to develop phobias, and so I'm interested to see what the seven year old version prefers. We're well prepared for both and I will either carry my Fly Creek 2 or Fly Creek 3. I need to set up the FC2 to see how much actual space we'll have in that tent before deciding. Either way the weight difference isn't that much, and I may lean towards the extra space which is always nice to have. This is another issue about hiking with kids, and that is privacy for children. Most hiker trash are good folk, but some can use the wrong language or smoke the wrong thing around shelters, and so I need to accept that depending on who arrives at a shelter, a tent may be a far more appropriate place to sleep for a little girl than the shelter.What will we sleep in? Sparkles just received a Big Agnes Little Red 15 degree bag. Like all Big Agnes, you need a sleeping pad, and this will keep her from killing me in her sleep, as she is prone to tossing and turning, as well as kicking and punching in her sleep. The Little Red is good up to a height of 4ft 5inches, although she's barely four feet tall, and I'm not sure I entirely buy that, but to find a kid's bag, synthetic and under two pounds is an incredible deal at $69. If she falls in love with backpacking then I may upgrade her to a Feathered Friends kid's bag which will be lighter but significantly more expensive, but may last her for several years. I, on the other hand, have gone and purchased a WM Terralite 25 degree bag, and I am in hiker love with it already. Plenty of space, top of the line quality, and I should be able to hike in just about any season I would want to with this new sleeping bag. As for the summer, I have an Old Montbell 7 superstretch with is my ideal summer bag...so papa is covered very nicely, but I could also carry the Terralite as a summer quilt if I wanted to.So, my big three will weigh in at:With Fly Creek UL2 - 8lb 10ozWith Fly Creek UL3 - 9lb 13ozA 1lb 3oz increase of weight may well be worth the extra tent space, but I still plan on seeing how cramped the UL2 will be with gear on the inside.","Home

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553180,"How does one get a 7 year old girl excited about backpacking? First, she already loves the outdoors, has a near inexhaustible supply of energy, and is already very competitive with herself in school and athletics. This sets up great groundwork for backpacking. I plan hikes that won't have tons of killer climbs and that may have things of interest for her to see and explore. I keep most hikes to 7-10 mile days with only one over night. This decreases the chance of a trip in bad weather or of her becoming exhausted by the trip. I also tell her she's in charge of how far we go each day, which gives her an important job on our trip. I want her to enjoy her time out, not resent or hate it. In addition, I have purchased her the map pictured in this post for her to hang on her bedroom door. She loves maps, and after each hike we do, we'll take a Sharpie and use it to draw whatever section we have just hiked. In this way she get's to see what she is completing every time she hikes. It gives visual evidence to her accomplishment which makes the event even more exciting for her young mind. Young kids need to be engaged, often times going from Point A to Point B isn't enough for them, but there needs to be things in between. A spring hike will include Overmountain Shelter, and the Balds that follow. We'll stay at Mountain Harbour as well. Our summer hike will include Harper's Ferry (a night in the Towne Inn), the Washington Monument, and after we finish hiking a possible visit to Antietam Battlefield, all to join the hike to her burgeoning interest in American history. Our fall family hike will be in the Grayson Highlands so that the kids can look forward to seeing ponies, among other things, at an age where it may be something they can't wait to share with their friends upon getting home.I know Sparkles is stoked to get out there because she talks about it quite a bit with her mom when I'm not around. In my house this is the true measure of importance. If either of my kids talk about something with mom over and over again then it is a ""big"" deal in their lives.Tying the hiking to other things of interest ensures a young child has something to look forward to after walking all day long, and it may foster that love of hiking we hope to instill as parents by positively reinforcing backpacking as something that can be adventurous for their young minds.","Home

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553435,"So...I came home from work Friday night with an eye towards the mild weather predicted for the weekend. With that in mind I spoke with the wife, and then asked Sparkles if she wanted to go for a walk this weekend. With a smile and nod she said yes, and with that I was on the phone looking for a shuttle from Unicoi to Hogpen Gap. After arranging a shuttle with Sally for 9am I went about pulling out gear and packing up for the hike. After dinner and a quick run to Target I didn't get to bed until almost midnight, but I figured walking the next day would keep me from being too tired.The drive up to Unicoi Gap was uneventful, and we didn't have to wait long for Sally to pick us up. We had a nice conversation on the way up to Hogpen Gap, and after a few minutes we were on our way up the trail.   The skies stayed relatively clear throughout the day, and as the temps climbed into the sixties we quickly found ourselves in t-shirts for the rest of the day's hike. Sparkles started out pretty strong, but begins to wain after the first four miles. In part, I think this was my fault. She is so petite that while her backpack fits her back, her hipbelt, even cinched all the way kept sliding down. We kept adjusting it every 15-30 minutes, but I will probably transfer most of her stuff to my pack tomorrow. The goal is for her to enjoy it out here, not to be miserable.We arrived at Low Gap Shelter around 1:30ish, got water. Love my new Grayl Filter, so easy to use, although it can start to hurt your hands. After water we ate some lunch while the little gal roamed around and explored to her heart's content. With about 1.5 miles left for the day we got going around 2:30.   Even with me having taken her sleeping bag, her pack continued to dig into her shoulders, but she still managed to keep a pace a little better than 1.5 MPH. She was lagging behind me about 50 yards, and as she got closer I could see she was had tears on her face. Her feet were hurting and it was obvious at 3:30pm she was done. As the gap has been my target destination I was fine with this. After a little hike down an old forest road we managed to find the water, filled up, and then went back so that I could set up the tent. I love my Fly Creek UL3. Packs up small, sets up easy, and plenty of space for two people. Once the tent was set up, she settled into her sleeping bag. I know some disdain it, but we had a good signal so I let her watch Netflix on the tablet. I figured she earned it, and being a little girl, a happy night should make for positive spirits in the morning. She watched her shows while I made dinner, and then we ate together before settling in to watch some shows together, and then played some checkers on the tablet. We called mom to say goodnight, and then I made some hot chocolate, even though it is still almost sixty degrees at 9:30pm. Just before bed I picked her up and showed her how bright the stars are far from the city. It made me smile to see the awe on her face, having never seen so many stars at once in the sky. It's moments like that which makes taking her out worth it.Tomorrow will be a rough day for her I think. the climb up Blue Mountain isn't an easy one. I'm hoping her feet feel better in the morning. I also plan on taking most of her stuff into my pack so all she has to carry is basically a pack with water. For now she's already burrowed into her sleeping bag, sound asleep. Time for me to get some sleep, but somehow I don't think I'll fall asleep as easily as she did.","Hogpen Gap
",Poplar Stamp Gap,"Jan 14, Sat",6
Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553480,"We woke up around 7am, just as the sun was beginning to rise. Temperatures never dropped below the high forties and the clear sky suggested a beautiful day for hiking. While Sparkles ate her breakfast I began to pack up all of our gear. Due to issues she had with her pack the day before I decided to take almost all her gear, except her hydration bladder, jacket, and a stuffed animal. I knew we'd have two big climbs at the end of our hike and I wanted to try and conserve her energy for the end of the day.We started out following an old forest road out of the gap, and we made excellent time all the way to Chattahoochee Gap, averaging about 2mph, which for a small seven year old is excellent time. Her feet felt much better, and her pack was no longer bothering her. We took a decent break at the gap before moving on, unfortunately, not too far past the gap her left ankle began to bother her, and it kept getting worse.Anyone who has hiked this stretch of trail will recall that there are a couple rock walks between Chattahoochee Gap and the campsite before Blue Mountain. Thankfully, the fun of the rocks (in her mind) kept her attention on them and not her bad ankle. However, she was beginning to slow down considerably due to the pain she was feeling. We finally made the campsite for another decent break, and at this point she had begun crying a little due to the pain. All I could do was give her some candy and play cheerleader, telling her how proud I was of her and that we were near the end. Even hurting, she talked about the next time we'd go hiking, and so I knew minus the pain that she was falling in love with backpacking. I was hoping the next stretch wouldn't be so bad, but it was worse than I thought it could be.More rocks were in the forecast, as was steep trail grade that really bothered her ankle. Tears ran down her face as we climbed up the trail to Blue Mountain Shelter. We were walking at less than 1mph at this point, and she asked to go rest in the shelter. I agreed. As soon as she sat down she became a little happier, ate the last of my candy, took some pictures, and then laughing told me she wasn't gonna run around the shelter like she did the day before. Her spirit always amazes me. After a twenty minute break we left the shelter around 1:30pm.Before you can descend Blue Mountain from the shelter you have to finish ascending which leaves you with two small up/downs, and one more significant up before finally descending 1.5 miles to Unicoi Gap. Sparkles was at the point where the downhills were worse than the uphills on her ankle. She made it up the first up without complaint, keeping good pace, but her composure cracked when she saw we had another climb. A big hug, and reassurances got her going again until she saw we had one last climb. Tears would be her constant companion for the rest of her hike. Momentary elation when we reached the top turned to tears again as she began to navigate the steep downhill. She knew I couldn't carry her, and so she soldiered on. About halfway down to the Gap I took her pack from her and carried it in one arm so that she only had to worry about herself. It seemed to help a little as we began to hear the sounds of traffic. We finally reached the Gap around 3:30pm, and as soon as we crossed the busy road, a smile came across her face as she high fived me because she had finished the hike. One of my enticements to finish was a promise that she could sit in the front seat on the way home. She quickly reminded me of this as she grabbed her booster seat to put in the front seat, before climbing in to wait for me. I loaded up the car, and then climbed in next to her. By 3:45 we were headed for home, and talking about our next hike. Pain and tears forgotten. I think the trail bug has bitten her pretty good.","Poplar Stamp Gap

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553482,"Some reflections on our hike this past weekend. -The old rule of one size up for trailrunners did not work so well for Sparkles. She wore Salomon XA Pro Comps and I think the extra size contributed to her ankle problem. I plan on buying her a smaller pair of shoes, maybe some Keens for our other hikes this year, and she can grow into her size 2s before wearing them again.-Her waist is too narrow for her new backpack (She has an Osprey Ace 38 Kid's Pack. Fit's her torso measurement, but she's very petite). The first day of hiking saw her carrying most weight on her shoulders. With her hipbelt tightened all the way, it still kept slipping. Next hike will see her carrying a smaller day-type pack. She can carry her water, camera, some snacks, a stuffed animal, and her jacket. I will carry the rest. The suspension of the Osprey Atmos was outstanding, and I plan on carrying less gear the next hike now that I have an idea of what issues we might face.-Hiking with a little one means keeping them entertained with what ""they"" like. I don't usually hike with my tablet, but I knew it would be a big hit when camping. It was, and it worked to get her to relax and have a good night. She had been afraid to camp in the middle of nowhere before going, but didn't even think about it once we were doing it. -Keep daily mileage low if there are climbs and descents. Sparkles can hike at 2mph for the first half of the day...maybe longer without significant climbs, but she tires faster than me. Knowing this comes in handy for future hikes this year. I think for the summer she'll be able to handle 10 mile plus days in Maryland and Pennsylvania, but she'll determine just how far we go.-When little ones are done, they are DONE!!!   First day, she hit Poplar Stamp Gap and I could tell she was done. Better to stop and keep her happy than to keep going and make her hate hiking. Be flexible with mileage when your hiking partner is under 10.Next planned hike is Carver's Gap to US19E. The plan is to drive up and spend the night at Mountain Harbour before getting shuttled to Carver's Gap. Day 1 will be a hike to Overmountain Shelter...a little over 5 miles. Day 2 will be a hike back to Mountain Harbour...about 9 miles. I think the open air hiking and views will keep her mind off of distance, and the downhill to 19E is about 3 miles of the 9 mile day...so she should enjoy that overall. Looking to do it around the beginning of April.Who knows, maybe we'll get out before then, but we'll play that by ear. Overall, this past weekend was a great one to hike, and I enjoyed spending time with my little girl.","Home

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558067,"Figured I'd throw up a post ahead of Sparkles and I going out this weekend. I'll be getting her out of school early tomorrow and we'll make the drive up to Mountain Harbour in Roan Mountain, TN. I haven't been up there since 2007, so I am looking forward to going back. We'll be hiking from Carver's Gap back to Mountain Harbour (Rte 19). It's about a 15 mile hike, and will be our final warm-up hike before we attempt Bear's Den Hostel, VA to Boiling Springs, PA this summer. I'm looking forward to doing the Roan Highlands again. The last time I traversed this section the weather was wonderful and the rhodos were blooming. It remains one of my favorite couple of days on the trail. We'll hike from Carver's Gap to Overmountain Shelter the first day, so no great rush. The second day is the longer of the two, but going over the two balds should be a great treat for Sparkles.I've switched out her Osprey pack for an REI Tarn 18 and sized her shoes down to a normal pair of Salomon XAs that aren't waterproof. I'll carry most of the gear, but she can carry some of her clothes and her water. If the gear works for her then we'll be dialed in for the summer hike.Weather is looking like it will be clear with highs around 60. There's a possibility of rain Saturday morning, but other than that visibility should be outstanding Sunday for when we go over the balds.As for food, I'm flying by the seat of my pants for the overnight. I figure no need for a stove, we'll just grab some fresh stuff to bring along. The joy of an overnight is that you don't need to worry about planning meals so much. Run out and grab some sandwiches Saturday morning and we should have lunch and dinner covered the first day...maybe grab some baked goods for breakfast both days. We'll see, Mountain Harbour has really stepped it up in the past couple of years with a solid resupply and now a food truck. This makes it a great base of operations, and a great place to return to in the future to maybe slackpack and grab some nearby mileage.Normally, I'm not a fan of slackpacking, but with a little one along it's about making it as enjoyable as possible for her, and walking without gear definitely can improve one's walk in the mountains.Anyways, not much else to tell. Just keeping my fingers crossed that the second day of hiking this time around does not result in tears for my little girl.","Nowhere

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559380,"Today started with a hike in the clouds. We left Mountain Harbour around 10 AM after a wonderful all-you-can-eat breakfast. After the storms earlier in the week, we began our hike with temps in the mid-thirties, walking in the clouds. Even with the cold, Sparkles was in high spirits and practically skipped down the trail. I, on the other hand, wished I had brought my thermal tights, but as long as I kept moving the cold wasn't so bad.I couldn't help but think about how different this hike was compared to the last time I was here back in the summer of 2007. Back then it was low seventies and the rhodos were blooming. We dawdled and took our time, even having lunch before leaving the ridge. Today, that was not the case, and we quickly moved off the ridge as we began the descent down to Stan Murray Shelter. We arrived at Stan Murray to meet our first folk on the trail, a group of day-hikers training for a Cystic Fibrosis charity hike. After eating our lunch and chatting for a bit, Sparkles and I began our final two miles to the shelter.Now, experts always say that little ones can hike a mile per year of age per day, and I have found that to be a pretty accurate assessment of a child's ability. At seven years of age, she can hike five miles at a pretty good clip, but moving past the five mile mark she begins to flag and her attention begins to wander. Luckily, she didn't start to flag until the final two-tenths of a mile, and then when she saw the shelter her spirits went sky high.Along with her spirits, the clouds parted and the sun came out, to give us a sunny afternoon/evening at Overmountain.After using the privy, and eating her Subway sandwich, she was all over the place, exploring the shelter, going with me to get water, and then moving about with her camera taking pictures and greeting new people as they came into the shelter. The shelter filled up with a number of hikers, and due to spring break for some, a small city of tents sprung up in the field. I made note of the massive house that could now be seen from the shelter as something that had not been there ten years before.Sparkles and I spent some time with three couples who had managed to build a fire, but we were eventually forced to our sleeping bags shortly after 8 PM due to dropping temperatures. Overall, it was a good day. Physically, she felt good and so did I. She did fall once during the day, but that was due to her not paying attention while walking (a habit on the trail and at home).Looking forward to going up and over the Balds tomorrow. The weather should be outstanding, and I can't wait to see the look on her face when we get up top.FYIs:1. Mountain Harbour's breakfast is the best I've had on the trail. I highly recommend it if you get the chance to stay there.2. Smokey Mountain Bakers is a nice little place to stop in and grabbed baked goods in Roan Mountain. Grabbed some little chocolate chip cookies for little miss to bring with, and I grabbed some blueberry scones for my breakfast tomorrow morning.3. Hiking with your little one is awesome, but know you will be hiking their hike and not your own.","Carver's Gap
",Overmountain Shelter,"Apr 01, Sat",5.60
Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559664,"We were up and out of the shelter by around 8:30 AM, and anyone who knows Sparkles knows that if allowed to she would sleep till 10 AM most days. We quickly began our climb up to Little Hump, and as always she can hike with the best of them right out of the gate. We made it up to the top of Little Hump pretty quickly, and it was awesome to see the look on her face as we emerged onto the bald.We began moving up and over the bald as thru-hiker after thru-hiker began to pass us by and temperatures warmed. Coming down off of Little Hump, we were making our way through some trees when a thru-hiker hailed me, and I turned to see Honey Badger coming my way. He asked me if I had left my down vest at the shelter, and I immediately remembered I had forgotten it hanging on a post. Luckily, true trail magic struck as he figured he'd catch us and had carried it along to me. Gotta love trail folk, and am thankful to him for bringing it back. He passed us as did some other hikers and then we came out of the trees to behold Big Hump. Sparkles needed a few minutes with pack off to sit and psych herself up for the big climb. She also needed to get her thermals off, because temps were already close to 70 degrees.We decided to tackle the large bald in sections. I'd point to a spot and tell her when we get to that point we'll take a breather. This plan worked well for us, and she continued to be amazed at everything she could see. I had forgotten that Big Hump has a false summit. You see a fence above and think that it's the top, but there's still climbing to be done after it, and so we continued up to the top. We descended a little bit to eat our lunch, and about halfway into our hike for the day, little miss began to slow down. This has been common on all our hikes and I was hoping a break and lunch would re-energize her.Sitting on some rocks we ate our lunches, and then began hiking again. She started out well after lunch, but soon came up behind me and told me that we'd better find a potty soon because she had to poop. I told her the closest was down at the B&B, and she said well then we'd better dig a hole because she had to go really bad. Unfortunately, where we were at was a steep drop off but we soon came to an area that flattened off enough for us to move away from the trail for her to do her business. I know some of this may seem gross if you aren't a hiker, but this was the first time she would be pooping in a hole, and to be honest I was quite proud of her for it. She did it without fuss or complaint, other than to say it was gross, but still most kids would balk at the thought. I dug her hole, and then let her hold my arms to make it easier for her. Soon enough we were on our way again.Things began to drastically slow down after the ""potty break."" This is becoming standard as she begins to dawdle. She slows because she is tiring, and she slows because she begins to look at things her seven-year old mind finds interesting. It seemed to take forever to get down to Doll Flats, and I hiked a little ahead of her, getting across the open area, setting pack down, and walking back across to meet her as she emerged. Taking a pack-off break near the state line, we were met by the couples we shared the fire with, who also took a short break. They quickly disappeared down the trail as we began hiking again. I soon realized just how slow we were going when two ladies (one older) overtook us, and then passed us by. I stayed on their heels for awhile, but Sparkles began to drop way behind and I slowed down to stay with her.She has a habit of asking me, ""How much longer?"" My response is always the same. ""That depends on how fast or slow you hike."" The last time through this area I had done an 18 mile day leaving Overmountain. We had about a mile left, and I knew she was ready to be done for the day. I decided to show her something. Standing next to me I told her to take a step, and then I took a step. She could see my one step was 2-3 of her smaller steps. I told her she was hiking as fast as most people, but for her size, and that when she was keeping up she was hiking twice as fast as me. It seemed to make her a little happier, and it reminded me that for someone just over four feet tall, keeping up with a grown man over six feet tall isn't an easy thing.We eventually gained sight of the road, and with it her excitement grew. As we hit the road, and crossed 19E, she kept right on my heels all the way to the Mountain Harbour driveway. We immediately hit the resupply shop to check-in for our stay, and I decided to upgrade to a B&B room from the hostel to surprise Sparkles, and got the Jefferson Room, which has a whirlpool soaking tub, as little miss was complaining of sore feet.We took our stuff up to the room, and Shannon showed us the bathroom which Sparkles fell in love with the tub. We then went back down to order food from the food truck, which was excellent, and ate our dinners. Two thru-hikers were doing work for stay, and even after the nine mile day, Sparkles began helping them to move rocks to build a path. I don't know where she gets the energy, but she did this for close to an hour before I told her it was time to go up and get washed up. She soaked in the tub for a half hour, before getting out. We then went down to sit on the porch for a little while before it was time for her to turn in. I left her watching tv and went downstairs for some adult conversation.All in all, it was a great hike, and Sparkles passed the fifty mile mark on the AT (I know, she's .10 short, but she did do .20 miles to Mountain Harbour). I'm hiking much slower than I'm used to, but I'm having a great time with my little girl, and wouldn't trade it for the world.","Overmountain Shelter

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561952,"So I'm sitting here procrastinating going to bed and it's partly because Sparkles and I are one month out from our big summer adventure. That's right, folks...in one month Little Miss and myself will pick up the trail at Bears Den Hostel and head north. We have eleven days of hiking bliss planned, and we shall see how far we actually get. Tentatively I've revised our plan and have us going 109 miles. I think it's realistic based upon our two shake down hikes, but we shall she what her legs can handle. I did cherry-pick this terrain with her seven year-old frame in mind, and think it should be a great confidence builder for her. We've got two planned nero days in the hike. The first will be Harpers Ferry and the second will be Sunflower Cottage. We'll need these for quick resupplies and laundry...plus it will give her little body a chance to recharge and hopefully be stronger for it. I ordered a camera mount for my hiking pole, and we might film some video with my camera this hike. If I do so, I'll probably get a Youtube page going for us. My hope is to show the realities of hiking with a little one, and not the pretty bullshit many folks try to throwout there. It's more awesome than frustrating, but anyone who is an honest parent will definitely agree that the frustrating is there.I know there are younger kids who have thru-hiked and done bigger mileage, but I'm still pretty impressed by her willingness to push through the suck and keep going. I'm looking forward to our years on the trail as she grows and gets older. I tell her all the time there will come a day where she'll hike faster than her daddy, but hopefully that day is still a long way off.Anyways, the plan is to hike to around Mt. Holly Springs. I'll have to figure out the ride back to Bears Den, but that's part of the fun of the trail...waiting to see what the trail provides. It all works out in the end, and I'm hoping to teach that one very important lesson about life to Sparkles...it all works out in the end.","Home

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563331,"Sparkles and I now have a YouTube channel where we will post videos, slide shows, and gear reviews from her perspective.  Our first video/slide show from our shakedown hikes is up.   We might get some gear reviews up before our summer hike, and then I hope to have mostly video posts after that.  Wanted to share with anyone who might be interested.  You can find us as Walking Dead Bear & Sparkles on YouTube.   Less than twenty days till we set foot on the trail again!!!","Home

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565107,"One week out, and my brain has already hit the trail.  This is pretty common for me when the hiking bug bites, and it has bitten hard this year.  I didn't get out last year, and instead kept myself busy with other things, but this year, busy or not, the trail has been on my mind daily since December.  Add to it that I have a new hiking partner, and I cannot wait to hit the trail.  So far this year I have only revisited places hiked in the past, but this summer promises a new stretch of the trail that will add to my total mileage which is getting close to the 1,300 mile mark on the AT.  It also means I'm close to 3,000 total miles hiked since I've started keeping track.
All of that said, I more excited to see how Sparkles handles a multi-day hike.  She will go over 100 miles on the trail, and may hit the 150 mile mark this summer.  I look forward to seeing her confidence grows as she meets such milestones.  I also love that I get to share something I love so much with someone I love so much.  The wife has been out and would do smaller section hikes, but she has no desire to ever thru-hike, and I can't blame her, most do not.  However, I think Sparkles has the makings of a potential thru-hiker, and so I want to make sure I do all of this right.  Hiking with kids, cultivating a love of backpacking is a marathon, not a sprint, and it needs to be treated that way.
As an old friend would say, this hike ""isn't about the miles, it's about the smiles.""  This hike is designed to be fun.  Eleven days and around 110 miles is the plan.  Now that isn't even 10 miles a day, and I can't remember when I last averaged under 15 a day.  There is a part of me that can't help but think I'd top 200 miles this hike going solo, but it also wouldn't be as much fun.  Sparkles reminds me to look around and see the beauty.  She reminds me that the miles aren't why I'm out there, and she gives me hope for the future as I watch her interact with the people and places she passes by.
So, a week from now I'll pull her from school early (her last day), and we will drive north for a few hours, get a hotel room, and sleep.  On Friday the 26th we'll get up early and drive up to Bears Den Hostel, where we will park and start walking north.  We have eleven days planned and see where our feet take us.  I do have a room reserved on that Saturday night in Harper's Ferry, but other than that we'll walk based upon what Sparkles can do.  I do have minimum miles written up, but each day it will be her choice upon hitting the mark if we stop or keep going.  Hiking this way makes her a serious part of the decision making process which I think is important for kids.
I might post one more time before we head out, and if I do it will be to talk briefly about gear, but we'll see.  I did put another video up on our YouTube page, but that's just me talking about hiking with children.  
Anyways, if you see us out and about, please come up and say hi.  We always like to meet new people, and it makes her feel more a part of this fraternal community of happy wanderers.","Home

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572945,"So...only about two months after our hike am I posting to our trail journal.  Honestly, that's about par for the course for anyone that knows me.  This will be an abbreviated posting as we now have a YouTube channel where I am posting daily videos of our hike, I will post a link at the end of each posting, so feel free to check them out.  Sparkles even did some filming and picture taking which I have included in the videos.
We didn't get to Bears Den until after noon.  After parking and taking care of some necessary things we finally got underway around 1 pm.  Picking up the trail in the middle of the roller coaster was interesting, and I didn't remember it being as rough from the tail end of my last hike.  We stopped about an hour into our hike to eat lunch and to let Sparkles take a rest after she took a nasty fall crossing a stream...for a minute I thought we might have to end our hike shortly after starting it, but a few band-aids made everything ok.  
We didn't see more than a handful of people on this first day of hiking, and other than one guy early on, all the people we saw were day hikers headed south, except for a woman with her dog doing a sobo section hike.  We ran into her just as we finished the rollercoaster and she was kind enough to take our picture as we rested.  The remaining distance after the rollercoaster wasn't bad at all, and we soon found ourselves at the trail to Blackburn.  Originally, I had thought we might push on, but Sparkles wanted to be done, and her hiking speed had already drastically slowed, so we opted to go into Blackburn, and was happy we did.
The Center was full up with the Cadillac trail crew that was getting ready to do some significant work at the center over the holiday weekend, and we were invited to stay in the bunkhouse, and to join them for dinner.  We got to meat Trailboss, and his lovely wife, ATC Chair Sandi Marra.  Sparkles was excited because there was another seven-year-old little girl to play with, and she proceeded to run around all night with her (showing tired of hiking, doesn't mean tired for a little kid).  After eating dinner, some socializing, and prepping for the next day we turned in at around 10 pm, with a 12.4 mile day planned to take us into Harpers Ferry.

Walking Dead Bear and Sparkles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572953,"We left out of Blackburn around 7 am, and took the shorter, steep route out of the Center.  We encountered a baby copperhead while climbing, but a quick flick of my hiking pole removed him from our path.  We made great time to David Lesser Shelter where we took a pack-off break, called Mom, and had a snack.  Shortly after leaving the shelter the sky decided to open up on us.  Sparkles had a little melt down and came up the trail in tears until I reminded her she had her rain jacket, and once on, she was still not happy about the rain, but no more tears.  Shortly after, we started encountering active and retired military out for a Memorial Day weekend Ruck Hike.  One of the Ruckers pointed to Sparkles and shouted at the other soldiers and vets saying, ""If this little girl can be out here in this, then we've got nothing to complain about!""  Sparkles straightened up a little after that.  We continued to make great time into Keys Gap, and the rain finally stopped just as we walked into Sweet Springs (the walk down to the store is sketchy to say the least).  I had a cheeseburger and chips, and little miss ate some chicken tenders and potato wedges.  The hot food was welcome as I was soaked to the bone, and Sparkles merely cold but dry.  After an hour break, we got a move on with 6 miles still to hike.  Fifteen minutes in, and the skies opened up again.  This would be the highlight of the afternoon as I would dry out just to get rained on again.  We encountered many day hikers in the afternoon, but no thru-hikers until almost into Harpers Ferry.  I did take a moment as we left Virginia to do a happy dance, finally finished with a state that seemed to never end.  We could hear the Shenandoah before we could see it as we made our descent into Harpers Ferry.  The sound of the river gave Sparkles a burst of energy that got us up and over the bridge that crossed the swollen river.  After crossing the river we found that we still needed to make a climb and follow the trail that would take us to the old part of town.  Little Ms. was not happy about that, but she did what needed to be done, and we were happy that the rain had stopped.  I promised he a milkshake to put a pep in her step as we made it down into town.  A quick stop at the Outfitter to grab some Xero camp sandals for me, and we grabbed Sparkles a milkshake before heading up to check into our room at the Town's Inn.  After checking in, we managed to get to a restaurant before 6 pm (everything closes early in Harpers Ferry!!!), where Sparkles again had chicken fingers and I had some pulled pork nachos.  After dinner we headed back to the room for showers, laundry (they did it for us), and a root beer float before turning in for the night.  Tomorrow will be short day to Ed Garvey, as we will play tourist a bit before heading out of town.Important Note!!!   Sparkles pushed back her daily record of 9.1 miles, and put in 12.4 miles for her longest day yet!  Very proud of her as it is no easy thing for a seven-year-old to hike over 12 miles on her second day out.Day Two Video is up on YouTube!","Blackburn Trail Center
