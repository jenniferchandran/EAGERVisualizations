Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520362,"Looks like the best way to resupply is to use the usps flat rate shipping, medium flat (3.5"") box fits 5 days worth of food. Cost $7.99 and they provide the box's and will pick it up at my house. Most re supplies will be to post offices, esp ones near the trail restaurants and laundry. Directly to a hotel otherwise. Tried re supplying I town on the LT and wasted time, money and did not get what I needed. 
Also testing using Walmart. Free shipping, 7 days, with orders
$50 or more 2 day for $5.99. Create an account, make a list of the stuff you want and just pick from the list and add a shipping address - real easy.
Tried Amazon but could not order small quantaties, like 1 box of couscous.",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520440,"So pumped that I was able to get my pack weight from 33 lbs to 28.4, including 5 days of food and 1 lt water. I focused on the food and minimizing it with the highest calorie per oz ratio. I also changed my cook-set from the GSI Duelist to the Minimalist. Guess I will be eating alot GORP, Snickers, Pop Tarts, Instant Breakfast mix, Skittles, Couscous, Slim Jims, and Mountain House dinners.",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Fri",0
Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520691,Training...Continue to train on the Arc trainer at the Y and am now at a real challenging level for an hour a day. Mixing cardio with strength training. Starting two weeks before my thru hike start date I plan to toughen up my feet by hiking 6-8 miles a day at my local SP with my pack fully loaded and trail cloths. It has some tough terrain and is basically a perfect training ground.,,Wells SP Sturbridge MA,"Jan 30, Sat",0
Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521290,"Changed my pack to one that has front and top access. Making it easier to pickup in the morning and get gear, regardless of location easy. Also allowed me to put food, heaviest item, on the bottom where it is supposed to be. The pack is about the same weight as my current ULA one.Also returned my Big Agnes 30 degree sleeping bag that was 2lbs 14oz for an LL Bean ultralight 35 degree bag that is 2lbs.My cold weather pack is now 32 lbs with food and water. Acceptable since it will get ~ 1.5 lbs lighter each day when I eat the food in it.",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Wed",0
Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521664,"Did a test with cheap socks and my feet hurt. The next day I did the same hike with my liners and Darn Tough socks and no foot pain. 
I learned last year how important socks were with massive blisters. I had two pairs of liners and Darn Toughs thinking that I would clean them and they would dry, nope.   This year I'm bring 5 pair of liners, very light, and 2 pair of Darn Tough socks. I also added OR bug off gaiters to keep the dirt and rain out. 
That and lower initial miles should make my feet happy.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Thu",0
Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523273,"Hiking with full pack to condition myself and get my feet hardened is going well. Hips seem to be cranky the next day but a little Vitamin I and i'm good. Like using the gators to keep the dirt and bugs out. Makes more of a difference then I thought it would. Date for our trek start has moved up to April 1st! Getting really pumped, started jogging and dancing on the trail to mix it up ;-) Frogs have started croaking yesterday in the vernal pools and the geese have begun their return.",,Hiking ~ 6 to 8 miles per day,"Mar 12, Sat",6
Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523493,"Tested reconstituting a Rice Side in its bag with hot water. After about 20 min it was 90% done. I like my GSI minimalist cook set better. Just place the pot with hot water in the cozy, then add the Rice side, place the cover on the top and wait. Not much mess and works better. I also can loose the Side bags and put the contents in lighter sandwich bags or quart freezer bags, adding dehydrated veg and protein.    Also found making making mac-n-cheese easier in freezer bag. Just make the noodles in the pot, drain and the mix it up in the bag. Much cleaner and mixes better as my pot is small.",,Rice/Pasta Side lesson learned,"Mar 13, Sun",0
Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525012,"Hiking over 10 miles per day now w/o problem. Most importantly   my feet feel good. I started not using my trekking poles and i feel like i move faster, except on the down hills. Also hiking in the rain, rain kilt meets my gators nicely. No water in boots or on cloths. Eating just 3 cups of gorp over 5 hrs of hiking and feeling like that is a great addition to my routine. Once I feel a little hungry I nibble. Still have to 3000+ càlories per day. Also lots of water to avoid the problem that I had last year.Finding great deals on health food so I'm doing the mail drop gig where it makes sence.Got a new smart phone that has a battery that will last 2 days. Much longer on airport mode. Add waterproof case so it won't get wet while it's raining and I'm reading my trail guide. Getting excited as we're leaving in 15 days.",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Sun",0
Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525397,"Hiked 11+ miles in the rain. Gaiters worked well as my ULA rain kilt met the I was warm a dry for over 5hrs of wet hiking. Decided to add tea to my food supply, something hot after that would have been nice. Trail magic already starting for me as a person I know on the trail offered the drive me to Harper's Ferry! How nice esp. Since it's a 7 hr drive!

Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532325,"Hiked from northern NY to North Adams MA over the last 13 days, 175 miles. Averaging over 13 miles per day. I am mostly alone in the shelters but they were in good shape. Lots of people on the trail. Even in the cold mist and rain. Heading down the Harper's Ferry this weekend to continue my NOBO portion of my flip flop thru hike.Updated my gear. Sent my 35degree bag back, needed an emergency blanket each night, and got a 20degree 650 fill down bag. I also swapped my Klymit pad for a Sea to Summit comfort plus. I slep outside, cowbow style in 32 degree weather and had to open the bag because I was so hot. Gained a pound in pack weight but I think I will use Lightweight long johns to sheid some of that weight.Really like hiking with a 30# pack. Includes everything, 5 days food and 1/LT water. Plus our nice 2 person tent. 5 pairs of sock liner, 5 nylon boxers...etc.My trail name is officially Yoda now. People have confirmed it, Yoda am I.","Kent CT

Yoda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535824,"Everything has been great. Continue to meet amazing people and see wonderful things. Doing a flop flop and following spring north was the way to go for me. Lots of people doing it this year. I'm a few weeks ahead of the bubble @ the Ekville Shelter in PA. Everyone is looking forward to finishing PA. Sure it's rocky but it's also a big state and alot of the trail is along ridgelines, whick I like but you don't get alot of nice views.Maryland was really nice and I will go back to visit when this adventure is done. With a car! ;-)Staying at the Common Grounds retreat now. Great to hang in the vally that you see from Pulpit Rock on the trail.","Harper's Ferry, TeaHorse Hostel

Leaving from Springer on March 10th or sooner, weather depending. I learned so much last season! Finally got my gear and food down to a science. Met so many wonderful people as well. I wanted to post more but posting updates on this site was a pain, first I had to load the images the write the text, seemed to consume alot of time and battery power in usually poor network areas. I will do a better job this season. I did all of my posting on FB but will do some hear as well.","Springer Mountain
