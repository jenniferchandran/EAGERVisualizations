Finn & Schifft,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555868,"Less than 2 weeks to go - EEEEKKK!! Not ready yet. Still only 2 mail drops packed. I stopped trail prep for a week to make a aby quilt for my great-granddaughter - born on March 7. I wanted to have it done before she arrived and I made it. whew! I booked the shuttle from Atlanta to Amicalola on Friday - with Survivor Dave. He had lots of advice - including getting the 2017 version of AWOL's guide. He said the trail profiles don't change but the town info changes a lot every year. So I got nervous about setting up mail drops on last year's information. New guide book arrives today. Hopefully I will get some packing done today. Tomorrow we are going down to Chicago to see the baby. So no packing tomorrow. And no hiking training. again. I've been keeping up on the elliptical. I'm up to 90 minute sessions, but it is very difficult. I thought I would be doing two 90-minute sessions a day by now, with more resistance than I am doing. I am worried about my ability to climb. I will find out soon!","

Finn & Schifft,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556611,"I spent a good part of last night reading trail journals. Wow, I take my hat off, but only briefly, to all of you on the trail. And I am really, really glad Finn vetoed my suggestion that we start on March 14th. With less than a week before we start walking there is still much to do. Finn has spent most of last year preparing for this. We went to Colorado over a year ago and did some day hiking at higher altitudes and again last summer we were in Jackson, Wyoming. We live in the flat lands of the Midwest where 1000' above sea level is pretty high. When we returned from the Tetons we began weekly hikes with packs on the Ice age trail here in Wisconsin. Finishing with a two week walk from north of Elkheart Lake to Whitewater Lake. We camped and carried all our food. This taught us a few things.Finn has been drying food and packing it up to be shipped to drops along the way. The selection of drops has been worked out with some optimism, and considerable caution.Our first day of walking is March 22.",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Thu",0
Finn & Schifft,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557005,Time flies! Tomorrow morning we fly to Atlanta and then take a shuttle to Amicalola Falls. I need to finish packing and stop fretting about the small stuff.The Plan is to Be atop Springer Mountain Thursday and then on the Stover Creek Shelter for the night. After that we just keep eating and walking. This should be easy?Schifft,"

Finn & Schifft,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557254,"A perfect day for hiking. So, we did over half of the approach trail today, which is described as brutal. While not exactly a cake walk, I would call it somewhat difficult in spots. So a HUGE thank you to Katie (my personal trainer) for doing such an awesome job of getting me ready for my adventure. My haiku for today:Beauty surrounds me.Feeling strong and hopeful.Every step a pleasure.Today anyway. I think I was wise to start us off with short days.   And perhaps the approach will be brutal tomorrow. But I think not.I love the Len Foote Hike Inn. It's pricey, but I learned today that they do work-for-stay for thru hikers. if we do this again, I'll remember thatFinn!","The Lodge at Amicalola Falls

Finn & Schifft,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558068,"Actually we started at Low Gap this morning and intended to go to Tray Mountain. But it took us 5 hours to go 6.6 miles. Tray was another 9 miles, with 2 peaks to traverse. So we had shorted the goal to some campsites 5 miles past Blue, with only 1 peak to do. But we were staggering at 2:30 pm. With at least 4 more hours of hard walking. So we stayed here.The trail is hard. Or I am not as strong as I thought. It seems to get harder every day, and I thought it would be getting easier by now. But I am absolutely thrilled to be here, to be doing this. Every step is still a pleasure. Even when I'm staggering. The weather has been great. We've been very fortunate. The scenery is spectacular. And there's not much that's better than walking in the woods in my book. Love to all. Darkness is fhalling, and battery life must be conserved. The solar charger does not work at all, and has been returned to home.Purple violetsWhite butterfly, baby mouseSpring on the AT","

Finn & Schifft,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561088,"First, my apologies for the lack of updates. Three problems with journal updates: 1- we don' have Internet access most of the time. Hardly ever on the trail, and sometimes not even when we are in town or at a hostel; 2- I have twice typed up entries and then had them fail to upload to the website; and 3- most days there's not much to write about. Nothing much happens. Really. We eat walk and sleep. That's pretty much it. That said, since it's been a few weeks, there have been some ""adventures"". Onsecof my poles broke, so I walked three days with just one color, abuse stressed the ligaments of my (formerly) good knee. We spent three days in Franklin letting it rest. We couldn't stand being in town after 3 days, and headed Back out, into a snowstorm. We got wet and really really cold. 26 degrees does not seem so cold, but when you're trying to sleep outside, and spending 2 or 3 days outside in it - it's COLD. But we survived, and it was very beautiful. Then the handle brokecoff our water filter, making it a real struggle for Tom to get the water filtered. REI shipped my new poles to me at Franklin, and we got the water filter replacement at Fontana Dam. So everything is functioning again. We are in Gatlinburg TN tonight. Remarkably like the Dells for all my WI friends.   We have walked 206.8 miles of the trail, so we have less than 2,000 to go. Woo hoo!! We've been been walking in Smokies Mountain National Park for the last 4 days, in lots of rain and mud. Glad to be inside tonight and dry. Back out tomorrow, with 3 more days of rain expected. Love you all!","Mt Collins Shelter

Finn & Schifft,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563163,"Tom and I have not been hiking since last Sat (April 29).  On Thursday, for no apparent reason, my Achilles tendon started hurting while we we hiking.  My blisters seemed a little better.  Have I talked about my blisters?  Really wicked blisters between my big and second toe, on both feet.  Very big, very deep, very painful blisters... Hiking on Friday was especially beautiful - we crossed over Max Patch - the most beautiful place we've seen this far.  A huge grassy bald, with 360-degree views of the Smokies all around.  It was warm, sunny, green - like Ireland green.  Stunning.  The foot pain seemed manageable.  On Fri night I got diarrhea, soiled my sleeping while I was sleeping (yeah, really gross; it just cut loose with no warning...).   And my feet were in bad shape.  We hiked 3 miles back to Max Patch and a road, and called for a shuttle to Hot Springs.   We stayed at a hostel.  I went to a clinic on Monday, they gave me a shot of and prescription for  Prednazone (Anti-inflammatory steroid) for my ankle, antibiotics for my blisters (precautionary only, they weren't infected) and said I would probably be able to get back on the trail Wed afternoon.On Tue, I was still having trouble walking because of my heel, so we decided to wait til Thursday morning to hike.  After running errands in town on Wed I could barely walk so I went back to the clinic.  A different doctor - he said at least 3 more days, maybe longer, or I risked needing to be helicoptered off the trail.Tom facebooked a cryptic message to his nephew Craig, who lives in NC, to see if he could come and get us.  But it wasn't a private message as he thought, it was a public post, and set off quite a tizzy of folks worrying about us.  Craig and Lisa came and got us - bless them both, they are busy people and we were 5 hours away from their home.  So we are now in West End NC, at Craig and Lisa's lovely home, and will be here until we are completed fident that my ankle is healed.  Personally, I think 2 or 3 days of total rest, as in zero walking, with icing, heating  pad and stretching, will fixour journey, and we have com me up.  So this is day one.  So, this day 45 of our journey, and we have complete a grand total of 255.5 miles of the trail.  I'll update you all when we head back out.","

Finn & Schifft,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564778,"Sadly, the adventure ends very prematurely.  I had an MRI of my ankle last Thu, and got the report today.  Stress fractures on my heel and 2nd and 3rd metatarsils.  So we are heading home.  The spirit is willing, but the bones are weak.  I feel betrayed by my body. And very sad.  ","
