Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530867,Just a starting journal entry. Planning a Springer start first week April 2017. I'm been dreaming of this for years. Lots of time with research and following others. And some practice hikes.,,Initial Entry Feb 2016,"Feb 01, Mon",0

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548873,"First practice hike. Drove down to this site south of Bloomington, IN. Stopped for a big lunch. Drove on and parked at Blackwell Campground about 2:00. Nice clear day in 50's. Hiked about 7 miles. Rolling hills and heavily forested. Nothing too exciting. No undergrowth, so can see a long ways through woods. The campsite I wanted to stay at was on a high point and in the wind. As it was to get down to about 30 this night, went a little farther and found a decent site off the trail a short ways and out of wind. Stealth camp! Got camp set up, gathered firewood and started fire. Ate supper in the dark, but that was ok. Stayed up quite a while reading and enjoying fire. Did get down to 30 as predicted. Took my down coat and wore it in evening. Stayed comfortable in 15 degree sleeping bag with a base layer.",,Charles Deam Wilderness Day 1 Apr 2016,"Apr 05, Tue",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548875,"Up when got light. Got fire going and kept warm. Made some coffee, and just ate a granola bar. Water is low and need to keep a little to drink until I get to water source. Packed up and got going. Going to be warmer today and stayed clear and sunny. Got into the 60's at warmest. First part of hike was on a trail that has been forest road and probably was originally a road to farms, etc when this area was farmed up until the 30's. There were a few places where an alternate trail went around some low spots that were muddy. This trail can also be used by horses, so they can make things more muddy. Turned off on the Axsom trail and this was my favorite of the hike there. Went down steeply on a single track and bottomed out at a stream. I filtered water here and filled up. Was my first real use of new system. Kind of hard to fill the bag from the stream, but got the job done. Then got out my stove and fixed a hot breakfast and enjoyed the site. Hiked on to Sycamore trail and this was mostly single track too. Took a side trail out to a small pond and a cemetery just to check it out. There were 3 campsites near the end of this trail They were nice spots and I set up at the last one. Had nice logs and rocks to sit on and use for setup. Quite a bit warmer tonight. Another nice fire. Cooked supper and stayed up quite a while. Hiked about 10 miles today. Felt pretty good at end.",,Charles Deam Wilderness Day 2,"Apr 06, Wed",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548876,"Slept a little later. Made some oatmeal for breakfast and packed up. Filtered a little more water from the stream next to my camp before I left. Hiked rest of Sycamore trail. Up a very steep climb out of the creek valley. This was another pretty area of the park. There was a fire tower, but did not climb up it. Kind of getting tired and not that much to see. Hiking the Grubb Ridge trail most of rest of day. It parallels the road that runs through the park. Most of the time it was out of sight, but when one of the few cars went down it, could hear it. There was about half mile where I had to hike on the road to continue that trail. Total distance today was about 7 miles.Back to car and hit the road home. Good hiking trip.",,Charles Deam Wilderness Day 3,"Apr 07, Thu",0

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554774,"Left home yesterday morning and camped in Wayne National Forest at far east southeast part of Ohio. Had a fire and cooked supper. Nice night.
Up early next day and drove into West Virginia. Heading for Manongah, WV to meet up with Steve, my brother in law's brother (got that). Arrived about 5:00. Steve is staying here temporarily while he works in nearby Morgantown. It was his grandmother's home that he and brother in law Anthony spent much time at growing up. The town is a traditional coal mining town. Mine closed now. We toured around town and then went to a great Italian restaurant. Back and enjoyed the rest of the evening. Great to see Steve, and visit he and Anthony's childhood town. Also met Uncle Mike up the street who shared some of his homemade goods.",,WV stay with friend,"Jun 01, Wed",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536831,"Left Monongah early and drove into Maryland. Camped tonight at Greenbriar St Park. Set up camp early, then worked my way south and stopped first at Fox Gap. AT Mile 1068. There was a small battle here leading up to the Anteniem battle south of here a couple days later. Met one couple hiking. Gave them the location. She was doing a lot of phone talking. He just looked tired. They were about my age and were section hiking a few days.Drove south to Gathland State Park and War Correspondent Memorial. Talked to several hikers. One young couple were through hiking but had only been out about 10 days. They were Veronica and Chad. She said her blog was BezzleWrites but have not found it. She was hurt and going to an Urgent Care in the area. I offered ride, but their Uber showed up not long after that. Another couple were on 3rd of 4 day section hike going south. Talked to them quite a bit. Ended up running into them again the next day in Harpers Ferry. They made it to their destination!

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536834,"Packed up this morning and drove down to Harpers Ferry. Went to Nat Park Visitors center and then rode bus down to the center of town. Should have just drove down there and found a place to park. Saw a few of the sites there and then hiked the official AT trail from there up to the AT Conservancy. Hung out there a while. Talked to a lot of hikers. Cheap and Easy / MorningLori were a couple I remember. MorningLori is on Trail Journals. Fun place to visit and talk to lots of people about the trail / equipment. Walked back down to center of town on streets. Got some lunch and then rode bus back to get my car. Decided to hike up to the Split Rock overlook. About 3 miles and 1000 feet up. Parked below bridge over Shenandoah River. Had my day pack and some basics. Walked across bridge and started to sprinkle. Off bridge and started up to top of ridge. After a few minutes met a hiker Spoonie. Talked a few minutes and headed on up. Right after that started to rain hard. Trail turned to a stream. Put on rain coat. Just kept climbing. Made it the 1 mile and to the top in about 45 minutes. Rain let up then. Took off down the side trail to Split Rock overlook. Dropped down about 400 feet to get to it. Stayed there a while and enjoyed view, sun. While heading back, heard sound and saw movement to my left. Thought I would be seeing a deer, but no. It was a bear. Bear took off running away at quick pace. Surprised me. Sure was not expecting that. Other sightings were Eastern Box Turtles. I think they come out after rains. Very Orange colored on legs, etc. See picture. Got back to car quite a bit quicker on the down hill return track. While driving through town, saw Spoonie walking down street. Offered her a ride. Went to nearby hostel and she went in to check it out and see someone who was there. I stuck around as she thought might want to go to another campsite in town. She came back and I dropped her off at the campsite. Young lady in first year after graduating HighSchool in NY City. Really nice to talk to her. Needed to get on the road after that. Headed west toward home. Drove about an hour and stayed at another MD state park called Rocky Gap near Cumberland. Got in there about dark. Drove on home the next day.",,Harpers Ferry,"Jun 03, Fri",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551679,"Did get my tent decided. MSR Hubba. One person, free standing. It is free standing and I like that. Good size vestibule on door side and another smaller one other side. Got some Tyvek and made a ground cloth. Not sure if that will be going with me. Never have been a big ground cloth guy. Is tight, but for the quality and weight, seems the right choice. I will be able to fit my empty pack in vestibule along with other things. Then inside will be the essentials for sleep and my clothes.I bought a Big Agnes UL tent at same time, but Hubba is the choice. Mainly the more rugged construction was the tie breaker. And the BA was a two person taking up a lot more ground space with a little more weight.",,Tent,"Aug 04, Thu",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548879,"I have set up enough stuff to put in my pack and make 30lbs. Have been hiking with this at several area parks. Usually is hot, so am stopping at 4 to 6 miles most of the time. Starved Rock, which has a 5 mile out and 5 miles back distance is one location. There are also the long steps there, so that is a good workout. And to Silver Springs which is a 3 mile loop.

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548881,"Decided to go up here to this 50,000 acre park at kind of last minute. My brother in law was in the Wisconsin Iron Man race in Madison on the 11th, and I wanted to see him participate. That was a good start for the trip up, so was able to tag this trip on. After the Iron Man, I drove on up to Wausau and got a cheap hotel. Then on to Porcupine Mountains on the 12th. Got on the trail about 10:00 after checking in at Visitors Center and paying fees, etc. $24 a night with entrance fee and camping permit. Park is really awesome. Borders Lake Superior on north and then lots of virgin forest and mountains of sorts. I parked at Lake of the Clouds parking lot / trailhead. Had to hike about half mile on the road to get to the Lake Superior trailhead. Asked a ranger if there was a trail instead and he said not really. Superior trail started in some previously logged area, but well forested now. Generally downhill for a while, then up a little to a ridge overlooking lake about 100' below. Followed this a while and then dropped down to near lake after about 3 miles. Trail was back from lake usually 100 to 200 yards. Lots of mud, but was able to rock and root hop a lot. Hiking poles helped out a lot with this. There were also some areas with simple boardwalks of a couple 2 x 6 on blocks.Stopped at Lone Rock for lunch. Beautiful day. Passing occasional camps along lake, but heading for basically the last one before the trails / rivers intersections area ahead. Got to my camp at 5:00. Hiked 11 miles today. Beautiful spot with a small stream emptying into Lake Superior. Chairs of rocks and logs around fire pit. Got camp set up and fire. Then not long after started looking like rain. Light rain for a shot time. Then paused, so got my supper cooked and eaten. Rain came back about dark, so had to call it a night. Rained lightly most of night. Wind picked up and waves got louder. No threat, but got tired of the louder noise of waves.",,Porcupine Mountain Wilderness Day 1,"Sep 12, Mon",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549224,"Up about daylight to nice weather with drying breeze. Made coffee and breakfast. Packed up and hit trail about hour later. Came to the trail intersection and rustic cabin area after about a mile. Bridge out over Big Carp River. Found log up stream, but it was a little high. Ended up wading at mouth of river on the lake. Met 4 middle age guys here and talked with them a little. Headed on down the lake trail past several more campsites. Talked to another single female hiker out backpacking. Had seen another young lady yesterday. More mud and rock hopping in this section too. Came to the Little Carp River and trail. Turned inland on it, hiking uphill. Crossed river on logs and rocks. Nice trail and change of forest with larger and a variety of trees. Had lunch at a cascading falls, and then lost trail for a while before realizing I needed to wade across the river again. About 2:30, got to the campsite I was heading for. I did not like the site that well and it was still early. Talked to a lady who was hiking the sections of the North Country Trail which passes through this park. Hiked past another rustic cabin and on another 3 miles to campsite on the river. About 12 miles today. 
Had a hard time getting a fire going, but eventually had a good one for rest of evening. Had Kroll teriyaki noodles for supper. Pretty good. Hung up food on bear pole. Read a while by fire and generally relaxed. Got a little cold over night. New light weight sleeping bag is not going to work out. Only dropped to about 45. Think I will send it back.

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549282,"Up at daylight again. Tent pretty damp from condensation and dew. Tried to get it dried out, but still was damp when packing. Got going in about hour and half. Had to wade the river again at the beginning, so put on crocs to start. Then changed into boots across other side. Going to be hiking back to car today. Had originally planned 4 days here, but made my route quicker. Could alter to a longer route, but going to head on back. Got to Lilly Pad cabin pretty quick. Talked to people there They had stayed 5 nights. Then on to Mirror Lake. It is higher elevation and I was climbing quite a bit. Not bad though. Several cabins there, and some campsites. Talked to a father / son who came in on Monday and got really wet. They were in lots of cotton and still trying to dry out. Today should be a little better for that. Saw a middle age couple and dog several times today. They had done same route as me, but in 4 days. Quite a few other people as I got closer to the Lake of the Clouds parking lot. Was really muddy a lot today. Some boardwalks, but not much. Quite a bit of ups and downs from Mirror Lake and then climbed a lot the last couple miles. There was a really deep narrow gorge on my left for a while. It flowed north into Scott Creek which fed Big Carp river. Got up to the overlook near parking lot about 1:00. Did some looking and pics. Hiked about 8 miles today. Then to car, a change of clothes and hit the road home. Stopped for some snacks soon and then drove non stop to Madison. Supper and gas there and home about 8:00.   Will come back here sometime. This is a beautiful park with more trails. Would have liked to do the Escarpment trail which is on a ridge high over the lake. Maybe talk Amy into a rustic cabin someday.",,Porcupine Mountain Wilderness Day 3,"Sep 14, Wed",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551057,"Still tweaking gear, etc. Bought a new light weight sleeping after returning the previous one. Splurged on a Western Mountaineering 35 degree. It only weighs 1lb 8oz and is a little roomier than most. Slept out in tent a couple nights last week. Down to around 40 each night and I was good. May try a cooler night when opportunity. Tent really gets a lot of condensation on bottom side of fly, but nothing drips into the tent proper. I think this is mainly a factor of the cool weather and hopefully will not be that bad on warmer nights.Ended up buying a new stove. BRS Ultralite from Amazon. This little guy is neat and weighs only a couple ounces. Not expensive either. You have to go with the canisters but that makes things easier without having to preheat like I do on my current MSR Wisperlite. And save about 6 - 9 ounces. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NNMF70U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Also starting to think more about food. Need to experiment more with different foods that will be available along the trail. I may try to set up some mail drops. Yet to be determined. Don't really want to buy a bunch of food and then not do / need the mail drops. But if variety on trail is low, then this would be a nice option.",,Gear and Food,"Oct 30, Sun",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551412,"Thinking about what all has to be done here at home while I'm gone. Have the big items out of the way like 1) approval from wife Amy, 2) completing my 3rd term on school board and 3) substitutes for my role as church treasurer. Amy is onboard with this and has been from the start of my thinking about it years ago. She has been listening to me talk about it, been to a number of trail crossings in our travels over the years and plans to support me with visits and other things while on the trail. Couldn't make this work without her. My school board term is done after April 4 elections are official. I'll have to miss my last board meeting in middle of April. Just couldn't wait for that before starting. And thanks to Carl, my duties as church treasurer will be kept up. He's trained and I'll be in contact for any questions that might arise. And there are numerous tasks that I'm trying to get listed and covered. Everything from financial stuff to house maintenance and yard, etc. Finances will be pretty much on autopilot. Amy will just have to handle a few odd bills that come in. Our 100 year old house has a lot of little things that I just do as needed or seasons change. I'll try to get the warm season things done early before I go. And there are always new things which arise. I usually can handle those. These things either Amy can do or she will get help from friend or neighbor. And any new things that pop up we will just deal with as they come.

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552356,"I did a hike today with the cold weather clothes I intend to take at start of hike. Temperature was 22 degrees. Minimal wind. I wore base, mid layers, plus vest and down jacket. Had long underwear and my light weight trail pants. Hat / gloves etc. Happy with results. Was concerned about the legs, but turned out fine. The trail pants are really light, but with the under layer, it was only slightly cold getting started. After 30 minutes I reduced a layer by removing the vest. That was a good sign. Continued to be slightly warm, but did not do anything else. Hands, feet, head were fine with my selected items. I hiked at Silver Springs State Park today. Had my full pack on with 26 lbs or so. Did the 3 mile loop x 2. Also added a couple small side trails to extend about half mile. So 6.5 overall. Got done in right at 2 hours. Have also started walking around town each day. Two to three miles per day. Usually walk to the Y and add some more exercise there on machines.",,Winter Clothes Test Dec 2016,"Dec 10, Sat",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553149,"Hiked today in cold windy and wet weather. Was probably a good example of a not so great weather day on the AT. Low 40's, wind was really blowing, sometimes gusts in the 40's, and raining. I went to Johnson Mound which is a glacial mound about 200 feet high. I think 200's a stretch though. Still a good workout with the up and down's.Started raining when I got to top the first time. So was a good time to put on rain gear. Pack cover on, then pants and coat. I was in this picnic shelter and had a table to use, so better conditions than on the trail. Hiked up and down a couple times and then was hot, so stopped on trail and took off down coat. Had to take off and then back on the rain coat. Ended up hiking a couple hours going up and down the mound 10 times using various routes. Stayed comfortable. I was with pack today. Would have been a really good practice routine to have put up my tent in this. But too bad, did not have it with me! The load I have been practicing with is about right weight and size, but not my real stuff. Just other things to get to that.

Also hundreds of protesters at the O'hare International terminal,protesting the Trump order to stop some people from entry. We went through immigration and customs not knowing on the other side of the wall was the big crowd. I did talk to a couple guys who asked where I came from. They were not that interested in me after said Mexico.I did do quite a bit of walking while vacationing, but not really much of a workout. The place we stayed was large and inherently required lots of walking. I also was up early and walking some mornings along beach, golf course and into town area. Have been walking a lot in January still. When the snow melted a couple weeks ago, was back to the forest preserves with pack on. Tried a couple others and today went to Sannauk for about 3.5 miles with pack. Still have the 'no hills' issue, but that is the nature of where we live. Working on several lists of AT preparations things. Have to keep going on those. Down to under 2 months before leave home.  February 7    I went down to starved rock today.

Although we have in the past regularly been apart for up to 10 days, this is going to be a whole lot more than that. Good thing is that she will visit me the 2nd week of April. And she will get a couple more trips in hopefully. I'm flying to Ft. Myers tomorrow morning and will be with my parents and uncle for a few days.

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558548,"Big day today. Dad mom and I drove up from Atlanta. We stopped at Amacalola Falls State Park where I registered and weighed my pack.   I was number 1485 from Springer. The attendant said that there are many also who do not register. He thought there could be another 1000 through hikers. The pack weighed 34 pounds. From there we drove to Springer Mountain parking lot. Then the three of us walked the 1 mile to the summit. Mom and dad did great. They stopped a little short of the top as it was quite rugged and steep. I went ahead to the top, then came back and we walked to the car together. Then I hiked 3.3 miles to Three Forks where mom and dad pick me up in the car.  We are in Ellijay Georgia tonight. Had a good meal and a soft bed to sleep in. Tomorrow they will take me back to three Forks and I will continue northbound on the trail. Dad and mom will then drive back to Illinois. So good to have them with me today.   Plus the fact that they brought me here.

About 4 miles to park Mountain shelter rain the whole time steady but not hard.   Was fairly comfortable until I stopped at the shelter and started getting cold while I ate a little bit. While there a big downpour.   I was out of the rain mostly, but the shelter was very full and I never really got inside it. Just stayed on the side of the shelter that did not get the rain,overhang was enough to keep me out of it also. Talked to Paul for while we ate and waited for the rain to let up a little. I left a few minutes after him and continued walking in the rain. I warmed up pretty well. After a while the rain let up but the wind came up. Kept on walking through Horse Gap and then up Sassafras Mountain that was the biggest climb of the day. Walked with Paul, Karen and Chris of and on the rest of the day.  After coming back down from Sassafras to Cooper gap was kind of cold again and it was very windy at that point. There were about a half dozen tents set up Cooper Gap and everybody was hunkered down.   I got a little water there and then headed up Justice Mountain by myself.   At the top there was a campsite and the wind was low and rain had stopped.   So I decided that was place for the night. Set up my tent and the rest of camp then checked cell phone and turned out I had service. Talked a few minutes on the phone. Surprised Amy and dad that I was able to call.

Dale sent me some more info to add to the above comments:
I got up before light and packed. Light about 7. Hit trail by 7:30. Beautiful downhill to Justice creek. Got water as I was out. Stopped in a few miles for food. Saw several who had stayed at Gooch Mtn shelter. 
Stopped again on Rimrock Mtn to eat. Great overlook. Then first trail magic at Woody Gap by 4 ladies from GA and Indiana. Beans and weenies fruit and brownies so I ate again. 
Another overlook at Preacher Rock. Passed my goal of Lance Creek where I filled up with water and then camped on a high spot a little farther.

At shelter on top, it started coming down steady. General and I agreed to share a cabin at Neel's Gap. He is hiking with his 8 year old daughter, Asha. Two plus miles down from Blood Mtn. Steep and in the rain made it interesting. But down is better than up for me. Some complain of joints on the downs. Hung around Mountain Crossings store until General and Asha arrived.

Probably 40 people at this shelter and campground last night. Everybody seems to be cold this morning, so I'm no worse than others.
Weather today was just cold and windy but clear and sunny. First few miles were out of the wind and then it shifted to the other side of the mountain and wind really cooled this side down. Kept a good pace stopped a few times but mostly hiking with Jane from Plainfield,IL. Known as Plain Jane.
Came down to Unicoi Gap about 2 o'clock. Was treated to trail magic by a Baptist church group from a town in Georgia about five hours away. Really nice of this group and many others to help hikers. Had a cheeseburger and a Coke and then got an offer from another person there for a ride to the town of Helen so took him up on that.
Found a room in town and went for supper and am now relaxing. Not sure how to get back to trail tomorrow about 9 miles away.   Several other hikers here. Hotel has a shuttle but I may hit traffic because they don't have a very good schedule.
I had planned to stay in town tomorrow night but decided on tonight since it's forecast to be just as cold again. After tonight it warms up, so I'll skip my town stay tomorrow night.
I'm holding myself back a little bit and keeping to about 10 miles/day. That was my plan. I don't want to end up being too tired or hurt. I have one blister I'm dealing with on a toe.
So I plan for the next five days to stay on the trail and then meet Amy on Wednesday near Franklin North Carolina. Can't wait for that!","Low Gap

Would be really nice on a hot summer day. Third was a side falls that did not really match the other two. Was right beside the road and we read something that the road at one time actually went behind the falls. Highlands is an upscale tourist town. We had lunch and Amy shopped some.

Fun to see them that way.   Wemade the 10 miles in five hours. Stopped a bald.   The first big one that I have seen. Probably about 5 acres total.   We climbed up on top of it and had a nice view. Balds are usually on top of mountains. Thought to have been cleared by either Native Americans or early settlers. some people also think maybe they are natural. mostly grass is covering the balds. Amy picked us up at three. She had seen a few sites around the area including a botanical garden in Highlands. Not the first time that we have split up and she went to a Botanical garden.   We stopped at the lazy hiker and had a great time. Quite a few other hikers there that I and Jane knew.

The hardest mile and a half that I've had on the trail so far and of course the rain picked up even more as we went through this section.  Hard to describe it, but there were many times when you had to hold on to something to climb up and also to climb down. Finally got out of this, which really turned out to be kind of fun--now that it's over. After that had another mile and a half to Jerry cabin shelter. At that time the rain really picked up and was blowing. Raced into the cabin and moped around there while the rain continued from about two till four. Trying to decide whether to go on or stay here.  it did clear up and ended up tenting on a nice night at Jerry cabin with lots of good tent sites.A nice breeze for a while which helped dry wet clothes out.

Had about 3 miles of the up to get to a ridge this morning.  And I leveled out for most of the day.  We were going to camp at about 15 miles, but it was early and there was trail magic a road crossing, so we decided to go on.  Never did find the trail magic.Ran into Weather Girl late this morning at a shelter. We've been seeing her most every day for the last couple of weeks. She is a former Air Force weather specialist and is always predicting weather for the AT.  She's a little bit doom and gloom in her predictions.  Maybe she is a TV forecaster. Today she said it was going to storm at about 3 o'clock and she was staying there for the night.  It never did rain.I found a campsite but did not know where White Beard was.  He finally came into camp about seven. He had gone back to look for his tent poles which he had lost.  It was a real problem. We rigged up his tent as best we could.   About that Time the hiker name Skallywag came along and had found his poles.  What a great thing that he had brought them along.So today was the longest day I have hiked with the full pack.  Actually pack is heavier than normal with re-supply from Pearisburg.  Tired. Lesson learned today is to not change plans based on potential for trail magic. I ended up pushing myself a little too hard and White Beard nearly had to turn around and go south today looking for his poles.","Pearisburg, VA

It was 3 miles to Dragon's Tooth but seemed like twice that. Thought we would never get there. Finally did make it and rested for a while.  Then the fun really began when I had to climb down. It was really dangerous holding on to rocks and trying to slide down with  packs on.  I lived to tell the tale.Finally got to the campsite. Set up, ate and went to bed.

I called a shuttle driver and he took me up to the Royal Oaks resort near Reeds gap.  I have a better room here but not a restaurant. Watched a couple movies and rested.
Tomorrow I plan to give it a try hiking. Trail is near the Blue Ridge Parkway all the way to Waynesboro in case I need to pull up again.  Right after  Waynesboro is the beginning of Shenandoah national park.  I've been looking forward to that section.

Got up early and drove out to the trail. Knee not really better but I wanted to hike without my pack.  Went about 2 miles south from Rockfish gap. It's not really that hard to hike but the pain is there on every step.  As planned, I turned around and walked back to where I started. Talked to a few hikers mostly girls in fact. They were all heading to Town.  I offered rides but they weren't there when I got back.
So decision time has come for my hike.   Mom and dad will be here first thing Sunday. I will be with them until Wednesday, and then have a ticket home from DC.  From there I will continue to mend my knee.  
Disappointing at this time, but it's no fun to hike with pain.  Up to this point my pain has been wet, hungry or dirty.  My 800 miles were really fun, and I never had a time when I thought I wanted to stop so I have that to be thankful for.

Shared room with uncle Puck and Cody last night. Rented a car that I picked up in the morning. Took Puck and Cody back to trail after stopping at an outfitter.    Drove around on the Blue Ridge Parkway a little bit.   Stop at the Chinese buffet again. Had lunch with Chip. And talked to catfish a little bit outside. Then drove east to Charlottesville. This is Thomas Jefferson Country.   Have been to his home at Monticello, so went to the campus of University of Virginia which Jefferson designed. Finally found a place to park and walked around the old part of the campus, into the rotunda and then the lawns and range as they are called. It was interesting didn't spend too long there but I am glad I visited.

Uncle Puck and couple other hikers came in about dark last night. Cody and Double D are the other two. I hung out with them until about midnight catching up on a lot of hikers and how it's been going for Uncle Puck.  Routine morning here then walked with uncle Puck and Cody down to Jake's B&G for lunch and more.  They went to the grocery store for resupply and I iced my knee. Had supper at a pizza place down the street. It was good too.  I put some KT tape on my knee today.  Used a YouTube to learn how to apply based on where my knee pain is.  Maybe helping a little bit or hopefully it's just getting better in general.

Amy and I left Philadelphia this morning. Drove up to Pottsville and visited Yeingling brewery, the oldest in the country. Was a good tour in a small and authentic brewery.  Still family owned by the fifth generation of same name.  
At Hamburg I got on the trail with about a half a pack. Had a good work out with some climbs and some Pennsylvania rocks. Hiked a while with Wander.  We caught up on some people that we both knew including Claudio and Old School. I did pretty good at taking it slow.  Bottom line is that I felt good all around including left leg and knee. Amy picked me up about 6 o'clock. I got cleaned up and we went out for a nice meal. Last one together for a while.  
Now for a little bit about what happened the last couple weeks when I was off the trail. Not very exciting but here you go.
On Father's Day June 18 my mom and dad came to Waynesboro,VA and picked me up.  My knee and leg had not gotten any better during my stay there. We spent a couple days in the area and stayed in Front Royal. Toured around the Shenandoah National Park and ran into several hikers that I knew.   Disciple, Kurr Dog, and Tengo Hombre,among others.  Then we went to Washington DC and spent a day seeing a lot of sites.  
On the 21st, I flew to Chicago and back home to Sandwich.  Sure was nice to be home with Amy, in my own bed eating lots of good food, etc. Being home seemed to turn the corner on getting better. Went to the doctor couple times and he help me out with various things. So then my thoughts were on how to get back to the trail. 
Since Amy had planned to come to Philadelphia and meet me, I decided to travel with her and get back on the trail, after spending time in Philly with our friends the Harrington's.  Nice visit with them and seeing many sites around the city, including the Magic Garden (picture) which was all mosaics built from discarded materials on the south side of Philly.

Amy dropped me off about eight.  She had to get back to Philadelphia airport.  Did pretty good pacing myself today.  Stopped for a while at pulpit overlook and then on to Pinnacle rock where I had lunch of left over pasta from dinner last night.   Actually got out stove to heat up since I have extra time.  Morning was lots of rocks but afternoon on smoother trail. 
Eckville shelter has a caretaker in neighboring house.  Flush toilet and an outlet to charge from.  I'm tenting across street with three other tents.  A couple from Germany, Mud and Antique.  Also a section hiker who is a HS teacher in DC.  
Nice day. Warm in evening.  Knee / leg still good.   Went to sleep to sounds of fireworks in the distance.","Reservoir Rd - Hamburg Water Works

Ate breakfast with a couple section hikers going southbound. Got out of camp about eight.  Had a good dose of Pennsylvania rocks for the first few miles. That included some rubble to walk over and then some big furniture size rocks to hop across.  Smoothed out for quite a while after that. The reputation of Pennsylvania rocks is real, but not that much to handle. I do have to be really careful about every step.
Took a good break every hour and tried to eat more than I did yesterday. I had intended on stopping at the Allentown shelter at 7 1/2 miles. Got there about 1 o'clock so decided to go on.  Set my sights on the Blue Mountain restaurant.  Arrived about 4 o'clock and found out they were not open on Wednesdays. Thankfully it was just a couple hundred yards down the road.  They did have a faucet outside so I filled up with water. Water on this stretch has been scarce.  Have to plan ahead.
Went on about a mile and found this campsite so decided to stop rather than a go on and push myself too much. Having a nice night here by myself and will be going to bed early. Temperature is pleasant.  Was a breeze earlier, but now I has died off.  
Not many other hikers that I saw today.","Eckville Shelter

Light sprinkle started when I got up.  Packed quick and all stayed dry.  Made coffee and breakfast and on trail by 7.  Easy hiking for a while then really got tough through Knife Edge and Bear Rocks.  More of the famous PA rocks.  Then easy and again hit rocks over Bake Oven Knob.  Stopped at a shelter for lunch.  Mud and Antique there.  And Trooper.  Rest of day was normal rocks and a big down hill at end.  
Decided to go on to Palmerston today to set myself up for tomorrow.  A giant climb that is extremely steep is first thing, plus I had to come to town for resupply.  Other thing is no water for about 15 miles.  Hitchhiked to town a couple miles.  So here at this hostel with Berries and Loki about my age from MI.  Also Nobody, Gormet, Alex, Mud, and Antique.  Decent place and close to store and food.  Hope to get a ride back to trail in morning.","Stealth camp site past PA Rt309

Started raining about 4 AM. Came down hard for a while. Woke me up from my bunkbed with real sheets. All of us in the bunk room got up about seven and surveyed the rain which was still coming down steady.  In no hurry to get back to the trail but the forecast looks like clearing late morning. I got my things put together.  Then had some breakfast at the restaurant which our bunk room was connected to. Some of the hikers are going to stay for a zero today, but I'm going to hike on, along with Nobody and Alex.  
The owner of the restaurant is giving us a ride back to the trail. She's a fun lady who we talked to a lot last night at dinner. A real joker.  she told us her name was Lucy. Turns out it's not Lucy it's Tracy. She and the rest of the servers had a big laugh on us last night and this morning over this, along with some other things. You can tell she appreciates the hikers by what she does with her bunkhouse, rides etc. So I recommend Berts restaurant for food and a bunk overnight.  Overnight for hikers that is.  I do not think others would appreciate as much as I did.
The rain did stop.  First thing was the much anticipated rocky climb out of Lehigh gap. There was a lot of steep climbing.  I strapped my poles to the backpack so that I would have my hands free to grab rocks and pull up. A couple times I was actually scared. The pack on the back really makes you off-balance.  But overall it was easier than I thought, mainly because the actual amount of hand climbing was less than anticipated. Made the mile climb in just under an hour.  Forgot my white blaze prayer at bottom so prayed at the top that I had safely made the climb.
Next was the 4 mile bypass around the Superfund site which is a cleanup of zinc mining I believe. Smaller trees were growing but mainly it was just scrub vegetation. It was hot and humid today after the rain. After that was routine hiking over Pennsylvania rocks but little technical stuff. I stopped at this campsite and had a nice night. About dusk threatened rain, but has not yet.  Water is still scarce.  Carried water to last me all day and overnight. Have a source in the morning where I will fill up and have the same situation tomorrow.
All for now. Got a little long tonight. Leg and knee still feeling good. I am practicing the recommendations from Dr. J, including rolling my muscles, massaging some pressure points, and deep breathing.  And oh yeah, I am taking it slower and resting more during the day.","Palmerston, PA.

Nice morning.  Cooler.   Had planned to hitch hike about a mile down a paved road to a hostel for water but it was not well traveled so went on.  Will have to make it to next shelter where water is long way down a side trail. Hiked with Yenzer for a couple miles. His name is slang for some folks near Pittsburgh with a certain accent.  He was from Pittsburgh but did not have the accent.  Later I texted friend Polly in Philadelphia who is from Pittsburgh to ask if she is a yenzer.  She replied 'Absolutely Not!'  So I think I get it now!   
I got to shelter and did the half mile side trail to water.  Filtered 4.5 liters and back up hill to shelter.  Had lunch and drank a liter.  So will be carrying 3.5, almost 8 lbs. But need for tonight and day tomorrow.   Not sure of available water until where I want to camp Sunday.

Cool again this morning.  Hiked down into Windgap and then back up again. Got a little water from a trial magic jug.  Rocks are still really bad.  Very annoying.  Slow going.   Will be glad to get out of these rocks in a few more days. Fortunate that I had planned to go slow because I am being more careful. I'm afraid if I had wanted to make more distance I would be more at risk to fall or twist an ankle.  This way my feet are the only thing getting sore.  The more technical rocks with climbing and scrambling are actually a nice break from the flat trail scattered with rocks.  
They say it happens to every through hiker at least once..... I climbed up wolf rocks to the Overlook. And proceeded to head right back down the way I came up. I was going south back the way I had come!  With the level terrain and all these rocks everything looks the same. No landmarks. When I saw a couple day hikers that I had spoken to before, I knew something must be wrong and asked them. Sure enough.  We all had a good laugh. I turned around and 10 minutes later I was back where needed to be again.  Found the right way and went on across the rest of Wolf rocks.  Much more interesting hiking the rocks this time.
Lots of day hikers at Wolf Rocks also. Went on north to the parking lot where they were coming from and on to a shelter for water, just a short distance to where I am camping. Short day tomorrow into Delaware Water Gap. Will stay at hostel at a Presbyterian Church. Then meeting Gustafson's there on Tuesday.","Hanns Overlook campsite W of Wind Gap, PA.

Today was day of rock walls and board walks. I must've walked over 25 rock walls. Of course they are in rubble condition now but I'm sure at one time they were functional.  And maybe they farmed in this area so the rocks were piled up out of the fields.  And the boardwalk over the swamps are numerous.  Have to be careful with these as they are very very slippery,but better than walking through the mush.

I snagged a bottom one.  Places to hang stuff and shelves.  77 is in loft.  Should be good sleeping unless bugs get bad.  Weather clearing tonight. Hope for good day tomorrow.  
My couscous was not great tonight.  Added some oil, spices and cheese but not much help. Ended up giving half of it to a southbounder.  Not going hungry. Other things to eat.","Great Barrington, MA.

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573545,"Got going early out of the shelter.   A couple big mountains but made pretty good time in the morning. Hiked with the people including Blue Deer and Turtle. Mostly by myself though.  Stop for lunch at Shaker campsite.  
Not long after lunch I took a pretty good fall. It was on some sloping rock and I just slipped on a wet spot. My left leg buckled under me and I fell onto my side. Didn't feel too bad at the time but when I went to bed I realized I hurt my side when I fell and landed on my arm.  A few days ago in the heavy rain I had a near miss fall caught myself with my left arm and then rolled to my right on the other arm. My butt never hit the ground so it does not count. Probably should've just gone down because I was already soaking wet.
Decided to hike onto the Goose Pond Cabin mainly because there were no other options to camp and in Massachusetts it is against the rules to stealth camp.   So I forged on and made it to the site at 6 PM. Even got half a bonus mile from the AT back to the cabin.   Longest day I've had since back on the trail.  Feet a little sore and I am tired as expected.
At least 60 or 70 people here at this campsite. There is a full on cabin with a host family and bunks for 18. And of course lots of tent sites. With the southbounder now and us north bounders also.  It makes for a crowd.Had my supper and socialized a little bit then went on to bed.

Hiked with Trail Mix for a while.  He bought 150 pounds for the trail.  That's about a pound a day!  Needless to say he has not stuck with that diet. Lots of boggy areas with planks.  I like the rough cut curved boards.  Hiked about 11 miles and had lunch on a bench.  Then down road a short way to the cookie lady's house.  Had a couple cookies from her and talked a while.

Ended up with a full shelter last night. I moved to the upper bunk so that Berries and Loki could share the bottom bunk which was bigger.  Also here were Xena and Venture. And a southbound German girl.  There was also a ridge runner.
Took another fall today. A root jumped up and tripped me. I went down hard. Nothing hurt. My hiking poles were tangled up in my pack. 
Got to Dalton about 830 after 3 miles. Went to a convenience store and resupplied for two days. I walked a couple blocks along the trail and stopped to organize my food. Hey guy came by and asked me if I needed anything. I said yes I would like to throw away my trash and get some water. He told me his address and I went there. Nice guy. Also changed my pants in his backyard. Maybe that is TMI.   Hiked a quick 9 miles to Cheshire. Met a guy named Forest who I have not met before. Stopped in Cheshire at an ice cream place. Had a Coke and ice cream.  Talked to a guy name Mellow Yellow and to Scramble who had stayed the night before at the shelter. Walked on from there with Checklist and Trailname.
Then started up Mount Greylock trail. Greylock is the highest mountain in Massachusetts and also the highest mountain I have been across since Virginia.  Partway up a couple asked me if I was a thru hiker.  I said yes and they said would you like ice cream.  Of course I would.  They had through hiked a few years ago and were out doing trail magic.
Hiked on up to the shelter. Tough going. At the shelter were 77, Five year plan, and a sobo group of three cute blonde girls and a lucky companion name Bear.  They had a name to go with that but I don't remember. Also another youth group from the same camp as last night. This group was much more social and we talked a lot at supper. All from New York City.  I enjoyed listening to them debate about which was better.  Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, and so on.  I shared a sleeve of Oreos and made their night.

I hiked on up to the summit of Greylock Mountain.  There is a CCC lodge there with a restaurant and a few rooms. I would like to go back there someday.  I had a Coke with Xena and Venture, Walked on up to the summit.   Took a picture and then climbed to the top of the tower.  Nice view from here.
Now I was focused on getting to town and the hotel that I have reserved.  Moved fast mostly downhill. Passed a few hikers and then stopped for lunch because I was really getting hungry.  Then hurried on down to the Trail head and walked to the Papa John's nearby. This is run by a former Hiker who gives 50% off to thru hikers. Got a big pizza and called the motel who came to pick me up.

I climbed the fire tower and took a couple pictures. Was looking down at the fog sometimes other times it was clouds blowing through.
Back at the bottom I decided to dry my tent. Set up tent and draped the fly over part of the fire tower structure. As I was waiting for that, who should walk up but Roo. Really happy to see her. Met her hiking companion U Turn from Kansas City. We shared plans. I decided hike to Manchester Center with them today rather than wait till tomorrow. Called the hostel and changed my reservation.  
Hiked the roughly 15 miles to the highway by about 4 PM.   Hitched a ride into Manchester Center.  Nice having two girls to stick thumbs out and get rides.  Got delivered to a bar and Grill.

Did 3 miles up to top of Bromley Mtn. Quick and easy.   Last half mile was on a ski slope.  Chair lift at top and a warming hut that hikers can stay in.  Nice place with 4 walls and a door.  Hikers who stayed there liked it.   Trail angel who had hiked to top gave us a donut and bar.  Nice lady named 46 and 2 who hiked last year.  Back down and then up to Styles peak which was more challenging but not as high.  On to Peru Peak shelter for lunch which was 10 miles in.

Other hikers around.  Mostly day hikers. Some went on to top to see views, etc.  Made some plans, got water, and packed up for hike down. About 5 minutes into it I heard a girl calling after me.  Someone had stolen her pack she left in shelter while climbing to top.  Felt so bad.  She was in tears.  The girl ran on ahead and then returned.  She did still have phone but that was about it.   Later I got a text from her that police had caught the thief.  This is practically unheard of on the trail.  Even in town.  Sure glad ended this way.  She was a sobo thru hiker.

Rested for a while and then hitch hiked into town of Killington.  Went to an outfitters.  They could not fix my hiking poles. I did end up buying a new mid layer shirt/jacket and a dry sack for clothes.  Walked up to a deli and grocery. Picked up what I needed for three days and two nights and a sandwich from the deli.
Then I took a side trail back to the AT and hiked south back to the highway where I had ended earlier.  Challenging navigation with several side rails and the fact that I was going south. Also the Long trail turned away from the AT and headed north. So there will be no more Long trail hikers.  Tomorrow I will hitch back to the town and start from that point.

Slack pack today.  Stopped at a bagel place in town then to the trail head, heading south today.  At trailhead met up with the Warrior Expedition hikers. I have been hiking with Hook, Swiss Miss and Jaws lately.  Found out they have a van that a guy was there with.  They are raising money for vets who want to hike and walk to be better.  


Hiked up starting at 8:00.  Very steep and parallel to Beaver Brook which was cascading down. Pretty, but I was focused on the first mile of climbing the trail.  Lots of stone steps and some wood wedges attached to the rock faces to step on.  Climbed about 4 miles and 3000 feet.   Worked up a sweat going up but as soon as broke the tree line all hell broke loose.  Winds of at least 30 and gusts 40. Cloud banks,cold and wet.  I put on my mid layer jacket and then shortly after, the puffy down coat.  Walked the quarter mile to summit leaning into wind.  Took some pics and then got down behind wind breaks.  


Lunch and rested until  11:00 then started down.  Level for a mile in alpine shrubs which broke the wind some.  Took side trail to south summit and by that time some lifting of clouds.  Got some nice views in between clouds.  Ran into Xena and Venture coming up.  Should see them again tomorrow.  Made it to trail head about 2:00.  Ralph there to pick us up.  This is really nice having a shuttle car and driver.  Back to cabin for a while.  Out to dinner and did resupply shopping.  Organized food later and called it a good day.   


Happy to be over first White Mtn summit and ready to move on.  Two day segment next to Franconia Notch.  16 miles, so hopefully comfortable enough.  After that, longer stretches.  Weather is the main factor.  Tomorrow looks good.  Friday not so.  Figure on going out regardless.","Glencliff / Lincoln NH. 0 miles.

Thinking today of friend and former coworker Dave Strode who died too young at 58.  A good man.  Retired with me and many others who have been making the most of our next chapter in life.  Also makes me thankful for the AT trip I'm on.  
Second day in the Whites.  Steep long climb to Wolf Peak and down 3 miles to Eliza Brook shelter.  Had lunch there.   Then the dreaded climb up to Kinsman Mtn.  Actually south peak and then north peak after descent and smaller climb.  The dreaded climb was up rock shoots which required hand holds and using trees to pull yourself up when available. Great clear views though. Weather was good. 
Squeezed tents onto a single wooden platform at the shelter.  Tight fit but made it work.  Very little level ground.  And if level, full of rocks.  Platform is about 5ft off ground on high side and at ground on other.  Bambam and LIttle Bad Ass here too.  Saw them a lot today.  LBA is a good kid.  Good hiker too.  
Whites are considered about the hardest on the AT.  Going between Notches.  Huge climbs and descents out of and into them. 3 more main notches to go.  Looking at about 10 days to Gorham NH.  These days will be lower miles.  Feel good about the 11.5 today.  Will be lots of day hikers in this popular area too.  Will visit the 'huts' starting tomorrow.  Will describe them starting then.

Huts are run by the Appalachian Mtn Club (AMC) Or Appalachian Money Club.  To stay at the hut you hike in and for $100 plus per person you get a bunk, no linens,a bathroom, no shower, and meals, which I hear are very good.  We thru hikers get to maybe come in and buy coffee, soup, and baked stuff which we are happy for.  We also may get free left overs if timing is right.  The ' Croo' runs the place.  Thru hikers may get to 'work for stay'.  More about that later.  
Raining hard while at hut.  Decided to hike on down and then call Ralph for pick up.  Made it down in a couple hours and walked about a mile to a parking lot.  Got picked up, stopped for lunch and back to cabin.  Later to Littleton, NH for laundry and shopping.  I bought a new hiking tee and belt and some gloves.  Later had pizza.  
Back at cabin organized for another hike out.  Planning 3 days on Franconia Ridge.  Thinking to go Sobo and let the weather clear by the time to get to the most scenic part which will be Monday.  That would have been tomorrow,if Nobo and not expected to be clear.   Once again sure nice to have the rides with Ralph not to mention the cabin to sleep and dry out.","Kinsman Pond shelter

Decided to go for a camp site on the top of Zealand Mtn.  Another climb up higher.  Quite a few day hikers in this stretch and some 'hut to hut' folks.  Found the site about 3:00.  Early, but this is best known place to camp.  Not really that great a site.  In the trees so views are minimal.  


Set up and then had supper. Several hikers stopped by and talked, then moved on.  They were mainly doing 4000'ers.  That is a goal for many New England hikers to summit the forty some peaks over 4000.  This one is at about 4100.

Smaller but nicer hut.  More room in bunks.  I'm on bottom this time.  Nice.  Supper good.  I was surprised with a birthday cake with single candle.

Got away from hut a little after eight.  Climbed to top of Madison.  5366ft Rocky climb.  Then the long descent from Madison and the whole Mt Washington complex started.  All steep rock hopping and careful steps.  About 3 hrs to do the 3 miles.  Once below tree line was easier but still tough.  My knees have begun to hurt on long descents.  Not too bad and recover at night.  


Took a break half way down and another for lunch about 2 miles from Pinkham Notch which was primary destination for day.  Lunch was at Mt Washington road crossing.  A few cars stopped at pullout.  Some taking short hikes after trip to top.  Last 2 miles easy on an old road bed.  At Visitor center Gota soda and talked with hikers Venture and Xina who were heading to Gorham.  See them most days for last month or so.  From NW of Indianapolis.  Also with a couple who were at hut from Chattanooga.  Not thru hikers.

Steep down for a couple miles but nothing like late yesterday coming off North Carter.   Crossed Rattle river and then nice hike on down it for several miles to highway.  Stopped once for early lunch.  Hot Sauce and ZipLock passed me then.  They came to camp area late last night.

Lost my shorts this morning.  What a start.  How did I do that?   I thought maybe an animal drug them away.  I know no other hiker would want them.  So I looked and fretted but did not find.  Thankfully I have some long hiker pants otherwise would have been my long underwear. Stay tuned for the conclusion to this trail mystery.  


After a couple miles came to the exciting Mahoosuc Notch.  What fun coupled with death defying climbs and descents.  I was able to keep my pack on all the way through.   Others had to remove to crawl through slots.  My strategy was to go up and over but with greater danger.  Took almost two hours.  Took time and enjoyed.  Check out the other pictures in the picture section of my journal.  


Next was the climb up Mahoosuc Arm.   That might have been the most unfun section of the trail.  Just steep and long.  Maybe more tired coming in.  Finally made it to top.  Discussed options and called The Cabin to see if could get pickup at Grafton.  Yes!   


Plan is to slack pack and maybe zero out of the Cabin.  Have heard great things about the place.  So will be there 4 nights and slack about 35 miles in 3 days hiking.   


Hiked on to Grafton Notch.  Long downhill.  Knees aching.  Picked up by hostel about four.  Stopped at convience store.  Shower and a wonderful family meal with about ten hikers and hostel family.  Great!   Bed comfortable in bunk room with four others.  


Really staying tired and aches every day.  Hope these slack pack days help.  Motivated to finish this journey though.  Maine is staying just as difficult as NH.  Ten mile days will be the norm for a while.  Am eating more it seems.  Always hungry and always eating.   This family style meals for a few days will be good.

Cold windy cloudy morning.  Got colder and windy as I climbed.  Wanted to stop at Baldpate shelter for a rest and out of wind after a couple hours but missed the side trail to it.  Realized this when I arrived at top of Baldpate west peak.  Got out of wind in some trees and put on puffy coat pants stocking hat and gloves.  Headed down saddle and to the bare approach to higher Baldpate east peak.  Wind really picked up here and all way across the bald Mtn.  Probably 50mph.  Had to use hands to maintain solid on the rock.  Really something.  More than I had on top of Moosalacke a couple weeks ago.  This time not in clouds at least.  Had that feeling of impaired breathing sometimes.  Like on a ride or in an open vehicle or back of a truck with face into the air blast.  Made it over top.  Going down was less into the wind and then below the alpine zone got back into tall tree forest and lower wind.  
Met up with Venture on climb but he moved ahead faster to get out of wind.  Xena not with him.  She had slowed down and is a day behind.  Stopped at Frey Shelter for lunch.  Darren and scuba Steve and Venture there.  I had brought a new log book and roll of toilet paper from hostel owner Bear.  He likes to do these things as good will for hikers.  Also picked up a few minor trash items and brought them out.  Easy to do these things when slack packing.

Next was The Horn. Coming down off it was awful.  Wet and steep.  I fell 2 times in first few drops.  I learned my lesson and did not attempt sloped rock faces with just my foot grip.  My falls were just landing on my butt/pack and sliding several feet to a stop in brush or just bottom of rock.

13 miles over two mountains at 4000+ is a grind but weather is bad and a better roof over my head motivates.  Was concerned about a stream ford at 5 miles but there was a board over the main part of it.  Still had to boulder hop to get to board and then finish crossing.  Not a big deal as it turned out.  


Light rain all day.  Tried out my umbrella that attaches to head.  Marginally successful.  Hits top of my pack when look up so will have to be a downhill and level ground device.  Crocker Mtns were the challenge.  Climbed 2000 to south Crocker.

Stopped for a rest after 6 miles at Pierce Pond Lean To.  Nice place but cool due to wind coming off Pond.  My camp last night was sitting on west side and did not get wind thankfully.  Had to walk over a long rough dam of boulders with a wood dam of sorts propped against the stone.  This evidently raised the level of Pierce Pond.  Then about 3 miles along Pierce Pond Stream.  Another pretty area with small falls and some smooth water.   As said before this is a nice area.  


Came to Kennebec River and waved to ferry operator on other side.  Canoe came and I was on other side before long.  Swift river and gets swifter when upstream dam releases.  That can be at any time so ferry is the safe method.  Hiked another half mile to hostel.  Here by 1:00.  This is the way I like it.  Plenty of time to get things done and relax a little.

Hiked 5 miles to a road and wow, trail magic.  A lady who had lived in Wheaton and has been to Sandwich fair.  Small world.  Had coffee and donut and a sweet bread slice.  Moved on and over Pleasant Pond Mtn.  Clear skies and good views.  One more Mtn out of the way.  Not too many more before Katahdin.  


Stopped for a break and replied to texts from a couple people including Bob McW who is riding the storm out in his family's condo in Daytona area. He's about 8 stories up and the path appears to be on west side of state. Sounds interesting.  


Trail is definitely getting easier.  Get some stretches that are smooth now but still mostly covered with roots and rocks.  Long ups and downs are less numerous.  I also am in a mood of over the hump and on the home stretch. I'm feeling good and able to move faster with better terrain.  I did take a couple more falls today as have been happening.  One scared me.  A pole hung up on a root and spun me around to fall on my back down hill.  Soft landing on pack.  Have been having the sticks catching more.  Wish I could grind down the part that is catching. 
Later in the afternoon I came to another road and two guys were packing up more trail magic.  Just missed hot dogs.  Oh well, had just eaten lunch.  Did take a bag of potato chips they offered.  Sure is a great state for trail magic. Got to my camp site a little before five.  Talked to some people and did my routines.  Getting dark earlier.  No more getting in tent before dark.

Moxie is Another nice mountain top with tons of bald rock.  Cool and windy here this early.  I found a place out of wind and talked to Amy.  Had to make several calls as kept losing the connection.  After that, Moxie and Tumbleweed got there so took some pics.  She also brought up a can of Moxie soda to drink for the occasion.  It's a local cola with an extra taste that makes it a little different.  


I went on down.  Lots of pretty views.  Stopped at Moxie Pond for a short break.  Campsite here was really nice.  On to some trail magic from Energizer Bunny who is slack packing his 50 something daughter Frogger up to Katahdin.  Have seen Frogger quite a bit the last 2 weeks.  She is often going south so easy to cross paths. And have had trail magic from dad previously.  They are from Orlando so got an update on hurricane from him.  


A few more miles to the Piscataquis River crossing that looked like would require wading but I rock hopped to a sketchy log across middle and made it dry.

Shuttle back to the trail and hiking by 8:45.  Called Amy from trailhead for one last time.  Got the obligatory picture of the 100 mile wilderness sign about having enough provisions for 10 days.  Many hikers are planning less than me.  Hope they have some extra food.  I also contacted a camp that is about 5 days in.  I had been invited there by the host I had stayed with at a home in Hanover, NH.  Her husband runs the camp.  I'll probably stop there on Sunday night.  Sounds like a neat place.  


Average hiking to start things.  Stopped at Wilson Falls for lunch. Pretty place.  Lots of ponds today.  Many thanks to the beaver. And sometimes where the beaver pond is filling in.  Then came to  Big Wilson Stream.  This was a real ford.  I took off shoes and socks and attempted.  Too hard on feet and water at knees.   Dug through pack to get camp shoes.  With them and a different shallower spot, made it.  Will keep my camp shoes easier to get at.

Wow. Under 100 miles to go.  Really sinking in now.  Today was advertised to be the hardest of the 100 Mile wilderness and I sure hope it was cause it definitely was hard.  Started out with good climb up to Barren Ledges. Good views and first time I really noticed the amount of fall color from above.  Then on up to Barren Mtn.  This was the highest but not hardest of the day.  Rested and talked to Pockey.  Met him in shuttle from hostel and we hiked together a short time yesterday.  I did not see him after we stopped at the falls.  He explained this morning that he hiked from the falls the wrong way.  Over an hour before he met someone he knew and got straight.  Tough way to start this section.  


Today is the Chairback mountains.  Barren was first and then started into a series of additional peaks.  None very high, but all had good views and steep up and downs.  There was a bog at bottom of one.  A section hiker alerted me to a parasitic plant there.  Got some pics.  I'm sure Amy will identify more specifically. (AH- A carnivorous Pitcher Plant- very nice!)


I started getting tired after lunch.  Leap frogged with Pockey several times. He was tired also but got ahead of me after lunch.  Got to Chairback Gap lean to about 3:30.  Was surprised to see Pockey staying for night.  Also Ski Pole with him.  Both are about my age.  


I decided to go on to this campsite.  Seemed easy enough and about 3 miles. I should have known better.  First went up over The Chairback Mtn.  Easy up but the down was hard and dangerous.  Got past that and then just seemed a long way to the campsite.  Finally made it.  No one else here.  I set up and had supper.  Went down by pond and sat a while as it got dark.  Thinking about how this journey is nearing the end.  About that time Venture came in. Xena is usually with him but not today.  Saw her in Monson so not far behind.  We talked a while but getting dark so hiker bedtime.

Downhill to a road called Katahdin Ironworks this morning.  Was hoping to see Frogger dad there with trail magic but just a rumor.  Easy walk a mile to West Branch Pleasant river.  Changed shoes and waded across.  Filtered water and talked to a couple who had camped there. Forgot names.  


Five mile gradual climb mostly along a brook to a Lean To and then a final steep assent to Gulf Hagas Mtn.  Mostly covered with R and R so was not real fast but made good time. Back down and then up to West peak where I had lunch. Lots of steps built into trail.  Always appreciate those.  Next Mtn was Hay and then Whitecap, highest in 100 mile wilderness at 3650.  Just above tree line.  That is getting lower as moving north.  


Leap frogged with Ski Poles several times.  He is not at this shelter so went farther today. Pockey caught up at top of Whitecap.  Talked a while and then split up on way down.  He is here staying in Lean To.  Several others here. Sun is only one I have known before.  


Autumn colors evident again today.  Seem to be more widespread now from above.  And could see Katahdin as came down Whitecap so guidebook says. Just not sure which peak it was from a viewpoint.  As I get closer it will be more apparent.  Much taller than rest.  Next 4days in wilderness are expected to be easier.  Today hard but nothing like yesterday.","East Chairback Pond Campsite

Hiked slower in the morning but mainly due to stops.  Contact lens problem that I finally got straightened out and then a stop to air/dry my sleeping bag. I've been troubled throughout this trip with sweats at night. And that leaves bag damp.  Usually airs out good enough in the evening but still needs good dry time every so often. Usually that is a motel or hostel.  


Mid day got a good stretch done that was really smooth.  Can make 3 miles an hour on that.  Late lunch and then miles seemed to drag but got to tent site sooner than expected.  This is a gorgeous place.

Also happened to be at right place right time when fisherman let me out.  Got a boat ride to camp from their parking lot.  Beautiful old wood canvas freight canoe with motor.  Nate the worker here took me out a little farther in the lake to see Katahdin in the distance.  This time very evident.  Nate showed me to my yurt and I unpacked and rinsed hiking clothes out in lake.  No electric or plumbing, but what's new!

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585506,"Started cloudy, a little windy on top of the mountains, but warmed up quickly once I got on the trail. A few hikers along the way. Only thru hikers I met were Tea Time and Peak who were from the DC area. They are hiking sobo, doing a flipflop started in Duncannon PA back in February. Ran into several days of snow early but have made it through the worst it seems. Amy and I gave them a ride into Buena Vista to the Food Lion. Understand how wonderful it is to catch a ride to town, so thankful to be able to do that for others now that we have our car with us. Really liked walking across bald on Tar Jacket Ridge(see picture in photo areas) Stopped for lunch near Cow Camp Gap Shelter. Wildflowers beginning to bloom in lower elevation, not much happening above 3000 feet elevation. Amy, on the other hand, saw many wildflowers on her trip to the Natural Bridge State Park.  The rock formation rises 215 foot and forms an arch over Cedar Creek. It was first surveyed by George Washington, yes-- THE George Washington and Thomas Jefferson actually bought the property for 22 shillings from King George III. That Tom Jefferson knew how to make land deals. We ended our Easter Day by going out to eat at the Southern Inn in downtown Lexington. Great finish for the first day. Big day tomorrow- a 17 miler. Luckily my ride will be at the end to pick me up.","VA 60. Beuna Vista, VA

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585591,"The Chevy Equinox made it up the mountain to Salt Log Gap again.  Muddy this morning with rain overnight.  Not raining when Amy let me out, but very foggy.  Stayed foggy all day, especially at the higher elevations.  Put rain gear on.  Removed jacket later, but left pants on.  I hiked strong for a couple hours and 5.5 miles to a shelter.  Stopped for a while to eat and drink.  Then on up to Spy Rock.  Climbed up, but the views were not good.  Had trouble coming down and finding my way back to the trail.  The Priest was next mountain.  Long rocky climb up to top, and again no views.  Las leg of day was long trip down mountain to Rt 56 where Amy picked me up.  
Saw very few hikers today.  Three boy scouts early.  Some day hikers near Spy Rock and just one section hiker.  No thru hikers.  
I met up with Amy and we drove to our Airbnb in nearby Avon for the next 4 nights.  Cleaned up and went down road to famous hiker brewery Devils Backbone.  Had good meal and back for night.  I'm ready for some sleep now.  
Amy's day, after dropping off Dale, started with a trip to Crabtree Falls for short hike and then to Cyrus McCormick Farmstead. This outing seemed slightly sacrilegious, having lived in the land of the Plano Reapers for many years now. Hate to disappoint the people of the great state of VA, but good ol' Cyrus did not INVENT the reaper all by himself. He added to the idea from the 1861 manufacture of the grain harvester  by brothers Charles and W.W. Marsh and George and Lewis Steward of Plano that first manufactured the Marsh Harvester. William Deering joined the firm and brought in the addition of an automatic binding attachment for the harvesters. From there, Deering buys the operation and moves to Chicago, teams up with McCormick and you have the McCormick-Deering reaper, which later becomes International Harvester Co.","Salt Log Gap

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585669,"After a 3000 foot drop at the end of yesterday, it was of course, a lot of climbing to start today. First stop at Harper's Creek Shelter, then continued the long climb to Three Ridges mountaintop at 3959. Stopped again at Chimney Rock. Sun came out about that time, had been cloudy/foggy much as the same the last couple of days. Coming down from 3 Ridges, stopped at Hanging Rock. Clouds moved back in and wind picked up, about 30 minutes later, light rain--not enough to put on rain gear. Past the Maupin Field Shelter and Meadow. Lots of good camp spots here. One last climb before final descent to Reeds Gap.
Amy surprised me and met me about 1/2 mile from end. Hiked together back and the sun came out. Met up with Jelly Knee and Bamboo at the parking lot. Had talked to them yesterday at Rt. 56. They are hiking sections. Thank you Jelly Knee & Bamboo for the PBRs and chairs to sit in.

",Reeds Gap,"Apr 03, Tue",10.70
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585760,"Jumped ahead to starting point today because last year I hiked the 12 mile stretch from Reed's Gap to Humpback Gap. First several hours in morning was a nice hike near the BlueRidge Parkway. Weather was warm, with one little sprinkle. Talked to day hiker who had thru-hiked SOBO in 1990. He had written a book that included a stretch of highway on I-80 down by Ottawa that was used as a testing site for surface materials. Both Amy and I knew exactly where that stretch of highway is and had always wondered why the signs for experimental paving were there. His book is entitled, ""The Big Roads- History of the Interstate Highway System"". When I got to Rockfish Gap where BRP ends and Skyline drive begins, I blew into Shenandoah National Park, with winds picking up and gusting to 50 mph. Fortunately, it was a west wind and I was heading north, so although it wasn't exactly pushing me, it was better than walking into it head on. Temps stayed around 50 and I stayed warm with three layers on top, shorts on bottom.
Winds had toppled the outhouses at Beagle Gap. Amy saw the PPP(porta-potty professional) uprighting them and hosing them down. Don't know how much this guy makes a year, but pretty sure he's underpaid, especially on days like today. Highest mountain today was Bear's Den. Communication towers were singing in the wind on top of this mountain today. Also found a fire ring encircled by tractor seats. Somebody getting creative and reusing the tractor seats. Might not be that comfortable, but they were clever. (see photos)
Finished the day about 4:00 and headed to the Ming Garden Chinese Buffet, which may qualify as the best chinese buffet east of the Mississippi. This is a real compliment, because I am not a big chinese buffet fan, but this one is a pleasant exception.","Humpback Gap Blue Ridge Parkway

Had to put on my down coat and kept that on until around 11:00am. Trail was nice and smooth and not as many rocks as yesterday. Was able to walk with a good stride. Stopped to talk to Hammer and Nails, a man and dog team. Hammer was the dog. Shared my water with the dog,as they were running low. Nails is planning a south bound thru hike starting in July, so he was doing practice hike. Not long after that, met up with Cheesesteak and another guy. Doing a flip-flop thru-hike. starting at Harper's Ferry. 
Climbed up to Black Rock summit where I met up with a school group of 8th grade/freshman. Nice views, clear. Stopped for lunch and met up with Klank, another SOBO flip-flopper. Hikers today were planning to get to Waynesboro by Friday and zero there due to snow in forecast. Reached Doyle River Trail in plenty of time to meet back up with Amy.
Amy spent the day in Gordonsville, VA checking out the shopping and a very cool old hotel that served as a military hospital during the Civil War. We fixed up a plastic container that we have filled with trail magic goodies to leave further north tomorrow. Checked out another of the many breweries that are popping up all over this Shenandoah Valley and back to our AirBnb for our last night here.

Warmer today, best day so far. Wind was moderate. Hiked around the Loft Mountain Campground complex. It was not opened yet for the season. Dropped way down to Ivy Creek, followed by a series of ups and downs. Ups seemed tougher today than what I've experienced the past few days. Shenandoahs have been pretty tame, wide and smoother trails, not as steep as other parts I've experienced. Stopped and ate lunch at Simmons Gap, then long climb up and down to Powell Gap. At Powell Gap several winter blowdowns of multiple trees. Thankfully trail maintenance had cleaned them up.Next got to Smith Roach Gap where Amy had left trail magic in a plastic tub. Not many hikers today, so not too much was consumed--maybe a Moon Pie or two. Finished going up over High Top Mtn and then down to Rt. 33 where I met Amy.Moved to a new Airbnb that is pretty special.

",Highway 33/Swift Run Gap,"Apr 06, Fri",19.60
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586036,"Started today in the mid-20's with some wind. Cold, but I was dressed warm, even though no long johns necessary. The breeze got calm and snow started up around 11:00. Light at first and then more as day progressed. Never put on my raincoat, but snow was falling off of my puffy coat. Buff around neck and ears has been a good combination with my hat to keep warm. Best part of the hike today was over Bear Fence Mtn. There was a loop trail around the top of the mountain that was a good way to see the mountain and lots of exposed rocks. Some scrambling over the top. 
Stone work, probably done by CCC, shored up the sides of the trail in many places. Went around Lewis Mtn cabins. A few people car camping there. There was a walk-in cabin called Pocosin. People were there because I saw smoke coming out of the chimney. Would have been the place to be on this cold day. Met up with a couple who were planning a 70 mile section hike. They were turning back to their car after a very cold night at Bear Fence Mtn Shelter. Other than that just a few hardy day hikers today.  
By the time I got to my destination around 3:00, the ground was turning white. Amy picked me up and we had a relaxing evening eating our leftover German sausages from the Bavarian Chef restaurant last night along with some baked beans we had brought along. Our plan was to do trail magic with it, but with so few hikers, that has not panned out. 
Amy's day included stops at 2 pottery places and the Plow & Hearth Outlet Store, which may be as close to a gardener's heaven as one can get. For those not familiar with Plow & Hearth, it's an on-line catalog that features everything from outdoor wicker furniture, trellises and tomato supports to gardening tools. Amy will return there tomorrow as well, since the cold of today kept her from seeing it all.
We are enjoying the interesting names of the gaps, hollows, and overlooks in this section. Here are some of our favorites: Naked Creek, Smith Roach, Ivy Creek, Bacon Hollow, Hazeltop Mtn, Rocky Top(not in Tennessee), Beagle Gap. Wish we knew the origins of the names, but so many are unique and creative we are sure they all have stories to tell.","Highway 33/Swift Run Gap

Amy was driving and when she went to get out the driver's door would only open about 6"". Snow was coming down, and when we reached the entry gate, found out southbound Skyline Drive was closed for plows. Luckily, we were heading north and so I started on today's hike and Amy headed back to Illinois. I spent the night in a shelter with 3 others: Farmer, and his daughter, and a guy named Cup. Also renting, is Purple and I imagine some mice are around. 
Cold is the word. Probably about 30 degrees, which is where the thermometer stayed all day. Light snow most of the day, so ground is white, but no real accumulation. After Amy let me out, I hiked about 5 miles before catching Purple. Had been following tracks for quite awhile, so I knew someone was ahead of me. Talked awhile and I went ahead. Stopped at Elk Wallow Wayside. They were open to my surprise. Serving food, but nowhere to eat inside, so I decided to just eat my own food outside. 
Got cold pretty quick. Put on rain gear for extra warmth. Good climb after this, so warmed right up. Arrived at shelter around 5:00pm. Others trickled in. Supper was good--a trail favorite- Knorr Teriyaki with Fritos and some of the new cheese I am trying called cotija cheese. Similar to grated Parmesan, but really lasts a long time.

Purple slow and others are SOBO.Sun came out about nine. Not really that warm yet, but looking better. Hiked over Marshall Peak. Still plenty of snow on the ground at this high elevation. After that it was Compton Mountain. Snow pretty much gone by this time. I met a group of eighth-graders from California who were climbing up as I was going down. They were on a field trip to the east. After that it was mostly down to the highway to Front Royal. Did not go into town or to the nearby hostel. I am shooting for two more days before needing to resupply.Feeling tired but decided to go on to this campsite. Made for a long afternoon.

A mile or so of field walking then back into the forest. Long steep climb up to ridge and start of rocky trail. This is what Pennsylvania is famous for on the trail. Stayed up on ridge most of time, then a beautiful view from Hawk Rock, looking down at Duncannon and Susquehanna River. Steep down to town. Quite a few day hikers in this area. Talked to Amy and Chris on the way down. They are from 40 miles away but Chris grew up here. He has had a recent hip replacement. Hiking up trail, so I would say it is working. They ended up picking me up just up from trail head and taking me to grocery store and then back to trail in downtown area. Great couple and very nice to do this favor. I went into famous Doyle hotel and had lunch. Good soup and burger. They had rooms but after getting key to check out, opted to not stay. Called another place and they picked me up hour later after I made a couple other stops nearby. O Positive came into Doyle. He was planning to zero there. Two nights? Also, The Family rolled into town just as I was leaving. They planning on hiking out to next shelter.I had planned the same, but just plain tired today. 22 days of hiking. Need a rest and a room by myself. Got to motel about 4 and have been taking it easy. Needed this I think.Will hike out tomorrow for 5 more days to end at Port Clinton. Talked to Beau about working out arrangements to meet him there and worked on my flight home. Originally, I had aspirations of taking the train back to Chicago, but that idea has faded. Too long of a trip.","Darlington Shelter

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587783,"Got ride back to Duncannon right on time. Hiked thru rest of town then across busy Susquehanna River bridge. Wide river. Did not know it was so large. After two miles finally back in forest and climbing out of valley. Two plus mile up and among rocky spine of ridge to first shelter. Fun hiking on the rock slabs at very top of ridge.Got to shelter and found The Family still there. I got water and talked to them for almost an hour. They were slow getting out this morning. Getting enough water here for rest of day and camp tonight. Only other option is at the next shelter but  it is way off trail and guide says down a very steep trail. I’d rather carry it now than do that. But with four days food and this water the pack is heavy.At lunch stop, 3 guys day hiking, passed me going south. Later, as I was leaving they were coming back, but one was vomiting. I decided to hike ahead.Here by myself tonight. Leapfrogged with Family several times. They passed my camp as I was setting up. They are planning to camp at road a mile north. I had enough of roads today. Will see them tomorrow.Talked to Beau last night. Think he will be picking me up Friday night and bought ticket home for Sunday evening.  Down to last few days.","Duncannon, PA

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587907,"Cool and windy. Really slept good. Made breakfast in tent which I usually do anyway but closed it back up as soon as stove done. Good Tastykake blueberry pie to eat. Local favorite I’m sure. Yum. Sun up. Hope it warms up quick.Hiked down to road crossing. The Family camped here. Did not see them back in the woods. The rest of the day was flat and I would say boring as the AT goes. Best thing was the rock bridges. Several of them. Lots of work to build I am sure. Rain is coming, so stoppped at shelter early. Got a fire going and set up inside. The Family came in and then about 5 nobo thru hikers. A couple in shelter but others had to tent. They are all hard core high milers. Probably be hiking in rain tomorrow. Going to another shelter. Hopefully tapers off by later as predicted.","Ridge top campsite. Mile 1163

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588016,"Rained overnight and more this morning. The nobo thru hikers up and gone early. They are really pushing fast. The Family and I hung around and talked waiting for rain to let up. Had a second cup of coffee even. I finally got going about 10:30 after saying good bye to them. They are going to hotel tonight and zero tomorrow so will not see again.  Great bunch. Was nice to get to know them the last 3 days. Pappy John, Dima, Vladik and Michael.Still raining a couple hours later but quit after that. Just damp and foggy. Hiked a few miles and crossed an interstate and then up a long climb to ridge top. Stayed on top rest of day. Some bad rocks at times. Hurting my feet again. Big shelter tonight with just 2 here. Has a 2nd floor via a ladder. Tang is other Hiker. We both think may have met last year. She is doing same as me. Completely what missed last year.","Rausch Shelter

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588111,"Nice night in shelter. Not quite as cold. Used up last of my gas this morning for coffee. Perfect. Sun bright and trail mostly dry. Tang staying late in shelter, but awake when I left.First few miles flew by on smooth trail. Got to a highway and then rocks started. Slow going. Stopped a couple times as normal. Second time a guy named Dan was there. Talked quite a while. He was doing trial hike prior to doing Long Trail in Vermont. Then more rocks and a really long wet stretch. It was fairly level and lots of pooling. Walked around a lot of it but still had wet feet. Made it to highway and called hostel for pickup.Craig picked me up and a couple miles to the place. Great place w lots of neat features such as outdoor shower with plenty of hot water, a privy built with old doors and outdoor sink. The bunk house has what is needed and only 6 bunks so crowd control. And there is a vintage trailer for rent too. Already suggested to Amy that this could be a Hostel she would be up for. Especially the trailer. Supper on the main house front porch. Good food and dessert. Dory and John are other guests. John is supporting Dory hiking. In true Hiker fashion, I ate some of what Dory could not eat of her meal. Can’t wait for breakfast.","William Penn Shelter

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588244,"Rained overnight Dory and John were really quiet and I slept till 7:00 when breakfast came. Wow what a nice service. As anticipated great breakfast with juice, coffee, fruit, egg bacon sandwich. I put my word in to shuttle back to trail at 8:45. Got rid of empty fuel canister, trash and whatever else could go. Lighten up load for last day.Not raining when started but after a short while started up again. Rained steady for couple hours. Not hard. Used umbrella and stayed dry as can be expected. Needed a break so went 0.3 off trail to shelter and out of rain. Hate to go off that far but did not want to just stop in the rain.Rain let up after going again. Now rocks to contend with which slows you down. Only hikers I saw today were probably monks.  Dressed that way at least. And finally the long steep descent to Port Clinton! Walked thru Reading and Northern rail yard and into town. Went to barber shop and had coffee and donut. Barbers welcome hikers. Lots of antiques and memorabilia. Steady flow of customers. When a lull, I asked and received a haircut and shave.Left there and hiked the half mile to Blue Mtn Road which was the actual place I started from when returning to trail last July. Changed my clothes under a bridge and went back to Port Clinton to hotel and restaurant. Had a nice long supper of cheese steak and fries. Beau got there about eight as planned and we drove back to his house in Conshohocken. Visited with wife Polly and family. Shower and bed. Long day and now the hiking is complete.","Rock 'n Sole Hostel

Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588324,"Had a fine day with Harringtons.  Great breakfast of pancakes and bacon.  Then did a few things with Beau around house and neighborhood.  Took Robert to karate.  Big event of day was trip to Simeone Auto Museum.  Excellent collection of racing cars from early 1900's and later.  They were even running a few in the big parking lot in back of building.
Great supper of beef stew and salad.  Just what I needed with fresh greens and comfort food.  Feet and knees feeling as expected.  Sore but not too bad.  Getting workout here because the room I'm in (Mary's) is on the 3rd floor.  Next day Beau and I took a drive around the area.  Looks of old mansions and other neighborhood visits in Philadelphia and nearby suburbs.  I like this area because of rolling hills and curvy streets in many areas.  Many more geographic features than I'm used to in the flat lands of Illinois.  We all went out for pizza.  Each of us ordered individual pizzas.  Kids liked that.  Good pizza too.  Then time to get packed up, say goodbyes and head to airport.  Beau dropped me off for 5:30 flight.  Amy picked me up at O'hare and home by 9:00.  Good to be back.",,"Conshohocken, PA","Apr 28, Sat",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591258,"Talked to John H over weekend, so went to help he and Kurt Monday morning.  The weather has been so poor the whole month of April in most of the eastern US.  But it changed a few days ago and planting is on in full force.  John got me acclimated to pulling the 50' field cultivator and worked the rest of the day in a couple fields.  Glad to jump right into this.  No time to fall in to a rut of missing the trail etc.   Three days doing this was really good and was ready for a rest day after that.  They finished the corn planting and so I was pretty much done too.",,"Sandwich, IL ","Apr 30, Mon",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591259,"The last 400 miles for me was really good overall.  How could it be otherwise, I was back on the trail and going to complete 'every' mile of the AT.  With Amy slack packing me the first week, it got off to a great start.  Was able to do fairly high miles at the beginning without over doing it.  Mainly due to carrying light pack and having the luxury of dropoff and  pickup each day.  Good food and bed too.  Amy really had a good time this week too.  Lots of history and other sights to see in the area.  She also looked up Kaitlin who lives in the area and is a top Harley Davidson salesperson at Old Dominion HD in Charlottesville.
A one month duration hike is also a really good fit.  Felt like I was doing a long distance hike and was in the groove of daily hiking.  Had some good stops at hostels, normal resupply sources and intervals, etc.  I hiked at pretty much the same pace as 2017.  Averaged 15 miles per day.  Did not take any zero days.  Was motivated to get through by end of month.  Had one day when I felt that I was really tired and needed a break.  That was when I hit Duncannon.  Turned it into a nero and got a motel room.  
Only thing missing was some long duration hiking with new friends.  Met lots of thru hikers, but most were either going SOBO or pace was slower than mine.  Most I met were flip floppers starting out in the last week or so.  Makes sense that they would be going slower at this time in hike.  I did spend 3 days/nights seeing the Warner Family (dad and 3 teenage sons) near the end.  They had started north on flip flop a week south of Harpers Ferry.  Still keeping up with them as they hike north.  Many other interesting people along the way.  Usually got to know them in a single night together at shelter, etc.  Just not able to stay with them for various reasons.  
The other big factor was weather.  It was much colder than normal and also pretty wet.  Not sure it was really wetter than normal.  I survived the weather just fine, although the cold was challenging.  Spent a few nights on the edge of being cold, but never was miserable.  Hiked most days with rain pants on for an extra layer and a mid layer over base shirt.  Was hoping for a day where I could hike out of camp with shorts and t-shirt.  I think that did happen, but maybe only one or two times.  There was snow several days, but never more than an inch on the ground.  I stayed inside shelters much more often.  That was mainly for weather, but also due to fact there were not many people staying in the shelters.  Sometimes just me.",,Observations,"May 05, Sat",0
Bluestem,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591262,"I did nothing major regarding gear compared to my 2017 hike.  But there were several things of note.  Most are additions which did not help my weight, but ended up being decent choices.  
Sleep system.  Used my 15 degree down bag.  15 degree means survival.  Comfort level is about 25 or 30.  I purchased a silk bag liner.  Had wanted one of these before for help with being too hot.  This time it helped as extra warmth.  Took a little getting used to, but I'll be using it for most hiking trips in the future.  Since I knew it was going to be cold, I got a foil backed foam windshield sun shade and cut it to about 3 feet long.  That was to provide extra under side insulation and reflect back my body heat.  Can't really prove it worked, but never felt like I was cold from below.  Finally, I made an air mattress inflator that worked well.  Garbage bag with small hole and rubber banded to a short hose that fit over my mattress nozzle.  If I got a full bag of air (open end into wind), then I could fill the mattress full in single cycle.  Love not having that task of about 20 big breaths to fill it up.  Minimal weight for all three of these items.  
I bought a good hiking umbrella and used it quite a bit.  And it did really work.  Kept me dry from belt up (except forearms holding poles).  I got my system down for attaching it to pack so could be hands free.  Attachment method was about 90%, but the best I could do.  Main issues were wishing it was a little higher in front (vision uphill) and then if it was windy who knew what would happen.  One day in hard rain from my left, I just held umbrella with one hand in the right direction.  Not hands free, but dry.  The durability of the umbrella was great.  No turning inside out or damage from branches, tree trunks, etc.  
No specific clothing changes.  Just wore more layers on a regular basis.  Took a folding stand for canister stove along, but did not use.  Left it in a hiker box.  Ate most of the same foods.  Wanted to try some leaf spinach to see if it would last but never had opportunity.",,View Entry,"May 06, Sun",0
