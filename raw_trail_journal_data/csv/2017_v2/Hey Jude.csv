Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552350,"March 26, 2017. This is the date I've been preparing for the last 17 months; the start of hiking the Appalachian Trail. After months of research, reading equipment reviews, comparison shopping, purchasing of items needed, and finally experimenting with various boots, backpacks and trail foods, I feel like a hiking expert without having stepped foot on the AT. I've day hiked for many years, and motorcycle camped for just as long, so this is not a new experience for me. What will be new is the day to day challenge of hiking the rocky terrain, maneuvering different elevations, varying and extreme weather conditions and 2,190 miles to final destination. This is an adventure of a life time and worth all the effort in its preparation.In October of 2015, my best friend Cheryl Cowan and I were drinking some wine contemplating what we'd like to do once we both were retired. Since we both liked to hike, and drink wine, the dream of hiking the AT was born. LOL. We have spent many hours planning this trip via phone calls, visits, texting and emails with Cheryl in VA and I in Ohio. Camping and equipment shakedowns have taken place to see what needs tweaking, along with daily hiking miles calculated, food stops and available water sources. Our backpacks are at a weight we can handle with full supplies, and know with each meal it will lighten the load some. It hasn't been easy deciding if you really need that extra pair of pants or shirt versus extra food or water. It will all work out. We need some surprises along the trail. The time thru-hiking the trail is between 6-7 months. We will start at Springer Mountain, GA, and end on the mountain top of Katadin in Maine. We will travel thru 14 states. The trails are marked with white blazes on trees, rocks or posts to keep us on the right path. Some trails are marked with blue blazes, little bit easier trail or these trails leading to the AT from roadways. In the New England states, cairns are used as markers instead of blazes. We plan leaving the trail to go into towns for food re-supply about every 4-5 days. We will carry 5 dinners, 5 lunches, 5 breakfasts along with snacks, and 4-6 lbs of water. This is half of our backpack weight filled. Our water sources where we will have to filter our water should be available almost daily around the shelter areas. At least that is what the AT Guide Book is telling us. With the wildfires in GA, 71.2 miles of the AT were burned; the eastern end of the Smoky Mountains. That area is closed at this time. Maybe by the time we reach this area, trail maintenance will make it passable to hike on thru. We plan on getting a room in a hostel or motel every three weeks for a shower and laundry. All other times we will be tenting. Some people think the most danger on the AT would be the black bears. Although they can be provoked, which I don't plan on doing, the tick is more of a threat. Cheryl found this nifty tick remover, which I'm sure we will get some use out of. LOL. We also will be spraying our clothing and equipment to help prevent the ticks from attaching. I covered a lot of information some of you may have wondered about. Please feel free to email me if you have questions. I'll be sending updates and photos as often as I can, but for now, I don't know how ""often"" really is. If you're in any of the areas that we will be hiking, please come hike with us.",,Appalachian Trail,"Dec 08, Thu",0
Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552373,"Gear Overload - My head is spinning!Most hikers that I know have had the same brain overload trying to select gear and equipment for the planned long haul hike. Reviews are actually very helpful, and steer you in the right direction. Some brands will be a perfect fit, while others are not. Trialing your gear and equipment is essential before hitting the mother trail. I've had a few shakedowns with my equipment and tweaks had to be made and some gear returned to find a better fit.Selecting a backpack is probably one of the most important purchases you will make besides hiking boots. My backpack had to fit like a comfortable bra, as I will be wearing it for many months. The first backpack was an Osprey and the fit was good, but while trialing, one of the straps ripped from the side seam. Back to REI to try on other brands, as I didn't feel confident going back to a product that could potentially rip again. Finally purchased a Gregory Jade 63. The fit was good and the harness didn't cut into my armpits. Yes, just like a comfortable bra.Tents, tents and more tents. Decided on a North Face Storm Trekker 1. Single person tent with enough room for me and my backpack. Can stretch and sit up and dress without hitting the top of tent. Little vestibule for muddy boots.Thermarest sleeping mat was by far the best choice for me. Since I'm a stomach sleeper, the thermarest has wider arm room at the top of mat and narrows down. Fits perfectly in my tent. Self inflating with a couple of blows.Sleeping bags galore! Articles on synthetic vs down, numerous. Purchased a North Face 600 Down fill bag good to 10 degrees. I've used it motorcycle camping for the last few months and it sure keeps you warm. Most times I'm unzipping to cool off. Will be good in the mountains when the temperatures are much cooler. I can also turn around inside the bag without getting tangled. Trekking Poles. Again, there are many to choose from. I purchased the Black Diamond with the clips to adjust. Soft sponge grips do make your hands a little sweaty, but no soreness noted after several hours of use in a day hike. Wasn't sure I wanted poles at first, but now I wouldn't hike without them.",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Fri",0
Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552379,"As I mentioned before, my backpack and hiking boots are the most important gear for any type hiking. Hiking boots vary from thick sole to thin, high tops to ankle height, waterproof to insulated. So many boots to choose from, and I tried on dozens. Before I made any hiking boot purchases, I checked the return policy. It's kind of hard to only wear boots in the house to see if they are a good fit or not. Some stores will not let you return if worn outside unless they are defective. So I purchased several pairs of hikers over several months and returned most of them. While testing them out on some local and AT trails, some rubbed my skin raw, caused blisters, or the soles of my feet were sore for days after the hike. I always purchase a 1/2 size larger to accommodate my heavier socks, and room for my toes when going downhill. I don't plan on losing any toenails on my AT travels. This worked well with the fit also. I do have three pairs of hikers and will wear them on different sections on the trail. I've been told that when you hit Pennsylvania, due to the rocky terrain, hiking boots go there to die. 
My Ahnu hiking boots are the most comfortable boots ever. Only problem is the soles are not thick enough and stones and tree branches are felt when stepping on. I will have these boots sent to me to wear somewhere on the trail where it's more flat. Replacing the insoles have helped some, but the soles are still not as thick as i would prefer.
My Merrell hiking boots are also the most comfortable boots ever, but will never survive the trail. Called mid hikers, waterproof and breathable, they are not as sturdy. I've been told by many that the trail will rip them up. I'll have these boots sent to me also after the others wear out and before I have to purchase another pair. No hiking boots will go to waste on my feet. LOL. 
My Danner Mountain 600 4.5s will be my starters and the main hikers. They are sturdy, yet light weight, waterproof, thick soles, and the inserts are very cushy. I believe these will hold up very well. 
As far as clothing goes, I've learned whatever you wear, within 20 minutes of hiking you will be pealing off layers. So I just suck it up and save myself the trouble of taking off layers. Being cold makes you want to move a little faster. It works! really!
All the trail books I've read advise having camp clothes to change into after you get off the trail each day, separate sleeping clothes, and an extra change of clothes in case you get wet or muddy. After calculating all these items, my backpack weight was way over the preferred weight to carry. Separate sleeping clothes I agree with. Still wanting to have an extra set of clothing but not the added weight. Somehow I will make this work. 
That's all for now.",,View Entry,"Dec 10, Sat",0
Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555018,"Just wanted to introduce my AT trail sister Cheryl, trail name Silver Eagle. In a months time our journey will begin. Six months or 180 days, however we count down the days. Last minute preparations of food assortment, miscellaneous gear purchased, bounce boxes being put together, and still trialing socks. Breaking in another pair of Danner hiking boots for backup. Looking forward to blogging once we get on the trail to share our journey.","

Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556888,"One week from today my trail sister Silver Eagle and I will be on the AT to start a journey we've planned for many, many months. When my trail sister came to Ohio from VA last week to pick me up and visit her family, we had a slight setback when I came down with bronchitis and she the flu. I haven't felt this sick in years. Today seems to be a turning point for us both, so now we need to start slowly regaining our strength. sheeeeezzzzz. Never saw this coming, but so thankful we were local to seek medical and in familiar surroundings. We'll be heading down south in a few days to hitch our ride to GA. So excited.

Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557783,"Day 1 of AT Hike. End hike. Just kidding. LOL. Hiked six miles, got a late start. Was a very long day which started in SC and a three hour drive to Springer MTN. Rained most of day, hiked in a lot of mud. Never made it to first shelter, very exhausted. Seems we packed way too much food, as did everyone we talked to. Met some very nice hikers who blew by us. Nice to be young again. We camped last night in an open area off the trail. Had some difficulty hanging our bear bag with food and items that had odors. Gave up and put in the y of a tree. Was there this morning so we weren't visited by bears last night. Good thing.We hiked two miles this morning in the mud and rain. We are done for the day as storms are coming in and we needed water and some good meals. Kind of like a half zero day. Tomorrow we hit the trails early rain or shine to hike to our next shelter seven miles away. Was not an option for today.","Springer Mountain

Stayed on Blood Mountain last night in a cabin. Storms were brutal so glad we were inside. Sun shining. Waiting on Cheryl to get things mailed home.
With water and food added today my pack is at 27.6. After lunch and dinner and drinking water as we go, pack weight will go down. Having a fun time but the elevations are brutal.","Neel Gap

Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558656,"Camped on Hog Pen Gap last night with about 15 other campers. Had trail magic earlier that was such a surprise. Fresh fruit, cookies and water. At the Gap last night the winds were relentless and temps in the thirties. Then car and motorcycle races that went on for hours. No sleep night. LOL. Today April 1st, we hiked 4.4 miles until a pinky toe blister decided to end our hike. Feel bad as we had plans to hike another 5 miles today to get to Blue Mountain Shelter. In Low Gap shelter tonight with many camping on the perimeter. Great jet boil meal, no tent set up, and level shelter. Hope to get out on the trail early in the morning. We've a 5 mile incline before leveling off. Keeping fingers crossed blister behaves tomorrow. Still meeting such wonderful hikers along the way. Realized today that this journey would be much easier if I had hooves. Nothing but rock, roots and mud. LOL. Son Kris is still trying to figure out why we can't log into Trailjournals. So in the mean time, thanks Kris keeping everyone updated on our travels. Until next area with wifi service, we'll journal again on our travels.","Neel Gap

We hiked 9 miles today, the first 5-6 going to top of Blue Mtn. It was pretty intense and glad to be going to bed soon. Caught shuttle for Hiawassee Budget Inn as severe storms are headed our way. No rooms for us tonight so we are camping on there grass. We do have a room tomorrow where we can shower, do laundry and relax. Blister on little toe did not pop on today's hike so had to pin stick. Putting second skin on for next few days. Son is sending food box and another pair of my hikers which should arrive on Tuesday. We'll hit the trail once I get our stash and send other hikers back. One thing both Cheryl and I have noticed is AT miles are totally different then country and city miles. Having fun and my legs are not burning so much. Thank you all for following. Hey Jude","Low Gap

Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558853,"What the heck! It's day 11 and we aren't even out of Georgia! Between backpack and blister issue and dealing with severe weather, we can't get our momentum going. Wanted to start up Tray Mtn yesterday after my boots arrived via Fed Ex, but they didn't come in time and we wouldn't have made it to the shelter. Today is severe weather zero day. We will head out tomorrow at 6:30am for a shuttle back to the trail for our hike up Tray. We hear it's pretty challenging, so early start may get us into the shelter for night. Snow expected next two nights. Silver Eagle, my trail sister has a zero degree sleeping bag, mine 15 degree. Will be wearing a few layers to bed. One of our dear hiker friends is off the trail and heading home. She hiked in the rains the other day, couldn't get warm and has multiple blisters on both feet. We will miss you Trooper. I pray that my blister(s) is not what takes me off the trail. We have enough food for 5-7 days, collecting water at shelter stops to filter as we go. We won't be in a town again until Resupply.

Hey Jude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559437,"3 Days entry - Holiday Inn was nice during the storm but time to move on. Our shuttle driver was late so we didn't hit the trail to Tray Mountain until 8am. What a climb. 5.7 miles and almost all were straight up to 4,400 feet. We seem to be doing a mile an hour going up steep elevations. We had rain, sleet and snow which stayed all night. Plus the winds were brutal. Cold sleeping in Shelter and hearing the winds. We were so cold we got in our sleeping bags at 6:30pm just to try and warm up along with all the others. Don't ever want to be that cold again.Woke up this morning to snow on the ground and tents. Didn't sleep much with the winds howling all night. Didn't even eat breakfast as it was so cold. Took off for Dicks Creek Shelter 11 miles away but with the inclines on Kelleys Knob, we stopped at Deep Gap almost 8 miles along. This Shelter has two floors so we will be packed tonight. The climbs and descends were pretty hard on us today, mostly because we didn't eat and we're still cold. And we ran out of water. Enough places to get, but filtering it takes time. Tomorrow we hope to have an eight mile day and the next into NC. Georgia is kicking our butts. LOLSorry for delayed journal entries. Either I'm tired from hiking, hungry, cold or no service. LOL. Mostly no service. Woke up today to low 30s and very cold. Need a sleeping liner as the bag is not keeping me warm. Also woke up to boots with acorns in them. My boots were on a shelf above my head, so surprised none fell on me. We did here them scurrying all night. Today was a killer day. Hiked from Deep Ridge Gap to Dicks Creek, then challenged the 1,000 foot hike and then some to Plumorchard Shelter 8.1 miles all up hill. LOL. As I said it was a rough climb for me.

We also hit the 100 mile mark on the trail from Springer. Pics will be coming but website still give us difficulties. It was a long day and we were pretty tired once we reached the shelter. Many streams for water to filter. Amazed at the forests of rhododendrons. The hiker grapevine is amazing. Everyone was talking about a forest fire at Winding Stair Gap.

Almost at our destination we came to an area on the trail called Jump Off. The views were spectacular and panoramic. I assume this is where people decide to take the final plunge. Trying to get down from the huge boulders to continue on the trail was not pleasant. My foot got stuck between two boulders and wedged me in. By the time I could free my foot, I slid down the boulders onto the trail. My foot was hurting but we still had three miles to hike before the shelter, and the thunder storms were fast approaching.
