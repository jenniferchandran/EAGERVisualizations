Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556794,"Don’t read if you’re hoping to follow a thru-hiker! Trail name of Decade means I honestly think it’s going to take a decade to complete the trail. Realized last year that if I waited till I could take 5 months away from work or home, I might never get started. Piece by piece I’m moving forward, one small section at a time. I’m pulling my 2016 NOBO miles from Springer into my 2017 mile-count. Not trying to misrepresent what I’ve done this year, just trying to keep the cumulative miles straight in my head. Hope that is OK.Chose the week of March 11-17 because our youngest son would be on spring break from college. Last year, he and friends went to Panama City for spring break, tenting at a campground near the beach—a choice I wasn’t so sure about. This year it wasn’t clear if he’d be free, as he was on the bubble for a wild card bid to the NCAA wrestling tourney. But if a bid didn’t come through, he said, “For spring break, could I go hiking with you on the Appalachian Trail?” YES. YES. YES. YES. YES.   A few days ago, we learned he fell just short of a bid—disappointing to him, but now making possible a section hike with me.   I’ll pick him up at the Atlanta airport on Monday night, March 13, and we’ll hike till the 17th. I’ll hike Sunday and Monday on my own, before leaving the trail to pick him up Monday night. Have been watching the weather, and it looks like it will be very cold—the teens or lower a couple of nights. We just don’t have flexibility to change our dates. Our gear includes a 0-degree quilt for me and a 10-degree bag for him, so we think we’ll survive even though it won’t be the weather we'd hoped. Made reservations at Top of Georgia hostel for Wednesday night, which is forecast to be the coldest night this week.I drove down to Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega today. Wanted to leave home early in the morning, getting to the hostel by late afternoon. But I stayed at work till 3 a.m. last night, clearing everything off my desk that might possibly have been requested this week. Slept at home till late morning, didn’t leave the house till afternoon. Got to Hiker Hostel just before 10 p.m. Looked as though 90% of guests were asleep. They showed me to an empty top bunk in a dark room with 3 other sleeping people. As quietly as I could, I prepared the sheets and climbed up to sleep. Losing an hour’s sleep due to the Spring Forward time change.","Home

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556798,"Breakfast this morning with other hikers at Hiker Hostel.   Humbling to sit next to a young lady who the day before had RUN from Springer Mountain to Neels Gap in 8-something hours. I had to make sure I’d heard her correctly—I had!   Met a man who said he’d probably be at Top of Georgia Wednesday night when my son and I stay there.   Met a few other people, I believe starting at Springer. I’d hiked Springer to Neels Gap last fall, and wanted to start at Neels Gap and reach Unicoi Gap before I left the trail to pick up Ben at the Atlanta airport Monday night. Transportation fell into place when I learned a group was arranging a shuttle to Unicoi Gap. I could follow the shuttle driver with my car, park my car at Unicoi, then ride with the driver back to Neels Gap.Arrived back at Mountain Crossings a little after 10 a.m. Bought a 16-oz Nalgene, thinking I’d try the trick where you place a Nalgene bottle full of boiling water in the foot of your sleeping bag at night. Was trying to keep my pack as light as possible, so this and 3 extra tent stakes were the only duplicates I carried.   Not sure why I grabbed the extra tent stakes before I left home.Set off at 10:30 a.m. Expected to see a bubble of hikers. While there were several hikers milling around Mountain Crossings, I saw very few on the trail. It was snowy and silent. No bird calls, no squirrels, nothing. Maybe once I heard a woodpecker in the distance.   Made me think of the Robert Frost line, “The woods are lovely, dark and deep.” Later that afternoon, when I was about a mile from Low Gap Shelter, I stepped aside for three young men to pass. When I got to Low Gap, they were setting up their tents. More hikers had tents set up closer to the shelter, and others were in the shelter. I asked the guys if I could tent with them, and was relieved when they said “sure!” Two had been friends since high school. The third had met the first two near Amicalola Falls and they’d formed a team. One said to me, “You don’t have any extra tent stakes, do you? I left mine at Mountain Crossings.” He was thrilled that I had 3 to lend.   I boiled water and ate the chili I’d made a month ago and dehydrated at home.   It tasted great—one of those recipes designed to copy Wendy’s chili. Shared 1/3 with one of the young men, who seemed pleased to have hot food. A little later, one of the guys shouted to me, “You don’t care if we fart do you?” I told him I’d grown up with three brothers and had raised two sons—no problem. As I lay in my tent, they proceeded to have a farting contest at least as active as the Blazing Saddles campfire scene. I fell asleep before it was over.","Mountain Crossings

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556804,"I believe it got down to the mid-20’s last night. Stayed warm in my quilt. I’d modified the quilt before I left home in case it was too drafty as I roll over at night in the bitter cold. It is an Enlightened Equipment 0-degree quilt. In the gaps between the provided quilt straps, I sewed six small elastic loops on the quilt, three on each side, opposite each other. Then I cut three narrow elastic straps to stretch around the sleeping pad, that can be scooted and lined up with the new loops on the quilt.   Before knotting the elastic pad straps, I threaded two large toggle-type buttons through each of the elastic straps. I pushed the buttons on the straps close to the middle of my pad. When I arrange the quilt at night, I attach the quilt to the EE straps as well as to the three toggle buttons on the straps that I added. This cinches the quilt to the pad in three additional places.Had two packets of hot oatmeal and a cup of coffee for breakfast, and started hiking 9.7 miles to Unicoi Gap, where my car was parked. The three young men from the tent site passed me within the hour, headed to Unicoi Gap to hitch a ride to a motel in Hiawassee. Never saw them again. I hiked steadily, as I needed to pick up my son Ben from the Atlanta airport around 9:30 tonight. We had reservations at Blood Mountain Cabins, and I wanted to check in and shower before leaving for the airport. It was colder and windy today, a little icy in places. Wore my gloves, hat and buff most of the day. About 1 mile from Unicoi Gap I congratulated myself for not falling yet.   About 0.6 mile from Unicoi Gap I didn’t see that the trail curved around, not over, a big flat rock. Not sure what I did wrong—I think it had something do with ice on the rock and mud on my shoes—but next thing I knew I was tumbling over the rock and landing awkwardly on my right knee and right hand. A lady saw me fall, and asked if I was OK. I was too embarrassed to tell her I wasn’t. My right knee hurt quite a bit and inside my glove I could tell that my right pinky finger was swelling and would not bend.Got to my car, took naproxen, and inspected things. Decided the knee pain was just a bruise. Took off my gloves and looked at the pinky finger and first thought it had to be broken. It was disfigured and would not bend. Put my Nalgene with icy cold water in my cup holder and started icing my finger as I pulled out of Unicoi. Found the Hiawassee ER on my GPS and thought I might head there. My other thought was to go to a drugstore for a metal finger splint, and deal with the finger when I got home. Felt the 3 bones in my pinky as I was driving. Interestingly, they weren’t that sore. It was the closest knuckle that was disfigured and sore. Pulled out on the little finger, thinking perhaps it was only dislocated. Nothing improved. Pulled the car over to the side of the road, shut my eyes, and then pulled slow and HARD on my little finger—and felt the joint latch into place. My finger was purple and swollen, but it had been dislocated, not broken, and would now bend again! Turned the car around and headed to Mountain Crossings, bought a frozen pizza for Ben, then checked into the Mountain Lion at Blood Mountain Cabins. I love, love, love the simplicity of that cabin. Took a picture and sent it to my husband: “This is how I want our house to be.”Drove through foggy, twisty Georgia roads to get to the Atlanta airport. Ben seemed to have recovered from the disappointment of not making the wrestling finals. He talked the whole way back to the cabin . . . about his classes, about his friends, about the hike. He baked and ate the hot pizza, then went to sleep in the loft and I went to sleep downstairs.","Low Gap Shelter
",Unicoi gap,"Mar 13, Mon",9.70
Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556819,"This is the day that hikers who have 5 months to complete the trail, not just a few days until they have to be back at school or work, smartly got off the trail, found warm hostels or motels, and zeroed . . . I’m sure wondering about those of us who were crazy enough to stay on the trail.I believe the weather app said Hiawassee was going to be in the mid-teens overnight. Up in the mountains, it could be another 10 degrees colder. Add some wind chill, and it could feel like zero or colder. And yes it did.Ben and I checked out of the lovely, warm Mountain Lion cabin and drove to Unicoi Gap, parking the car around 12:30 p.m. He had a good quality 10-degree sleeping bag and pad, and I had my 0-degree quilt and an X-Therm pad. We knew it would be cold, but we thought we’d make it. I wore two shirts under my down jacket and two pairs of leggings under my hiking pants, one Patagonia Capilene, one Smart Wool. Ben had two pairs of Polartec leggings under his pants, and two Polartec shirts under his down jacket. With all this, we were warm enough as long as we kept moving. We had hats that covered our ears and Turtle Fur buffs on our neck and lower face. I put my sleep socks over my gloves. I spent much of the day lowering my buff momentarily to unfog my glasses, then pulling it back up again.We felt it get steadily colder all day. When we got to Tray Mountain Shelter, our water bottles were half-way frozen. Papa Smurf and another hiker had tents set up in the shelter. They weren’t monopolizing, they truly hadn’t expected any more hikers to show up. They offered to make room for us, as it was quite windy away from the shelter, but I didn’t want to take any space away from someone who might show up later. Pitching a tent was a process, because we needed to take off our gloves to do the more intricate stuff, but we could only have our gloves off for 30-45 seconds at a time before our hands became nonfunctional in the cold. Ben got in his sleeping bag right away, around 6:30 p.m. I offered to make him some warm supper in the shelter, but soon realized my 3-season fuel wouldn’t work. Stuck it inside my jacket for about an hour while lying in my quilt and then tried again. Got a flame for 10 seconds and then it stopped. During that hour, the water in my cookpot had frozen. Gave Ben a Little Debbie Nutty Buddy and Fritos for supper. I had a Nutty Buddy, crawled in my quilt, and cinched it top and bottom so I was completely enclosed. Eventually felt warm, except for my feet, as I was keeping our icy water bottles and cold fuel at the bottom of my bag so we’d have water and fuel in the a.m.We tried toe warmers I’d brought, but weren’t impressed. Maybe we did something wrong. I am glad we didn’t set up inside the shelter. It wasn’t long before Moosekimo and Gator Dave showed up and needed the shelter. I’m not even sure they had tents. We all hunkered down for the night. I may never see them again, but I feel bonded for life with our overnight mates at the frigid Tray Mountain Shelter.","Unicoi gap
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Mar 14, Tue",5.70
Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556823,"Woke up to frigid weather.   We’d stayed warm enough, all but our toes. Toe warmers never got warm, and of course the partially frozen bottles of water we’d stored at the foot of our sleeping bags didn’t help. Without a way to boil water, I couldn’t do the trick with a warm Nalgene bottle in the bottom of the sleeping bags. We had to take our gloves off to get our tents completely packed up, but the process was slow as our fingers wouldn’t work if exposed more than 30-45 seconds. Went to the shelter and tried to use the 3-season fuel I’d warmed in my sleeping bag all night, but it still wouldn’t light. So … no supper, no breakfast. Gave Ben a Little Debbie Nutty Buddy bar and package of Pop Tarts to last the day. I had a Nutty Buddy, and decided to hold on eating it. I put it in my pocket so I wouldn’t have to take off my pack to get it mid-day.
Papa Smurf, Moosekimo, Gator Dave and the other hiker said they were cold overnight. I think they had 20-degree bags or quilts and it just wasn’t enough. Everyone was ready to get moving and warm up.Again we both had two pairs of leggings under our pants, and two shirts under our jackets. We wore hats and buffs and gloves, and I wore my sleep socks over my gloves. I realized that despite the weight, in the future I will carry a Spot or Delorme device.   It would be too easy to fall, break a leg, and die of exposure before another hiker came along … especially if you’re a slower hiker like me who might be bringing up the rear at the end of the day.The scenery was beautiful, but all day I thought about the Top of Georgia Hostel. It would be warm and there would be pizza! At noon I reached in my pocket for the Little Debbie bar that I’d saved, and it was gone. It dropped out of my pocket, somewhere on the trail.   I thought about how happy it would make the hiker who found it, especially if they were as hungry as I was.With one mile left of the 11-mile hike, I sent Ben ahead to Dick’s Creek Gap, just in case the Top of Georgia shuttle happened to be there. I can’t tell you the joy I felt when I got to the parking lot 10 minutes after Ben, and there was the shuttle, warm and waiting. Had hot chocolate within a few minutes of arriving. Ben said, “Mom, I think I could eat two pizzas,” and he did—even though we burned the crust.  Went to bed at 7:30 p.m. in a 4-bunk room, was asleep before 8 p.m., warm, cozy and full.","
",Dick's Creek Gap,"Mar 15, Wed",11
Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556827,"Slept very well at Top of Georgia. Fell asleep shortly after 7:30 p.m., woke up at 7:15 a.m. We had showers, they did our laundry, and after coffee and cereal Thursday morning, we felt good as new. The temperature was warming up. We were energized again.I took their 8 a.m. shuttle to Unicoi Gap and brought my car back to the hostel, picked up Ben, and then parked at Dick’s Creek Gap. We would have loved to have hiked north till the end of the day, but we couldn’t figure out a way to do it and still get Ben to the airport on Friday. If we’d kept going north, there was no way to be shuttled back to my car at Dick’s Creek Gap. With the road still closed at Deep Gap, the next “shuttle-able” crossing would be at mile 105.9, Rock Gap, too much for us to do in a day.
So, we did what hikers hate to do . . . back track. We hiked 4.5 miles to Plumorchard Gap Shelter and stopped for lunch. It felt like spring. Maybe an occasional cold burst of wind, but altogether a different world than the two previous days. Plumorchard Gap Shelter is nice. There are three levels you can sleep on, and the top level is completely shielded from wind. Three or four men were there, just hanging out. It was a small world. One man, from Maine, mentioned he’d gone to Purdue, which is where I went. We talked about the student apartments there. Another man mentioned that he met a hiker who said he’d been happy to find a Little Debbie Nutty Buddy bar on the trail—which had to have been the one I lost the day before!
Ben and I hiked 4.1 miles back to a campsite 0.4 miles from Dick’s Creek Gap. There are actually two campsites there, one closer to the trail, where a couple had already set up, and one a little further back. We went further back. No one else showed up. The couple had a sweet dog, Spirit, who came back to visit us a few times. And when Ben had difficulty starting a campfire, the couple came back and shared their experience with him.
My fuel/stove was working again, so we had a good meal. I boiled water to try the Nalgene bottle trick to warm up the sleeping bags. We went to sleep knowing we wouldn’t be cold overnight. It was a great ending to the week.","Dick's Creek Gap
",Plumorchard Gap Shelter,"Mar 16, Thu",4.50
Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556832,"Woke up at 7 a.m., Ben set his phone alarm. I believe the temperature was in the low 20’s, but we were never cold overnight. Packed up fairly quickly—it’s amazing what you can do when your fingers work!   Hiked the 0.4 mile to the car at Dick’s Creek Gap. Stopped by Top of Georgia for Ben to look for his hiking pillow—found it wedged between the bunk and the wall where he’d slept Wednesday night.While getting a cup of coffee at TOG, spoke with a lady who said her hiking partner had broken her leg while hiking Wednesday or Thursday, one of the two coldest days, and was seriously ill from exposure while waiting the 2+ hours for EMTs to get to her on the mountain. She could be warmed by a sleeping bag, but not completely. Fortunately, they had phone service to call 911. Convinced me again that a Spot or Delorme might be in my future.
Got Ben to the Atlanta airport a couple hours before his flight. He said he had a great spring break. I was so pleased he felt that way.
On my drive home, I thought about quilt issues. My quilt kept me warm on the severely cold night, but it took some work to do so. Before leaving for the AT, I had sewn 3 extra loops on each side, to provide 3 more attachments to the pad (see March 13 entry). So when I set up my quilt and pad on the coldest of nights, I had 10 attachments, 5 on each side. My fingers were so cold it was a little hard to make the connections. It kept me warm, but even with all the attachments I had to check several times when I rolled over to make sure I hadn’t shifted the quilt and created a draft. On the other hand, Ben simply climbed into his 10 degree bag, zipped it up, and cinched his hood and draft collar. He could roll around at will without worrying about a draft. On a bitterly cold night, I believe you have more freedom of movement in a zippered bag. However, at Top of Georgia, where we used our sleeping gear for covers in the indoor bunks, I could easily open my quilt and adjust my temperature. Bottom line, I think quilts are great for moderate to warm temperatures, but for extremely cold nights I believe I’d sleep better in a bag—less work to set up, and less attention required to positioning when rolling over.
If all goes as planned, I’ll be attending an end-of-week conference in Tennessee in April, a 3-hr drive from Dick’s Creek Gap. Hoping that either before or after the conference I can hike from Dick’s Creek to somewhere near Franklin, and then make more northbound progress over 4-5-day weekends this summer. My two daughters say they’ll join me at some point, and I bet I’ll get one of my boys on the trail again, too. Hoping I can make connections with my Trail Journals friends, too.
Best wishes to all of you.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561245,"Leaving home early tomorrow morning, heading back to the trail for 4-5 days, before going to a conference in Tennessee at the end of the week. Hope to start hiking by early afternoon. Will come back for a few days in May to pick up at where I end this trip. And hopefully continue to come back every 4-6 weeks until the end of October. A crazy way to do the AT. Never get my trail legs, because I'm never on the trail long enough. 
Don't know how to express how left-out it feels to be section hiking, when my brain wants to through-hike. Not ready to retire yet. Section-hiking for now, and glad I have the health and good fortune to do so. There are people my age who can only dream of hiking: dealing with bone-on-bone knees, undergoing chemotherapy, caring for frail family members, spending their retirement unexpectedly raising grandchildren who desperately need stability in their lives . . . I need to remember that I won the lottery just to be here, even if it's only section by section. And despite how high and how far I go in a day, there are a bazillion people doing far tougher things than me.
Planning to start tomorrow where I left off last month, and walk north as far as I can till Thursday afternoon. Got as far as Plumorchard Shelter in March before backtracking to my car at Dicks Creek Gap, so for mileage purposes, Plumorchard is the official starting point. This will be the third time I've hiked those 4.5 miles between Dicks Creek Gap and Plumorchard Shelter.
I'm not the fastest walker, am used to being passed. But miles hiked is the product of rate x hours. Rate might be slow, but hoping I can hike longer hours and get the job done.
Just read Mrs. Knobby's update. Wondering if I hike some long days whether I can catch up with her and say Hi. Have been doing a mental calculus to figure it out. If I do some long days and she's doing laundry and re-supplying, maybe's there's a chance I'll catch her at the NOC on Thursday.
Backpack is packed and ready to go. Have one more thing to do tonight before I leave: go out to the garage and give all my hiking clothes a good dose of permethrin spray.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562316,"Quite behind on updating the journal!  Couldn't do it from the trail as I either had poor service or had minimal battery reserve (accidentally forgot to put my phone on airplane mode one day).  In the mountains, there's a vortex whirling your charge away right before your eyes--always remember airplane mode!  Ran into the web design changeover when I tried to update yesterday.  Finally catching up.
Long-awaited trip.  Dealt with rain and cool weather on the 8-hr drive on Sunday, April 23, to Joyce and Sally's home, shuttle drivers outside of Hiawassee who allowed me to park my car at their home and then shuttled me to Dick's Creek Gap.  Put on my new poncho and headed out.  Kept thinking the drizzle would stop, but never did.  The poncho is the Zpacks poncho.  Didn't find it restrictive, didn't feel it caused me to overheat.  Definitely not a fashion statement, but it kept the pack dry.  It only goes to my lower thigh, so pant legs, socks and shoes were wet.  
Expected to see more people.  I think I was passed by only 3 hikers.  Presume that thru-hikers took advantage of the rainy day to get off the trail and do laundry and resupply.
Thought I'd stay at a site where the Guthook app showed a tent symbol at 0.7 mile after Plumorchard.  Never saw it, and I was looking hard for it.  There was a good deal of burn damage from the 2016 fires and possibly the site was covered with debris.  So walked to mile 76.1, a total of 6.8 miles from my 3 p.m. start at Dicks Creek Gap.  Found a nice flat site, wet of course.  Had hoped there'd be a spot left for me, and actually there was no one there but me. 
Trying stoveless this time.  Had a cold Mountain House chicken and dumplings meal that I put in a clean plastic peanut butter jar and rehydrated with cold water as I hiked.  When it's made with boiling water, I'd give it an 8 out of 10.  Cold, maybe a 5 out of 10.  But not bad.  Probably asleep by 8:30 p.m.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter
",Tentsite at mile 76.1,"Apr 23, Sun",2.30
Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562343,"Slept fairly well.  It drizzled all night.  Put my wet clothes back on, as nothing dried overnight, and wore today the extra pair of dry socks that I'd slept in the night before.  My plan was to let the wet socks from Sunday dry over the day, hanging on the back of my backpack.  Didn't happen--Darn Tough socks are darn tough to dry when it's a cool, overcast day.  Someone's new business venture should try to develop socks as good as Darn Toughs that also dry quickly.  
Wore knee compression sleeves on both knees today.  I think they're helpful.  Maybe the knees are a little less wobbly in them, so a little less inflamed at the end of the day. 
Continuing with the stoveless theme, I had cold oatmeal for breakfast and a packet of Via iced coffee, mixed with water in my smaller Nalgene.  Oatmeal wasn't bad.  The cold Via will take some getting used to.  I remember in my late teens getting used to drinking Tab, the first diet cola on the market.  If I could get used to Tab, maybe I could get used to cold coffee?  
Left the campsite about 8:40 a.m.  Walked a ridge for awhile.  Looked like I was level with the clouds.  Sun and clouds seemed to be in a battle all day, with the clouds winning.  Made it to the Georgia-NC border and even though I hadn't seen hardly anyone on the trail, another hiker approached right as I was trying to figure out how to take a selfie at the tree.  I took his picture, and he took mine.  Then a German couple packing up at the Bly Gap tentsite took my picture in front of the iconic tree.  
I lost time on the climbs, but tried to kick up the speed on even ground and gentle downhills.  Stopped for lunch at Muskrat Creek Shelter:  PB sandwich and Fritos. 
Kept checking the status of my wet Darn Tough socks all day, the ones supposedly drying on the back of my pack.  They were as wet at the end of the day as at the beginning.  My only other pair, the ones I was wearing, were wet, too.  
Passed Chunky Gal Trail sign.  Would like to know the story on that name.  Took a selfie I thought my husband might like.  Got to Standing Indian Shelter, about mile 86, about 5:20 p.m.  Went on to Standing Indian Mountain campsite, about 1.7 miles beyond the shelter.  I picked this campsite for today's photo.  It looked otherworldly with the burn damage and the clouds.  I had a cold Mountain House dehydrated meal for the second night in a row.  I gave last night's meal a 5 out of 10.  This one I give a 4 out of 10.  
Once again, I didn't see anyone else at the campsite.  Seems odd, I thought there were more people on the trail than this.  But maybe I'm behind the bubble, and maybe the other hikers are using this gloomy weather to get town errands done.","Tentsite at mile 76.1

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562415,"Going to try to update my journal again before this hike is a distant memory.  First time I wanted to write, I didn’t have good signal.  The next day my battery was too low to risk it.  Then the login was down due to the website change.  Then I wrote my update within the website, and lost it in a glitch when I clicked Submit.  Trying it again for the last time!

Woke up on the otherworldly Standing Indian Mountain, got packed up quickly, and headed off, eating a Poptart and drinking cold Via Iced Coffee from my Nalgene.   Put my snacks for the day into my backpack’s belt pockets.  I’d packaged the meals and snacks for each day in separate baggies, sorted by the day.  This helped me not have to root through my food bag with cold, wet hands, trying to select the day’s food.  I only had to find the “Tuesday” bag.  

Plan was 18.1 miles to Rock Gap Shelter.  Had a downhill from Standing Indian Mountain.  Started to play music through headphones for the first time while hiking.  It was a playlist of music I downloaded when I ran (ran/walked) the Indianapolis 500 mini-marathon a few years ago—mostly 60’s and 70’s pop/rock.  Definitely think music helped my speed improve on the uphills—a step faster, and a few less stops for breath.

My base weight had been 10 lbs, and with water and food it weighed 18 lbs when I left Dick’s Creek Gap on Sunday, as water sources were plentiful and I felt I could get by with carrying only 40 oz (24 oz + 16 oz) of water.  With 5 meals gone, I think the bag was under 15 lbs.  Last fall I hiked from Amicalola to Neels Gap carrying much more water due to the drought.   Plentiful water makes a huge difference in weight carried.  Section hiking also helps—don’t need to carry laundry day/extra clothes, don’t care about camp shoes, and this week I could leave my puffy jacket and winter gloves at home. 

Stopped for lunch at Carter Gap Shelter, then after a short distance I saw a fire tower on top of a mountain in the distance.  Had to be Albert Mountain.  All I could think was, “This crazy trail is going over that mountain!”  Kept thinking that if Grandma Gatewood did it, and if 70-year-old thru hikers did it, certainly I could do it.  Was glad I wasn’t climbing it in the cold, wind and ice, though.  Climbed the tower, saw the amazing view.  The walk down Albert Mountain was a gift from the gods.  Had expected a Blood Mountain-like descent, but this was a stroll in the park—no rocks, no roots, no knee-killing stepdowns.  Passed the tree with the “100” mile point marked with rocks.  

Reached Rock Gap Shelter about 7 p.m., found a decent site.  Wasn’t hungry for any more cold Mountain House meals.  If I’m going to go stoveless again, I need to think of something better than this.

Got a text from my friend Mrs. Knobby.  She was 7.5 miles ahead of me at Siler Bald Shelter.  Thought I’d try to get moving in the morning and try to catch her.","Tentsite at Standing Indian Mountain

Stopped at the parking lot at Winding Stair Gap.  A church group had left a styrofoam cooler with drinks and fruit.  Helped myself to a banana.  Worked to get my directions right, because I’d gone the wrong direction earlier today when first leaving the Rock Gap parking lot.  

Intended to stop at Siler Bald Shelter for lunch, but turned back when I realized it was further than I thought.  Walked a good distance and never saw the shelter.  

It’s a climb to get to the top of Wayah Bald, but at the top there’s a great surprise:  pavement!  Say what you want about how happy I was to see a paved sidewalk on the top of the mountain.  It was a nice, smooth walk to the tower.  And best of all, at the tower where she’d been waiting about 90 minutes, was Mrs. Knobby.  

It was too late in the day to think about going any farther than Wayah Shelter.  We talked most of the way, found a spot that could fit two tents with minimal slope, and promised we’d each try not to snore. 

We were both pretty whooped, thought we’d sleep well for sure, but it turns out that Mrs. Knobby fought leg cramps much of the night, and I turned like a rotisserie trying to relieve my aching hips.  But we both slept enough to try it again another day.","Rock Gap Shelter

We got to Tellico Gap around 2:45 p.m.  I couldn’t go as far as Mrs. Knobby, as I needed to be picked up at the parking lot to get back to my car at Dick’s Creek Gap and head to Fall Creek Falls State Park in Tennessee, in time to clean up and rest up for a conference the next day.  I waited till 4 p.m. for my shuttle ride, and she went on.

I’ll be back on the trail later in May, starting at Tellico Gap.  Not sure if it will be around the 19th or if I’ll need to wait till Memorial Day weekend.  It depends on my children’s plans.

I’ve been thinking about why the Appalachian Trail is so alluring.  Clearly there are the people, and the amazing, changing scenery.  There is the history.  There are the simple white blazes and humble log shelters.  There is the grand finale.  For me, there is a challenge to the trail, an analytical element, that a trail at a state park doesn’t offer.  You wake up and begin working on the day’s 500-piece puzzle.  It requires input from every part of your brain.  You think about how you feel, physically and mentally.  You analyze the upcoming campsites and the distances between them.  You factor in the time of sunrise and sunset.  You analyze the upcoming terrain and its impact on your day’s plans and energy.  You pull up the local town weather, and then estimate what that means for local mountain weather.  You analyze your pack, and calculate what to include and what to exclude based on your fears, your physical capability, the weather, and your personal assessment of how much comfort you need or are willing to forego.  You tally your food, the distances between food resupply.  You allocate rest stops to maintain cleanliness and to restore energy, so you can recover and continue.  The AT is both a simple and complex puzzle with hundreds of moving parts and a heart, requiring you to summon all that you’ve learned in life, but also asking you to trust that the trail and community of hikers will teach you and sustain you when what you know is not enough.","Wayah Shelter

If they're still on the trail, they're hundreds of miles ahead of me by now.  Even the folks my son and I met briefly in the frigid Tray Mountain shelter in mid-March--I still feel bonded with them and would love to know that they're doing OK.
Now doing the short Tellico Gap to Fontana Dam section.  Weather app shows gray clouds and thunderbolts, but when you have to ask off work weeks in advance, it is what it is.  Gave brief thought to canceling the trip, asked my husband what he thought--he said it was up to me. Decided I don't have the full AT experience if I'm just a fair-weather hiker.  Bringing a poncho and an extra pair of socks and preparing to be wet.  
Looking forward to seeing some of the milestones that thruhikers mention in their journals ... the NOC, Jacob's Ladder, Fontana Dam, Fontana Hilton.  It makes me feel like I'm getting somewhere!  If I knew for certain I'd be able to thruhike in a few years, I wouldn't do all these sections now. Pretty inefficient, and I never get my trail legs.  But I worry that if I wait to hike the AT until I have a 4-5-month block, some illness or commitment or other life event will intervene, and I'll regret that I never set foot on the trail.  
Penciling in an extended Fourth of July trip for the Smokies.  I dream of doing several more sections this year.  Would love to make it to Damascus before I hang it up for the winter.  But first things first.
The nice thing about sectioning is that it's easier to continuously evaluate and adjust my gear.  Still stoveless.  Trying out a new sleeping pad I got on sale, in my eternal quest for something that my aching hips will appreciate after a long day of hiking.  Since I'm just on the trail for 3 days, the pack is quite light.

Hike from Tellico Gap to the NOC didn't wear me out.  For a brief moment, I let myself think that I was in better shape than I gave myself credit for. My attempt to climb out of the NOC and make it to Cheoah Bald in the afternoon brought a dose of reality. Uphill 95% of the way, sometimes pretty steep. Rain started about 45 minutes before Swim Bald, and whatever wasn't covered by my poncho was wet through and through. Stopped and camped at Swim Bald, 1.9 miles before my hoped-for destination. 
The campsite at Swim Bald is at mile 142.6. It's not marked for tenting on Guthook, but it's the best campsite. I knew about it from Mrs. Knobby's journal. I slept like a baby for eight hours. The ground was as level as a tabletop. What a difference level ground makes. The weather was what my parents call ""perfect sleeping weather."" Probably younger people get tired of those of us 60+ describing how well we slept or didn't sleep. But I tell you, it's huge.
Woke up to the sound of raindrops on my tent. Laid there and tried to decide if it was raining, or if the wind was just blowing water off the leaves of nearby trees. It was the latter.
Once again, it's the people you meet and the shared experience that make this trail so unique. Hiked half the day yesterday with a young man, recently home from serving in Afghanistan.  Sounds as though he had a pretty rough upbringing, and joining the army, with all its pros and cons, saved him. He's a great kid. His savings are meager, and he's using a lot of his leftover army gear for the hike. Much, much heavier than required. He said at one point his loaded ruck weighed 80 pounds. His hiking pole is a single long stick, carved to a spear at the end. He said he killed a rattlesnake with it a few days ago. I believe him.
Only wildlife for me was an adorable box turtle in the middle of the trail.","Tellico Gap

They were resting. That was all I saw on the trail for 10 miles.
It was hot and humid today.  My t-shirt was soaked with sweat. Knees ached.  I felt more comfortable when hiking in March in 10-degree weather. Dreamed of a cold soft drink, and counted the minutes till I got to Fontana. Went to the first machine I saw. It took quarters and $1's. I had a credit card and $20's.  Hiked to the Fontana Hilton shelter and rested and drank water. It's truly beautiful, everything everyone has said.
Hiked to my car at the Visitors Center parking lot. The grill had just closed and the outdoor pop machine was out of order.  Stopped at the ""Pit Stop"" on my way out of town to buy a cold soda, and ran into the two men from England again. Got the impression today was rough on them, too.

I'd made it to Fontana Dam in June, and thought I might tackle the Smokies, or at least half the Smokies, over the July 4 break.  Goal is to make it NOBO to Damascus by late fall.  Route changed when I learned two of my children would be home for a couple of weeks and wanted to hike.  Decided to go SOBO from Grayson Highlands to Damascus, so we could tent rather than stay in shelters, as would be required in the Smokies.  Also wanted to see the ponies with the kids!
We'd hoped to get away early enough Friday to drive to the Massey Gap backcountry parking lot and hike 1-2 miles to Wise Shelter ... but I got away from work Friday morning later than I wanted, and then our dog needed to see the vet ... so as is often the case, we left later than hoped and we needed to rethink our plans.
Decided instead to drive to Damascus, arriving Friday around 9:45 p.m.  Peeked into The Place hostel to see if we could sleep there without disturbing anyone.  Both rooms had someone in a deep sleep on a lower bunk, snoring softly, and although other bunks were free, we didn't want to wake the sleeping hikers.  Tiptoed out and went across the street to the Dancing Bear Bed and Breakfast.  They had a room with a queen and a twin bed that worked for us.  It was a lovely home, very clean, and on Saturday morning we had an enjoyable breakfast with the owners and a few other hikers. 
Saturday, July 1, 14.7 miles
After a relaxing breakfast at the Dancing Bear, Brian, Colleen and I drove to the Massey Gap backcountry parking lot.  Hiked up the spur trail to the AT, about mile marker 501.0, and then headed SOBO starting around 10:45 a.m.   The ponies were out!  Saw them, petted them ... took our time just savoring the views and the animals.  We had thought we'd only hike 11-12 miles, but decided to keep going past Buzzard Rock, even thought it meant night hiking in the rain.  Got to a small campsite about 10 p.m., mile 486.3, for 14.7 miles on the AT.  Set up tents with our headlamps on.  We each had our own tent and fell asleep to soft rain on our roofs.","Massey Gap Backcountry Parking Lot

It was great to follow the Virginia Creeper bike trail.  Loved seeing families enjoying biking together--and loved finding some easy terrain, too, on such a hot day.  We camped by Laurel Creek at mile 474.8, for an 11.5-mile day. Cleaned up a lot of food and trash that previous campers had left. I can't understand how people can leave a campsite littered like that.

A lot of hikers write about how a long-ago hike with their parents inspired them to want to hike the AT.  My guess (and hope) is that weekend hikes like this will inspire my children and their future families to hike the trail someday.  It is such a great memory.

Adding in the last 3 days' 31.8 miles to the Trail Journals counter is going to confuse things a little.  I've hiked from Springer to Fontana Dam, and now from Massey Gap south to Damascus.  Need to fill in the Fontana Dam to Damascus section over the fall.  Then the mile tracker will again correlate with my NOBO location on the trail.","Campsite at Laurel Creek

This is the same boy that hiked with me the second week in March, when it was 5° the night we tented at Tray Mountain shelter.  If he was willing to give it another go, I would find a way to make it happen.So even though my general plan is to hike sequentially north, I'm flexible if it means time with the kids. I tried to find a section that was about a four-hour drive for him (New York) and no more than 8-9 hours for me (Indiana).  The Smokies would work for me, but not for him.It was a fun puzzle, finding the right section of the trail, with safe parking locations for beginning and ending our hike, and shelters spaced just right for a Friday evening start and a Sunday morning finish. I probably spent a good two hours with the AWOL and Guthook guides, analyzing and calculating. I think I got it right. We met early Friday evening at Pine Grove Furnace State Park in southern PA, and parked one car behind the AT Museum. Drove the other car to the AT parking lot at Caledonia State Park. Hiked a short 2.2 miles to the amazing Quarry Gap Shelter. It was dark when we got there, but people  were still awake. A father and his two young sons were working on a fire. Two girls were on the swing, and others were just visiting at a picnic table. We had planned to tent, but all the sites we could see were taken. There were a couple spots left in one of the two shelter rooms. It's the cleanest, loveliest shelter, testimony to what a dedicated, creative caretaker can do.Once again, I'm going to throw  out-of-order miles into my overall calculation. They'll throw you off if you're thinking I'm sectioning straight NOBO.  But I know where I'm at, what I've done and not done, and what gaps need to be filled in.

A bear box designed to look like a wishing well. Shelter floors that were sanded smooth and painted. I am in awe of the caretaker and the TLC he gives the shelter.
We didn't leave until after 9 AM. Met a SOBO hiker, Cuckoo, who started at Katahdin on June 5.  Visited with two older men (my age) who were hiking. One started at Springer 4 months ago, gradually heading north. His home is in Massachusetts. The other had taken Amtrak from Washington state and was doing a 6-week section hike. Enjoyed meeting them and hearing their stories.
When you're used to Georgia and North Carolina, and all of a sudden start hiking in southern Pennsylvania, it feels amazing to see miles and miles of fairly flat trail. That means no mountaintop views, but it was OK by me. 
Stopped at the Milesburn cabin, which the PATC rents to people, and visited with the family staying there this weekend. They gave us extra homemade bread, which was delicious.

It's funny what even 40 hours on the trail does to your appetite. The General Store that serves the half gallon ice cream challenge was open. Got a cheeseburger that was priced higher than what I'm used to paying--it was fantastic. Ben said the same about his BLT wrap.
The AT museum was open, so we took about 15 minutes to go through it before we left for home.

It's finally happening. My daughter Colleen came home from Montana for two weeks, and we planned a night at Fontana and then 5 nights in the Smokies.  It will work if the weather works on our side ... and that's iffy.  It was a little tough figuring it out ... I worked out a plan, then sat down to reserve shelters ... and was crushed to see that some of the shelters I thought we should stay at were completely booked on the nights we wanted to be there.  Another was closed due to bear activity.  Had to change our hiking schedule to a combination of shorter days and longer days in order to have shelter spots.  Will need decent weather to do the longer days.  
Hoped to get away from work by 11:30 a.m. today, to get to Fontana Dam Shelter by 7 p.m.  Instead, got away at noon, then on the way home to pick up my daughter, my car's low tire pressure light came on.  The last time it came on I had a flat 10 minutes later.  Stopped at the dealership to have the tires checked ... apparently all 4 were a little low, but no nails ... but it cost another hour.   Uggghh.  Hate getting to shelters late, possibly waking up worn-out hikers. 
Finally got to Fontana Dam Shelter about 8:30 p.m.  A couple who looked to be in their early 70's were getting some things out of their car, next to where we parked.  They had already been down to the shelter.  I'd brought our tent, and planned to set it up if we got to the shelter so late that we'd wake up people.  But the couple said no, the two hikers there were awake, and one was heading to the shower, so we were OK.
Walked down to the shelter, pitch black, headlamp on medium.  Got close to the shelter and from a sleeping bag, someone from the bottom level says, not in a friendly way, ""Would you put your lamp on red!""  Okay ... maybe the hikers aren't so awake.  I say I'm sorry, and we climb to the top and set up for bed, as quietly as we can.","Home

Reached Mollie's Ridge close to dark.  A ridge runner was spending the night there, and after we'd eaten and gotten into our bags, another hiker showed up, too.  The ridge runner had lowered the shelter's heavy tarp, helping immeasurably to warm the inside from the cold wind.","Fontana Dam

Stopped at Spence Field Shelter for a snack.  Its tarp was down so the shelter it was at least 10-15 degrees warmer inside than outside.  Heard some noise, looked outside, and along clopped a guide on a dapple gray horse, leading a group on horseback.  Beautiful horses.  The guide said he'd been a school principal further south for much of his life, and now he gave horseback tours through the Smokies.

It was dark when we got to Derrick Knob Shelter.  Other hikers were trying to fall asleep.  We ate quickly and got in our bags as quietly as we could.  I didn't want to keep anyone awake, so I didn't change into my sleep clothes.  There wasn't a tarp in front of the shelter, so it was colder than Mollies Ridge.  Our bags were warm.  I made up my mind that whether I had sleeping shelter-mates or not, we needed to start earlier the next morning.  It gets dark early, about 6:30 p.m., and I didn't want to arrive at the next shelter in the dark.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580119,"It was pouring rain and just above freezing when I awoke at 6:30 a.m.  There's something soothing about the rain hitting a shelter roof while you lay snug and warm in a sleeping bag.  Our backpacks were outside the shelter, up on a bear cable, wrapped in a 55-gal contractor bag to protect them from the rain.  Despite my vow to leave earlier in the day, no one else in the shelter was awake.  I didn't want to start packing up and wake the others.  An hour later, still no one was awake.  Finally about 8-8:30 a.m., people were moving.  It continued to rain.  Got the packs down from the cable--they were both dry.  Fixed coffee and oatmeal, and despite the best of intentions, it was 9-10 a.m. before we left the shelter, bundled up with rain jackets, rain kilts, and ponchos to cover our packs.  
In my 62 years I've not seen many days like this where the rain never took a break.  It rained from before sun-up until after we went to bed.  The trail was a river.  Shoes and socks were soaked.  Our cores were warm, but our fingers and toes were wet and cold.  Gloves were soaked.  Stopped now and then and wrung them out.   Stopped twice, briefly, at Siler's Bald Shelter and Double Spring Gap Shelter, but neither had tarps down so they didn't offer much warmth.  Saw some SOBOs who said there was snow coming, and the road to Newfound Gap was closed.
I'd wanted to hike faster than I did.  I was too afraid of slipping if I hiked as fast as my daughter.  I wouldn't be of any help to anyone if I fell and broke a wrist or an ankle, trying to keep up with the Joneses.  I found a speed that worked for me, slow enough to be safe from slipping, fast enough to see some progress.
Once again, we arrived at a shelter in the dark.  Ugghh.  Before we got there, I told my daughter that if everyone was asleep, we wouldn't make supper--we'd just go straight to bed and have a decent breakfast in the morning.  The trail provides.  We arrived at Mt. Collins Shelter--0.4 miles off the trail--to find 4 guys, a girl, and a dog wide awake, having a great time visiting with each other.  The guys were high school friends who had parked at Newfound Gap and hiked the 4.8 miles south to Mt. Collins, just for the night. They would be heading back to their car at Newfound Gap the next day.  The girl was a solo section hiker.  It was soooo wonderful they were all awake--it meant we could make a hot supper, hang up all our wet things, hang the packs on the bear cables, and get our dry sleeping clothes on--all before they were ready to turn in.  There was no tarp, so the shelter was colder than it might have been.  The rain that was present when we woke up in the morning was still coming down. Fell asleep to the steady drum of rain hitting the shelter roof.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Decade,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580120,"It was strangely quiet when I woke this morning.  Raised my head and looked out of the shelter--snow!  Not sure when the rain ended and the snow began, but the world outside the shelter was white.  Our wet clothes hanging from pegs and lines were frozen stiff.  I'd had to slow my pace in the rain, and now I would have to slow my pace even more in the snow.  The plan was to make it to Peck's Corner Shelter, mile 217.1, or 14.6 miles, plus a 0.4-mile side trip from the trail to the shelter.  I knew what my pace would be if I were cautious enough to avoid slipping--probably 40-minute miles.  Another shelter arrival in the dark.  
The girl in the shelter was ready to get off the trail.  It was supposed to get colder all day, and be in the teens tonight, before it started warming up sometime tomorrow.  The guys had a car and a truck at Newfound Gap.  They offered to drive the girl to her car, parked at a trailhead not far from where mine was parked at Fontana Dam.  They said they'd take us to our car too, if we wanted.  I hadn't planned to get off the trail.  First I said no, I was good.  I would make it, I was prepared, I had a 0-degree bag.  Then I caught my daughter's eyes and thought again.  Her clothes were wet and cold.  We'd had a good time, a great time.  I didn't have anything to prove.  Maybe those particular guys were put in the shelter for a reason ... to help us get off the trail before an injury.  It was my goal to finish the Smokies this trip, but my daughter's goal was simply to have an enjoyable hike.  I accepted.
We hiked in snow and slush and cold to Newfound Gap, about 5 miles since the Mt. Collins Shelter sits 0.4 mile off the trail.  Their cars were warm by the time I got there.  The road out of Newfound Gap was closed, but the park service had put a paper under the guys' windshields that had a code to the padlock on the gates blocking the road.  The guys couldn't have been nicer.  Not sure what a shuttle from Newfound Gap to Fontana would have cost--it was more than an hour of driving--but they didn't want to be paid.  I said no way, gave them $100, and asked them to find a restaurant and have a nice, warm dinner.  They agreed on that condition.
As my daughter and I drove north, the day was clear and bright.  No snow.  It was hard to believe that we'd left cold and snow on the mountains, bad enough to close a road, when everywhere else it was a beautiful fall day.
This will probably be the end of my sectioning for 2017.  I have an assignment outside the US from January until early April 2018, so it will be late spring before I get back to Newfound Gap and continue north.
Best wishes to everyone still on the trail.  Be safe.","Mt. Collins Shelter
