Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551757,"Where to begin...First I think I should start by explaining how this idea came to be. Most people know that I am an avid bicycle rider. This year I have put over 1,500 miles on my bicycle. My miles fail to compare to my friends Jeff and Donna Sanders' miles.   I really have no idea how many miles they have so far this year, but I do know they are responsible for this idea. This year Jeff and Donna rode their bicycles across the US. They started in Washington DC and finished in Washington State.   As they were preparing for this trip, we had several discussions about their trip. Those discussions lead me to wonder if that is something I could do. Ultimately I decided that if I was going to do something like that, I would probably choose to hike instead of bike.   Hiking is something I have done several time, not quite to this extent, but I have spent 10 days in the woods hiking in New Mexico when I was younger.   As much as I enjoy my bike, I am not sure my ass could take 90 days in the saddle. As my curiosity continued to peak about Jeff and Donna's trip, I started looking into long hiking trips. In the US there are 3 major hiking trips you can take.   You have the Appalachian Trail (AT), The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and Continental Divide Trail (CDT). After researching each of these, I decided that the AT would probably be the best fit for me at this time. Some of the reasons I decided this were:  1. The AT is a 3 season trip. You don't have to worry about extreme cold temperatures, which helps keep your pack weight down.  2. The AT has more connection with civilization. You will/can head into Town every 3-5 days in most situations on the AT. This convenience allows you to carry less food, ability to obtain replacement for equipment, and access to laundry, showers, and shelter if needed. 3. Finally the AT doesn't have the drastic elevation changes the other two trails have.   The highest point on the AT is just over 6,000 Feet.At this point I really had no intention of setting off the AT. I had actually joked that I would set a goal to hike it in 2020, which put me at the ripe age of 45.   Still the idea intrigued me enough that I started doing some research, reading articles/blogs, and watching YouTube videos.   The more I read and watched the more excited I became about someday actually hiking this. During my research I learned too many things to go into detail about, but the one important thing I learned was the definition of a ""Thru-Hiker"" A Thru-Hiker is someone who hikes the entire trail without taking a long break. When I say long break I am talking about months, not days.   One thing that will happen on the trail are Zero Days. I will explain those later.   To Thru-Hike the Appalachian trail you have 3 options: 1. Northbound (Georgia to Maine (NOBO)) The Most Popular 2. Southbound (Maine to Georgia (SOBO)) The more difficult terrain to start 3. FlipFlop (Starting in the middle, hiking to on Terminus and then traveling back to your starting point and hiking to the other Terminus of the trail.) This is the easiest terrain to start.For me this was never about a midlife crisis as one of my friend's (Rob) tries to put it, this is about me wanting to do something that I have always enjoyed doing, but never would have set aside the time to do it.   Luckily for me the right time for this opportunity came much much sooner than I expected...",,An Idea/Adventure is Born,"Nov 23, Wed",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551915,"Timing is everything...How many times have you told yourself I would love to do something if I could find the time or were presented an opportunity to do something but you couldn't because the time wasn't right.   Luckily for me the changes in my life this summer opened up an opportunity for me to make a decision. In June, my girlfriend and I decided to go our separate ways, leaving me with extra time on my hands and a renewed freedom that, in the past, has allowed me to have all the great experiences in my life. This life change started the germination of the idea of a thru hike.   I began stockpiling websites for reading, added current and past hikers blogs to my daily reading, and started a list of the gear needed to complete this journey. Side Note: If you want to better understand what a Thru-Hike is like read some of the blogs of the past hikers.   You can find them here: http://appalachiantrials.com/As I am going through this process of gathering information, I also took a look at where I am at in life and what I still wanted to accomplish. I will spare you the details of that thought process, but the end result was, I believe that if I put my life on hold for the next 6 months, I wouldn't have a problem picking back up where I left it. One key component to this thought was needing to reduce my bills to the bare minimum while I was on the trail.   Over the years I have done a pretty good job of keeping my debt in line so this process should be quite easy for me. 1. My truck is already paid off, I will have my insurance for it put on hold while I am gone.   2. I will sell my house, which was something I was already planning on doing after the break up. 3. I will use some of the equity from my home sale to payoff the minimal dept I have4. I will keep my Life and Medical insurance while on the trail.5. I will add a monthly cost for a storage unit to store my possessions. So now the question is, what non monetary concerns did I have about hitting pause for 6 months.   To be honest these were/are the biggest obstacles for me to come to terms with. Hiking for 6 months, starting in March, means missing all of the summer, and into the fall.   This means:* No RAGBRAI with my team, and at best minimal bicycle riding before I go.* No canoe trips with my friends.* No summer shenanigans (insert Super Troopers Reference Here) with my friends.* Missing my dogs (Saydee & Asher) dearly, having to find a place for both of them to stay.* Missing my family, and watching my nieces/nephews/god-son/other friends kits in all the summer sporting events they are involved...which there are so many.   * Missing my niece's (Sorry Kyann, I will make sure I make it up to you) graduation.I could continue to list many more things, ultimately it comes down to me deciding if I can live without these things in my life for 6 month.   I spent plenty of hours weighing the pros and cons of each of my concerns, in the end I concluded that the sacrifice will be worth the experience. These are the once in a lifetime opportunities that happen, and I am lucky enough to have this opportunity and timing cross paths for me.",,Making a Decision,"Nov 28, Mon",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551956,"Revealing my plans to friends, family, and people I meet, creates two initial reactions.   First people pretend they didn't hear me correctly and repeat it back to me, Second they ask me if I am crazy. After I have assured that they heard me correctly, then the questions begin.   Here are the most common questions and answers to those questions.1. How long is this trail?   A. The Appalachian Trail changes each year, they tend to add miles to the trail.   The trail was 2,190 miles in 2016. It crosses 14 states. 2. How long will you be gone?   A. That really depends on so many factors.   Pace, injury, rest days taken...   On average it takes a little less than 6 months to finish the entire trail.   Last year a little over 2000 people attempted this hike and typically only 25% of them will finish it in the same year.3. What will you do for food.   A. The Appalachian Trail passes through or close to towns every 3-5 days in most parts. This allows you to resupply you food frequently, which also helps to keep your pack weight down. (This is very important as I will explain in another entry)4. What will you do for shelter?   A. I will be taking an ultralight tent to sleep in, however the trail has shelters/huts/lean-to's about every 5-7 miles.   Some are very large, sleeping up to 40 people and some are small, sleeping 5-7 people.   These are another option for hikers. In addition there are several Hostels along the trail, for a price, and hotels in town. 5. What about Showering?   A. This is probably the question where most people determine they couldn't do it.   On the trail, there will are not showers.   However, when you go to town or stay in a hostel, you will be able to pay for a shower. Some people will do hippy showers, AKA use a wet wipe, some people won't shower, and some people will use some sort of camp soap and a towel or bandanna. One thing is for sure, Thru-Hikers are known for their smell. My plan is to do a little of all of these to keep clean.6. What Cloths are you bringing?   A. One of the most important concepts for a successful hike is keeping your pack weight down. For this reason, clothing will be kept to a minimum. Because I will be hiking in the early spring, using layers is a critical component to keeping warm, yet clothing to a minimum. I won't go into detail on all my cloths, but here is the 10k foot view.   I will have 2 shirts, 2 pair of shorts, 2 pair of Underwear, 3 pair of socks, rain gear, 1 pair of long underwear, and a down jacket. This usually leads to the next question...7. What about Laundry?   A. Similar to Showers, Laundry on the trail is either none or you hand wash.   Problem with hand washing is not knowing if your cloths will be dry by the time you want to put them back on.    The trail is known to be very rainy and damp.   Once in town or at Hostels, you will have the opportunity to wash cloths in one fashion or another.   In other words, your deal with the stink, there is no way to avoid this when hiking.8. Are you taking a gun, mace, knife, any protection?   A. This is the question that make me laugh.   The answer is no, I am not taking anything for protection. I will take a small pocket knife for cutting but it won't protect me.   On the trail there are 3 potential animals to worry about.   Black Bears, Timber Rattlers, and Copperhead Snakes. As long as you are paying attention, none of these are a real threat to Humans.   Black Bears want to run away from you, unless you are between you and their cubs.   In that case, slowly back away and don't pose as a threat.   Snakes, as long as you don't step on them, you can avoid them, or move them off the trail with your trekking poles. 9. Who are you going with?   A. Myself. As I stated earlier there are about 2000 people who attempt this hike each year.   When I start my hike I will be starting it will many other people.   There will be a natural gravitation to hike with people who are hiking at a similar pace and fit with in your comfort zone for personality. Through all of my education and research, one thing that is a constant is the people who are hiking the trail are a ""family"" They look out for each other and will go out of their way to help a fellow hiker in need.   So I don't anticipate that I will be hiking alone very much on the trail.",,Answers to Some of Your Questions,"Nov 29, Tue",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552038,"Now that I have made the decision that I am going to hike the trail in the Spring of 2017 its time to start looking at what I will need to make the trip. At this point in my research process, there has been one clear message in all the blogs, journals, and gear lists...""The lighter your pack, the better chance you have of success.""
I have experience in multi-day hiking. As a youth, I did spend 10 days hiking 70 plus miles at Philmont Boyscout camp in New Mexico. We had to carry all our food for the 10 days, which equated to 65 lbs packs. At that time, that was probably half my body weight.....I swear...there are pictures to prove it. 
Through everything I had read, I came out with a goal of having total pack weight of about 25 lbs. This includes everything I would need for the entire trip. The nice thing about the Appalachian Trail is that you can go into town every 3-5 days for food resupplies. A critical fact that helps keep your pack weight down. I will get into the details of the food in another entry. 
For the sack of this Entry, this means my food and water weight will be about 10 LBS, bringing my remaining available pack weight to 15 LBS if I want to keep to the 25 LBS goal. This is called ""Base Weight"" of your pack. A 15 LBS base weight is considered a light weight in terms of pack weight. There are hikers out there that have both heavier and lighter base weights. Once you see what items I am carrying, you will see it would be difficult for me to get my base weight down much more than I already have it.
Let take a moment to put this in perspective....15 LBS base weight, must include the following: Backpack, Tent, Sleeping System, Clothes, Cooking System, and Toiletries. This means every ounce counts. So, the research begins.
The first thing I researched was backpacks. For Philmont, I had and external frame backpack. At my age, this thing was huge, it stuck out about, what seemed like, 2 feet above my head. External packs are/were designed for heavier weight, and considering this was over 20 years ago, technological advancements have improved. For the AT, I would be using an internal framed backpack. Theses packs tend to be lighter in design and based on my expected pack weight, this would meet my needs. One of most popular brands is Osprey ATMOS AG65. These packs are well known for their comfort and Durability. Unfortunately, these packs are also close to 5 lbs. Leaving me with only 10LBs of room for my remaining items. However, I did purchase an Osprey ATMOS AG 65, and did a couple of local hikes with it. I found the pack to be very comfortable, but was having a hard time dealing with the extra weight it had in comparison to other available packs and the fact that I would need a pack cover to keep the water out….so I sent it back. I ended up purchasing a Hyperlite Mountaingear 3400 Windrider. This pack weighs 2lbs, and is semi-waterproof. I find that this pack is very comfortable and I like the simplistic design. This is the pack I have chosen to take with me on the AT
Now that I have my Pack, I have a remaining base weight of 13lbs, now I needed my sleep system. Getting a good night’s sleep on the AT is another common theme in my research. Because you are hiking between 10-20 miles a day, up and down mountains, you are pretty beat and you want to spend as little time as possible setting up you sleep system. First up, the tent.
There are several different types of tents available, since I am on a weight budget, the lighter the better. Some hikers will use what are called Tarp Tents, basically, these tents are tarps that use your trekking poles to hold them up. They are very light weight and you eliminate the need for tent poles. In the end, I decided to go with a 3 season ultra-light tent. It will have tent poles, but is still light at a 2.75 lbs for the entire set up. Now that I am protected from the elements, I need something to keep me warm at night.
Since I am hiking in early March, and the fact that we will be in the mountains, there will be some cold nights on the trail. Down is the only way to go to keep the weight down and ensure you are warm at night. You can either have a down sleeping bag or you can choose to use a down quilt. Either way there is a good chance you will want some sort of padding below you when you are sleeping. Down is a great light weight option, but it loses its warmth when compressed. Given the fact that you will need a pad to sleep on, I decided to go with a down quilt and a thermal sleeping pad. This combination will keep me warm to 20 degrees. I also am taking a silk sleeping bag liner. This will be used for added warmth in the cold nights as well as a light cover in the warmer nights of the summer. Total weight for this is 2.6 lbs. Remaining available weight….7.65 lbs, next up Cooking, Clothing, and Toiletries.",,Gear Research,"Dec 02, Fri",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552138,"Now we get to the part where most people really question my sanity.   I have 7.65 lbs left and have to pack all my cooking gear, clothing, and Toiletries.   One thing I mentioned earlier but didn't get too in depth here, I actually don't weigh things in pounds, everything is weighed in ounces...but for the sake of this Journal I am trying to keep it simple. When doing a thru-hike, you are tired and as with setting up your sleeping, you want to take as little time as possible cooking your meals.   Typically, both breakfast and lunch will be something that doesn't require any cooking. Dinner, could go either way.   Most of the food that you will cook will be basic and only require hot water.   There won't be any elaborate meals, and as little extra cooking as possible.   Because of this, cook gear is basic.   You need a stove, fuel, something to light it with, a pot, and a eating utensil. I will do another entry on the type of food and the process I will use to cook. Total my cook gear weights 1.62 lbs, leaving me with just over 6 lbs.We will save clothing for last, next up is toiletries. Toiletries, includes first aid kit, if you want to call it that. For first aid, I am taking some band-aids, Leukotape (For Blisters), some super glue, and some Neosporin.   Any injury that can't be fixed using those items, will require a trip to town. Unfortunately, having a private bathroom on the trail isn't going to happen.   So you have two choices, one you can wait an hope there is an outhouse at your next shelter (Privy), or you can go in the woods.   Either way you are going to need to supply your own TP and somehow wash your hands.   In an effort to avoid TP from falling apart in the rain, I will be taking along some paper towels cut down to fit in a zip-lock.    I know first everyone's thinking, ouch, but after some research, Viva Paper towels are pretty closes to the comforts of double ply TP.   For washing my hands I will take two options, one I am taking a travel size Purell, second I am taking some camp soap dissolving sheets. These work great all you have to do is add a little water and you are lathered up.   Additional toiletries I will be taking. Tooth brush & paste, nail clippers, tweezers, floss, sewing needle, and some chap-stick.   Total this adds up to .87 lbs. Now I have 5.16 lbs remaining for Cloths and Misc Items.Here are the Misc items I am taking and a snippet of why I am taking them.1. Headlamp - There will be days when I will be hiking after dark, and I will need the ability to see around camp.2. Seat Cushion - As I stated earlier, the AT does get rain, and these cushions make sure you have a dry place to sit.3. Phone Case - I have a case on my phone, the one for the AT will be drop, water and dust proof.4. Phone Charger - since I am taking my Go Pro, Phone, and my Garmin Watch, I will need the ability to charge items on the trail. This charger will keep me going until I get to town.5. Small Pocket Knife - Not for protection, but used to cut rope, sticks for fires, anything you might need to cut.6. My Go Pro - I have a clip that allows me to attach it directly to my shoulder strap of my pack or my baseball cap if I want.7. Earbuds & mini portable speaker - To keep my sanity and to help pass the time, Music, and Audio books will be used.8. Head Net - The mosquito's, flies, & gnats are going to be bad, keeping them out of my face will be a huge help. 9. Bear Bag System - Since we will be in bear country we will need to keep our food safe, hanging bear bags in trees, will be the solution....maybeTotal weight, 1.89 lbs, remaining weight for clothing... 3.27 lbs.Remember at the beginning of this post, I mentioned that this is where you will question my sanity...when you read this you will know why. Remember, on average, this trip will take 6 months....I will repeat that 6 months.   Here is a list of the cloths I am taking with a brief reason for why.1. Underwear (2 Pair) - Truth be told, some hikers only go with 1 pair. I plan on alternating pairs each day, allowing me to use my camp soap to help keep them semi clean until I can get to town and do laundry. Plus, when it rains it will be nice to change into a dry pair. 2. Shorts (2 Pair) - One pair will be for hiking, the second will be for changing into once I arrive at my final destination each night.3. Pants (1 Pair) - As of this Journal I am still debating taking these. You don't need them when hiking, if I wear my long underwear.   My guess is I will leave these home to cut down on weight.4. Long Underwear (1 Pair) - Since we will be in the mountains in spring, having these will be important to keeping warm.   5. Rain Pants (1 Pair) - These will probably be sent home once the temperatures allow. There will be no way to avoid being wet on the trail, and as long as your are warm, you will not need rain gear.6. Rain Jacket (1) - See Rain Pants....I may try to keep the jacket, but from what I read, it won't keep me dry anyway.   Either you get rained on or you sweat.7. Shirts (1 Long Sleeve/1 Short Sleeve) - I will be hiking in the long sleeve shirt for as long as I can stand. The short sleeve will serve as something to change into when in camp.8. Socks (3 Pair) - 2 Pair for hiking, and 1 pair for camp.9. Sock Liners (2 Pair) - These will help prevent blisters and to help keep the moisture off my feet.10. Down Puffy Jacket - This will be my warmth anytime I feel cold.   Since it is down, it will keep me warm in any condition I might run into on the trail.11.   Fleece Hat/Balaclava/Gloves - Again Items I will send home once temperatures allow.12. Camp Shoes - After hiking all day, letting your feet dry and air out will be important.   Your feet are the MOST important thing on this trip, I will do everything in my power to keep them feeling right. 13. Hiking Shoes - There is a long debate on taking hiking boots or using trail runners. I will be using trail runners for the trip. They are lighter and dry much quicker than hiking boots.Total, 3.64 lbs, leaving me .37 lbs over my goal. My OCD kicks in now, I need to cut .37 lbs from my weight...so I am constantly searching for ways to shave off the ounces.",,Remaining Gear,"Dec 05, Mon",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552266,"On average you will burn between 5,000 and 6,000 calories per day while hiking on the AT. This means just to maintain my current weight, I would need to replenish all those calories....Good thing I could stand to lose a little weight.Above is a picture of what I will typically be eating when I am on the trail. This picture has 3,400 calories in it, leaving me at a minimum deficit of 1,600 calories each day. They say that men on average will lose between 20-40 lbs and women will actually gain weight from the muscle build up.   Looking at this picture you will notice, this diet isn't the healthiest.   Its not meant to be. As with everything, weight is one of the two driving factors in food choices. Calorie per ounce is the mantra I will live by on the trail. The second driving factor to determine food is ease of preparation. Knowing each day is a minimum of 8 hours of hiking, most Thru-Hikers don't want to waste time cooking food for each meal.   When they do decide to cook, which is usually only supper, they are tired and don't want to put too much effort into it. Breakfast - something quick and high calorie, with little healthy nutrients. The Honey Bun donut product, if you would call it that, is very popular.   There is 500 calories in just one of those Honey Buns, of which half is sugar.   Hikers use this sugar high to start their daily hikes, knowing they will be crashing in about an hour. Other popular breakfast options are; Pop tarts, Peanut-butter and Jelly tortillas, Oatmeal w/dried milk, Cereal (Dry or w/dried milk), Oreo's, M&M's and Skittles (Any Hard Candy). Fortunately for me, I am not a fan of donuts, so I am planning on passing on the Honey Buns, and will stick with the Pop Tarts w/PB or PBJ Tortillas.   I am sure over 6 months, I will change it up, but for now that is my plan.Second Breakfast - Once the initial sugar crash occurs, I will need to refuel.   This is something that I can eat while hiking. Cliff Bars, Granola Bars, and Apple Sauce, basically anything I can grab from my hip belt pocket without stopping. Lunch - Lunch will be a change to drop my pack, rest my feet and muscles.   Cooking is an option, its not something I am planning on doing. Packaged Tuna/Chicken/Salmon and tortillas are popular with hikers.    Other foods include, salami, hard cheese (lasts longer than you thing), Bagels, or PBJ tortilla's again. Anything I can find that I don't have to cook will be an option. Still not very healthy, but is much better than breakfast.Afternoon Snack - Similar to Second Breakfast, this will be something that doesn't require me to stop hiking. Candy bars, trail mix, M&M's, beef jerky, salami, dry cereal are all on the menu. Supper - This is the one meal that I plan to cook to start my trip. I have read many other blogs, where hikers decided to quick cooking while on the trail.   They find they are just too tired to go through the process.   Cooking supper is not going to be anything gourmet. Basic principal is to boil some water and add it to what every substance I plan on eating.   Instant Noodles, Mash Potatoes, and some sort of Meat Product is my plan to start. There is a unique way to do this on the trail, and I will get into that in my next Journal Entry. Additional food options - Since I will need to resupply my food every 3-5 days, I will have the ability to eat in town. This is typically where hikers make up for the calorie deficits from the trail.   Reading about the amount of food hikers can eat while in towns is entertaining.   It amazes me at how much food they eat. Example; One book, can't remember which one, the person had 2 dozen wings, a large pizza, and cheese bacon fries for supper. Needless to say, this is going to be an interesting trip.Another benefit to hitting towns to resupply, bringing town food back on the trail.   Sub sandwiches are the perfect food to bring back. This give you an added variety to your diet.Although the diet on the trail is unique, its not something that concerns me. I am not a picky eater, and don't mind mixing food that normally don't go together (Tuna and Honey maybe?).   I don't expect to be able to maintain a 5,000 calorie diet while hiking, but I do know you have to keep eating to ensure you have the ability to finish.",,Calories In vs Calories Out,"Dec 08, Thu",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552312,"Cooking on the AT is not required, there are several thru-hikers who decide not to cook or give up cooking all together at some point in the hike. When they do decide to cook, they want to make it as painless as possible.   The Majority of the meals that are cooked only require boiling water. That is why you see people eating instant mash potatoes, seasoned pasta dishes, and ramen noodles.There are several different cooking systems that hikers use to boil the water. The most common is the canister stoves.   You have a stove that screws into a gas canister, and a pot that goes on top.   This is the type I will be using and is pictured above. It allows you to bring the water to a boil quicker and turn off the flame to save fuel. Another option is an alcohol stove.   This is a much lighter way to boil water, but is not as efficient.   Alcohol stove use any type of flammable fluid, most hikers choose to use Heet fuel injector cleaner. This is something that every gas station has, which makes it easy to obtain when on the trail.   Using this stove is simple, you pour a little of the Heet into a modified soda can, place the pot on top.   Alcohol stoves do not burn as hot as gas, and will take much longer to bring the water to a boil. Also, you can't just shut off the alcohol when you are done, you must let the Heet burn out. Once you have your boiling water, the next step is a hikers preference. You can add your dinner to the pot and let it simmer, or you can pour that water into a Ziploc bag, which then will be placed into a cozy to allow the heat simmer your dinner for you. In the picture above, you will see what my cozy looks like, basically it is an insulated bag, that will keep the heat from the water around the Ziploc, and continue to cook whatever is in the Ziploc.   Using this cozy serves two purposes; First it allows you to cook multiple meals.   My pot holds two cups of water, which is the same amount of water required to make one package of noodles or potatoes. Second, using the cozy does the simmering for you, so you don't have to waste gas simmering the food in the pot. Once the food is ready, using a long spork (pictured above), you can pull your Ziploc out of your cozy, and eat your dinner right out of the bag. This eliminates the need to clean your pot and the need to have a bowl to eat from.",,Cooking on the AT,"Dec 09, Fri",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552551,"They say Hiking the Appalachian Trail is more mental than physical. You have to be mentally prepared to do the same things, eat the same foods, and wear the same cloths every day for 6 months.   In addition you have to deal with all the elements that Mother Nature is going to throw out you. Having the right state of mind to do this will be critical in my success of completing the trail.Prior to deciding on doing the trail, I already knew the monotony of day to day activities I would have to endure. It is something I know I will be able to handle, and hasn't deterred me so far.   Knowing and doing are two different things, once I actually start doing, there is no question, it is going to be a challenge to maintain my sanity. I am not a dirty person by nature, I have to take a shower at least once a day, and sometime more.   So the idea of having one set of clothes, that are going to smell really really bad, will be a new experience for me. Knowing these challenges are coming prior to my trip allows me the opportunity to mentally prepare.A key component to my preparation is making a list of why and what I want to get out of this experience, what I will do when I successfully complete the trail and what happens if I fail. I will take this list with me on the trail to allow me to refer to it anytime.   Giving myself a clear message to reference will keep me on point and remind me of the enthusiasm I have today, as that enthusiasm fades.Another component is knowing this trip will be a mental roller coaster. Reading books and other Thru-hikers blogs has allowed me to experience and understand that there are going to be both good and bad days.   These books also give great advise on how to handle the ups and downs. A common solution to the up and downs is to never make a decision to quit on a down day.   If you start to get that feeling, the best thing to do is to get to a town, grab a shower and some food. Most of the time you will start to feel better right away, and you will gain some enthusiasm back.Finally, stubbornness. As my mother will tell you, I am the most stubborn son she has, granted I am the only son, but that is beside the point. When I get something in my head, I am the type of person who will do everything I can to make sure I see it through. I don't like to look foolish, and I plan to use that trait to help drive me through this trip. On average 70% of the people who attempt this hike fail.

Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552700,"Walking the entire Appalachian Trail is the same as climbing Mt Everest 16 times.   Let that sink in for a moment. This will be a physical challenge to say the least.   Proper preparation is going to be key to ensure my body up to the task. Since there aren't any mountains in Iowa, and we are approaching winter, this makes my preparation even more difficult.With my pack loaded to 33 lbs, (8 lbs more than I expect to carry on the trail) I have been spending my weekends, weather permitting, putting in between 10-15 miles.   Its important for my feet to get use to walking with the extra weight. It helps strengthen the ligaments and muscles around the feet as well as toughen them up to help prevent blisters. Having blisters on the trail will make the hiking miserable, and anything I can do to prepare my feet to avoid them I will. One preventive measure I will use are injinji sock liners. These sock liners, have individual toes separated, preventing them from rubbing each other, and minimizing the potential for blistering. Another preventive measure is to rub my feet with rubbing alcohol and witch hazel.   I haven't started doing this yet, but it is suppose to help toughen up the skin on the feet, I guess we will see. In addition to hiking long distances, I have also started training for climbing. To prepare for this, I have been using the Five Seasons center parking ramp stairs. There are 9 floors in this parking ramp, a total of 138 steps.   I started with 5 sets of these stairs and each week have been increasing the sets by 1.   Each set is roughly 80 Ft of climb. Considering before you even reach the southern terminus of the Appalachian trail, you have to climb 602 stairs at the Amicalola Falls approach trail.With Winter upon us, I have also started hitting the gym, yes with full pack on.   Utilizing the treadmills incline, I work my way between a low incline to the highest the treadmill will go.   This is a very different experience from the flat long miles and the weekly stairs. Although there is no way to duplicate my hike before I leave in March, I am hoping that these methods will minimize the training curve I will experience on the trail.   The sooner I get my trail legs the better experience I will have on the trail.",,Physical Training,"Dec 27, Tue",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553138,"Here I am early into the new year, waiting.... This is probably the hardest part of my decision so far.   Luckily the winter has been cold, so Ice fishing takes up most of my weekends.   However Ice fishing is also causing me to procrastinate the final things I need to do in order to sell my house.   I haven't listed my house yet, I am waiting for a couple of things to finalize before I list it.   In the mean time, there are things I could be doing, and have been doing to get it ready, just at a much slower rate than I probably should. As long as my house is sold before mid April I will be fine, ideally I want it sold in March, and as soon as its sold I will able to leave. So waiting does come with some anxiety...I am also waiting to put my pack back on.... The last month or so I have been having some soreness in my neck/left deltoid. I don't think its due to carrying my pack, I had hiked many times with my pack prior without issue.   Either way I thought it would be best to leave the pack out of my workouts until this passes.   Well 4 weeks have passed and my neck is still sore. I started to see a chiropractor, and that is slowly helping. This soreness won't prevent me from making my trip, but if its still occurring, it will add a challenge.Finally I am waiting to get started....Deciding to do this trip has provided me with excitement. I know this is not going to be easy, but I also know this trip will have an impact on me. In a way to pass the time, I have been reading as many books and stories from past thru-hikers as I can. With out question every single one of them said this hike changed them, weather they were looking for it or not.   I wouldn't say I am looking to change who I am, but I am open to the idea of change. Especially mentally. I am the type of person who is constantly thinking, my brain doesn't have a off switch. Usually I do my best thinking while I am sleeping, which is probably why I only need 4-6 hours of sleep to function. Making this trip will give me 6 months of time, to shut down my brain, even for a little time.   This is something I am looking forward to. Any additional changes that occur on this trip will be welcomed, I am always trying to better myself in one way or another.    So I wait...",,The Waiting Game,"Jan 10, Tue",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554673,"When I started this process, I set a goal of leaving for my trip my the end of March. Reaching that date is going to be tough, but not impossible yet.   My house went on the market on Feb 1, selling it is my only remaining loose end that is preventing me from hitting my goal departure date. I know that I cut it close by waiting till Feb to put it on the market, knowing that it could take up to 6 weeks to close once the offer is accepted.   That means I would need to have an offer by about Feb 15 just to be sure I have enough time. Learning to be flexible with your plans is a skill that is needed on the trail, and by the looks of it before you hit the trail. Considering I haven't had any offers on the house yet, I know its only been 15 days, I will need to start thinking of my back up plans.   I still plan on doing the hike, its just a matter of when and how.So my adjustments options are;1. Still do my northbound hike from Springer Mountain, just start a little later. In theory this is still my main goal, I should be able to start as late as April 30th, and make it to Katahdin by Oct 15.   They say it takes an average of 6 months, but if you do the math, to hike 2200 miles at a pace of 15 miles per day, you only need 4.9 months to complete it. So there is plenty of time to still make it, just less times for breaks.   Worst case, If I feel that I am not going to make it by Oct 15th, I can jump ahead to hike the Baxter State Park Section before it closes and then finish the remaining miles after. 2. If my house doesn't sell by April 30th, my next option is to switch to a Flip Flop Hike, ironically, that was my plan when I first decided to do this hike. Flip Flop means I would start in the middle of the trail, hike north to Katahdin and then come back and hike south to Springer Mountain. Typically this type of hike can be started much later, until the end of May, and you get the benefit of seeing the fall colors in the south. The down side to this is you lose the ability to use Katahdin as you finish focal point. Not that Springer is a bad finish point, but it doesn't have the same feeling as Katadin. This is my back-up plan.My neck is still giving me problems. I have been going to the chiropractor, with some relief, but it doesn't seem to be healing. Based on those visits, we have actually determined its probably a tendon, that runs from my shoulder blade to my neck and not my neck that is the problem.   So after a couple of months of pain and no real fix, I did go to the doctor this week. We are going to try some Prednisone, and muscle relaxers for a week to see if that will help, if not it will off to get an MRI.   This injury will not stop me from doing my hike. It will be painful to hike with it, but the way I see it, I am going to be sore all over, this will just be an additional pain.Those are my last two loose ends I need to tie down. The house one is my biggest concern, I was expecting, based on the current market, to see more interest in my house, I have seen some, but not as much as I want. Its probably more about me having high expectations, and me learning to be more flexible with my plans.",,Pressure to lock down last loose ends,"Feb 16, Thu",0

Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556259,"I have a history of taking crazy trips on a moments notice before.   I once drove 1600 miles in the span of 4 days to watch Iowa play basketball in Missouri, spend Thanksgiving with a friend in Oxford, then we road tripped up to Chicago to watch Iowa play basketball again. So it wasn't a surprise to my friends, that I told, that I decided to leave work Friday night and drive 800 miles to Boulder to do a hike. I have been spending a lot of time following fellow AT hikers videos and photos. Everyday I am stuck here, trying to sell my house so I can leave is truly annoying. Hopefully I am close to selling it and will be on my way soon.   So early last week I was looking at the weather for the upcoming weekend to see if I would be able to do some hiking around town, or riding my bike...well, winter decided it wasn't done with us yet.   I had to double check the forecast, 25 degrees for the high....what the.   Last week we were int he 70's, but that is happens in spring time in Iowa.   On a whim, I took a look at the weather forecast in Denver.   To my surprise, it said 70 degrees for the High.   That got me thinking, maybe I could do a quick trip out there and hike some....well my thinking turn into a plan, which turn into a trip..a very quick trip.I dropped Saydee (my doberman) off at my friend Brandons (Who is watching her when I hike the AT), and took Asher (the chin/schnauzer mix) with me for the 12 hour drive. Asher is a much better hiker and for the trail I was going to do, he would really enjoy it...a little too much as I found out later.We left Friday night after work around 5PM.   Asher loves riding in the truck, but I don't think he realized how long we would be riding for. My intention was to drive through the night and get there first thing in the morning. By the time 8 PM came, I started getting tired and talked myself into getting a hotel and finished the drive in the morning. My logic was simple, Its still going to be chilly in the morning, and I will want to hike in the afternoon.   In addition they were projecting snow just past Lincoln, and I would prefer to drive in the day time in snow.So Asher and I got a room at a Super 8 in Lincoln, Nebraska. We didn't need anything fancy, just somewhere to sleep. Turns out they only had smoking rooms left, and for those who don't smoke, like me, the smell is the most awful thing in the world. Added to the fact that this was Asher's first stay in a hotel, he heard every noise, which prompted me to make him sleep next to me and my phone with white noise playing on loud. The next morning we were up early and on our way. We arrived at the start of National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder around 1 PM, perfect timing. This is the start of Bear Peak Mountain trails, a trail I have peaked twice before, without a pack and dog. The trail to the peak is about 3.5 miles up, and 4 miles down. You climb a little over 3000 feet on the way up. The trail is very popular and if you are ever in Boulder, I highly recommend it.We parked in the parking lot and immediately had two problems. First, the temperature was no where near 70, it was 42 degrees, which meant it would be very cold the higher up we went.   Added that I didn't bring a coat for Asher. Second problem, the mountain was fogged in, which normally wouldn't be an issue, but I really didn't feel like taking a dog on a trail in the fog and cold. So we decided to hike the lower trails, not as long, but still some good climbs that would let me see how in shape my legs were.Once we started on the Mesa trail, that's when we ran into problem number 3....there are lots of new smells in Boulder. Asher was in heaven...and stopping every 10 feet to smell. So I didn't really plan this out very well, but Asher was loving it.   He got to see some deer for the first time up close, and so many people were passing by. Needless to say we hike about 2 miles total, and about 1000 feet of total climb and decent. One other noteworthy item, I decided not to take my trekking poles off my pack to use on such a short hike. I didn't think it would matter. By the time we reach the truck, I could tell we had done some hiking that my body (legs) weren't use to and couldn't duplicate in Iowa.   I wasn't sore, but when I went to untie my shoes, my legs were shaking, the kind of shaking you get after a tough leg day at the gym. Just enough to remind me that the AT hike will be tough in the beginning and to make sure I don't over push myself for the first week or two. The good news is there was no soreness the next day.The original plan was to camp in Colorado and head home Sunday morning. Since the weather was not a nice as I hoped, after our hike, we decided to start our trip back, 12 more hours in the car. We did stop again in Council Bluffs to stay at another hotel...a non smoking room.   And arrived back home around noon.

Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558124,"The last two months have been very stressful. I had a grand plan to put my house on the market at the start of February with the expectation that it would sell fairly quickly. If I cold sell it by the end of Feb, I could hit the trail at or near the beginning of April....at least that was what I thought. As February passed, the number of showings was ok, but not great. Based on the feedback, I did some painting, and lowered my asking price (I knew my starting price would be on the high end).   Well the end of February came, and no offers....We thought maybe the weather was having and impact and surely March would be better.   In terms of showings, March was much better, had many more showings but still weren't getting any offers. As we approached the end of March, the fear of not selling my house in time to make a trip this year started setting in.   My realtor and I had discussion about lowing the price again, which based on my research of similar houses sold in the last 6 months, wasn't necessary. I just had to come to the realization that maybe this wasn't going to happen this year.   I had just had a meeting with my work to push back my last day to a non definitive date and was beginning to plan out what I wanted to do this summer if I wasn't hiking.Finally, after what felt like 50 showings, we received an offer yesterday. After a quick counter, they accepted and would like to take possession on April 28th.   Which makes my start date May 1st or April 30th depending on when I leave from home.I am still going to do a Northbound trek, and if I get to a point where I feel I need to jump ahead to reach MT.

Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560279,"As my departure date approaches, there is a debate that has been raging in my mind over the last week. Do I want to hike a late NOBO or Flip Flop starting in Harpers Ferry. Luckily I can wait until the day I get my rental car to decide.So in typical analytical fashion here is a breakdown of the positives and negatives of each.LATE NOBOPositives: 1. Single ending point of Mt Katahdin.   This allows you to focus on one primary goal with out any lapse in hiking.2. Trail is less crowded. Less of a chance of getting Norovirus, which has been going around. Also more opportunity to have less of an impact on the environment and plenty of space in shelters.3. With my limited time to complete my hike, I will need to justify any Zero days I take. Which will keep me from staying too long in a town. That will also prevent me from spending extra money in the towns.   Negatives: 1. Its going to be hot and humid. Leaving from Georgia in May means I will be hiking north as the weather starts to get humid and much hotter during the day.   Being from Iowa and having lived in Florida, I know exactly what I will be getting into. 2. Less trail magic provided. Most of the trail magic will be targeted for the bubbles, so there will probably be less opportunity to receive any.3. My time is limited. I will have about 5.5 months to complete the hike, which doesn't concern me. It means that I will need to average just over 13 miles per day to complete my trip. 4. Less Zero days. Because of my time limit, each time I take a day off, I will be reminded that I just added 13 miles that will need to be recovered in my remaining days.",,The Debate (In My Mind) Continues Pt. 1,"Apr 16, Sun",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560288,"Positives and Negatives of doing a Flip Flop (Starting in Harpers Ferry)Positives1. I don't have a time limit. One of the benefits I have is that I quit my job and sold my house. This frees me up to spend as much time as I want doing this trip....as long as my money holds out, which it will.2. Better weather for the entire trip. I am sure there will be hot days, but for the most part I am hitting spring to early summer temperatures instead of late summer.3. Still having less of an impact on the environment, as I will be ahead of the bubble.4. Should see more trail magic than a late NOBO trip.5. Can take a break between summiting Katahdin and starting back at Harpers Ferry.6. Get to spend the fall in the Smokies and see the colors from the leaves changing.7. Starting with fairly easy hiking to build up my hiker legs.Negatives1. Don't have a focal point for finishing.   My biggest concern about doing a flip flop is summiting Katahdin, and then not being motivated to finish the other half. Typically hikers take a month off between summiting Katahdin and starting the South Bound hike.2. Will probably miss all of Iowa football Season. By doing a Flip Flop, I will probably finish sometime in November. This would put me at the end of the season for seeing any Iowa games.3. Get to see the Pennsylvania rocks much sooner. Pennsylvania is notorious for their rocks, which make turning an ankle very easy. I fully expect to turn an ankle or two in Pennsylvania.In the end, no matter what I choose, its about the trip and my goal is not to plan anything during my time and see what happens.   Until then, the debate will continue in my head.   We will find out April 29 or 30th, depending on how drunk I get playing in my only volleyball tournament of the year.",,The Debate (In My Mind) Continues Pt. 2,"Apr 16, Sun",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563204,"Before I was able to start my hike, I needed to find a way to reach West Virginia.  I was able to find and Enterprise only 6 miles away from where I needed to go to start my Hike, The Appalachian Trial Conservancy.   So I went to check out the rates, for a 2 day rental, they wanted to charge over $700.  I thought for sure this was a mistake, so I gave the reservation line a call.   NOPE, apparently there was a $450 drop off fee for not returning the car to an airport.  No way was I paying that amount so I looked for another rental in the nearest town of Martinsburg, WV.   I was able to rent a car from Hertz for about $171, only one problem, I was now about 16 miles away from my start.   Although concerned, my mantra for this trip has been, ""in no hurry, got no plan"".   I know its a double negative, so English majors can't F-off. :)

Now that I knew I had my ride and my departure date, April 30th, I needed to find a place to stay.  Knowing I was starting in the middle of civil war country, I thought it would be a great idea to find a old bed and breakfast to stay in.  I had never stayed at a bed and breakfast before, so this was getting two birds with one stone.  I was able to find the Carriage Inn, in Charlestown.  It was built in the 1800, and had great history of use in the civil war.   I am not going to into detail, as this is a hiking journal, but you should check it out, very interesting. 
After my night stay at the Carriage Inn, I took my rental car to Martinsburg, sure I would find a ride to the ATC.  Martinsburg had have Uber, Lyft, or a Cab company.  When I dropped off the car, I asked what would be the best way to get back to Harper's Ferry.  The gentleman said, cab was going to be too expensive, and there was an Uber in the area but he didn't know if he still did it.  So I downloaded Uber, new phone didn't have it yet.   Request a ride, and found one right away about 15 minutes away.  Shortly after the request, I got a call from the Uber driver, asking me where I was going.  I told him the ATC in Harper's Ferry, his response was ""I can't come get you and take you there"".  WTF.  Nothing I could do, so I talked to the rental car person again, he didn't have any other ideas, so my next step was to look at the ATC website for the list of people who assist hikers.   Luckily I found ""Trail Boss"", he works for the ATC and takes care of many of the trails.   He said he had never picked anyone up in Martinsburg before and didn't know there was a Hertz there, but he would be right out.   First trail angel.......  After he picked my up we discussed my flip flop hike, he mentioned staying at Ed Garvey because the next shelter was older and not as nice.  So 6.9 miles it was for my first day.
We reached the ATC in Harper's Ferry, I checked in and got my picture taken, if you aren't following me on Instagram, that is where all my pics are being posted.  You can find me under scottsteffes.   After hitting the restroom, I was off, pretty simple follow the blue blazes to the trail, then follow the white blazes.   Blazes are 6 inch markers painted on posts and trees to let you know where to go.   Well it didn't take me but 2 streets to get off trail and miss the turn on the blue blazes.  Somebody forgot that a double blaze means the trail is turning.  After about 5 minutes, I figured it out and was on my way.  .2 miles to the trail from the ATC, mostly down hill.  I stopped and took some pictures, as Harper's Ferry is a beautiful town.  I finally reached the actual trail, and the first thing you do is cross over from West Virginia to Maryland.  There is a footbridge that takes you across the Potomac River into Maryland.  
After the footbridge, You the trail was pebble rocks and flat for a couple of miles, moving along the river, and it was extremely easy.  Then you reach Weverton Road.  Weverton Rd sits at 371 feet and only 2.8 miles for the Ed Garvey Shelter.   This is the point when shit got real.  The next 2.8 miles took me to 1083 feet, which in reality isn't a lot, I will do 700 ft climbs without issue later, but for a guy who is not in hiking shape, and is not use to 78 degree weather, this was a struggle.  I took 5 breaks to reach the shelter, huffing and puffing the whole way.  Once I reached the shelter, there was a female there, her name was Sarah, and she said another gentleman from Australia was getting water.  His name was Dave.  These are two of the 5 people I would spend the next 3 nights camping with.  
After catching my breath, I was out of water and had to go down the trail to find the spring.   I dropped my backpack, grabbed my water filter and bottles and headed down.  The spring was .4 miles down a steep hill as the guide book stated.  What the guide book didn't tell you is that you would probably drink all your water on the way back up.   One thing to remember .4 miles to anything really means .8 miles as you have to come back.  So as I start down the trail, pack-less, thinking this is easy without a pack, I meet Dave, who is on his way up, he is huffing and puffing, which makes me realize this is going to suck to walk up carrying 6 pounds of water.   So I get to the spring, fill my bladder and filter some water.  I am still thirsty from the first climb so I guzzled down a liter of water and then filled up my bottles and the bladder again.  So with 6 liters of water I start the climb of hell.  This was tougher than the climb from Weverton Rd.  I was crushed by this climb.   
Finally I made it up the hill, and got to know the others in the shelter.  We had a couple of section hikers from Michigan show up, Pambi and Mad Tom.  We had two other groups show up and set up tents on the two camp sites.  One group didn't talk to us, but did have an ax with them, so we were pretty sure they were not thru hiking.   No way a thru hiker would carry an ax.   The other group was some college buddies who do a week of camping together each year.  At this point I was still not cooling off, and had a horrible headache, so I decided to lay down in my tent I had set up early, where the college kids decided to set up.  I didn't even feel like eating, so I took two Excedrin and just laid there trying to cool off.
We knew rain was on its way so most of the thru hikers were in the shelter.  Neal, and Bob showed up later, I didn't have much conversation with them, Neal is section hiking and Bob is also Flip Flop Thru Hiking.  Eventually I was able to cool down enough to fall asleep, not caring that the college kids were making noise.....or that they had steaks and gave some to Dan, another section hiker who came in later.   Overall first day was a success.","ATC in Harpers Ferry, WV

About a mile from the campsite, I had to stop to put on my fleece.  I was on a ridge, and the temperature was around 52 degrees, with a good wind blowing.   Since I was the first in camp, I started a fire for the group.  At this point, it was only the five of us staying at Pogi.   Sarah, Dave, and I put our tents and Dave's hammock near the fire, Neal and Bob put their tents up higher in the campsite. 
Knowing my issue with the sodium intake, I decided that I would eat my taters and Spam earlier, so I decided to cook about 1 PM, and I would just snack the rest of the night.  The thought was, this would keep me from swelling again tomorrow.  
As I was setting up my sleeping pad, my therm-a-rest decided to blow a gasket.  The stitching inside the pad came apart, causing a giant bubble in the middle of the pad.  It was about 8 inches wide and looked like lumbar support.  Luckily I had decided to switch to a mat instead of a pad the first chance I got.  I wanted a wider pad to accommodate my stomach sleeping style.  I contacted Therm-a-rest, and they offered to send me a new pad to the next town, since I was already switching, I had them send it home, and I will resell it when I get back.   I was able to use the pad the sleep on, I deflated it a bit so the lumbar bubble didn't affect me.  These pads are critical on the AT, because they are designed to trap your body heat and keep you warm at night, so blowing a gasket like that, could have affected the warmth of the pad.  
Ironically, it was going to be the coldest night so far.  The low was going to be 45 degrees.  During the day, the temperature fluctuated depending on if you were in the sun or not.  Once the sun went down, it was bone chilling cold.  We were all in our tents by then, I was watching a movie on my phone, my tent has a mesh holding pocket right above my head, perfect to hold my phone and me to lay and watch movies.   We were all nice and warm in our tents.  Having ate my high sodium earlier was paying off....except I had to pee.   So the first time I got out to pee, in my tee-shirt and shorts, I was shaking so bad from the cold, I about peed on myself.  I got back to my tent, I threw on my light thermal pants, and fleece.   About an hour later I had to pee again, same result.  That's when I decided to stay warm and cozy in my tent the rest of the night.","Dahlgren Campsite

Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563246,"I did not want to get out of my tent after the bone chilling peeing experience the night before.   Once I did get out of the tent, after 2 hours of laying there, it wasn't too bad out.  I had to wear my fleece, but wasn't as cold as I expected.  
We had been watching the weather the last couple of days, and knew there was a severe storm headed our way Thursday night and Friday morning.  It was 9.9 miles to the Raven Rock Shelter, or 14.5 miles to a county park where we could get a ride into Waynesboro, PA.  The plan was to see how we felt and decide from there.  
The hiking today was pretty easy to Raven Rock, there was some of the famous Pennsylvania rocks for a couple of stretches.  If you want to see what I mean, google ""Appalachian Trail Pennsylvania Rocks"".   I actually enjoyed the rock hopping, as long as it was on level ground, climbing or descending was a different story.  I was able to make it the Raven Rock by 12:30, again the first one to the shelter, not because I am a fast hiker, just because I leave first each morning.
Raven Rock is the nicest shelter I have seen on the trail.  It is two tiers, with varnished floors and walls, and a very nice cable bear bag hang.  The only flaw was the tin roof, which would make for a loud night if it was raining.
After the hike from Pogi to Raven Rock, I felt pretty good, I took my shoes off and was waiting for Sarah to arrive to see if she wanted to hike the extra miles to get in town before the storm.   She arrived and mentioned that her parents my come and get her to take her home for the night.  She if from Maryland, and only an hour from where we were headed.   So we decided to trek the 4.6 miles to Pen Mar County Park.
The hike started out great, then we hit the rocks on the descent.  We had about 2 miles of hiking through the rocks as we were descending.  These rocks are dangerous and can easily grab an ankle or trekking pole and send you flying.  We took our time, as painful as it was, and about half way down, stopped to talk to some high school students making their way up the trail.  Sarah told them they were almost to the top (a lie, to make them feel good), and they had questions about our hike.   
We continued down the trail, finally reaching the park, as Sarah tells me the story about her ""kidnapping"" a guy at this park.  Apparently he was looking for the Mason Dixon line sign and she talked him into her car, only to find out he was just turned around and didn't need to go anywhere.  Once at the park, Sarah decided she was going to go home, and I decided to get a room at the Burgundy B&B.  They would pick me up and drop me off at the trail, and do my laundry.  Plus when I called about the rooms, the only one they had was the one with the Jacuzzi.  I jump on it like a fat kid on a cupcake.
Sarah had to wait for her parents to come from an hour away, so we decide to try to order some pizza to the park.   Rocky's Pizza was 1.7 miles away so I called to see if they would deliver....they do!  So I ordered a large stuffed meat lovers pizza and some cheesy garlic bread.   When the delivery guy arrived, he said ""I hope there is more than two of you eating this"".  Apparently my eyes are bigger than my stomach at this point.  We ate a total of 3.5 pieces of this pizza...but we did finish the cheesy garlic bread.
Once we were done eating, I had scheduled my ride from the B&B to come get me at 7:30, because Sarah's Parents weren't coming til later, and knowing the kidnapping history of the park, I thought it would be best to wait, or if you know me, it just something I would do.   So while were were freezing waiting for her parents, her mom called to say they were on their way, and if I wanted to wait for a ride she would have beer.   Again if you know me, you know I don't drink beer, but in this case if her mom was going to bring it, I would suffer.  Eventually, Sarah told me to just leave and she would be fine, so I called for my ride to the B&B, leaving Sarah, hoping she didn't kidnap another person.
Once at the B&B I was all about my Jacuzzi, I sat in that thing for about an hour, with the jets right on my feet....boy what a feeling.","Pogo Campsite

Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563248,"Took a zero day today, only walking was in Walmart to resupply and down to Frank's for some food and drink with Dave. (Teabag).  Was able to send some things home to lighten my pack.  Also was able to update my journal entries and my YouTube videos.  David and Margaret have been great hosts at the B&B.  Unfortunately, they are selling the place and moving to Tennessee.   Overall today was relaxing, and just what I needed to avoid the rain....only it was pretty nice out today after the early morning rains.","Burgundy B&B
",Zero Day at Burgundy B&B in Waynesboro,"May 05, Fri",0
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564311,"Recieved my new sleep pad around 9 AM.  This allowed Tom (Ozzy) who I met at the B&B to get started right after we picked up sandwiches at Wayne's Burger.  Dave (Owner of the Burgundy B&B) drove us back to the park to start around 11 AM.
The point of the zero day was to avoid the rains, apparently there is no avoiding it as the weather called for rain most of the day.
So Tom and I suited up in our rain suits, I am using a zpacks poncho, but since my pack is waterproof, I was able to use my pack belt to keep the poncho from blowing around all day.  For anyone who wants to hike, rain hiking sucks, either you get wet from the rain or you get wet from sweating.  
Less than a mile from our start we hit the Mason Dixon Line, which meant we are starting our second state, Pennsylvania.  
Pennsylvania is know for its Rocky terrain, how ever the first part of the state is less Rocky than the second part.  The plan is to do 15.2 miles to Rocky Mountain Shelter. 
It didn't take long for my shoes and socks to be soaked, which actually felt good on the feet, I didn't notice any hot or sore spots most of the day.  I did have two minor injuries that will linger for the next day's.  First is my big toe on my right foot started to get really sore about 11 miles in.  I am not sure is this is a product of my shoes, how I walk, or that I just sprained it.  So I spent the last 4 miles leaning to walk with the pressure on the other parts of my foot.   This slowed me down dramatically, as I didn't get to the shelter until 7.
My second injury is my left arm started to go numb for portions of the day.  At first I thought it was just out of sync, so I did some stretching trying to loosen it up.  This works the first couple of times, so I thought nothing of it.  
I did get to experience something new today, I visited my first tree.  So many decisions go into yur first visit, where is a place hidden enough to bare all, and what position do you choose.   I will spare you the details, but did make another decision, I took of my rain gear and pant legs.  I was already wet, and the rain was slowing down.  This little break, separated Ozzy and I, but we planned to meet up at the shelter. 
We did run into another hiker today that Ozzy had met before.  Chickadee, started in Georgia and was hoping to make it to Massachusetts by the end of the month.  He doesn't hike with trekking poles and is using an older backpack.  You can, however, tell he is a strong hiker as he flew by Ozzy and I.
The hiking was pretty easy today, the most difficult part was hiking to the shelter from the trail, we had to go .3 miles down.  And to get water was another .2 miles. 
Once I got to the shelter, Ozzy wasn't there, and neither were any of the others from my group.  I was planning on meeting them at the shelter as well.  Turns out Ozzy noticed the hike down and decided to push on, he had already done 20 miles days before.  The rest of the group came to the shelter and saw it was wet and the wind was blowing in the front, so the decided to hike 4 more miles to stay at the Trail of Hope Hostel.  So I decided to stealth camp on the flattest part I could find.
It was going to get cold at night so I had some of the sandwich I packed out and went to my tent to test my new sleep pad.  As I was laying there a couple came to the sheeter with a 11 month old husky.  I had to come out of my tent to see, but didn't get out.  They apologized for waking, which they didn't, and I suggested the camp sites by the water source were probably the best.  After that, Chickadee offered to go get me water as he was headed down, I declined and hit the sack.  
 One thing that sucks is with the nights being cold, there isn't much socializing after about 8:30.  Everyone heads for warmth of there bags.  I did hear a couple of other people come to the shelter, but I was too warm to get out and look.","Pen Mar Park
",Rocky Mountain Shelter,"May 06, Sat",15.20
Scott Steffes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564344,"Got started early on the trail, it was a chilly morning, but my new pad did great for keeping me warm.  Next time I will have to do a better job of picking my tent site.  New pad doesn't block out the tree roots and rocks as well as my last pad.
The plan was to get in 13 miles to the Birch Run Shelter.  At this point I don't know where everyone is, so I am just going to hike. 
My first stop was Caledonia State Park, since I didn't want to hike down to the spring at Rocky Mountain Shelter, I was limites on water.  Luckily it was cool and the firsr part of the day was down hill.  I figured when I reached the park I would be able to get water there.   Come to find out the only water was at the ranger house, which was almost .5 miles, and at this point walking a mile just for water, isn't worth it.   
At the park I took a break to eat some breakfast and check my phone.  Sarah had text me and let me know, her, Neal, and , Bob had stayed at the hope hostel and wouldn't be leaving until 11, after the rain had stopped.   It was a little after 7 AM, so I told her I would meet them at Birch Run Shelter.
I also received a message from Ozzy, he was at Quarry Gap Shelter.   That was about 3 miles from me, and I let him know I would be there in about an hour or so.  The climb to Quarry Gap is a good one, I had to take a couple of breaks, and watch my water supply.  
As I was almost to the top of the hill, Chickadee caught up with me.  We hiked together until we reached the shelter.  He had to complete his trip by June so he can go back to work.  He is planning on college in the fall.  
We arrived at Quarry Gap Shelter, which is one of the nicest shelters on the trail.  The water source is about 10 feet from the shelter, and they have some platforms for tents.  On one of those platforms was Ozzy.  As he made his way out of the tent, I noticed him hobbling and blood on his pants.  Ozzy is 61, and has lots of energy.  He out hikes me easily.  So, the night before, Ozzy said he wasnt paying attention and tripped on some big rocks, as he did, his leg caught and twisted his knee a bit.  As he caught himself, he sliced open his hand as well.  He was obviously in pain, and the knee was giving him problems.  While at Quarry Gap Shelter, I met Hank, and his Golden Retriever, Brody.  Hank is from Tennessee and they are also doing a flip flop.  I spent plenty of time petting Brody.   In addition we saw two more little dogs with some day hikers.   Seems that part of the trail is popular for day hikers and runners...yes I saw a women running up the trail from the park.  She must be crazy.After a break and some food I decided to take off for Birch Run.   Ozzy was ahead of me, but I quickly passed him as he was trying to set up his podcasts.  Later Ozzy caught me, and we hiked the rest of the way to Birch Run together.  I filled him in on the call center world.At Birch Run, we met Peanut, who is a Nobo.  She started the trail with a enormous amount of peanuts, and had to eventually give them away.  She was living in the Czech Republic and had come over to hike the trail before law school in Boston.  She is America, parents moved 10 years ago.  We talked for a while, when she informed me that cous cous will soften with cold water in about 5 min.  This was great, now I can send my stove home and eat cold cous cous.  First though I had to use the gas I had and finish the block of butter I packed out for my cous cous.Ozzy decided he was going to o head on, and we would meet up in Boiling Springs, for a beer.  While I waited for Sarah, Bob, and Neil, several other hikers came through with dogs.   Hank and Brody, they pushed on.  Lilo, who was full of energy and looked like a jack russel mix of some sort.  Finally Mimah, the 11 month old husky I saw the other night.  All of them pushed on to.other locations.After about a hour, Sarah, Bob, and Neal arrived. It was supposed to be another cold night, so everyone was in their tents early.  I didn't have cell service, so I tried to watch a movie on my phone but fell asleep.  Only issue was, I didn't hit the trees before I fell a sleep, and so at about 2 am, I had to pee.  I fought it for a while, knowing it was cold out.  Finally get out at 4 AM, so I could sleep again.","Rocky Mountain Shelter
