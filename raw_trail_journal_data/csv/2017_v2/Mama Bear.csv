Mama Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539525,"Last week I had a epiphany.Over the years I have got so wrapped-up in life. I forgot what I loved about it. I started a AT thru-hike 3/29/02. I twisted my knee on the north side of blood Mt. But pushed on to Bryson City NC but the pain was too much. I ended up having surgery. After I recovered I hiked every chance I got.Then over the years I would find less and less time. Now I find my self down to one or two day trips a year. Not making it to Main is one of my biggest regrets in like. Now at 41, over weight,and out of shape. I'm making preparations to leave my spouse of 13 years and two children (will be 6 & 9) for ~three months to fulfill a life long dream.",,A shot at redemption.,"Jun 24, Fri",0
