Tang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477876,"I am following the advice contained in one of the many AT Thru-Hike memoirs I've read, which is to make it real by making it public. I am committed, and by committing I feel I have taken the first step on this journey!",,It's real.,"Nov 05, Wed",0
Tang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477877,"There is one clear and distinct reason I have been able to commit to this journey. I have been gripped by this dream for some time now. But I had found myself alternating between a desire to commit and start planning, and a nagging feeling that I should give up such a selfish quest. But I finally put the question directly to my wife, ""Would you be OK if I were to be away for 5 or 6 months to do this?"" She did not hesitate in responding, ""I'll be fine. I don't think anyone has the right to stand in the way of someone else's dream."" I am a lucky man.",,Thank you.,"Nov 05, Wed",0
Tang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477878,"I'm not sure if this is the best forum for questions like this. I know journals are mostly for sharing information, not soliciting it. But I would like to know people's thoughts about hammocks instead of tents for hiking the AT. If you have any experience or knowledge about the pros and cons, I'd appreciate hearing from you.",,What about hanging?,"Nov 05, Wed",0
Tang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517530,"I've gotten onto the AMC CT mailing list, and appreciate what the organization is doing. Decided to give them a day of service. Spent it refreshing boundary markers that separate state, federal, and private property along the AT in northwest CT. I never knew I could drive for that long and still be in CT!! Met nice folks, and had a great day bushwhacking.",,Volunteering in CT,"Jul 22, Wed",0
Tang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517535,"I accepted an invitation from some friends who planned to hike Katahdin this summer. What a great time. I am HOOKED!! 
I have uploaded about a dozen photos of this hike, dated 07/27 on my ""photos"" page.",,Katahdin summit,"Jul 27, Mon",0
Tang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517536,"I have committed to a thru-hike of the Long Trail next summer, largely on the advice of my plumber, Brother Buzz. (Check out his AT thru-hike journal.) He convinced me that the LT would be a great way to fine-tune my gear and shorten my learning curve before setting out from Springer Mtn. on my 62nd birthday, (March 28, 2017).",,View Entry,"Oct 28, Wed",0
