Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557598,Been going to Swallow Cliffs every weekend to do the stairs. I thought I had an original idea but ran into someone on the trail who saw me hiking with backpack on and using trekking poles and commented that I must be training for some thing. Turned out that he had done the AT a couple years earlier. Also turned out that he had written a book about his hike called The Green Tunnel.,,View Entry,"Feb 19, Sun",0
Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558202,"This was our last practice hike this time with the gear we expect to be carrying on AT. The packs did not seem too heavy but we were on flat ground the whole time. Sharon will be joining me on the hike for the first four days and Joe, a relative from Atlanta, will join us for a day hike of the approach trail. We will be able to go packless for the approach. Hopefully that will help our legs adjust especially since we won't be on flat ground anymore. While our hiking weather on Sunday looks good, day two appears to have thunderstorms in the forecast. Not exactly how I wanted to start out.",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Wed",0
Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558861,"Sharon and I did the approach trail today joined by Joe and Anton cousins from Atlanta. We parked Joe's car at the Springer Mountain parking lot at the end of a 6.5 mile curving dirt road and then went back to Amicalola Falls to start the approach trail. Thank you to Norm and Nancy, Sharon's parents, for the long drive from Atlanta to get us to the start. The approach trail 8.8 miles mostly uphill. It was then another mile to get to Joe's car where we picked up our backpacks and hiked another 1.8 to Stover Creek Shelter. There must have been about 50 hikers already their. Storms are due to come thru tomorrow so not really looking forward that hike. Total miles for the day was 11.6 but only 2.8 was on the official AT","Amicalola Falls State Park

So did not start hiking til about 10:30. Then it was about 4 hours (3.5miles) of hiking in the rain, with maybe 30 minutes of thunderstorms. Stopped at Hawk Mountain shelter 5.3 miles in to get a little break from the rain and to eat lunch. The shelter was full from hikers calling it a day. We left there around 2:00 and hiked another 6.5 where we found a campsite and called it a night knowing we would not make our goal before sunset. I told Sharon her trail name should be pacesetter as she was always way out ahead of me. At Hawk Mountain she had taken some of the gear from my pack. I had been having some hip pains. After easing my load a bit and re-adjusting the straps of my pack I did much better.","Stover Creek Shelter

Made a lunch stop at Gooch Mountain Shelter about 2.2 miles into the day. Met Pete and Sue, local trail volunteers who would be there for a few days. We spent a little more time there than planned. Another 1.4 miles to snack break at Gooch Gap and again at Cooper Gap where we met someone from Lagrange Park about five miles from our home.We had a few steep uphills today but I was not feeling as much pain as yesterday. The uphills did lead to some nice views especially from Ramrock Mountain.The end of the day got us to Woody Gap where someone told us we just missed trail angels serving hot dogs and brownies. Luckily the group that included the Pat from Lagrange Park knew we were close behind and saved us some.We had planned on camping there where Sharon's parents were going to pick us up but there was another storm due in early so we got a shuttle into Suches, GA where we stayed in a cabin At a biker campground called Two Wheels of Suches. We were the only ones there. We went across the street to get a six pack and sat outside on the deck of the Two Wheel and cooked our dinner. I was great to have a beer and a bed.","Campsite short of Justus Creek

I was first one here as most guests are actually coming in from airport and then will start trail tomorrow.My pack is still pretty heavy from too much food so tried to pig out a bit today. When Norm & Nancy picked up Sharon this morning they also gave me a resupply of food but we had not yet worked down our supply from the last three daysI repacked some of the food into zip locks to get rid of the bulky boxes and out of habit thought of where outside to use the backpacker stove as I'm sitting in a chair looking at the kitchen that is at my disposal.I Enjoyed talking with other hikers in the hostel from Philadelphia, Boston, England and McHenry ,Il. Mostly women staying in the shelter. Rain had let up earlier today but as I am typing this at 9:45 it just started pouring again. Glad to be off the trail today.","Woody Gap

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559600,"Besides avoiding two waves of storms getting off the trail for a day did wonders for my legs. I had asked at the Hostel if they had any bunks available for the next night as there was still rain likely today but the y did not. When I mentioned that to Caroline when I spoke to her yesterday she said ""two day off after only hiking three? That's pretty sad""There was no rain on the trail as that was the forecast for the lower elevation town. I hiked up to Blood Mountain and got sleet and snow instead. Actually it was pretty light but it was the wind that was the killer. It did keep me moving though since there was no place I wanted to take a break. About five miles into the hike I caught up with Red Bull and Vapor, trail name of a couple guys that were hiking together. We talked a bit and then took turns passing each other all the way up to the top Where BloodMountain Shelter is at 8.4 miles into the day. I had been looking forward to a break at Woods Hole Shelter at 7.1 miles but when we got there I saw that is was 0.4 miles off the trail which was too much of a detour. I was so excited to see the road knowing that I could get indoors for a little bit. The Hostel was closed for remodeling their cabins were full and they were suggesting hitching into town for a hotel room for sixty bucks. I decided to brave It at the camp site. Knowing that the winds would not let me start my little stove I bought a frozen pizza that they heated for me at the outfitters and they let me sit inside their store to eat it. Putting the tent up in the heavy winds was a challenge. Later in the night the winds picked up even more. It felt like I was on an Everest expedition. I did not get much sleep that night","Woody Gap

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559599,"Winds were still blowing pretty hard and it was still very cold. I knew that the outfitter opened at 8:00 so I grabbed a pop tart for breakfast and went into the store to get a cup of coffee. I sat down on a bench in the store and had my breakfast.I was not looking forward to taking down my tent in the wind so I climbed back inside. I did not get back on the trail until almost 11:00.    Once I did I felt pretty good. There was a bit of a climb out of Neels Gap but it was gradual. I figured I must have my trail legs already. No need for ibuprofen any more. I kind of like hiking by myself now setting my own pace and stopping without having to yell to my hiking partner who was way ahead of me (so far I have not come across anyone slower than me), but when I reached the beautiful view here to stop for lunch I would have liked to share it with Sharon. Instead I shared it with Tim from Buffalo. There were a couple more scenic views where I ran into Pat from Lagrange Park again. He asked me if I had gotten sick. Apparently there was something going around that somehow I avoided. After enjoying the views for a bit there was a descent down to a parking lot. And then a big ascent back up. This one was very steep with a lot of switchbacks. By the time I got to the top I realized I am not done with the ibuprofen. I stopped at the top to relieve myself of the pack and have some lunch. A short while later an eight year old girl (later I learned her trail name is tough cookie) got to the top with no effort. I asked her who she was with and then I saw her dad (General) appear, taking a little more effort. I hiked with them for bit back down to the road where we got some water and then they went on ahead. I did not make my destination figuring it would be too late when I got there and that it would be crowded so I set up a campsite along the way and called it quits for the day.","Neel Gap

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559611,Last night a woman from Georgia i'm guessing due to her accent was hiking past my campsite after I had everything set up. She said she was headed for Low Gap which was where I was originally trying to get to. I said that she would not have much daylight left and that the site would probably be pretty crowded but she continued on. I wondered if I would see her the next day as she seemed to be moving kind of slow. Sure enough I did see her but only because she was hiking back towards me. She said that she was too cold last night and she was hiking out to the nearest road to go find a better sleeping bag. I felt bad for her that she would have to rehike that section adding almost nine miles to her total hike.It was pretty cold last night which led me to get a late start this morning. I did stop at Low Gap shelter for lunch where I met a couple who has just day hiked in for the weekend. I wound up talking to them for too long and before I knew had stayed almost an hour.I reached Blue Mountain by 5:00 which was nice having plenty of time to set up and still have plenty of time to socialize with others. I met up with General and Tough Cookie again who had made it to Low Gap the previous night. Also met Pumpkin a woman from D.C. And a group of three who were in from N.C. for the weekend. They had built a fire and we all sat around talking for a while. Often times by sunset I am already exhausted and climbing into my tent by sunset.,"Poor Mountain

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559614,"I got an early start this morning for me. I was hiking by a little after nine. I caught up to two women who had left camp a bit earlier than me. I thought that finally I was able to walk faster than someone. They each had a bad knee. We got down to Unicoi Gap where there was some trail magic. One of them was named Plunge Pool who I had met at Neel Gap a few nights earlier. He gave me some sweet tea and some cookies. Then I went over to Tippy -Toes' van and got a doughnut and Coke. Chuckles had brought some Beer, unfortunately it was only 10:30 in the morning and was not ready for a Beer yet. I wound up talking to them for about 45 minutes before starting the hike up Rock Mountain (about an 1100 ft climb) I could not keep up with the two women with bad knees on the way up but did catch them at the bottom at Indian Grave Gap where I learned their names were Meredith- a thru hiker, and Chelsey, a friend joining her to the N.C. border. Meredith was interesting, she had done a lot of traveling in Asia taking odd jobs in bartending and SCUBA instructing in various Asian countries. At the bottom of Indian Grave Gap we had wished that this is where the trail angel with beer was.From here we had a 1300 ft climb to Tray Mountain Shelter. This was a pretty big climb and this turned out to be one of those nights that right after dinner and watching the sunset I was ready to climb into my tent for the night. My back was pretty sore and after popping some Ibupropen and listening to some music I was down for the night. I had not been listening to much music to conserve my battery but I knew I would be recharging tomorrow.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559688,"Another relatively early start around 9:00. I had a longer stretch of lesser climbs in the beginning of the day stopping several times along the way for snack or lunch breaks. My need for water and need to get the backpack off seem to be in sync. I got to one point where the water source was 0.2 miles off the trail so decided that I had enough water to make it 2.7 miles to an easier source of water. Another 0.9 miles down the trail I had stopped for a snack where another hiker had also stopped. He had run out of water and there was a water source 0.5 miles off the trail. I told him I could give him half a liter to make it to the next source. I hated to see him have to make the one mile journey off the trail to get water.The next source was anther 1.8 miles one mile uphill and then another 0.8 down. This was a little less off the trail but it also led to the next Shelter where many people were spending the night but I was continuing on. So I left my pack at the turn off and walked down hill to get water. After talking to others at the water source for a while I headed back to my pack and continued on. From there it was another 3.6 miles. Most of it downhill which was good for me not so much for the two girls who I had caught up to again and the very end of the trail for the day.Along the way I came across a sign indicating a vista that was 0.2 miles off trail. Anxious to end my day I start to continue on but then decided to drop my pack (I needed relief from it any way) and head down to the view. Very glad I did. It had a beautiful view of the valley below with a large lake.I had already prepaid for my stay at the Top of Georgia Hostel, but the 3.6 mile hike beyond the shelter just did not seem to want to ever end. Had i not prepaid the thought of just finding a site along the way crossed my mind many times. Finally getting down to the road the timing was perfect as a Top of GA van had just pulled up.I got to the Hostel where they had a cold soda waiting for me and I ran into John from the Hiker Hostel earlier in the week.They had a scale on their deck where I hung my pack to see it was 45 lbs. After eating 5 days of food that means I was probably up to 50lbs at one point. I will need to send some stuff home.Later on I called Sharon to update her on my day. A woman (Trisha) was walking by and said to say hi to her. She was someone we talked to on the trail when Sharon was hiking with me. Trisha had asked me if I had gotten sick. I put Sharon on speaker and they shared their stories of contacting Norovirus. I won't go into the details.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560083,"Woke up for 7:00 coffee and all you can eat cereal (not as good as the French toast and eggs at Hiker Hostel). During breakfast the owner of the shelter talked about tips on hiking the trail and a talk about the Norovirus that has been going around.I did not go on the scheduled shuttle ride.I asked one of the employees to help me go through my backpack to identify excess weight. We were able to pull out six pounds of stuff to send back home.I also wanted to work on posting to the journal on a their computer rather than my iPhone. I also used the computer to get my Smokey Mountains permit (now that it's paid for I am committed to at least make it to there).People that I had seen from previous days were showing up for tonight's stay including a woman, Shannon from Boston that I had met at the last Hostel several days earlier. When I saw her at the last hostel she had not started the trail yet so I had a 20 mile lead on her. She told me that she had accidentally hiked 17 miles one day. By 1:00 I was ready to hit the trail. I went outside to gather my things to find that my trekking poles were gone. After me and the employees searched everywhere we determined that someone must have taken them hopefully by accident. By then others had been showing up so there were many sets of poles so we could not tell if any of those had been left behind by mistake. So now by 2:00 I was back on the trail with a stick. Actually it's a pretty good stick. Over the past couple of days my left elbow had been aching so I was only using one pole anyway. Hopefully my poles wind up back at the shelter where they would forward them up the trail. Otherwise maybe the stick will make it to Maine with me For the first two hours of my hike that is all that ran through my head. That and the thought that Georgia is in a drought and I'm out of water. Actually I knew that a stream would be coming up before I hit the next campsite. I filled up my water bottles and all was well again. Made into a shelter where there were only eight of us in total compared to 50 at the first place. I met a couple in their 70's, Skip and Linda, that were really interesting. They talked about their trips to Africa and Machu Pichu. They are only hiking for three months how ever far the make it. Skip said that he would be in Rosemont for a sports memorabilia show in July. But hopefully I'll still be on the trail.","Dicks Creek Gap

I caught up to the 70 year old couple on the climb out of the gap. Later on stopping for water I caught up the Tom and Paula (aka Q-Tip). They had also stayed at the same camp site last night. We then took turns passing each other. At 12:35 I crossed into North Carolina. A short while later I took a snack break at a beautiful lookout point and could see way off in the distance a lake that a couple of days ago I was on the other side of. Around 2:45 it started to rain. I covered my pack and after a while I made it to a shelter for cover. There was a group there doing the same. We talked about where the good hostels were further down the trail. I did not make it to the shelter I was trying to get to. I stopped a mile short around 6:00 at a campsite where I met Joseph and Jim. I told them about my trekking poles and having to now use a walking stick. One of them made a Gandalf reference to my stick. Sorry Sharon, now I have to let the beard grow out. Shortly after that Meredith and Chelsey showed up. I had seen them last when I stayed at the Hostel. They had taken a zero day yesterday. Chelsey said she would have quit the trail had it not been for the day off. Now she should make her goal of 100 miles. Both of them with bad knees still caught up to me.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter.

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560087,As I was taking down my tent this morning I saw Plunge Pool walking towards the camp site with a pot of coffee for the four of us that were still there. Jim had already left. I have seen him at three different points along the trail now. He also gave me a cheese sandwich so I did not bother making breakfast. I hit the trail by 9:05. There was a shelter about a mile up Standing Indian Mountain that I was going to stop at. About an hour and a half later a guy named Wooly had passed me. I commented on the never ending climb. He said it's not that bad and that we should reach the overlook soon. I thought I was really moving slow up the mountain but I was two and a half miles up still waiting to come across the shelter I passed a mile and a half back. As I got to the top and started down the other side Wooly was backtracking. We had both missed the side trail to the overlook site. It was about 0.2 miles off the A.T. I took some pictures and took a granola bar break and then back to the trail. From there it was a long gradual decent to the next shelter where I was just going to stop for a break. On the way a stream cut across the trail and figured it was too beautiful to just walk by so I stopped there for lunch two pepperoni sticks wrapped in a tortilla. After getting to the shelter for a break I checked my phone and saw that I had service there. I read some encouraging comments from folks on the website (thank you all). I put my pack on and started to head down the trail and realized that I should call Sharon since I did not have service the night before when I usually call. She answered and a talked for about five minutes before I realized   She wasn't there anymore. I backtracked a little trying to pick up the signal and then figured I will check a little further down the trail. Since I had my headphones on I figured I'd listen to music. It was the first time I had done that on the trail. I did make the time go by a little faster. I don't know how often I'll do that in the future. Maybe I'll save that for the up hillsI did quite a bit of hiking through a section that had been burned by forest fire. There were a lot of downed trees but plenty still standing just scorched at the bottom a bit. I came across another overlook and stopped to enjoy the view. I was also able to get ahold of Sharon and we talked while I just stared out at the beautiful site. I finally made it to my destination around 6:00. Each of the campsites here are a bit secluded from each other. I waved to Meredith and Chelsey who had stopped at same place and were already settled in and continued down the trail until I found a spot secluded from everyone else. Today was probably the most pleasant of hiking days. The temperature was not too hot. And while there was a two and a half mile climb up the mountain it was a gradual climb and then there was a gentle decent and a lot of flat sections.,"Deep Gap

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560608,"I was off to a good start today. I had some level ground for a while. After I was headed uphill for a while I decided to listen to music to help me up. I saw in the guide book that there was a pretty steep climb to get up Albert Mountain. As I reached the base I saw just how steep. I had to use all fours to climb sections of it. During the climb the Blues Travelers song ""The Mountains Win Again"" came on. All morning I did not see another person until I hit this climb. Then I kept stepping aside to let them by. I finally made it to the top to find Plunge Pool to greet me with a cheese sandwich.I climbed the look-out tower on top and came down to see people I had been running into over the past week. Meredith and Chelsey were taking a break there. There were three guys, Brian, Josh and Gaucho that I had met at the first Hostel I stayed at (sad thing is from the Hostel they were starting from the approach trail so I had a 30 mile lead on them. I saw a couple of guys that I suffered the heavy winds with at Neel Gap. And Jaws an older Gentleman that I had passed back and forth with a few days ago.My goal was to reach Winding Stair Gap by the end of the day to get a ride into Franklin NC. As I was passing the second shelter of the day still expecting to hike three more miles a couple of hikers were coming up saying there were no good campsites at the shelter and that they were catching the 3:45 shuttle into town. I said there was no way to reach windy Gap by then. They pointed out that we could get on from Rock Gap that was just a quarter mile away. So I cut my day short. At Rock Gap there was Happy Jack to greet the three of us with a beer.We called a shuttle that brought us into town. By then there were about ten of us. Everyone else was going to a Motel. I was the only one going to a bunk house. When I got there I ran into Joseph from a couple nights ago who gave me a beer and later half his pizza.Upon arrival I showered and did my laundry. Of my clean clothes were a pair of underwear and a pair of socks. I figured there weren't too many people around and my boxers kind of looked like shorts so it was okay to walk around the corner of the building in those ""shorts"" to the laundry room.After I got dressed I ran into others I had seen before, Pumpkin from Blue Mountain and a couple of guys that shared a ride with Sharon and me into Suches a week earlier. After talking with friends back home who were out on a Friday night I headed out to the Lazy Hiker Brewing company. I ran into Wooly there.

Joseph had said that he moves around a lot. It turns out that he has been working concessions with Ringling Brothers and he has been living on a train for quite a while. After breakfast we walked to the local grocery store for five days worth of food. I just need dinner stuff for the next five days. And then it was back to the hostel to catch the shuttle. The shuttle was making two stops one at Winding Stair Gap where most people got off and then to Rock Gap for me and one other. At Winding Stair I saw that there was a trail angel set up there. I would be hiking to there in about two hours. Lucking she was still there. She had supplies for me to make a ham sandwich, I had a tangerine, some peanut M&Ms and a soda. She suggested that I take some more stuff for later, she had quite a spread of stuff, but I had plenty of food I was already carrying. After a couple more hours of hiking I got to my destination. The campsite had a much smaller crowd than past sites. There were six of us in total. We sat around the table an each made our dinners and talked and then had a not so successful fire. There was an Indian guy about my age called Cowboy ( because of his cowboy camping, not a counter to him being Indian) an ex army guy Miles who is now a Chef who does those ten course sort of meals, a former military woman called Anchor, a vegan called Blood Moon who was saddened by the food pictures of that Mile's was showing especially the precooked picture of lambs brains, and a guy from South Africa, I did not get his name.","Rock Gap

Wheel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560620,"Took a while to get going this morning I think I was on the AT by 9:40. Part of it was that there was a half mile steep uphill climb out of the shelter site to get back to the trail. About an hour in my right calf tightened up. I had strained it two days ago. I thought I had walked it off yesterday but I guess not. A half hour later I had just crossed a road and was heading uphill when I saw a car pull over and offer some trail magic to another hiker so I turned around and headed back down. Elena and Tom from the local Hiker club gave me a banana and an Easter Egg. More importantly they took the trash that I had hauled out of the shelter that someone had left from earlier in the day. Tom's involvement in the club is trail and shelter maintenance so they thanked me for carrying it out.I continued hiking mostly uphill and was passed by Wooly a couple hours later. I figured he would have been way ahead of me but he had taken a day off. We both had gotten to another road crossing just as Tom and Elena were driving down that road so I took another banana. Perhaps the potassium will help with my legs. I stopped later at a trail intersection where the guide book says there's a historic site. I stopped there to have lunch to decide if I want to take the half mile detour. Cowboy from the night before caught up but did not want to check out the site. I left my backpack behind a tree and took the detour to find a ranger station built in 1916. It was worth the trip. I later caught up to Cowboy at a stone lookout tower that had its roof burned down in a forest fire last year. I showed him pictures and he said he wished he had gone.While still sitting at the tower eating a snack ""Duck Farts"" an old guy that was in the bunkhouse with me two nights ago walked by. I know I was moving slow with the calf problem bit he had taken a day off. I got back on the trail. About 45 minutes later I heard someone come up behind me. I stepped aside, it was a 20 something girl. I said hi and said I was worried it was the old guy catching up. Knowing there was no way I would make the next shelter I stopped at the Licklog camp site where I knew Cowboy was going to camp.

They must have stayed at the shelter a mile back and got up much earlier than me.Two miles in I got to Burningtown Gap and there was Plunge Pool treating hikers with his cheese sandwiches again. Soon after Duck Farts showed up. We talked for a bit and then I continued on. I made it to the next shelter before noon. There was a girl from Germany who was taking a zero day due to a sore on her foot. She asked me if I was going to camp there tonight. She said she was bored out of her mind. I think she was looking for company but I continued on. Finally I was passed by Duck Farts. He's got to be at least in his late 70's, a big fuzzy white beard and a pony tail tucked up under his hat. He hiked the trail about 16 years ago. Looking at him I would guess he's been on it ever since. He just looks like someone from the mountains.Further up the trail I came across a sign for a view from Rock Bald. There was writing on the sign not to miss it. It was 0.1 miles off the trail but was pretty steep. I left my pack part way up but grabbed my lunch. I figured it would be a great spot to eat. I took a picture and before I could sit down it started to rain so I headed back for my rain jacket and to cover my pack and to continue hiking. After half an hour it let up and got warm again. The rain would come and go until I got to Wesser Bald shelter where I ran into Duck Farts, Jaws and a couple other guys. Cowboy showed up soon after.

Finally around 8:00 it let up enough for me to get out of the tent and start hauling stuff over to the shelter. Jaws was already hitting the trail with Duck Farts not to far behind. I was planning on a short day so I was in no hurry. After packing up most of my stuff and eating the usual breakfast of oatmeal I went to dismantle the tent including wiping off all of the mud that had splashed on it.I hit the trail by 10:00 on a very foggy hike and within 40 minutes the rain picked up again and continued for the next 5 miles.   It was a long downhill hike with a few tricky spots especially in the rain. I did slip once onto my back. Luckily the back pack cushioned the fall. I finally got into the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) around 2:00 where I had booked a bunk for the night. I hung out with Cowboy for a bit then went to do laundry where I ran into Duck Farts. While waiting on laundry i learned that Duck Farts is a drink (Kaluha, Baileys and Crown Royal). I figured he got the name from the way he snores. I had shared a bunk room with him in Franklin and it looks like I'm doing the same tonight. After laundry I finally made it to the bunkhouse, took a shower and headed off to the Rivers End restaurant for a burger and beers. On the way I ran into Tom and Q-Tip which I hadn't seen since last week. It was good to see them. They had taken a few short days and then a 12 miler today to get to the NOC today.

There was supposed to be a look out spot to views of Nantahala Gorge about 4.5 miles into the hike but it was nothing but fog. 6.7 miles in I hit Sassafras Gap Shelter where I stopped for lunch. Having had a big breakfast I did not stop earlier. Plus I case rain was coming I wanted to get to the shelter. There I met Aaron and Ben from Maine. They were going to stay there for the night to get a spot in the shelter in case it rains tonight. Around 3:20 I left to do more climbing. This part was pretty steep. It took me almost an hour to get to Cheoah Bald at 5062 ft. By then the fog had cleared and it was a fairly clear view. After a few minutes at the top I started the descent down to the campsite I felt like I was walking forever finally getting to the campsite by 5:45. There was one other camper there, a range runner name Maury.

There was a couple from Panama City FL that stayed at the campsite They had passed me early on in the day with their dog Murphy. They are doing a section hike up until Fontana Dam. I would catch up with them at common break sites. The first was at Stecoach Gap, a road crossing where a trail angel had left a bunch of apples. I had a couple. I had planned on getting to the second shelter I came to that day but then Jacob Ladder happened. It is a section that climbs 600 ft in 0.6 miles. In most parts of the trail climbs this steep usually have some steps built into the trail but this was just a trial going straight up. It was very difficult to walk. Thank God it was not raining. It was wet enough from the overnight rain. Just after reaching the top I came to Brown Fork Gap Shelter for a lunch break. At the shelter was the couple from Florida, Charles who I met down by the apples and ""Blue"" who I had met the day before. Everyone was talking about the climb. 
From there I hiked up out of the shelter and got to a high point where I could make some phone calls. I spoke to a friend Andy in Kentucky who might join me for a few days in a couple of weeks. I also spoke to a friend Ken in NC who I plan to meet up with in Gatlinburg next week. 
I got a hold of Sharon. She told me that she had gone to Pinstripes Restaurant in Oak Brook because John William who has a talk show on WGN radio was doing his show from there. We had met him a couple of times on some cruises that he was a guest on. She went up to say hi to him and mentioned what I was doing. He was getting ready to come out of a commercial break and told her to hold on. When he back on the air he introduced Sharon on the radio and talked to her about my hike. 
After the tough climb and spending sometime on the phone it was going to be late by the time I got to Cable Gap Shelter. Also i heard that it was going to be pretty crowded as it's the last shelter before Fontana Dam so I stopped at Cody Gap campsite where the couple from FL is camping.

I got a call a week ago that Top of Georgia Hostel had found my trekking poles and were mailing them to Fontana Lodge. 
I got to the Shelter in about an hour and a half where I stopped for water and then continued on the trail. From there I never took a break until I got to Fontana putting in about 8 miles by 1:30. My back was feeling sore from the pack and my feet and legs weren't feeling too good either. 
I took the shuttle to the lodge to get my poles. Along the way the driver picked up Matt (now called ""Opie"") a kid one year out of high school from southern Indiana. I had seen him off and on about a week ago. The driver waited for me at the lodge to then give me a ride to the general store to resupply and do laundry next door. I ran into Jaws who I hadn't seen it a while either. He had gotten into the lodge the day before and was taking a day off. 
Afterwards grabbed a BBQ pork sandwich and beer at the Pit Stop. 
I later learned that I could have hiked all the way to the shelter where there was a shower before shuttling into the village instead I took the shuttle back where it originally picked me up to the hike the mile to the shelter. It was awfully tempting to shuttle straight to the shelter and skip the mile. It was still pretty humid and I was hoping I would not sweat too much as I now had clean clothes on and still was going to shower. 
At the shelter I staked out a spot in the shelter (my first night in a shelter) and then got in line for the shower.

I got to Clingmans Dome where I ran into folks that I had seen when Sharon was stil on the trail. I figured they would be way ahead of me but they have taken some zero days.
Jim was at Clingmans Dome. He was always walking a bit faster than his sister and was surprised when I showed up and had not passed his sister. She had actually gone to the parking lot. He went down to look for her. I told him that I would keep an eye on his pack. I had some lunch there figuring no sense in going to the top of the lookout tower as it was still foggy.

And then inside saw Blood Moon who I have not seen for over a week. 
I was hoping to find a Frogg Togg jacket which a popular on the trail and pretty affordable. Unfortunately the choices were $100 jacket or $7.95 poncho. I went with the poncho and I'll keep my not so waterproof rain jacket for now. 
Ken then drove me back to Newfound Gap as the rain started up. I brought all my stuff into the restroom to get out of the rain and to organize my pack. And then headed out.

There was no water to be found until our destination 12 miles away.   Maybe three miles in I caught him heading back for them. He was very grateful that I was carrying them. 
On the way a deer ran across the trail right in front of me. My first wildlife siting besides squirrels and birds. But we see those in the forest preserves and home so not as exciting as a bear spotting would have been. 
Weather wise it was a beautiful day. Much of the hike was on a ridge with drop offs on both sides. If I fell down the right side I'd be in North Carolina. If I fell down the left side I'd be in Tennessee. I had spectacular views of the mountains on both sides. 
High up on the ridge I had a signal to make a few phone calls from a couple different lookout spots. Plus is was a good excuse to take off the backpack and take a break.  
It did make for a long day as I pulled into the shelter around 6:00. The shelter was full so I set up my tent.

There was a little climbing to start and I had a great view from the top where I took a snack break. After that it was a pretty long downhill to Cosby Knob Shelter at the 7.7 mark. It was only 2:00 so I was still debating wether to continue while getting water and eating something. In the Smokeys it is required to stay at the shelters. 
I decided to continue on the the shelter at 14.8. After a 0.8 mile drop to Low Gap there was a 2.1 mile climb to Mt Cammerer. And the sun and warmth that I wanted so badly was now beating down on me. I think I went through half my water on the climb. As I got near the top. Two women were coming down from the peak. I had noticed from the guide that there was a lookout tower at the top and remembered the Hostel owner at Top of Georgia specifically mentioned this one to go out of your way to see.

It was a pretty cool stone structure with incredible views unfortunately it added an hour and a half to my day and actually put me at 16 total miles for the day.  I figured that there was a long downhill after that so it wouldn't be so bad. Most of the downhill was pretty rocky so it still to some time to make the descent. The trail did get better a few miles in where I made up some of the time.

About of a mile of the hike today was along a good flowing stream with plenty of small waterfalls. It was one of my favorite stretches of the trail. Then I got to a section where sit was walking along a road that fed into highway 40 (not as scenic). 
Its is funny that knowing it was a short walk today psychologically seemed to make me get tired more quickly and make my pack feel less comfortable much sooner. 
I pulled into the Hostel pretty early, took my shower in the outdoor shower, did my laundry by hand using a washboard and then Jaws shared his pizza with me. From there I went into the hostel's resupply room where it was on the honor system. I had to take a envelope and then just write down the food items and prices of things I take. 
Hanging out with other hikers I met ""Yard Sale"" from Andersonville in Chicago. She had a few days off and procrastinated a few hours in getting back on the trail today

The climb wasn't as bad a some of the other towns but within a couple of miles the rain started up and then pretty much lasted all day with a few short breaks. I would take those opportunities to eat something. I also took one of those opportunities from a peak where I had a rare signal to call home. 
Continuing on down the trail I would always try to figure where I am along the trail and how long it will take to get to the next shelter. In the guide book it said that there would be a grave stone.

There was a church group grilling hamburgers and hot dogs. They had several different types of salads and lots of baked goods and soft drinks. It was an incredible feast in what seemed like the middle of nowhere. Luckily the miserable weather we had been having caused them to delay their three day trail magic fest.

They asked how my hike was going. I said if the trail stayed like this I could easily do 16 mile days Smooth Talker said that will come in Virginia. I said I'd have to come up with another excuse by then. 
The trail stayed relatively easy for a few more miles. At a road crossing I met Tippy Toes, a trail angel I met way back in Georgia. He gave me a soda and a McDonalds cheeseburger. He was waiting for Deluxe and Smooth Talker who were helping Yard Sale. She had sprained her ankle and he was going to drive her into town. He was then going to transport Deluxe's and Smooth Talker's packs so they can slackpack to cover more ground. So I probably won't see them again. 
Then came the second half of the day. There were six more miles to go with five of it being an uphill fairly steep at times climb. This took about four hours. I came across Tunnel Rat who had been slackpacking since Hot Springs. He passed by me and then disappeared. 
I finally made it to the shelter and set up my tent around 6:30. I ate dinner and then sat around the campfire talking to other hikers, some familiar from previous shelter sites and then called it a night. Luckily it is not as cold as the last two nights.","South of Shelton Grave Site

The hike was much like yesterday. It started out relatively easy until it wasn't anymore. The hike up Big Bald was pretty tough but once I reached the top it was well worth it. It was similar to Max Patch in that there were 360 degree incredible views. There was another guy at the top. He was a local and had driven to the top.  After coming off the top and hitting the gravel road I came across a couple, Dave and Heidi, having a some wine near the top. They were visiting from Scottsdale AZ. They were very interested in my thru hiking experience. I really enjoyed talking to them. I told them that I had gone to Moon Valley HS in Phoenix. Dave had taught grammar school about a half mile away from there. 
From the Bald it was a short walk to the shelter. ""Doc""and ""Happy"" were a couple there who had taken some time off to go to Jazz Fest in New Orleans. They had brought back some praline candy the that shared with everyone. There was a guy a bit older than me called ""Ski Poles"" that I had stayed with at several shelters recently who had arrived a bit earlier. ""Concrete"" showed up a little later.

Today's hike was a bit easier. The uphills were short distances. And the downhills were very long. On the first major downhill fro Little Bald I had my first bear sighting. The bear must have been spooked from something at the top because it was running downhill at a safe enough distance away from me. 
While the second half of the hike was mostly downhill the last five miles seemed take much longer than it should have. My right achilles was getting pretty sore and I could not wait to get to the shelter.  I had arrived kind of early and if my foot felt better I would have considered moving on but then I also learned that there is no water for the next seven miles so instead I ate, gathered more water, and then used one of my water bottles as an ice pack for my foot.","Bald Mountain Shelter

He had an inflatable sleeping pad that made a crinkle sound every time he changed positions.

Took me to an urgent care facility where I was diagnosed with tendinitis.  I got a steroid prescription and told to stay off it for a week. On a positive note I stepped on the scale and I am down almost 50 pounds since starting the hike. 
I got back to the hostel and laid around icing my foot until the lunch run when I was able to pick up my prescription. Then it was back to then hostel for more ice. 
It rained pretty hard in the afternoon and into the evening. At least earlier in the day I hung out outside with my foot up. During the rain I was just laying in my bunk. At dinner time I stayed behind while others went into town for dinner. That freed up some of the outdoor covered area where I could make some ramen.
Later when the dinner crowd got back I met a hiker, Chris, that had some of his gear stolen in Hot Springs. He had also arrived just before dinner having hiked through the rain and his one coat that was not taken was drenched. He asked me if I had an extra jacket that he could wear until bedtime. I had just bought a new rain jacket and was going to put my old one in the hiker box so I told him he could have it. He gave me a beer and we wound up hanging out and talking with a couple other hikers, ""Acorn"" and ""Grill"". 
In the mean time a hiker from Evanston came in. I think he was around 20 yrs old. He was carrying a 58 pound backpack. Several the hikers helped him go through his pack telling him his current weight was going to kill him. He did not start from GA. He was only 20 miles in. With all of that weight he had very little food which would put him way over 60 lbs. He was carrying a laptop, a knife reminiscent of Crocodile Dundee, too much heat clothing, and a bath towel. They got rid of most of it. When asked about the towel, he commented that he read hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and that having a towel was necessary. I think he was joking. He agreed to let them cut it in half. In the end he got down to 40 lbs and sent the rest home.","Erwin TN

They are avoiding the heat of the afternoon and then are going four more miles to next shelter. Perhaps I should have done the same to get more miles in, but relaxing by pool is nice too. Just wish they sold beers here. 
Soon after I typed that last sentence, Cindy, a woman that I was talking to earlier at the pool came back from her RV with a grocery bag with a few beers in it for me. I had made a similar comment to her that the only thing missing about this place is that the store does not sell beer. 
For dinner I had another burger and sat and talked to an older woman whose husband is hiking the trail. She is following along in their RV and meets up with him every three or four days.
Then I headed back to the pool and a large Pennsylvania Dutch family came to the pool. I had asked the dad where they were from because they had an accent. The dad was asking me about the hike and soon all the kids in the pool were gathered at the end of the pool listening.","Cove Mountain Shelter

The woman  looked familiar and then realized she was at the hostel in Erwin. Her name is Pearl. We talked a bit then I hiked on. I took a break at the first shelter I got to and soon after Pearl showed up with a few others I met back in Erwin, (Songbird & Hoot) and Tunnel Rat who I had crossed paths with over a 100 mile stretch also showed up.
I hiked on to the next shelter and saw my first rattlesnake along the way.  The  same group caught up again. I learned the Pearl was a recent grad of ASU so we talked about Tempe a bit. 
Everyone hit the trail again but they all got ahead of me. It has been mostly uphill all day and I've been moving slower and slower. The guide book said that the next shelters water source was unreliable so I filled up all four of the liter containers I had which added a lot of weight. 
The last part of the hike took me under a site call the guillotine. It was large rock suspended between two rock walls. 
I finally got into the shelter site where we would be camping for the night.  There was another woman Hiker the named Savage working on a fire to get rid of the bugs. I learned that one of the other woman hikers named Lake was a deadhead. She picked that up from here father. Why couldn't my kids have done the same.","Jennings Creek

They were just leaving and commented only 9.9 until beer and food. They were all heading into Glasgow for the night. I had resupplied at the Middle Creek Campground so I am skipping the town visit. At that same gravel road I met Snake Eater who was part of the Green Beret charity AT relay team. I told him to say hi to Omar and Jen who I had met back in the Smokeys as part of that same relay.
I reached the road that would have taken me into town after crossing the longest foot bridge on the AT which is actually named after William T Foot. If someone had drove up and said do you need a ride into town I would have taken them up on it. Since that did snot happen I pressed on th o the next shelter. It was a nice hike along a river for a while before starting uphill. When I got there around 7:30 there was just a a southbound couple at the site. Stay we're going to tent behind the shelter.

Once at the top however there were some beautiful views. Just before reaching the second outlook spot I came across Snake Eater who I met the day before. He was headed southbound.  He had gone into town the night before and then arranged a slack pack hike from a spot north of town back into town. So he got the benefit of covering the same section as me but hiking downhill. Plus he gets to spend another night in town and then they will drop him off at that same spot with his pack to continue north. 
As I hiked I ran into two others that were on that same slackpack hike. The second one was called Blue Hat. She was an older woman whose brother lives in Elmhurst.  We talked about restaurants we have eaten at there.
I reached Punchbowl Shelter around 5:00 where I stopped for a break and talked to a couple hikers there for too long. I pushed on planning on going to a campsite 4.5 miles up trail. When I got to the gravel road where there was supposed to be camping I looked in the book again to see it was supposed to be 0.2 miles south. I backtracked beyond that distance to find nothing. I turned around again and headed back north. I crossed the road and finally found a stealth spot about half a mile further.

Which will eat into my mileage for the day. The first six miles of the day got me to the road that leads into town. I heard it was tough getting into town about nine miles away. I stuck out my thumb and the first passenger car to drive by picked me up. It was a young woman named Sarah with her dog Sylvanus. She has hiked and has had to hitchhike herself. She dropped men off right at the grocery store. After shopping a guy heading to his car waved me over asked me if I needed a ride into town. (The grocery store is just outside of town). His name was Piney and is a shuttle driver for hikers. I asked him how much to take me back to the trail. 15 dollars later I was on my way back and only lost an hour and a half of hiking time.
The next part of the hike was much like yesterday. A two thousand ft climb over a three mile stretch. Then a mile downhill to the shelter where I realized the shelter was 0.6 miles off the trail. The next campsite was 2.5 miles away and uphill and I was out of water so I headed to the shelter. I figured no one else would want to veer of trail like that but there were two women at the shelter. There was tent sites a little further off and they headed there. Soon after a Quaker camp group of about 16 high school age kids showed up and went on to the same tent area. With there arrival I decided to set up tent near the shelter as did Red Fox a hiker that showed up as the kids were headed to there spot. ","Camp site past Reservoir Rd

Temperatures have dropped into the 70's and the humidity is down.  Overnight it was actually pretty cold. So cold the I did not want to get out of my sleeping bag this morning. 
The site I was in had two trails going out of it one was the trail I took in that gets me back to the AT. The other one connects with the AT further north. The difference is that that one goes around a mountain where as the one one I should take goes over. It was awfully tempting to go around but I did go over. 
There were some nice views from the top but I would not mind if the AT would go around once in a while. It reminds me of doing a day hike with the family in the Shenandoahs a long time ago. Part of our hike was on the AT but then We hiked to a waterfall that was not on AT. I thought at the time it is too bad AT hikers don't see this. Now I'm feeling I don't need to see every view and an easier hike wouldn't be so bad. 
By 3:30 I made it to a shelter where I took a break. The afternoon hiking just seemed to go on forever even though this was much easier hiking than the last two days. While there Foxy showed up and his friend Doc a woman he had been hiking with. I did not stay too long food and a rest put me in better spirits which was needed because I still had 6.6 more miles I wanted to get in to get to the next shelter. 
Hiking went fine for the first half then more uphills. It was a steep climb up to Spy Rock where there would be a detour and some rock scrambling to see the view but I was racing sunset. While I say racing I was moving pretty slow. 
I got to the shelter site right at sunset. When I was putting up my bear line I did not have enough slack in the rope and I rapped itself around the branch twice. So then I had to go find a ten foot stick to play piñata with the rock that was tied to rope until it unwound. Luckily it only took a few swings.

Songbird, Pearl and Lake who had camped up at spy rock to watch the sunrise this morning made it to the shelter before I left. Every shelter has a log book where hikers leave comments. I have never entered anything. With this shelter being named The Priest Shelter the log book here is a list of confessions by hikers. I did not read it but the others were commenting on some of the entries.  One was ""I clogged the toilet an Uncle Johnny's Hostel and did not tell anyone""
We all left at the same time but they were much faster than me. I caught up to them at the bottom of Priest Mountain, a 4.8 mile rocky 3000 foot descent. They stopped for a lunch break so I joined them. 
The plan for today was to go 15.5 miles to then hitchhike to Devil Backbone Brewpub. Little did I know what was ahead. Pearl then said now to climb back up the same elevation up Three Ridges Mountain. This was going to take place over a six mile stretch so it should be a little more gradual. I replied that I was enjoying my lunch in ignorance and she just ruined it. I figured I've done these climbs before and should be able to handle it. I was wrong. The first part was gradual to the first ridge but then It was like an obstacle course there were sections of the trail that were very rocky.  Then came walking across boulders. Then a steep section where I had to use all fours to get up. Including a break along the way it took me five hours to get up the 5.8 mile ascent. At the top I had phone reception so I called Sharon to let her know what a miserable day I was having. Even the hike down was unpleasant as it was just as rocky as the Priest Mountain descent. To make matters worse the pub closes at 9:00 on weekdays. Knowing that I would not make it I stopped at the shelter short of the road to the pub. The pub also allows for tenting on their property and is supposed to have a good steak and egg breakfast. Quite the bummer at the end of a miserable day.","The Priest Shelter

I had looked at the forecast that showed only a 40% chance. I was hoping it would stay away but no luck. I got into the shelter around 7:30. It had a pretty big covered area over the picnic table which was nice. A couple other hikers had also gotten in late. It was nice not being the only one.

The driver asked me if I needed a ride. He said he was building up some Karma for when he does the hike in a few years. I saw Matt outside and told him we have a ride. The driver was an older talkative guy who told us of some of the history of the area. 
We got to the trail and the driver pointed out the Zero mile marker for the Blue Ridge Parkway and then took our pictures at the marker. 
Starting up the trail we had to register for the Shenandoah National Park. There Pearl and Lake caught up to us. 
Unlike many of the other town visits, coming out of Waynesboro was not a big climb out. It started with a gradual 1000 foot climb and then a few ups and downs. Nothing greater than a few hundred feet. 
It was a dry hike. No water until just before the shelter. When I got to what I thought might be the stream it was pretty dry. It was 0.1 to the shelter so I figured I would hike there hoping that this was not the water mentioned in the book. Luckily it was not. There was another stream just 100 yards further. 
I got to the shelter now with four liters of water. Matt, Pearl, and Lake had already beat me there. There were a few other hikers already there too.

About half a mile out of the shelter site was the top of the summit. I put my pack down to climb up the rocks to see the view. Had I come across this later in the day I probably would have walked on by. There were a few day hikers up there already. Hiking though the Shenandoahs you come across more day hikers than usual. So it was not as lonely as the trail was just south of here. 
About seven miles into the day I got to the Loft Mountain Store where I bought some more trail food along with a few beers. I had one of them outside the camp store where Grasshopper and his dad were as was Mantis and a few others hikers. Just up the trail another mile and a half was a Wayside Grill. Mantis and I headed there for Burgers and Blackberry Milk shakes and to drink the two other beers I bought.
Continuing on from there we came across a few water sources but I had enough to get me to the shelter. Mantis had gone ahead as I was adjusting my backpack. She was looking to go beyond the shelter I was heading to. 
It was a four mile hike with a few ups and downs and my knee was starting to hurt more. I checked the guide book along the way anxious to get to the shelter when I noticed the water source at the shelter was marked as unreliable. I was so happy to see the stream flowing as I headed towards the shelter. 
Short Cut was already there along with Q2 another hiker I had met a long time ago. There was a group of a five section hikers from a hiking club in Ohio.

An hour into the hike Caroline shouted bears.  We then saw two bears about fifty feet away from us then run off in different directions.  One of the bears the switched directions to follow the other.  They seemed to run towards the part of the trail that we were headed.  A short while later an oncoming hiker said that he did not see them.
Five miles into the hike we stopped for a snack break.  This was at an intersection with a side trail.  Other hikers were crossing by and we learned that the trail was a loop that went to a waterfall.  Since we weren't carrying heavy packs and knowing that I was going to get off the trail we decided to take the 3.8 mile detour.  It was kind of liberating no longer feeling the need to concentrate all my hiking towards putting in AT miles.
it was a gradual downhill with the first stop at a lookout point facing the top of the falls.  We sat there for a bit and debated whether to go down to the bottom of the falls.  My knee was a little sore and Sharon suggested that She and Caroline hike down.  I said I would go and could always turn around if it bothered me too much.  I glad we hiked down the waterfall was even more beautiful at the bottom.
After a few pictures we started hiking out.  the sole of one of Caroline's boots started to fall off.  She had a hairband that she used around the toe of the boot to keep it in place.  She had borrowed the boots fro Sharon.  At a water break the two of them switched shoes.  The trail back to the top was more scenic than the route we took down.  the first half of it followed a stream for a while.  Caroline was slowing down quite a bit on the second half of the uphill.  We were happy when we finally reached the AT again.  At that point it was around 5:00 and there was still 3 miles to go get to our initial goal.  My knee was sore, Caroline was tired from the uphill and Sharon's boot was falling apart.  So instead we just did the 0.1 trail up to the picnic area.  While we only did 5.2 miles of the trail our total hike for the day was 9.0 miles.  At he picnic ground there was a couple that just finished hiking and the agreed to give us a ride back.Back at the campground I ran into Tunnel Rat outside the store as we were headed to the showers.  I introduced him to Sharon and told him I was calling it quits for the season.  The plan was to backpack north for another day but I had my doubts.Back at the campground a lot of the campsites were cleared out as it was now Sunday night.  Over the past few nights i could hear owls making a screeching sound.  Tonight we actually saw several of them flying from tree to tree.  Four of them had gathered on the tree near our campsite which attracted several of the other campers over towards our site.  ","Lewis Mountain Campground
