CarJack!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552380,"I've dreamed about hiking the Appalachian Trail for 25 years and began seriously, but hesitantly, considering it three years ago. Though I didn't admit it even to myself, subconsciously I was planning. Little by little I replaced all my heavy gear bought in the 90s with the newest lightest weight stuff I could afford thinking with every purchase ""will I want to carry this on my back for 6 months?"" Still I never spoke the words out loud, ""I'm going to hike the AT!"" I followed hikers on TrailJournals, read every book I could get my hands on, and talked about the trail to my friends til I'm sure they were sick of me. Though I'd hiked some of the AT in New England on day trips and short backpacking trips I'd never spent more than a few days on the trail. Then in late summer of 2015 I ""officially"" began section hiking with my first ""longish"" distance AT hike, a 12 day trip, with my friend Terry, hiking from Salisbury CT to Bennington VT completing my home state of Massachusetts. Publicly it was a section hike. Secretly, it was a shake-down hike. It was indescribably beautiful. We took our time, appreciating the crystal clear streams, farmland, rivers, beaver ponds and mountains. What it really did was to fuel the desire to really hike the trail. I'm not a risk-taker and I'm not particularly brave. But I want this more than anything. So I at least have to try. I asked for and got a three month leave of absence from work and in late March will hike the approach trail to Springer Mountain. My goal is to hike half the trail this year ending in Harpers Ferry. While I couldn't see leaving my job for 6 months I am grateful to have three. And if all goes well I'll be back for the rest. So I've told my co-workers. I've told my family and friends (who of course were not surprised.) I'll be backpacking alone for the first time in my life which is truly scary. Still it doesn't seem real. I am nothing but excited to do this but am waiting for the fear to kick in. Then, I think, the dream will finally feel real.",,View Entry,"Dec 11, Sun",0
CarJack!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553252,"So I was right. Fear kicked in over Christmas. Away from home and visiting family for four days I was staying in a strange house belonging to a friend of my sister's. On day one I got homesick. What the hell! I'm gonna be gone from home for three months walking through the middle of the woods alone! I panicked. I had already told everyone I know that I'm doing this and started the process of renting out my house. There's no going back. The one thing that calmed me down is this: I will forever regret if i dont try. And anticipating something is always scarier than doing it. And I love my tent. It truly is my home away from home and i always feel good when I'm in it. And I'll be surrounded by people and i always push myself to talk to strangers when I'm alone and have met many interesting people that way. And really the whole Christmas thing was because I usually have Christmas at my house and i missed it. A glass of wine and catching up with family and i was fine.It was really a fear of lonliness. I will for the first time in my life be backpacking alone, something I thought I'd never do. When I got home I made a playlist of my musician friends' songs so I can hear their voices on the trail. I reached out to the hiking community on line. I talked to friends who assured me I can call and text them any time. They'll still be here when I get back. That fear finally made it real. I know it'll come back again,probably when I book my flight to Georgia - one way. But for now I am simply excited!",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Fri",0

They are a nice young couple referred to me by a friend who are saving money for medical school. In exchange for low rent, they will be taking care things while I'm gone - watering my plants, mowing the lawn, watching over the house. So I'll be moving this spring - to the Appalachian Trail!",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Sat",0
CarJack!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555153,"Booked a one way flight to Georgia. 26 days to go and I am so excited! I had been so caught up with planning that has nothing to do with hiking - getting my house ready to rent, finding a temporary replacement at work - I was losing sight of how much this hike means to me. I had been feeling more scared and anxious than anything. Finally I got my old excitement back!I have only two goals in life. One is to complete the AT, even if in sections. The other is to climb a mountain every month of my life for as long as I can. (I won't be moving to Florida anytime soon!). I have been pretty faithful to the second one since I began five years ago. Of all the times to be falling short of my monthly hike goal now is not the time, yet somehow I missed December and January. Last weekend I finally got back to my favorite mountain to hike in winter and totally rekindled my drive to do this! Mt. Monadnock in southern New Hampshire is less than 2 hours from Boston and at just over 3000ft it is small enough to be manageable on short winter days but challenging enough to be tons of fun! Last Sunday the sun was warm, the sky brilliant blue, ice and snow were streaming down the mountain all around my friend Jude and me, and from the summit we could see the tiny skyline of Boston about 70 miles away. It was a rare day! Boston has been having the kind of weather you dream about. I love all the seasons, including winter – cold, snow, all of it. But every New Englander knows there is something insanely amazing about a 70 degree day in February. The city streets fill with people. Street musicians come out to play. A sense of euphoria fills the air. We haven’t seen anything like this since the Patriots won the Superbowl – again. Okay so that was only three weeks ago but you get the drift. These are the days that get you psyched for walking in the woods, eating, sleeping, and living outside. I’m completely prepared for winter camping at the start, at least as much as I’ll ever be, but this weather has got me daydreaming about nights by the fire and sleeping in my tent. I can’t wait to get down there and begin.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Sat",0

My co-workers gave me a card with good luck wishes. They have been incredibly supportive picking up extra work to cover my responsibilities while I'm gone. I am grateful to them all - especially Rachel G., Bonnie and Helaine, and Ronnie for giving me the time off to do this. Though I am not doing this hike as a fundraiser I want to let readers of this journal know about the great work my organization does. The Irish International Immigrant Center is a non-profit based in the Irish traditions of social justice and ""Welcoming the stranger"" that supports immigrants and refugees from all over the world with legal, wellness and education services. Some of our clients have endured hardships far beyond what I will experience on the trail.
I am extremely proud of the work IIIC does and to work with such an amazing group of dedicated people.

I had my shoes off, hung out on the porch and chatted with other hikers. It was a fun day of swapping stories, weighing packs and debating the merits of taking the approach trail verses going straight to Springer. At least 5 of us will take the approach trail which is a tough extra 9 miles to get to the AT. But it looks really beautiful and I may never come this way again so I'm going for it.

Spent the night at Springer Mt Shelter after hiking the approach Trail. The falls were beautiful and I'm so glad I took the approach.

He's a Southbounder  who was hiking his last day on the way to Springer Mountain and the end of his hike. He and his buddies hiked through the winter!   I asked him how it was hiking the trail through the winter. He said ""gnarly""! I bet!
Another one is Lucy ""Tequila Mockingbird""   who was spectacularly ill prepared. She decided five days earlier to do the trail and came on with a 3 pound child's sleeping bag with turtles on it and no rain jacket. She was quite entertaining (loud talker!) and a great sport. Others were trying to help her out but last I heard she had left the trail. Being an obsesive planner I have to give her credit for just jumping in.","Springer Mountain

Got on about 8:45?? I'm guessing. It's so dark in the morning still at 7am. I see other people moving around with headlamps but it's tough to begin when you're snug in your bag. I'm developing a routine of starting each morning by stretching inside my sleeping bag. No sore muscles yet son must be working 
These Georgia woods are beautiful. I hike all day with views of the mountains on either side through the bare trees, and through rhododendron tunnels.  I have lunch listening to streams and wake up listening to barred owls calling to each other. It's a good life.","Hawk Mt Shelter

CarJack!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558306,"So while we were hanging out at the shelter a guy came up the trail with apples and said that he and a group of people would be treating hikers to breakfast the next morning down at Gooch gap. Trail magic!  That got my butt out of bed early!  Whenever I got down to the gap and saw the canapy set up and hot coffee and egg and sausage muffins, fresh fruit and yogurt , banana bread, chairs to sit in I nearly cried. It amazed me that people would do this. This group had been providing trail Magic for nine years. They had been there all week offering dinner and breakfast to hikers. They were people who loved hiking and the trail community and this was their way of sharing their spirituality.
The group I was hiking with were all there. Chris, Satchel, Little Bug, Pecostin? And his dog who are from Germany. We continued on to woody gap and got there at about lunch. More trail magic!  Hot dogs burgers a fire and oldies on the radio. It was a bit drizzly and so nice to warm by the fire and have hot chocolate. These guys just loved hiking and became trail angels to be part of the community. 
My plan that day was for nine miles. But all that food got me to Lance Creek at 2:30 pm. I thought about pushing on another 2.5 miles but it was so pretty I stayed. Then I was antsy. Lesson learned: if you have daylight hours and energy left keep hiking!","Gooch Mountain Shelter

I had 7.4 or so miles to Neel gap and reservation at Blood Mt cabin where shower and laundry awaited. Hiked through cloud all day and up Blood Mt. Met Satchel and LB at the top and several other hikers. We were thick in cloud and mist, missing some great views I know but it was lovely in its own way. Coming down the mountain it was steep and rocky in sections kinda like the hiking back home and it was tons of fun. Familiarity can be good. 
At Neel Gap saw Amanda who had gotten ahead but had to take a 0 day because of her knee. Chris was th er email too and Satchel and Little Bug. So most of the people I started with were together again.

They are one shelter behind me but I wanted to do a longer day. It was a hard decision to separate from the people I knew but in needed to move on. In the end it was a good decision. I camped at the top of a mountain and watched sunset and moonrise and fell asleep under the stars. It was truly beautiful. A few other campers including a nice family were there and built a fire to chat by. An odd thing about these mountains: you can hear wind howling somewhere on another peak but it can be completely still where you are. So it was on Rocky Mt.,"Low Gap

I took my time packing up trying to stay dry as long as possible. I was the last one outa camp at 9am. It was so foggy it was hard to see. Drizzle turned to an absolute downpour. I didn't see anyone and sang every song I knew to keep myself going. My rain gear held for about two hours. After that I was soaked to the skin. Then the thunder started. I found a rhododendron tree and huddled under it waiting out the storm. One bolt and thunder was almost simultaneous it was so close! Suddenly a hiker in a big orange poncho came out of nowhere. It was Benkt, a German guy who had been the last few shelters i was at. Never was I so happy to see another human! That big bolt had been right next to him. We waited out the thunder and decided to hike the rest of the way together. We got up and over Albert Mt (and passed the hundred mile mark!) before the thunder started again but finally made it to the shelter at about 2pm. Long branch is a new shelter and really nice. It's clean and well covered and there was room for us among the other hikers who were all in their sleeping bags getting warm and dry.

Max was a hiker I knew who earned the name Bigfoot for having size 16 feet. I finally made it up to Wayah bald where there's a bathroom and parking lot. Guess who was there. Big foot! We had some lunch together in the sun and a past thru hiker named Pyrite who looked like a pirate gave us each a banana. Fresh fruit on the trail is the best!

I learned so much from them and so appreciated that they shared their journeys with me. So I had all good intentions when I started my own journal recording my ""half-thru"".

So, alas, I did not keep my TrailJournal for very long. I am home today. I made it to Harpers Ferry on June 23, 3 months from when I began. I accomplished my goal.

To have fun in town. To live in a tent! Until then, happy hiking to everyone out there right now and future hikers to come!","
