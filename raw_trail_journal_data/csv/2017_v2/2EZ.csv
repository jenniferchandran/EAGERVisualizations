2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552965,"Hello, AT world.I started this journey last year, taking off in early March for the trip from Amicalola Falls to the NOC. I got a good taste of the trail, enjoyed my trail family, and ran away as soon as I saw how addicting it could get. I was given the trail name 2EZ, or too easy, but I prefer it my way. Every time you get to the top, or bottom, of one of the many Puds, the ground levels out, you catch your breath and stride, take in the view, and then it hits you. The trail only gets too easy for a minute, then it's back to work. I guess after a few times vocalizing the worry that the trail has gotten too easy, you get stuck with the moniker.It had the added advantage of fitting my life, as I hope to make my sons, Evan and Zack, proud of this trek.I had scoured the internet, built what I thought was a perfect gear kit, and gone through all of the worry, hoping to give myself every advantage on the trail. I was successful for the most part, had a light enough kit, knew how to hike and camp, and had shoes that didn't hurt. So no worries at all for this year, right?Wrong. I still find myself questioning every item, fretting over ounces, choices, mail drops. It dawned on me today that preparation is wonderful, but all that is just passing the time until the journey begins.I hope to enjoy the trek, build memories and friendships, and have the trip of a lifetime.Thanks for taking the time,Dave (2EZ)",,Maine,"Jan 05, Thu",0
2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552992,"Sorry to go on a bit of a rant, but it has seemed increasingly difficult to get through all of the garbage on the internet to get to actual data, or answers to questions.As an example, a simple question of which of these two sleeping pads would better serve an AT thru hiker seems to result in an argument, a dozen non-answers, a few insults, and a HYOH.It feels like the same five people answer every forum post, always with a negative overtone, and anyone else that comes into the cool kid club gets hazed.After looking into Baltimore Jack, reading his posts and listening to interviews, it seemed he was on to the same thought. He fought to ensure new hikers felt welcomed into a community, welcomed every newbie question, and countered every negative attitude expertly.I would like to be remembered as someone who welcomed every new member to the long distance hiking community, respected the efforts of every hiker, and gave people respect. He was a true legend in that regard, as well as his crazy love of the AT.Can't wait to get out on trail, meet some new people, and enjoy every day as it comes.Rant over.Happy days,EZ",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Fri",0

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553110,"So some of us in the South don't have much in the way of weather to test our gear, whether it be tents, sleeping systems, or clothing.As we had our coldest, and rainiest, weather of the year so far, I figured I'd set up a safe and easy quick test this weekend.Lesson 1The Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 is NOT a free-standing tent. As there was a steady stream developing into a small lake across my property, I set up camp on a raised wooden deck. It is completely feasible, but requires tie- outs at six points, and it left my vestibule slack. Not ideal at all. Left the rain fly slack enough to touch the side walls and made for more condensation than I was happy with.Lesson 2Cold rain sucks.Aforementioned condensation managed to get to my sleeping bag and made for a less-than-ideal sleeping arrangement, and would have been an issue going forward if it were on trail. Sleeping pad and pillow were great. Lesson 3Clothing is a system.I did get to test my clothing, and found that everything layers well and would keep me warm well below freezing. Nice to know the pieces work together.Lesson 4Whiskey works. Maybe not for everyone, YMMV, but a little whiskey makes the pain and the cold and the rain less like a trial and more like a funny story to tell.Overall, a good test, and a good initial feel for the changes I have made for this trip.EZ","Home

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556055,"In one week, I will be dressed in green, drinking Irish Whiskey with my wife at Shenanigans Irish Pub in Dahlonega, Ga. We will sleep in town Friday night, then drive to the trailhead early-ish Saturday. My beautiful wife will walk the 1 mile South to Springer Mountain with me, get the obligatory picture with the plaque, then we will start. 7.4 miles to Hawk Mountain Shelter. My wife will camp with me that night, then say our goodbyes Sunday morning. She has a long day of hiking and driving, and I get to head North. I can't wait. That whiskey is going to taste good!","

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557073,"Day 1 March 18th8.2 milesParked at Springer Mountain and walked the mile up to the summit and start of this journey. It was foggy, wet, and sloppy going, but not too cold. There were so many footprints, it got me to wondering. How many of those footprints are exactly like mine? Starting out this trail, hoping to make it far, hoping to make family friends and myself proud. I hope I am still making footprints after the numbers have thinned out as people get off the trail for any of the possible reasons. I was very happy with my gear and pack; it really makes a difference having light weight and good shoes. Got to Hawk Mountain camping area- thought it was the shelter. Nope- just a decent place to camp. No group chatting around the shelter. No campfire. No socializing. Wish there was some more of that. Hopefully tomorrow.Â In the morning my amazing wife will leave and head back south to drive home. I am blessed to have a gorgeous, smart, caring woman who supports me doing this. I will miss having her with me. On a good note, the tent isn't really made for two. It's really hard keeping all our junk organized and clean with two people stepping all over each other. More miles tomorrow.","Springer

Got going very slow, both from the cold and from not looking forward to walking away from my wife. We took our time saying goodbye, but it was freezing, so the trek had to get going. Walked from the Hawk mountain campsites, eating snacks thru the day, right past the Gooch mountain shelter at 8 miles in, so had to keep on to the longer mileage. It will put me in to Neel Gap a day early, and get some distance from the early crowd. Lots of campers again tonight, but not much socializing yet. I need to find the people I'd like to chat with. I miss my family, but did get to make sure my wife made it home safe.","Hawk Mtn

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557077,"Day 3 March 20th18.8 milesStarted the day early. Walked with my snacks as breakfast at first light, and made it to Blood mountain early. I was the only person up there. Shot a short video, then called my wife. Good to see her smile. Then trekked down the mountain to Mountain Crossings, an AT staple. Found that I forgot to pack my charger cable for my battery pack. Dumb! My amazing wife saved the day, and mailed one to a hostel a few days away. That screwed me up though, and I just hiked more than I needed. I didn't plan my hike with water in mind, and stumbled into camp late, and with only one sip of water left. Mistake ridden day overall. Gorgeous views on the Mountain though, so all was not bad. May take a day off soon. My body is hurting.","Lance Creek

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557259,"Day 4 March 2115.4 milesStarted out the day early. Took pictures of tiny water sources that looked like waterfalls, then loved watching the sun burn off the misty sky. Only planned ten miles to road, then a break at a hotel. That didn't happen. Felt ok, figured I'd keep going. Hot afternoon, big climbs, lots of pain, but progress. Got to Tray Mountain, set up camp, took pictures, ate dinner, then came the thunderstorms. Winds that test your tenting setup, constant lightning(every few seconds at most), it was frightening and exhilarating. About ten thirty the thunder and lightning slowed, and good sleep came. Short day to come.","Low Gap

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557258,"Day 5 March 2211 milesDay started out cold and misty and windy. All my hiking clothes were wet on a line, all my gear was wet and muddy. No choice but to get moving. Thankfully, Georgia allowed me the opportunity to climb 800 feet in .8 miles, a 19% average grade, to see the last view in Georgia over 4000 feet. Of course, there was no view. After that, it was easier going, and I almost skipped along the trail to finish the 11 mile day to get to my first NERO, or half-day off trail. Hiked into Top of Georgia hostel to pick up a package, then took shuttle to the Budget Inn. It is not a place you would ever vacation to, but works perfect for hikers. Shower, laundry, dried and cleaned all gear, resupplied for next leg, ate bad, and drank some beer. House cleaning, grooming, dishes, shopping, dining, and relaxing, all before dark. It was a well-timed break, and just what was needed to keep going. Now for some family phone time, rest, and back to the grind tomorrow. With a little luck, I'll get out of my first state tomorrow.","Dicks Creek

Shuttle back to Dicks creek gap then hiking by 930. Found Tigger, who I met a couple days back, and hiked with him. Good pace, hard hills leaving Georgia, then the GA/NC sign. One state down... Reached Muskrat Creek shelter at about 230 and decided to trek on. Lots of evidence of forest fires, saw burned forest all day. . More hard climbs and an interesting Tolkien scene of a rock trail in a green field, then settled down at Standing Indian shelter. No phone service, good group of folks that hiked hard today. Hobo Joe and Kim, Eclipse, Justin, and Ellie all joined in for the extra credit miles. Cold night, recovery and stretching before another tough day tomorrow.","Dicks Creek

The trees that are left are tough, they will survive. Made for a somewhat depressing hike, misty forest of dead trees and blackened ground. Mostly smooth hiking until Albert Mountain, which is a quarter mile of extremely steep climbing up to a fire tower with a wonderful view, even though fog hung over the mountains. Crossed the 100 mile mark. Still a long way to go. Finished the day up at Long Branch Shelter, completely full, sore and tired and ready to hike on towards Nantahala Outdoor Center.","Muskrat Creek

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557618,"Day 8 March 2518.2 MilesEarly reveille to hike my little trail family out to Winding Stair Gap for their NERO/Zero days in Franklin. Started hiking in the dark, and right at dawn, we came upon trail magic at Wallace Gap. Coffee and donuts!!! Great way to start a day. Got them to their shuttle, said our goodbyes and was off alone again by 10. More burnt forest. Tigger had asked me after we started hiking together if I preferred hiking alone or with a group. At the time, I told him that the Miles go faster as a group, but you see more hiking alone. Back alone, I want to change that answer. Hiking by yourself gives you lots of time for introspection, perhaps too much. I like people. Long day, lots of miles, and a great view from Wayah Bald Observation Tower, which has been damaged by fire as has everything else. Stopped early and stole a shelter spot to sit out the coming rain at Wayah Shelter. One more long day until a well deserved NERO.","Long Branch Shelter

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557817,"Day 9 March 2615.5 MilesWoke to rain on the tin roof of the shelter. No issue sleeping for me, but one woman, Tequila Sunshine, said that as soon as we fell asleep, a mouse ran right across the front of the shelter and started messing with a couple of the packs, and kept her up all night. I walked out as the rain stopped, nothing but burgers, beers, and a shower on my mind. More burnt forest, that seems to be a recurring theme. Great view today from Wesser Bald tower, which I had heard had burnt down. It had not, and the climb was rewarded with 360 degree views of our unfettered wilderness. I hiked way too quickly today, in fear of the weather forecast of thunderstorms after 1 o'clock. Only a light sprinkle as I entered the shelter area at Rufus Morgan, and now I only have a quick 1 milehike in for a NERO day in the morning tomorrow. After doing camp chores, and ready to cook some dehydrated muck, I look up and see a face from 12 years in my past. Brian Hickey served in the Navy with me, and came out with some surprise trail magic at the end of a long day. Beer and junk food! A very welcome and unexpected surprise that I will never forget. That made the sore muscles and tired bones feel a lot better, and humbled me at the same time. Thank you. What a journey!","Wayah Bald Shelter

Little shopping, laundry, and Hobo Christmas, package opening time. Checked into the bunk room early, got a long shower and a shave, and organized gear for another stretch. Great to relax for the day and heal some of the aches and pains. Thankful for all the support, and for my body for enduring the trials so far.

Packed up at the NOC, ate an unsatisfying breakfast, no pancakes, just undercooked French Toast and eggs. Took off north right into a difficult climb of 3400 feet over 7 miles. No easy sections, then two more difficult climbs just to cap the day. Definitely the hardest day on trail yet. Only 12 Miles in to the Fontana Dam area, and another resupply for the Smokies tomorrow. For tonight, a crowded shelter full of extremely tired hikers. A mini milestone today, over 150 miles hiked. Many more to go.","NOC

A lakeside view and a shower at a shelter! Quick shuttle into the Fontana Lodge for my resupply package and a stop at the general store for a soda and an ice cream. Way too much food in the resupply! Sorted all my belongings to start the Smokies tomorrow. Big group at the shelter, but the tent pads are all cement, so freestanding rents only. Sure it will be loud and late to get to sleep tonight, but I am extremely ready to get started hiking the Smokies. All in all a good half day of hiking.","

2EZ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558245,"Day 13 March 3014.8 MilesAll the excitement I had about getting in to hike the Smokie went away by 730. I walked down to the Dam before realizing that I somehow threw away my Smokies Permit. About a mile or so hike back, a fruitless attempt to look through the garbage, then I waited until 830 to catch a shuttle to the Fontana Lodge to print another copy. Got back to the trail at 930, and started the climb into the mountains. Every climb hurt a little more today, and pushed the heart rate a little higher. The forecast was for thunderstorms either in the afternoon or night, and the winds were a gusty 30mph all day. All in all, a painful day of hiking. Still into camp by 330, meal and relaxing in the crowded shelter. Rain forecast for tomorrow as well, so it will be a tough first couple days in the Smokies.","Fontana Dam

Walked out into the rain at 730 to tackle muddy slippery trails and hard hills. No views all day as everything was socked in. Tried my best to go slow and steady all day, and finished at Double Spring Shelter at around 330. Beautiful Evergreen forest starting right before the shelter made the end of the day amazing. Brisk and cold tonight, but Clingmans Dome is only a few miles away, as is our 200 mile point. Also, we've been hiking the NC TN border, so there's another state reached. Not a bad day, just wish these mountains were a bit more cooperative than they've been lately. More miles to go.","

That was 4AM. Again at 5, the peaceful hippies around me all rose to see sunrise on Clingmans Dome. A cup of coffee and a slow start for me, then the cold hike out through the Evergreens. Gorgeous morning. More than the highest point on trail, more than the 200 mile point. I get to see my girl in a few more days. Motivated my way to my first 20 mile day. Muddy trail all morning, until Newfound Gap, and then day hikers to keep me company until Charlie's Bunion with great views. Great hiking the rest of the way.","

Out of camp and on trail first equals collecting spiderwebs. Easily my best hiking day so far. Great open views and easy trail along with crisp and sunny weather. The last views from the Smokies were the best. Afternoon heat and hot trail beat the feet hard. Davenport Gap Shelter is the only shelter this far to have a chain link fence to separate the animals from each other. Only slightly creepy. Easy day tomorrow into the hostel then short miles towards Hot Springs. Just hope I can get some signal to talk with my younger son on his birthday.","

On the way out of camp this morning, I checked the weather forecast. Storms, with lightning, some severe. Battery bank needs to be charged. Feet hurt. Hostel.

First one out of the hostel in the morning, ready to get close to Hot Springs so I could walk in early Wednesday. All the happy thoughts filled my brain through the climb back up another 3000'. Not a very exciting trail all the way through the next climb up to Max Patch. Somehow I missed the note that Max Patch is amazing. I didn't understand how wide open a space, how great a 360 degree view of Mountain you get there. It is expansive and beautiful and neither words or pictures could quite do it justice. After that, my feet worked better, the trail was easier, and life was happier. I made it past 20 miles with ease. I could walk all day. Then I got in touch to finalize plans for tomorrow. My girl can't get here until the afternoon. Still had my best, and longest, hiking day yet. Still get to see my love tomorrow. And I set up camp at a rock outcropping with waterfalls that run from a hundred feet above me to a hundred feet below me, with a view of the sunset on the mountains.

It was the first time I camped alone on trail, and was completely relaxing. Broke down camp and was off on trail and 730 for the short hike into Hot Springs. More up hills than I had seen on the map, but still a very quick hike into town, and then a big breakfast at the diner. Laundry done, then rain showers to sit out while waiting on my lovely visitor. It is amazing having your own trail angel come visit in trail, meet the people you've been hiking around, and spend some time in your crazy adventure.
