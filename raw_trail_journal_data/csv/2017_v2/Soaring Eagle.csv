Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/417921,"I was informed of this site today, wish I had known earlier, and decided to give it a try. I am planning a solo thru hike NOBO starting on 1 March 2014. While I am somewhat nervous about starting, I am mostly excited. I have received a yes from a couple of companies that will sponsor me. As long as I am doing this I also thought it would be a good opportunity to raise some money for our local food bank. I have already met with their marketing staff and they are equally excited about my upcoming adventure. This hike will also give me an opportunity to gather information for a couple of books I am currently writing. I don't plan on writing while on the trail but I do plan on bringing along a micro recorder to catch my thoughts. If you see an old guy on the trail mumbling to himself a lot next year the chances are it will be me. Of course,I have read this walking and mumbling is quite common on the trail. On second thought, you might not recognize me. This hike should be a real test. I am a retired Air Force veteran (24 years) and have PTSD from 30 years of being around dead, dying, and severely injured service members. I am hoping to bring awareness to PTSD (we are all not crazy postal workers looking to cause harm). Actually, just the opposite. I want to get back into life, get over my fear of people, and find inner peace. Oh, and I plan on fly fishing at least once a week. These will be my zero days. One of my books will detail this experience. I have most of my gear but, keep changing things out as I read others comments and books. I am currently recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery that I had three weeks ago. Already up to walking (without a pack) 7 miles a day. I hope to hit the AT in top physical condition. My goal is to average 20 miles a day. I am giving myself 5 months to hike, fish, and enjoy God's great planet. Keeping my fingers crossed that the next 9 months go smoothly and I am standing on Springer mountain come March 1st.",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Sun",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/418042,"Just read my first entry. I need to make sure and proof read when I am done. Hiked 7 miles yesterday. Knee is a little sore today. I may be pushing it a little to hard so soon after surgery. No walking today! I have been reading a few journals from thru hikers. Learning a lot about what it takes to persevere on the AT. I am so looking forward to 1 March 2014. 
Had to come back and update. My 5 year old grandson dragged me out of the house and we ended up going for a 3 mile hike. Actually, I ended up packing him some yummies and he had his first hike to the river. Oh, he is autistic, so everything (especially the pace walked, with time to pick flowers) is his choice. I let him take the lead and taught him cadence. Hup, two, three, four. He ate it up. I see a future backpacker In the making. Hope the woods are still there when he is old enough to do the AT. The best part of the hike for him, other than being the leader, was throwing rocks in the river. It was by far the best hike I have ever been on. Oh, and of course we had to stop by the park so he could play in the castle. What a great day.",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Mon",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/418296,"Not much walking today. Did spend a few hours fly fishing on the river today. Not much luck but, wow was it relaxing. The water is fairly warm. Now for the big news of the day. I received a box today from Buck Knives. They agreed to sponsor me by providing some products. What a surprise when I opened the box and there were two knives (1 hunting and 1 ultralite with spork), 2 hats, 1 awesome water bottle, and a knife sharpener. I am their new biggest fan. They are the first to actually say yes to sponsorship and actually send me something. This is turning into one fabulous experience. I wish tomorrow was March 1st. Oh, the two day break from brisk walking has had a real positive effect on my knee. It feels great.

Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/418421,"Walked twice today. First one 4 brisk mile hike. Knee felt great. Starting to feel much stronger. Second walk was 2 mike crawl with my grandson. Basically a walk to the river, throw some rocks, eat his snack, and back to the house. Amazes me how much joy a grandchild can bring. I wish I saw my other grandchildren more often.",,View Entry,"Jun 05, Wed",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/418589,"Will walk later this evening. Had to write about my friend from Maryland who passed away from cancer. He was bigger than life, even if he was only 5'6"". And, he loved to fly fish. I had planned on stopping by to spend a day fly fishing the Chesapeake Bay with him when I do my hike next year. Now, I will instead dedicate my fly fishing book that I am writing to him. I miss you Gary. You really were bigger than life. Always, always had a way a lighting up a room. I will miss him dearly. I know he'll be with me on the AT.",,View Entry,"Jun 06, Thu",0

Knee feels great. Tomorrow gonna try to do 8 miles. Reading David Miller AWOL in the AT. Nice book. Reads a lot like these journals. Really gives a view of what is to come.

I was looking at the picture, which was taken last year, and noticed how much thinner I look today. I guess this walking and changes eating habits is having a positive effect. Have to do a long walk today, and it is pouring out. Nothing like getting used to what the AT is going to be like than walking in the rain. At least that is what everyone writes. Guess I will find out in March.",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Mon",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/420302,"Walking is going great. Doing between 4 and 6 a day. Knee feels awesome. Pulled the bike out, gave it a tune up, and I am going to give the knee a real test. Keeping my fingers crossed. Finished reading Earl Shaffer's, Walking with Spring. Bought a signed first edition. Great book. Very nice read. I would definitely recommend it. He truly was a pioneer. Started working on my gear list. Time to start buying the major items so I can test them this fall. Looking forward to August when I am making my purchases. One thing I have learned. Hiking gear is not cheap. Would buy it now but I am sending my daughter and her family to Puerto Rico in July. Happy hiking.",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Sat",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/420754,"Have a damn cold. Shit!!! Still rode the bike 10 miles but was to ragged to get my walk in. How the hell did I get a cold?

Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/420900,"Zero day. This cold is kicking my ass. Received emails today from the Boston Red Sox and Cabelas. Cabelas has agreed to be a sponsor and asked for a list of what i need. Awesome. The Red Sox, my favorite sports team, are sending me some their products. I had asked them to send me a signed hat to wear on the AT. In turn, when I complete the AT (and I will finish it) I will give the hat to a Boston charity so they auction/raffle it. I am like a kid right now. In a million years I would never have thought the Red Sox would honor me in such a way. I am so blessed. God surely loves me.",,View Entry,"Jun 17, Mon",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/421083,"Did a great long bike ride. Getting ready to go walk a few miles. That should do it for the day. Amazing how much better my leg feels. Like I never had surgery. I may move up my training schedule to start testing it for real. Thinking about hitting some mountains this weekend. Nothing to serious, just want to get a feel for how I am really doing. Won't know until I throw on a pack and hit a couple of mountains. I have spent a good portion of the morning emailing back and forth with Cabelas. Sounds like they are really serious about helping me out. One of the things I am doing to seal the deal is providing my sponsors with an elongated AT map which they can display along with the pictures I provide during the hike. An agreement that seems to work well for both parties. I have limited the number of sponsors to cut down on weight. Most businesses want me to carry their shirt or hat (I always push for a hat, lighter to carry)and take pictures of it. A few extra hats to carry is not to much to ask as each sponsor has agreed to donate $250 to our local food bank. I am trying to raise 5k for the food bank. Most of the donations will be individuals who agree to pay the food bank a penny or two for every mile I complete. Hope I have not bitten off more than I can chew.",,View Entry,"Jun 18, Tue",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/421239,"I finally did it, ok, I sort of did it. Did what you ask? Walked with a pack on. Ok, it was a small backpack with a full water bladder and a bunch of other items to add weight. It only weighed 17 pounds but it is a start. Walked 5 fast miles with the pack on and I feel f...ing wonderful. I also rode a couple of miles on the bike early this morning. Also, stopped by a fitness center just a mile from the house and looked into becoming a member. I need to work on my poor excuse for an upper body. By the time I hit the AT I plan on being like a machine....until of course the mountains start kicking my butt.   If I get into great hiking shape BEFORE I get to the AT it should go a long way towards helping me in completing my goal. My only real worry is how my feet will hold up. 10 years ago I ws running 100 miles a week and never had any foot problems. I am praying the same holds true for my upcoming AT hike. So far my feet have responded much better than I would ever have expected. Keeping my fingers crossed. Happy hiking",,View Entry,"Jun 19, Wed",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/421292,"God surely loves me. Today I found an awesome program for veterans. The organization is called Warriorhike. They believe in the Walk Off The War"" philosophy. This organization, started by two war veterans who thru hiked the AT after their final tour of duty, is meant to replicate what Earl Shaffer did. Come home from war and get rid the of the junk in your head by walking the AT? How damn awesome is that. Right up my ally. I sent them an email and they want me to hike with the warrior group in 2014 on the AT. It will mean some flexibility on my side. Not a problem, time and flexibility I have a lot of. The big news is they will finance all of my GEAR. Holy shit!!! Of course, not being an idiot, I signed right up. Free gear, spending time with fellow veterans, hell, I don't think it can get much better than that. The great thing about this program is the VFWs along the trail provide food, lodging, rides, heck just about anything you need. How great is that. This organization works hand in hand with the AT Conservancy. It does create a little problem with fitting in as much fishing as I want to do. Flexibility right. I am so stoked.",,View Entry,"Jun 20, Thu",0

Ex wife is coming to pick up a couple of the grandchildren for the summer. Poor kids. Just kidding. Peg is great. We just weren't a great couple. Such is life. Its always nice visiting. On a much better note, I recevied a box from the Boston Red Sox today. It contained a great card and even greater hat. The hat was signed by 5 players to include Dustin Pedrio, and Clay Buchholz. It will travel with me on the AT. When I finish the AT I plan on giving it to a Boston charity. Hopefully they can use it to raise some funds. Its going t o hurt like hell handing the hat over.

They have all of my gear ready for pick up. All freebies. Plan on using them for training in the Adirondacks. Most of this hiking will be daily 15 to 20 mile hikes with very little tent time. I will wait and see what I get before deciding if I need to buy other gear, use Cabelas, or hike with warriorhike. Right now I am leaning heavily towards going with warriohike. They provide the gear, and you get to hike with fellow veterans. The social side would be awesome. However, at some point I will most likely venture out on my own so I don't spend an entire 6 months doing the hike. I will have to see how it goes. Heck, I might have such a good time with warriohike that I won't mind the 6 months.",,View Entry,"Jul 15, Mon",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/426413,"Finally, a break from the heat. Have been walking and biking every day in this miserable heat in the northeast. Today it is only going to get to 80. About time. I can't even imagine what it must be like walking the AT in this heat. My hat is off to all the current hikers. It has to be torture. I guess if you're not getting soaked in the rain, you get soaked in sweat. Sure hope the weather is more accommodating next spring. Only time will tell. Headed to the Adirondacks in two weeks to begin my real training, a couple of months hiking the Adirondack 46 peaks should give me a flavor for what the AT is going to be like. My plan is to do a peak every day until all 46 are done. Next Friday I have to make a road trip to Cabelas in CT to get my gear. Cabelas is sponsoring me and have agreed to give me all free gear. How awesome is that.",,View Entry,"Jul 20, Sat",0
Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/429305,"Training is going awesome. Started using one of the locals hills for my daily walk. Take it all the way to the top. The hills are not that steep but, they beat the hell out of walking on the flat sidewalks. I am averaging 6 miles a day, every day. I am still riding the bike at least 4 days a week. I have lost a few pounds, and kept it off. I feel really great, both physically and mentally. To me it is just as important to make sure I am mentally tough BEFORE I get to Springer as it is to be physically tough. I know there will be tough days psychologically. I don't want my brain to be the reason I don't succeed on the AT. Actually, there will be NO reasons that will keep me from meeting my goal. I finally made it to Cabelas in East Hartford CT. They really went above and beyond. I walked out feeling like the guy who won the lottery. Almost $1,000 worth of hiking gear. What a great company.

At 18 months of age she had a liver transplant. At the time she was the youngest person to ever have a liver transplant in New York State. Gradually, her liver started to work less and less. She thought she had a new liver last week but the harvested liver was not in great shape. Today, still waiting for a new liver, she quietly passed away.

I found a topo map of one of the local hills and was surprised to find out it was almost 1800 feet. I figured out a loop and off I went. I never stopped. Not even once. Even wore my small pack with the water bladder filled and a few items for weight. My legs really feel good. I am actually really pleased. My feet came out with a couple of hot spots but no blisters.   Have to keep working on the shoe thing.   Tomorrow is an easy day. Hiking to the river with my grandson. Those hikes are always the best. The little guy does really great considering he is autistic. He stops a lot to check out flowers, stones, and sticks. I wouldn't trade it for the world. He is progressing so well. I have been with him since birth. It is going to be so difficult leaving him in March for the AT. My daughter has promised to meet me when I get to PA on the AT so I can get my Noah fix. It is going to be one great reunion. Still need to get my application out to warriohike. They are such an awesome organization. It is going to be an honor to hike with this group. Falling more in love every day. Trying to talk my girlfriend into retiring a few months early and accompanying me on the hike. She loves to hike and lives in the Adirondack Mountains. She is surrounded by great trails. She hikes every weekend and is in much better physical condition than I am. She wants to do the AT, just has to work out the work thing. Hope she can.

I have had a lot of practice dealing with the elements. It has mentally prepared me for just about anything mother nature can dish out. It's all mind over matter. I have zero reservations about the mental aspects of being on the trail. It is getting physically ready that is the real challenge for me.

Of course he took the time to walk every curb on the way home. He is Autistic, but seems to be progressing well now. He is finally talking. His sixth birthday was this past Saturday.

Pretty steep at the top which required some real scrambling. I only fell on my ass once. Not bad. I felt good after the hike, tired but felt like I could have gone a few more. I purchased a new pair of hiking boots, Obozo's and a really nice pair of hiking pants. They will definitely help get me through the days that are cold or rainy. My girlfriend became a Saranac 6er with the completion of this hike. Now she is going to do the same trails this winter to get her winter rocker patch.

You are a brave soul. I am back into training. My aching body is feeling much better since the accident. I am so ready to get this hike started. Can't wait until March. This AT hike has consumed me. It is all I think about. I spend my days reading everything I can and walking. I think I have read every review on every piece of hiking gear available on the market. It can get very confusing. The gear is so damn expensive. When I first decided I was going to take the plunge and dedicate a year of my life to this little adventure I had no idea what I was getting into. The voyage has been awesome. I have become so much more in tune with the hiking community. It was exactly what I needed at this point in my life. I feel so blessed to be able to do this. God surely does love me.   On a sad note, I broke up with my girlfriend. Love her to death but the timing was all off. Maybe I am being a little selfish but this trip was planned long before we met.

He sends me a one liner, ""I give you a 12 percent chance of making it half way"". At first I thought it was someone being funny. After looking at this non finisher's trailjournals 2012 journal it is quite obvious I gave him way to much credit. He was definitely being sarcastic and unfortunately it looks like I have not been the only victim of his neurotic behavior.   On his thru hike attempt he didn't even complete 200 miles. Nothing wrong with not completing the hike. Heck, it is admirable to complete 200. However, if you are miserable because of your own shortcomings please keep that misery to yourself. Completing less than 10% of the trail certainly does not make one an expert on the subject. I guess we all react differently to failure. Attempting to complete the AT thru hike is hard enough.

For some reason Jimmy has decided his goal in life is to mess with me. I don't know this individual. He is a frequent reader of the journals on Trailjournals and likes to leave negative comments. First, he signs my guestbook and says I basically have little chance of ever making it. Then he leaves a message on another hiker's journal saying they have a better chance of finishing than me. I posted a message to Jimmy on my guestbook but subsequently deleted it. I am trying really really hard to keep positive and not let his negative energy get to me. It is not easy. I have PTSD from 24 years of military service. I really wish this Jimmy guy would find peace in his heart and seek help. Attacking people you don't know is not normal behavior. He obviously is reading my journal as I got another message from him today saying he lowered my chances even further because I mentioned in my last post that the Warriohike program asked me if I would consider doing the CDT if they didn't select me for the AT. Let me be very clear about this. My goal, dream, and drive are to do the AT. However, if the Warriohike wants to support me with gear and money to do the CDT I would be a fool to turn it down. My life goal is to do the AT, CDT, and become an Adirondack 46er. So Jimmy my friend, when you read this please take note. Your negative guest book remarks will continue to be deleted. Unless, of course you would like to offer hiking advice, make your posts positive, or just want to say hello. I wish you all a wonderful holiday season, especially Jimmy. A little advice for my friend Jimmy. Instead of tearing others down who are trying to do something positive with their lives why don't you try encouraging and embracing them.

ULA circuit backpack, Marmot 15 degree helium down sleeping bag, and a Big Agnes Seedhouse tent. They all have very good reviews from thru hikers who have completed the hike. I wanted to get gear that was tested on the AT. My back is not the greatest so my goal is to keep everything as light as possible. I will have to find a sleeping bag for the warmer weather but that can wait. Actually, my biggest concern is eating. I am not much of an eater. Trying to get enough calories in while hiking will be a challenge until I condition myself to the change. I used to run the weight control program for Plattsburgh Air Force Base. I have always been weight conscious. Getting to a point where I am gorging myself at a buffet should be interesting.

Today's little stroll will be an eight mile with a really great hill. After a few weeks of walking with my pack almost every day, I have learned a few things. First, I truly believe it is merely mind over matter. If you want it bad enough you have to be able to control your thoughts. Not always the easiest thing to do with PTSD. But, you can do it. Stay positive and focused. Second, your feet swell. I thought I was all set with my shoes but it looks like I will be buying a pair one size larger this weekend. Third, with trekking poles your hands don't swell. Awesome! Fourth, your choice of clothing is paramount. I walk fast and I sweat. With the clothing I have been wearing the perspiration really does get absorbed and pushed out of the clothing. Fifth, going downhill sucks. Lastly, walking in the cold weather is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I have been walking most days with the temperature hovering around zero. I still wear the same clothing as I would at 30 degrees and really have not noticed must difference. However, I will be really happy when my balaclava arrives in the mail tomorrow.

Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442128,"Funny the things that run through your mind while you're out walking and how it affects your walk. I have found if I keep my thoughts positive my walks just fly by. I bumped my pack weight up to 25 pounds on the first and thought it would be a struggle. In all honesty, I have not even noticed the difference. I started my first walk at 25 and at first could not think of anything but the extra weight. After the first mile I completely forgot about the weight. I did walk a little slower but that is mostly because I am working on slowing my pace. But, what amazes me the most is the role your mind plays. When I don't think about my pack, my aches and pains, or other negative thoughts, I seem to get into cruise mode. Before I know it I am coming back down my hill and flying home. I have also found that rests are a good thing. I used to be so time conscious that I would not even stop for a drink. Now, I always stop for a couple of minutes at the top of the hill and take a drink and catch my breath. It seems to breath new life into me. Learning some very valuable lessons that I will surely use on the trail. Slow and easy wins the race. Being a lifetime runner this goes totally against my previous mindset. Things I will miss while on the trail. This thought popped up yesterday on my six mile walk. First and foremost, my family. I live with my oldest daughter and her husband and son. Noah, my grandson and I have a pretty great relationship. I was there the day he was born and have been with him almost every day since. He is autistic and just a joy to be around. You have never seen such a happy go lucky kid in your life. Loves to dance and stay busy. He has zero inhibitions. He doesn't care who is watching. I kind of wish we were all a little autistic. I think the world would be a little kinder if we were. I will miss the simple things in life. Coffee out of the Keurig, dumping in a toilet, pillows, more pillows, even more pillows, my cat Henry, especially my cat Henry, definitely not my neighbors, working around the house, and the ability to go to the fridge for a beverage.

Let's just say they can startle you a bit. I was visiting some very dear old friends. They really got me started with my love affair with nature. They took me in when I was fourteen and gave me a job as a farmhand. The pay wasn't great but, the company was unequalled. My home life was not good, to say the least, and they provided me with refuge. They feed me, clothed me, and most importantly, taught me how to be caring, compassionate, humble, loving, respectful, appreciative, and a young man. We spent countless hours exploring the woods, hedgerows, and fields on the hill. Their mother passed a few years ago. She made the best chocolate cake with chocolate fudge frosting, on the planet.

Ordered a pair of Tevas, about one pound, and the camera weighs 8oz so I have lots of poundage left for food. The 17 pounds includes water. I am feeling really good about keeping my pack weight low. It should make hauling it 2,187 miles a little more tolerable. I have been walking with a 30+ pound pack the last two weeks as part of my training. The lighter weight is so welcomed.

My Tevas arrived so I have my camp shoes. My new glasses will be ready for pick up tomorrow. Everything is prepped, packed, and ready. Oh, that reminds me, toilet paper. Leaves are to rough. Picking up my dehydrated meals from my friends Hersch and Norm tonight or tomorrow. That is it. Everything is checked off. God will get me to the start and god will get me to Mount Katahdin.

I walked out my back door and the birds were chirping and there was this big orange thing in the sky radiating heat. I had heard about this happening last year. Just before winter set in. Hello Sun, I have missed you dearly. Please stick around for about eight months. Yep, the winter has been that bad.I am leaving this wonderful state of NY on Thursday by train to get my journey started. I will be in Georgia on Friday and start hiking on Monday. This past year of preparation has had many ups and downs and a few trip ending close calls. But, I have come through it virtually unscathed. A little poorer because of the gear purchase but my physical and mental self are intact. I am ready, set, go. All systems are on and functioning properly. My pack will start under thirty pounds, my food is being graciously donated and mailed, the water is free, and I feel like walking.

Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/444550,"Change of travel plans. Was supposed to be on a train today headed to Georgia. However, mother nature had other plans. Due to the ice/snow we received yesterday and last night I have decided to wait until tomorrow and fly to Georgia. I deplore flying. I have nightmares about dying on a plane full of screaming terrified people. I worked in the Dover Air Force Base mortuary for six years. Processed a couple of planes loaded with people, that crashed. Also started working in the Pentagon a couple of months after 9/11. Kind of takes the fun out of flying. Plus, it is just a hassle. Thinking about putting a large pepperoni in my pants to give the TSA screeners something to talk about. :-)Otherwise life is good and all is well. Saying goodbyes is tough though. I think I have cried more this week than any time in my life. I am going to miss so many people. Especially my daughters and grandchildren. I love them so much. Tonight will be my last night in my comfortable bed with my great cat Henry. Going to miss the hell out of Henry. If he wasn't such a fat bastard I would bring him along. He would terrorize those mice in the shelters. The local news station is interviewing me today. Chance to get the word out about Warriorhike. Afterwords I just need to mail a bounce box and wait until tomorrow morning. I can't believe the time has finally come to start this journey. It seems like just yesterday when I made the decision that I am going to hike the AT. Good luck to all of the hikers on the trail and those that will be following me up the AT.

Unfortunately, Mother Nature has not agreed with my plans and decided to spent the day watering plants. The festival was cancelled because of the rain.

Rained the first three days which was a great test. Only getting reception when I hit a trail town so updates will be weekly. Don't care for the shelters so I have only been stopping at them for water and to sign the registers when they are close to the trail. Georgia is beautiful. Have been doing some stealth camping which is definitely the way to go if you really want the wilderness experience. Received trail magic a few times. It is glorious. Two Warriorhikers have quit. The 84 year old only made it four miles up the trail. Everyone on the team are hiking at there own speed and we meet up every week for a trail town event sponsored by one of the veteran groups. This hike is as hard as they say. I have already seen a lot of people drop out. Couple of things I have learned. Speed kills. Walk slow and deliberate and preserve your energy and your knees. Especially on downhills. Make sure your shoes fit tight and retire them often. Rehydrated meals are heavy. Going to switch over to noodles and tuna with only a couple of dehydrated meals. You see no animals in Georgia. Heard an owl one night but that is it so far for wildlife. I will finish Georgia in a couple of days. Having a great time.,"

Feeling fantastic. No aches, pains, or blisters. Longest day so far was 16 miles which I did two days ago. That enabled me to do 12 miles yesterday and take a zero today. I have been gorging myself since arriving here yesterday afternoon. Had a great free breakfast at the First Baptist Church this morning and will be treated to a nice meal this evening from the VFW. Tomorrow morning before I get back on the trail the American Legion is providing breakfast for the Warriorhikers. I feel like I am being treated like a king. Still have to walk all 2,187 miles and carry my pack, but it sure does help boost the spirit when so many people support the journey. The hospitality and kind people I have met on the trail and in the trail towns has restored my faith in humanity. To date we have lost four fellow Warriorhikers. Three were hurt and one had personal issues that came up that required his attention. Hoping to get him and one of the hurt ones back at some point in the hike. Three nights ago Serpico blew out his knee. A couple of the Warriorhikers assisted him to the Muskrat Creek shelter. I ran ahead and luckily was able to contact 911. The local reuse team responded immediately and were able to stabilize his knee and take him out with a four wheeler. He is a great guy and I pray that he heals quickly and can rejoin us. The nights have been cold. The night Serpico got injured the temps were close to single digits and the wind was blowing hard. Oh, and it was snowing. If that is the worst that Mother Nature is going to throw at us then my weather worries are over. It is amazing I have been able to stay so positive. I know god has my back and that brings me great comfort. I don't know the word quit and as long as my health stays strong I truly feel I will be standing on Katahdin on 12 September. When I hear others being negative I simply walk away. The sounds of the animals communicating at night is beyond description. I wish I would see some of these great creatures God has placed on this beautiful planet. It would be simply awesome. The tranquility and peacefulness when you are lost in your thoughts hiking is far better than any psychiatrist I ever saw. I am going to come away from this such a better person. May you all find as much peace and love In your lives as I am finding on this journey. Thanks to all who continue to support my hike and bring awareness to those suffering from PTSD. Much love.

Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/448203,"My hike is going great. Yes, I am still on the trail. It is hard to get the time to update this journal when you finally come to a place where the internet is available. I am currently sitting in the Maggie Valley NC Inn taking a zero. Did 70 miles the last five days. Passed the 200 mile mark yesterday. Why Maggie Valley and not Gatlinburg? Because Warriorhike had an event here yesterday. Got into town about 5 yesterday. Did Clingman's Dome yesterday and the the 8 mile hike to NewFound Gap. Showed up and there was a wonderful couple from Florida doing trail magic. Iwas starved and ate like it. The hike through the Smokies is tough. Constant ups and downs. Not a lot of switchbacks. Feels like you are walking up to touch the stars. My body is still going strong. Had a couple of times when I questioned what the hell I was doing out here but was quickly rewarded with some magnificent views which righted my ship. The Warriorhikers are still going strong. We still have nine hiking and a tenth is coming back soon after getting his knee evaluated. He has already started hiking in Virginia and will rejoin us at Hot Springs. Everyone is still strong physically and mentally.a few things I have learned. First, downhill is as tough as they say. Just brutal on the feet and knees. Going slow seems to help. Second, there are definitely mice in the shelters.i woke up in the Russell Field Shelter and had a mouse chewing on something six inches from my face. Yep, time to get up. No more shelters. Rain, lots of it. You are going to get wet no matter how hard you try to stay dry. You get used to it. The trick is to not let it get you down. Waking up wet blows, but if you get up and start hiking you warm up and it is not to bad. The wind on the balds is viscous. When it is raining and the wind is howling it feels like you are getting pelted by ice. You just have to push through it and keep on stepping. Tomorrow is always new day and a chance for some incredible views. The people you meet along the trail is really a great mix. Young, old, fast, slow, rich, and poor. A real slice of America and the world. Almost all are outgoing, courteous, and respectful. The towns people are some of the most caring and kindest you will meet anywhere. When people hear we are with Warriorhike people have a ton of questions. They buy your dinners and will do anything to help ensure you have a successful hike. People really do appreciate military veterans. Sometimes the generosity is overwhelming. More than once I have had to wipe the tears off my face. The Quilts of Valor program presented each of us with beautiful handmade quilts in Franklin and even sent them to our homes. Incredible organization. My only regret so far is that I have had to pass up so many great trout streams. That will change in a couple of weeks when I forward my winter gear to NH and have my fly rod, reel, and flies sent to me. It may slow down my hike a little, but it will be well worth it. Have not seen any animals except for a couple of mice, squirrels, and lots of birds. You hear the animals at night though. Especially the coyotes. I will try to be more diligent updating this journal. I feel like I am finally in shape and have my routine down.","

Headed back to the trail after laundry is done. Have to hike two days and then being brought back off the trail for two days and sent back to Amicalola Falls, Georgia for an event. Then back to the trail and eleven straight days of hiking. This hike has been incredible. A true test of your will, spirit, and determination. Mine are all still strong and firmly intact. Have started to see a lot of animals which so enhances the hike. Trail magic continues to be a highlight. Nothing better than coming into a gap and finding trail magic. It lifts the spirits beyond measurement. I have been so blessed. It seems like I get to the best viewing spots on the best days. Max Patch, Clingman's Dome, big Bald, Charlie's Bunion have all been so great to me. I have had incredible views at each. So happy to be out of the Smokies. The shelter life blows. To dirty and loud. I much prefer stealth camping or finding a small camping spot. Have meet tons of great people on the trail. The weather is the biggest struggle. Rain, snow, windy, and cold seem to be the norm at least a couple days a week. Funny, once the weather and views improve you quickly forget about the bad weather you fought through. Putting on wet or frozen socks and shoes in the morning is one hell of a wake up call. Having a great time and finally have my hiking legs. Have been averaging 2 1/2 miles an hour. Definitely see some long hiking days in Virginia. Looking forward to some smaller mountains and a chance to get ahead so I can take a couple of zero days. God Bless everyone. Happy Easter!

We are extras and will be in a couple of scenes. Oh. Almost forgot. The movie stars Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. Having a great time. Best of all, they are feeding us non-stop. We will be here one more day and then transported 21 miles north of Erwin, TN to get back on the trail where we got off. The hike is going very well. Almost done with North Carolina. We have to be in Damascus Virginia in 12 days so there will be no stops once we get back on the trail tomorrow. The weather has remained unchanged. Always rains on the day I get back on the trail followed by a cold snap. My feet are getting used to it, if that is possible.

My hiking speed is averaging about 2.6 per hour. Never thought I would be able to hike that fast. Even then down hills are much easier. Guess I have finally become a hiker.    The trip to Amicalola was great. Got to meet Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. They were very gracious to have our picture taken with them. Once in a lifetime opportunity. Not sure if I will be in the movie but it was cool watching the process. Incredible amount of coordination. Happy to be done with the 6000 foot mountains for a while. Virginia has a couple of bumps but shuould be much easier than the states of Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. I finished North Carolina this past week and will be done with Tennessee in 3 days. I have completed 417 miles of the trail   Never thought I would make it this far so am elated with my progress.

Damascus, not so much. People don't seem overly friendly, no hotels, and few places to eat. All beds in town were full last night so I ended up sleeping on the garage floor. At least I got out of the rain. Raining again today so I decided to take a zero and recover from a tough week. Started hiking Sunday with a 24 hour bug. Only did ten miles. Followed that with 18 and 22 mile days. Really didn't want to start another three day hike in the rain today. Weather forecast is much more favorable the remainder of the week. Physically I feel great. Mentally, it has been a challenge. Nothing like carrying a heavy pack with wet clothing and tent to dampen the spirit. Now that everything is dry and clean and I have resupplied my food I am feeling much better about heading to Marion, Virginia. Have to do 21 mile days the next three days to get there but that shouldn't be a problem. I get my fly rod in Marion so the hike will only get better from here to Maine. Can't wait to wet a line. Gear is working fine however I am switching out a few Warriorhike items and going back to some of my original gear. Will be dumping all of my winter gear once I get past Mount Rogers. Will be switching to a. 40 degree sleeping bag, sending home my winter gear, and start hiking in my Tevas. Should lessen my load quite a bit. It has been tough keeping up with the Warriorhike schedule. Decided I will attempt to stay on schedule for the events but will stop stressing about it. If I make the events great, if not, oh well. My mental stability and having a stress free hike is more important. After all, that is why I am out here. Not knocking the program but it is tough to keep the hike every day, take no zeros for 180 days schedule. I love the program and have great respect for the founder. However, at my age, rest is important and needed. 467 miles done. Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee completed. I got this. God is in my corner. Failure is not an option.Soaring Eagle","

When I get internet service in town I am so busy cleaning, eating, and catching up with family that I don't get a chance to update my journal. I am in Pearisburg, VA. 631miles of the trail completed. Should hit the 1,000 mark in about 4 weeks. Feeling great. Finally received my rod and reel so the journey will definitely change for me. When I see a stream that looks like good trout water I plan on taking the time to fish it. Still hiking with the Warriorhike guys but doing it on my schedule. I actually made it to a Warriorhike event yesterday. I see most of the guys on the trail but I don't concern myself with the Warriorhike timeline. My daily mileage has improved greatly. I am regularly hiking twenty or more miles daily which allows me the ability to take zeros when and where I want. I catch the Warriorhikers on the trail a couple of days after they leave a town and hike with a couple of them. The weather has improved tremendously. Still lots of rain but at least it is warm. I have found that I prefer the longer hikes. Getting to a spot and tenting early seems like a waste of good hiking time. I try to get to my destination for tenting by 7:00 most days. Although I have hiked later on some days. Snakes have started showing themselves a lot. Seems like everyone has a snake story. And, we had a bear in camp a couple of nights ago. He hung around the food hung up on cables for a couple of minutes and then wandered off. Finally saw a deer this past Saturday. I think I was the only hiker on the trail not to have seen one. I have found that being able to hike twenty mile days changes everything. Besides the obvious boost in confidence it allows you a lot more flexibility. I can get behind the Warriorhikers and not the worry about catching up with them at the next town. It affords me a lot more freedom. I continue to meet awesome people on the trail. If you take the time to say hello and strike up a conversation it enhances your hike so much. The number of hikers has thinned tremendously. Just yesterday three hikers who were here decided to call it quits. Myself, I have zero plans to stop. Physically and mentally I have never felt stronger. My bond with God has only strengthened. My love for nature is through the roof. By the way, anyone who says Virginia is easy is lying. You may be at a lower elevation but the ups and downs are just as long and numerous. There does seem to be more switchbacks though. It is supposed to be a rainy week so I finally put a plastic bag inside my backpack. Everything got pretty wet last week and I don't want a repeat of that. Besides making life miserable it makes your pack very heavy. I mailed my winter gear and rain pants home today. Of course most of that weight was replaced with my fishing gear. Fair trade off in my book. I have also increased my food weight. Between the increase in mileage and heat I have lost a few more pounds. I really can't afford to lose to much more so I have added a lot more daily food. I also received a mail drop from my good friend Norm which included powdered multi-vitamin, energy, and hot chocolate drinks. They are great and don't weigh much. Perfect! Back on the trail tomorrow. Sure hope I find a nice trout stream, or two along the trail this week. Soaring Eagle","

No doctors or pretty nurses though. Just us hiker trash Warriorhikers. Had an event at the local VFW last night. Great food, free beer, and wonderful hospitality. Got caught in a flash flood Thursday night and damn near got washed away. I was tenting100 feet away from a creek and we had a really hard rain. Woke up at midnight and the water was roaring twenty feet away from my tent. A huge tree had fallen down fifty feet behind my tent and created a dam which diverted the water which literally saved my life. It was quite unnerving. I packed up everything but my tent and sat up all night watching the water. I was literally surrounded by water. By 8:00 the next morning the water had receded enough that I could get back on the trail. The trail in front of me was completely covered by water. Stayed at the Four Pines Hostel on Friday night so I was able to get my tent dry and sleep in comfort. The hike is going well. Still feel great physically and I know that God is watching over me and keeping me safe. My mental state has taken a little setback after the flood scare. When I woke up the night of the flood I could not see the tents of the other guys who were tenting closer to the water. I thought they had been washed away. I was frantic and screaming their names. Evidently, they had decided to move their tents a couple of hours earlier and all but one did not know where I was tented. I had come into camp late and set up while they were all in their tents. Why the guy who knew where I was did not wake me to move when they did is beyond me. It almost cost me my life. I am really upset with him. He even told me the next morning he knew my tent was there. I plan on keeping my distance from him. He is a coward and could only think of himself during the emergency. His lack of judgement and concern for his fellow man speaks volumes. Funny thing is this guy is constantly telling stories about how great he is. Getting back on the trail today and will stay the night in Daleville tomorrow night. Hiked over Dragon's Tooth on Friday.

Saw tons of slack packers this week going south down the big ups. Seems to be a few folks who take full advantage of this method of hiking. I must be a little crazy. I prefer to carry my pack every mile. This week was pretty easy. Started out from Cawtaba trailhead and did exactly one mile. A couple of guys had a little to much fun in Roanoke and needed to rest for the day. The next day we did 19 into Daleville. Took a zero on Wednesday with two other Warriorhikers.

Even went to see the movie A Million Ways To Die In The West. Very funny movie. First time I have been to a movie theater in nine years. My social anxiety from PTSD has prevented me from even considering it in the past. Guess the hike is helping to minimize some of my fears. Only had to hike 56 miles from Buena Vista where I took a zero as well. Hiked a two 21 milers and finished with a 14 to get here yesterday. Nice little town. Very hiker friendly. The first two days of hiking were tough. Started with a 2,000 foot climb on Tuesday followed by miles of up and downs. Tented at the Priest shelter. Saw my first rattlesnake on the way up to Priest shelter. Unfortunately, it was dead. Got to the shelter and some jerk told me he had killed it because the snake was aggressive. Really! You see a snake on the trail, in its environment, and you kill it because you thought it was aggressive . I guess he thought it was going to grow legs and chase him up the mountain. If he had time to find a rock and kill it, he certainly had time to take a few steps back and walk around it. Really made me mad, and sad. Also have been seeing a lot more animals. Mostly different types of squirrels, chipmunks, orange newts, and snakes. The hike out of Priest shelter was tough. Five miles down followed by a 3,000 foot climb. Still hiked 10 miles after that. I was pooped at the end of the day. Camped near a spring so I would have water to start my day. Water is sometimes scarce in Virginia and it is not uncommon to go 8 to 10 miles without a water source. Normally that is not a problem but, when you are doing a lot of ups you tend to consume more water. Yesterday spent the entire day hiking in the rain. Relatively easy day. Lost another Warriorhiker today. Down to 6. One of the guys fell on the slippery rocks and hurt his hip. Hopefully, he can go home and heal and will rejoin us. Just 142 miles and I will hit the 1,000 mile mark. Who would have ever thought it.

I never said anything negative about slack packers. I simply noted that I have seen quite a few. Not sure why you got all bent out of shape over it. If someone wants to slack pack then good for them. Personally, I don't see the sense in paying someone just so I don't have to carry my pack a few miles. I can find better things to do with my money. Obviously, you prefer the slack pack method. To Bluegill. I agree about carrying the fishing pole. With the Warriorhike schedule it is very hard to find the time to fish. My intentions were good but the reality is time is just not available. I will be sending my fishing rod home when I reach Front Royal on Friday. Cracker asked how many Warriorhikers we started with. The answer is 14. We are down to six. The individual who hurt his hip is rejoining us in two weeks. He went to his doctor and found out his hip was only bruised. He will finish the hike and return to Virginia after we finish to complete the section he missed. This has been an incredible week. The trails in the Shanendoahs are easy compared to the rest of the trail. Real easy grades and the hills are small. Have seen four bears and a lot of deer. Met one of the bravest women ever two nights ago at Loft Mountain campground. She is doing a section hike by herself. She is deaf and mute. To me that is incredible. Wish I knew how to sign. It would have been awesome spending some time conversing with her. Next week at this time I will have completed 1,000 miles. Almost halfway there. When I reach Pennsylvania I plan on pushing ahead and skipping the events. I have to come off the trail for 10 days starting 3 July to take care of some personal matters back home. My goal is to get 10 days ahead of the Warriorhikers so they will be where I get off the trail when I return. If they pass that spot before I return on the 13th then I will push a couple of days to catch up. I am not going to skip any of the trail. I don't want to come back and have to complete a section after Katahdin. The Warriorhike schedule is only 12-14 miles a day, as long as you take no zeros, so I think I can do it.

I ordered a new pair of Merrell Moabs which should last me through the second half of the hike. I will get to hike solo the last leg of the journey. I also bought some sealant to rainproof my tent and fly. It has been leaking pretty bad and is in desperate need of the sealant. I have gotten my winter gear together and will carry it the remainder of the trip. Going to try to walk a little today to try out my knee. Nothing to serious. Just a few miles without my pack. If it goes well I will start a daily exercise program to help strengthen my leg before I get back on the trail. I have decided to give up on the fishing experiment. Just not enough time with the Warriorhike schedule. Planning on avoiding any long days if possible to lesson the wear and tear on my legs. I should summit Katahdinon 12 September. Then we have a Warriorhike function on the 13th. After that everyone will head home, except me. I will still have about 350 miles to finish. Should be a lot easier hiking NY, NJ, and PA in September/October than right now.","

Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462651,"Cracker, here is the answer to your question about me being mentally spent. Enduring three weeks of walking on a bum leg, seven straight days of rain, and trying to keep to the Warriorhike schedule took all of the enjoyment out of the hike. My mood had soured and I was fighting my own self-induced negativity. I tried to work through it but finally decided I needed a change of environment and time to heal my leg if I had any chance of finishing the hike. I probably would not had come off the trail if my leg was okay. It is not. I strained the lateral collateral ligament and would have most likely caused even more damage had I continued to hike. I will get back on the trail in NY and give it a go. I started wearing a knee brace and spending lots of time off my legs. It is still extremely sore but I am hoping it will be ready to go on 13 July when I restart my hike. The plan now is to finish with the Warriorhikers and immediately go back to NY and hike south through PA. I will finish in mid October.","

In fact, if it wasn't for the fact that I have to housesit next week for my daughter I would be getting back on the trail next week. The break has been great and needed but, I am ready to go hiking. I ordered a new pair of Merrell's and reseated and waterproofed my tent. replaced the filter in my Katahdin water filter, packed my cold weather clothing in the pack, and cleaned my sleeping bag and liner. Boy, did they stink. When I rejoin the guys in NY I am going to feel like I am starting all over again. This time though I won't have to walk for a month until I get my hiking legs. I had a fellow Warriorhiker contact me yesterday and wants to hike with me in September when I make up the portion I have missed during my break. Cool. He is a really great guy and I enjoy his company a great deal. Should make the last leg oft journey even more memorable. He started the hike with me in March and we hiked together every day until he had to get off the trail. It will be awesome reuniting with him for a month. I am putting together food bags for each of the Warriorhikers to give them when I return. Even bought one of the guys a titanium coffee press. He had a glad one but it eventually got broken. This one should last him the remainder of the trip. The two Marines I hike with most of the time are big coffee drinkers. I noticed they are in a better mood when they have their coffee in the morning. Starts the days hike out in a better frame of mind. This is a win/win. Nothing worse than a couple of grumpy Marines in the morning. :-)   They are absolutely two of the best people I have come to know on the trail. And they don't have quit in them. It is going to be some kind of honor submitting Katahdin with them. Actually, that goes for all of the Warriorhike guys. Feeling very blessed. God has answered my prayers and is making sure my body will be prepared for the second half of this journey.","

Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471502,"It's official. Going back on the trail on 12 September to finish my hike. The surgery was a great success and my surgeon (who is a hiker) says go for it. The only pain in my knee now is from the swelling, fluid, and incisions. He did an awesome job. Same surgeon who repaired my left knee last year. He gives me confidence and I believe in his judgment 100%. He assures me my knee is now structurally sound and I should have no problems with it . I am sure it will be a little sore the first couple of weeks out, but I will just suck it up, grit my teeth, and take some Ibuprofen.I am absolutely giddy with excitement. I had hoped things would turn out this way but never really expected it.My plan is to hike Katahdin on 12 September with my Warriorhike pals and then immediately start hiking south. Unlike the first half, I plan on going slower and doing less miles. No more consecutive 20 mile days and no more 3 1/2 mile pace. I am going to take my sweet ass time and suck in every second of it. Lots of pictures this time, lot less zero days, and more time enjoying the ride. No schedule, no events, no one to be responsible for but myself. Exactly the way I want it. Time to repack the gear, fill up the gas tank, and head to Maine. Yeah for me! Thank you God for giving a chance to finish what I started in March. Soaring Eagle","

If you have ever done a long distance hike then you know pain is part of the deal. I am comforted knowing my knee is structurally sound. Right now it is just swollen and sore, but getting better every day. Going to do a few miles today and see how it responds. If all goes well then tomorrow I will throw on my pack and try a few more miles. I have no illusions. I know this is going to be really tough. I also know this is something my heart yearns and my resolve is very strong. Mentally, I feel as strong as ever. Physically, only time will tell. My hope is if I proceed slowly the first couple of weeks my knee will strengthen and I can complete my journey. I put it in God's hands and will accept whatever his plans are for me. My pack is ready for the most part. Just need to buy my food and a gas canister. I have decided to go back to my original gear instead of the Warriorhike sponsored gear. The Warriorhike gear is great, I just like mine a little better. Plus mine is a little lighter. Pack is going to be heavy to start as I will be starting in the 100 mile woods. I like the idea of going south as it gives me a different perspective. Can't wait until Thursday and seeing my Warriorhike pals. They are currently in the 100 mile woods and will soon get a view of Katahdin. We started on 17 March and they have hiked a great hike. My only regret is not being able to hike the last 1,100 miles with them. They will be lifelong friends. One of the guys lives two hours from me and will be driving my truck home from Maine. Solves my vehicle problem (didn't want to leave it in Maine for 2 1/2 months) and resolves his ride home from Maine issue. Win/win! Hope he is a good driver, it is a new truck. :-)I will update my journal as I get internet service on the trail. Not sure how often that will be in Maine and NH. Hope you all have a wonderful Autumn.

I went to Mount Katahdin on 12 September and attempted to hike Katahdin with my Warriorhike pals. They finished their thru hike on that day. Unfortunately, my right knee is still not healed well enough to continue my thru hike. I made it to about 3,500 feet before the pain and fear of causing another injury forced me to turn around. It was a prudent decision and one that I know was right. Had to do the walk of shame alone coming off the mountain. Totally devastating, but also very motivating. I will be at Springer next March and will try again. No regrets, I had a great journey even if it was not the end result I had dreamed off. Good thing is the mountains are not going anywhere, I can now hike solo, and I already know what to expect during the first 1,100 miles.God's will is God's will and that fact comforts me.

I will be starting at Gathland State Park in Maryland and hiking north. I know, I know, it's going to be cold. Nothing good gear and a little common sense can't take care of. Plan on being very flexible and if the weather dictates I will come off the trail to wait out storms and excessively cold cold fronts. I am starting at Gathland because that is where I got off the trail last year and want to see the part of the trail I have not seen yet. If all goes well I will return to Gathland after summiting Katahdin and hike south to Springer. Yep, going to try a flip-flop. I am also planning on trying an ENO hammock on the second half of the hike. To damn cold to try a hammock on the first half. I have never used a hammock before. Really looking forward to the experience. I will most likely not be updating here much. Last year it just seemed to become a little labor intensive. When you get time in town and off the trail for a night you really just want to relax. Well, after you shower, do your laundry, and eat eat eat. Good luck fellow hikers. Happy trails!Soaring Eagle","

Soaring Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481424,"Finished changing out some gear and the pack is packed and ready to go. I switched out my Katahdin water filer for a Sawyer Squeeze. Much lighter and more reliable. While I didn't have any problems with the Katahdin I did see a couple break and a few that would clog so quickly they were not worth having. Everyone I know who started with the Katahdin switched over to either the Sawyer or drops.   I also added a pair of crampons. I know there will be snow and ice for at least the first month of my trek. The added weight is worth the help in preventing a fall and possible hike ending injury. As soon as I can I will send them home. I also elected to go with the loose page edition of AWOL's guide. I found it to be cumbersome last year constantly fumbling with the book. This year I will just carry the pages I need for the day in my pocket. I always try to figure out how far I want to hike each day and where water is available. Having quick and easy access to the pages will make my hike that much easier. It's always nice to know how much further you have to go to your next water. I also changed out my rechargeable battery pack. I really like the one I carried last year that I purchased at Mountain Crossing in Neel Gap. Unfortunately, so did my daughter. I will be using a mophie this year. Hope it stands up well to the elements. I will be wearing Merrell Moabs again. Love them. I am starting with the gortex style but will switch over once the weather breaks. My underlayer is Under Armor 2.0. I have the 3.0 but don't want the additional weight. Pretty sure I will need them all the way to Maine with my early start date. I started using toe socks last year as an under layer for my socks. I wear a pair of Smartwool socks over them. I did the same last year and it pretty much alleviated blisters. The toe socks are great if you get blisters between your toes. In fact, that is why I initially tried them. Going with the same Big Agnes Seedhouse 2L tent and Marmot 15 degree bag. Love my jetboil stove. Wouldn't use anything else. It is definitely on board. My trekking poles are the Black Diamond Carbon Cork Handled. Really like them a great deal. Also still using the Thermarest inflatable mattress. Still no holes in it. Keeping my fingers crossed. I have the Big Agnes inflatable as a backup that can be sent to me if the Big Agnes goes south. That's about it. I am not taking anything I don't need or won't use. Other items I am bringing are my cell phone, Fujifilm camera, Black Diamond headlamp, small Swiss Army knife, and one pair of pants and shorts, socks, rain gear (Marmot jacket), and marmot down jacket. A Smartwool balaclava, and North Face gloves. There, that's it. :-)Counting the days. 17 to go.","

The weather has been pretty brutal in the Northeast and considering the fact that I am starting in Maryland and hiking north I thought it would be prudent to wait for the weather pattern to shift. Don't mind hiking in the snow or the temps in the 20s/30s, but to go out with the temps consistently hovering around zero and below is not smart. I don't have a death wish and the mountains are not going anywhere. When the weather permits, I'll be hiking. Added a titanium coffee cup and a coffee press that works with my jetboil. Just need to pick up some more food, and a knee brace and I 'm ready to roll. Looking forward to getting back on the trail and away from all the craziness in the world.

It is with that in mind that I am approaching this attempt at a thru hike. In the past I would hike fast and long. Twenty mile days became the norm. While they are great if you are on a schedule or have limited time, I have found they are mostly just exhausting and lower my chances at a successful thru hike. This year the 3-31/2 mile an hour is out. Nothing faster than 2 miles and hour, and no rushing on the downs. Downhills are torture on the knees and experience tells me the quickest way to end your hike is to rush down hill. This year's hike will be at a leisurely pace and with a complete sense of free will. My only plan is to get to Springer. From there to Katahdin I am completely winging it. No food drops, no bounce box, no expectations, and no stress. It will be six months of pure bliss, mixed with a lot of sweat, pain, hunger, and exhaustion. Can't wait. Having gone through three knee surgeries in the past three years, and then laying in bed all last year with back issues, I surprisingly feel pretty good. I've been walking five miles a day, and will be carrying my pack starting today. I won't be in the best shape of my life when I start the trail but I know the trail will get me in shape.

I also like the thought that the number of hikers will have decreased significantly by the time I get back to Harper's Ferry to hike to Maine. Counting the days until I start. Itching to go.

When I got out of the truck at the vets it was raining and a beautiful double rainbow was in the sky. He passed peacefully in my arms. It was incredibly heartbreaking, but it was time. I have my ride all set to Duncannon on Thursday. I hope to get there early enough to hike the 5 miles to the first shelter. Glad I am starting where I am. It will give me some relatively easy terrain at the start and a chance to slowly get in shape. So looking forward to getting back on the trail. The past two years have not been kind to me physically. It feels great to have all body parts working the way they are supposed to work. Hoping it stays that way for this 2,200 mile journey. Happy trails. I'll update when I get down the trail a bit. Soaring Eagle.","
