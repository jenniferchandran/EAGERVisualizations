Mike Tetreault,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555387,"The final step into making my dream a reality has been completed; I have informed my work that I will be leaving in order to take on the AT. Exactly one month from now will be my last day until I prepare to leave for Georgia. Butterflies filled my stomach; whether from nerves or excitement I am unsure, but it now feels real. The stressing over whether or not to go is gone and now begins the stressing over what to pack, what to leave home, planning package pick ups, saying my goodbyes - the list goes on.Not sure what will happen with work when I finish, but that is something to worry about when I am done. Now is a time to let my feelings take over. It's time to enjoy the process leading up to the beginning, take everything in and get out there and live.   ",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Wed",0
Mike Tetreault,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556174,"Food prep: Not the easiest part of the process. I have the smoker running to make jerky, but it is a long ordeal for each 3lb batch. I have found that trying to find types of food that I (hopefully) will not get sick of quickly, but also gives me a good amount of calories/protein/fiber, is not so hard. It helps that I love peanut butter - already eat globs of it a day and never tire of it. Then there are the protein bars, ensure powder, oatmeal, dried veggies and dog food. That's right! Ghost's pack finally came in and we can start his training!""What are you going to do about Ghost's food?"" A question I get every time I bring up that my dog will be joining me on the trail.My answer is quite simple, ""If he wants to eat, he will carry his own food."" This is no free ride! He is an 80lb, lean, muscle machine. He will do just fine carrying his own belongings. In fact, it'll be good for him. But for now, I will get him used to the backpack and harness combination, check for irritation and adjust to make the experience as comfortable for him as I can. The next month will be gearing him up for when we will be in full hike mode.   ",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Sun",0
Mike Tetreault,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556142,"With only 3 weeks left before hitting the trail, I have sold the ATV. This puts me in the financial position to complete a thru hike. The money I made will be put to paying the bills while I am gone as well as food along the way. I am relieved to have the money to back myself up at home while I'm away hiking. It is one more thing to check off the list, but more importantly it's one more thing I can stop stressing over.With my list of items needed dwindling, it's finally starting to turn from ""crap, I still need this and this and this"" to ""hmm, I wonder just how many days it'll take for me to not want oatmeal for breakfast."" I'm sure the answer is ""not many"", but at least Im more focussed on the happenings of the trail rather than the stressful preparations. I am still extremely excited and look forward to the last few weeks - hoping and praying it isn't 17 degrees in Georgia like it is here at home!",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Sat",0
Mike Tetreault,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557069,"Less than two weeks away now before it's off to Georgia. I had a successful weekend of prep work; pack is set, dog pack is ready and adjusted to his liking and packaging provisions has commenced. With the pack crammed full (seams screaming), the nerves are filling up within me as full as my pack. The first few weeks of prep have been pure excitement. Gathering everything I am going to need for the next four to five months has kept my mind busy. However, now that most everything is in order, the moment of realization hits, ""I am going to be gone for four to five months!""Then my mind starts racing and the questions start rapid firing:""Do I have everything? Am I going to be able to actually walk over 2000 miles? Is Ghost going to be able to walk over 2000...yes, he'll be fine. Food, I'm going to be so hungry. I love food. How am I going to live on such short supply?""The list of concerns goes on and on. As my mind continues to spit out question after question, I keep thinking of some advice my cousin Leki-less gave me.""Don't try to plan everything out before you get out there. Things happen out on the trail that are out of your control. If you have it all planned out and things don't go your way that's when you get discouraged. You'll figure it all out when you get out there.""I appreciate the advice and try to listen as best I can, but honestly, it'seems easier said than done. I'm trying to stay calm and not let the nerves get the better of me, but I'm only human. It is not to say that I'm still not overly excited to get out there, it's just only now it's a combination of the two emotions: excitement and nervousness.",,Nerves,"Mar 20, Mon",0
Mike Tetreault,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558488,"Last day of work - a bittersweet feeling. Decided I was going to work a half day today since the drive to Savanah is sixteen and a half hours and plan to do it in one shot.However, what's that mother nature? You want to throw a noreaster at New England for my final day; I wish this was an April fools joke!Not even on the trail yet and plans are changing. Woke up for 430am and tried to leave the house for 5. Now instead of working to lunch as intended, it's go clean out my locker, say bye to my favorite monkey and get out of here before the whole city freezes over. 730: Everything is pack. Quick stop at Dunkins and Caroline, Ghost and I are off. Slipping and sliding through MA and CT, we are happy with the decision to leave when we did. After reaching NY, it was clear skies and stressless passengers the rest of the way. Sixteen hours is a long time to be in a car for anyone, but for a super active pup whose longest time in a car before this was only three hours, it's torture. Nap. ""Are we there yet?"" Nap. ""Can we get out now and chase squirrels?"" Nap, eat some of dad's sandwhich, nap again. 8 oclock hits and the naps turn into the finale - Ghost is down for the remainder of the drive. Finally, I can eat my candy without drool running down my neck!Fourteen hours in and the playlist Caroline made is still going strong. Singing along with Britney Spears, following the sign that says 272 miles to Savanah and battling my eyelids to stay open, we go on. She does offer to switch and drive for a little, which was nice. When I refused and said I was okay, fifteen minutes later I looked over to see a sleeping copilot. I was happy with my decision. Hour fifteen was the longest, but after getting through that, the rest of the way I had the adrenaline pumping and cruised over the bridge to beautiful Savanah, Georgia. Only ten past twelve we reached Caroline's friend's place, where we will be staying until Monday before driving to the beginning of the trail in Gainsville.Time to rest and relax for the next few days. There is no knowing when the next time I'll be staying with the comfort of a bed or taking a hot shower. After a long drive and day like we had, a little rest and relaxation is much needed.",,Final Day of Work,"Apr 01, Sat",0

Mike Tetreault,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559666,"It only took two days for me to find that this trail is not what I need, nor what I want. The first day was full of nerves and excitement. I left the thru-hiker sign-in booth excited and ready for an epic adventure with the dog. A few miles in and we've been passing hikers with ease. We didn't take many breaks that first day; we were done the first and most strenuous part of the day (8.8 miles up to Mt. Springer) by lunchtime. We decided to walk more. Why not? There's nothing else to do but to walk. The next part of the trail being downhill I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to keep going. After going three miles I decided to look at the map to find that the next area to stop is another four miles away. At this point my feet hurt, my sides from where my bag had been pushing into me all day are sore to the touch, and I'm getting tired and hungry for food. After a long grueling four miles, Ghost and I make it to the site. It's 18:15, so I set up the tent and get the site situated, while Ghost growls at every hiker that comes close and tries to say hi; not characteristic of him at all. He had been doing it during the day when hikers would be off in the distance, but now he is getting noisy even when he sees them close. With camp all set it's finally time to eat. I am so tired I don't even want to move and no longer am hungry. I tell myself I have to eat something, so I hike a quarter mile to the spring to get water in order to boil to make mac and cheese. After eating, I crawled into the tent around 20:00 and laid down for bed. Woke up the next day knowing it was supposed to rain. So far nothing, thunder in the distance, but no rain. I ate breakfast, again not feeling hungry, and packed my things. As I packed the last thing away a raindrop hit my bag. I pulled the rain gear out, put the rain cover over the bag, and was on my way. The rain started off light. Not too bad, I can do this for a while. Then about a mile and a half in, the skies opened up and showed me what rain really is. Pounding down on Ghost, the trees, my rain suit, the trail: everything, we continue onward. Up and down, up and down, in between gap after mountain gap. The rain is turning the path into a mini river to forge. Finally making it to a shelter, we stop to get dry and eat lunch. It has been raining nonstop all morning. The shelter is crowded already, but room was made for the two of us and we stepped under to get out of the rain. However, we didn't stay long. Ghost growled at every newcomer that came. Plus, nobody is a fan of wet dog but what is worse is a wet, dirty dog. So feeling unwelcome, we ventured off to try to get another 5.5 miles away to Woody Gap.The ranger at the shelter told us it's not a bad hike, just one hill to get over and you're there. What this ranger forgot to mention was that this ""hill"" was not just a hill, but many hills leading up to a big hill. The trail was getting much worse at this point in the day. Slipping down slopes, catching myself with trees to not fall, I start thinking this is not fun.The whole 5.5 miles to Woody Gap, the three and a half hour journey, I contemplated why I was out there. What happens if I make it all the way? Am I going to even feel any sort of accomplishment? Is this a huge waste of time? Is the dog going to stop being aggressive and act normal? Question after question. Then, the ultimate question: Am I even having fun and enjoying myself? Am I even having fun? Hmm, when I thought about it the answer was simple. No, I am not. It's day two, the days where excitement and awe are supposed to be taking over, I am here thinking and only thinking ""when can I stop?"" It was with this inner conversation I decided that this trail is not for me.I made a few calls, talked it over a few times, and with my mind not swayed in any other direction than to get the hell out of there, I made arrangements to be picked up the next day. 30.4 miles and I was done. Part of me tells me it would be different without the dog, but most of me says that it still was not for me. Backpacking and camping are much different than the AT. It's a mental commitment I just wasn't able to make. I will say, even though I was only out there for a short time, I do believe it's going to lead to something great. I was forced to leave my job, so I have time now to focus on finding what I really want to be doing. And even though I only was there a short time, I do not feel discouraged. I am proud I tried it; it was the only way to truly know whether it was worth doing or not. To everyone looking to read a fun, epic tale I apologize. There will be nothing such here. I thank you all for the support and make sure to look out for me, this is not the end.- Mike Aka: Boston","Woody Gap
