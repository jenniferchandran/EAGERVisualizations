Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551928,"Good Day,    I have been thinking about the Appalachian Trail now for about a year. I had my first opportunity to see what it feels like since I made the decision to do the trail. June of this year, I took a vacation to Asheville NC for a few days. More specifically, Around the Bakersville area. Besides seeing the beautiful Biltmore Estates, I took a hike up Roan Mountain.    I am around 300lbs when I decided this but it sure was worth it in the end. I had no idea how out of shape I was but I made sure to complete it. My biggest fear is running out of water so I brought around 5 liters just for this. More than enough but I have not hiked this heavy or this much in over 10 years so better safe than sorry.     Up until now, I didn't have any of the gear I needed for the trail and now I understand having the proper gear makes all the difference. Sure it was just a day hike but my little backpack killed my back and my shoes were in no shape to hike even a little bit of Roan Mountain. I quickly went to REI after this little hike and fixed these issues.    If the trail brings the views like Roan Mountain did, It will be hard to sleep until March 2017!",,View Entry,"Jun 05, Sun",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551930,"Good Day All,    I have decided to take another vacation but this time, It will be in my hometown in the Adirondacks of NY. Haystack Mountain this time around was calling my name.    Still being overweight, I had no idea how much stress this mountain would put me through. A couple months have passed since Roan Mountain in NC. I have purchased myself the Osprey Atmos 65L pack and the 3L water reservoir that goes with it. Also, the Sawyer Mini in case of water shortage. The first 3/4 of the mountain were ok. Not brutal, but definitely a workout. It was not until the final 1/4 that most of the mountain was steep.     Reaching the top with maybe only drinking a liter of water and a pack full of snacks and sandwiches, I thought I had done well. It was not until I had rested at the top that my body felt like it was shutting down. My body was pushed too much and I still had a long way back down. We rested at the top for a good 45mins. The other 2 liters of water and a liter through the Mini Sawyers were not helping at all. I had the remaining liquids with about 30mins left of hiking. I had stopped sweating. My hands were getting swollen. I knew I was dehydrated. I had left a bottle of water in the vehicle. It was calling my name. It was too late though. I could not eat or keep any liquids down at this point. I had a very long night of being sick.     Again, My worst fear of the trail is being with no water. Hopefully the weight loss will assist me with how much I have to intake but this was surely a lesson learned. I do not care how much the water weighs. I will always bring enough.",,View Entry,"Sep 08, Thu",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551927,"Good Evening Folks,    Well the decision has been made. I will be doing the Appalachian Trail in March of 2017.     I first found out about this journey in the late months of 2015 along with this website. It is amazing how much someone does not know about something until you come by it by mistake. Following this website and people's journeys, I found multiple videos of complete thru hikes. Red Beard comes to mind as well as BetweenTheBlazes. I have binge watched all the movies out there involving the trail and other trails such as the PCT. I am in the process of reading all of the possible books now.     Here I am now at 28 years old. Growing up in the Adirondack Mountains of NY, I have always loved the outdoors. Whether it was fishing, hunting, or camping you could not keep me inside. The family would hike every weekend until a suitable spot was found to camp. I remember the best places as being near hidden lakes and ponds. In the campgrounds, I would capture squirrels with a pot and a stick. It actually works!     Up until the end of high school, I had a simple life. For the next 2 years, I lived what I thought was a normal life. A 40 hour work week with the daily stresses of now bills and food. It was all fine but I felt like my life was going no where and had no way of improving. I lived in a very small city of maybe 5k people. Progress was slow in a city like this. Still considering myself as an old ""kid,""I did not know what was best for me. It was just work and sleep while what I loved to do was put on hold.    20 years old in the summer of 2008, hopping from job to job not satisfied and being pissed off and betrayed at the world for what now seems like nonsense, I decided to join the Marine Corps. It was by far the biggest decision I made and a choice that was left to me because my best friend at the time who convinced to join backed out at the last second. I stuck with it for the longest and hardest 3 months of my life. Dont let the TV sugarcoat anything you see. It was by far much worse but so much more rewarding in the end and I would not change a thing about it. Weighing 180lbs and being 6'3, I considered myself skinny. At the end of the 3 months, I was a whopping 160lbs. Much skinnier but toned and never felt so great. I was stationed in NC and have been here since.     Forward another 2 years. I am married and loving life. How quickly life changes. I am sick and losing my mind. I have what is called chronic epididymitis. If you wish to know more about that topic, google will say everything. I ended up getting the left side removed and in the process getting nerve damage which in turn, affects me to this day. There is usually a constant pain and feeling like getting kicked in the balls. More of a phantom pain.     Not being able to return the the military life at 24, I was medically separated in 2012. I stuck around NC looking for a job. To no avail, I decided to take advantage of the time spent in the Marines and went off to college for computers. Life continues to let me down. I am depressed over everything from the past and the pain limits what my body can do and than the unthinkable. I walk into my place to my now ex wife cheating on me.     I push on and continue college for a year up until I get a phone call from a Marine I used to work with. I was offered a job at the place I worked in the Marines. Life has finally seemed to turn around. I put college on hold and took the job. I have been there since. Working a comfortable desk job that allows the continuing pain to be not so severe and let me live my life.    My weight continued to swell up and down until September of this year... I got up over 300lbs! This year I took a vacation both to the mountains of NC and back home in NY. I wanted to get back out there and enjoy nature and life. I chose to hike the whole time in both areas up and down mountains. The feeling of freedom it gave me made me think that the Appalachian Trail would be a smart choice to further improve my life and clear my head of the last 8 years of negativity. I may have the job and live a comfortable life but I still feel like I am just going through the notions where no advancement can happen and am at a place where my past keeps coming up.     Since September, I am down 30 lbs and continue to lose at a fast rate. It is to be expected since there is a lot to lose and I do not expect to be 100% by March, but I will not give up and the trail will further improve me and my outlook on life. There is really no finish date at this point except it will be completed fully next year. My health comes first. I do apologize for the long introduction. This is a new chapter of my life and I am so excited to be apart of all of this with this community. Thanks for who stuck around",,View Entry,"Nov 28, Mon",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552037,"    So I was face to face with a bear the other night while in my car and it got me thinking about my hike and how I am petrified of them. I have only ever seen a few but my first encounter as a kid did enough damage mentally to make me scared.    I am well aware that the chances of meeting a bear on the trail is near 100%. I know of what to do when this eventually happens but it does not make me happy. When it happens, I hope to have a new appreciation of the animal and overcome my fears. One bad encounter shouldn't swear me off for life otherwise I would never experience anything in life.    Water and Heights are the other fears. Its the amount of water I will have to carry to concerns me. From previous hikes, at my weight I need to drink more water to keep dehydration away. As the pounds melt away, the amount I need to consume will lessen.     As for heights, its more of a as long as I pay attention to my surroundings, I will be fine. I would hate to be hiking and slip down something steep causing serious injury. I will have my trekking poles and can not decide on decent trail runners yet.     I have researched many and have seen different opinions about waiting up until the trail to buy them and break them in on the trail. The other opinion being buying sooner rather than later to get a good feel and buying bigger for the swelling of your feet.",,View Entry,"Dec 02, Fri",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552206,"    Time has been flying and now there is exactly 3 months until the start of the trail. I will be 29 since my birthday is March 4th. The girlfriend is taking the birthday weekend off with me and will drive me down to hang out for a few days.     I still have a few things of gear I have to decide on. For the sleeping bag, I am pretty set on the Enlightened Equipment Revelation bag down to 20F. I just need to order it and wait for it to be made. Current wait time is 7-9 weeks so I will need to hurry.    The tent is where I am having issues. I can not decide between a 1 or 2 person tent and than cant decide on the REI Quarter Domes or the Big Agnes Copper Spur. I can get a 15% discount on the REI version for signing up for email offers so that equals to about $30 to $40 in savings.     The rain coat has surpassed my expectations. The last two days in the Carolinas has done nothing but rain. I have stayed dry the whole time. I do think I will need to buy another by the time it is ready to hike. I originally bought a 3XL size in September and am now wearing just XL shirts.",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Tue",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552402,"    Good Morning Everyone!    So I decided that the tent I was going to live in on the hike was the REI Quarter Dome 2. I read a lot that everyone with a 1 person tent eventually went back and got a 2 person tent for the extra room especially for the rainy days if you are stuck inside of the tent. It was on sale already and the extra 15% off for signing up with REI made this a done deal for me. From my understanding the new models come out next year (hence the sale) but the reviews made it seem like a no brainer.    I did order my Enlightened Equipment sleeping bag as well. The garage sale of the site only had 1 sleeping bag at the moment that would have fit but I was not liking the color combination and for the same price, I just ended up custom ordering it. Not a big deal since I will have time to test it out. I don't expect to be returning it.     The only ""expensive"" items I have left to choose are the trekking poles and sleeping pad. Been doing research but still haven't decided. Any ideas let me know. Would rather hear thoughts from hear than other websites.    Continuing to lose weight. I am trying to wait until the last second for my clothing needs. I ended up donating all of my big clothes this weekend. I ended up with 3 large trash bags full of clothes. It was a good time for that because I am also moving to a new place so that's less I have to haul.    ",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Mon",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552521,"Good Morning Everyone,    I am one step further to starting my journey. I spent all weekend moving in with the girlfriend. The weather cooperated and was warm but it was humid both days causing a lot of sweating. I never could stand humidity. Being in North Carolina for 7 years and I am still not used to it haha.     I did setup the tent in the bedroom a few days ago and slept in it. I see being a slide sleeper could leave me at a disadvantage. I didn't use a sleeping pad yet but I did have a comfy carpet and a body pillow to sleep on. My hips still hurt. Eventually, I was exhausted enough and fell asleep on my back. Hopefully I will be so fatigued at the end of the day, I can continue to sleep on my back. For a tent being 90in long, I felt like my feet or head were always touching the tent. Never at the same time but I guess I tend to move a lot during the night for now I am thankful for getting the weather stripes for my sleeping bag for when condensation is present.",,View Entry,"Dec 19, Mon",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552560,"Good Morning Folks,    For the briefest of moments the last couple days, I felt like I almost regretted my decision. This didn't make sense to me because it is a life goal of mine and the opportunity has presented itself. It all started with my job. Being offered more job security. An extra extension to the contract and a raise in pay will make anyone question there motives.     It was not until I had to sit down and outweigh the pros and cons and think about the future. I believe this desk job is slowly killing me. I need to be moving around. I kept reading quotes about how I shouldn't fear the unknown but rather take the risk and go for it. I mean I have options for when I come back. I wont have the current job but I can always go back to school using my GI bill. I have seen people pick up jobs right after the trail. It is not like I have nothing for when I return.     THE TRAIL IS STILL ON!",,View Entry,"Dec 22, Thu",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552697,"Good Morning,    Hope everyone had a great holiday. Spent most of mine unpacking into the new place and looking for gear deals online. Received my thru hike registry letter in the mail on the 24th. Though not mandatory, to me, it solidified my place in the 2017 class of hikers.    As for the gear, I wanted to focus on my sleeping pad as it is one of my last big purchases. I have been doing research on this one for a while and had to take into consideration I am a side sleeper and on the bigger side right now weight wise being 265lb now (Down 40lbs in 3.5 months!) I went with the Klymit Static V Luxe. The width and length is perfect for me especially being 6ft 3. I blew it up last night to do a quick test run. I was not disappointed. Fully blown, the pad is 3in. Not once did my shoulder or hip touch the ground. This was important to me at this stage because I will still be considered overweight when I start the trail and want to be as comfortable as possible. After a long day though, I can see blowing this up will be a pain in the ass due to the extra width and length. I love my sleep so this is a luxury item and one of my heavier ones at 26.5oz. My dry weight of the pack should still be around 20lbs.    Also, I went with the GSI Pinnacle Soloist Outdoor cookware and bought an extra long spork for my meals with the deep pouches. The cup and pot is really all I will need since I will only be using it to heat hot water for my meals and tea/coffee. I didn't see a point to adding extra weight with the bigger sets that include more pots and such so the weight should hover around 11oz including the spork.     Still waiting on my quilt from Enlightened Equipment. Can not wait for this since I keep reading and watching reviews on this. There is a gameland 10mins away that allows camping in certain spots so a weekend test run of all my gear is imminent before March.",,View Entry,"Dec 27, Tue",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552868,"Hope everyone had an awesome new year!    Spent mine recovering from a detergent allergy and finishing my gear list. I spent a good 3 hours at REI with my patient girlfriend. I shouldn't say patient because it allowed her to play her pokemon go ""rolls eyes."" It was also our 1 year anniversary. Overall great day .    Back to REI. I wanted to wait a bit longer to finish my gear list just because of the clothes and losing weight thing. I am predicting at least 20 more pounds to lose before March 6th. Most of my time spent in the store was trying things on and predicting its fit. I ended up going with REI CO-OP gear mostly due to the cost compared to bigger brands. I am happy with the results and have every layer covered. I did go to Walmart and pick up some basic wicking t shirts. By the time I had checked out of REI, a bill of $750 had shined brightly on the register. I wanted to cry. I can see how total costs before the trip even starts adds up. From what I have read, It puts me on par with what people usually spend on gear unless its used.    I still have to take most things out of the packaging which will shed weight but I have a base weight of 23 pounds. A little heavier than I wanted but I can break down certain things like the first aid kit for the essentials. I don't see myself needing 2 fuel canisters at once so that saves another 8 oz. By the time I break things down and get my quilt in the mail, I think the weight will stay the same around 23 pounds. I need to practice putting everything where it goes in the pack. As of now, I still need to make room for where the food will fit along with the quilt.     I have 60 days until my launch date. I will be in Georgia that weekend to celebrate my 29th birthday March 4th. I am confident everything will be in good shape before I hit the approach trail to Springer. I am trying to not over plan and stress. I am just ready to do this and start a new chapter.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Tue",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553111,"Good Afternoon Everyone,    I could have sworn I had more time left before my hike. Feels like I was just looking down at my countdown timer and saw 99 days left. In reality, I have 54 days left. I am so anxious at this point that my remaining work schedule is just dragging by.     It is not like I am over planning anything. I still have a couple things left to pack up and get. My biggest issue is what to do about a bear bag or canister. I can not for the life of me decide on which to go with. Im swinging more towards the canister for more protection against wildlife. I know it is heavier. I also know this is not going to be my last hike and even though there is only like a 5 mile part of the AT where they are required, other hikes will require them in the future. Its funny because they are basically useless in my home country in the Adirondacks because of one bear that figured out how to get into canisters. Though that particular bear is no longer alive, rumors have spread that others bears know the trick in my home area.     Other reasons I am considering the canister include the fact that I am in absolutely no rush to complete the trail. It will be done in 2017. That is all that matters. I wont be staying in towns unless of injury. I found a top 10 list of cities to stay in so I may consider that. Too many variable but I want to say low zero days. I researched gps trackers. I could technically put one in the canister in case of anything stealing it and track it down by my phone. They have a tracking distance of like 200ft though so hopefully whatever could take it gives up haha.     I took everything out of the packaging this weekend dealing with my new gear. In all, I shaved off 1.5lbs of waste bringing my pack to 20lbs with no food or water. My pack is the heaviest at about 5lbs. I could shed off maybe 3.5lbs if I switched to something like a zpacks haul. My big 3 weighs under 10lbs. My external battery pack is 20,000mah but weighs 1lb. It would charge my phone over 4 times before needing to be recharged and the phone in airplane mode, I can get 4-5 days per charge. To me, that means less time in towns at the cost of weight.",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554040,"Good Day Everyone,        It has been a while and it has been official. I put in my 2 week notice today. There has been nothing much to say about the progress of the hike up until the last couple days. I have finally finished gathering the gear I will need to do the trail last weekend. Also, I was able to test out my whole setup with the cooler temps last weekend and I am glad I did.         My Enlightened Equipment quilt came in last week. I was super excited for it but soon realized I had no idea how to properly use it. I had assumed I was just going to use it like a sleeping bag but even the wide version I got was not going to work properly as it let it too much cold air with just the clips holding each side together. I was concerned because I had no idea how else to use it. Thankfully I was able to go onto their website and see other means of using the quilt. I actually like the process I learned a whole lot better than using it as a sleeping bag anyways. I can wrap it around my sleeping pad with the included straps to give me an airtight seal to prevent cold air from entering the sides. It also keeps me on my pad so as a side sleeper, I will not be falling off through the nights tossing and turning.        So I had to test everything out to make sure I made the right gear choices. The tent was easy to setup even in the wind. The only issue I had was with the rumored oversized footprint that proved to be true. It did not want to connect to the tent properly so I ended up just leaving it unhooked underneath for more protection. I may try an idea out that I have not read about or found anything on. It consists of cutting of the footprint to fit or getting a Tyvek sheet and using Velcro strips to connect it to the bottom of the tent so when I disassemble everything, I just have to pull off the footprint and stuff it away rather than connect it to poles. I realize that the Velcro will eventually get dirty and not have a good hold.         So as night fell, the temperature fell to about the freezing point. I lay there on the sleeping pad comfortable and really warm in my quilt. I was just wearing a pair of gym shorts and a t-shirt. After about 20 minutes, I realized my sleeping pad was not going to work out. My pressure points were freezing from where I made the most contact with the pad. That led to my whole body eventually being cold. The pad was also too wide to create a seal so every time I moved; a blast of air came in. I am glad I tested everything just in my yard. I considered the test a fail and 45mins later, I was back inside in my bed doing research for a new pad. The quilt worked wonders though.        The original pad was a Klymit Static V Luxe. It had a low R-value to begin with(1.3 I think) but I thought it wouldn’t pose that much of an issue. Apparently, it is more of a 2 season pad but the 30in width and 78in length sold me along with the $100 price tag. I was in REI a couple hours away the next day to correct my mistake. I ended up with the Big Agnes Q Core SLX pad long wide edition. I will be testing this setup this weekend but it feeling better already in my indoor test connected with my quilt. This pad is supposed to be good to 15F which is better for the cold weather to come in early March.        I also ended up getting a bear canister. I don’t care what people will say. Especially since the ATC recommends a bear canister this year on the website. It puts my mind at ease. My fear of bears goes down a little bit also. Reading that people sleep with their food and lazily hang their bags makes it even smarter to me. There are pros and cons to each method out there but I am fine with a little extra weight. It is not a race. HYOH and enjoy yourself. It took me a bit to figure out how to stuff it all in my pack but my Osprey Atmos 65 does it and allows me to lay my canister down horizontally at the very top easily. It also becomes a chair so it does offer more than just projection against bears and critters. In total, my pack weighs 25lbs so I am looking at maybe a 40lb pack. Still very much doable but I am not done with my shakedown yet. Everything I keep in my pack now allows me to stay out of towns longer other than food which in turn, saves more money. Also, I would rather zero for free at a nice campsite than in town where you can blow your budget if you are not careful. I will post my entire setup this weekend.         My starting day is still March 6th and it cannot come soon enough. It is all I can think about. The plan is still to be in GA the weekend before for my birthday on March 4th. Not sure if I want a hotel or to use VRBO for those 2 nights.        ",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Wed",0
Travis ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555509,"Good Evening Everyone,    Well this is it. The last night before I take off for my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. My last day of work was 2 weeks ago and ended on a bittersweet note. As much of a pain in the ass some days were, I will remember every day I spent there. The days leading up to my last day, I think I found out more about my co-workers than I did my entire time there. They took me to a good but slow lunch at Applebee's, said our peace, talked about my adventure and said we would keep touch, and that was it. Minus them, I also have the Marines I worked with as a little fan base to help my morale for those bad days ahead.     I have spent the last two weeks basically doing nothing but mentally prepare. There is only so much research one can do before a trek. It does not matter until you actually hit the trail and learn from experience. As anxious as I am to start, I have had little sleep most of these nights about the unknown. That and having to comfort loved ones. I will also be leaving my dog for the first time for an extended period of time. She is my family and it will be hard on me. The cat can go to hell .     My girlfriend and I are spending a night at the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega GA tomorrow. Should have been two nights but some misunderstanding had taken place. Now we are trying to spend the last night at the lodge at Amicalola Falls. We are also thinking ahead more in the future. We found out there will be a tiny house festival a couple hours away all weekend and will be attending that along with the kickoff for the trail.    I dont really have else to say at this point other than LETS DO THIS!   ",,Amicalola Falls,"Mar 03, Fri",0
