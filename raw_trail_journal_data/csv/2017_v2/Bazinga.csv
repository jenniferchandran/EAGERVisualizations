Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/375509,"Well, here we go. I've been reading, planning, and dreaming about hiking the AT for about 20 years, and I'm less than a year away from finally having the opportunity. After 6 years in the army, 3 years working in power plants, a year in construction, 4 years of college, and 25 years as a teacher, I am retiring. I plan to begin on March 1, 2013. I have a tremendous amount of support from my friends and family. My wife will handle all the mailing. My dad will take care of our cattle farm, and other family members are available to help out with anything that might need done. That allows me to focus on putting one foot in front of the other without worrying about the farm. I will never take for granted how lucky I am to have this opportunity and the support to do it. I have done a lot of hiking and backpacking for the last 2.5 years and am in probably the best shape of my life. Now I need to maintain this for another year. In my next post I will discuss my gear. Thanks for reading my journal.",,View Entry,"Apr 26, Thu",0
Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/375517,"I would like to talk about the evolution of my gear in this entry. In order to do this, however, I need to back up about 20 years. My interest in hiking began innocently enough. My wife and I went for a walk one evening and I soon found myself wanting to walk every evening. I soon became bored with the area around our home and began looking around for trails. I soon knew every inch of all the trails in the state parks in our area. It was on one of these hikes in a local park, that I met some folks from the Buckeye Trail Association doing trail maintenance. During my conversation with them, I learned that the Buckeye Trail (and American Discovery Trail) go past my farm. I ended up maintaining the section of the Buckeye Trail that is in my area for a couple years until my schedule demanded that I give it up. During this time and to this day, I have volunteered my farm for hikers to camp. Most of the hikers have actually stayed in our house. Like most beginning hikers, I suspect, my first gear purchases were mostly WRONG! My first backpacking trip involved a 60 pound backpack (ouch). I did not enjoy that, and actually quit. Then something started happening that very few people are lucky enough to experience. I began having some very impressive hikers spend nights with us as they hiked past our farm. The list of visitors is a virtual Who's Who in the backpacking community. The list includes: Andy Skurka 04, Amy and Brent Anslinger 04, Ken and Marcia Powers 05, Robin and Patty (Milkshake and Gumdrop) 06, and just this spring, Barry and Julie (Boston and Cubby). Needless to say, I was able to learn a lot from these ""celebrities,"" and soon began replacing my pounds with ounces and having fun again. I am very lucky to have had the benefit of these experts. I plan to list the gear I am using on the gear list on this site.",,View Entry,"Apr 27, Fri",0
Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/375524,"This entry is for my friends and family that will be following my journal. These are the people that have had to put up with me talking about the Appalacian Trail (AT) for 20 years. With this entry I hope to educate you a bit about the AT and what I will be doing to try to hike it. I will just be listing details so this will not be a literary masterpiece. The AT is a marked (with 2""x8"" white blazes) trail that goes from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mt Katahdin in Maine. THis is in excess of 2100 miles. It takes, on average, 5-6 months to complete it. It has been said that only around 20 percent of those that start will finish. Most people hike it south to north (NOBOS) but some go north to south (SOBOS). There are shelters available throughout, but many spend nights in tents as well. There are also small towns along the way where hikers will occasionally stay in motels or hostels. Towns are also used to resupply or receive supplies through the mail. You will hear me refer to ""trail angels.""   These are people who, for various reasons, will set up along the trail and pass out food or drinks to the hikers. I will be hiking by myself, but on the AT you have no trouble finding friends to join up with. Most of the people on the AT tend to be college grads, but the ages range from the teens to the 80's. There are rattlesnakes and bears, but they are rarely a problem. I am well aware that there are many reasons why I could have trouble finishing this adventure. I could have an injury, an emergency at home, become homesick, or simply not enjoy it. Understanding this, I'm gonna give it a shot. I might make it, or I might be back in a week, we will see. If you are interested, I hope you follow my journey here. I will update as often as possible. There will not be many posts until March of 2013.",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Sat",0
Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/382619,"Thought I would check in since it has been a while since my last entry. Since my last entry, a couple things have happened. I have an official retirement date of November 1. Today I received my new tent and was able to become familiar with it very quickly with the instructions sent by the good folks at ZPacks. My equipment is pretty much ready to go, have been doing a lot of hiking and am anxious to get started.",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Fri",0
Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/384013,"The weatherman called for temps in the low 80's on Monday and Tuesday of this week, so I decided to take advantage of the break in the weather and do a two day hike to try out my new tent and other gear. Before I left I got a new weight on my loaded pack, and came in at 25.1 lbs with food and water. I did 27.5 miles (18 on Monday, and 9.5 coming in this morning) at Shawnee State Forest. Shawnee has a lot of serious ups and downs so it is great for training purposes. The tent performed well, and I held together pretty well also. I am enjoying reading the journals of my fellow 13ers.",,View Entry,"Jun 26, Tue",0
Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/393380,"Time is just creeping along. I was thinking today, while putting in a few miles hiking at East Fork State Park, that this wait for the start of my hike reminds me of when I was 10 yrs old, waiting on Christmas morning. Then I was thinking how ironic it is that I am a month away from my long-time dream of retiring, yet the March 1st beginning of my hike is the only one I think of. I hope I don't forget and show up for work on Nov 1st!As for preparation, I've been getting in 8-10 miles most weekends, and a couple miles on the treadmill every day. The cooler weather is certainly making things easier. With retirement looming, I have had a lot of people asking me about my future plans. This, of course, leads to a discussion about the AT. I truly enjoy these conversations. I have read many times that the first questions that people will ask is - ""Are you going alone?"" and ""Are you taking a gun?"". I assumed that the gun was for personal protection, but this week a friend suggested I'd need it to kill my food. After that, I decided I need to do a better job of explaining what the AT is all about. I am going to end this entry with a link to the Appalacian Trail Conservancy. Their site does a wonderful job of describing the trail, as well as what it takes to keep it maintained. I appreciate everyone that has decided to follow my journal.

I have been blessed with a great job and great people to work with, but now I can focus on getting everything ready for my AT adventure. I have done a lot of hiking since my last entry, and made changes to my equipment. I hope Sandy didn't do too much damage to the trail. I trust everyone is making progress with their preparations.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/395906,"Hello journal followers. Thought I'd give a couple of updates. I have been getting in a lot of miles of late and made a few changes after a recent overnite trip. I have decided to go with my Shangri la 1 tent when I begin, then probably change to the Heximid solo after the bugs come out. I decided to switch from the ""Packa"" (rain jacket/pack cover) to a golite jacket and sea to summit pack cover. We have had a very dry year which hasn't allowed for testing rain gear. Today we have some rain, so put on the new gear and went for a walk on the farm. I was happy with it, but found that I'll probably have to be in a short sleeve shirt under the jacket down to 30 degrees. I also tried out some NB trail runners. They were a no-go. I just cant find anything that beats the Merrill Moab Ventilators. I have been getting a lot of messages from fellow 13ers, and look forward to meeting all of you on the trail.

I have been on a couple overnight trips lately, and am happy with how my gear is performing. Had a healthy dose of rain on the last trip and fared pretty well.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398185,"One of the many reasons I look forward to starting my AT hike is to get a break from my treadmill. My son was deployed to Iraq nearly all of 2009. While he was gone I vowed to lose weight, and as part of that, I would do 2 miles on the treadmill every day he was gone. That ended up being 704 miles. After he returned, I began thinking about getting ready for my AT hike, so I pretty much have continued on the treadmill. My beloved Spauldings have been with me all the way but, as you can see, they are in pretty bad shape. Now I've learned that my son will be deploying to Afghanistan when I return from my hike. I'm not sure I can get another 700 miles out of them. Preparations are going well. I've made some minor changes, but am pretty well set to go. I have been spending most of my time getting things ready around the farm. I have a total of 12 pieces of equipment to service and preparations for the new calves that will start coming about the time I leave. If the weather cooperates, I have decided on a Feb 27 start date. The brave souls that are already out there have been blessed with some great weather. Oh yea, last weekend I visited my son and his family and helped welcome my second grandson (3rd grandchild) into the world. It looks like there will be plenty of fellow grandparents out there on the trail with me. I hope everyone is doing well in your preparations, and I look forward to meeting you all.",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Mon",0
Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398514,"I've officially decided on Feb 27 as my start date. That means the count down stands at 36 days! Was able to get in 25 miles of day hiking last weekend, but am really getting tired of the same trails. Those of you following my journal and others may become confused when we mention that we are hiking alone, yet there is a picture of ourselves posted that looks like it was taken by someone else. This is usually done with the help of a product called the Stixpic. It enables you to attach a camera to the end of your trekking pole so you can extend it away from you while taking the picture. Since I'm using my iPhone 5 for pictures, I searched for an adapter for using this with the Stixpic. Long story short, there are none. Not to be deterred, dad and I made one, which, hopefully, is showing up (right-side-up) with this post. In other news, after mentioning the many miles I've logged on my treadmill in my last post, it quit working! So, no more treadmill before the hike. I am humbled by the number of people that are viewing my journal. I hope my entries will be worthy of your time, and possibly educational. Until next time ...",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Tue",0

I will have more control over my circumstances than back then however. My family had a great send off for me. It's great to know that there are so many friends and family almost as excited as I am.

The lodge sits up the hill from the visitor's center where the Approach Trail begins. When I say hill, I mean a serious hill. We did not go back down to the visitor's center because we didn't want to drive the car back up. Yes, its that steep. It was so foggy I couldn't have gotten any decent pictures anyway. We will head back down in the morning, they will drop me off, and we will part ways. I will sign the official register at the visitor's center then weigh my pack on their scales. After that I will head up the Approach Trail. This trail is 8.8 miles, and is not actually a part of the Appalachian Trail. Because of this, the daily mileage which you will start seeing on my journal will not be very much. If you add 8.8 to it, you will know how far I actually walked. I would like to thank Kelli and my wife for helping to get me here. I have heard some whispering around the room about a layover in Gatlinburg on their trip back. Its hard telling what kind of trouble they might find. Until next time.","Amacalola Falls

I signed in as thru-hiker # 85. I then weighed my backpack on their scales. It came in right at 30 pounds. It was then time to pass through the rock archway and get started. We took several pictures, I thanked Kelli and my wife, and off I went. Within 5 minutes I was greeted with 425 steps to the top of Amacalola Falls. The Falls were beautiful, but boy, did those steps kick my butt! The rest of the hike was great. Good trail, good weather, but no company. I passed several day hikers and talked to them, but was alone all day. After taking pictures atop Springer, I headed to Stover Shelter. I am alone here as well, but it is a wonderful two level shelter. I decided to go ahead and stay inside the shelter, so I'm currently in my sleeping bag in the upper level typing this. I'm glad I did because it just started raining! I don't have reception here, so I will send this when I get on top of one of the mountains tomorrow. I will be headed to the Gooch Mountain Shelter.

First, always check the previous journal in case there were two posted on the same day like this time. Secondly, I'd like to congratulate my son Adam for completing his Masters Degree today.   Now, back to the hike. I got up at 7:00 and was on the trail by 8:00. I hiked through some beautiful trail in the beginning, then it changed to trail similar to what we have at home. Throughout the day I caught up with and passed the hikers that stayed in the shelter ahead of me. We all eventually arrived at Gooch Shelter around 2:00. Three of us decided to move ahead 1.4 miles and tent camp. This will give us a head start tomorrow, which is important because we have to get through the next 15 miles without staying in a shelter. You must have a hard-shell bear canister in that area. I am here tonight with a guy from England, two young men from New Hampshire, and another man(with a dog) and woman from this area. All of us are attempting a thru hike. We had a nice Bon fire, but everyone is in their sleeping bags now. No sun today, and quite cold. It's in the 20s right now.

I was the first one up and on the trail (7:30). Most of the day wasn't anything special, except for hiking through frosty trees when I reached the higher elevations. The day ended with a climb up and down Blood Mountain. It was the highlight of my hike so far. It was the tallest mountain I've climbed. It was above cloud level, the trees had frost on them, and the ground was covered with snow. It was really a special experience. I hiked by myself again, and ended my day at the Mountain Crossings Hostel. The AT actually goes right through it. It is also an outfitter, so business is good. I was able to get a shower, wash clothes, get a real meal, and have a warm bunk for the night. Three of the hikers I was with last night made it here and we are all headed for Low Gap Shelter tomorrow. I am certainly tired, but am doing great physically so far.

I hiked out with the group today and hung with them for about an hour and dropped back. I prefer hiking alone (not that I had a choice) because I'm more likely to take breaks, which is very important. I met the gang at Unicoi Gap, where they decided to call a shuttle and spend the night in Hiawassee. I am staying in a hostel near Dicks Creek Gap tomorrow night so I hiked on to Tray Mountain Shelter. It's built near the top of the mountain so the wind is brutal as I lay in my tent typing this. There are a man and wife with two dogs (they were with us last night too) along with another man in the shelter and another couple tenting.

I went up and down a couple of pretty good size mountains on my way to Dicks Creek Gap, where I planned to stay at the Blueberry Patch Hostel. I made it there fairly early, but with no phone service, the next problem was how to get the three plus miles to the hostel. The only person there was a man in a van waiting for hikers that he would offer free shuttles to a motel in town. He told another hiker and me that he couldn't make a special trip to drop us somewhere else. We then told him that there wasn't anyone else coming, so he said jump in. This hostel came highly recommended and now I know why. It is a man and wife that do a Christian ministry through taking care of hikers.

I started in rain gear because it rained last night and was supposed to today. I made it to the North Carolina border by 1:45. One state down! As soon as I took a picture of the border sign and stepped into NC, it started raining. Now, what are the odds that after a week with no rain, it would start then? For those that don't know, I lived in NC for 6 yrs while in the Army. I thought back to the day I was discharged and was driving home. Could it be that, being the young, rebellious lad I was, that I may have uttered a few inappropriate words as I drove across the state line? If so, she is exacting her revenge on me right now. When I got to the shelter it was full and that meant setting up the tent in the rain. Now all that effort that went into getting cleaned up yesterday was for naught. What a mess.

We ended up leap frogging each other all day. We have a very similar pace. Once we finished the climb, the trail was basically rolling. The trail was built well, which makes for better hiking. Until around 2:00 we were hiking in a cloud, so we really had no clue what was around us. There are four other people at the shelter tonight that have a journal - Caribou and Dovetail as well as the Ogden twins. It's going to be another cold one tonight so I'm in my tent.

In yesterday's journal entry, I broke one of my personal rules by criticizing the condition of the trail. Had I waited until today, I would have understood more about the situation. They (trail maintainers) have been doing some amazing work on the trail north of Erwin. The trail and the scenery was beautiful.

It had snowed all night, so we didn't have to get to the top of Roan Mountain to find 12 inches of snow. We rotated leaders to break trail so we didn't wear anyone out. After 5 miles we came to a road and after calculating our speed and distance to go, realized we weren't going to make it and needed to get off trail ASAP. We started walking toward town and making phone calls. Finally we got a ride to a hostel in Roan, TN. As I type this at 7:00 pm it is still snowing and is predicted to continue into the night. Now for the journal entry I hoped I'd never have to make. When planning this trip (over many years), I kept reading over and over that completing the AT is a mental thing, not a physical one. I focused my preparation on preparing myself physically because I knew I could handle the mental part. Well .... I was very happy from the start that physically, I was doing very well. It was also apparent to me from the start that the mental part may be a problem. Walking the AT is very simple; you spend 8-9 hours a day walking and thinking, then find a place to sleep and eat. I found myself thinking more and more about how nice it would be to be home. Every evening I would read messages from my journal offering encouragement and would be inspired to continue. Today, while walking up mountains in snow up to my thigh, I finally decided I would be happier at home. The thought of walking up mountains everyday for 4-5 more months was simply too much. Ironically, after I made up my mind to do this, I realized that for the first time since the beginning of my hike, nothing hurt. I am probably in the best shape of my life. I remember reading a journal last year in which a man had decided to go home. His explanation was very simple - he said that he simply would rather be at home. When I announced this decision to my hiking friends, we decided it would sound better if I changed my original goal to hiking the Smokies. Then I could say that I over-achieved. But that isn't the way it happened.The thing I regret the most is the same thing that actually kept me out here this long. The people that have followed my journal and offered amazing support have been very important to me. I can't help but feel I'm letting them down. Especially my family and the students and teachers at MOMS and other schools. I have enjoyed keeping the journal as much as I've enjoyed the wonderful views of GA, NC, and TN. Finally, my journey lasted exactly a month and covered 371.3 miles. I have made lifelong friends and enough memories to last forever. There is nothing like the AT. It is incredibly difficult, but equally rewarding. I would encourage anyone with the dream of hiking the AT, to prepare, then go for it. Again, thank you so much for following my journal.

There were a couple big climbs and 17.3 miles to go. But there would be wild ponies at the end! After you settle into a rhythm, you usually go for hours without anything big happening. Such would not be the case today. About two miles into the hike I was daydreaming when I noticed movement to my right. I turned to see that it was big, it was black, and it was running toward me! I started trying to turn on my phone to get a picture (I know, probably not the proper first reaction). When it got close enough, I could see that was a beautiful ...Angus heifer. After my pulse rate was under control, I walked on up the trail which led to a fence. I realized then that the heifer was on the wrong side of the pasture fence. I went through the gate into the field with the herd. I then did what anyone would do - I started looking for the bull. Just then I heard a commotion behind me and turned around. The heifer had jumped a little fawn and it ran right past me. I then turned back around and noticed the bull, standing right on the trail - of course. I decided to make a wide detour around him, but he didn't seem to care at all. The rest of the hike was uneventful until I got to Mt Rogers and Grayson Highlands State Park.

It was early and they really took off when I surprised them. A little while later I rounded a corner and was almost in the middle of a herd of Long Horn Cattle. Some were laying and some up eating. I sure didn't scare them, they hardly noticed I was there. As the trail led to the base of the mountain, I came upon a campground, also known as The Scales Livestock Corral. Years ago, when a lot of cattle were raised in the mountains, the cowboys had to drive them to market. When they realized how much weight they were losing on this trip (They are sold by the pound), they decided to sell them up on the mountain before they were moved.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/421034,"I decided that it was time for my 2013 AT adventures to come to an end. I must say that it was an amazing experience. The scenery and the people are amazing. I really enjoyed writing about the adventure on here and the amazing support from friends, family, and people I will never meet. I highly recommend a later start for prospective hikers. The views, smells, sounds, and number of people to hike with are so much better. This has definitely been the hardest as well as one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had. Thanks to my family for all your help and support. My wife and Kelly took care of shuttling me all over the place, my dad took care of the farm, my sister Sheri took care of posting pictures and my Aunt Linda was ready to take care of me in the Waynesboro, Va area, but I just couldn't quite get there. Thru hiking the AT is an amazing accomplishment. I will forever be impressed by people that are able to accomplish it. Since my thru hike has evolved into a section hike, I'm pretty sure Bazinga might be back in the years to come. The last cattle herd is mine here on the farm.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423693,"Well, I'm back for a third time! Some family members decided to visit my aunt in central Virginia later this month, so I couldn't pass up a chance to hike for a couple weeks and get an easy ride home. So this morning at 1am I jumped on a Greyhound and headed back to Marion, Va to continue my hike.   Boy, has it been an interesting and long day. I had 4 interesting things happen. First, if you've ever spent time at a Greyhound bus terminal, you know how interesting that can be. I spent several hours at two different ones. Next, after arriving in Marion at about 11:30 I went to Wendys to kill 3 hours waiting for the 2:30 shuttle the city of Marion provides for 50 cents (very nice of them). After eating and drinking all I could, I was standing by the door watching for the bus (it was raining). I noticed a woman staring at me several times. After a while the man with her walked over to me and asked very nicely if I needed some money to get something to eat! I must admit that one shocked me. After talking with the man and explaining what I was doing, I found out that he had gone to school in Seaman, Ohio, which is about 20 minutes from my house. Thirdly, after hiking for 530 miles, amazingly, today was the first day I hiked in hard rain. I got started at about 3:30 and was able to get to the next shelter (7.7 miles). I was so glad to see the shelter empty so I could spread my stuff out to dry. It is still raining. And finally, my favorite. About 3 miles north of Partnership Shelter, I saw my first bear. Actually it was 4 bears, a mother and 3 cubs. They were running from my right to my left across the trail about 50 yards out. I was amazed at how the cubs were keeping up with the mother. They didn't look any bigger than a cat. Naturally, since it was raining my phone/camera was buried in my backpack, so no pictures. Hopefully this rain will stop by morning and the sun will be shining! Until next time. Sent from my iPhone","Home

I was alone at the shelter last night and its looking like I will be again tonight. According to the shelter journals there is a group a few hours ahead of me. I had the best nights sleep last night that I've had in a long time. I guess I just need to sleep every two days in the wonderful Virginia air. I can now say that I have seen a shelter mouse. There was a nest on the top plate of the wall. When I shined my light on the nest he would stick his head up. According to the journal this was a new nest because the old one was recently torn out and it's occupant was, shall we say, dispatched. I made a deal with the mouse that we would leave each other alone. When I got up this morning the rain had stopped. When I began hiking, at 7:00, it started again. It continued for about an hour and a half and then quit for the rest of the day. As I'm typing this, it is starting to thunder, and now rain. Glad I'm in a shelter again! I saw a lot of wildlife today. I even had a Mink come hopping down the trail toward me. He clearly didn't see me, so when he was about 10 feet out, I shook my trekking pole and he took a sharp left. I went under Interstate 81 today. If any of you are familiar with this area, that should give you an idea where I am. I have quite a challenge tomorrow. It's a long day, with a 2000 foot climb.

Oh boy, I just heard a Whip r Will, this could be a long night. I had a big climb this morning and by noon I had reached Chestnut Knob Shelter. It is unique in several ways. It's made of stone, sits on top of a mountain, and is totally enclosed with a door. Oh, and a million dollar view of the valley below. I wish I was there now to see what it looks like with all the lights on. I made a big mistake on the second part of my hike today. My feet were hurting after doing big miles in wet shoes yesterday. I really wanted to stay at Chestnut knob when I got there. The problem was that there is no water there (top of a mountain). It was a big hike either way to get water, so I opted for plan A, which was another 10 miles to the next shelter. Then I compounded my problems by passing up the first water source (I had a bottle and a half). Long story short, there was no more water until the next shelter. Were it not for another hiker I met along the way, who gave me half a bottle (putting himself at risk) I'm not sure what might have happened. I'm now maxed out on water, but can hardly put weight on my feet. I will reevaluate in the morning and decide what to do. I may just hang around the shelter and finish my book! Despite my stupidity, Virginia was still beautiful today. I will say though, we've grown to love her rolling hills and cow pastures, but today she was acting like Ga, Tenn, and NC with that big mountain. That will be enough of that!

I was able to top off my water and drink a grape soda. I crossed Rt 77 toward the end of the day. I drove that highway for 6 yrs while I was in the Army. The trail today was great. I was on big mountains all day, but the trail was relatively straight along the side near the top. That makes for some great hiking and views.

I decided to call it a day early and do 6 miles in the morning to resupply. While it was raining, an interesting fella stopped in for a break and I finally had someone to talk to (poor guy). The first thing you notice about him is his umbrella. They are becoming very popular with hikers. He has a very small backpack and a base weight (without food and water) of 6 pounds. Because of this he does 30 mile days. He is also working full time while on the trail. He does computer work from home so he goes off trail to a hotel once a week and works. He then mails the computer to another town and hikes to it. He said that he goes on vacation and when he gets back he has more vacation time then when he left.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/424619,"Ok, get comfortable, I have a lot to talk about. Last night, after I sent the journal, I had another hiker come in, so finally someone to talk to! He just graduated from the University of Virginia and already has a job working for a company in Boston. I enjoyed our rather lengthy conversation. I did find that he isn't an early riser though, because I packed up and left without him even noticing. My first objective was Trent's Grocery for resupply, shower, laundry, and real FOOD! I never have understood why hikers seem to be obsessed with taking pictures of their food (you can see the lovely photograph I took of my cheeseburger, potato wedges, and soft drink in the photo section). The store had a little campground with one older gentleman camping there. He has been there for a month, but will be leaving tomorrow. We talked while I was waiting for my phone to charge. As he worked through his 12 pack, I gradually did more listening than talking. He was a good-hearted guy though. On the way back to the trail I grabbed another sandwich from the store to eat here at the shelter tonight. Now the hiking part. I forgot to mention that before coming to the road that lead to Trent's, there was a very impressive suspension bridge across Kimberling Creek. I took several pictures of it. After leaving the store I had 8 miles to go to the next shelter. The map showed it as being very flat so I knew it wouldn't be a problem. This trail, as opposed to those of the last couple days was at the bottom of the mountain following Dismal Creek. I may have to move this trail to the top of my favorites list. Dismal Creek is big and fast moving. There were Rhododendron and Mountain Laurel in bloom and small creeks everywhere. I lost track of how many bridges I crossed. I also came upon a large pond that had been built in the middle of the forest. It was being fed by a 10 inch pipe taking the crystal clear water from one of the creeks. The pipe was running full. What I wouldn't give to have a pond like that. Tonight I'm alone (so far) at Wapiti Shelter. It may have the nicest setting of any shelter I've seen. Sadly, despite its appeal, it was the setting for what many would consider the most tragic event in the history of the AT. While I haven't read all the details, a man (Robert) and a woman (Susan) were murdered in the shelter by a deranged man one night in 1981. I was anxious to read the shelter journal to see what people were saying and if the shelter is being used. I'm happy to report that it is well used. I can't decide where to go tomorrow. It's a short 7 miles to Woods Hole Hostel, which is said to be ""a slice of heaven not to be missed.""

I am now actually in another hostel run by a Catholic Church in Pearisburg. Today's hike took me back up the mountains where the streams disappear, but the advantage is the views. There were some outstanding ones today. I quit taking pictures of them because they just can't capture how they really look. I was able to accomplish another goal today. A few days ago I started noticing comments by Warren Doyle in the shelter journals. Warren is an AT icon. He has hiked the entire trail 16 times and is currently working on his 17th. He has over 35,000 trail miles. He has accomplished this with thru hikes and section hikes. He also takes entire groups on thru hikes. I knew that Warren was right ahead of me so I was hoping to meet him. We both ended up at the same shelter for a break today and spent quite a while talking. Rather than me trying to list all of his accomplishments, Google his name if you are interested. You will find that he's quite interesting. Warren was also able to elaborate on the murders that occurred at the shelter I stayed in last night. He lives in this area and was very interested in the case when it occurred. He recommended a book that was written about it. The man that Warren is currently hiking with, as well as the boy that stayed with me in the shelter a couple nights ago are here with me tonight.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/425476,"An early start this morning. The young man from Virginia, whose trail name is Snake Bait, and I had a ride to the trail set up with the man section hiking with Warren. They were meeting at McDonalds and we were going with him. I asked him if we were going to eat breakfast or they were just meeting in the parking lot. He said they might be eating, but that he would have to drop Snake Bait and me off before he went because they were switching cars and there wouldn't be room in Warren's car. Well. He must have noticed that ""I'M NOT GETTING MY McD COFFEE?!?!"" look in my eye, because he immediately suggested we could leave early and run by McD's first. So my hike started off at 6:00 with 2 bagel sandwiches and a large coffee on board. One thing you learn quick out here, is that when you come into town, you climb down and when you leave, you climb up. And boy, did we climb! Again there was great scenery and views. Then the thunder started. Before the day was over I got soaked twice. My feet are now hurting again. The highlight of the day though, has been two bear encounters. The first occurred while I was hiking, before the rain started. Unlike the encounter a week ago, where the bear saw me first, this time I saw him first. He was about 75 yards ahead and right on the trail. I decided to take a picture before doing anything. After that, I did what all the experts suggest down here. I backed away a little more, then let him know I was there by banging my trekking poles together. He looked up and saw me then started running away. Then he stopped. I banged the poles again. He ran again, then stopped. I banged them a third time. This time he ran over the ridge. I quickly scooted down the trail with a few backward glances and then took a restroom break. The second encounter was here at the shelter when I started cooking. I saw movement about 40 ft away and noticed it was a bear. He didn't see me as he began walking down the trail toward the shelter. I stood up and said in a normal voice ""go away bear."" He looked startled, then turned around and went away. I guess the experts know what they are talking about since both situations ended as they said they would. Both of the bears were very big and healthy looking.

Getting caught out in the rain again yesterday has dealt my feet another setback. This is an issue I will need to address for future trips. It will start with better shoes. The trail today was very rocky. Rocks are rough on your feet as well. I don't think I've ever heard of a hiker that likes rocks. There were some more great views today, and when the trail returns to the lower elevations its jungle-like. I passed another of the popular places on the trail. A man, known as The Captain, has a house across a large creek from the trail. He welcomes hikers to camp in his yard or on his porch and has installed a zipline to allow them to cross the river. I have a couple of pictures in the photo section. I hiked through and am sleeping in a section called Mountain Pond. I am told that this is the area where Dirty Dancing was filmed. I know my wife will appreciate that. I think this is the first time on the hike that I have not had cellphone reception all day. Hopefully I can get caught up sending journals out tomorrow. Snake Bait caught me on the trail today. His mother and younger brother are here for a visit so they were at a hotel last night. We sat and talked for awhile since today is probably the last time I will see him. He also shared a piece of his mom's banana nut bread! The young Japanese couple (Chop Chop and Double Chop) are here again tonight, but tenting. I think my snoring ran them off. We did sit and talk for quite a while this evening. It does take patience, but we eventually learned a lot about each other. They are from Kyoto (sp). They are on their honeymoon and are attempting a thru hike. He is a Jr High social studies teacher.

I doubt that Chop Chop and Double Chop will come this far, but I do enjoy their company. I didn't intend to go as far as I did today, but around noon it started to thunder. I became obsessed with getting to the next shelter which was 12 miles, to avoid getting wet again. I eventually realized that I should have already been there. Sure enough, after consulting my trail book, I was 2 miles past it. Since a hiker never goes back, it was now 4 miles to the next shelter, so I was really moving down the trail. I got here at about 5:00. It never did rain.    Last night I fell asleep after reading in the shelter journal that a bear had come up to the shelter about a week ago. Suddenly something banged against the shelter floor. I jumped out of my sleeping bag to find that it was a young boy that had slammed his backpack down after arriving late to the shelter. Today's hike had a lot of variety. I started in the ""jungle,"" walked across about a mile of pasture, climbed a mountain, walked 5 miles of ridge line, then descended to this shelter. I got to see the famous Keiffer Oak today. It is the largest oak tree on the southern AT, measuring over 18 feet around the trunk. It is over 300 yrs old. The Dover Oak in NY is slightly larger. I crossed the Eastern Continental Divide today as well. There is a sign nailed to a tree marking its location. I found about 10 ticks on me while walking across the pasture. These are the first ticks I've seen out here. I got an email today from Shake N Bake, who I hiked with in the beginning of my hike. He summited Mt Katahdan last Sunday. Incredibly, he summited with 7 people that were at Greasy Creek Hostel the night before I left the trail. That is an incredible accomplishment.

I had a short 10 mile day planned so the pace was much slower than yesterday. Very soon I started up the mountain that has the monument to Audie Murphy on its top. It was a really long climb. It seemed longer than my book says it is. The trail was well built and maintained and the scenery was great. At least the scenery on the mountain, because shortly after starting up, I was in the clouds and could see nothing else. The monument was really nice. It was built near the site where Audie died in a plane crash in 1971. It has become customary to place a small stone around the monument. There are literally thousands of stones and other items around it. The trip down the mountain was uneventful. I was setting up in the shelter by 12:30.

One is attempting a flip thru hike, and the other is an instrumental music teacher out for his yearly section hike. It began to rain about dark and continued through the night. I was up and on the trail at 7:00 this morning. The first objective was Dragon's Tooth. It is a huge rock protrusion that looks like, well, a dragon's tooth. It began, as always, with a climb up a mountain. It rained most of the morning. When I arrived at dragon's tooth, after about 5 miles, I was, of course the only one there. My pictures weren't very good because it was still raining. When I started down the mountain I was genuinely surprised. Of all the talk that goes on out on the trail, nobody had ever mentioned the climb down. It ended up being a mile of rock climbing, in the rain. At times I had to throw my trekking poles down the hill so I could use my hands. In places they had placed hand holds (bars) to help with the climb. It was a bit nerve wracking in places, but it was a lot of fun. I would rather have tried it without the rain though. The rest of my hike out to VA 311 was mostly a ridge walk, with plenty of rocks of course. I read an entry in one of the shelter journals that said Virginia sure is proud of their rocks because they built the trail over every one of them.

Our hike began by going around Kent Pond (would be a lake back home). We then came to a water falls (Thundering Falls) and a boardwalk across a swampy area. I was able to get some pretty good pictures of these things. The rest of the day was just climbing one mountain after another. It was a rough day and will only be getting worse. Toward the end of the hike we took a side trail to see a cabin with a lookout tower on top. The private owners allow hikers to stay in it, but the two main requirements (water and privy) were not there, so we moved on. We are at Winturri Shelter in our tents. There are several hikers here, and one dog. I talked to a man from North Carolina who is doing an annual section hike with a group of friends. They started in 2000, and are hiking south to north, but doing the sections north to south so they are closer to home when they finish.

We had pretty well built trail today and, of course, several mountains to conquer. Some of today's highlights included: hearing a turkey (didn't know they had them up here), found a blackberry patch which resulted in a considerable delay. As we were climbing down to the road where we were going to head west .2 miles so Papaw could resupply, we came upon some trail magic. This was a good one! They must have just left it, because there was frozen water and Gatorade, along with bananas, PBJ sandwiches, cakes, cheese, and chips. Needless to say, we pigged out before heading to the store. Good thing, because all the ""market"" had was some drink in brown bottles (not beer) and small containers of ice cream. Not exactly what we expected from a market. We did each get an ice cream and ate it on their porch while we charged our phones. On the way back to the trail we revisited the trail magic and got enough food for breakfast. There is another store 7 miles into our hike tomorrow. They also serve breakfast, so you can count on an early start tomorrow. Soon after starting back up the trail, I realized that eating all the sweets had messed up my restroom routine. Realizing that we had another 2.5 miles to the next shelter, I was considering my options. Just then, sitting off the trail about 30 yds, in the middle of nowhere, was a privy! And it had its own TP! Now folks, it don't get no better than that! It really seems out here that when you are really in need, something happens to help you out. Tomorrow we will get real close to New Hampshire and the dreaded Whites. We did cut the miles a little short today because we were tired (and stuffed with trail magic).

Just outside Norwich, Vt, we came upon the first of three trail magic(s). A former thru hiker was providing ""refreshments,"" and had a nice group of hikers taking advantage. There was some great conversation and I even learned how to identify a White vs Red Pine tree. When we set out again, we had a 2.5 mile road walk through the cities of Norwich, Vt and Hanover, NH. The Connecticut River runs between the two cities, and the middle of the river marks the boundary between the two states. Hanover is the home to Dartmouth College. It is very much a college town, and freshman orientation week had closed down one building that is normally available for hikers to store their gear. We jumped on a bus and got a motel room outside of town. Tomorrow we will resupply and be back on the trail headed toward the Whites. This will be the most difficult climbing on the trail.

It also worked out great because last night is the only time it has rained since we started. We were up early, ready to resupply and get back on the trail. We caught the bus, but had to ride it through two other towns before it got us back to Hanover. Once there, we went to the food co-op and loaded back up on food. There were a lot of hikers around the store. Since there is no hostel in Hanover, a lot of hikers camp off the trail where it leaves town, which is actually just past the Dartmouth College baseball diamond outfield. I met the first hiker today that I have hiked with before. It was Tangy. The last time I saw him was in Damascus. He had to leave the trail for awhile. He came off at Waynesboro, Va, moved up to Massachusetts and is hiking to Maine. He will then go back and finish the section he skipped. It was nice to see him again. We had great weather and trail today, so despite the late start, we decided to pass up our planned stop at 10 miles and hiked on. We ended up doing 16.6 miles to the Trapper John Shelter. The last two miles were a pretty tough climb. When I walked up to the shelter I could see and hear a large group of what I assumed were young teenagers camped behind the shelter. I later learned that they are a group of students from Harvard. Not much difference I suppose. There are a new group of thru hikers here as well. I enjoyed talking with them earlier.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/431727,"Oh my, where do I start? This was quite a day. We experienced highs and lows today. Lets start with last night. As you know, we were at the hostel. There were two very young girls that came in with a dog. They were full of life and looking for adventure. They found out that a local pizza joint has the Moosilauke Monster Challenge. Two people are served 8 lbs of pizza. If they eat it all, it's free. If not, $30. They made it to 4.5 lbs before they couldn't keep it down anymore. They looked pretty miserable. This morning Papaw and I had our own Moosilauke Challenge. We had a 4000ft climb in 5 miles. The climb went real well. We made it in 3 hrs, 15 min. It was the first time I had been above tree line except for Alaska. Since it rained last night, things were wet and we were in clouds for most of the climb. When we got to the top, the wind was blowing the clouds by at 40-50 mph. It was a bit of a challenge to stand up. Now the bad part of the day. As we headed down the mountain, I began to feel like we were on the wrong trail. Papaw was feeling it to. I told papaw I would head back up until I met the other two hikers that were up top with us, or until I was back up at the sign. A short while later, I ran into the hikers. I asked if they were sure about the trail. The girl told me she understood the sign the same as me. Since they rarely paint blazes up here, we couldn't count on them. So we all headed down the trail. Toward the end we noticed a very old blue blaze (wrong color). We decided to go on down and try to figure out what to do. We came to an info board that had an old note from a group that had had the same problem. Long story short, Papaw and I climbed back up the mountain until we found the problem, then went down the correct trail about 2 miles to a shelter. It would be real nice if the maintainers would fix this problem. We ended up hiking about 16 miles and only 7.8 counted. Not good. On the way down the trail to the shelter, we came across a bird. I think it might have been a partridge. I'll post a picture so someone can tell me. Anyway, it stood right in the trail like it was wanting something. I'm guessing hikers have been feeding it. After I got a picture, I started walking away and it flew around and landed in front of me again. Very interesting. I told Papaw that it was trying to tell us we were on the wrong trail again.

We had to hike the rest of the way down Mt Moosilauke, which proved quite a challenge. While it was only about 1.5 miles, it was very steep and over large rocks. Most of the trail up here is extremely rocky. What we are doing now is more rock climbing than hiking. The problem with that is that it goes very slow. You have to focus on where every step will go and what route you need to take. One mistake could be very bad. I find that I'm getting mentally tired from focusing on these things for so long. One neat thing about our trip down the mountain, was that there was a waterfall right beside us almost the whole way. The rest of the day was more rock scrambling. We did run into Tangy, Whirled Peas, and Hobo (he has a journal) on the trail today. We decided to stop early again this afternoon, hoping the extra rest will get us back on track.

After that, the sun came out and started drying things out. A few minutes after we got our tents set up this evening it started raining lightly and continues as I type this. Now, today's happenings. We were up and leaving camp at 6:30. There was an older crowd there last night and all of them were up and ready to go, although we never saw them again. Our first 2+ hrs were serious rock climbing up South Kinsman Mountain. It was so bad we finally put our trekking poles away and used our hands. The view from the top was great. We then went down and up North Kinsman Mountain. On the way down from there, we ran into a man and his son who are flying ""Save Olympic Wrestling"" flags from the highest peaks on the AT. It is hard to believe they would eliminate Olympic wrestling. He has a website, but I forgot what it is. I'm sure a Google search would find it. About the time we were ready to break for dinner, we came upon our first Hut (Lonesome Lake Hut). The huts are run by the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC). They have rooms you can rent and they serve meals. They are pricy, but they allow thru hikers to do ""work for stay."" After the meal for the guests is over, the hikers get the leftovers, then can sleep on the dining room floor. It was way too early for us to do that, but they offer soup and coffee for a couple bucks, and we definitely took advantage of that. After leaving the hut, we had the best trail of this trip, so we really made good time. We are now headed up Little Haystack Mountain. We passed a tenting area, which is also run by the AMC, and costs $8 pp to pitch a tent. We opted to passed it up and found a place off trail that is free! Tomorrow we will also go over Mt Lincoln and Mt Lafayette. At one point we will be above tree line for 2 miles. Might have to get the coat out.

When we got there, we took pictures then hung out in the snack bar for awhile. Mt Washington recorded the highest land wind speed in world history at 231 mph. It was a wicked 5 mph during our stay.

We had breakfast at the Visitors Center and talked about the remainder of the trip. I told Papaw that I was ready to end my hike and was concerned about his worsening foot condition.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/433058,"While I will never be a thru hiker, and may never complete the trail as a section hiker, I have learned a great deal about long distance hiking from experience as well as other hikers. Knowing how much I learned from this site during my preparations, I would like to just write down some thoughts while this train rambles on toward Ohio. Obviously everyone is different and my ideas won't work for everyone, so take what you need and leave the rest.1. The AT will probably be the toughest thing you ever do. For me the mental aspect was the toughest. I was actually pleased with how I handled it physically.2. Being in shape before you start will help, but you can hike yourself into shape. Just take it slow.3. Don't worry about going alone, you will find a group of friends very quickly. I think it's better going alone, because you have no obligations that way. 4. Quit worrying about bears, moose, and mice. They are scared of you and will run away. The only thing that changes this is leaving food around campsites. They come looking for this food after you leave, and if rewarded often enough, will get more bold.5. Remember, when hanging a bear bag, it needs to be out of bear reach from the ground AND the tree trunk.6. If your shoes are wet from the day before, put the wet socks back on. If you use dry ones, they will be wet again anyway. I carried 2 pair of socks. 7. Use trekking poles. I suggest carbon fiber. Papaw had aluminum and bent both of them. My poles may be my favorite piece of equipment. They are Black Diamonds. I take the wrist straps off so I can let them go if they get hung up and I fall. 8. I like trail runner type shoes. They are light weight which is easier on the legs. I had trouble with room for my toes and Solomans ended up being my favorite. 9. I did not do mail drops. I was always able to resupply along the way. 10. I liked my Pepsi can alcohol stove, but would seriously consider going without a stove. You can eat hot food in town. Papaw quit carrying his stove and did fine.11. I used Aqua Mira drops for water treatment and had no trouble (I did run out once). I didn't use a filter and occasionally had ""floaties"" in the water, but got used to drinking them. The little packets of flavoring are great too. It adds a little variety and is lightweight. My favorite is lemonade. 12. I used my 20 degree down mummy sleeping bag all summer. Other than In March, it was way too hot. I never even zipped it up. 13. Vitamin I (ibuprofen) is very effective.14. Take the time to rinse off every evening. Go well downstream from where hikers get their water. If you have a dog, keep it away from the water. 15. Use the same clothes to hike in daily, but change into another set for sleeping. 16. Carry a backup light. I use clip on type on my visor.17. Carry a guidebook. I like the AWOL version.18. Carry some cash, credit card, medical cards, cellphone (if desired). I carried a cellphone with a battery charger and was able to maintain my journal daily without the phone ever going dead.19. I carried rain gear, but rarely used it. It is handy to wear when you are doing laundry. Thank you all for following my journal this summer. I really enjoyed writing it.

Next, we came to VA 810, USFS 36 (gravel), according to my guide book. This is important because it is the exact spot where I surpassed 1000 miles on the AT (including the miles in Vermont and New Hampshire). We then had a decision to make. Do we stop after 9 miles at Johns Hollow Shelter, or do 18 miles to Punchbowl Shelter? As you can see, we opted for Punchbowl. This added 2200 ft of elevation, which was a butt kicker.

I must say, they were very interesting. I had to look long and hard to find one acceptable for the photo section. There were two men, a woman, and a dog at the shelter preparing to leave. They left Springer in March, so they aren't in a hurry. The dog, a Blue Heeler, was laying in the back of the shelter and looked very tired. I also ran into Boogie Pilgrim again. He is such and interesting guy to talk to. I asked him if I could take his picture, since I imagined my readers were curious what a Boogie Pilgrim looked like. He agreed, and asked for one of us too. I decided to feature his picture in today's journal. Coming off Priest Mountain we had a 3000 ft steep decent. That will do a number on your knees. We all survived with some minor scrapes.

I came upon a note on the trail saying there was an angry Yellow Jackets nest 30 yards ahead on the left, 1 foot off the trail. Just then, another hiker came along I hadn't met before.

This time I arrived in Virginia via Amtrak, and was picked up and accompanied by my hiking buddy, Papaw. When I began my hike in 2013, I wanted to carry something with me that I could pass along to my grandchildren. I chose to paint up hickory nuts from our woods, and write their names on them. The picture I took on top of Springer shows these momentos, but you'll notice there is one without a name. I called that one my grandchild to be named later. I suspected in 2013 that there may be another grandchild in the future, and I didn't want to have to hike it again, so I took a spare. As you can see in the second picture, I was right! Our new granddaughter is Katie, and she has taken her rightful place in my hickory nut container. After a 9 1/2 hour train ride, Papaw and his wife picked me up and we hit the trail at about 5:00. We hiked 5 miles to a campground. Great trail and great weather. It's 5 am now, and a thunderstorm just rolled through. Until next time. Sent from my iPhone","Blackrock Parking Area

It let up long enough for us to pack up and get started. Then it started raining again. That lasted for an hour, then the rest of the day it has acted like it will storm again, but hasn't yet. This resulted in cool temps, with wind, which = no bugs! The trail and scenery today was excellent. We also walked through around 3 miles where they had a fire this spring. We could still smell the smoke. From the looks of the branches and logs, it was a hot one. It's amazing how quickly the whole area has greened up already. We passed the 900 mile mark also. It's in a different place than my 2013 trail guide shows. There is always new trail being built or rerouted. The mileage on my journal is higher because it includes the 300 miles I've done up north.

He and his wife have been great help to me and my thoughts will be with them as they work through this. Two things stick out from today's hike. First, there were many Japanese tourists on the trail today. One group had a boom box playing. They asked me if I wanted beers. I told them it was a bit early, but thanks. I also have a family tenting next to me this evening from somewhere else. We can't even communicate enough to figure that out (Belarus). The other thing from today's hike was the wildlife. I saw countless squirrels and several deer. The deer are so tame, you almost have to push them out of the way. Here's the kicker. Papaw hiked the entire AT without seeing a bear. Mere hours after he leaves, yep, I saw a bear. He's gonna love that. It seems they've been having trouble with a bear coming up to the shelter here at night. It seems to be very common to see several a day in this area. I have decided that Harpers Ferry will be my goal for this section hike's ending point.

Two guys from South Carolina, and one from Toronto thru hiking, and several section hikers from - New Jersey and Chicago. The man from Chicago is working on an acting career and played The Prophet in the outdoor drama Tecumseh, near where I live, in 2005. Toward the end of my hike I turned a corner and there stood a huge red Doberman, with no owner in site. I tried to talk to him, but he was in attack mode. Finally the owner comes into view and races after him, telling me ""he won't hurt you."" Apparently he didn't read the leash rules at the beginning of the trail. Shortly after I arrive at the shelter, here comes the same dog toward the shelter (on a leash this time). The owner leads him over and let's him lay down in the drinking water spring.

One of the highlights was walking through some meadows. It's always nice to get out of the trees for a while. It seemed that there was even more wildlife than normal today. So much so, that I decided it would be a good thing to select an animal of the day. Nominated were squirrels, deer, various birds, toads, a frog, garter snake, lizard of some sort, rabbits, and chipmunks. I was all set to select the rabbit for animal of the day, until I reached the shelter where I planned to stop. While looking at all the available tent sites, I looked down by my foot, and there was a Copperhead snake. That is the reason for my marathon.

We hit the trail at about 7:45. It was one of those days when what you wore depended on which side of the mountain you were on. I went between short sleeves and fleece 4 times. This was our last full day in Pennsylvania, and she bid us farewell by throwing every type trail she had at us. I won't miss all the rocks, but the views we had along the way made it worth it. It's all part of the adventure. We met a few more southbounders today, so they are still coming. We saw another deer and squirrel as well. Water continues to be an issue. Our guide said there was water at the next shelter today, which was about 13 miles. Of course, there was none, so we decided to keep hiking. We met a southbound dayhiker a couple hours later and he said we were almost to Delaware Water Gap (town). That was all it took. We headed out and did another 20 mile day which was rewarded with a bed and breakfast. We are now clean and full, and ready to head into New Jersey tomorrow. Until next time.

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551237,"After hustling into Delaware Water Gap yesterday, we rented a room at the Deer's Head Inn. The first order of business was showers, then food. We'd have to pay a cover charge at the Inn to eat, so we headed down the street to a diner. We had a nice meal and refreshments. This morning the Inn didn't open for breakfast until 8:00 so we walked to a store to buy some hiker food. After a nice breakfast, we headed for New Jersey. The trail led across the very long I - 80 toll bridge. The state line was actually painted on the bridge sidewalk. I was anxious to experience what New Jersey is like. The only time I've ever been there was on a train ride from Newark Airport, and I wasn't impressed. My initial experience, however, has been very positive! Most days out here kind of blend together and are forgettable, but today is one I will remember. The entrance into the NJ trail was beautiful, and while some of Pennsylvania's rocks have found their way across the state line, it wasn't that bad. We soon came to Sunfish Pond. It is a glacial pond that has an acidic mixture that only allows a couple species of fish to survive. We rock-hopped around it and passed a couple rock gardens created by hikers. Pictures of these, and many other things are in the photo section. The mountains are turning into more rolling hills now. We spent the whole day walking down a single ridge, watching everything far below in the valley. There were several huge lakes, and we even saw a man mowing hay - in November! Maybe I better get home and go for a 4th cutting. Other things we saw today were - a tow plane pulling gliders right over our heads, a fire tower, and a swamp. We also walked through several Rhododendron tunnels. We passed two more southbounders finishing their hikes, and had breakfast with a young couple finishing theirs as well. Water continues to be an issue. We are camped at a campsite tonight, and couldn't cook because we are low on water. Can't wait to see what NJ has in store for us tomorrow. Until next time.

We hit the trail at first light and made pretty good time on mostly good trail. There are still some rocks here and there. While today's trail wasn't as spectacular as yesterday, it wasn't bad. We still saw several huge lakes, and one of them had some impressive houses built around it. We saw another fire tower, and some Pine and Hemlock trees. Water, or the lack thereof, dominates the discussion whenever hikers meet on the trail. This is a great help, but there basically is none. Around noon we came to the road at Culver's Gap. We headed into town in search of water. As luck would have it, there sat Gyp's Tavern! They had a sign directing hikers to the back. When we went in, the barmaid told us to bring all our water containers to the bar and she would fill them up (before we could even ask). She also told us to help ourselves to the electrical outlets for charging. What else could a hiker ask for - oh yea, food and refreshments! We had a burger and a couple drinks, which was long enough for the Giants to score two touchdowns, much to the delight of the bar patrons. If you're planning to hike through this area, be sure to drop in. They are very hiker friendly and had great food. We are camped in our tents by a shelter tonight. No one else is here yet.

I had checked the Pennsylvania gun season dates, but forgot about NJ. So it is the first day of a two week black powder season. We put on all the orange clothing we had and hoped for the best. Kind of sympathize with the deer now. We did have a lot of rocks today. My feet feel like they did in Pennsylvania. Around noon we arrived at the High Point State Park Headquarters. We were able to get water and charge our phones for a bit. After leaving there we came to a monument that sits atop the highest point in NJ (thus the name High Point State Park). Soon after leaving there we began dropping down off the mountain. We eventually spent a lot of time going around hayfields. The highlight was probably the end of the day. The guide book mentions ""The Murray Property"" as a place that allows hikers to stay. We did 18 miles to get here and boy was it worth it (see video under the video tab on the left). There is a building to stay in, water hydrants, electric, and a privy.

We decided to make a cup of coffee before we left, then said goodbye to the donkeys and took off at 7:00. We soon came to the road leading to Unionville, NY and headed in to grab some breakfast and resupply. We did this at Horler's Store. Seemed to be a popular spot with the locals. Heading back out, we had very nice trail. We went about a mile around a nature preserve. We saw several ducks and hawks. After that, the trail changed. We started going up and down mountains. Around 1:00 we came to a swamp with a very nice elevated (about 3') wooden walkway winding back through it. It ended up being about a mile long with an impressive bridge in the middle. At the end of the walkway, we began the approach to Wawayanda Mountain. We could see it from far away, and it took quite a while to get there. We walked through a field of cows and calves. It must have been feeding time because they headed across in front of us for the barn. After we waited for them to cross, we continued to the mountain. Just like at the swamp, there were people everywhere. The mountain looked like it was going to be a challenge, but I noticed very young kids headed up with their parents. Hmmm. When we started up, I understood. While it's an imposing mountain, and definitely a long climb, steps had been built into it out of rock practically the whole way. Very impressive. Once we reached the top and headed down, the crowd was gone. We stopped at Wawayanda Shelter and are staying in the shelter because rain is predicted at 8:00, so we aren't taking any chances.

We were on the trail by 7:00 and almost immediately it started raining. It rained most of the day, and still is, but never very hard. Within about a half hour, I crossed into the Big Apple, my 12th state. She greeted us with boulder scrambles/climbs most of the day. Rain and boulders are not a good combination. Both of us took a couple spills, but nothing broke and we stayed on top of the mountain. Aside from a couple small board walks, that's what we did all day. The clouds and fog blocked the views. We are between shelters, so we are tenting by the trail. Had to set up in the rain which is never fun. We will have reached our goal of Bear Mountain on Friday. A little earlier than planned, but that's a good thing. My son, who is an 07 West Point grad, is coming up to the Academy on Saturday, and will be taking us back, so everything worked out great.

A very narrow gap between two huge rocks, through which you can only pass by dragging your pack behind you. I posted a video of Papaw knocking it out like a pro. After not seeing a single person yesterday, we saw one single hiker and two groups today. One looked to be sixth graders, and the other Japanese adults. We also saw three deer, two of which weren't the least bit scared of us. We are in our tents tonight outside William Brien Memorial Shelter.

We climbed three mountains before reaching the Bear Mountain Recreation Area where this section will end. At the top of Black Mountain, the first, we were able to see the NYC skyline, which was really neat. After that, we crossed the four lane Palisades Parkway. The second climb, up West Mountain, was a tough one. We got our first glimpse of Bear Mountain and the Bear Mountain Bridge on its summit. The third climb was Bear Mountain. While it was a long one, the trail was amazing. There were steps on all inclines, and smooth trail between. Probably the best trail I've seen. Bear Mountain is a popular tourist spot, and you can actually drive up it. The first thing we did was hit the vending machines. There is a tower as well where you can get a better view of NYC.

I have two sections left, and we decided to do the Bear Mountain, NY to Manchester Center, Vt one this time. We drove to within a couple hours of Bear Mountain and got a hotel room. We were able to watch the Cavs beat The Warriors at a local establishment. We got to Bear Mountain around 9:00 this morning, ready to go, and as soon as we pulled in the parking lot, the truck overheated. The Rangers called us a tow truck and we got it loaded up. The driver told Papaw that it couldn't be fixed until Monday. Papaw tells him, ""no problem, I don't need it for a couple weeks.""  We finally got on the trail around 11:00.

I struck up a conversation with them and found that they both graduated with and knew my son at West Point. One had actually been his roommate.

As usual, I was on the trail at 5:30, ready to hike the 13 miles to where Papaw was meeting me for resupply. The trail was very good and I made good time. I passed one shelter and stopped at the next for a break. Reading through the shelter journal I came across and entry telling of a bear entering camp at 4:00 am and tearing down a bear bag that had obviously been hung too low. The bear ignored hikers screaming at him. Not a good situation. Bears will keep returning if rewarded with food. There has been bear trouble in the whole area. I saw a bear track yesterday and skat today, but still no bear. I met Papaw and resupplied. We also made plans for pickup tomorrow. He was doing trail magic again as well. After leaving him, I headed up and over Stratton Mountain. It was a beautiful day and good trail, so it was an enjoyable climb and descent. On top there is a caretaker and a fire tower. The view from the tower was great. Stratton Mountain has special meaning to AT community. It's peak is where Benton MacKaye conceived the idea for the AT. After reaching the bottom of the mountain it was time to look for a place to tent. I came upon beautiful Stratton ""Pond,"" looked to my left and there was a tent platform!  Good enough for me. This is probably the neatest place I've ever tented. I have an easy 10 mile hike in the morning to meet Papaw and wrap up this section. Rain is in the forecast again. Maybe I can outhike it. I'll have one more entry tomorrow to wrap things up. Until Next time ...","

If I only had a fishing pole!  Many thru hikers form what are called trail families. They travel as a group and act as a family. One such group this year numbers 10, and has been around us most of the way. They are an interesting group. They arrived at the lake around 7:00 last night and began a ""family"" discussion about various things. This went on until finally the littlest lady in the group raised her voice and told them how it was going to be. I had a good night's sleep, hearing only an owl and loon. I left at 5:15, for the 10 mile trip to the road where Papaw was waiting to pick me up. I made it by 9:15. We went to the motel for a shower, then headed to the laundromat. After that, we went to a restaurant to catch up on some calories. One of the funniest things I've seen out here involves a pigeon. Every time Papaw parks his truck at the hotel, this pigeon lands on his truck cap and becomes very territorial. I go out to get a video of this and he (the pigeon) attacked me. Check out this and many other pictures in the photo section. Papaw had two days to look around the area (Bennington, Vt), and asked me what I'd like to see. I thought it would be interesting to see Robert Frost's gravesite, so we did. We will head back to Virginia tomorrow. Hopefully I will get to spend some time with aunt Linda, who shuttled me around Virginia last year. Sunday I board Amtrak for the trip back to Ohio. This has been a very productive trip. We covered 250 miles in 2 weeks. I have now covered the entire trail up to Rt 17 in Maine, leaving me 230 to complete the trail. I'm not sure yet how the last section will be done, but have some ideas. I'd like to thank all of my readers. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them. Thanks to my wife and dad for keeping the farm going; thanks to my sister for her work posting my journal. I turned it all over to her this time. I just wrote it and sent it to her.

As usual, the most difficult part of section hiking is transportation to and from the trail. I made contact with a man (Brett) that was driving to Maine to hike the 100 Mile Wilderness with another group. I asked if he could drop me off at Rt 17 on his way. He said would, and would enjoy the company. So, yesterday, my parents drove me up to northern Ohio to meet up with him, then he drove through the night (900 miles) and I was able to start hiking (though quite tired) at 11:00 am. Now, the getting home part. My hiking partner,  Papaw, couldn't make it this time, but asked if he could drive up, summit Katahdan with me, then drive me back to Virginia where I could catch the train home. Heck yea!  Then my sister tells me that some of our family wants to visit my aunt in Virginia and they could maybe work it out to drive me home from Virginia. So there ya go, nothing to it. Really, I appreciate all the help I've gotten over the last five years of this hike. Now, about today's hike. Took off at 11:00 hoping to make 15 miles, so I had to get after it. The rain, which was a sure thing two days ago, was pretty much called off, so I was happy about that. So, naturally it did rain during the hike, and is currently pouring as I type this in my tent. The trail was pretty good though. Much better than Vermont was five weeks ago. There were some tough ups and downs, but nothing too long. I didn't have any northbounders (nobos) pass me, but met several southbounders (sobos). I passed two ponds that had boats and canoes available, but I didn't have time for a ride. I stopped at the Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to for lunch and talked with a sobo named ""Canvass."" He got a late start but feels like he's ready to pick up the miles now. I was able to make the 15 miles, but my legs were protesting. It usually takes 3-4 days before they start feeling better. I'm at the Piazza Rock Lean-to. It is a couple miles up Saddleback Mountain, which I will continue up another 4 miles in the morning. It goes above treeline which is always neat to see. I did see one moose track on the trail today, but no moose to go with it. I don't have service here tonight, but hopefully I can send this from atop Saddleback in the morning. Until next time.","

Now I know if I want a good night's sleep, all I have to do is drive 1100 miles through the night, hike 15 miles in the Maine mountains, then sleep in a tent. I only woke up once, which was to water the lillies, then woke up to daylight. Can't remember the last time that happened. I packed my wet tent and was on the trail at 6:15. I had four miles and 2000 ft to the top of Saddleback Mountain. Saddleback and The Horn, which followed, were over 4000 foot and above treeline. I enjoy being above tree line. Today there were no views. I was in the clouds with a lot of wind. The last mountain of the day was Saddleback Junior. Junior was smaller, but a lot harder to climb. Today's climbs were tough, with a lot of technical climbing. I only saw one other hiker all day. I stopped at the Poplar Ridge Lean-to for a break. I met a lady who is a fellow retired 8th grade science teacher, and a sobo who is packing a camping chair and taking pictures of all the nobos he meets, sitting in it. I was glad to ablige while eating a snack. In 2013, when I started this adventure, a lady named Geraldine Largay went missing on the trail and wasn't discovered for two years. The Poplar Ridge Shelter is the last place anyone saw her alive. A fellow hiker had taken her picture, and that picture is hanging inside the shelter. There is a big storm moving in and most hikers are holed up in shelters and hostels waiting it out. I stopped early so I would be prepared when it hits. So far nothing has happened and it's almost 5:00. There have been several hikers pass me since I stopped. Tomorrow is another tough day, with 3 more mountains above 4000 ft.

My hopes for a good night's sleep didn't go so well. I woke up ready to go, and it was only 1:00. Naturally my gear was soaked when I packed up, but I was ready and headed out by 6:30. The stream I camped by is the first I've come to that required fording. When I got there last night, there were boulders all the way across which allowed for a dry crossing. With the rain coming I wanted to camp on the north side in case the water rose. There was only one spot that would work, and in was on the south side. Well, you probably know what's next. When I headed down to cross this morning, you couldn't even see the boulders. And to make matters worse, while I was getting everything ready for a ford, one of my water bottles fell into the water. I grabbed for it, and touched it, then watched it float down the stream. I don't think I need three of them anyway. The first place I tried to ford got too deep, so I tried another. This spot worked fine. Water did get half way up my shorts, but I had no trouble walking. The trail for the first 2-3 hrs was great and I made some good miles. After that I encountered some steep climbs and descents, and technical climbing. I went over Lone, Spaulding, South Crocker, and North Crocker Mountains. I passed and talked to several Day hikers, nobos (passing me), and sobos. By the time I got over the last mountain I was shot. Part way down the mountain I found a spring with a flat spot big enough for my tent and made it home. It is rather chilly this far up. It's probably in the 40s.

Finally talked myself out of the sleeping bag and hit the trail at 6:30. I knew right away that my legs were dead, and today wasn't a good day for that. I had a lot of elevation gain through the Bigelow Mountains to deal with. The sign warning people to take it seriously said there would be a total gain of 6000 ft. I think it was at least that!  The big reward is Avery Peak, but there were 3 climbs before you get there. I did manage to get there, and WOW, was it worth it. It was the most incredible view I've had in 2000 miles!  Oh yea, I crossed the 2000 mile mark today!  The distance of the trail actually changes every year due to relocations here and there. There were actually two different 2000 mile markers, so I'm good. Or .... does it mean I've done 4000 miles?  Sometimes it feels like it. There were a lot of people on the trail today. Avery Peak is a popular destination for hikers. The most interesting people I met was a young sobo couple that had a Beagle and a coonhound. I commented to the man that he was ready to hunt anything. He replied ""we don't go hungry!""  After I reached Avery Peak, I suddenly felt great and decided to come all the way down. It's funny how the body can change like that. I'm in a campground full of teenagers. They are having a good time doing what teenagers do. The trail gets a bit easier tomorrow.

Other than a few tent-to-tent conversations, things quieted down very early which led to a good night's sleep. When I woke up this morning it was still raining. As soon as I packed up what I could inside my tent, as if on queue, it stopped. It never did rain again and we had a beautiful sunny day. My first task was climbing over Little Bigelow Mountain. There was some rock climbing, but it wasn't too bad, and only 4 miles. I did take a tumble on a wet boulder slab and left a bit of skin up there, but everything still works. After I got to the bottom, the trail leveled off for most of the rest of the day. It was a nice break after climbing for several days. It also allowed for a big mileage day. I met several hikers today, the most interesting of which, was a family of four with two young children that are hiking the entire trail southbound. They plan to finish by December. They were a very nice family and the kids seemed really excited about the trip. Since we were at a lower elevation today, I did see a couple snakes. There were a few mosquitos too, but they really weren't too bad. Tonight I'm at the Pierce Pond Lean-to. This shelter also has a sad history. A few years ago a young hiker arrived at this shelter and went for a swim and drowned. I remember it well because I had been following the journal of one of the hikers that was with the group. I remember that the group left for the funeral then returned to complete their hikes. It is a very nice setting with the pond right in front of the lean-to. It made for a nice sunset this evening. Tomorrow, first thing, I get to go for a canoe ride!  Four miles in I will come to the Kennebec River. It is too dangerous to ford, since an upriver dam lets out water without notice. Because of this, a ferry service is provided. It runs from 9:00am to 2:00pm. I should be there in line when it starts. I'm told that there is a white blaze painted on the bottom of the canoe to make it official. Had a nice conversation with the group at the shelter tonight. A few of them are from Ohio.

I panic, thinking I'm missing breakfast. I broke camp in record time and headed toward the camp. Only then did I think to look at my watch. 6:00.

She rowed in front, the canoe guy in the back, and I took pictures. I asked canoe guy if there was anyplace in town to get breakfast. He suggested I try the Bed and Breakfast/Hiker Hostel. I walk in the hostel and asked the owner if he served breakfast. He says ""I have pulled pork and milkshakes.""  I said ""that'll work!""  Boy was it good.

On the way down, I got sidetracked once again by blueberries. They are abundant on exposed areas of the mountains, and I've taken full advantage. I was up and down the mountain in 2.5 hrs. The rest of the day was relatively flat Trail, so once again I had a twenty mile day. I did have an interesting interaction with a couple squirrels today.

I stopped at a shelter to have some lunch and he was there by himself cooking something over a blazing fire. We talked about several things, then he mentioned the trail magic place I would pass about 3 miles further. He told me that he had had blueberry pancakes there this morning, then added (in my best Czech accent) ""you know we put the blueberries on top of pancake, I think they put them in dough (batter).""  I told him that I, also, had had blueberry pancakes this morning at Shaw's Hostel. He says ""Do they put the blue berries in the dough?""  I told him ""Yes.""  He smiles and says ""America is a wonderful country!""  Now, folks, we have problems with several countries around the world right now.  I think it's time that we make sure they are all aware that we put the blueberries in our pancake dough!  Until next time.","ME 15, Monson, Shaw's

My first night here, Visa and I went to a watering hole down the street to celebrate his completion of the trail. There were many hikers there celebrating the same. The atmosphere was very happy and emotional because there were trail families that had been together for long periods of time, telling stories of their hike, and saying their goodbyes before heading off to different parts of the country/world. We ate at the AT Cafe several times. It is actually owned by the owners of the hostel where I'm staying. It is a neat place. The ceiling panels are signed by hikers that have completed the trail. I added mine 5.1 miles early, but I'll make good on it tomorrow. There is also an ice cream eating challenge that includes 4.5 lbs of ice cream. While I do love ice cream, I decided to pass. I had a long conversation with Ole Man, the owner of the hostel. He told me the story of the how he came to own the hostel after staying here on his thru hike several years ago. He expects to eclipse the 3000 guests mark this season. The peak season is about to start. I talked to another hiker that came back to the US and hiked the AT after spending several years in South Korea teaching English and doing proof reading. There was a man here from Portugal that always had everyone laughing. He left this morning heading to the Grand Canyon for more hiking. Finally, there was Visa. We hit it of well and spent a lot of time together around town. I asked him soon after I met him how he was getting home. He told me that he was flying. He then confided in me that HE was flying home. He didn't want everyone to know that he had his Cirrus airplane at the Millinocket Airport. That is how he has gotten back and forth doing his section hikes.  He has done quite well in the business world and shared many stories of how he did it. I went out to the airport with him this morning to check out the plane. It's definitely very nice. I even did FaceTime with my son who is a pilot as well, and Visa talked with him about the Cirrus. After Visa took off, I noticed a group of people preparing for a parachute jump. I decided to check it out. It was a business that offers a rafting trip and a tandem parachute jump package deal. They were on hold because of clouds, so I talked with the pilot and he gave me a tour of a couple more planes. After several hours, they cancelled for the day and I walked back to Millinocket. So, as you can see, it's been a great 3 day break. Papaw is stopping by the hostel and picking up a well rested Bazinga at 6am tomorrow, and we're gonna go finish this thing. The weather is supposed to be great!  For the last time - Until next time.","

Bazinga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575770,"You know how when you are anticipating a big event in the future, and the reality often fails to live up to what you imagined it to be?  Well, that didn't happen today. My summit of Katahdan, was much more than I ever imagined it would be. Papaw and his lovely wife planned to pick me up at the hostel this morning at 6:00 am. I was up and ready by 5:30, and waiting by the curb. It was great to see them again. We headed to Baxter State Park for our date with the big mountain. We had a bit of a wait in traffic getting through the gate, but were ready to head up at 7:30. Mrs Papaw even hiked part of the way with us. After a mile or two of nice trail, it headed upward. We encountered a lot of rock climbing most of the rest of the way. It was a blast. I loved every minute of it. It was a beautiful day as well, so we had the greatest views, by far, of the entire trail. My words and pictures cannot begin to express what I witnessed up there. We made it to the top in about 3 hours. I recorded my final steps to the famous Katahdan sign marking the peak and end of my 2,185 mile journey. As I got close, I began to hear people shouting Bazinga!  That surprised me because I wasn't sure who was there that knew me. I finally realized it was my two friends from Georgia I met several days ago. They recognized me, then other hikers joined in. Next came a round of congratulations amongst all the hikers and a lot of picture taking. We stayed up top for about 30 minutes, then headed back down. We had a great time heading down as well. We met several hikers still coming up. Some were not too crazy about continuing. It took about 3 hours to get down as well, but we spent a lot of time waiting for hikers coming up. I'm now headed south on I95 toward Virginia. I will visit my Aunt again after I get there, then take Amtrak back to Ohio on Wednesday. What an adventure it's been these last 5 years and 13 section hikes. I owe so much to so many people for allowing me to do this. You don't just leave a cattle farm for 2-3 weeks without a lot of support at home. My Wife and Dad pretty much covered that. I basically typed my Journals and sent them to my Sister and she took care of all the postings. My Aunt Linda and Son shuttled me up through Virginia - New York. I traveled in excess of 17,000 miles to and from the trail in cars, buses, planes, and trains. All these people have gotten me to and from these modes of transportation. The last person I want to thank is Papaw. I was so glad he could summit with me today. He has gone out of his way for five years to help me finish this hike. It's amazing to think that my biggest help out here was someone that I didn't even know when I started. That is the amazing thing about the AT; you developed great friendships very quickly. I have enough memories from this adventure to last the rest of my life. To those of you that think you'd like to give it a try, I encourage you to do so. The trail is going to kick your butt repeatedly, but the good times and good friends are what you will leave with in the end. Finally, thanks to all of you that have followed my journey and offered encouragement along the way. It really does mean a lot when you are reading it in your tent after being rained on all day. This time there will be no next time. Thanks, Bazinga!","
