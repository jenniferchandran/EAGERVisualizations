Sandbag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517031,"I am a 6 ft 4 husband. A 190lb bigger little brother. A hzl eyed brunette haired son.I am not a blogger. I should say, I have never blogged. I feel this is a good chance to share my experiences building up to and during one of the greater adventures in my life. I have had a few great adventures. All of them had this calling to me. My first, massage school, in short was pack up everything get on a greyhound and check in. A year later out popped a massage therapist. That was 13 years ago. Then i met the woman to be my wife. That was '06. Four years later i got on one knee in a parking lot in front of Kohl's. The next April the knot was tied. It took me five years to discover i need this experience. A sobo through hike on the AT. 100 days. 21.8 average miles per day. 4500 gain / loss a day. Better prepare.I have not discovered my trail name that goes here.",,Who am i?,"Nov 07, Sat",0

Sandbag,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517060,"Lots of choices to make. Took me 3 weeks to decide a long term trial of Salomon's XA Pro 3D. Finding them in wide was a bit of effort as well. 40 miles of hiking and 90 hrs or so of DT massage. They seem nice so far. But what about sleeping. I like the efficiency of tarp tents or bivys. still deciding and wont spend the money until next spring when i get my sleeping bag and decide if i should use a ""mattress"". Gravity water filter seems most useful and yet again becomes a purchase next spring as money becomes more available. Single burner camp cooker. white gas? Alcohol? i don't know. need more investigation. Food. How to keep a clean and caloric sustainable diet while exerting 4k calories a day or more. Ug, more beer.",,Hunting for Gear,"Nov 08, Sun",0
