Theoretically, I could do the Appalachian Trail again in 2017, if I just save up enough between now and then.Who's with me?!?",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Tue",0
DirtyGirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441519,"Met up for dinner with Mr. Right, Daniel Holloway, who hiked the AT Nobo in 2009.Daniel and I worked together at the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival in 2007. Then he and his girlfriend Amanda (""Plunger"") hiked the trail in 2009. We worked together again in 2010 where he asked me if I would ever consider hiking the Appalachian Trail as a fundraiser for HIV/AIDS. I took up his challenge and his idea inspired my 2011 John Muir Trail and 2012 Appalachian Trail hikes!While it is still very early (three and a half years away), we discussed the possibility of hiking the AT Nobo again in 2017.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Mon",0

It is exciting to be in the planning stages for 2017.I am hoping that I can hike in 2017 with Mr. Right, but it would also be interesting to see who else comes along for the adventure.",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Fri",0
