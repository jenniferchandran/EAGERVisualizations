Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568318,"I'm preparing to pick up on the AT where I got off last year, at the 
Delaware Water Gap.  My plan is to complete the AT this year - NJ to 
Maine.   I pulled all my gear out today and packed my pack to make sure I
still had everything.  The only thing that has changed noticeably is 
the waistband adjustment; I've grown since I unloaded my pack last 
September.  Its exciting to be getting back on, and a bit intimidating. 
Getting back in trail shape is something I'm looking forward to with a 
healthy dose of intrepidation.  I lost 20 pounds on my hike last year, 
and I'm proud to report that I only gained 30 of it back.
I'll be rejoining the trail next Monday, June 19th.  It will be a 
little different this year, I'll have a trail partner for the first 
month.  My nephew Shaun, an Eagle Scout and college sophomore, will be 
joining me until he has to go back to college.  I call him Sherpa,and I 
expect my pack load to be considerably lighter for the month that he is 
with me.
Completing Pennsylvania last year was a major relief, I had pulled 
off in Pine Grove Furnace in July for a family event and wasn't able to 
get back on the trail until mid-August due to family needs.  I tried to 
decide whether I should get back on in Connecticut and continue up to 
Maine, with the promise of coming back this year and completing 
Pennsylvania to Connecticut.  In the end, I decided it would be very 
anticlimactic to finally complete the AT at some roadside in Connecticut
- no, I wanted to complete it on Katahdin the way it was meant to be 
completed.  I therefore returned to Pine Grove Furnace, PA where I had 
gotten off and continued on to complete that state.  
This year, I start with a new beginning, at the New Jersey border and continue to Maine to complete my quest.",,"Cape Cod, MA","Jun 12, Mon",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568660,"Today was gear day.  Time to clean everything up, test it out and get it ready for packing.  I made a quick run into REI a few things and tried to resist picking up any additional things to carry.    I've been trying hard not to add any additional ""gadgets"", no matter how cool they look.  I picked up a bottle of Permetherin so that I could treat my clothes once again.  So far I haven't had a single tick, so I'm giving it credit for that.I've also been trying to catch upon trailjournals to see where people are.",,"Cape Cod, MA","Jun 13, Tue",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568664,"I had never tried Yoga before but I was around several very successful thru hikers that practiced it while on the trail.  I decided to give it a try so I've attended a few classes this past week to try it out and increase my flexibility. Unfortunately I think I bruised my foot while doing one of the exercises where you sit back on your feet.  Nothing too serious, but the top of my right foot (1st metatarsal) is quite sore.   Old age is hell!  Its got 4 days to heal up!",,"Cape Cod, MA","Jun 14, Wed",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568896,"I very much wish I could say I spent the day refining my gear, getting rid of a few more pounds, and getting in a practice hike.  No, the day was spent trying to prepare the house for me being gone for 3+ months.  I am actually planning a rather leisurely hike this summer, broken up up with a few off trail activities.  I'll be getting in at Delaware Water Gap on Monday the 19th and will hike for a month.  I will then get off and fly to Oshkosh, WI for Airventure, the world's largest fly-in.  Then back to the trail for about 3 weeks when I once again get off for the total solar eclipse August 21.  The eclipse won't be very good in New England so I'm flying back to Kansas where it will be total.  Then back to the Trail for the final push to Katahdin, hopefully for a mid-September completion.   As always there are lots of ifs on the Trail, it's easy to suffer an injury that can knock you off. Is getting off the trail like that ruining the Appalachian Trail experience?  For me it doesn't, I have a lot of interests and being able to satisfy them make me even more appreciative of the Trail experience and access to the AT.  In the end, I'd like to say that yes, I walked 2189.2 miles.",,"Cape Cod, MA","Jun 16, Fri",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569147,"Father's Day is back to the Trail day.  We got up at 4:30 am to catch a 5:40 bus to Boston.  From Boston, Shaun and I took a train to New York City and then another bus to Delaware Water Gap, PA.  While in New York we walked around some to show Shaun Times Square, got some real NY pizza, and then walked over to the Empire State Building.  We splurged and got tickets for the 102nd floor observation deck.   We were typical tourists, except we were wearing 30 pound packs.  The views from the Observation Deck were awesome and we made several circuits around taking pictures and taking in the views.  While the 102nd floor was impressive, the historical displays on the 80th floor were also impressive.  To think that it only took 6 months to erect the building to the 86th floor is just mind boggling.  As an engineer, it is so inspiring that these structures were designed using slide rules and brute force.  Of course they didn't have email to distract them. 
We arrived Delaware Water Gap around 7 pm and dropped our stuff at the hiker hostel run by the Church of the Mountain.  We walked down the street to the Sycamore Grill and had a spectacular dinner. I had to go back to the Sycamore, that's where I celebrated finishing the rocks of Pennsylvania last year.
Tomorrow we get back on the trail, we'll I get back and Shaun gets his first taste of long distance hiking.  Rain is forecast, so we'll see how it goes.   It's good to be back.",,Delaware Water Gap,"Jun 18, Sun",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569271,"I slept on the couch in the hostel as all the bunk spots were taken.  I had had Shaun grab the last spot and I took the couch when we got in last night.  I slept pretty well considering the couch was about 6 inches too short, either my head or my head had to jut up at an angle.  I woke at 7 and got Shaun up.  We packed our packs in the dark as the other hikers were still asleep.  We decided to try the Apple Pie Bakery for breakfast and had a town meal to start our hike.  A hot dog and Apple Pie for $2.95!  
After breakfast it was time to get hiking.  Heavy rain and thunderstorms were forecast and a lot of hikers were taking a zero day to avoid the storms.  We walked on the I-80 bridge over the Delaware River and came to the PA/NJ border where I had stopped last year.  I ceremoniously stepped over the border into my next state and Shaun took my picture.  I took his as well and we were off into new territory for our AT experience.  In actuality crossing the bridge is annoying given all the traffic and noise and we were glad when we got off it.  
We stopped at the Kittatinny Visitor Center and talked to the rangers.  The weather still called for heavy rain and thunderstorms, but we thought we would give it a go anyway.  We climbed up from the river valley and into the quiet of the forest.  It was a relief to once again be away from the noise of the interstate and on my way to Maine.  The climb up from the river was fairly moderate and only about 1100 feet, but that didn't keep my lungs and legs from complaining.  I was definitely out of Trail shape.  Shaun was doing better being 40 years younger and 40 pounds lighter!   We continued through small ups and downs and watched the sky turn dark and heard thunder in the distance.  A few brief rain showers blew through and that helped to cool things off.  The humidity was killing us and the temps were well into the 80s.
We had lunch at the Douglas Trail junction and decided we would stop at the Mohican Outdoor Center approximately 5.3 miles away. It would make for a short day but being in a bunk room was preferable to being in a tent with the weather coming in.  We met Wanderer and his dog Gal while we were eating lunch.  He was hiking the trail and living out of his van.  Each day he would hike out, and then hike back and sleep in his van.
We took off after lunch and passed Sunfish Pond and continued up to Kittatinny Mountain.  We had great views all around and an ominous view of the dark clouds headed our way.  We met Valley Forge at the peak as he was hustling down to the Mohican as well.  The rain started in earnest and the thunder got more aggressive.  Coming down the mountain the rocks were getting slick from the rain and we were being as cautious as possible.  We arrived at a road after 2.5 wet miles and turned toward the Mohican.  There was a good crowd of hikers there all escaping the thunderstorms.  We got a room and were amazed at how nice the facility was.  Our ""bunk room"" had 4 rooms with 4 bunks each, a huge common area, full kitchen, 4 bathrooms with showers, and a fireplace - it was palatial for $24 each.  For dinner we had fresh made sandwiches from the deli, then retired to our bunk room where Shaun made a fire so we could dry our clothes out.  We were sharing the bunk room with Jeff and Wise Wolf.
It definitely wasn't roughing it, but Shaun was getting an AT experience, and I was on my way to Maine once again.","Delaware Water Gap

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569443,"I awoke about 5 am and went over to the main lodge as Shaun was sleeping in our room and Jeff was sleeping in the living room.  Noodles was in the main lodge packing and so I settled into the comfy leather couches and used the wifi to catch up on the ""news"".   One of the great features of being on the Trail is that you don't get bombarded with the daily political news!  A few minutes later Valley Forge came in to get an early start on his planned 28 miles.  He's trying finish in 6 weeks.  That's going to require averaging 25 mile days.
I went back about 7 to wake Shaun and get repacked.  We went back to the deli at 8 when they opened and had another ""town"" breakfast.  We finished up and got on the trail by 8:30.  It was a spectacular morning after the storms had passed with cool dry air and bright sunshine.  We climbed up to a high ridge and were treated to some magnificent views, which totally surprised us about New Jersey.  The trail continued along the ridge and the views continued.   There were small ups and downs and some rocks, but nothing like Pennsylvania.
We continued on to Brinks Shelter, continually leap frogging with Noodles and Jeff.  We met a brother and sister hiking team who were from KS, Moxie and Tumbleweed, which was fun as you don't meet too many other Kansans on the AT.  Shaun also got his Trail name, Burps, from his continual burping as we walked.  
We arrived Brinks at 6pm and Just Jeff was the only one there.  A few minutes after we arrived lots of other hikers began showing up - Jinglebutt and Kate, Oh Yeah, Bad News, and Noodles plus several others we didn't know.  The Shelter was full of hikers, and mosquitoes.  We were all slapping and spraying ourselves with bug spray as we bedded down for the night.","Mohican Outdoor Center

It was a tough night of sleeping with the mosquitos in the shelter.  I awoke early and made a trip to the privy at first light.  When I got back Kate was already packing.   She and Jinglebutt were on a schedule and needed to get in 20 miles today.  We ate breakfast, packed, and were on the trail by 7:11.   Culver's Gap was only 3.2 miles away and the trail guide said there was a deli there we could get some sandwiches to go for lunch.  After an easy walk we arrived to find the deli was closed (for 2 years), the gas station had no snacks, it was really a gas station, Gyp's Tavern didn't open until 11, and so we tried the Sporting goods store.  Well at least they had sodas.  Just Jeff showed up a few minutes later to get a soda as well.  We also met Boo Boo who was hitching his way into Branchville 3 miles away for a resupply.  Fueled with a soda, we took off for a short but steep climb of 600 feet up to the top of the ridge.  Nice views, and then a little further we came to a fire tower.  Wanderer came by a few minutes later and had oranges for everybody.  Trail magic!
Most of the rest of the day was a series of small ups and downs, hills and bogs.  We had lunch at Grin Anderson shelter and met up with Boo Boo again.  We climbed Sunrise Mountain and rested at the pavilion there, then down past Mashipacong shelter and on to Rutherford Shelter for the night.  Rutherford is .4 miles off the trail through boggy terrain, so apparently not a popular place.  We were the only one there except for 2 local hikers heading south.  It was actually a nice shelter set in a clearing.  We headed to bed early after a 15 mile day.  Hiker midnight came just as the sun set on the longest day of the year.","Brinks Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569619,"Burps and I both slept really well in our tents.  A combination of exhaustion and no mosquitoes made things much nicer.  We ate breakfast, packed up and were on the trail at 8:30am.  We had numerous small ups and downs until we got to the High Point State Park office about 3 miles away.  The park gives out a free soda to AT hikers and they have bathrooms, water, and a place to dump trash.  All the necessities of Trail life!  Just Jeff was there and we relaxed and compared notes on where we were going next.  We took off and started the climb to High Point monument, the highest point in New Jersey.  (As a reference, it's only 1803 msl, and 40th highest out of 50, so naturally you would want a monument.)
The monument actually is spectacular, an obelisk in the Washington monument style rising 220 feet.  It's quite impressive as you climb the trail toward it.  We reached a wooden observation tower about a half mile from it and took some more pictures and noticed a sign for Lulu's snack bar down at the lake.  Not to miss a chance for real food, I talked Burps into a diversion and we went down a side trail for lunch.  Just Jeff was already there (unplanned) and we ordered our lunch.  A few minutes later O2 and Beer (pronounced Beeya, in the proper Bostonian way) showed up too.  We had met them as we were leaving Delaware Water Gap.
The lake looked really inviting on a hot summer day so I went for a swim.  This is a state park swim area so there were about a thousand kids playing there with Moms sitting on the beach.  I navigated the crowd and went for a nice cooling swim.  Burps had other ideas so he used the bath house showers and got a shower in.   
We dried off in the sun, repacked and headed then for our original objective of High Point monument.  The monument is really quite nice, completed in 1930 as a  monument to War Veterans.  We climbed to the top, 291 steps and had views of three states.  This was Burps first state high point and my 7th.
After our monument adventure, we descended back to the AT and wound our way down the mountain more than 1000 feet.  We had 7 miles to Unionville, NY and the promise of Annabelle's Pizza.  The trail took us through forested lowlands, bogs, swamps, and pastures.  We were going to be in significantly different terrain getting to NY.  We arrive Unionville around 7pm and there was Just Jeff and several other hikers.  We ordered pizza and hung out on the front porch.  Cousin Eddie showed up a few minutes later; we had met her back at the hostel in Delaware Water Gap.  She was from Austin and was a new grad from Baylor.  Our pizzas were excellent and then we all went to the city park across the street to set up camp.  Unionville had turned out to be a great stopping point.","Rutherford Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570732,"I was once again reminded today that no one hikes the Appalachian Trail alone.  We experienced trail magic three times today  and it is a constant reminder of the goodness and generosity of the people along the trail.  As you struggle up a climb, reach a summit, gather water from a spring, or a myriad of other tasks it's easy to think you are doing it on your own, but really there are angels all along the path helping us out.
We started out the day with blinding sunlight streaming through the mist into the shelter.  It rained a lot last night and we were glad to have a dry place to stay.  We could have tented, but staying in the shelter allowed us to not have to deal with wet tents in the morning.  And thankfully the mosquitoes weren't too bad.  Tiger Lily and Reece had opted to tent it, so it was just Burps and I in the shelter.
I retrieved our food bags from the tree and we packed up and ate breakfast.  We said our goodbyes and started down the mountain.  After a relatively short descent we came to the Dover Oak, the largest oak tree on the AT, estimated to be over 300 years old.  As we were admiring the tree a car pulled up and said they were going to be doing trail magic.  This was very exciting even though it was early in the morning and we were fresh.  Cold drinks and snacks are a hiker's dream.  I got an ice cold Mountain Dew and Burps a Gatorade.  
The couple were AT veterans themselves and knew what trail magic meant to hikers.  Sidetracked had done about 750 miles several years ago before be developed back problems.  Miles from Nowhere had almost completed the trail in Maine before she herself developed back problems.  She keeps trying to strengthen her back to complete those last few miles.  These were great people and had driven 45 minutes from their home to set up their magic under the majestic Dover Oak. We took our pictures, said our goodbyes and continued north.
The next few miles were a hikers dream, a mixture of pastures, forests, and boardwalks over swamps provided easy walking, variety, and views.  We came out of the swamp to a railway stop, the Appalachian Trail stop on the Metro-North line out of NYC.  The train only stops here on weekends and holidays, but gives direct public transport to the trail.  Tiger Lily and Reece had come from the city on this train.  We rested on the benches for a few minutes and then continued on to find Native Landscapes, a garden center that specializes in native plants and is hiker friendly.  They offered drinks, ice cream, hiker supplies, showers - all for a fee but also a gazebo to sit in and water and an outside shower for free.  Trail magic once again in another form!
We continued on through more pastures under blue skies and warm sunshine, and came to a road with even more trail magic!  Trail angel Carol had left a tub of watermelon and jugs of water at the road crossing.  We gobbled some watermelon and left our thanks in the trail register.   All this trail magic had slowed us down some, but it was one of those AT experiences you just have to take in and enjoy.  We had gone for weeks without very much trail magic, and now we had a bounty.
We continued on through much of the afternoon with gentle grades, fairly open forests,  a few swamps, clear flowing streams, blue skies and thoughts of this is how we imagined the AT was going to be through New York.  The rocks were behind us and we walked on dirt covered paths.  By mid afternoon we came to the Connecticut border, another state down!  New York had been interesting and we left it on a section of trail we just loved.
We began Connecticut with a few swampy areas and then a big climb up Ten Mile Hill, with nice views from the top.  A quick descent down the river and we were at the Ten Mile shelter.  Decision time- we wanted to go on but the next campsite was 5.5 miles and a big climb away.  I proposed an alternate plan, people food!  We were only 40 minutes or so from Bull's Bridge, which had a nice little tavern.   Let's head there and maybe we can find a place to camp nearby.  (Connecticut only lets AT hikers camp at designated campsites). We agreed and I hustled down the trail while Burps finished getting his water.  Hustled was a bad choice of words, on a very flat and level part of the trail I stumbled over a root and fell flat on my face.  I broke my glasses, ripped a gash in my hand and injured my pinkie finger.  I dusted myself off, took stock, retrieved my broken glasses, and tended to my wounds.  There was nothing to do but continue on so I started walking again.  Burps came up from behind and I showed him the damage.  Argh, how stupid.   We continued on and came to the famed Bull's  Bridge covered bridge (built in 1842).   We passed through and came to the tavern, asked if the ""served our kind"" (stinky Hiker Trash) and they did.   
We had a spectacular meal and asked if there was a place to camp nearby.  The young lady at the bar said the owner lets hikers camp behind the restaurant and so we went out and started setting up our tents as it was starting to rain.  Fireworks started going off in the background as we dove in our tents to the sound of the rain.  A great finish to a great day with the exception of my mishap.  Tomorrow we go into Kent, CT to pick up a mail drop and do a badly needed resupply.

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570803,"We woke up to overcast skies in the field behind the Bull's Bridge Inn.  Our tents were wet from the overnight rain, so I hung up the rain fly to try to get it to dry some.  There was a gas station next door so we went over to it to get some breakfast.  As we ate breakfast the clouds started clearing out and the sun shone through to start drying things out.   We made the decision to road walk into Kent to give us maximum time to resupply and get my mail-drops.  I was concerned that if we hiked the AT to get to Kent we wouldn't get there until mid-afternoon and it would be a rush to get laundry, mail, resupply done before stores closed, and we didn't know what would be open on the 4th.
We took off walking along US 7 to get to Kent, only 4 miles away.  ( 7 miles by the AT trail). We tried hitchhiking but were unsuccessful at getting a ride.  It may seem silly to not enjoy walking along a highway when you are trying to walk 2189.2 miles of trail, but road walking is truly unenjoyable with the noise and the cars rushing by.  About a mile out of town Burps saw a guy working in his garage and went up to him to ask if he would give us a ride.  I would never have thought to do that, but Burps thought it was fun to try.   Chris was a biker looking guy with long hair and a bandanna.  He said sure, no problem and hopped in his car and off we went.  He gave us a nice tour of Kent and dropped us off right at the laundromat.
Kent is set up beautifully with the laundromat, post office and grocery all right together.  We threw our laundry in, got my mail and went to the IGA for food resupply.  My wife had mailed a resupply of freeze dried dinners, and my son had mailed me a surprise treat of Beef Jerky!  A short walk away is the pharmacy, bank, and the new Kent Welcome Center where we were told they have bathrooms and a shower for hikers.  ($2 for 4 minutes of hot water in an outside shower). The shower was amazing, and for the first time in 8 days we had clean clothes and clean bodies!   We then walked down the street for lunch and had great hamburgers at The Villager.  A couple more stops at Sundog Shoes and Annie Bandannies (the outfitter) for supplies and ice cream and we had used up most of the day as I had expected.  It was 5 pm when we walked out of town back to the AT.  
A short road walk back to the AT and a climb up a hill southbound got us to Mt. Algo Shelter.  A beautiful Shelter spot with tall trees and a rushing stream nearby.  Another hiker, Robin, was already set up and a few other hikers came in as we were setting up our tents.  Our plan was to get up in the morning and hitch a ride back to Bull's Bridge and then slackpack (dayhike) back to Mt. Algo where we would leave most of our stuff.  That way we could make up the 7 miles we skipped a lot faster.
We both agreed we needed that Nearo day.   We were able to resupply, get cleaned up, eat some good food, and give our feet a much needed rest.  Independence Day tomorrow!  Let Freedom Ring!","Bull's Bridge, CT

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570890,"I woke up ready to do our slack pack plan from Bull's Bridge back to Mt. Algo Shelter, but that got interrupted.  I had a tent pole break yesterday and contacted LLBean for a replacement.   They were great and were shipping one out to me to Dalton, MA where we would be in a few days.  Last night I had used duck tape to patch the broken tent pole and thought it would hold for a few days.  It didn't.  The aluminum pole was disintegrating and no amount of duck tape was going to hold it.  New plan, I felt a strong need to get those new tent poles as soon as possible and I told Burps we needed to move north.  My tent was useless so I'd be sleeping in shelters or with him in his two person tent until we get to Dalton.  (I'll have to come back later to do those 7 miles, which I thought would be fun on my way back to Kansas in the fall)
We packed up and headed down Mt. Algo, across a field and back up into the hills through pleasant paths.  The trail here was really nice with dirt or leaf covered paths and fairly open forest, the ups and downs were gentle and it was a beautiful day to walk;  it was Independence Day.  There were a fair number of nicely running streams so it made for a great hike.  We ascended Caleb's Peak and had a nice viewpoint for lunch with views of the Housatonic Valley.
After lunch we headed down from the peak and got back to reality, there is a very steep descent down an area called St. John's Ledges.  Reminiscent of Pennsylvania, the path went steeply down for 250 feet through a large jumble of rocks.  The trail continued down the mountain and at the base we were down to a path that paralleled the Housatonic River.  We would follow the river for 5 miles  and it was a nice change, with one exception- gnats!  Swarms of gnats were everywhere.  I finally pulled out my bug net and put in on, I hate wearing it but it beat swatting at gnats.
The day was really pleasant, not too humid and not too hot and we passed a number of dayhikers.  One gentleman had a huge 500mm Nikon lens on his camera and we stopped and talked with him and his wife for a while about the trail, birding, cameras.  (www.canosaphotography.net). You just meet some really interesting people out here.  
We finally left the river path and had an 850 foot climb up Silver Hill.  It was a tough climb, steep and rocky in places.  We passed up the Silver Hill campsite and continued up and over Silver Hill aiming for Breadloaf mountain.  Another steep descent and a sign recommending a mile detour around a swollen stream put us on the side of Breadloaf Mountain.  A short 300 foot climb and we were at the summit with a nice view of the river valley.   The sun had set so we hurriedly set up the tent, bear bag, and started dinner.  As we ate, we could see fireworks going off in the distance, probably Kent 13 miles away.  Happy Independence Day!","Mt.

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571021,"Burps slept in really late and I didn't try to wake him since I thought we had a short day today.  It was a beautiful cool morning with a nice sunrise on top of the mountain.  We packed up but didn't head down Breadloaf Mountain until about 9:30., lulled into complacency that we were only trying to do 11 miles.  The trail and forest was quite nice once again.  We came to Pine Knot Loop Trail and met a lot of dayhikers.  One lady we met proved to be yet another inspiration.  Cathy was an unassuming day hiker who turned out to be an AT 2000 miler!   She had done the whole AT in sections as her schedule would allow.  As we continued to talk to her we also found out she had hiked the entire PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), and after further discussion she admitted she had hiked the CDT (Continental Divide Trail)!   She had down the Triple Crown!   She said she was a slow hiker, but just persisted and added that she knew she needed to be flexible to adjust when the trail or weather were not cooperating.  Cathy was not a big husky hiker, but one whose spirit and passion kept her going when the going got tough.  A real inspiration!
We talked to Cathy way too long, but finally said our goodbyes and headed up the trail.  She had warned us this next section would be tougher, and I really wasn't quite prepared for it.  The trail profile looked like a lot of small continuous climbs and descents, but what it didn't show was that a lot of them were rocky and steep once again.  All afternoon long the trail was up and down a few hundred feet at a time, mostly on rocks.  We crossed several good streams for water, but a number of them were drying up.  The bugs were horrible and I resorted to using my bug net once again.
Finally as the sun was setting I found myself walking along a high ridge and watching a beautiful sunset through the trees.  I descended down to Belter's Campsite as the sky glowed orange in the west.  Burps had gone ahead and set up his tent.  I arrived as it was starting to get dark, exhausted after what should have been a short day.  Never underestimate the AT.","Breadloaf Mountain

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571398,"I woke Burps up at 7, it was only 3 miles to Falls Village, CT where the Toymaker's Cafe was and a good breakfast awaits.  My usual breakfast is to dig in my food bag for a breakfast bar and some pre-cooked bacon.   Burps usually does cold oatmeal and whatever else he can find.   The thought of hot, fresh waffles was very compelling.  We packed up and headed down the mountain.   Burps stopped for water and I continued on knowing he'd catch up with me.  I crossed several roads, walked around a cornfield, along the Housatonic river then along some more roads to cross the Housatonic.  I got to a stoplight where the trail changed directions and decided to wait on Burps.  He's usually much faster and so he should be along by now.   I waited some 15 minutes and I could finally see him down the road.  When he arrived he told me, ""Sorry, I bumped into One Gallon while getting water and we talked a long time"".
One Gallon was a legend out here, he passed us once before in New York, and we had heard about him from a lot of other hikers.  He had started the Florida Trail in Key West on January 1st, and then kept on going up the AT, and reportedly was going up to Canada after Katahdin.  He had zeroed in NYC for a few days and now he was behind us again.
We continued on to Falls Village toward our breakfast and walked along roads and then pine needle covered trails.  The Trail the took along the Housatonic River and the locals had placed benches along this section.  We passed several Day hikers out for morning walks and it was just a beautiful setting.  We arrived Falls Village and it looked like the proverbial small New England town.  Toymaker's Cafe was in a house on Main Street at the end of ""downtown"".  It was a classic and we left our packs on the front porch and went in to what could have been your grandmother's kitchen, but it was the whole downstairs.  There were about half a dozen tables set up and a nice looking lady (Ann) behind a register.  The cook (Greg) was working on a breakfast delicacy.  We grabbed a table and a menu and everything was so tempting it was hard to choose.  I ended up with a hamburger as it was 10am now, Burps ordered a double breakfast.  Toymaker's was a fun place, great food, and Greg and Ann are really interesting people.  In addition to the Cafe, they run a vintage British motorcycle parts business.  I was commenting to Burps that you don't just find places like this along the interstate, you need to get out into the small villages.
After breakfast we headed out of town and came upon One Gallon at the power plant.  They had an outside shower (cold only) on an ivy covered building and a place you could charge your electronics.  One Gallon had just finished his shower and was getting some electrons for his phone.  We talked a bit and then moved on.  Falls Village gets its name from some large waterfalls on the Housatonic, and the trail winds along them.  We were exploring the Falls and getting some pictures when Rabbit and One Gallon came along.  I got a great picture of Rabbit by the Falls.
We continued up Mt. Prospect, and when we got to the top a dayhiker was up there with trail magic!   Mama Lo was packing cold ice tea and oranges and toffee for thru hikers!  We talked quite a while and then continued down the long downhill into Salisbury.  We go to spend all afternoon hearing about One Gallon's adventures.  He had hiked the AT, CDT, and PCT three times already.   This was his fourth AT hike, and he started it with the Florida Trail.  He'll have accumulated over 41,000 trail miles when he finishes the AT this year.  He basically just hikes, a really interesting guy.
We made it into Salisbury which is where I had started a section last year.  We said our goodbyes to One Gallon and Rabbit.  I had booked a room in a local house and tonight we'd be sleeping indoors.  Tomorrow we would be taking a bus up to Lee, MA where I had got off while hiking with my son John last year.  We walked through town to the boarding house and it felt good, I had completed Connecticut.","Belter's campsite

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571399,"Last year I skipped ahead from central Pennsylvania to hike with my son John for a few days in Massachusetts.  I started at Salisbury and met him in Great Barrington and we hiked to Lee.  Later I went back to central Pennsylvania and finished up Pennsylvania.  We had now completed New Jersey through Salisbury, Connecticut and we were ready to move on to Lee, Massachusetts.   I love hiking the AT, but not so much as I wanted to repeat a section I had already done when I'm under a little time pressure. (Getting to VT before Burps had to go home)
Vanessa Bretton runs a ""Hiker boarding house"" in Salisbury where she offers rooms to hikers for $40/night.  She also does Hiker shuttles, so Burps and I booked a room at Vanessa's.  We shared a bunk room with a couple of ladies, Pip and Quickstarter.   They were flip floppers meaning they started in the middle, would hike to Maine, and then flip flop back to where they started and hike to Georgia.
Burps and I arranged a shuttle with Vanessa for 11 to get to North Canaan, CT where we could catch the bus to Lee, MA.  Until then, we spent the morning eating and comparing stories with Pip, Quickstarter, and another hiker that had come in early, Ghosthiker.  When 11 came we piled into her car and rode to North Canaan.  As we were grabbing the stuff from her car at the bus stop, I accidentally left my rain jacket in her car, not realizing until she drove away.  A few frantic calls went unanswered, she didn't have her cell phone.  I got a hold of Pip and she said she would try to get her to bring it when she got back.  Too late though, the bus arrived and I headed north without my rain jacket.  Fortunately the bus stop in Lee was at the Outlet Mall and I was able to find a new jacket at Eddie Bauer.  Pip graciously mailed my jacket back home.   Thanks Pip!
We called for a cab and got a ride to the AT about 5 miles east of Lee.  I felt strangely complete, I was now back at the northern most  point I had hiked with John last year, and had completed everything south of me to Georgia.  Everything north of me was new Trail to be discovered, all the way to Maine. 
The trail goes immediately up Becket Mountain, about 800 feet.  It then levels out with small ups and downs as we wind our way to the first shelter, October Mountain Shelter.  The trail in Massachusetts is well cared for, and not nearly as rocky as Connecticut.  In places where it is rocky it is ""littered"" with rocks instead of a ""jumble"" of rocks.  It starts raining with a few miles left and I don my new rain jacket.  We arrive at October Mountain Shelter in a light rain just as its starting to get dark, a campfire is going (our first campfire of the season!) and a Ridge Runner is staying at the shelter for the night.  He introduces himself as SawDog, and he's been a ridge runner for 7 years.  He said he likes to have a campfire going for when hikers get into a shelter.  It's appreciated!  (There haven't been any fires allowed all through NJ - CT)
There's one tent set up behind the shelter and Just Paul came in right behind me, and he decided to sleep in his hammock.  SawDog had set up his one man tent inside the shelter since there was room.  He suggests we set up our tent inside the shelter too so we can sleep in mosquito free comfort.  There is just enough room for the two tents since there is only the three of us in the shelter tonight.  This is great so we won't have to deal with a wet tent in the morning.
It's good to be back in Massachusetts;  all my sections have now been connected, and I'm once again on my way to Maine.","Salisbury, CT
