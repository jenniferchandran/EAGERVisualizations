RC Slowpoke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556630,"Well, Here I set in Florida trying to get in some biking in. I'm not getting ready well enough. It's going to be a rough start come time to hit the trail. I plan on starting at Penn Mari and heading North. This is still the plan. I have many miles under my belt and I know what to expect so I'll just take my time. I'm in no hurry. Over the years I have learned listen to my body. My problem sometimes is listening. But, After tearing up my L/ankle back in 2011 I'm definitely going to listen. I don't want to loose my chance again. Looking forward to the journey. Until then I'll be bikinis more.    If you can't carry know your heart or on your back you probably don't need it. Unknown author.","

RC Slowpoke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554290,"Today I was successful in making a post on the Appalachian Trail Journal. For many years I have followed many Thru-Hikers through their journal posts. This is the year that I hope that you will follow me. I'm a avid hiker. I rather be in the woods enjoying a great hike. 
A few years ago a thru-hiker, Whiitewater, met another thru-hiker who lost his wife to cancer. This gentleman had made a great statement to him. ""If you can't carry it in your heart or on your back you probably don't need it."" I can totally relate to this. I am basically a minimalist. 
I hope to start my hike the first of May in Penn Mar Park near Waynesboro, Pa. and head to Mt. Katahdin. I know, Rocksylvania first. Yep.
I'll be doing some preparation until then.","

RC Slowpoke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556632,"Today I'm am at a campground South of Miami. My wife and I have been here for a few weeks. So far my preparation work has been some biking but for me not enough. I need to do more. For those thru and section hikers who live in Florida know the dilemma. No mountains. Just flat. We were going to Apache Junction, Arizona for a few months to hike and bike but due to my surgery and time we're in Florida. I still plan on starting at Penn Mar regardless of prep work. I am very familiar with hiking as I have been hiking for some 50 years. I have learned to listen to my body, most of the time. I'm not interested in doing big miles anyhow. I know that it will take me more time to get my trail legs under me but that's ok. Looking forward to the journey. If you can't carry in your heart or on your back you probably don't need it.

RC Slowpoke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561113,"Well, I might be a little late getting on the AT. It looks like my wife has to work the last weekend of April and possibly to the second of May. I might be able to make other arrangements. We'll see. We got back from Florida a week ago and I'm busy getting yard work done so when I leave my wife will be able to cope with it. I didn't get much of a workout in Florida as it's flat. All the miles of biking and walking was all flat. I guess that the first few weeks of the trail will be rough. Oh well.","

RC Slowpoke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562224,"I was hoping to get on the AT by May 1st but due to no transportation to get there I will be getting there on May 4th so what will be my start date. My lovely wife, Lorri, had to do a hearing tests job in Sparta, Wisconsin. I had a great friend from church offer to take me but everything worked out as I have two appointments just before going. The best one is for trigger point injection for my right shoulder. I'm excited about that as it will help my right shoulder not to hurt so much. I also have Rock Tape for my left foot to help with a weak tendon from a bad sprain back in 2011 that cost me my thru-hike. Hopefully, No injuries this time.

RC Slowpoke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564306,"Finally managed to get on my journal from my phone.  I left Penn Mari Park on 5/4.  It's been a rough hiking so far for me. I've been sick and chilled the past few days.  I have made it to Boiling Springs, Pa.  I'm going to stay at a hostel tonight with another hiker.  I need to get warm.  Tomorrow is another day.  I might just might stay tomorrow also.  Sorry for not being able to get on until now","Boiling Springs, Pa

RC Slowpoke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565641,"Well, As quickly as it started it has ended.  I managed to get from Penn Mari to Lickdale, Pa..  118 miles.  The reason for coming off was extremely sharp back muscle spasms to the point that I felt it necessary to come off.  Thanks for all of you who have been following me and praying for me. I am not sure of whether or not I'll be getting back on.  Only time will tell.","

RC Slowpoke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578218,"Well, I thought that I might be able to get back on the AT but I won't be. After acknowledging the logistics of getting off four times and back on three times I decided to stay off until next Spring. Next year there's nothing scheduled that would take me off the trail. It was foolish of me to think that I would be able to finish this year with everything that was going on. I hope that everyone has a great holiday season and stay warm this winter. Until next spring. God bless you all.","
