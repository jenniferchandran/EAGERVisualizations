We have done a bit of traveling...well, more than a bit with over 5,000 miles of driving in a month. But, it was so good to be able to spend time with family and friends. Caboose got to spend Thanksgiving with her sister and they enjoyed cooking a holiday dinner together for the first time ever. As I typed that, it sunk in how sad it is that two sisters who love each other so much have spent so little time together. Life gets in the way of really living all too often. I think that's partly why we are so excited to finally be on the verge of starting this amazing journey together.

It was a bit warmer than we're used to this time of year, almost 80 degrees, but under the canopy of oaks it was very nice.The gear is working out very well and the Zpacks packs were SUPER comfy!

Engine & Caboose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554033,"Well, for those who know me, this will come as no surprise. After much discussion and searching for input from various sources, we have decided to move our departure date ahead from March 8th to February 26th. While I'm known for getting antsy before a trip, and usually end up leaving early, this was honestly for different reasons. Over the years since we began dreaming about a thru-hike, the trail has changed fairly dramatically. Back in the 1980's when this grand adventure first became a lifelong goal, there were a few hundred hikers every year. Now, a combination of greater population and increased awareness brought about largely by Hollywood has caused a relative explosion in thru-hiker numbers. Over the past couple weeks, as we looked at the ATC registration charts for 2017, it became apparent we would be looking at starts of over 50 hikers per day on average. Some days would actually be twice that number. Now, yes, I can be a bit unsociable...but for this experience one of my goals was to work on that. We want to share the experience with other hikers, just not to the point where it's hard to find a spot for your tent.So we decided to push it up just 10 days or so, which really moves us ahead of a large portion of the early ""bubble"". The weather isn't that much different from late February to early March anyway. Although Caboose is no huge fan of the cold, she's working on it. Yesterday we took advantage of a cold morning in central Florida and she kept a smile on her face as we left the trail head in 37 degree weather. It was an amazing hike and the gear is finally dialed in. We're ready...and as of this morning, this is the month. 25 days until we launch on the biggest challenge (other than raising four awesome daughters)we'll ever face!",,Big news,"Feb 01, Wed",0

We are both like kids waiting for Christmas...time is flying by, but we're ready to get started. It's been a very busy few weeks getting final details around the house taken care of, as well as visiting with friends and relatives. Caboose has been fighting a bad early allergy season with sky high pollen levels, but in a few days she shouldn't have to deal with that...not much pollen in the mountains this time of year.The final pack shake downs have been completed and with winter gear our base weights are in the 12-14 pound range. Once we send the winter gear home, our base weights should be close to, if not under, 10 pounds each. We've done all we can to get the gear weight down without sacrificing all creature comforts, now we just have to be safe, not get hurt, and stay motivated.Based on the long range forecasts, it's looking like a wetter and warmer than average spring...no rain, no pain, no Maine... :-)",,1 Week To Go,"Feb 18, Sat",0

We stopped at Springer and signed the register, got our photos, and continued on.

Not good for the masses planning to start tomorrow. A nero and a zero are probably good since my knee is not happy with the downhills right now. I've had this issue before, but with rest it gets better. We bought a new MSR Pocket Rocket stove to replace our old alcohol stove which really failed to meet expectations in the cold.

Let me say, the climb out of Addis Gap is on well graded trail, but it goes straight up for about 800'. In my opinion, the hardest climb since Amicalola...We made the gap by 10:15 and proceeded to spend a wonderful 30 minutes basking in the sun. We were actually warm for the first time in days. While waiting a very nice couple, Don and Donna, pulled up and shared some trail magic in form of chocolate covered almonds. It was so tasty! By 11:25 no shuttle showed up so I called the Budget Inn and found out the times listed are for departure from the motel, not arrival at the gap. Just as we were getting ready to enjoy a burger provided by a group of trail angels, the shuttle arrived and we had to head out.

After celebrating with a quick lunch and a few photos, the four of us, with The Captain in tow, started up Trey mountain. That was a climb...Ughhhh. But we enjoyed our day in glorious weather.

After getting to the shelter, we had a great night with new friends though. Ginger Snap and Rash received their trail names, and we decided John Wick should be changed to Early Bird.

On the way we took a moment to celebrate the one-hundred mile mark under the fire tower on Mount Albert. The climb up Albert was a scramble in the rain, but Caboose powered up and we gained the top.Well, word quickly spread of our plans and before you know it, we had 5 tired wet hikers headed into town to share a room.We called and reserved a room at the Budget Inn in Franklin while hiking.

Caboose and I were saddened to see the damage to the tower on Wayah Bald. We had been excited to see the tower again after having enjoyed a morning there with Righteous in the fall of 2013.We moved on to the shelter and enjoyed an evening with friends.

Then we dove into our bags and tried to stay warm for the afternoon. After a couple hours of warm lazy resting, we cooked dinner and enjoyed a hot batch of Spanish rice with bacon bits.

It's a long story, but thankfully it all worked out.Caboose did very well hiking in sometimes treacherous conditions, but she did take a couple hard falls. On one of those she tweaked her knee.

Well, it seamed to take forever. The trail was nothing but up and down, much of it quite steep.Finally, around 10:15 we made it to the Fontana marina and caught a shuttle to the Fontana Lodge with Early Bird, Sitting Bull, and Acorn. The Captain hadn't shown up when the shuttle pulled up and he arrived at the lodge a little bit later. Apparently, he watched us loading into the shuttle from the trail, but couldn't yell loud enough to get our attention.With the terrible weather forecast, a number of hikers were at the lodge with plans to wait out the winter storm. Snow and arctic cold temps were forecast for higher elevations in the Smokies until Thursday. The wind chill was expected to be -14* at times. We ran into Beaker, Rooster, and Hydrator in the lobby, and it turned out Ginger Snap was in the room next door as well.Since Caboose is not a fan of the cold, we decided to take a couple zeros at the lodge. The rest of our party did as well, with the exception of Acorn. Even though we all tried to convince him to stay, he moved on to the Fontana Hilton, with plans to head up into the Smokies on Tuesday. We're all very worried about him. His gear is woefully inadequate for the forecast conditions.Dinner was great fun and we all unwound a bit. I'm guessing some of our gang will wake up with a bit of a headache.Now to wait out the weather...

Since everyone at the shelter spent the previous day hiking in ice water all day, we went to bed with wet shoes, socks, and pants.This morning we collectively awoke to shoes frozen so hard they were essentially shoe shaped blocks of ice. At that point, most of us decided to go to Gatlinburg and thaw out. After prying on our shoes for 30 minutes, Caboose and I managed to get them on our feet, but we couldn't tie the frozen laces. Since the water and slush had turned into a sheet of ice, we strapped our microspikes on over our ""ice shoes"" and headed for the gap.Two hours later we were thumbing a ride and we're picked up by a very nice German businessman.

This really seemed to help and we made great time all morning.After an hour we removed the microspikes, hopeful that it would be for good. It seemed like the ice had finally all melted.

If you consider the fact that there are a couple significant climbs during the descent, the total elevation loss is over 6,000'.

On the descent from Snowbird, she was reduced to a 1 mph hobble. We stopped at Low Gap and ate while a group of caring hikers had an ""intervention"" with my loving, but very stubborn wife. Eventually, after some emotional moments, she relented. I contacted the shuttle driver from Standing Bear and arranged for him to pick us up at the next gap.

She was feeling better by morning and seemed to be eating without discomfort. Her excessive weight loss has been a serious concern. On top of that, her ulcer acted up a few days prior to Pearisburg, and she got nauseous every time she ate. In addition to having her eat more, we managed to get 10 bottles of Boost into her while waiting out the weather. Today, she drank the last 2 bottles and ate something every hour while hiking. We're really hoping this approach solves the issue.The hiking today was relatively easy for the most part. There were only a couple stretches of rocky trail, and very few steep climbs.We had hoped to use the ""zip line"" to the Captain's, but the river was raging still and he had it closed. Instead, we pitched our tent about 20 feet above the raging river and settled in for a nice evening with Jam camped next to us.Unfortunately, Molasses was unable to join us today.

After cresting the top, a 3 mile long Boulder field was next on the list. We were exhausted by noon, and finally stopped for lunch at War Spur Shelter around 12:30. We ate a couple of wraps, and dried our feet in the sun, then we headed out. The climb immediately after leaving the shelter seemed endless, mostly due to the temperature and full sun.About 1/2 mile before the top we spotted Kentucky Straight laying beside the road. He looked pretty well worn out.

Constant views, some rock scrambling, and about a mile of huge old cairns thought to have been left by early settlers.The descent from the ridge was steep and Molasses mentioned his ankle had started to hurt again.

In addition, there were some fairly hairy river crossings, one of which had Caboose in the fast moving river up to her caboose. 
We spent the better part of the day hiking in a small river anyway, since the trail had turned into a tributary of the larger streams. It seems like the local trail maintainers don't know about water dams...

It was especially difficult given that we had sent all of our cold-weather gear home in Pearisburg.
For most of the day when we weren't hiking in very rocky terrain we were hiking in what amounted to a creek since the trail was filled with three inches of flowing water after all of the rain. Our feet were wet and our attitudes were fairly sour to match.
After all of that, as we finally got down to the Tye River, we heard someone holler at us as we crossed the bridge. When I looked back, there was Stix walking out of the woods. We hadn't seen him in weeks and thought that he was so far ahead we would probably never see him again.
He told us that Hobo would be getting off the trail the next day due to an unexpected employment opportunity. Furthermore, he explained that they had beer and would be getting some food later. That was all it took to convince us to stay.

The hike took us along the C&O Canal towpath for a while and then we turned and headed up away from the river.
As the morning went on, it became more and more apparent that something was bothering Molasses. Eventually, I stopped and asked him if everything was okay and at that point he stated that he knew his hike was over. His leg had been bothering him badly all morning and he had reached the point where hiking was just no longer any fun.
We hiked about a mile and a half up to a road crossing near a small State Park where he made arrangements to get picked up in Harpers Ferry by Rachel. It was a very emotional few minutes but eventually we had to say our goodbyes. We hiked on, while Molasses made his way out to the road to hitch a ride back to Harpers Ferry.
The rest of the afternoon was spent in quiet contemplation thinking about our friend who had left the trail after so many hundreds of miles together.
Eventually we reached the Dahlgren Backpack Campground where we quickly pitched the tent in preparation for the coming thunder storms that removing are away. We cooked a quick dinner ate and dove in the tent just as the storms arrived.
The thunderstorm very quickly put me to sleep and we spent most of the next 12 hours in the tent, hiding from the weather.","Harper's Ferry

We hiked for most of the day in deep mud and over seemingly endless wet boulder fields. As a result of hiking with wet socks all day, we both ended up with very sore feet. The tops of the middle three toes on my right foot were very swollen and abraded. I'm hoping it'll be better when the shoes dry out.
It was a day for amazing Trail magic though. At one of the road crossings, a very nice trail angel had just set up and provided us with chicken salad sandwiches, soda, and some energy bars. Manna from heaven after the first 17 hard miles.
Later, after we finally managed to navigate through what felt like miles of boulder fields, we finally made it to Penn Mar State Park. We were met at the park by Omar and his wonderful wife who drove us over an hour to our friend Katie's house in Hanover.
This is just another example of how the trail provides when needed. We had never met Omar or his wife, yet they'd gladly drove 2 hours round-trip to drop us off at a friend's house who wanted to let us visit and enjoy the comforts of civilization for a night.
After we got cleaned up and settled in, we ate and relaxed. Katie arrived home from work a few hours later, and we all enjoyed hanging out and sharing stories.

Today the trail was better than it had been in Maryland. We hiked all morning in intermittent rain and a few boulder fields. The rain really started getting to Caboose by early afternoon. We got to Caledonia State Park and she was ready to be done. I checked on the possibility of camping in the park, but between having a 1/2 mile walk and the $29 fee for a tent site, I made other plans.
We went to the snack bar and ate cheeseburgers with fries, while I arranged for a shuttle to the Scottish Inn in Fayetteville, PA.

Within an hour the sun started to peek through the clouds and immediately we both felt our spirits being lifted. All day long the trail was nice and we made great time. 
We passed the actual half-way point a little before lunch time. Caboose and I were both shocked to realize we were now closer to Katahdin than Springer. It's hard to believe this hike will be over in less than three months. 
Eventually we reached Pine Grove Furnace state park where we found Hummingbird on the deck of the general store. He was recovering from an attempt at the half gallon challenge. It's tradition for thru hikers to try to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting. 
Neither Caboose nor I had any desire to try it, but we did enjoy a delicious quesadilla, fries, and some orange sherbet. 
I paid for a tent site and we made the long walk to the campground. If we had known it was so far back, we would have grabbed a couple of bunks at the hostel instead. But the campground was nice and even though it was memorial day, it was nearly empty since most people have to work tomorrow.

Our feet are starting to look and smell like they belong in the morgue. Even the local residents are complaining about the rain...
Thankfully, a bit of trail magic in the form of sodas and snacks parked me up. Many thanks to Pickle who hiked the trail in 2016 for the perfectly timed treat!

After we were dropped back off at the ATC office in Boiling Springs, it was only two and a half hours over the muddy trail to get into Carlisle. The hiking through farmland was a unique experience. We were in town and  checked into the Days Inn before 11 am.
By early afternoon we had done our laundry and eaten lunch. After that it was so nice to have an easy day spent relaxing.
We aired out and dried all our gear after the many days of rain. Then we went to dinner and finished our gorging for the day.

We finished crossing the Cumberland Valley by passing through many farm fields. At one point we passed within about 10 feet from a small group of cows who looked at us like we had invaded their territory. We both got a big laugh out of that.
Eventually, the trail begin to climb and we worked our way back up into the mountains again. After cresting the mountain near a pipeline view point, the trail was  reported to be very rocky for the next 6 miles. Neither one of us found that to be the case however. While there were certainly rocks, at no time were they bad enough that we felt hindered in our progress.
Caboose did manage at one point to take a bad fall, hitting her head on a rock. Thankfully, it turned out to be minor but it could have been so much worse. Hopefully Pennsylvania has nothing more in the way of falls to offer us during our passage through the rest of the state.
We made it into Duncannon by 1:30 in the afternoon. Just as we were walking into town A van pulled up next to us and we saw Viido in the passenger seat as she was catching a shuttle for resupply at the grocery store.
We jumped in the van and got her resupplied done early before we got to the Doyle hotel and checked in.
For those who aren't aware, The Doyle is something of a landmark on the Appalachian Trail. Hikers have been staying here for many years and while it has the reputation of being a dive, apparently that doesn't deter too many people.The room we ended up in was referred to as the honeymoon suite by one of the owners. This is somewhat humorous as at $35 it is probably grossly overpriced. However, in keeping with trail tradition, we did stay.
After grabbing dinner at the pub down the street, we shared another cold beer in the bar at the Doyle, then headed upstairs to the room.Hopefully the train that we have been hearing go by about every 15 minutes doesn't keep us awake the entire night.","Carlisle, PA

Walking out of town was interesting. Duncannon has a lot of traffic, but isn't really a large town. We dodged traffic for about 45 minutes until we got across the Susquehanna River. We did experience a humorous bird attack. There were a pair of falcons on the light poles as we were crossing the river. Apparently, hikers are on their list of unwelcome visitors. We were informed in no uncertain terms that our presence was not acceptable.
Once we were back in the woods and had climbed the boulders up to the ridge, the hiking was decent. We took our time today and made no attempt to go fast. It was nice to move at a relaxed pace for a change.
After enjoying an early lunch at Table Rock with Veto and Hummingbird, we headed out. I dropped down nearly 400' to get water from a spring at the next shelter, which required going down and up 300 stone steps.
The weather was glorious all day, but by early afternoon we were both ready for a break and we got one in the form of ice cream sandwiches from a trail magic provider.
Finally, around 3:30 pm, we found a nice tent spot and decided to call it a day. We set up the tent, cooked dinner, and called it a day early. Hopefully we sleep better tonight than we did at the Doyle.

We were finally packed up and got moving a little before 8 o'clock. During the morning hours the trail was great and the miles flew by. We got to Rausch Gap shelter, dropping down to the river for water around 10:30.
At that point the hiking became harder due to many short steep climbs and much rockier trail. We stopped around 12:30 for some trail magic and a short lunch break.
The Gatorades provided by Melamie, the trail angel, we're just exactly what we needed on a warm afternoon.
It took another four hours of dancing through boulder fields to reach the 501 shelter. It's one of the few fully enclosed shelters on the trail. The shelter even has a large skylite in the middle.
Since by this point in the hike we have learned that good sleep rarely happens in a shelter, we pitched our tent a little bit down the trail.
After a tasty dinner, and getting cleaned up, we hit the tent for the evening. We are hoping to make it a little over 24 miles to Port Clinton tomorrow. Since the forecast is for rain tomorrow afternoon it would be nice if we could be in a motel room.

I eventually got moving and went to Walmart for resupply. When I got back Caboose was up and we went about the tedious task of taking all the food out of the original packaging and putting it in ziplocs.
After breakfast, we caught a ride back to the trail. Due to a late start combined with very sore feet and tired legs, we decided a short day was in order. Thankfully, the trail was decent with only a few boulder fields.

Within a couple of hours Caboose had taken a bad spill but was thankfully relatively uninjured. Other than a nasty bump on the knee and a bruise to her hand she got through that one as unscathed as you could hope for.
Since she was freezing in the cold rain and had already fallen once on the wet rocks we decided to call it a day when we reached the Allentown Hiking Club shelter.
At that point we had covered only 7.4 miles, but it was worth it to be dry warm and out of the rain inside the shelter. It was only 9:45 a.m. And we had many visitors stop in throughout the day who all admitted they were jealous of our decision when they saw how comfortable we looked.
We enjoyed a tasty lunch, took part in a game of checkers, and just generally relaxed.
By dinnertime a few more hikers had shown up to spend the night, but there were only five of us in the shelter as well as one hiker who tented nearby.

I guess we are finally in northern Pennsylvania and this is about as good as it gets. We crossed the knife edge which was fun, and we were both glad we had done it today instead of yesterday in the rain.
For most of the day we had the trail to ourselves, seeing very few other hikers. Eventually we reached the Lehigh Valley area. From that point we were going to try to arrange a shuttle into the hostel in Palmerton. However, the hostel provider was short-staffed and declined to provide a ride, leaving us with little option but to seek shelter elsewhere.

There were some scary sections in the rocks but they were amazing views as well.
Once we had cleared the open Rocky stretch and made the Ridgeline, the trail for the next mile or two was amazingly nice. Unfortunately, that didn't last long and the rest of the day was spent negotiating some of the worst rocks we had seen in Pennsylvania.
As a result, this turned out to be probably mentally my worst day on the trail in a long time. I was just fed up with the constant struggle of trying to take a step without turning an ankle.
By the time late afternoon had rolled around we decided a motel would be in order again, to reward ourselves for the difficult day.
We got to the road crossing into Wind Gap and walked into town. We ended up getting a room with Monkey at the Travel Inn, which turned out to be probably the worst motel on trail so far! I strongly recommend avoiding this location...

Almost from the time we hit the woods until we got to camp we saw wildlife all day. Many different snakes, multiple deer, and a few rabbits.

Whether it was truly a sign or not made little difference. The day was very difficult given the extreme heat and dozens of steep climbs.
To top it all off, our water filter died. It would pump but it took 10 minutes just to get a little over a liter of water. By the time we got to the shelter we were extremely thirsty and very tired. When I got down to the water source which was supposed to be a spring but turned out to be a shallow puddle which seemed to be a breeding ground for mosquitoes, it was too much to take.

Mostly, due to my stupidity.We arrived in Dalton just a few miles after breaking camp in the morning. While walking through town, a very nice couple offered to provide us a ride to the Walmart for resupply which we gratefully accepted. Once that task was completed, we headed to the post office where many of us had business to take care of.Unfortunately, some of the packages that we were waiting on had not arrived, or at least we were told they hadn't arrived yet. Sarge had important mail coming from home that wasn't there even though his wife had paid for overnight shipping. It seemed the same thing had happened to Caboose and I with a package coming from Amber, our Logistics officer par excellence.After a few minutes of confusion that issue was straightened out and we found our package which happened to contain a badly-needed water filter. The bigger issue, caused by me, was that my replacement phone had arrived and when I sent the old phone back to Verizon I forgot to remove the SIM card.This caused me to have to take a bus to a neighboring town to go to a Verizon store and have a new SIM card created. Thankfully my wonderful friends, including Popcorn, Sarge, and Monkey, actually waited for me.Once back with the group, we hiked the remaining few miles to the campsite and enjoyed a relaxing evening before bed. It was a long day but at least we got the important things done that we needed to.","Kay Wood Shelter

We knew that we would be reaching Vermont which had always seemed like a huge milestone in the hike. In my mind, Vermont had always felt like the gateway to the true north as the AT continues on.Knowing that we had a relatively long day with some more significant climbs than we had seen recently, we got an early start.After just over 7 miles we finally hit the sign indicating we were crossing into Vermont and had joined the Long Trail, which coincides with the Appalachian Trail for the first 105 miles into the state.Almost immediately, we realized why hikers sometimes refer to Vermont as ""Vermud"". For the remainder of the day we spent about 75% of our time hiking in or around deep dark mud. By the time we reached the shelter it was raining steadily, we were all relatively exhausted, and ready to stop hiking. The shelter itself was an Antiquated structure that had probably outlived its useful life span. Caboose, popcorn, and I decided to stay in the shelter. Sarge, not being a big fan of shelters and probably having better judgment than I, decided to pitch his tent. Later in the evening I would regret not having done the same as sleep was very difficult in the small shelter that had become overcrowded by dark.","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

After 30 minutes of answering questions about hiking the AT, we headed downhill to the pond.
Once at the lake, we hiked about 20 minutes around the shoreline to the camping area. It was disappointing to see the normal tent sites on the shore were closed due to flooding. Instead, we had to camp up into the woods without much of a view. But, Popcorn and Monkey both enjoyed a swim and I had a humorous experience.

If there was any complaints today it would only be related to a very annoying swarms of black flies that would descend upon us occasionally as we stopped. Apparently, due to all of the rain that this area has seen through May and June the black flies are here much later than they would normally be.

Caboose and I joked with Sarge and Popcorn throughout the day and during the times that Monkey was patient enough to hike with us old folks, it was good to spend time with him as well.
By afternoon things had warmed up and we were beginning to experience some nice views as well. At one point in the day we began to see a lot of moose droppings as well as tracks. The woods were very thick in that area and expectations of a moose sighting were high. About 30 minutes after entering that section of forest I spied something moving through the trees ahead of us and we began to follow it through the forest hoping for another siding. It ended up being a fellow backpacker and the joke was on me for tracking the ""Moose"" through the forest for nearly an hour.
We arrived at the pond in the late afternoon, and found a tent pad large enough to fit Popcorn's tent as well as our tent on. Pitching are non freestanding tents on a platform takes a little work but we have figured out a system and it's nice to know that we'll be able to do it when that's all that's available further north.

There were a few climbs that began to remind us that we were getting back into real mountains again. But, we just geared down and took our time getting over them while we regain our climbing legs.
We enjoyed a nice lunch while covering ourselves in Deet. Between the mosquitoes and the black flies this wet season in Vermont has us wondering how things will be when we get to Maine.
The camping area near the shelter as we arrived was better than we had hoped. There were room for mini tents and we pitched under a Grove of Pines on a bed of soft pine needles.

Engine & Caboose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571396,"Last night before we went to bed we discussed the need to get an early start since we had to climb up and over Killington Peak and we wanted to get into town at a reasonable time. The consensus was that we would leave at 5:30, but as seems to be the rule we were about 15 minutes late getting out of camp.
The day started with a steep thousand foot climb and we just took our time while the world woke up around us. We saw a beautiful sunrise and listen to the forest start another day. It was humbling for all of us.
It seems like almost daily one of us will pipe in and mention how excited we are to be hiking the Appalachian Trail. To still have that level of excitement when we are now less than 500 miles from our destination is such a gift.
Eventually we reached the base of Killington Peak and we took a quick break before the climb. The climb itself lasted a little over two hours with the last hour spent in a cold rain. Just before reaching the shelter that sits under the peak Caboose slipped and badly Twisted her knee. It was a very scary moment, but thankfully the injury did not turn out to be serious and she was able to limp on to the shelter.
Since they climb off Trail up to the peak is very Steep and rugged Sergeant I went while popcorn stayed at the shelter with caboose. The rumor was that we could get cold sodas and hot sandwiches at the ski resort Lodge up top. What we didn't know, was that the .2 mile climb actually gained nearly 500 ft in that short distance. It was by far the steepest climb we've done to date. By the time Sarge and I got up and over the top, stopped to take in some of the most amazing views we've had on trail, and got to the lodge, it was nearly 30 minutes later.
We quickly grabbed four sodas, four bags of chips, and a sandwich wrap for Caboose. The trip back down on steep wet trail with one hand full of food was an interesting Journey. But, eventually we made it back to the shelter and we all enjoyed a quick meal together before finishing The Descent to get into Rutland. We had checked earlier about a rumored bus that would pick us up and take us into town eight and a half miles from the trail. We got to the road and hiked up to Pico Ski Resort which is part of Killington. We had been told we could just wait out front and the bus would pick us up at 20 minutes after the hour. The timing couldn't have been more perfect since the thunderstorm arrived at 19 minutes after the hour and we dovin the door of the bus as it started raining.

After what seemed like a much longer day than it probably actually was, we arrived at the shelter found some decent spots to pitch our tents.
Unfortunately, the only good spot for Caboose and I was fairly close to the shelter. On a normal day this would not have been an issue. But, this was not a normal day on the Appalachian Trail. We are starting to see the front edge of the Sobo hikers and we are in something of a Nobo bubble. The end result was something like 30 hikers in and around this shelter.

Caboose and I, along with Popcorn, Sarge, and Monkey, enjoyed a hearty lunch as we sat on top of a mountain that provided 360° mist shrouded views of the mountains nearby.
Late in the afternoon as we neared our destination, we had a very scary experience. We were faced with a very narrow eroded Trail and a steep drop off to our right. At the same time we had to climb over a large slick  rock with little or nothing in the way of handholds. I was behind Popcorn as he got to the obstacle and warned him about the penalty for failure which was going to be a nasty 30-foot fall. Somehow, all five of us made it over the obstacle without falling. But, just as Sarge cleared the rock, another hiker behind us started over and slipped. I think all of our hearts stopped as we spun around and watched him fall down the side of the mountain. After flipping and tumbling for over 30 ft he finally came to rest against a tree. I hollered to him and he said that he didn't feel as though anything was broken. It It turned out that he was relatively uninjured other than some major scrapes. After he got back up to the trail, we moved on while I thought about how lucky he was and and how quickly the trail can take away Katahdin.
A little while later we arrived at the Blue Barn which is a wonderful Trail Angels home who provides ten spaces and many goodies for hikers. We set up our tents and then Popcorn, Sarge, and I went and jumped off the nearby bridge into the river which was both thrilling and refreshing.

We caught up around lunch time and finished the day together enjoying each other's company on another beautiful day of hiking. Southern Maine has been hard but knowing that we are on the home stretch seems to continue to push us all through.
It was a fantastic day!","Andover

Engine & Caboose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574102,"Given that we have committed to a finish date of August 18th and time is inevitably marching by, we decided to put in a longer day. The trail was probably more difficult than we had originally realized and by the end of 17 miles we were all fairly exhausted.
Some of that exhaustion stemmed from a lack of water at one of the shelters and all of us were dehydrated by the time we got to camp.
Even though there was a beautiful swimming spot with a Sandy pond I told Caboose I just wanted to pitch the tent get dinner cooked and go to bed. Since she isn't much of a swimmer, there was no argument from her. By the time Sarge, fudge, and popcorn had all rolled in we were thinking about sleep.
We are particularly concerned about popcorn as he looked extremely fatigued and just wasn't himself when he came in around 6:30 p.m.
Hopefully tomorrow he feels better.","South Arm Rd. stealth campsite

Engine & Caboose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574106,"This morning was a very difficult morning since when it was time to get up and Hike popcorn remained in his tent. He just didn't have the energy or the mental desire to go on at this point as he was feeling very poorly.
We all told him we would see him later in the day and hide on over beautiful easy trail for the 9.4 miles down to the road to get a ride into Rangeley.
Once in town we went ahead and grabbed something to eat, and then took care of our resupply. Once we got to the local supermarket I ran in to use the bathroom prior to purchasing supplies. You can imagine my surprise when I looked down and noted a significant amount of blood in my urine. Certainly this is not normal and not to be expected on a thru-hike. But, it's not uncommon among the ultra marathon runners and even marathoners to occasionally have the condition known as hematuria. I decided to go ahead and tell Caboose since I knew she would be upset if I didn't. I just made it a point to hydrate especially well the rest of the day and the condition went away within a few hours. Hopefully it is nothing serious!
Our original intent was to hike on after taking care of business, but we found an amazing room at the Farmhouse Inn with 3 beds, a private bath, and a kitchenette. We all agreed that Popcorn would like the comfort of a room and a short day.
Unfortunately, by dinner time he hadn't shown up and we heard from Monkey that Popcorn was still in his tent when Monkey left camp hours after we did.
Concern was evident and none of us were very cheerful for much of the afternoon and evening. We are praying he's feeling better, but since he doesn't have cell service we cannot contact him.

We got over Saddleback in beautiful weather and the views are nothing short of miraculous. We all had tired legs but we made it to a Logging Road which was a perfect place to camp just as the sky began to rumble and it looked like we were going to get a bad thunderstorm.
We pitched our tents in a beautiful spot near a gorgeous small waterfall and set up camp.
While getting things together I had just enough of a cell phone signal that I was able to get a text message from popcorn. It was not good news. He informed me that he was feeling very poorly and asked us all to hike on without him since he felt at that time that he would probably be ending his hike early.
When I shared this news with Pudge and Sarge it created a very somber time. We know it's possible since people do stop their hike close to the end but the see someone as dedicated as Popcorn thinking about doing that very thing broke our hearts.

The highs have been approaching ad with high humidity and that's very rare this far north. Even given the great sleep I just did not want to get up this morning. My energy levels have been very low and I haven't been feeling myself, especially since the health-related issue in Rangeley.
We did get up and get moving at a decent time however and I was rewarded shortly thereafter by an amazing experience. Well hiking at the head of the line and enormous moose broke out of the brush and ran across the trail in front of me as it went up the mountain.
Unfortunately, Caboose who has been wanting to see a moose so badly was too far back in line to Spot It. Hopefully she'll get another chance for their North.
This was another day of very difficult hiking as we went up in over South and North Crocker Mountain as well as an earlier climb almost to the summit of Sugarloaf which is the second tallest mountain in Maine. The trail has been difficult most of the day and we were all very tired by the time we reached the stealth campsite by a spring under the summit of North Crocker.
The tent sites were fairly terrible with very little level ground and we pitched our tent in what amounted to a bowl filled with roots. But with the oncoming thunderstorm we were glad to have it and approximately 15 minutes after getting the tent pitched we were inside while the rain came down for an hour. We've been very lucky with respect to getting out of the weather the last few weeks.
After it stopped raining, we cooked dinner and filtered water before heading to bed. For the past few nights I've been getting dizzy when I lay down and tonight was no different. Hopefully this passes soon! We're so close...","Sluice Brook Logging Road stealth campsite

In addition to being dizzy, I felt somewhat nauseated as soon as I lay down in the tent last night. I have also had a deep level of fatigue that is becoming worse and worse. On the way down to the road this morning the wind picked up and it felt like rain coming from the trees which caused me to basically snap. I had reached the end of my rope dealing with crappy weather and rough trail so I decided to call it a day in Stratton and recharge my mental batteries.
This was a difficult decision to make as I know it affected the entire group, including Caboose, who seemed to be just fine to go on but as always my loving wife supported my decision to take a day off trail and get a few things done including just rest and relax.
After eating breakfast together we went into town where Caboose and I got a room that included a single bed so Sarge would have a place to stay as well. Pudge decided to go ahead and hike out, which we completely understand on a beautiful day like today having hiked only just over four miles.
Hopefully tomorrow I will have more desire to continue hiking.
I took a quick shower and I went to get our laundry done and just spend some quiet time by myself to get my head straight.

Caboose, Sarge, and I were all a little nervous since we did not know what to expect in the Bigelow's. It turned out that even though the weather was very windy with low visibility up high, we had a good hike.
There were some exposed ridgelines and Peaks but at no time was it slippery and I think we all actually enjoyed the experience throughout the day. It's unfortunate there were no views as we'd been told you could see both Mount Washington and Katahdin from the top of Avery Peak.

Knowing that many hikers behind us would be arriving at the river we decided to get down there so that we didn't have to wait for too many Ferry trips. Since the ferryman can only take two hikers at a time and we had heard rumors of up to 20 or 30 hikers waiting recently, we decided to beat everyone to the punch and got down to the river around 7:30.
By 9:15 we were across the river where we ran into Mr. Bean, a thru-hiker sponsored by LL Bean around 20 years ago. He's a very nice guy who we've had the pleasure of meeting along the trail a few times.
Caboose and I were thrilled to see Jam standing in front of the hostel as we walked up and we greeted one another with a large hug. We had not seen him in close to two months and it felt good to be reunited as he had come north from New Hampshire so he could finish the hike with us.
Along with Sarge, we resupplied quickly at the hostel just up from the river crossing and we were back on trail with Pudge, Jam, and Honey Sticks along with us by 10:15.
Since they were not as many big climbs as there have been in recent days we made good time along the nice trail. We were in camp a little after 5 p.m. input arrived about 45 minutes later.

It's strange how after this many miles, in many ways we feel a little weaker now than we did a thousand miles back. It's almost like we spent the first half of the trip getting stronger and then the second half of the trip trying not to wear out.

I tried to convince her to take a rest day, but being the tough woman she is, she decided to hike out this morning.
We hit the trail by 8:45 and hiked into the 100 mile wilderness. It seems like the end is almost in site, but we're still overcoming obstacles. The trail was not too bad today. There were many ups and downs with a lot of roots, but it was nothing we're not used to in Maine by this point.

Initially it looked like the sun might come out, but that was short lived. About an hour after starting it began to rain. Thankfully it only lasted about 90 minutes and the weather started to clear up.
Around 11 o'clock we hit an old logging road with a sign for trail magic just down the road. A few minutes later we walked up to the cabin owned by Scout, where we were treated to burgers, hot dogs, coffee, soda, beer, and a Bloody Mary.
Scout was featured in Backpacker magazine recently for his trail magic, and rightly so! It is truly an oasis in the wilderness.
After enjoying his hospitality for an hour, we hiked on. The climb up Barren Mountain was slow, but not particularly hard by Maine standards. After the climb we arrived at Cloud Pond lean-to and set up camp. Since storms were supposed to be forecast for the afternoon, we cooked dinner quickly in case it rained.
Good thing we did, because a thunderstorm rolled in around 6 o'clock. We dove into our tents, wondering where Pudge, Monkey, Jam, and the rest of the gang ended up. They all knew we planned to stay here, but hadn't shown up by bed time...

We hiked in a cold shower until the base of White Cap when the sun came back out. By the time we came over the summit the clouds were starting to clear. We weren't certain, but we think we saw the base of Katahdin in the distance. The top was hidden by clouds...
It is starting to hit home that this adventure is nearly over. Physically, Caboose and I are both ready for a break. But mentally, the thought of waking up in six days and not hiking seems very bittersweet.

I will give Jam a free pass on this since he's been the target of all the mosquitoes the last few days. Every time he leaves his tent he's being eaten alive while the rest of us only get a few bites. I feel bad for him, but at the same time it's nice to have someone else who attracts them worse than I do for a change.

It was a day filled with laughter, crying, and long periods of silence as we all contemplated what this actually meant for each of us. It's strange, but sometimes it's difficult to really understand what this long difficult Adventure has done for us. I know that I've changed and I hope it's in a better way, but I'm sure many of those changes will not become apparent for some time yet. It's the same with caboose although I can say I have watched her self-confidence grow by Leaps and Bounds over the last five and a half months. It's been an amazing transformation to watch and it's just one of the many benefits of having committed to this together.
The trail as soon as we entered Baxter State Park was some of the best trail we've seen in weeks and the day went by all together too fast.

Caboose awoke feeling ill with a low grade fever and a productive cough. I know her, and I know that this would not stop her from summiting, but I prayed it wouldn't detract from the quality of her experience too much.
Our group headed for the summit and we passed by the beginning of the Hunt Trail at 6:42 in the morning. For the first hour we quickly climbed through the trees and we hit treeline around 8 a.m.
There was some joking and everyone seemed to be in good spirits, including Caboose, who seem to feel better as the morning went on. Shortly after reaching the tree line, we entered a steep boulder climb which lasted a little over one mile and probably took an hour due to the difficult nature of the trail in that location.
This stretch of the trail was actually quite fun and while I've read accounts of people becoming nervous and quitting at that point none of us saw anything that would cause us to turn around.
Emotions began to run high as we crested the end of the Boulder Field and began to Traverse across a flatter area known as the tablelands. We could see the Peak from here but the sign was not yet visible and wouldn't be for another 45 minutes.
By this point it had become very quiet and are relatively large group as the enormity of what we were about to accomplish head started to sink in. A little before 10 a.m. We crested the final steeper pitch and there was the Katahdin sign about 200 ft in front of us.
Almost simultaneously Caboose and I saw the sign and the emotions began to well up. I heard Sarge exclaim ""Oh hell"" behind me. The rest of the group began to quietly sob as well.
As Caboose and I reach the sign we were no longer able to speak since we were both crying uncontrollably. We touched the sign marking the northern terminus of our journey at the same time while crying ""It's over"".
It was a moment that none of us will ever forget! This journey of thousands of miles and millions of footsteps was over with just one foot step and resting her hands on a monument that has come to signify so much to so many people.
Caboose and I have made lifelong friends and we have experienced things that couldn't have been experienced in any other way. Neither of us would change one thing about this experience and it was a blessing to be able to participate in this annual pilgrimage.
I intend to fill in some blanks in the coming weeks with respect to gear, and other Trail related Lessons Learned.

",Baxter Peak on Katahdin,"Aug 18, Fri",5.20
Engine & Caboose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576443,"After unwinding for nearly two weeks, I wanted to take some time to share a few of the lessons we learned on our journey. Best Practices:1. Don't start out too fast. Don't start out too fast. Don't start out too fast!!! Almost without exception, the people who quit the trail in the first few weeks all pointed at injuries brought on by trying to hike too many miles before their bodies were sufficiently trail tough. What's the correct amount? It's a very individual thing, but I recommend 8-10 miles a day for the first two weeks and then building on that. Your cardio vascular system and muscles might be ready from day one for 20 mile days, but your connective tissues won't be ready...only time on trail can prepare them.2. Keep your pack weight down. It seems obvious, but you wouldn't believe the things people were carrying early on. A pack weighing more than 35 pounds with 5 days of food and 2 liters of water is totally unnecessary and counterproductive to enjoying your hike. Remember, this is a thru-hike, not a backpacking trip. The vast majority of your time while not sleeping or eating will be spent walking. All of the extra items you think you need for comfort in camp will see little or no use. In fact, you should aim for a pack weight below 30 pounds at all times. 3. You'll bring too much food at first, so keep this in mind when planning your initial meals. For the first week or so, your body will be so busy hiking and repairing itself, it will not channel much energy into digestion. After a few weeks this will change and eventually you'll want to eat everything in sight. Until then, don't worry about the lack of hunger. Just realize your shorts are going to get a little loose...4. Hike your own hike! Don't allow your pace or destination choices to be dictated by fellow hikers. If you want to stop for the day, stop. If you want to hike long, hike long. Think you need a zero? Then you should absolutely take one. Listen to your body...it should be the boss.5. Take your time, especially over the last month. You'll probably only do this once...live it up!Gear which worked and didn't:1. My Zpacks Arc Haul was excellent as long as I kept the weight around 25 pounds or less. Once it got above 30 pounds, I had a hard time staying comfortable. This was especially true once my waist size got pretty small. Caboose started out with the identical model Zpacks Arc Haul and she was never able to get it to fit in a manner she was comfortable with. She was just too small. Zpacks does make a model for smaller people now, so that might work for some. She switched to an Osprey Ace 50 in Damascus and it did the job the rest of the way to Katahdin. 2. We both used Enlightened Equipment Revelation quilts and they were FANTASTIC! I carried a 20 degree quilt and Caboose used a 10 degree. With a Sea to Summit liner, they were all we ever needed from temps in single digits to nights in the low 60s.3. We started out with an alcohol stove and Caldera cone...that lasted 3 days before we switched to an MSP Pocket Rocket 2 canister stove. The alcohol stove never got hot enough in the extreme cold of February, nut the MSR performed flawlessly all the way until the end. We used a 1.3 L titanium pot throughout and it was perfect for the two of us. A typical meal was 2 Knorr rice sides with some chicken or tuna thrown in for protein. Many hikers used other systems which cooked a tad faster, but weighed considerably more...everything is a compromise I guess.4. Our Zpacks Triplex tent was without question our favorite piece of gear! Room for both of us and all of our gear and a total weight well under 2 pounds. NOTHING else available could touch that and we heard time and again how jealous people were of our tent. Expensive? You bet it was. But when you're going to be spending that much time in your tent, it's money well spend. Also, it looks as good now as it did when new, so durability is no problem.5. When our first Sawyer Squeeze filter froze in the Smokies, we switched to the new MSR model which allows for one handed use by squeezing a built in bulb on the filter. The MSR failed completely within weeks. We got another Sawyer and never looked back. They work well and when set up as a gravity filter in combination with an Evernew bladder the Sawyer is a hands free method of obtaining safe drinking water...just don't let it freeze.I'll add more information in the future.",,View Entry,"Aug 29, Tue",0
