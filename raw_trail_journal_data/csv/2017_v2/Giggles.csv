Giggles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477193,"A month ago Wayne and I went to visit our son in Ohio. Since we live in Florida, it gives Wayne a chance to actually climb hills! He found a park (Clear Creek) near our son's that had 8 trails ranging from easy to difficult. After walking one of the easier trails, he decided to attempt a more difficult trail that included rocky terrain and uphill climbing. He was exhausted and realized just how much more training he will need to be ready for 2017. Wayne works full time presently as a maintenance mechanic. He works some very long days and until recently some very odd hours. Presently he works Monday thru Friday in the afternoons. He is hoping that now our weather here in Florida is less humid, he will get good morning walks in. when he first started walking at the end of May, he was averaging 2-5 miles at least 5 days a week. Once the humidity rose the walks happened less frequent. His goal is to get to the 10 mile walks and then start wearing some gear. He has purchased walking poles and says they really make a difference. I keep a journal of the dates he walks, the distance, the place and the time. Good information to look back on and gives him encouragement to go further.Wayne,our grandson and son-in- law decided this morning to go to The Swanee River area to hike. Will discuss their ""bonding"" time in next post.Trail Boss","Pre-Trail

Have not been training as I should because of it. Do watch a lot of the videos online and enjoy all the entries. Hope to make it to Trail Days this year. Still planning to be on the trail in 2017!

Giggles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/488766,"Wayne had MRI and has herniated disk. He will have shot next week for his disk pain. He has also been to the podiatrist for his heel spur. Of course he did not like her suggestion to stay off the foot for several weeks! He will most likely have a shot in his foot in two weeks too. He has returned to walking at least 3 times a week and feels so much better having been able to achieve this accomplishment. He is still working full time until December of 2016 so training time is precious ! Attempting to hike the AT is very important to him and a lifelong dream that we, his family, as well as Wayne truly hope he gets to at least try in 2017. We look forward to our Shenandoah trip in June with daughter, son-in-law and 2 grandkids. Hopefully we will have pictures to post then.Wayne loves reading the journals of those thru hikers on the trail this year. Keep up the good work.","

He did very well for not having been out since the end of April! We put out gear on the dining room table and started our list to have with us when shopping. It is easy to forget over time just what one has purchased!We went to see A Walk in the Woods and unfortunately were disappointed.

Nothing available in Damascus...2 year waiting list on most cabins for Trail Days. we walked around Friday and checked out vendors. The Paka caught Wayne's eye.

Wayne finally got to do some real hiking while here. He went for 12 mile and 8 mile walks and got feel for what's ahead of him next year. I stayed at lodge and enjoyed the scenery, talked to numerous guests and did my Cardmaking craft. Very relaxing and enjoyable trip for me! Very exciting and informational trip for Wayne. We ate at lodge one night but off season (inbetween busy hiker starts in April and the Memorial Day weekend) and food selection very limited. We decided to drive into Dahlonega the day before leaving. Found the best little coffee shop and had awesome sandwiches AND awesome deserts! We actually stopped for muffins and coffee on our way home the next day...making it a super start to our trip home. All in all this adventure was a wonderful idea. Really have feel for how the first 70-100 miles will go. It left me more peaceful as the person staying home and in charge of mail drops, etc.","

Then he is up at 6am to do his 4 hour walk. Wayne impresses me with his desire to reach his goal of hiking The Trail but I am his wife and it is not as encouraging as hearing from strangers! There have been several people lately that have actually stopped their cars and told him how impressed they are with his dedication. They have been watching him increase his length of each walk and seen the reduction in his size! It really is encouraging and spus him on to continue his training. In October we will be in New England celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and he is making plans to hike while there.
