It did not happen. We did have a cold start this morning temp was 21 degrees, but a very sunny day. Did not see any hikers nor did we see any wildlife. Not much from our hike to report. The highlight today was seeing Partnership Shelter. It is one of the nicest shelters we have seen on the trail so far.
We did want to share a couple of things that we have found very useful on our journey so far. We recognize that everyone is different so these tips may not be for all, but here they are:
1. Cleaning eye and sun glasses with Dawn dish soap and water has helped prevent them from fogging up.
2. Hiking poles really work, they have saved us from numerous slips and falls already.
3. Wearing shoes 1 to 1.5 sizes larger than our normal street shoes has boded well in helping prevent bruised toe-nails. This combined with Toe socks for Vagabond and sock liners for Wiesbaden underneath a pair of darn tough socks has kept us from getting blisters. 
Hope some of these will be useful to others. Happy Hiking!!!","Va 670 - South Fork of Holston River

The weather was perfect cool temps, low humidity and the trail was very easy to hike. Yes, we did encounter a couple of rock scrambles but overall this was a great day. We walked on the Old Stagecoach Ttail for several miles - this was originally the Dauphine to Pittsfield Stagecoach line that linked several coal mine towns in the early 1800's. The Shikellimy trail intersects with the AT here - it was named after an Iroquois Chief who aided the early European settlers in this area of Pennsylvania. We met several NOBO thru hikers today, Terminator, Engine and Caboose and we were treated to some trail magic complements of Onisuu, a Hiker Joe who travels up and down the AT in his RV handing out ice cream sandwiches.

The highlight of the day was the gorgeous water falls outside the town of Falls Village - CT. Spent half my time hiking with Roster, a NOBO hiker from PA. He started May 1 in Springer Mountain - GA so he has been really putting in the miles. We gave him a ride into Salisbury so he could do his laundry. Nice young man.

The trail continued to be very rocky with rock faces that went straight up or straight down. The first climb of the day was over 1000 feet up to the Lions Head in just about 3 miles. Then ridge running up and down for another 3 miles before another steep 300 foot climb up Bear Mountain in less than a mile, but the descent of 400 feet in 0.3 mile on the other side was the killer. Wait, this was just the beginning, 700 feet up to Race Mountain and then down 400 feet before climbing up Mt Everett another 700 foot climb then back down 600 feet. Get the picture? A real roller coaster of a day. Then just when I thought I was home free there was a short 100 foot climb up Bushnell Mountain, no sweat, right? Wrong, this little 1800 foot mountain had a descent of 1000 feet straight down on rock slabs that caused me to sit and slide down on my butt several times. Wow, what a day.

Wore low cut trail runner on my left foot which kept my ankle from banging against the high top boot. Wore high top boot on my right foot which helped keep my heel secure and eased the pain. The trail had some climbs but nothing too difficult. The only challenge I had was finding the white blazes. At least three times I found myself searching for the trail. The worst was coming out of the woods after Tully Mountain at the powerline. Took me about 10 mins of searching before I finally found a rock that was covered with weeds that had a white blaze. Very frustrating. There were several highlights today, the trail went through the town of Dalton and some really old historic homes and churches. Later the trail went over the Cobbles, an outcropping of marble rocks that date back 500 million years when it was a seabed.

Today was a special day on the trail as I hiked through the Bear Mountain State Park and crossed the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge. 23 years ago I was stationed at West Point and remember crossing the Hudson on this bridge many times also visiting the park. Little did I know then that I would someday come back and hike this section of the AT. The trail inside the park is made up of over 1000 stone steps all hand placed. On a clear day one can see the NYC skyline from the top Perkins Memorial Tower which is on top of the mountain at 1305 ft. The challenge is the descent down to the Bear Mountain Bridge which goes through a tunnel under US Hwy 9 at 177 feet above sealevel. Much of which goes down rock steps. After crossing the bridge the trail climbs back up the Camp Smith Trail toward Anthony's Nose at 727 feet elevation in about 0.7 miles. Really steep climb but short. The rest of the day's trail was fairly routine with ups and downs and several long sections of rocky trail as well as some nice level sections. I did hike for a mile or so with a NOBO hiker named Traffic from Boston. He and his girlfriend quit their jobs to through hike the AT and are planning to move out to Seattle after they complete their hike. He was a tall long legged fellow who left me in the dust as he was trying to catch up with his girlfriend who was some how ahead of him. Still having difficulty with my left foot seems the tendon that runs on the bottom of my foot had been injured and after a couple of miles into the day it starts throbbing and sending shooting pain through my foot.

I lost 45 minutes overall. Though I could make up the lost time since the trail was so flat but the next section turned into what I call R & R, rocks and roots. Was never able to make up the moist time.

Past several section hikers but no through hikers.  It was sure nice having my trail angel and partner Vagabond waiting for me at Allen Gap with an ice cold gatoraid drink.

Sleeping in a shelter is always a challenge because of the many and varied snoring sounds. I much prefer my tent but the Park restricts camping to designated camp sites which are not very close to the AT. If a shelter is full they allow tent camping near by.

As you might guess it was slow going till sunrise. Unfortunately I was on the west side of the mountain and did not get a good look at the sunrise. I did get a good view of lights from Gatlinburg in the distance. I kept thinking I might run into some nocturnal animals while hiking but never heard or saw any. Took me 3.5 hours to hike the first 5 miles which included a 700 foot climb to Mt.Chapman. After that trail leveled a bit until going over Mt. Guyot over 6000 feet tall. Some place between Tri-Corner Knob shelter and Snake Den Ridge trail I lost my glasses. Pretty sure they fell off while I was climbing up and over a huge down tree that was blocking the trail. I even went back about a mile to that spot looking for them but no luck. Good news was I had a back up pair in my car so I could drive home. Bad news was I had to hike another 13 miles without them. I can see without them but things are blurred and I was really concerned that I might miss a white blaze and go off trail. Luckily that did not happen.

The pictures we took and the places and people we saw and met will never be forgotten.  That's all for now and happy hiking in 2018 !",,Home,"Dec 13, Wed",0
Vagabond and Wiesbaden (VW) Live the Life you have Imagined,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616614,"I started hiking the AT in 2017 with my partner and soul mate Lavonna Skeans, aka Vagabond. After completing about 900 miles together Vagabond had to come off the trail due to a broken tail bone. I continued hiking and finished 2017 with over 1490 miles of the AT completed. In 2018 I resumed hiking sections of the AT that I missed and flip -flopped between Vermont and Georgia. Now I am headed back up north to section hike New Hampshire and the White mountains. Vagabond will be my support person and trail angel. Tonight we are in Allentown PA. Taking two days to drive from home, Elizabethton,TN to New Hampshire.","

Vagabond and Wiesbaden (VW) Live the Life you have Imagined,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616935,It felt good getting back on the trail today. Hiking the last section in VT. Spent most of my time in the woods swatting and running from mosquitoes. Every time I had to stop they would swarm 3&4 at a time bitting my arms and legs. I failed to bring any big spray and paid dearly for my mistake.  Once I got Elm street in Norwich the mosquitoes problem was over.  Spent the last 2 miles walking in town to the Connecticut River bridge.,"Tigertown Road

If I can get this done I will have completed the entire 2189 miles. Started in 2017. Plan to meet my brother in NH and he and will hike together to the ME border. Then I will solo hike to Katahdin.  We will have my wonderful partner, Vagabond, as our support person. She has been supporting me from the beginning and I know without her support I probably would not have gotten as far as I have. I will turn 70 while on the trail next month.",,View Entry,"Jul 13, Mon",0
