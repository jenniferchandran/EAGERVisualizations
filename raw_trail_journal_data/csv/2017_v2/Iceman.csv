Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552558,"Hey, my names Tyler I'm planning to write a journal while hiking the Appalachian trail this year. I wrote one on the PCT in '15 and found it helpful by keeping my friends and family updated, and rewarding in an interesting way.I hiked the AT in '15 and was pretty sure I would never do it again, but I'm a college student and I couldn't take another semester. I'm free in January and thats too early for most other trails in the US.I'll also be with my girlfriend, Ally, and my dog this year! Which changes this hike completely from my last. This journal will be written mostly from my perspective. Despite all of the negative information and feedback about dogs on the long distance trails, I am planning to make it as far as I can with him. This is kind of like an experiment and I do not plan on sending him away. If he cannot continue the hike, I will go home with him. It does not matter how early.In 2015, I focused mainly on gear in my preparation for the AT and this year is a little different. I have mapped out a plan in excel and have tried to keep resupplies and ""town stress"" to a minimum. Before, I planned as I went, and that was great- but this is a different hike.The point of this journal is to keep our families informed on where we are and give them a little information about how we are doing. Most updates will be short, especially during the winter months, and I will put some pictures up when I can. We invite anyone who is interested to follow along on our journey, and feel free to email us with any questions, or to just say hello. Especially if we met on the trail in person! It's always fun to hear from people we've seen before.I will be skipping 71 miles in the Smokies because of the dog restriction. I understand, and have lived within the purist mindset, but you skip larger sections than this because of fires out west. I would love to walk right though, as I have before, but I am not putting Maverick in a kennel for that.We have a ""schedule"" and a pace made up, but we are all ready to decrease or increase if needed.We will be starting early February (1st-5th,) depending on the weather.Maverick will hold a small amount of his food.Over 50% of our resupplies will be food drops, but not all of them.Most of my gear is stuff pulled from the closet this year.I am bummed about the smokies.I'll post a few more updates before the hike. Stoked to get out there.Thank you to anyone who reads this","

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552817,"We are all pretty excited!Ally is cutting back her hours after the 1st so we can do some last minute planning and a few smaller trips.We are planning on mailing all of Mavericks dog food and it's definitely a pain. I've seen a few people post about buying food at stores. I can see how that would make life much easier, but I think i'd rather ship a high quality kibble out and buy him some meat for town stops. He will start with a small ""running"" pack that carries a little over 3 pounds of food and we will carry the rest; because of this, we will be resupplying more frequently.We are still planning on pre-packing out around half of our resupply boxes. The other half will be split between buying food in town, and mailing boxes out in-town. For the in-town resupplies, we are planning on mailing a 15 pound bag of dog food to town and dividing it up into boxes. I'm not sure how well this will work, but i'm thinking that having the extra food will be helpful if we choose to take a zero day, or if Maverick is eating a different amount. It will also save money on shipping because I can send the bag with Prime. We'll see how it goes.We are both from Connecticut and plan on getting a ride down to Springer Mountain.I bought a 2016 AWOL guide for planning, and versus 2015, I've noticed a good amount of the businesses either charge for mail drops, only offer them to guests, or have completely stopped giving the option. I understand why! but I hope that number doesn't decrease even more for 2017. We are already relying on a lot of post offices and they are always tough to hit at the right time. Just a thought.","

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554064,"2/1: car rideWe rented a car and we are on our way down to Gainesville, GA! It feels great to have everything finished up and only our packs in the car.It's a long ride down from CT but we should be there mid day tomorrow and we will get shuttled right to springer mountain. The weather for the weekend has been changing but it looks pretty good. We were hit with some snow in CT yesterday so we pushed the date to today. Sunny and 45 to start the ride out.Our plan is still to take it slow and just see how it goes. It just feels great to be back!We hit a good bit of traffic today but we are going to crash out at a rest area in NC and we will finish the last 5 hours tomorrow.","

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554175,"2/2: car-stover creek shelter 2.8We spent a chunk of the summer driving across country and hiking wicked cool spots along the way and the car never gets much easier. Mavericks use to it but he gets a hot, and for us, all the sitting around in traffic gets old. Everyone is in a hurry.We got up at 2:45 and hurried to get on our way. 5 and a half more hours. Maverick started getting a little restless in the back seat early on.It's really warm out! We were up in Vermont last week and it was so much colder.We cleaned up the car and dropped it off at 1030. We've both never rented a car before and weren't sure how it would go, but we just gave them the keys and left. It was simple.Ron Brown picked us up and gave use a ride up to springer mountain. He's an awesome guy and was extremely helpful by giving us updates on the trail all the way up to the NC border. He also posts them on his FB page.Ron got us up to the springer parking lot around noon and we backtracked one mile to the summit of Springer mountain and then hiked to Stover Creek shelter at mile 2.8.It was so warm today and the sun was poking in and out. I was in a t shirt for a while. We feel a little silly with our micro spikes but it's still February.We finished the day up early and were in around 3. No fires aloud here so we spent the afternoon relaxing and eating some of the car snacks that carried over. Another hiker came into the shelter around 6.Looking forward to a full day on the AT tomorrow","

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554176,"2/3: 15.5 Blackwell creek - 12.7 We got up a little before 6 and got an early start before the sun came out. We made good time and got to hawk mountain shelter around 930. About 5 miles. It was a little cloudy and chilly in the morning but not bad. We met 4 hikers here and 3 were thru hiking. All of them were planning on staying at gooch gap shelter.We left there around 11 and stopped for a lunch break at Cooper gap. About 5 miles later. The sun came out for a bit and the wind picked up. It's not hot or cold but it gets chilly out of the sun when we are sitting and warm when hiking uphill. There's no snow anywhere on the ground.We stopped at Blackwell creek just short of Gooch mountain shelter. It was a little chilly but not bad.Maverick has been doing great so far. We think taking the longer 1 hour breaks during the day have been helpful by giving him some time to rest. He seemed tired when we were getting close to the campsite but was still moderately active in camp. He ate a lot of food. Maverick has been a little overprotective when in camp. He likes to let people know we are here by barking but gives them kisses when they get here. He's a big dog and I feel bad but he'll settle down as time goes on. Ally and I are both doing well and have been happy so far. We've had a lot of down time, especially tonight, we were in our tents at 615.Rain should be coming in the next few days.","2.8 stover creek shelter

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554177,"2/4: 28.2 slaughter creek - 12.7Pretty cold night! The tents were frosty when we woke up and the ground was frozen. Sleeping by the creek wasn't a great idea but the shelter .1 further had people in it.We were all up at 6. None of us slept well but we were still out at 635. First light is around 710 and we were on a ridge for a beautiful sunrise. When we made it to Woody Gap for our morning break we were reminded it was Saturday. The parking lot was full and there were people everywhere. A few dogs were making noise and maverick was getting all wild. We decided to pass up a picnic table in the sun and just dump our trash and move on. For the first time ever I tied maverick to a post right next to us so we could both go through our packs and he broke the leash.The trail north of woody gap was a mad house. We didn't take any breaks because of all the hikers and we were all getting cranky. Eventually, we got a few small snack stops in.Compared to summer months, there is probably hardly anyone out here but we like the less noisy areas.It was cold and windy today. The sun was out but it was just cold. We planned on passing woods hole shelter to avoid people and staying at a tentsite .4 after it. When we got there the spring was buried under leaves and we almost missed it. We got to slaughter creek around 330 and luckily it was off trail a bit because a lot of people were passing by all evening. We are only .7 from the summit of blood mountain.Neels gap tomorrow for our first resupply. We all still have extra food but maverick is doing the best at catching up on his.It's suppose to be a cold one tonight. Around 26 degrees and we are looking forward to spending the night in Hiawassee at at mile 52.If this is posted, we made it to Neels gap and will post again in 2 days.","blackwell creek

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554249,"2/5: 42.9 low gap shelter - 14.7It got really cold last night and then it rained. The rain froze and our tents were coated with ice from the rain and so was the trail. I sleep in a fly creek ul2 with maverick and Ally has a copper spur ul1. I don't think maverick has been sleeping much and he's been grumpy. But so far it's ok.We got up around 7 and left camp around 730. We were .7 from the summit of blood mountain. There was a light coating of ice on the trail and we used our micro spikes. Maverick still went down the rocks three times as fast as us. It was foggy with no view.We had our first resupply box at neels gap. It was about 3.1 away and they didn't open until 9. We still have a lot of food in our packs.We hung out for a little while and got some stuff done and left around 11:30. Our packs were heavy with extra food but the sun came out. It was pretty warm all afternoon and a lot of people on the trails. We met 2 other thru hikers who were also heading to low gap shelter for the night.We didn't hike together but passed each other a few times. They are around our age and have moved a similar pace so far.There were a couple tough climbs today and also some really easy ridge walks. Hardly any dirt road crossings and a few paved roads.Maverick did well and kept up all day. He needed a few extra short day naps with the climbs but so did we. He was still running around with a stick in camp as he normally does. His pads look great and he's eating a ton. Hopefully it stays that way.He's still a bit protective to anyone near our relaxing spot but I think he's starting to be more comfortable. The rest of the time he just gets a little to excited to be near other people or just walks by without noticing them.We got to camp around 530, set up our tents away from the shelter, made dinner, drank a bunch of water, fed maverick a few times, chased him around, and discussed plans for tomorrow.We are all a bit tired and plan on getting a ride into Hiawassee and staying the night in town.Our spot is out of the wind and it will be around 30 degrees tonight.Ally is looking forward to Big ALS pizza buffet in town.","slaughter creek

Maverick slept well and straight through the night and we all woke up before 6 and got on trail around 615.It was a long but easy climb up in the dark and we had a sunrise at the top around 715. We only had 9.6 miles till town and we were looking forward to it.Around 5 miles in at 815 we stoped for a break on a ridge. The weather was great and so warm out. The trail got really rocky towards the end but we kept up a great pace till the road crossing. Maverick was getting grumpy and we took a break at blue mountain shelter before descending off the mountain to unicoi gap.I made it there with maverick and got us a ride right as Ally walked out of the woods. The lady was super nice and even waited for us to figure out our room for the night. We mad it there around 1230We got a room at the budget inn of Hiawassee. Maverick went to sleep right away and we unpacked all of our stuff. Dried our tents and washed our socks.We went and got some French fries down the road and then went to the grocery store.,"Low gap shelter

It's a breakfast diner type place where we got waffles and omelets. It was super good and we talked about plans for todayMaverick seemed pretty energetic and ready to go so we packed up and checked out. We were also bored and wanted to get out of there.So we decided to leave without any pizza.The rain predictions have been changing but it looks like thunderstorms were going to start around 4. We were hoping to make it over 2 big mountains before that.We walked to the edge of town around 1030 and tried to hitch a ride back to the trail. Unicoi gap 2 miles up the road then right 10 miles up another road. A cool guy with a truck picked us up pretty quick and I jumped in the bed with maverick. He was going the other way and dropped us off at a gas station around the right hand turn. We got a ride really quick with a guy from Kentucky.I was in a t shirt going up the two mountains. It got really windy near the top. Tray mountain shelter was surrounded by thick fog and the wind was going right inside, so we pushed on to the gap and set up at 330 right as the rain started.A lot of down time in our tents, but I'm still not sure how getting wet maverick into the tent will go.Some entries will be shorter. I can only post in town with wifi and sometimes pictures will be posted late if the wifi isn't great.","unicoi gap

It was drizzling a little bit. We got up around 645 and on trail a little after 715.It stopped raining in the middle of the night and it was really warm. I slept really well and so did maverick.Maverick seemed pretty normal today. Well rested and more like his normal relaxed self. So far, he's still protective but he's getting much better.We were fogged in all morning. At dicks creek gap, a little over 9 miles, we ran into another thru hiker by the name of bill. We took over an hour long lunch break around 12. The sun came out and it was a great place to cook up some oatmeal.We saw Ron again! That was cool. He dropped off another thru hiker who went by nickel. It was about 70 degrees this afternoon and we were in t shirts again. We pushed on and reached the shelter around 3 and combined couscous and a Mexican rice side for dinner. Nickel showed up a little later and we tented behind the shelter.It started raining around 5 so we were forced to our tents. Maverick passed out.Tomorrow's low is supposed to be around 22 degrees!","streeltrap gap

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554487,"2/9: deep gap - 11.2As we went to bed we heard thunder off in the distance and eventually it was right around us. It thundered and poured for half the night then let up.Around the time we usually wake up, it was raining again. It looked like freezing rain and then turned to hail. We both waited until the sun started to come out before we started moving and slowly broke down camp. We were on trail around 815, there was a dusting of hail/snow and it was cold. We kept moving until we hit the GA/NC border and we took a break. Right after that we had a beautiful climb up a really windy and steep ridge. It was cold.We kept pushing and made it to muskrat creek shelter, which was 4 miles from deep gap. We made some oats and talked about plans. We wanted to stay at standing Indian shelter (about a miler after deep gap) because it was at the base of a big mountain but we also could have tried to make it over the mountain. It was cold and we phoned one of the numbers to try to get a shuttle in from deep gap. The road was closed so we walked down the road 2 miles and met them at 300. It was a fast walk and was worth it to miss the 15 degree and windy weather. We would have been fine in the shelter but we agreed we would all be much happier eating pizza for dinner and sleeping in a bed. Dominos.Maverick passed out right away, we ate, ran to the store, took showers, looked over our gear, and then passed out.","plumorchard gap shelter

He gets antsy inside.They said they could get us a shuttle back out at 930. We got a ride with David. He does a local shuttle and was a great guy to talk to. He dropped us off at the road block, which I tracked at 2.1 miles on my GPS. It was just as easy on the dirt road going back in and we walked it in about 35 minutes. Ron Haven said they close the upper road because people drive up there, ruin the roads by sinking in, then they get stuck and get frozen in place. Definitely inconvenient for us.We both agreed it was totally worth it to get a ride in for the night. We are so early and maverick (and we) can use the breaks.Sunny and warm while going over standing Indian mountain. It was a super easy and enjoyable climb and our first time up to 5500 feet. The weather was beautiful and really good hiking weather.Easy walk down on the other side and we stopped at carter gap shelter for a rest break around 3. It was 3.7 miles to the campsite. The ground was frozen in places all day, so it was warm warm, but it was nice clear and sunny skies. Betty Creek gap is closed for camping. It's between a big burn section on a ridge and a mountain. Both don't allow camping and there was nothing posted before but we ended up making it work.","deep gap

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554499,"2/11: winding stair gap - 12.2It was really windy above us last night. We were in a comfortable place surrounded by mountain laurels.It was a dry morning though and not too cold. I think maverick is adapting to sleeping outside now and seemed comfortable last night.We tented at the summit of Albert Mountain last night. Albert mountain has a fire town, it marks the 100 mile mark, and it's the first steep ""scramble"" on the AT. It's a short and steep climb on the south and a long and gradual decent in the north side.The summit was foggy and windy with a little mist/rain. We skipped the fire tower and moved on. A little after we took a breakfast break. Mavericks didn't eat this morning. Not sure why.About 5 miles before winding stair gap and half a mile before rock gap, we started seeing a lot of day hikers. There was a good amount of people even with the wet weather. There are a ton of road crossings in this area.We like seeing new faces and talking, but we were just trying to beat the rain which was coming around 2.When we got to winding stair gap we threw out our thumbs and had a ride to Franklin within a few seconds of stepping on the road.  We both feel weird going into town so much, but there aren't cheap motels the whole way. We are taking advantage of it while we can, and while the weather is still colder. For the most part, we try to go in for a stay and get what we need done and move on.They gave us the same room we had the other day for 10 dollars off. I picked up the box with mavericks dog food, we went to the outfitter to socialize and get canisters for our stoves, we ate at the diner, and went to ingles for our resupply. It's suppose to rain tomorrow, so we might take it slow out of here. Next stop is the NOC in a few days where we will get a box, then 2 days to Fontana dam.There has been a change in the plan, maverick will be staying with loving care kennels in Pigeon Forge, TN between Fontana dam and standing bear hostel because he isn't allowed in The Great Smoky Mountain National Park. This is 75 trail miles.If you have any information about Loving Care Kennels, please let me know! Positive, negative, what you've heard around town - please email me. Thank you.","betty creek gap

He eats some weird stuff.We planned on hitching out around 1030 but Sly, the guy at the desk at the budget inn, offered to bring us up. Dudes a triple crowner. We were on trail around 1115. Last weather update said rain around 1 and it was already wet and humid in the mountains.We made it up to Siler bald and it was too foggy to see anything so we didn't walk the extra .2 to the summit. We did find someone's dog though. I stayed at the trail junction with maverick and Ally ran back to bring the dog to the owners. From there we were cruising, and passed a lot of people. Today was like an easy going rollercoaster. We went 2 steps up then one step down a few times and finally made it to Wayah bald. It starting raining about 4 miles before the shelter but it wasn't very hard. It eventually stopped. We were lucky enough to score a foggy view on Wayah bald. Can't win them all out here and we were happy to see something. Good weather the rest of the way down to the shelter and we met 2 other thru hikers at the shelter. They started after us.

The low has been hovering around freezing in the near by towns. Subtract a few degrees for every 1000 feet of elevation.A few ups and downs but not bad. We took our normal morning breaks to shed layers as the temperature went up and to eat food.We took an hour long break at Wesser bald and had a clear view from the fire tower.After lunch we had around 6 miles to the NOC, and it was a huge decent. Ally and I split up for the last 4 and a half miles. Maverick and I shouted up to the outfitter at 320 and picked up our box and Ally came in 20 minutes after. They closed at 4.We packed our new 2 day resupply into our bags, threw out our trash, and kept walking north.

We were worried that we might not sleep with the noise but we both slept fine. We got up and climbed our way back up to the trail. Today wasnt too bad but it was a bit tough. It was a long uphill from the NOC (1700 ft elevation) to Cheoah bald (around 5200 ft) it was just a lot of uphill. We took a hour for lunch at sassafras gap shelter around 11 and called the dog kennel to arrange the pick up. She said she would have a hard time getting there Thursday during the day and Wednesday evening was better.We planned on doing around 13 miles today but pushed the extra 3 miles to get to the shelter.One of the thru hikers we met yesterday was at the shelter. He said the other guy he was with took a day at the NOC to rest his shins.We checked the weather and it's suppose to rain tonight and tomorrow morning.Overall, today was a beautiful and fun day, but it just took a little longer with the elevation gain","NOC/stealth

Ally woke up first and we both made some tea. We waited for the sun.We packed up our wet tents and were back on trail around 745. It was foggy, chilly, and windy.The trail was much easier than yesterday though. We walked 5 miles to our first break at a stream and everyone was a bit tired already.But we kept going and it got a little steep. There was a view of the dam and the smoky mountains.We called the dog kennel again around 1230 when we were about 3 miles away. She said she would meet us at the shelter at 5. The Fontana shelter is also called the Fontana Hilton because it's big, has a great view, has a heated bathroom, hot water showers and it's just a nice shelter.We at lunch/early dinner around 1 when we showed up and dried our tents in the sun. The sun and the wind both came and went.The longest I've spent away from maverick has been 2 days.Lida from the kennel showed up at 4 and surprised us. She brought us our 2 boxes and let us grab what we needed for the smokies and agreed to bring the rest to us at standing bear. Ally also left her tent and we are going to share my double if we need to. Hikers are required to sleep in shelters in the smokies. NON-thru hikers have to reserve a spot in the shelter. Thru hikers don't but if the shelter is filled, a thru hiker has to tent.We took hot showers and chilled out in the warm, smelly bathroom. The weather said a low of 26 tonight and it should warm up over the next few days.We both have 5 days of food but are hoping to make it through in 4 - 4.5 days.","brown fork gap shelter

We followed the AT down the road a ways and crossed Fontana Dam. The uphill into the mountains wasn't that bad but it was cold.A few miles in we left our packs at the trail and took a quarter mile side trail to Shuckstack fire tower. We couldn't make it all the way up the tower with the wind and turned back near the top.Around noon we hit Mollies ridge shelter and met back up with the thru hiker ""Young Blood"" who we have been bouncing back and forth with. I ate potatoes and oatmeal and al had oatmeal.After the shelter it was 5.9 miles to where we stayed and it was much easier going. We took a break half way but still made it in before 4.In the smokies, all of the shelters have fireplaces in them and the front is closed off with a tarp. Ally wanted a fire so we gathered wood and made one. The shelter was a little smokey but it was a little warmer.Young blood (YB) was here too and we have the same plan as him, so we should be together for the next few days.","fontana dam shelter

The morning hiking was a little tough. There was ice on the trail in places. It was cold. After a steep climb, we saw the best sunrise on trail so far.We took a few breaks but pushed on to derrick knob shelter for breakfast. It was around 5 miles by 9:30 ish. I ate a bunch of Nutella, cookies and oatmeal.Everything after the shelter was much easier. The cold let up and the sun came out. The trail was much more gradual. Ally and I both put some tunes on and split up for the afternoon.We met back up at 12:30 at siler bald shelter about 11 miles in. We took a lunch break and Ally changed into her lighter weight leggings. Back on trail around 1 and it was about 4 miles to clingmans dome. We hiked together the rest of the way. We passed a big group of hikers heading south on the AT and we talked to a couple. The trail got a little icy and snowy on the way up but only small very light spots. It was really warm even as we got up into the pine forest.Clingmans done is the highest point on the AT at 6600 feet and there is a large spiral tower on top. It's looks like a big ramp or oversized slide. The road up to the tower was closed. No one else was up there and we hung out and read the description signs. We headed down through the spruce pine forest, went over Mt Colin's, then went half a mile down a side trail to get to the shelter. The way down reminded us of Vermont.Today was a great day. I never imagined we would have such warm weather and so few people. Tonight was not as cold as the night before. I ate 2 rice sides and ally ate one pasta side and some instant potatoes. Halfway through the smokies, and halfway to getting maverick back.As the sun went down a guy by the name of chuck came in for the night. He went to university of Tennessee and decided to set his hammock up in the shelter. It took some thinking but he did it. We had a few laughs.","soence field shelter

It was cold and dark walking the half mile back to trail. Any off trail walking is a bummer but the shelter was nice and blocked by the wind. You have to stay in shelters in the smokies. It was all thick pines this morning and a fair amount of down hill. A little kid asked me if it was really going to be 2.2 miles uphill. About 4 miles in we took a break at newfound gap and threw out our trash. Weather report was mostly a low chance of showers late in the afternoon.My mom said she would call mid way through to see how maverick was doing and we got a text update saying he was doing great and had another German shepherd to play with.A big uphill and crowded trails followed. We stopped for a breakfast break a little later at a shelter. It was crowded with people. We talked to a few of them and exchanged information about where we were from but we were on our way pretty quickly. It was icy on the way down the other side. It was around a mile further, and 13 miles in, that we hit Charlie's Bunion and we had some great views. You close climb out on this rock/cliff and look down into a valley.After that, it was all steep ridge walking and we had some great views of the mountains we just climbed. This was my favorite part of the smokies so far.A little after we were back in the woods and rolling over mountains. A few rain drops but nothing major. I rambled to ally to pass the time.We got to tri corner shelter early. It was about 3:45 and we were super hungry. Al ate 2 pasta sides and I ate one rice and a big bowl of oatmeal with almonds and dried fruit.Ally, YB and I sat and talked until it got dark.It rained a little around 7:00.

I was really excited to get out of the smokies.We saw a few day hikers on the way down but didn't really stop for anything until Davenport shelter. It was about 14 miles. We made it there a little after 12 and ate breakfast and killed some time before finishing off the last 3 miles to standing bear.Somewhere on the way down I called Lisa at the kennel and asked if she could meet us at 230. She sounded inconvenienced by the call but assured me that her grand daughter and ""baby daddy"" would be there and quickly ended the call. I called back to remind her to bring out drop boxes, as she told me to, and she again seemed inconvenienced and irritated.We made great time on the last 3.6 miles and the sun came out. It got pretty hot!We passed our first major interstate. I-40. We walked under it. Everyone at standing bear was pretty friendly to us. Especially the guy out front. I don't know his name but he showed us around and told us to get comfy even though we were passing through. Ally scoped out the resupply and I sat in a rocker out front waiting for maverick. We were looking forward to moving on and sleeping in our tents again.Lidas grand daughter showed up with maverick around 245 and was just as unprofessional as Lida. Maverick was back though.We packed our bags and pushed on uphill for 2.1 miles. It was hot and we were both really tired and sweating. Maverick was happy.We got to the campsite at 4 and chilled out with a campfire and felt happy to be back in a national forest and out of the national park.","Tri corner knob shelter

There were a ton of people everywhere on trail.I woke up feeling a bit groggy and the uphill didn't help. It was about 2000 feet of climbing till snowbird and then another 2.4 miles till water.There was a great view on top and it started to get warm on top but cold on the other side. We took a break at the water source and I ordered mavericks dog food for hot springs. A little further was a shelter a quarter of a mile off trail. We skipped it and later found out there were 22 Boy Scouts there. Ally and I split up for a while on the uphill. We cover more ground separately. Later in the afternoon I saw a guy at a road crossing and thought it was for the Boy Scouts. It was trail magic and I walked by. Bummer. More uphill to max patch and Ally and I regrouped at a water source around lunch, talked to another thru hiker for a while, and then went on and walked over max patch together. It was packed with people.We took another break on the other side because maverick was hot, but overall, he was doing great today even with the people.Everything died down after that. We did meet a trail maintenance crew and talked to a couple at the shelter 4 miles before our stop. Everything after the shelter was easy and there was one last climb up to walnut shelter.It's on a ridge and we camped on a ridge. It wasn't windy so we started a fire and then it got windy around 730 and we put it out early and went in our tents.The other hiker, YB, has been on the same schedule as us since the day before the NOC showed up a little before we wrapped up the fire.

We got up at 545 and started moving in the dark around 6. Ally and I split up.We met back up mid climb on bluff mountain and we walked a bit together but split up again on the other side.The weather was great this morning. A little windy but it let up as the day went on. Around 5 miles in we stopped for a breakfast break as we normally do and split up for the last 7 miles. I showed up to the hostel around 12. It's the first building you see when the trail hits hot springs. Then the trail walks through hot springs.I found the manager and settled up for our room. There was another dog here and maverick was getting rowdy. The other dog was far less energetic and playful.Ally got in a little later and we both hung out in the room at the hostel for a while. We both felt tired and didn't feel like doing much. Maverick passed out like always.Eventually, ally went to the store down the road and picked up stuff to make quesadillas, home fries, and breakfast burritos in the morning. I hung out and when she got back I went and picked up a few things.We mostly just hung out for the evening. We shared a tub of ice cream and had a beer. It was nice.","walnut shelter

We didn't do any hiking, but walked around town a bit.Ally made corn bread, breakfast burritos, and home fries for breakfast and we hung out and drank coffee with young blood. He got in a little after us yesterday.That killed most of the morning, till about 10.We both went to the outfitter and store a few times. Ally played some solitaire and bought some shorts and socks.. Mavericks dog food was set back by Presidents' Day so it wasn't going to arrive until late today so we waited.It didn't get there till 4 and we had to mail half of it out. It's a 15 pound bag. So we'll have to make a stop tomorrow. They open at 9.We are also sending some gear home: our micro spikes and I'm sending my trekking pole home.We did some other small stuff but had a nice relaxing day. Crank pants, another thru hiker, showed up early in the morning and we talked with him a lot today.

Ally finished off the home fries and eggs and I made pancakes and had some cereal. A pipe busted during the night and the water cut out mid breakfast so we tried to wrap everything up the best we could and got out of there.We both really enjoyed our stay at the hostel. We were a little bummed that we couldn't go to elmers because of maverick, but found the laughing heart to be an awesome alternative.Around 9 we made our way to the post office, which is on trail and in the direction we were going. One box to Damascus with half the dog food, and another with gear. Along with the micro spikes, ally and I both sent home an extra layer. We both still have some cold weather gear and plan to keep it for most of march.It's suppose to be 79 degrees tomorrow.After the post office we walked the rest of the way through town and got back on trail. As always, maverick was happy to be back off leash and walking.On our way up the mountain, cranky pants was walking back towards us. He said he just wasn't feeling it and was going to set up camp by the water for a bit.He also gave ally the trail name Little toe because she was telling him about her problems with her little toe the night before.So we will go by Iceman, Little Toe, and French FryMaverick was given the name French fry because one of the guys who gave us a ride was feeding him French fries while driving and he about climbed up in the font seat to take them from him.After saying goodbye, we kept going. It got pretty hot and we found a cold beer at the top.About 8 or so miles in we hit a side trail to the Rich mountain fire tower. It was about .2 of a mile to the tower and we went to check it out. It was pretty good. The fire tower was a little sketchy with holes in the floor.We planned on staying at the shelter 11 miles in but it was only 330, it was on top of a windy mountain, and there wasn't much for tent spots. So we kept going to the gap and it was mostly out of the wind.The water was a little bit of a walk down the side trail, but it was there.

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555258,"2/24: big butt/rock peak - 16 There was a long uphill after a bit of downhill today. We passed Allen gap early and debated if it was worth it to walk .2 of a mile to see if a store was open to try and get breakfast sandwiches. We didn't go and stayed on trail.  About 6 miles in we took our breakfast break at a shelter. The wind was picking up and it was warm but not hot. We both made oatmeal and maverick took a nap. He got a bit tired early this morning and stopped again at a water source close to the top. There was no view at the summit but a little further and we made it to the firescald.The firescald is a really awesome rocky ridge with crazy good views. It was about 1.5 miles and much harder than the rest of the day. Ally and I split up a bit before it and we ended up taking breaks at different times, and we didn't meet back up until the shelter.Around 14 miles in, i met a group at the shelter. There was one guy going sobo on the AT, (finishing a thru hike I think?) and 3 other day hikers. We didn't talk much and they all took off.I hung out then went to get water and Ally was there when I got back. As we sat and talked, Red, a section hiker we met in hot springs came up. We talked for a bit and he told us about a couple he met last night going from hot springs to Erwin. They also had a dog. As he told us, they came walking up.Maverick has mostly gotten over his over protectiveness on trail, but still gets really excited to see other dogs. The puppy in him just wants to play, and he plays hard. Most other dogs, like this one, are older and not nearly as interested in interacting. It makes for a tough time and I normally just have to keep him separated. This is something he does off trail too, he's a young energetic dog, and that's why he's here.They didn't talk much though and we mostly walked to red and hung out till both groups left. We got enough water to camp where there was no water and continued another 2 miles.Our campsite was a small field. It was windy all day, and it was windy here too. We made a fire, cooked dinner and crashed out. Ally checked the weather and a possible storm tonight till 7-8 AM.

It went all night and turned to thunderstorms towards 7 when we woke up. We caught a break around then and tore our tents down. It started to rain pretty hard after we stepped out.It was down hill for a while and about 5 miles to a shelter. We made it there around 9. As we walked in, another couple with a dog, left heading north. The ones from last night.The rain let up right after we got to cover, and right as they left it. Full sunshine.We dried out for about an hour and ate some oatmeal. I spilt hot water on myself because my stove is old and has needed to be tightened since summer. Around 10 we continued going uphill for a while, then back down and we crossed a few roads. We passed a group of 5 wild pups and maverick was wicked stoked. We thought about walking to a hostel for some pizzas. They had signs posted for a ways.Ally ended up walking 150 yards to one while Maverick and I waited at a creek. She didn't get anything and we kept moving. The trail was steep and it was windy with full sunshine.We didn't plan on staying at the shelter we slept at, but it was stocked with good, dry, split wood and a tarp by the maintainer. We were going to pack water and stealth it in a few miles but there wasn't anything listed. So we made a fire and I practiced a few knots I learned by putting up the tarp. I've been getting better at starting fires. Weird to think that I didn't make one fire while hiking in 2015 and only sat at a few.A couple who was about our age came in a little later and I set up my tent so maverick wasn't in the shelter. They were getting ready to hike the PCT and had 3800 miles logged. It's gonna be a cold one tonight and we are planning to push as far as we can get.I'm not sure how much further I'm going to get with maverick. He's doing the miles, but he is still acting overly protective when people approach us. Once they are settled in, he is extremely nice as he always has been. It's disappointing because he's never done this and I thought I would have broken it by now. He's never acted like a guard dog but maybe he's still just too young. I'd rather stay, but I don't want this behavior to stick so for now I'm trying to make it to Damascus.

It was too cold and windy to stop.So we kept moving all morning and made it to the top of big bald pretty quick. It was one of the best views yet and was one of our longest walks on a bald. It was still wicked cold. We stopped for water on the way up and we kept our filters in our pockets so they didn't freeze.On the other side we took our first break at a shelter about 10 miles in. It was about 10:00. We met 3 guys who were south bounding the AT from august till now.It was warming up but still to cold to sit for a while. We moved on and took another break for some water and I brought up the idea of pushing all the way to Erwin.We did around 14.5 miles by 12 and had about 6 miles to the shelter. We talked about it over a water break and then made it to the shelter around 3.Ally made potatoes and someone left garlic salt in the shelter. We moved on at 330 and it was 6 miles to the hostel.We didn't have a solid plan for when we got there but we wanted tot try to get our box at the hostel and hitch into town. There was a motel there and we didn't think the hostel was cool with dogs.When we showed up at 545 they were having a little party on the deck and invited us to join.

There was no rain and the sun even shined for a few seconds on top. But roan is dense spruce on top.We met 2 guys at carvers gap after coming off the mountain who told us about the storm warming again and said it was suppose to start any minute.After that it was all exposed balds for 2 miles or so.

Then about 3/4 of a mile in, thunder and lightning struck a few times but we just kept going and made it back under the tree line. It was raining so hard.The trail down to the first shelter was completely flooded and it up to our ankles at some parts. The rain let up, but then started raining extremely hard again before the shelter. We both rain the last bit and stood uncomfortably in the shelter and talked. I took mavericks pack and we set out in a regular rain fall for the next shelter in 1.9 miles.Overmountain shelter is an old barn. It's .3 off the trail and we were lucky that the rain let up a second time and we just had a drizzle to light rain to the shelter.We watered up right before it and were happy to see the upstairs was closed in. We set our tents up, changed our clothes, dried off maverick, did a few laps to dry wet clothes, and ate dinner.Overall, it was a really great place to be during the storm. It did pour on and off through the evening, and we could hear the wind a lot, but not 1 in hail or 60 mph winds.

Everywhere we stood, we were ambushed and surrounded by a bunch of unleashed dogs. Someone had a pony. Maverick likes ponies a lot because they don't bark in his face.One house, on the hill and right before the road starts winding up the mountain, had +6 medium sized dogs running in the road.So we had to walk back and forth a few times looking for a good flat spot without turns or dogs. We pushed one of our boxes back. We planned on picking it up at V/A memorial hostel, but we didn't know if it was open. We sent it to Boots off hostel instead. So we were able to walk around 9 miles without food today.Boots off hostel is a cool place. It's new and we planned on staying there last night, but due to the weather, we didn't make it.

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555872,"3/7: woodchuck hostel/Damascus - 0I didn't sleep in much today. I guess I was too excited and ready for some waffles. We went inside the hostel around 730 and found woodchuck had the table all set for us and he threw on some blueberry waffles. They were so good. Ally was happy to have some coffee and drank a ton.After that we went for a walk with maverick around town. It was warm. Once we got back, we slowly accomplished a lot of stuff and split up watching maverick and wandering around doing town chores alone.Woodchuck let us use some bikes so we went out on a few bike rides, we mailed a box of food to Atkins (75 miles north), and we went to resupply at the grocery store. In between, we made a bunch of food. The bikes made everything really easy and we both hadn't been on a bike in years.It was suppose to rain all day, but it didn't start until 5, which was after we finished doing what we had to do. We made cookies and read other people trail journals for a while, then went to bed at 830.Our stay at the woodchuck hostel was in my top few favorites, but I didn't stay at too many last time. I stayed at ""the place"" last time and I would definitely recommend this over that. There is a price difference but the woodchuck hostel offers a lot more.I changed the layout of the photos menu, so it should be easier to view. Also, I really enjoy writing these, but sometimes it's really tough to get myself to do it at the end of the day. I just type them up quick, so I know there are a lot of grammatical and spelling errors. Most of the time I'm too lazy to reread them before posting, but I normally read them later on and find the errors funny.I've also been posting more pictures than I have before. It doesn't take much more time to do the extra ones, so I haven't been holding back. Thank you to everyone who is reading. If you would like to shout out to us, please do, we would love to hear from you .As of right now, I am happy to be out here doing something I like doing.","woodchuck hostel - damascus, va

We roles out of bed and had an awesome waffle breakfast and a good conversation with woodchuck. After that we hung around for a bit and packed up slowly. We also packed two boxes to mail our. One was to trents grocery, and the other was a small envelope of gear we didn't need.I was really full, but I made some food and finished off some leftovers before we left. I figured I'd rather eat real hot food now than bars later. That was around 1030 and we left a little before 11. We stopped at the post office and dropped of the boxes. I accidentally mailed the food drop to Atkins, which we already mailed yesterday, so we had to turn around and fix that. It was suppose to go to trents grocery. We didn't make it more than a minute or two down the road. I wasn't thinking when I went in, no problem though. It was an easy fix.From there we left Damascus. We really enjoyed our time spent there, mostly the bikes though. Those were fun. But now it was back to walking. We had about 3 and a half days of food. I brought a really big navel orange too. I planned to eat it tomorrow.Warm weather, shorts, and not a lot of people on the trail, but we did pass a few. Around halfway through we passed a group of 7-8 who looked college age. They ended up showing up to the pond we camped at after us and there wasn't a lot of options for tenting, especially for their large group, but they made it happen. Then more of them came from the opposite direction to join them.While the pond wasn't the most beautiful pool of water we've stayed at, it was a nice campsite. We made a fire and went to bed.","woodchuck hostel - damascus, va

We got on trail around 7 and we're heading back down in elevation to meet up with the creeper trail again. It was still following the water and it was really cold down there. We were happy we stayed where we were and didn't try to push on.From there we went uphill and took a morning break at a shelter and then continued up to the summit of whitetop mountain. It was a pretty long way up but I broke out the orange right at the start and we shared it. Then we split up and met back up at the summit. It was a beautiful view and the temperature was warmish/chilly with a breeze. Ally had service and checked the weather. It was a major change in weather since we were in Damascus and the next 5 days were below 20 degrees at night. It looked super cold.Later in the day we passed a major trailhead parking area and were able to empty our trash out. After that there was a lot of people. We passed up the .5 to summit Mt. rogers and kept moving to pass by the people. Thomas knob shelter was packed with a huge group of college kids. We assumed most of the people we passed were in college, and on break.Greyson highlands was even more crowded, but the views and weather were both beautiful. It got pretty rocky and there was a lot of mud.Tenting isn't allowed in Greyson highlands, which is about 2.5 miles or so, so we planned on staying at wise shelter. We didn't plan on there being so many people, and we got a little nervous we wouldn't get a tent spot. The crowds let up about 1.5 miles before the shelter and we didn't see anyone.The shelter was empty, but you can't camp there, so we pushed on about .2 miles and camped in the camping area across the creek.Oh yeah, and we saw some ponies. Greyson highlands is known for the feral ponies. There was pony poop in our field/tenting area. Hopefully we don't get ambushed by ponies during the night!","stagnant pond

Once we got on trail it started drizzling and rained on and off. The trail was flooded in some places.The nice clear views and warm weather we had yesterday was now all fog. Where we tented was an opening surrounded by thick trees. Within a few minutes of walking we were crossing a really big field. The field was super windy and cold.On the other side was a fenced in cattle grazing area that we passed through. I waited on the other side for ally and the visibility was under 50 feet. She had to call out my name in the middle to see if I stopped.We kept moving together for a while and it was pretty rough. Eventually we split up and I made it to the shelter before her. I looked forward to laying down on the shelter floor and getting out of the cold rain. I'm sure maverick did too, but when we got there it was completely packed with a college group from Minnesota. They were moving, but still in there sleeping bags. I hung out on the side, under the over hang and I talked to them for a while.They told me the rain would stop around 10. This was great news because we thought it was going to rain all day. They said it was going to be cold and confirmed that trimpi shelter had a fire place inside the stone shelter.Ally and I hiked on to the next shelter 4.2 miles further and made oatmeal there. It was empty but really windy and super cold. We ate a lot of oatmeal and another thru hiker tenacious D showed up before we walked off. He was at the last shelter with the college group.We talked and he said he might be at trimpi. We pushed on and moved much faster than the morning. The rain stopped and the sun came out. It was still cold and windy, but we were happy maverick could keep dry.We made it to the shelter before 3 and I started a fire in the shelters fireplace right away. Then we gathered a ton of wood for the night. Tenacious D and 2 other section hikers showed up. The section hikers left and tenacious D stayed and contemplated night hiking out. He hung out by the fire with us until 830 and then left.It's not common for there to be a fireplace in the shelter outside of the smokies, and we were really happy to have it. It kept us much warmer than our tents.","big wilson creek

The mice messed with some of Allys stuff but nothing was taken/harmed. I got up a little before our usual time and got the fire going again so we could heat up. Ally got up right after me and we both appreciated the convenience of sleeping in the shelter.That was the first shelter we've had to ourselves. Once we left the shelter we felt how cold it was. It wasn't nearly as bad as we thought it was going to be yesterday, but still in the 20s. It's mostly the wind that made it bad.As we normally do in the cold weather, we kept moving and didn't take many breaks.We passed the 2 section hikers and tenacious Ds tent on the way to the next shelter. It was 9.8 miles to the shelter and there was also a visitors center there. I was hoping to get a few extra snacks.The visitors center was closed, but we cooked up some oatmeal and the 2 hikers we passed showed up shortly after. They did the same thing and we all ate breakfast.From there it was bumpy with some steep uphill. It was really windy on a few ridges but we were just happy the skies were clear. It was 12 miles from our breakfast break to Atkins. After about 5 miles, the rest was mostly downhill. We had been hearing about possible snow tonight, so we were planning to stay at the relax inn. It's right on trail, where the trail passed through Atkins. Atkins is pretty much a truck stop off of I-81. We didn't plan on staying there and mailed our resupply to the barn restaurant across the street, but we figured it was a good opportunity to warm up and rest indoors.We check in at 330 and dropped our stuff off in the room. Even though our package was at the barn, we headed over to the Mexican place next door. What a great meal! I lived in San Diego for a while and love good authentic Mexican food. Ally and I were both really happy with the quality and quantity of the food. It was also wicked cheap.After that we grabbed and paid for our package and went back to the motel room. We went through our gear and cleaned up, but mostly just laid around for the evening. We were all really tired.We aren't picky, but the motel here definitely isn't one of the better places we've stayed.","trimpi shelter

I was surprised we slept so late, and we later realized the time change was last night.Either way, we slept really well. We hung out, discussed plans, and I tried to get the wifi in the lobby area for a while. It doesn't reach to the rooms.Then we went over to get breakfast at the barn around 915. We both were happy to have a solid breakfast before leaving. I would have went back to the Mexican restaurant, but it didn't open until 1130.Breakfast took a while. We took our time and got back to the room around 1030. We felt a little behind and rushed this morning. Normally, we are packed up and out the door by then. We left the room right at 11, and so did tenacious D, who showed up yesterday evening and was roomed next to us.We crossed under the highway and were back on the trail. It was chilly but was warming up right as we started walking. The sun was out. We went though a lot of pastures today. We both agreed the scenery was an awesome change and some of our favorite. We also climbed over a ton of fences. They all have some type of way to climb over or zigzag through them. It's hard to get maverick through sometimes and even harder to lift him over. Most are barbed wire, which are hard to get him under, and others are just regular fencing. We moved a nice relaxed pace today and talked on and off on the way. We took a long break on top of a really big hill in a field, and crossed the 1/4 way mark sign.Like most nights we had a fire and hung out around it until it got dark, which was now closer to 730.

Kind of a strange way to wake up I guess.We both didn't get up when we heard it. Once we got up with the sun, it was after 730. The time change is going to take some time to get use to.It was cold, but not too terrible. It felt weird to be on trail at 8 not 7. We knew it was going to rain later in the day, and we felt like we had gotten a late start. It wasn't too bad all morning, we stopped for a break at a shelter before making our way up to chestnut knob shelter. It's a long climb up. The first half is somewhat steep and the second half is really gradual and easy open walking. We saw on other guy hiking. We haven't seen anyone in a few days.It was also really windy towards the top. Sometime after our morning break we both changed to shorts. We had to bundle back up as we got closer to the summit.We stopped for a late, and long, lunch/oatmeal break at the shelter. It was around 1215. Chestnut knob shelter is not only on top of a mountain with an awesome, but it also has a door and an indoor picnic table. Super luxurious.The break ended up being so long because we were also able to check the weather and that made us rethink our plans a bit. Tonight was suppose to rain/snow until late morning and tomorrow was suppose to be a low of 8 degrees.We called a place in bland to see if they allow dogs and if they could pick us up tomorrow at a gap. They didn't answer and I left a message.Allys rain jacket zipper also broke, so she emailed outdoor research about it.The shelter was around 11 miles further and it was on a bumpy ridge. We headed out around 2. It was cold at first but then the wind died down. The clouds grew darker as we got closer to Jenkins.We were nearly running on the last mile to get to the shelter. It was close to 6, and we thought the rain was coming.We met a girl at the shelter and we talked a bit. It started to get dark around 745 and there was no rain before we went to bed at 830.We are hoping to get up a little earlier tomorrow.","possum creek

We all got moving pretty quick. I woke up a few times through the night to make use the rain and sleet wasn't coming in the shelter. It started sometime after we went to sleep and it was coming down pretty hard for a while.By the time we woke up, it was just snow flurries. There wasn't much snow on the ground, but the ground was covered in nearly an inch. Some areas of the trail were bare and melted, and others were not.We both started with our rain pants and jackets on and then we wore them the entire day. It was cold as we got moving in the dark but it wasn't that bad after a bitIt was a climb up to a ridge, then completely flat. The wind picked up on the ridge and maverick had a little stare off thing with a deer.As the day went on, it got much colder. I didn't sleep well last night and neither did ally. I never sleep well in shelters. It was mostly easy hiking though. A windy, snowy, foggy and grey skied winter day. It was really beautiful for a while, then it started to get too cold. We were lucky to get a few minutes of phone time before it shut off from the cold. I talked to the owner at Zero Days Hostel and we made the plan to stay the night.By the afternoon we were booking it. There was a 1.4 mile road walk over I-77 about 12 miles in and we debated getting the shuttle from there to the hostel, this is the main and fastest way into bland, but he is further north from Bland. So the shuttle from va611, which is a dirt road, was actually cheaper and allowed us to make it to where we planned to.It was 7.75 miles after the road walk and it was cold, windy and never ending. There were no land marks on the stretch and my phone was too cold to turn on, so we had to guess on timing. We didn't want the shuttle to wait on us, but we also didn't want to wait too long in the cold.Maverick was wet from the snow and it was slowly freezing from the wind. It's hard to defrost him in my tent.It was a much better option to stay inside and we were happy we arranged for the shuttle before hand. We made it to the gap at 214, which was right on time. We also made the detour to the grocery store in bland so we could make some food. Ally made the vegetable chili and I made pancakes as the appetizer. After that, we just veg'd out - like we always do. We looked over the plan, checked the weather a few more times, and then decided to do our first slack pack tomorrow.","jenkins shelter

The weather while we were eating breakfast said it was -7 when factoring the wind chill.The sun looked like it was going to stay out, so we stuck to the plan to slack pack. Slack packing is when you get dropped off back on trail, and hike with only what you need for the day. Afterwards, you get picked back up at another gap North of where you started. Just a day hike.It worked out for us because trents grocery, almost 10 miles north, was closer to the hostel than 611. Ally and I don't have anything against slack packing, but we weren't sure we would ever find a use for it. Today was a great day.We ate a great breakfast of eggs, home fries, pancakes (some with chocolate chips) and had some coffee. It was still in the teens around 10 so we pushed the drop off to 11. We even almost called it off.We were happy we didn't call it off once we got on trail. It was cold, but some spots were blocked really well and we were able to do the hike in less than 3 hours. It would have been a different story with packs and if we were dropped off and picked up by a climate controlled vehicle.Maverick (us too) go a little crazy sitting inside, so it was nice to get a quick walk in. Doing it without the gear is just an added bonus on top of lowering the miles to pearisburg. I didn't bring my camera on this stretch, but I snapped one photo on the phone. It was windy and cold, but nothing like yesterday. We picked up our box at trents grocery around 215 and waited a minute or 2 for the shuttle back to the hostel. We spent the afternoon and evening hanging out. We eventually got bored of just sitting on our phones. I read a bunch of journals. It's nice to have so much time, but I always crash after a little bit. Tomorrow should be warmer than these past few days, but still cold. 20s at night.

Nature boy, the owner of the hostel, drove us back out to trents grocery and almost picked up a really sketchy, NON-hiker hiker, hitch hiker.The hostel we stayed at, Zero Days Inn, was just starting up. We were happy it was there. It worked out for us really well, but it's still starting up, which made the stay a bit interesting. Super nice guy though.It was cold when we started. It seems like it's been windy every day for the last little while. Most of the trail has been on ridges here in Virginia, and there still aren't any leaves on the trees.It was easy hiking out of the trents road crossing. We were really happy to have finished up that slack-pack yesterday. It put us a nice distance from pearisburg, about 25 miles.We called woods hole hostel, which was about 15 miles out, and their bunk room wasn't open yet. They had indoor rooms, but between the two of us and the dog, it was a bit pricy for the night. We weren't trying to hang around too much because we felt we had been stuck inside the past few days. From what I've heard, it sounds like a great place.It was cold. I was able to warm up when going uphill, but any exposed skin was still cold from the wind.Overall, any easy day, but the trail was covered in 1-3 inches and it got rocky towards the end of the day. It was slippery and annoying because we couldn't see the rocks.We met a guy from CT who was just starting the last section hike of his south bound thru hike. Once he makes it to springer mountain this year, he will have hiked the trail in both directions - he will also be 74!As we got to the shelter, it started getting even colder and the shelter is in a very wet area. The ground was surrounded by way more mud than usual.We decided to set our tents up in the shelter to stay a little warmer. Maverick was wet so he had to hang out in the shelter for the evening.

The sky was dark grey until late morning and it was hard to tell what time it was.It was a short hike into pearisburg. It felt like it was taking us a while though. Towards the end there were two really nice views over looking pearisburg.On the last stretch in, we decided to stay the night in town. Everyone was a bit tired. We made a few different plans for when we got in. The hostel at the motor lodge doesn't open until may, so we planned to grab our boxes and go to another place. We called the other place and he said there was a wood stove, but currently no wood. He assured us he would TRY to deliver some wood, but he promised nothing.We walked .7 on the road into town and one of the first buildings in the motel. The lady was really nice. We told her we didn't realize the hostel was closed, and she offered us a room for the price of the hostel. We took it.I sent mavericks dog food here. It was a 15 pound bag. I split it, and took the other half to the post office. I mailed it to daleville, Va. where we will be in a few days.The 15 pound bag works out well. It normally covers 2 full resupplies for maverick. He has been eating around 6-8 cups of food a day. Out of choice, he also normally only eats once a day - in the evening.After that, ally and I went to pizza plus for the all you can eat pizza and salad buffet. It was a good meal. We didn't feel like we went crazy, but we ate a lot.After that, we split up and did some town chores. The grocery store is across the street, along with everything else we needed, so we made our rounds. We packed out our resupply and adjusted our plan over the next few days to daleville.It also rained from 17 till 8. The weather should warm up midday tomorrow, but then get cold again over night.

The post office didn't open until 10 so we went to rite aid across the street and looked around for a while.The lady at the post office was really nice and it needed up being really cheap to mail the box because it wasn't going very far.We walked down every street in the downtown pearisburg area and looked around. It's an interesting little town and there was a lot of people driving around but not many outside. After that we went back to the motel and decided to get some Mexican food for lunch. Ally called a few places to try to get a haircut but it never happened.The Mexican place was awesome. $1 off fajitas all Saturday.Then we went to goodwill and ally got a book. She spent the rest of the day reading and ended up finishing the book. I spent most of the day reading articles and journals on my phone. In between, we ate little snacks and I took maverick for a few walks. Overall, we felt like the weather wasn't so great and we are in no rush to pass or beat anyone, so we just hung out.

We ran across the street to food lion to mail a few post cards and grab a few last minute things.We left the hotel room around 9 and walked over to hardies and ally got 2 egg sandwiches.We walked back to trail and passed tenacious d on the way back out to the trail. We talked to him for a little bit and he said he was on his way to eat the AYCE pizza buffet at pizza plus.From there we crossed a bridge with a ton of cars flying by and it was really cold. We passed by a really large power plant or something and then we went back up into the mountains.Halfway up the climb we passed a landfill and eventually, we made it to rice field shelter. There is a really beautiful view there. Ally and I stopped for a break and switched from shorts to pants. From there it was bumpy and rocky, but pretty flat on a ridge. It was hailing/sleeting on us just about all day.We planned on camping at a spot on the ridge, but all the trees were frosted over and chunks of ice were falling. We continued down to the shelter another 5 miles.We met another hiker from West Virginia there. He was sectioning south for a month. He was an interesting guy who was retired and did a lot of traveling.The shelter was made of stone and had a fire place in it. He already had it going, but it wasn't too cold out.

There were 2 platforms on either side of the stone shelter, and a fireplace in between. Maverick, Ally and I slept on one of the bottom platform areas together, and there wasn't enough room. We were a little squished, but it was l definitely a roasty toasty night.The morning was warm too. It was downhill to a hilly section next to a creek where it was chilly. We almost pushed on to tent there and we were happy we didn't. About 1.4 miles in we made it to ""the captains place"" and we figured it was a pretty good time for a soda.A guy who lives on the other side of the creek put a zip line/pulley system up so hikers can slide across the creek and get a free soda from him back porch. The hiker we met last night said he doesn't like to come outside and talk, so we just made a quick stop.He had some rules posted by the creek and they said you are allowed to camp on his lawn. I waited with maverick by the creek when ally went over. The zip line is like a wooden playground swing and maverick would have had to just dangle. Like most people on trail, ally and I don't normally drink soda, but we chugged it down and kept moving. The day was filled with a few long and steep climbs and some pretty rocky and bumpy sections. We took a ton of breaks and didn't make very good time at all. We weren't too worried about it.We went up a big climb to the next shelter where we ate breakfast. Oatmeal, protein bars and other stuff. We were there for a little over an hour.The trail leveled off after that on top of a ridge, but it was rocky at times. Our pace wasn't much better than it was on the climb to the top. Then, towards the end of the day, the trail dropped off the ridge to War Spur shelter and went all the way back up over a mountain.We took a break at war spur and it was 5.8 more miles. It was a pretty tough climb and dark clouds started filling the sky. I made it to the top and checked out the view point before ally made it there and kept moving. Ally ended up skipping it because some rain drops we starting to fall.We both ended up making it to the shelter before the rain. It was suppose to start at 7, but it didn't start until after we got in our tents around 8. We made it to the shelter around 515-530.We almost gave into the convenience of sleeping in the shelter, but my tent has been wet in my bag for a while. We set up camp behind the shelter. I don't sleep very well in shelters. I like having my own space to organize all my stuff in. Everyone always says they don't snore, but they probably do and they probably have one of those loud crinkly sleeping pads too. Shelters are a community space, so it's always a gamble - unless you're a really deep sleeper.March is flying by! We've been laying down at night around 745 pretty consistently. When we get into camp, maverick normally passes out for about 30-45 minutes, wakes up, eats, then runs around and brings me sticks trying to play and then passes out in the tent when I go in. He then sleeps through the whole night and either wakes up with us, or wakes up with the sun and just sits and stares at me.","pine swamp shelter

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557592,"3/21: trout creek - 21.3Last night was one of the warmest nights yet. I slept in my short and a t shirt. When I woke up, I put my pull over sweatshirt on, and stayed in shorts.On trail around 8 this morning. There were some really nice fields a few miles in and we took our first break there. Shortly after, we crossed a road, went through some more fields, and we saw the Keffer Oak.The Keffer oak is a huge oak tree.After that we went up a really steep hill. Ally and I were both sweating a lot at the top. It was an 8 mile ridge. It was mostly easy but had some large rocky sections.Easier day than yesterday. Our campspot was right next to the road. It was still a nice spot. We made a fire, but the wind picked up a bit and it was blowing all over. It burnt Allys sweatshirt.","laurel creek shelter

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557766,"3/22: Catawba/four pines - 13.7My tent was on a slant last night. I didn't see it and thought it was flat, but right at the end it slanted down hill. I had to get up in the middle of the night and sleep backwards. Other than that it was a nice night. The wind was going off pretty hard above us but it didn't hit us.We woke up around the normal time, filled up some water on the way out because there wasn't much, and we started climbing up. Early on we passed the trail to the shelter. It was about 1.5 miles in and we skipped it. It was easy walking. We were definitely gaining elevation but it was smooth.Then we started getting closer to dragons tooth. The climb up the backside was windy and rocky. We split up, and were zigzagging in and out of large rocks while climbing up a steep ridge. The wind mostly made it feel harder than normal. My hands were really cold.At the top, I took the short side trail to the dragons tooth, but didn't climb up it. I skipped it last time too because of the rain. You can see through the gaps and the views along the way are enough for me.I waited for ally at the trail junction but it was too windy and I kept going.The other side of the mountain is even harder! It's rocky and super steep, but there wasn't any wind and it was warming up. Maverick does pretty well with scrambles but has a hard time with squeezes. He runs and jumps up and down big rocks much faster than I do.I passed a 2 groups of people and they seemed surprised at how well he hopped down the mountain.At the bottom, we made 2 plans. Take a left and walk down the road to the gas station, then walk back the opposite way to four pines hostel. Both were less than .5 in both directions.I got to the store before ally did and I hung out in the front and used their wifi. Maverick slept and waited very patiently as I went inside - the lady at the counter commented positively on his behavior.Ally showed up, we ate some food, and walk d the road back to four pines.We met joe Mitchell - the owner of the hostel - and talked with him for a while. He's definitely a talker and a really cool guy. We grabbed our box, sorted through our stuff, and lingered a little longer than we planned.As we walked out and made our way down the road, we made the choice to get shuttled back to the hostel in 6 miles. This way we still do some miles and get to hang out with everyone where for a while. It was also going to be in the 20s again.The weather was nice all afternoon. We walked on a beautiful ridge, and got picked up at the road crossing. This road is a few miles before mcafee knob, so we expected to pass a lot of people if we kept going.We ate a tub of ice cream, made some eggs, got a fire going in the wood stove and just hung out for the evening. There were a few other dogs there that maverick played/chilled with.","trout creek

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557767,"3/23: daleville - 19.8There was only one other guy in the 3 bay garage hostel and he was the care taker there. He woke up early with his dog, and so did ally and I. So we were up around 630.I made a ton of pancakes and we slowly got ready to leave. It was a bit of a slow and sluggish morning.We got shuttled out around 8 and picked back up where we were. It was really fast moving all day today and the trail through the first quarter of the day was wide and well used.We made our way passed 2 shelters in the first 2 miles and went over mcaffee knob around 3.5 miles in. We passed a few groups going different ways, or camping, but we had the view to ourselves.We took pictures, ate some food and moved on.Still easy moving after that and we were on a ridge for a while then hit tinker cliffs. We ate lunch at the cliffs and changed into shorts. It was getting warmer but still windy and chilly.The rest of the way we just cruised into daleville. Even with our later than usual start, we got to daleville at 5.Ally and I split up in daleville. She took a left and went to get a hair cut and go to the Kroger and I went right to drop maverick at the motel 6. It was rush hour and there was a ton of people driving pretty crazy. Daleville is a major stop on I 81 so there were tons of semis and even more cars. The motel 6 is on the other side of the interstate, and the road under it is really scary.The on and off ramps had cars flying on and off and there is no where to walk. Definitely stressful with maverick, but everything worked out fine and we made it to the motel.The motel was actually really nice.","catawba/four pines hostel

Iceman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559216,"The day after arriving in Daleville, I rented a car from Roanoke Airport and made my way back to Connecticut.There are a few reasons why, but mostly because I felt Maverick needed a break. Physically, he was going but he just seemed a little worn out. Daleville is such a convenient place to leave from because the AT crossed I-81. I was really happy to have made it to that point.Having some time off was OK. I was able to take care of a few important things. Maverick had to see the veterinarian twice to make sure he is all good, I prepared and planted a garden, I fixed my car up, and I was here to see my family on my moms birthday.Maverick is doing great. I took him back so he could rest, and to have his hips and joints X-rayed. Waiting for the X-ray appointment is what held me up the second week.It’s weird how 2 weeks feels like such a long time. I could go back to the AT and still be early in the season, but I wasn’t into it this year. There are too many people doing the same thing. It’s awesome and exciting when it’s a new experience, but I want something different.Anyway, I spent a lot of Mavericks “forced rest time” planning a trip in New York. I will be writing a journal so check it out if you want. Thank you to anyone who read this journal. I really enjoyed writing these entries.","daleville
