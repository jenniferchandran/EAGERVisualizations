Knight Errant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554294,"Getting together freeze dried and dehydrated meals to package for the hike. I estimate 165 days, therefore 165 breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, with a goodly number subtracted for the times I will be passing through or near a trail town. Then add to that at least two snacks per day, if not more. My fear is losing too much weight. I lost 75 pounds in 2015 and have kept it off with no trouble since. Backpacking like this creates about a 6000 calorie daily deficit and my normal eating is less than 2000 calories per day. I expect to lose another 20 to 30 pounds on the hike (early is good), but if I lose more than that I could be in trouble. There are plenty of stories about hikers' voracious appetites on the trail, shown when passing through towns, but limited the rest of the time by what you can carry. I will be boxing up my supplies based on weekly intervals and Martha will ship them to post offices along the way where they will hold them till I arrive. Now to estimate my travel per week, but week, subtracting supplies for towns.",,"Mt. Katahdin, ME","Feb 07, Tue",0
Knight Errant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554433,"This morning I packed my gear into my pack for the first time to get an idea how much I was going to have to take back out to get under my 35 pound limit. With almost everything packed, with a few unnecessary items, BUT WITHOUT FOOD, my pack weight was 25 pounds and a few ounces. I was shocked. This included my tent, pack, stove, water purifier, and gear. This is much better than I expected. Add food and water and I should be at my limit or slightly over since 3 liters of water adds 6.6 pounds. This weekend I will go out to a state park, hike some miles and practice setting up my tent and using my equipment. I am still somewhat anxious about being ready on time.5 million steps, one at a time.",,Mt. Katahdin,"Feb 10, Fri",0
Knight Errant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554534,"Saturday afternoon I traveled to Dinosaur Valley State Park to get in my first practice hike with my pack at a 70% load. My intention was to hike Saturday afternoon, set up my camp (for practice), and hike again on Sunday.I know the park, but apparently not well enough and got across the Paluxy River on the wrong side of Opossum Creek. After hiking a while it was obvious that I had to get back across the river and to do that at a reasonable water depth I had to cross Opossum Creek. This creek has about 30 or more yards of brush and briars on each side of the steep banks and deep water. After a good afternoon of hiking and fighting briars I was able to find a place and get across by scaling a sand cliff about 8 feet high to reach a slope where I could continue on. I did this while wearing a backpack. My legs and arms are a testament to the fight with the briars. And to make it more difficult I tried to use my 30 year old compass to coordinate my location on my map, just to find out that over the years it has become demagnetized. This, my friends, is why you take a practice hike with your equipment.The campsite worked well. Mt Big Agnes tent was fantastic. The best tent I have found in 40 years of looking. (The first one better than my $39 tent I bought 43 years ago). This new tent weighs in less than 4 pounds, including the lights. There is a string of LED lights sewn into the seam of the tent. A LIGHTED TENT !!! Today's hike went almost perfectly. I got used to using hiking poles because of a strong recommendation to use them. Excellent advice. I covered about 5 miles up and down the very hilly terrain and even took the side trail to the overlook. Plenty tired after about 2.5 hours on the trail. A good start to get used to carrying the pack. When I took it off I felt like I was floating. So I continue to prepare for the AT.",,Practice Hike Dinosaur Valley SP,"Feb 11, Sat",5
Knight Errant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554875,"On Saturday I hiked 3 miles to the Primitive Camping area at Lake Mineral Wells State Park to practice setting up and breaking down my campsite. This Sunday morning I hiked a combination of trails the took me almost 7.5 miles back to the trailhead. Parts of the Primitive Trail were exceedingly steep and rocky, but that is also good practice. I also met some outstanding new friends who were backpacking and camping.",,Lake Mineral Wells State Park,"Feb 19, Sun",7.31
Knight Errant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557529,"On March 18 I began my last shakedown hike before I was to start the AT. This was to be at day 27 mile hike, listed as the most difficult in Arkansas. I had pulled a calf muscle on the hike at Mineral Wells Lake State Park and believed it was healed. I was wrong. Immediately upon starting the Eagle Rock Loop it began causing problems. I also made the mistake of not having a good breakfast. An hour into the hike my energy was spent and my leg was seriously in pain. I continued my hike after eating a snack, and went another 8 miles and over one Ridge to get to an alternate trail head. It was much more difficult than it should have been, and my leg was in bad shape. Obviously it must be 100% BEFORE I start the AT. In the last 2 weeks I have seen 4 doctors about my leg and a problem I have had with abdominal pain. I see another doctor Monday for what might be a kidney stone. My hike cannot start to big of these problems are solved, but that will give me more time to prepare myself by getting a better balance between eating as a diabetic and a backpacker. I am hoping to get on the trail early in the second week of April if possible.",,"Eagle Rock Loop Trail, AR ","Mar 24, Fri",9
Knight Errant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557833,"My northbound attempt to thru hike the Appalachian Trail has been delayed while I take care of a couple of medical situations. My pulled leg muscle must be completely healed before I start. I learned this the hard way on the Eagle Rock Loop Trail in Arkansas.   The second issue was discovered today after having abdominal pains sporadically over the last month. I have two small (thank goodness) kidney stones that are moving. This also has to be taken care of before I start my hike, but this may take another week or two. In any case neither of these problems will allow for a successful hike.So I continue to study mail drops.",,Delayed Start for AT Hike,"Mar 25, Sat",0
Knight Errant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559557,"Two things were delaying my start this season for an attempt at a thru hike; kidney stones and a pulled muscle in my leg. I was ignoring the muscle letting it heal while I was trying to take care of the kidney stones. My urologist was very interested in helping me get the stones taken care of in order to get me on the trail as soon as possible, and went so far as to do a lithotripsy last Friday. It did not work as well as hoped because of location (in front of the artery that feeds the leg where some plaque was built up. To hit the stone a second time could have also broken up the plaque sending it down into the leg causing blockage problems there. So we can do no more now except to wait and see if the smaller stone (it did do some good) passes on its on. I guess it could pass this week and I could still get on to the rail, but normally he checks it every month for movement - telling me it probably wont be soon enough. So no AT this year. so look at all of the extra time I have for planning. I am sorry, and wish to apologize to those who were encouraging me on my adventure. But a kidney stone, alone on a remote section of the trail, would be too great a risk. So now I am a 2018 Hiker.",,"Doctor says ""No""","Apr 10, Mon",0
