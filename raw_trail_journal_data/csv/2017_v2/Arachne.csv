Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513937,"I've decided to hike the whole Appalachian Trail. It is the longest hiking-only footpath in America — and with 2,189 miles of trail, more than 250 shelters, and an overall elevation gain equivalent to climbing Mount Everest 16 times, it earns that title.Every year, a couple thousand people try to hike the AT from beginning to end in one season, and a few hundred manage to accomplish it and I am indeed hoping/intending to be one of them.You can read all about why I'm doing it here (copy and paste the URL address listed below into a new browser window): http://appalachiantrials.com/it-was-only-a-matter-of-time-why-i-am-attempting-an-at-thru-hike/A popular tradition of Appalachian Trail culture is to go by a trail name. These trail names are what you go by in lieu of your real name. They can either be bestowed upon you by your hiking mates or be one of your own choosing. Rather than risk being labeled by others due to some silly or dumb thing I get remembered for doing early on, (although there is no guarantee against that not happening), I instead have looked to my past to come up with something token to represent my future. I chose ""Arachne"" which is the name of the Greek goddess of weaving. It is the root word meaning spiders and was the name I gave to my computer hard drive when I worked in an advertising agency. I also contracted a tick-borne disease (ehrlichiosis) in the mid-1990s. Deer ticks and their ilk are members of the arachnid family. Thus, I carry a small personal connection in addition to having a weaving background. So, unless I do something incredibly stupid–or—memorable, Arachne it is.",,Getting Started,"Jun 30, Tue",0
Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513910,"Dates: July 31 - August 2, 2015Weather: High 70s to low 80s; sunny and clearMiles Hiked: 22Place: Ice Age Trail/Kettle Moraine Southern Unit, WisconsinWildlife: Mosquitos!This was my first trial run using the ULA Circuit backpack loaded with the rest of gear. I used this short hike to test a few recipes as well as two different hiking shoes.The Ice Age Trail is relatively flat with only slight gains in elevation when hiking up and down the moraines.Day 1: Drove to ranger station to register for open sites. Instead of doing a loop, I had to do a sort of flip flop by parking my car in the middle of the hike. After obtaining my permits (I guess the state budget was now in effect: $18 per night for lean-tos without a water source, thank you mr. guv'nor), I drove to the car campground at the midway point and began my hike at 3 pm, hiking 5 miles east to the first lean-to. I carried two quarts of water. Arrived at 5 pm. Mosquitos were fierce in the woods, but the lean-to caught a nice wind and the evening was relatively bug-free.Day 2: Filled up the water bottles 1/2 mile away at a visitor center, then headed back toward the car where I was able to switch out shoes (traded the Oboz Sawtooth to Merrill Moabs) and grabbed two more water bottles since the next shelter, six miles away, had no additional water sources. Carried a gallon of water to the shelter located west of the car, for my second night. Mosquitos continued to be a nuisance. It was very hot and humid. Used up two quarts by dinner, part of the third for cleaning off the bug repellent, sun screen and sweat and retained the fourth for the hike back to the car the next morning. Hiked 11 miles in total.Day 3: Retraced my six miles back to the car. Used the morning to test the umbrella. The ULA Circuit has elastic cording to hold water bottles on the front straps, which worked just as well for holding up the umbrella handle. Made it back to the car by 11:30 a.m.Reflections:- Happy with the gear, including figuring out a simple hands-free means of carrying the umbrella.- Had to fiddle around with the backpack straps to get it to rest better on my shoulders. Was riding too high. - Like the convenience of carrying water bottles on the front.- No blisters. Both pairs of shoes worked great.",,Ice Age Trail,"Aug 01, Sat",0
Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513934,"Dates: August 24 - 28, 2015Weather: 50s to 70s; rainy, windy to sunny and clearMiles Hiked: 42.5Place: North Country Trail through Pictured Rocks National LakeshoreWildlife: Water and woodland birds, coyote, deerThis was my second trial run. Pack weighed in around 28 pounds carrying five days worth of food, two quarts of water and my winter clothes (down jacket, long underwear, camp clothes, rain jacket, rain kilt and umbrella.) The 42.5 mile section of the North Country Trail runs between the two Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Visitor Centers in Munising and Grand Marais, Michigan. A good 11 miles or more of the trail is atop the dramatic cliffs.Day 1: I parked my car at the west end at the Munising visitor center and got a noon shuttle to the east end near Grand Marais. After dropping off two hikers at the halfway point for a shorter hike, I arrived around 1:30 p.m. Almost as soon as I grabbed my gear the rain started. Gave me the opportunity to try out the new Marmot Pre-cip rain jacket, ULA rain kilt and umbrella in heavy and intermittent rain showers while hiking for the first 7.1 miles. They worked great. Arrived at Au Sable East campsite around 5:30ish. Rained all day. Got into the low 40s overnight, but I was toasty in my down sleeping bag and silk liner. Day 2: 12.9 miles from Au Sable to Beaver Creek campground. Hiked through the lighthouse property and into forests and along the beaches and through the BeaverCreek Wilderness area where I ended up meeting my friend Joyce within five minutes of her arrival from another parking lot trailhead 3.5 miles away from the east. The day was blustery all day long with the wind blowing off the lake and funneling into the camping area. During the night, the wind began to die down.Day 3: 10 miles from Beaver Creek to Mosquito River campsite. This part of the trail follows some of the most spectacular parts of the national lakeshore including Chapel Rock. The trail gains little elevation overall, but we were hiking right along the edge of the towering bluffs plunging down to Lake Superior. Day 4: 6.9 miles from Mosquito River to Cliffs campsite. The day was sunny today and got warmer. The trail from here descends down to Miners Beach, and we even took a quick dip in Lake Superior. Stopped at the interpretative center and scenic overlook by Miner's Castle. Our campsite tonight was at Cliff, which was in the woods, well away from the water and not very special. Day 5: 5.1+ miles from Cliffs back to the Munising visitor center. We left the North Country Trail and took the Sand Point side trail that led through a sandy peninsula and looped back to the road connecting to the visitor center. The NCT mileage was 5.1, but we may have walked more taking the side trip. Back at my car by 11:30 a.m. and drove back to the trail head to retrieve Joyce's car.Reflections:- Love the rain gear. Happy. Kilt also worked well shielding the wind.- Recipe testing/food quantities all worked out well- Distances were fine. 12.9 mile day, while tiring, wasn't exhausting. Only hiked in the Merrell Moabs on this trip and no blisters.- Pictured Rocks is an awesome place to visit and a great place to hike.",,North Country Trail/Pictured Rocks ,"Aug 24, Mon",0
Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520136,"November, December and January have been spent bagging up more than 150 dinners and/or lunches. Still working on where mail drops are expected to be shipped. Each box will contain 25 + dinners which have been packed with a variety of chicken, beef, tuna and/or veggie recipes ranging from 5 minutes to 15 minutes of cooking time. I'll pick a few days and bounce the rest of the trail. In most cases, the stove will only be used for a few minutes and ""cooking"" will be completed using a pot cozy.My cook kit consists of a Snowpeak GigaPower Stove, GSI 1.1 liter pot, with cozy and GSI Foldable spoon.I am a huge fan of TrailCooking.com (for recipes), Harmony House (for harder to DIY dehydrated vegetables and beans) and Minimus (for individual oil, cheese, soy sauce and dressing packets.)You can read more about my food preparation and recipes here:http://appalachiantrials.com/the-magical-makings-of-memorable-trail-food/
I've always packed my own meals beginning in the lat 70s with my worn copy of the Sierra Club's ""Simple Foods for the Pack."" It's not that I don't know resupply is relatively easy for most parts of the AT, its because I don't want to rely on convenience stores when grocery stores are absent. You either hit a post-office or hostel or you spend the time shopping. It's a trade-off I'm willing to make. 
All of my food has been prepared in this way for every trip I've ever did, including my 740-mile long canoe trip in 2011. But hey, thanks for the anonymous advice I'm getting about what I'm doing wrong.",,View Entry,"Jan 25, Mon",0

Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522608,"There were two reasons why I found myself in Arizona at the end of February, less than 45 days from my AT departure date:1)        My parents are snowbirds, who reside south of Tucson for five months where hiking trails abound; and2)        A NOLS Wilderness Medicine Institute Wilderness First Aid (WFA) class was offered at the Tucson REI, which fit nicely into my plan of visiting my parents before heading east in April.The WFA class was jam-packed with all sorts of information and I was dead tired at the end of each day. Fortunately, my parents have settled in a retirement community that is quiet by 9 p.m. It’s just like hiker’s midnight—except everyone tucks into the cozy private bedrooms of campaign bus-sized RVs or permanent “park models” (smallish mobile homes).We were able to practice several potential wilderness medical emergencies from mountain biking through a swarm of bees to a whitewater rafting trip gone horrible wrong. I had the unfortunate luck of being hit in the head with a poorly thrown rock while attempting to hang my food bag. It was well-worth attending, however I’m not sure how useful I’d ultimately be if I was truly the first person on the scene of an accident or illness. We covered almost 20 different medical emergencies over two days. There are so many things to remember. I almost always forgot to check the patient’s airway first, even though that is the “A” in the ABC (+ DE) of surveying the patient for immediate life threats. I just hope that if anything happens to me, a WFA-trained hiker recalls the correct protocols much better than I.One of the hikes my husband and I were able to get in during our short visit was an eight-mile jaunt in the Santa Rita Mountains, part of the Coronado National Forest and Wilderness Area. Being the one in training, there was no paper-scissors-rock challenge determining who got to carry the daypack on this outing. Although half the weight of my full AT backpack, it still contained three liters of water, our lunch, and some extra clothes and emergency items. I sported my now familiar Appalachian Trail uniform of a wool shirt, Purple Rain™ hiking skirt and Icebreaker® zone shorts while hiking in Merrill Moab hiking shoes with added SuperFeet insoles. The new Dirty Girl gaiters made their first debut. And passed. Our hike began at an elevation of 5450' from the Mt. Wrightson picnic area and trailhead at the end of Madera Canyon (which incidentally is a rock star status migratory birding area). After the initial .3 mile approach trail, we switch-backed straight up 1.5 miles toward Josephine’s Saddle, a gain of more than 1600' to 7080'. I got winded. When we reached the elevation and checked the time, we realized it had taken more than 2 hours. I was shocked. Luckily, I had just learned about how to treat shock the day before, so I quickly recovered.Once we reached the ridgeline, the remaining 6.2 miles of trail, including the 3.7-mile descent, gave us no problems. We were back to the car three hours later. Overall, I was satisfied with the excursion—especially knowing that the highest point on the AT is 6,655' Clingmans Dome in Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Plus, the Santa Rita Mountains are pretty sweet in spring when you’re from Wisconsin. The trail meanders along canyons, over ridges and among trees. And feeling the sunshine again wasn’t altogether unpleasant either. In Spring 2012, we had hiked and summited Mt. Wrightson, another 2.2 miles and 2000 feet up from Josephine’s Saddle—and above tree line—at an elevation of 9,453'. My mother also summited this peak, back in 2000. When she was 62. Mom does lots of walking, but doesn’t really backpack, so this was quite the feat. I am writing this post on the flight back to Wisconsin, where the temperature is purportedly 28 degrees, the inverse of the 82 degrees we just left in Arizona. Although I can’t see myself hankering to hike the arid and often shadeless long-distance trails in Arizona, it was a great late-winter state to hit before hitting Appalachia.",,Arizona Before Appalachia,"Mar 05, Sat",0
Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527073,"The last invoice was issued, April sales taxes paid and I officially closed down my office just 24 hours prior to my departure.I attended my last yoga class, my last YMCA Group Power class and took my last fully loaded-backpack training hike. I got my hair cut, although in hindsight, probably not short enough, and I got the house cleaned.I said goodbyes and received hugs and well-wishes over coffee, during lunch, on the phone and online. My two-year granddaughter imparted some excellent goodbye cuddles.This was my last week at home before heading east to Shenandoah National Park where I will begin my AT flipflop thru-hike. We left Wisconsin during a snowstorm in search of spring. My resupply boxes and pack have been assembled and loaded for weeks now. I’ve been enviously following members from my class of 2016 hikers, NOBOs (north bound) and more recently, the first couple of fellow flipfloppers. I do expect to be crossing paths with hikers I already “know” from my FaceBook groups. We are already looking for—and looking out—for each other. When people ask me in shocked surprise why I’m hiking alone, it’s because, for the most part, I won’t. At night hikers tend to congregate in the established campsites and shelters. If fact, the trail is appearing to be way more social than I initially assumed. But we shall see. I’m ready for my first week.",,A Week of Lasts,"Apr 08, Fri",0
Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527766,"Three inches of wet heavy snow fell as we left Wisconsin. A smallish cough began to tickle my throat. We stopped in Milwaukee for a visit to see family and by evening the cough was that kind that wouldn’t stop once you started laughing—of which we were doing a lot. No big deal. Bought some cough drops, some cough syrup and continued on our road trip to my personal trail head and start of the A.T. All through the day we chased after spring, driving in and out of snow flurries and dropping temperatures. Fellow hikers from Georgia to Virginia were talking of a polar vortex and seeking shelter from hostels and hotels. All day my cough stuck around and I started feeling feverish. Great. At least S. was going to be sticking around for several days so if I couldn’t start right away or needed to see a doctor, I still has some options. We were pulling out little teardrop camper. Once we arrived in Shenandoah, the plan was to base camp and have S. drop me off and pick me up each day as I worked my way up the trail until his departure back to Wisconsin. After eating dinner in a small town in western Ohio and driving more than 600 miles, we stopped for the night at a state park about 30 miles shy of the Pennsylvania border. All we had to do was crawl into the icy bed where I hoped sleep would work its magic and I’d wake up feeling better by morning. Instead, I shivered most of the night, woke up with the same headache I had gone to sleep with and scraped frost off the windows.Not an auspicious start. I started the day with a hit of Tylenol and my chills and headache immediately improved. By the time we reached Harpers Ferry, five hours later, it was sunny, warming and looking like we might finally see spring. I was ready to leave my first resupply box and do a little sight seeing. Still coughing, but a little hacking cough isn’t going to stop me. Onward. Shenandoah National Park and the start of my flipflop. Picked up a few groceries in Front Royal, and drove another hour and a half south to Lewis Mountain Campground, Milepost 55, halfway-ish along Skyline Drive. Two solo women were camped out across the road from us. They were out for an overnight shakedown hike in preparation for a Muir Trail hike later this summer. Our first night camping in Shenandoah was still cough inducing and cold, but there was none of that cold white stuff to scrape off the windows the next morning.",,View Entry,"Apr 10, Sun",0

I headed off with a 12-pound daypack at Rockfish Gap and Milepost #105 of Shendandoah’s Skyline Drive while Sam headed over to nearby Waynesboro in search of a day of golf.Today we both found summer. But first, we had to drive 50 miles south to my A.T. start. By the time we got to my personal starting point, it was after 10:30 a.m.The first few miles out were uphill and slow. My lungs burned—more from my congestion, I think, rather than the exertion with that back of your throat/grinding your molars feeling. I startled a few deer, which, in turn, startled me.In spite of my questionable health, today was spent getting acclimated both to a pace and to AWOL’s guidebook. Go figure—those elevation profiles mean so much more in person than in theory. I also underestimated my time in the beginning. Not sure if it was because of this upper respiratory bug I’ve been fighting or that my start was mostly uphill, but it took me 3 hours to hike 4 miles. I had been texting Sam all day with updates so we could determine where and when he could meet me at the end of the day. The original plan had been 4:30, but now I was starting to think it was looking like it would be more like 6 p.m. or later. Crap.After passing two younger female solo hikers within the first few miles, I met a very friendly guy by the Bears Den Mountain communication towers. Big Wave Dave was on the last of his nine-day 107-mile SNP hike raising awareness for Mental Health wellness. He told me he had started with a 65# pack weight, was now down to 38# and had really learned a lot this past week. This was also his first truly warm day. A week ago, he camped with wind chills below zero under 75 mph wind gusts. That had to be educational.After a late lunch under the shadow of the towers, the rest of the day’s pace was much more in line with the pace I had in mind. I hiked along pine-forested ridgelines and through mountain laurel flanked gaps and for a short moment, under a crackling high-voltage power line. At one point I was passing signs of bear including scat full of shining black fur, but no sight of the real deal. My hacking cough has to be alerting any nearby wildlife. Toward the end of the day, I past a second solo male hiker near the Calf Mountain Shelter, 7 miles distant from Waynesboro, where he was headed. A few miles further, I passed a third solo young woman, heavily-burdened and silent. I wondered where she was planning to end her day. I ended mine at 5 p.m. after six hours and a total of 9.4 miles. Today’s musing: Walking through the changing shadows over the hours, I realized how much I forget what it’s like to experience a full day’s passing doing this singular activity. I’m a living sundial. The day also passes just as fast, if not faster, than any other day packed full of activities.","SNP MP#105: Rockfish Gap

Sam hiked the first four miles with me before doubling back to the car in order to meet me further up the trail. This time, we hiked four miles in under two hours. Much better. Today I noticed that there are definitely stealth camping spots on the summits where the trail levels out. Being able to physically ease into this week has the added bonus of reassuring myself that I don’t have to rely on hitting specific shelters or established campgrounds.On the other hand, I was under the impression that you could practically knosh your way along SNP. Eat dinner, hike some more, camp at a backcountry shelter, get up, hike to breakfast, etc. While there are camp stores and waysides peppered along the parkway, it’s not like you reach them daily. And the food in the camp store where we are base camped is hugely expensive. A canister of fuel was double what you’d pay at REI.But what our base camp at Lewis Mtn has really going for it are the hot showers. Really hot showers. Sure it costs four quarters for five minutes, but those are some of the best five minutes at the end of the day. And that shower warms me up in preparation for our nighttime dip into the 30s this week.My left knee is beginning to talk to me—which is disconcerting, but only going downhill. I started listening to it in the afternoon. My feet are holding up okay. Today I wore the Oboz Sawtooth shoes. Had two smallish blisters on my left foot that I attended and aren’t an issues. Not sure if it was the distance or the shoes. Each night I’ve been massaging my feet with Aveda Foot Relief moisturizing crème. Feels good, if nothing else.Met two young Canadian thru-hikers camping here on their night three of a flipflop hike. This is their first hiking experience for these two women and their spirits were high in spite of the temps at night dipping so low. Trail highlight: Blackrock Summit at the end of the day. Just about a 360-degree walk around the summit of fractured boulders with views of the valley below.Musings: Following AWOL’s elevation changes in my guidebook is completely reminiscent of reading shoreline topography features on Fisher canoe maps.

During one of the times Sam and I were both (coincidentally) awake, he said: “That’s it, tomorrow, we are going to the doctor!” But I really thought my coughing was less deep. Instead I assumed the cold was triggering the spells. If this thing is still around, I have one more day to see a doctor while Sam is still here with the car.I stayed in the trailer for a while this morning to catch up on some reading and writing, then we headed back to the trail to pick up where I had left off. The first four miles to Loft Mountain had the least dramatic changes in elevation to date, but my knee was still talking to me on the descents. WTF? The twinge is on an outside ligament. I passed two young men wearing shiny blue basketball shorts and sweatshirt hoodies carrying full packs that I’d describe as “ambling.” They were pretty chill. I next passed a bunch of bear evidence. Scat was everywhere including a fresher looking splat. I had still been coughing. A lot. My job to announce my presence apparently was working. Except for a few squirrels, nary a wildlife sighting. By now, however, my cough was starting to bother me. During the first two days of hiking, the coughing was mostly kept at bay or I just didn’t notice it as much. Today I was concentrating much more on trying not to cough so freaking hard. For those of you familiar with the ping pong scene from the movie “Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,” let’s just say the strength of these stupid coughing spells would likely exact the same velocity. (Apologies to those of you who do know this movie and now have that visual burned into the back of your eyelids.)So I texted Sam about revising our pick-up place. Since the nighttime temperatures are again being predicted to in the 30s, maybe heading into a nearby town to see a doctor today and getting the chance to eat dinner without gloves on might be a good idea. Plus, let’s see what is going on with this knee.Soon after we confirmed our new pick-up point, Debby met up with me on the trail. Debby is a local Trail Angel and has spent a few days shuttling a blind woman hiking the trail with her service dog and using apps for navigation. Like I, she is heading north as a FlipFlopper, but at this point is a few days behind me. Debby and I walked together for the last few miles, crossing over sandy Ivy Creek, with it’s huge tumbled erratic boulders and little pools, past a rock cairn where the trail bends away from the Rockytop Overlook to Ivy Creek Overlook. I kept pace fine with Debby, uphill. But downhill—my knee was now yelling at me. This is not good. It is also a good reminder that I need to hike at my pace so I don’t hurt myself prematurely. We were soon at the overlook where Sam was waiting, and I am thinking about how I’ll have to best work out hiking with other hikers. It is easy to be sharing a conversation and not wanting it to stop even if your body is telling you otherwise. Debby agreed I sounded pretty bad and also had a pretty good idea of which town we’d need to hit for medical services. The rangers told Sam the same thing—Harrisonburg—about 30 miles distant. Off we went to the ER. No less than eight different people, including the custodian who was making rounds emptying the trash bins, saw me. Even though the receptionist told me I could only be seen in the ER for one thing at a time (?!), the ER doc was kind enough to examine my knee. After manipulating the joint, he didn’t find anything amiss (and nothing hurt while he was bending it into all sorts of yoga moves.) He thinks it is just balking at being made to hike so much.One chest x-ray, an inhaler and a new prescription for Doxycycline later (my full Lyme disease back-up prescription is sitting in my bounce box in Harper’s Ferry), plus a “free” ace bandage for my knee, and one big bowl of Pho at a nearby Vietnamese restaurant and I’m good to go. Musings: Hiking with another person makes the miles fly by, but I didn’t notice my surroundings nearly as much while we were talking. Also, antibiotics are little miracle workers.","SNP MP#84: Jones Run

Passed a few section hikers and another Flip Flopper, who had started in Harper's Ferry heading south. Just past the Simmons Gap Ranger Station, I saw my first bear. It heard me first and went crashing uphill away from me. This was thrilling and a theoretically a great direction for it to have taken. Until. The trail switched back. I had passed a group of three hikers only 5 minutes earlier and I had waited for them to catch back up to both tell them about the bear and to hike with other people for a bit. Now I’m at the top of the hill after several switchbacks. Sure enough, another crash and the same yearling peels away at up trail of me. Meanwhile, Sam is chatting it up with all sorts of Northbounders that he’s passed heading back to the car. Tenderfoot, Christmas Tree, Bananas and Dirt.

Sam drove me back to yesterday’s ending place at Powell Gap where we embraced like the two contagious platonic friends we had been acting like all week with this bronchial infection. Unfortunately as Sam started to bend around to bear hug me, I was kicking the car door shut resulting in a memorable bang to his head. He won’tbe forgetting about me anytime soon.   Was on the trail at 9:25 and did think it would be nice to make it to Lweis Mtn Campground again, knowing I might keep my daily shower routine intact. At 6 p.m. On a Friday night, during free national park weekend, I made it. I learned that Lweis Mtn Campground had been the designated negro campground when Shenandoah National Park was founded. It's located about 10 miles south of Big Meadows Campground, a huge one, and tomorrow's destination where I'm slated to meet my friend Laurie, and her family.  My knee started acting up again, so I downed two Aleve. At first they didn't seem as effective as Vitamin I, but I did make it through the day. Walking a few hundred yards to the shower later that night was another issue.

Why yes please. Even with the fuel, I still felt like I was dragging all morning. Lots of people were out on this first warm spring weekend. I met 2004 NOBO and SOBO “Allegeny” and a wonderful spry Snow Owl (she was old—er), Lone Rose and “Undecided” all heading south in sections. Dragged myself up Bearfence Mtn and just after passing the parking area,I glance up and see a black thing not four or five car lengths in front of me. Now most times, it's usually an odd shadow or charred stump. This time it was a bear. Just sitting and chilling. The trail crossed in front of it. I made noise, but nothing. I started moving. Nothing. So I kept moving. The thing just sat and watched me pass by. I kept looking back, but nothing. The afternoon was getting really warm and in spite of reapplying sunscreen, my hands were getting really burned. I later realized there was a direct correlation between the anti-biotics I’m taking and sun exposure. Laurie and I had been texting all afternoon and I met up with her, her daughter Meagan and boyfriend Jacob a little after 4 at the visitor center. We headed on to Skyland were I’ve now enjoyed another shower and bed.","SNP: Lewis Mountain Campground

I’m over the uncontrollable coughing hump. Laurie had me up earlier and we were on the trail by 8 a.m. Another beautiful day. With Laurie’s family shuttling my heavy stuff and good conversations on the trail with Laurie, the miles flew by. If we hadn’t stopped to spend time enjoying the vistas more, we might have made it back to Skyland by noon!We passed lots of people out on an overnight trip or day hiking including one couple who cautioned us to be on the lookout for any solitary hikers without gear. Apparently there was as search and rescue (or recovery) in progress. The height of the overlooks and the beauty of the park draws people for another reason. While we stopped for lunch, a helicopter passed overhead several times. It makes you look at approaching hikers a little differently. Are they carrying water? Did they sound cheerful when you said “Hello! How are you?”We were back at the lodge soon after 1 p.m. And we're ready to hike longer. I had decided it would be nice to stay one more night here, originally thinking 8 miles would have been enough. Plus it would give me a chance to reorganize for my upcoming truly camping only days. Yeah, so don't judge me…if you are keeping score that would now be 7/8 nights of comfy accommodations and 8 nights of showers. Laurie and I were able to text Jacob and Megan about picking us up a bit further down the trail, at an overlook/parking area. This made our hike almost a full 10 miles. Laurie was keen to know my pace and her duration as we are planning on meeting up again in July—closer to her home (and in between her other exotic travels).I should mention that Laurie is a 2015 Northern Forest Canoe Trail thru-paddler, the first woman to have successfully travelled the entire 740-mile trail completed under her own power. No shuttles, no miles skipped. She and I “met” via Facebook when she paddled the second half of the trail in Maine, the same year I paddled the trail. She is one of my fantastic NFCT peeps and was here in Virginia visiting her daughter in Richmond. By sheer coincidence, our schedules overlapped perfectly this weekend. Another coincidence? Megan and Jacob had met while attending school in Harrisonburg and knew exactly which Vietnamese restaurant Sam and I had enjoyed our Pho after my visit to the ER earlier last week.","SNP: Big Meadows Visitor Center

Even though I hiked a total of 10.8 miles, only 9 were new. My sun sensitivity continues so I pulled out the umbrella in order to take off my long sleeve shirt after my mid morning break. Met two section hikers heading south who also carried umbrellas. By afternoon I was really happy to have it. The summit at Mary’s Rock was beastly as was the 1.7-mile, 1200’ descent to Thorton Gap. The heat also seems to have brought out the bugs. Nothing requiring repellent, but they are around. I met Rosy Eagle, a SOBO hiker from Rhinelander, Wisconsin early in the day. He started last year and was back to finish this year. He’s Eagle because he notices everything and Rosy because his wife says he views everything about his thru-hike that way.Passed several couples coming up the switch backed trail to Mary’s Rock ostensibly on a “moderate 4 hour round trip hike”, who clearly could be in for a surprise. One young woman was already hunkered down refusing to either go up or angry that she still had a ways to go down. Later at the hut, we talked about other people heading up with less than an hour of daylight.I was the first one at the shelter around 4:30, joined by Simon from the UK out for a four day hike, and at dusk, NOBOs Crash and Hoboken arrived after a 20 mile day. Musings: Many parts of the AT skirt Skyland Drive. From Stony Man, the trail is just below the overlook, like a secret path the motorists will never know about, or like a second-class citizen’s path not unlike the servant’s passages on Downton Abbey.","Skyland Lodge/SNP:MP #38.5: Stony Man Overlook

Heard more about the fire today—sections are closed and hikers will need to be rerouted. Rangers confirmed that some sections will be allowed to burn. The missing woman is still missing and my hut mate tonight said he heard there was a suicide note. Still rumors at this point. The hazy skies were a relief today for my skin, being the delicate flower that I am. The back of my legs are as red and blistered as my hands and they are tougher to protect. All I have for pants are black wool long johns and weren't a great option in yesterday’s heat. Stopped at the Elkwallow Wayside at noon today after banging out the first seven miles. En route I met Mike, then “Dorothy” (of the red shoes), both having started flip flops from Harpers Ferry heading south. Oh, Dorothy…I wish you had been heading north! I enjoyed our 5 minute conversation in passing and me thinks we would have had fun together. Thus far I’ve encountered only one other north bound Flip Flopper, “Turtle” back near Big Meadows. He was mightily burdened and as his name suggests, I don’t expect to see him anytime soon.Mike and Dorothy have helped solidify my trail name to “Hacknee.” Arachne requires a complicated explanation and Sam pointed out how my name could easily evolve based on my first few days of hacking bronchitis and my hurt knee. As fellow flipfloppers they listened to my story and provided the feedback I needed.During my lunch break, I charged up my phone (see you do look for outlets almost more than you do for your next water source), ate the last of my 4-day old pepperoni, and wrote some journal entries on my iPad. Once at the summit near Matthew’s Arm Campground, I was able to get a signal and give Sam an update about the fire and me not being the missing woman.The last few miles to the shelter were downhill and full of interesting trail side rustlings. I noticed the sound of raindrops falling when the sky suggested otherwise. I stopped. The raindrops stopped. I walked and the pitter pattering continued. Stopped again and realized there were thousands of tiny grasshoppers in the leaf litter and I as I passed them, it triggered movement. This continued for some distance—a wave of raindrop sounding grasshopper hoppings. Just before reaching the hut, I noticed a barred owl sitting not 20 feet away. Only when my phone camera making that stupid camera click sound, did it fly off.This morning I looked in vain for the phone preference to silence the “shutter.”J. from Washington, D.C. was already in residence when I arrived and the cocktail hour begun. I guess vodka doesn’t weigh that much. I waited to see if anyone else showed up, plus wanted to gauge what this alcohol-packing hiker was all about, so I started off making dinner first before committing to staying in the shelter. J. also had a charger and wanted to know if it was okay to listen to NPR or some podcasts. Okay, he’s sounding safer... So we ate our dinners listening to an episode of This American Life. In the woods. In the middle of almost nowhere. J. made an over-the-top fire, explaining he had to, being an Eagle Scout and all. We're ad the hut journal warning of a resident skunk, talked gear, travel and some politics. Right at dusk, another hiker showed up and set up his hammock nearby. I unrolled my sleeping bag and decided I probably wouldn't be murdered in my sleep by an NPR vodka-imbibing Eagle Scout.Musings: Apparently one can immediately gain my trust simply by being an NPR listener.","Pass Mtn Shelter

Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529020,"And now a message about my day.Beside starting out with bronchitis, the only aches and pains I’ve experienced thus far have been that outside left knee IT band (?) issue and some minor blisters and pinky toe hot spots. The knee pain was disconcerting as it appeared at the end of day two and I was hobbling on the downhill stretches real,y slowly. The ER Doctor had examined it while I was getting checked for bronchitis and didn't find any problem, so that was a relief. I took ibuprofen or Aleve for a few consecutive mornings and the pain is now gone. Despite my shoes being really broken in (enough so that they are even beginning to fall apart), I developed a two blisters, also on my left, on the outside pad near my big toe. I used moleskin on them, and one has since disappeared and the other is calloused. Both of my pinky toes are “hot” and sore by the end of each day, but I think that’s a structural thing for me. They sort of go numb during the day and they remained blister-free. The sun has been my enemy, though, as antibiotics make my skin sensitive to sunlight. Both the back of my legs and my hands are blistered. I’ve been hiking in my black wool gloves and yesterday, left my black wool tights on as long as possible before switching to my high gaiters. Only another day or two and I'll be done with those meds. I have no calf, hamstring, quad or back pain to which I think I can thank my Y, yoga and circuit classes. I try to remember to stretch each day, but I tend to forget since my muscles feel pretty good thus far. Even my tight right hip that has prevented me from getting to deep in the triangle pose is non-existent. I haven’t slept soundly yet-between the first week of bronchitis, getting re-used to sleeping within the confines of a sleeping bag or sharing spaces with big time snorers.My day begins by running my fingers through my hair, splashing some water on my face and packing up the bag and tent if it is being used. I'll heat water for coffee and maybe some oatmeal, otherwise it's dried fruit or protein bars. I’ve started hiking 5-8 miles before lunch. I’ll eat my snacks as I’m hiking or take a few short breaks. The past few days I taken longer lunch breaks, stopping to write and taking my shoes off so my feet can air out. Then it's another 5-8 miles before stopping at shelter (where there are places to hang or store your food), a privie, and camp spots or a mouse-inhabited shelter. Or I shoot for a hostel, like the place I’m taking at tonight and will be in two more days again as I approach Harper's Ferry. During the day, I’m hiking alone and passing people along the trail and at night I’m hanging out with hikers heading in both directions or just out for a few nights. My day's end with a big dinner, maybe a little wash down using the bandana and an Aveda peppermint foot relief massage. Incredibly, the days fly by much fasrer than you could ever imagine.","Gravel Springs Hut

This is supposed to be a good one. J. also told me about a hostel right along the trail at the Front Royal highway crossing. It was pretty cold this morning. I left my long underwear on and my gloves were needed to keep my fingers warm instead of protected from the sun. Took a second breakfast break on one of the last peaks before beginning my descent out of Shenandoah. At one point I rounded a small summit with stones thrusting upwards, a common sight along this section of the greenstone (?) ridge line trail. A narrow passage ran between two rock formations with a bent tree overhanging and all I could think of was “you must not pass!” from “Lord of the Rings.” But pass I did. In fact, I passed my 100 mile mark today, somewhere around Compton Springs, near the park’s milepost number 11. The last remaining miles out of the national park where very level and almost graded, but you could tell when you crossed the park boundary. The trail changed to a goat path as you picked your way down and around a rocky drop-off, then switch backed to the footpath below. I hiked 10 miles to the Tom Floyd Shelter before stopping for lunch at 1:30. I put on my tall black gaiters to protect my blistered calfs from the now hot (again) sun. The descent to Front Royal was more than 1000’ and I started thinking about those extra miles heading back up before reaching the nice shelter.That hostel was starting to sound better.I met two section hikers near a stream crossing and asked them about the water situation heading toward the shelter. My lunch break’s stream was low. With no rain and little snow this winter, the water sources have been running drier. We all decided to get some water out of this deeper stream. “Jackrabbit” suddenly jumped as he almost stepped on the nearby 6’ foot bull snake. It was huge, but didn't seem to mind us. It never moved the entire time we gathered water. The guys also confirmed the hike to the shelter was mostly uphill. Hiked another mile or so and reached the highway to Front Royal around 5 p.m., where a hostel sign indicated both the amenities and the directions. I followed. Showers, a bed, breakfast. Met Bearfoot, who was allowing his ”Captain Crunch” knee to recover a few days while his friend hiked between Bears Den Hostel (my next destination) and Front Royal. Bearfoot thru-hiked a few years ago and helps edit AWOL’s guidebook. It was a nice opportunity to have the chance to meet him and talk guidebooks and trail talk. The Mountain Home B&B was perfect for me. The owners, Scott (Scott thru-hiked in 2012)and Lisa, are in the process of renovating an 1800’s house that will offer a few traditional B&B rooms, a bunk house and hiker amenities (showers and laundry facilities). For now, four beds are offered in the upstairs of the adjacent two-story brick former slaves’ quarters with the owners sharing the space living downstairs. Very, very good call to stop here for the day, although I didn't realize until I went to take my shower that I had worn my shirt inside out all day.","SNP: Gravel Springs Hut

Instead, I walked the highway again for that ¼ mile. Did get to see a family of raccoons, although they were all roadkill. The ascent to the Denton Shelter would have been challenging at the end of the day yesterday, but staying there would have been worth it. Best. Shelter. Ever. Like a little hiker compound.Today’s travels took me past a sign demarcating the western front of the southern confederacy during the civil war. I walk along and over old stone walls that make me wonder who put all the effort in defining these mountain parcels now being reclaimed by the encroaching forests. Advancing civil war armies? Slaves? Children? I had a nice chat with four older men out day hiking including “Skiman” a former thru-hiker. Decided to push on to Dick’s Dome Shelter, making this my longest day yet at over 15 miles. Dick’s Dome is a four-person geodesic dome adjacent to a babbling brook. In places you can hear the water flowing under the stones. I’m staying with two NOBOs tonight, both of whom just did a 28-mile day from Gravel Springs Hut, which the astute reader may recall was my abode two nights ago. The last few miles of the trail was very smooth, but at the end of the day all you think about (at least for me) is how fast I can go to get to the shelter marking the end of my day. The bottoms of my feet are the sorest and I actually think about them when I first lay down for the night. My feet are wondering what I'm doing to them and they are not pleased. Ryno had phone reception and we learned that Prince died. In 2011, I was on a canoe trip when we learned that Amy Winehouse had died. Not that either of these culturally icons directly impacted me, but it's interesting to be out of the loop. We also learned that the woman missing in Shenandoah was found. A suicide. There is some chatter about a potential fire ahead on the trail showing up in our Facebook group feeds.Now this we do want to be kept in the loop about.Dinner tonight was a taco noodle bowl. Another keeper. Musings: I have a completely different mindset about pace and bears in the late afternoon vs morning. In the morning, I take notes, look around and sort of keep an eye open for wildlife. But the end of the day, if I were to see a bear I’m already thinking how I'd blast by it because nothing is going to stop me from reaching my shelter."," Mountain House B&B

I was able to move across the sky grabbing onto building peaks like one does. When they are dreaming. Maybe it's my subconscious thinking I should be moving faster and doesn't know what to do with these elongated days spent concentrating on just walking. Light showers started just as I left camp this morning. Put on the pack cover and took out the umbrella. I’m swearing by umbrella use. I stayed dry and was a normal hot from hiking not from wearing a rain jacket. The trees are now greening for real and trilliums, moonflowers and may apples (?) carpet the forest floor. Hiking through Big Meadows State Park was pleasant and it was there where I startled two deer and later was startled by a bolting bunny. The signage indicating trail directions and distances to places like the Bear Den Hostel, my destination for Saturday, in this park rocked. Stopped for lunch after 9 miles at the Rod Hollow Shelter to get out of the rain, change into dry socks and write. During the hour I spent there, the rain stopped. Next up: The roller coaster. Even though I “only” had 6.9 miles to go in order to reach the next shelter, those miles are part of 13.5 miles of continuous ascents and descents, hence the “roller coaster.” I left Rod Hollow Shelter at 2:30 and it took me 4.5 hours to get “home” tonight. Today’s hike had me cross a four-lane divided highway and past the smoldering ashes of a small forest fire. So yeah, yesterday's alert was correct in one sense…there was a fire, but it wasn't where I expected to find it and it was small. I met two weekenders at the top of the second roller coaster hill where the fire had been and apparently had just missed the firefighters. The guys also told me that storms were expected around 10 p.m., so I was really hoping to get in the shelter tonight. The first hill of the roller coaster was pretty. The morning rain was evaporating. Sun-dappled trees and filtered light. Trilliums. Birds singing. The pine-needle strewn trail meandered for a bit at the top of the hill amidst a jungle of lichen-encrusted boulders. Then it went down to a babbling brook, where the next hill started heading right back up again. The second hill held the novelty of that little fire. After that, I just wanted to get to my camp destination. Yes there were pretty little streams in the gaps between each hill, but then there was another freaking hill. II stopped noticing much of anything, well except for a few big yellow and black striped centipede-like critters I attempted not to crush. The Sam Moore shelter is in a lovely location.. I like it better than the Rod Hollow and happy I pushed on. It's a three sided log-cabin facing a spring. The water is flowing enough for me to be able to take a bottle bath adjacent to the stream and out of sight from everyone. Even the outhouse is nicer than the one at Dick’s Dome. And best of all, fellow Appalachian Trials Turbo Trooper, Victoria, is here. My first night with both another solo female and a Facebook Group friend. She started five days after I did, but had to leave the trail because her dog was having problems with her saddlebags. “Mountain Man” has a German shepherd “Pepper” with him and Victoria got some dog love. The guys had a cheery fire grouping as I arrived and had set up tents in the adjacent sites. We all hung out around the campfire until the rain started falling. Glad there was room at this Inn tonight. Musings: I’m not having too many problems going uphill although I do take quite a few stops from time to time. I find myself thinking of it as reversed skiing (when I’m not trying to avoid stepping on colorful centipedes. Or salamanders. Sometimes I plant both trekking poles like I’m going for more speed (still propulsion, just not in the same gravitational pull)   and other times I’m alternating them like I’m cross-country skiing.","Dick's Dome Shelter near Sky Meadow State Park

And I hope I’m not playing with fire with self-diagnosing.My cough was definitely gone the last few days, so this sucks if it is reoccurring.

Biscuit is heading out after me with plans to reach Harpers Ferry, 20 miles from here. Everyone else is gone. About two miles into my hike, after passing about 20 scouts and the same number of hiking club hikers, Biscuit flies by me heading up a hill.

Hmmmm, maybe I could make it to Harper's Ferry today too. But, first, let’s concentrate on stopping for lunch at the ATC Blackburn Trail Center. That’s only .25 miles off trail. All downhill. I needed to get water and the center seemed like a nice destination, which it was, but sort of a distance just for lunch. I headed back up the hill back to the trail. Arrived at the David Lesser Memorial Shelter around 3:30 p.m. I could see an inviting deck from the trail…and If I wanted to camp at the next campsite another 4 or 5 miles further, I’d again need water. So, let's take a looksie. Oooh, nice patio swing, nice Adirondack bench, nice privy view. I sign the shelter journal saying it was nice, but too early to stop. Then head to the spring .25 miles downhill. Again. By the time that’s done (nice spring by the way), it's now 4:15. Oh, what the heck! I’m heading to Harper's Ferry to stay tomorrow regardless, so why not stay here? I spent the next hour and a half reading a book in the swing thinking I’d have the place to myself.

Another flipflopper showed up way after dark. Musings: I had quite a theological discussion going on inside my head today about the definition of Lord vs God.

After Benjamin made the hostel guests waffles for breakfast,, I hooked onto a ride with A-Tex heading out to catch a 6:45 train. Met up with Nera, who had been staying at a hotel, at the bridge and we we were on our way by 7 a.m. Thunderstorms and severe weather had been predicted to arrive mid to late afternoon. The two-story, Swiss chalet-like Ed Garvey Shelter is 5.6 miles south of Harper Ferry. It is the first of several bigger shelters constructed of logs and with fire pits and seating. We stopped there for a snack, where we met three young men hanging out at the shelter, Pyroeis, who got his fabulous trail name due to an unfortunate incident with an alcohol stove and Heet, and who was waiting out the predicted storms and two other guys who looked like they just got up after playing video games all night in a friend’s basement.

This was both a new distance and speed record for me. Our shelter included two pipe-smoking men, MuffPower and Squeezebox, from Indiana. The longtime friends had left their families at home while they were out for a weeklong sampling of the AT. One of them had a muscle strain and had taken a zero there. Nera and I took over the top level of the newer two-story shelter and spent a relaxing evening cooking our dinners, writing and reading. As of bedtime, the storms had yet to materialize. Musings: All of today's musings were talked out loud.","Harpers Ferry, WV

And pileated woodpeckers? I saw many of both. The storms finally hit around 5 a.m., but they were more heavy showers vs. severe weather. Nera and I started out together, ahead of the Indiana guys, and as the rain continued to fall, but they caught up to us each time we took a break—at the Dalgren Backpackers Campground, at the Washington Memorial/State Park and finally at the Pine Knoll Shelter, where we had stopped for lunch, but where they were going to stay. We past more stone walls and Revolutionary War historical sites. Nera wasn't planning on doing another 15 mile day today, but the first two campsite options were under 11 miles. The next shelter was another 5 miles away. The rain turned into a mist, then just heavy fog. It was sort of fun walking through the forests like this. At one point, I stopped to take off my rain jacket--and lost Nera. I think she took the .25 mile turnoff to the first campsite, one that supposedly offered stunning views of the Annapolis Rocks presumably when fog is absent, but I kept on walking deciding that hiking would keep me warmer that setting up camp in the early afternoon drizzle. But, oh boy, where those last five miles tough ones. There was a reason there were no other roads or other camping opportunities. Just miles of jumbled rocks and boulder fields. I left Nera a “100” message spelled out in rocks somewhere along the path for her to find tomorrow, marking her first hundred miles. Postal Poet arrived at the shelter tonight after I did, and he saw it, so I hope she does too. Tonight’s shelter has quite the cast of characters. Three of them started in Harper's Ferry almost a week ago and are only traveling shelter to shelter. That means tomorrow's distance is only 4.9 miles. They all have heavy packs. Traveling Tom plays the recorder hand has a voice and storytelling sense exactly like the late folk icon Utah Phillips.Musings: There are some hikers who attempt to hike either all of the 40-mile Maryland trail segment, or even adding in the 8-mile section of West Virginia in order to say they hiked four states (Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania) in one day. But I’m in awe of anyone including the AT speed record holders, Jennifer Pharr Davis, Scot Jurek and Heather “Anish” Anderson, that are able to make it quickly through those boulder fields.","Rocky Run Shelter, MD

Around noon, I too, thought that was an excellent idea, but instead I find myself typing on my iPad with cold fingers, alone in a even colder shelter. I think the tent would be warmer, but I don't relish the idea of packing up a frosty wet one in the morning. Today was tough due to cold, rain and more rocks. I started off hiking in the rain which turned into a drizzle. Stopped at the newer Raven Rock Shelter for a snack and where most of my shelter mates were headed for the night. It was amazingly cold. At one point I thought I saw snow. This, just two days after I was worried about my hands getting burned. The upside of all this cold and rain is that my antibiotic sun-sensitive skin is completely covered. I started fantasizing about taking a hot bath-possibly if only I hitch a ride into Waynesboro like Postal Poet is doing. I can get out of this rain and cold. But that would only be 9 miles and I want to keep up a 15-mile average, which only has just started. Plus, today I will pass my 200 mile mark. The best way to keep warm is to just keep hiking. A few miles after the shelter, I etched “200” into the wet dirt and took a photo while I still had battery power left on the phone. Then, over the jumbled boulders I descended. At one point, you picked your way around or scuttled over monstrous rocks primarily directed by following little red flags, the kind the gas company marks whenever you do any landscaping for digging. I was warm after that.Actually, the rain stopped and this side of the mountain did feel warmer. And is that the sun trying to burn through this fog? Okay, maybe I don't need to whimp out and head to a hotel. Besides, I'm slated to hit a hostel tomorrow night for a resupply and potential zero day. Carry on and beyond Maryland. The rocky jungle gym trail morphs into an old civil war road (of course) that takes the trail through Pen-Mar State Park. A new state, Pennsylvania, is demarcated by the Mason-Dixon Line (as noted by the conveniently placed sign, thank you very much.) Now I know where that line is--and it's far more north than I thought. After 17 days, I experienced my first true trail magic late this afternoon. A bag of apples and sodas were cooling in the creek by a footbridge just before crossing Route 16 (wherever that may lead). The apple was de-li-cious and did motivate me over the next few miles. I like you Pennsylvania!But now here I sit, in the middle of the woods with the trees dripping and my fingers numbing. . At least I won't be disturbed by any of that freight train snoring like I have been at just about every other shelter I've stayed at. Although, a whippoorwill just started calling and I know of at least a few people who will worry about my ability to sleep if that thing goes on calling all night. Now let's see how warm this 20-degree rated sleeping bag keeps me. Musings: Walking in fog is fun, until it gets cold. Londoners are brilliant to drink hot tea all the time.","Ensign Cowald Shelter, MD

There are a few reasons (besides the obvious snorers, that point in time the ladies of my age find ourselves and of course the lack of my bed buddy of 32 years) that prevent me from soundly sleeping. One: I’m stiff. The soles of my feet still tighten up at night; not in a Charlie horse way, but they still say things like “stretch me!” or “what the heck are you doing to us?” My hips will also tell me to roll over and when they do, I wake up. Second: I’m attempting to rest fitfully each night confined within a burrito. I’m a side sleeper and it's not unusual to have Sam roll over and find my knee near his face. A mummy sleeping bag doesn't provide that same kind of, shall we say, mobility. Many hikers have been switching from sleeping bags to sleeping quilts. Nera has one and showed me how she sleeps right on her Therm-o-rest (air mattress) and the quilt is on top of her. The theory is that you get little to no insulation factor when the bag is compressed under you. I’m not sure if Nera actually sleeps right on the mattress, which strikes me as being potentially hot and sticky in summer, or as recently as ONLY TWO NIGHTS AGO, but last night I thought I give it a try repurposing my mummy bag. I took the equally restrictive, but added warmth of the silk liner I’ve been carrying and inserted my air mattress in it, creating a sheet. I unzipped my bag fully and inserted the mattress into the box toe, allowing the bag to now form a top quilt and my legs to move much more freely. Even though I could see my breath, I do think the bag kept me as warm as if it had been all zipped up. Unfortunately, my hips kept waking me up. After several cups of hot protein broth and coffee, I was ready to find that hostel. I’m liking Pennsylvania thus far. Besides yesterday's trail magic, the forests in this first section are coniferous: red and white pines, spruce, balsam. The next two shelters I passed today were in pretty locations adjacent to clear running brooks. I'm also fairly certain they would have been just as cold last night. Tumbling Run Shelters in particular were gems. A caretaker visits the location often and it was spotless. Two shelters designated “snoring” and “non snoring,” clotheslines, landscaping and stone stairways leading to the covered picnic table and a clean privy complete with toilet paper and hand sanitizer. Five stars! Alas, I only stopped for a snack and privy visit. Next was the 1.3 mile climb to Chimney Rocks, up into a cloud. Without wind, the occasional bird songs were muffled. It was so peaceful, and as yet, not too cold, that I even took the extra .2 mile blue blaze trail to the overlook even though I couldn't see anything.The trail then descended into more pine forests, over more rocks, into colder drizzle and finally to U.S. 30. I thought the hostel was a bit closer than it turned out to be, but it was still under a mile—only that I walked against some seriously fast oncoming traffic. I can get a ride back to the trail head when I return. Laundry is done, dinner was served to me and my phone is again recharged. Tomorrow I am taking my first true zero. Maybe I can figure out a faster way to upload a few more photos. No blisters. No knee pain. My cough might finally be gone. All is well.","Deer Lick Shelter, PA

But I had got a lot done yesterday and Sunday’s forecast is 100% precipitation and two of yesterday's hikers had done this same trip and found it enjoyable and the shuttle wasn't leaving until 10 a.m., so….I got 11 pretty easy miles in today. Step and a Half and I chatted the whole time, and like my day hiking with Nera, the miles really flew by. Today’s hike started out in another cloud, but soon descended into more pine forests and rhododendron tunnels. We passed two shelters, both immaculately maintained, but a special shoutout must be made to the Quarry Gap Shelters—two side by side log structures with a connecting skylight roof, potted plants and tent platforms. We had the pleasure of being able to meet the caretaker as he was coming up for his weekend maintenance. I’ve been curious if these exceptional shelters include personal investments or if the local clubs decide which shelters are targets to receive additional amenities. Turns out to be mostly personal and a matter of pride coupled with a wee bit of competition between some of the caretakers. For example, Quarry Gap Shelters will soon be receiving a porch swing like the one I had seen at the David Lesser Memorial Shelter a few nights ago. And no, I didn't take any photos. Google it.Was back at the hostel by 3:45. Another delicious dinner served by this church, a trip to town to buy some groceries to replace the food resupply that never showed up, and another day in the book. Side note: Postal Poet told us he was hoping to see Atlas soon and he showed up at the hostel tonight. Introductions were made over dinner and I was explaining about my original trail name, Arachne, which “Atlas” totally got. I may go back to that as “Hacknee” still sounds like cat trying to cough up a hairball—a colorful description of my first two weeks, to be sure, but not a very poetic one. either.","Trail of Hope Hostel, Fayetteville, PA

Those who know me, know that I’m a Unitarian via Methodist. Gary is a Catholic. This service was neither, and I expected no less. Ultimately not either of our styles, but a warm congregation and sincerely good people. Gary and I were shuttled up to Shippensburg Road where he headed south to slack pack the same section I did yesterday and I resumed my hike north toward Pine Grove Furnace State Park, the location of the half gallon ice-cream challenge and Ironmaster Hostel. The trail was relatively flat and I passed two halfway demarcation signs, the current one for 2016 that moves every year based upon changes made to the trail like a section reroute, and a permanent one that a fellow made for the trail several years ago. Alas, even though I doubt not my ability, and even with all my smack talk, of eating a half gallon of ice cream at this historic location, it was just not to be. After hiking all day in a cloud and arriving in a cold drizzle around 4:30, I just wasn't feeling like ice cream. Plus, although this is about the halfway point for NOBO hikers, it wasn't my halfway point. However I highly recommend the Hawaiian Burger, which I devoured instead at the general store. It was at the Pine Grove General Store where I met Giggles, a woman I had heard about from another Facebook Group hiker-and who coincidentally also knows Nera. Ordinarily I'd be inclined to say “what a small world!” except that my world is limited to a singular line and Facebook that all of us are following. Soon after, Rambler and Padre arrive. I first met this daughter and father team at the Teahorse Hostel in Harper's Ferry where they started. Dad is spending three weeks hiking with his daughter before he leaves and she continues on to Katahdin. They are cruising. All of us were headed to the Ironmaster Hostel which didn't open until 5 p.m. For $5 more, dinner was included, so yeah…dinner number two was ready at 7 p.m. after showers and device charging. This hostel is in a lovely old building—more like an historic B&B, except we are all in bunk beds and rooms separated by sex. I should sleep well tonight.","Shippensburg Road, Fayetteville, PA

Adds to my overall high rating for this hostel in general. Good beds, no snorers. Maybe due to the latter reasons. Rambler’s dad “Padre” has major blister issues. Over breakfast this morning, it was decided that he’d seek medical attention-and perhaps new shoes-and take a zero day in town while Rambler, Giggles and I hiked together today and are staying in the same shelter tonight. Giggles has just completed a week of 20+ mile days and decided she might “slow down” in order to hike with those of us who don't already have over 700 hundred miles under their shoes. Rambler will be meeting up with Padre tomorrow in the next town. So, for the first time since I met Nera (now a few days behind me), I am hiking with two delightful (and energetic) 20-something women and who just explained to me why my iPad music hasn't downloaded my iTunes library even though I have the music on all my other devices. Anyway, the day flew by with Giggles doing most of the flying and Rambler and I talking about Downtown Abbey, Call the Midwife, Outlander, Breaking Bad, Dr. Who and Lord of the Rings. The trail meandered over hills and we crossed several paved highways and unpaved roads. One of the highlights today was scrambling over and squeezing through two rock “mazes.” These are giant boulders where apparently prankster trail planners found it humorous to make us thread our way through them (vs. say, oh I don't know, skirt them?) There were places where the rocks were marked with arrows. Giggles was a little behind Rambler and I at this point and said she had seen a rattler among one of the rocks. Kind of forgot about snakes. As we were approaching the shelter, we scared up a large herd of deer. We were momentarily surprised ourselves earlier today when turkey hunters emerged from the woods. The first one appeared soon after we started, but the second group, a father and son, showed up by the shelter off trail while Rambler and I were eating lunch. They weren't as disconcerting, however, as the hiker still in the shelter who hadn't packed and left as of noon, but told us he was heading Georgia. Great! That’s not our current direction-so go for it!A fourth hiker joined us here at the shelter around dinnertime, “Stick.” He has decided to hang his hammock rather than join three ladies of the shelter and take his chances against storms that are now predicted for tonight. He’s originally from Melbourne, Australia and is heading south having already finished Katahdin to Delaware Water Gap several years ago. He’ll be lapping noon shelter guy in no time. The spring here had a deep-ish swimming hole, so I went for a dip after Giggles and I collected water. I probably scared Giggles.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park, PA

Rain was still falling this morning when we woke up, but was finished by the time we headed out. Even with the rain’s white noise, and sharing space for a second night with the same two non-snorers, I still didn't sleep very well. Maybe it was the shelter journal entry about the possible norovirus outbreak five days earlier that we read about after settling in for the night? Or maybe it was because of the narrow bunk with its single vertical 2 x 4 brace to keep you from rolling off it?Regardless, I was wide awake when I turned on my phone and saw texts, emails and even a Facebook post telling me that my daughter had gone into labor (almost 10 days before her due date). At 3:45 a.m., Myles Samuel was welcomed into the world.  My daughter picked a good day to summon me home. I was four miles from the Mid-Atlantic ATC office in Boiling Springs. Only Harper's Ferry, WV or Duncannon, PA would have provided closer access to an Amtrak station. Those 3.9 miles flew by. I don't think I even noticed the two knobs I ascended, one being Center Point Knob, another one of the Appalachian Trail numerous (albeit historic) midpoints. I did notice another large sinkhole type feature that I passed in the woods. I forgot to report that we had passed a few of these yesterday, wondering about their origins. The holes are as deep as a foundation, ranging from fruit cellar to garage size. I arrived in Boiling Springs by 10:35 where I had arranged for a shuttle pickup at 11 a.m. With good cell coverage, I had been able to book my train through to Milwaukee from the trail at the Alec Kennedy Shelter. That undertaking, in itself, completely differentiates this trip from any of my past experiences. I am now on a 2:36 train with free wi-fi, traveling across Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh. I will connect with the train to Chicago that has my shower and a bed awaiting me. In less than 24 hours, I’ll be meeting the newest member of our family. When I return to the trail, I almost couldn't have a better restart point. The first 12 miles north from Boiling Springs in basically a flat line through farm fields and forests.

This time, for some reason, the Deluxe room was cheaper, so I went with more space, but a worse night’s sleep. The porter confirmed that the wider room and the perpendicular bed rocks and feels the jolts far more than the parallel bed arrangement in the cramped rooms.Or maybe it had something to do with the Z-Quil I took on the first trip. I kept dreaming that the train was rolling along a highway and only occasionally would switch over to a track. Also didn't help that my Pittsburgh transfer was scheduled for 5:20 a.m. I’m heading back to the trail after being back in Wisconsin the past two weeks. It was a good visit. I met the little munchkin pictured left and spent my days cuddling two cutie patooties. I cooked dinner, assisted with bedtime rituals and sung more than a few rounds of “The Wheels on the Bus,” “Baa Baa Black Sheep” and “Hush Little Baby.” I fully expect to have pre-school songs endlessly loop through my head while pushing up a mountain. For some strange reason, I founded myself able to easily devour ice cream whereas I had forfeited that opportunity when I hit the half gallon challenge on the trail just before I left. The three of us went through half gallons of Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip and Chocolate Zanzibar. On the way to the train station, my daughter and I even stopped at 31 Flavors for one last cone. Mother’s Day was spent with more family. I devoted another morning getting the canoe in the water for the first time this year, finally able to try out a new paddle I had received at Christmas. Sam and I even squeezed in an overnight visit to our north woods cabin. Where it snowed. In mid May. I finalized my food drops for the rest of the hike, hit a few yoga classes, was very pleased to find I could still effortlessly walk five miles (yes, without a pack and no, there were few hills, but still…) but noticed how my big toes intermittently go numb, apparently a common side-effect of long-distance hiking. Let's see if this turns into a fun new physical concern back on the trail. I lost five pounds. I finished reading the last remaining chapters of The Snow Leopard that I hadn't been able to get to beforehand. I also caught up on episodes of Survivor and Call the Midwife and saw a forgettable couple win the season finale of The Amazing Race. My cultural literacy is boundless. As far as trail life went off-trail, I kept up with trail rumors and news by following a few hiker blogs of those I had met along the way during the first 24 days, and even received a phone call from Nera with some updates. With the exception of full length gaiters I had intended to use on cold rainy days and never did, I’m returning to the trail with the same gear I started. I did trade out a long-sleeve wool shirt for looser quick dry button-down one and ordered a size smaller Purple Rain hiking skirt, which still fits in spite of all that ice cream I ate before I left. Sort of wish I could have a do over at the Pine Grove General Store, but there are other places where I can eat and miles to walk before I sleep.","Boiling Springs, PA

I knew I couldn't or didn't want to go all the way to the first shelter, 14.7 miles distant, so I instead headed for Carlisle and the Days Inn eight miles away from Boiling Springs. Feels a little wasteful to be staying at a hotel so soon, especially as I showered on the train and the weather was holding, but I originally had anticipated the train running late and that I would have ended up staying at the B&B in town anyway.

Wanted to work on getting it all sorted out sooner than later.The trail is quite flat, passing along fields, some edged by stone walls, or through them. Or meandering through adjacent woods around them. It is also quite a bit greener two weeks later and it seems like the birds are louder and more numerous. Walked about .4 miles along along a busy highway 11, utilizing the nicely mowed lawns of trucking companies, to the Days Inn. Headed over to the most excellent Middlesex Diner soon after checking in.

Clear skies, comfortable temps, no bugs, easy and varied terrain, but I sure took my time leaving the Days Inn in spite of being awake by 6 a.m. I had breakfast at 6:30, was packed and ready by 7, but oh yeah, I forgot to combine my two hand sanitizer bottles. And I really should tape my pinky toes up as they do feel a bit warm from yesterday's hike. And don’t forget to put on the sunscreen. Finally was on the road by 7:45, and by road I mean facing the oncoming morning commuter traffic barreling down Hwy 11. It wasn't particularly dangerous, just an assault to the senses. I slipped back into the woods, passing a lone tent, stealth camping only yards away from the rushing vehicles. Within minutes, bird songs replaced churning tires as the forest absorbed me. I broke through transparent spider webs, the fine phantom filaments tickling my face and clinging to my hat and hair. The first few miles passed between and along more fields. Some landowners mow along the trail, others—not so much. Along the mowed paths, only my shoes got wet from the morning dew. In the early morning unmoved sections, the knee high grasses soaked the edge of my skirt and legs. I passed under another crackling power line and the trail followed a few roads today for short distances. It reminded me of portaging. Instead of leaving the water to avoid plunging over a dangerous waterfall when canoeing, you instead leave the woods in order to avoid crossing busy highways by walking over the overpasses. I merrily waved at the drivers from the bridge above I-81.The trail followed Conodoguinet Creek (I'd call it more of a river) for a nice distance, at times following a boardwalk and where I saw the Canadian geese and goslings. I met Pigeon Toe in this section heading south. Like me, he is scheduled to leave the trail for a few weeks to attend to family—in his case his daughter’s wedding. Unlike me, he started in Georgia as a NOBO. He was jumping ahead and flipflopping south in order to put more miles on before he has to leave, but be in a better position to catch the train out of Harper's Ferry. My goal today was either going to be the Cove Mountain Shelter at 13.6 miles or Duncannon another four miles after that. Even though the day was fine and the trail easy, I was concerned about making my second day back on the trail my longest one yet. AWOL’s guidebook pointed out that the trail begins to get rocky about 2.5 miles south of the Cove Mountain Shelter. Pennsylvania is also known as “Rocksylvannia.” There are rocky stretches to be feared. I thought It best to wait to see how bad the trail turned before deciding. Remember Maryland? There were no warnings about those rocks. But this stretch? Pbbbttt. I’d describe this section as being exactly like Boundary Water portages, except that it went on for miles, not rods. Sure there are rocks, but there are also roots and the duff of the forest floor. I know there are more and different rocks ahead, but this section didn't warrant a special callout in my mind, whereas Maryland most certainly did. I took a long lunch break by a streamside campsite, cooled my feet in the water and finished reading The Point of Vanishing by Howard Axelrod. At 1:30, I only had 3.7 miles left to go before hitting the shelter. I had heard from Nimble and Starbuck that the couple just ahead of me was also from Wisconsin and heading to the same shelter. I also had carried that chicken rice curry dinner in my food bag and if I reached Duncannon tonight, I had another food drop awaiting me. And you don't want food to start accumulating in your pack. Plus, I’m still not certain I want to stay at the notorious hotel. So even though it was only 3:30 and the rocks weren't so bad, I headed to the shelter.The shelter is spacious and nice, but has a critter alert. Porcupines have found it tasty. When I was growing up, my family bought an old A-frame deer hunting cabin. Dad fixed it up and put cedar siding on the front. Boy did the porcupines love that. We’d wake up in the middle of the night to resounding gnawing. The shelter had the same fix as we made to the cabin—three foot high sheet metal all around it. While the shelter floor and bunks showed signs of chewing, nothing was recent. The forecast is for rain tomorrow, so I’m taking my chances staying under a roof. And on a top bunk.Loony and Slug tented out behind the shelter. They retired to Wisconsin seven years ago and are walking the trail to raise money for a children’s museum in their community. Dark Water showed up around dusk, and he will be the first line of defense with against any marauding quill pigs in the shelter tonight. He is sleeping on the floor. Musings: My puritanical self-consciousness almost prevented me from waving at the I-81 traffic today. I could just as easily have kept my head down, trudging over the bridge in search of the next white blaze. Instead I strolled across, head held high exhibiting my best queen mum parade wave. I’m sure a few curmudgeons only saw some wild-haired weirdo acting way too happy way too early in the morning, but waving made me feel good.","Carlisle, PA

We heard snuffles, scratches and the occasional unidentifiable bang. Dark Water saw it at dawn, but I missed it choosing instead to keep the bag drawn over my head to conserve heat. It got cold last night and the rain started. The other three were up and on their way while the rain was pouring down, but I stayed inside finishing up yesterday's post. I was either going to stay at the Doyle or push on another 4.3 miles. By the time I left, the rain had subsided. The mostly unrocky trail continued downhill to the village of Duncannon where lunch accompanied by a Yuengling was to be found. Met up with a freshly showered Dark Water who is staying there overnight. The next three days are going to be interesting. The shelters are either placed really close together or are spaced out over 15 miles. I wanted to push on to make some of that distance more manageable. Rain is predicted for tomorrow, which means another character building opportunity. Today’s last two miles made no mention of rocks, but there were plenty to clamber over. And nary a mention of those in the guidebook. I took my time as the rain started up again. I also stopped to exchange phone numbers with a local dad whose 10-year-old son who had taken off in pursuit of another hiker and ended up being the last one to arrive at the small shelter. There are several other people tent camping including Loony and Slug. And the dad found his son soon after we departed ways.I’m building plenty of character tonight hunkered down in a cold, damp shelter with three other younger women and one dog while listening to a dull thuds, bangs and shooting going off at a nearby military base. Or so that’s what we've been told. Maybe I should have built my character staying at the Doyle after all. Musings: There are far more men on the trail than women, and the percentage of 20-somethings appears to be higher than 50-somethings plus—the two main age demographics of folks who generally have the time to carve six months out of their lives for hiking. But there is a double standard placed upon the women. Whereas the men are encouraged to have fun, women are implored to be safe. Tonight I learned about pink blazing*—men who pursue or attach themselves to solo female hikers. It's not necessarily stalking, but it can be unwanted and unwarranted chivalrous behavior targeted at women, especially the younger ones. One of tonight's shelter companions was purposely slowing down her hike in order to avoid a young man who, among other things, offered to carry items in her pack for her, take care of her dog and book a hotel room for her in town. It’s one thing to avoid amorous overtures in the city, quite another when you are all traveling in the same direction and camping at the same shelters. The women I’ve met thus far are extremely strong and confident. Another shelter companion (Hana Solo) hiked 35 miles two days ago. She certainly doesn't need anyone carrying gear for her. I find it sad that attitudes haven't changed all that much in the years since I first set foot in the Appalachian Trail all those spring breaks ago. I still find myself a minority within a male-dominated activity. *There are many types of “blazing.” The AT is marked by white blazes and purists will only follow these blazes representing the official route. Blue blazes are side trails that usually lead to water sources or a shelter, but sometimes might cut off a short section of the AT trail. A purist would go back to the point at which the the was departed after using a blue blaze trail. Yellow blazing is when a hiker might avoid a section and/or jump ahead by being shuttled to a different point by road without hiking to it. Aqua blazing is canoeing a section in lieu of hiking—Shenandoah National Park is sometime circumvented in this manner. Pink blazing is just plain sexist.","Cove Mountain Shelter, Duncannon, PA

Might also have been due to no snorers in the house or the white noise of rain, which is what we woke up to. Today is a hard day to plan. The next shelter is only 6.7 miles away. The one after that is over 17 or 24 miles from where I stayed last night. Am planning to put the tent to use tonight, but it's a matter of when and where. And, it will likely have to be pitched in the rain, something I've been able to avoid this far due to the available and conveniently placed shelters. A few people I camped with last night are getting real sick of the rain. Apparently I missed a long streak while I was back in Wisconsin. One man decided to use the trail to quit smoking and has been on the trail for five weeks. He announced this morning that he was taking the next Greyhound bus home. It could also be that he crapped his pants (or so he said) when he thought he was getting attacked by an inquisitive bear. The beat turned out to be hiker’s dog sticking its head inside the guy’s tent while he was packing up. Tensions are high this morning. I started off with just my umbrella, but put on my rain jacket to help keep warm almost immediately after taking off. After a little while, Nova, one of the young women who stayed in the shelter, caught up to me. We hiked together to the Peters Mountain Shelter where we stopped for lunch and met up with other campers from the night before. Each of the shelters have trail journals, and this one was pretty new. I have been flipping back to see when the hikers I had been hanging out with before passed through. The first entry was dated May 10, by the trail crew. It stated that the last journal had been found burned in the fire pit and some knuckleheads had burned the shelter curtain, bulletin board and plant restoration fencing at this shelter. When I went to use the privy, an attempt to burn the signage had been made there too. There was Libertarian-like graffiti attributed to Thomas Jefferson stating a right to possess drugs, guns but without any government oversight scrawled on the outhouse door. Apparently Jefferson freely dropped the F-bomb in his oratorios. I did not know this. I may be making a jump here, but I’d bet the farm that the noted quote and arson are related. After cooling down over lunch, it was time to get moving to heat back up. Nova and I started out together again. The rain had pretty much quit, so I stopped to stow my umbrella--and lost Nova to the mists. I’m not having good luck hiking with people in fog. Within a few miles, I reached my 300 mile mark and stopped to commemorate it with a photo by an obscured foggy view. I caught up to Loony and Slug, who were planning on stopping at the next campsite, 11.1 miles from last night's shelter. I wanted to put on some more miles, so we said goodbye. When I passed it, I noticed that it was an awesome campsite. Great view (once the fog clears up), on the ridge and under pine trees. Am really hoping I can find the same in four more miles. This stretch didn't have many water sources (if you aren't counting the rain), which is another reason I wanted to push on. There were several springs beginning a mile after that campsite. The first one was at the bottom of a long descent. Then the rain started again. It was now around 5 p.m. And I figured I might as well keep hiking since stopping meant getting everything soaked. I started back up, in search of another perfectly placed site with my new water supply. And up. And up. The trail was great—a mostly graded path with a gradual ascent, but no decent campsite options. And the rain was stopping. I now decided that I would take the first site that looked promising. Okay, maybe the second site. I could go a little farther. When I finally did stop, it was 6:45 p.m. I’m camped alone by some rocks at the Horse-Shoe Trail turnoff. There is a commemorative plaque nearby that I didn't stop to read in full, but has something to do with a 121 mile long trail from Valley Forge by some historical figure. Tucked back in my dampish feeling sleeping bag listening to the dripping leaves and imagining ticks roaming in my hair.

It took longer than I intended packing up this morning. I made coffee, wiped down the tent and did other morning rituals that ultimately took over almost two hours. Finally was on the trail a little before 9 a.m. Wouldn't you know it, not 200 yards further up the trail was that (more) perfect campsite nestled under pine trees at a former fire tower site. The concrete footings were all that remained. About an hour into my hike I heard Johnny Walker approaching. We talked briefly and I moved over to let him pass, but we kept on talking and I fell into step behind him for the next two hours. By noon, we had done 7.9 miles and stopped at Rausch Creek where there were campsites. He needed to dry out his hammock in the warm sun and I needed to soak my feet in the cold stream. We are both headed to another campsite 5.9 miles up the trail. I left before he did, saying I was sure he’d pass me up again or I'd see him at the campsite. The lunch break had once been part of the Village of Rausch Gap, the site of a former coal mining community in the early 1800s. At one time, more than 1000 people lived here. Now it is nothing but forest and trails. And a stream purification well built upon a Swedish model. The rehabilitation is helping to bring back brook trout and other life to the stream where acids still leach from those old mines. The same stream wear I had been soaking my feet. And gathering water to carry. The process adds lime as water washes through crushed gravel to help normalize the ph balance. I read all about this at the informational kiosk. Partly due to my stream educating side trip, Johnny Walker again caught up to me. Those NOBOs are so darn fast. Within minutes we heard thunder. We kept walking. Closer thunder. We kept walking. Raindrops. I pulled out my umbrella and he donned a poncho. We kept walking. The raindrops started to pummel us. Johnny Walker took off trying to make it to a underpass (which turned out to be quite a bit further up the trail) and I ducked under some hemlocks to wait it out. And the thunder did pass and the rain did slow down. Onward I went. Despite the trail having turned into a stream, I needed to collect another quart of water before heading to my final campsite destination. The AT guidebook points out things like shelters, campsites and springs. There was no water (ha!) indicated at my ending point. When I reached the last water source, a stream, it was muddy from all the afternoon rain. I'm using a Steripen water purifier which uses ultraviolet light to (magically!) sterilize the water. I stick the pen-like instrument into my water bottle and 90 seconds later, clean water. Except when the water is turbulent and muddy. There is no filter to trap sediment like other water purification systems. Not only that, this water was flowing under a road—and I make it a rule to avoid those water “opportunities” along the trail for such reasons as pavement runoff, plastic crap, bottles, old t-shirts—all things I saw trapped along the shore after I skimmed the cleanest water I thought I could. I’ll just boil it in addition to Steripenning it and I'll never notice in it in my dinner tonight. Or coffee tomorrow. Back on the trail, I noticed a hammock and there was Johnny Walker setting up at a nice clearing the woods. By a much better looking stream. Out dumps the urban effluent and in runs spring water. I told JW that I didn't think this was the designated campsite and even though it was a nice spot, and even though we were hearing thunder again, I wanted to get further along the trail. And because of that, I got to set up my tent in the rain.But the sun is now out again. I am dry and had a yummy hot dinner lacking any trace of transmission fluids, plastic or t-shirts.","Stealth Camp

That will get you moving, although as it turned out, still not fast enough. I was awake by 5:30, up by 6, but not packed up and ready to roll until 7:45 a.m. By then, my t-shirt was almost dry. There are two reasons why it takes me a while to get going:1)        I heat up water to make coffee and/or food and2)        I sponge off the wet tent and have to pack it up. Last night’s campsite was maybe a half mile away from I-81 and I heard engine braking all night long. For the first hour, the trail ran parallel to the interstate highway and for most of the morning, traffic sounds could be heard. People are sadly mistaken about the Appalachian Trail being wilderness. In many places, the trail is just out of sight of thousands of people—which is still kind of cool to think about. I'll never look at highway frontage woods quite the same again. The trail dipped down and through a rhododendron canopy before passing over the 55mile long Swatara Creek Water Trail and under I-81. Once it hit the ridge line, the trail stayed there for the next 10 miles. There were acres of Wild Geranium, Mayapples and Purple Phlox and the occasional views of the farming valleys below.I stopped for lunch and a water resupply at the William Penn Shelter and met up with Dark Water and Hannah Solo from a few days earlier. Hannah started out first and I kept pace with Dark Water until we hit rocks in the last mile. He was much more nimble and cavalier whereas I slowly picked my way through the boulder minefield. My destination tonight was the renown 501 Shelter located only .1 miles off of Route 501. It is really a large shed owned by an AT supporter. The main draw is that pizza can be ordered and delivered to hikers. They also have an outdoor solar shower which I was only too happy to use. I met two more Wisconsites: a dad and his son, “Pup” from Oregon, Wisconsin. (And yes, Wisconsin Public Radio’s Dr. Zorba IS his physician for real.) They started from Harper's Ferry about two weeks ago and have consistently been putting on 18 mile days. Pup is planning on flipflopping. The dad needs to return to his teaching job and is only going as far as Maine. They get going at 5:45 a.m., so yeah, likely won't be seeing them again anytime soon.Because of the allure of easy to get food, Dark Water had me concerned that the shelter might be full in spite of my early 3:30 arrival time. But as it turned out, six people took showers, ordered pizza, then hiked on for another 5 miles, leaving another six of us here. And because it was hot today, the enclosed shelter is actually too warm. I set up my tent to dry and then decided to camp out. But I did order pizza. And pierogis. And a sub to take with me for lunch tomorrow.","Campsite, Licksdale, PA

Nasty, filthy NOBOs. We hates them. If you didn't get my Lord of the Rings analogy (Mom), this might sound like I lost it. Actually the rocks are nasty things that we hate. I have no idea how the six NOBOs managed to hike more than 5 miles after a grocery run and pizza feed last night, but it took me over 3.5 hours to navigate this section this morning. By contrast, I knocked out the next 5 miles in 2.25 hours. From the beginning, I was like a sullen teenager, dragging my feet and daydreaming about all the mean things I could say about this section like “the road to hell is paved with Pennsylvanian rocks.” To get a a feel of how my feet felt, take the knuckle of your index finger and push it as hard as you can into the meaty part of your palm where your thumb joint is located. Go ahead. I’ll wait. Now do this repeatedly for hours on end. After carefully picking your way across the gardens o’ pain, gripping with toes and grinding into soles, you want to pick up speed as soon as you reach a relatively smooth piece of a pine needle cushioned thoroughfare. But your feet say, “Oh no you don't! We're using this time to fully stretch out for a bit. And we're letting you know by sending some soul-crushing (see what I did there?) messages your way as long as you keep hiking. Contestants on one season of the reality TV show, The Amazing Race, were once subjected to one of those painful Chinese foot massages during a “road block.” It’s the kind of therapeutic treatment that makes you scream, but then afterwards your feet feel better. Not so with the Pennsylvania foot massage. The day before, Dark Water had showed me how to rock hop in order to make time over these sections. Those fleet-footed NOBOs. They are flitting, flying and hippety-hopping their way across “Rocksylvannia.” The trick is staying high, using the tallest, most boulder-like rocks vs. trying to place your foot on the softest piece of the ground or maneuvering around them. Still need to be careful where to place your foot, but this really only works on larger rocks. Today’s rocks ranged in size from russet potatoes to Paris Hilton’s dog carrier. And they occupied 75 - 90% of the trail’s surface. You can't do any rock hopping on bits this small. Part of the concern with all these rocks is worrying about my trekking poles getting jammed and then snapping. The rocks catch them. After eating the now-soggy, yet still incredibly delicious sub I had bought the night before, I met up with a dad and his adult son out for a day hike. I was bitching about all the rocks and told them how I will typically will start to look forward to a shelter by late afternoon. Not so today. I pretty much fantasized about getting to the shelter within the first hour. Probably didn't help that is was in the 80s too. Not five minutes after I let them pass, I hear a shout 50 yards ahead. Dad had just passed a trail side rattlesnake that his son saw. Now that will adjust your attitude. After taking pictures, dad used a stick to coax it off trail. If they had been using trekking poles, they might have nailed it. It was maybe 5’ long and had six or eight rattles and did not like being moved. I noticed that dad let son hike in the front after that. I took a longer break around 2:30 p.m. to work on this entry and read. At 4:15 p.m. And with another two miles to go, rock gardens began reappearing. I took a picture of what hate looks like. Only one NOBO passed me all day. I arrived at the shelter expecting to find it empty. Instead we've got a bustling little village with all sorts of sectional hikers who primarily started north of here, and a Spanish NOBO who just arrived after hiker midnight (8 p.m.) He did over 30 miles. We hates them very much. (Just kidding.)","Route 501 Shelter, Pine Grove, PA

The last two arrivals slid in between me (in the far right corner) and two 60-year-old section hikers (in the far left corner.) Besides any threat of rain, criteria I use to determine if I will stay in a shelter is: do the hikers appear well-adjusted, do they snore and do they smell? The two guys already residing in the far corner passed, but I didn't have any control over the late-comers who tucked in. Fortunately, neither snored or smelled, but one of the two was up at 5:15, which meant we were all up shortly thereafter. Because I was headed for town, getting an early start was just fine. Plus it was predicted to be 70 degrees by 7.a.m. I made it to town by noon. In addition to The Port Clinton Hotel, there is a vintage candy store and barber shop. The barber shop welcomes hikers to hang out and offers cookies and coffee. It was pretty awesome. That where I found my hiking pals from a few days ago. They are going to take a zero day. I picked up my mail drop with the next four-five days of food and got a ride with one of the shop's ""regular's"" to pick up a few fresh things and some power/granola bars. The rocks were still present today, and will be until New Jersy, but I started trying to read them like rapids, looking for navigational routes. Unlike paddling where you avoid boulders, scouting instead for ""v's"" and wave trains to carry you around or over the obstacles, I looked for the biggest, broadest and best rocks to place my footing. This last half mile descent slipping into town was a doozy though. Few rocks, but an incline of 60 degrees--or so it seemed. That alone took me 45 minutes. Today wasn't as bad mentally, but then it was shorter.Now isn't that ironic? At one time, 9 miles was a full day of hiking. Everything is relative.","Eagles Nest Shelter, PA

I was freely borrowing Thomas Jefferson’s use of the f-bomb (see my previous post on Day 27 for that reference) and it probably didn't help that the hotel offered no coffee as part of the stay. I doubt if I was dragging my sorry ass more than 1 mph up the hill out of Port Clinton. Probably less. The only upside was that the mosquito population hasn't exploded just yet and I didn't have to worry about having repellent drip off of me along with the sweat. Actually, there is a second blessing. The springs are all running this time of year. I cannot imagine THAT torture of having to walk in the heat, over these rocks and carry enough water. As it was, I downed 3.5 liters of water.I seriously contemplated blue blazing a cutoff that would have eliminated almost six miles. Doing that, however, would have meant missing two main overlook destinations: Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle. I trudged on and met a weekend hiker on his way down. He greeted me with the usual “how ya doing?” And my answer wasn't exactly positive. We talked for a bit and he said the final six miles after the Pinnacle followed a dirt road and not all these hellish rocks. Something to look forward to…Two minutes later I summited Pulpit Rock, where surprise (!) there were a dozen other people eating lunch and enjoying the really spectacular view. One group of enthusiastic older teenagers were out for the weekend and it was pretty entertaining listening to them. They also were climbing some of the rocks that another visitor cautioned were home to copperheads. But alas, no snakes. Feeling a bit more buoyed, I started out for my second half of the day and while yes, the trail was indeed much smoother, I still wanted this day to be over. Picking up my speed aggravated my bruised feeling feet.If it wasn't for the promise of a room (and shower) at a B&B at the end of the day, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have hiked this far. A 20-year-old hiker told me that she's cried at least five times since she's started and I thought to myself, well yeah, you're only 20, but I almost cried when I saw this farm retreat. Even though I had just stayed at the Port Clinton Hotel the night before after camping out for six nights straight, I saw that it was going to be in the 90’s for at least the next two days. I found this place, Common Grounds. They only had an opening for Friday, but I learned that Saturday’s guest for the room I’m booked is also a hiker and there are two beds in the room. If she's willing to share, I'm in. If not, the hosts said they'd work something out. I must look pretty bad! So an unscheduled, but extremely grateful, first real zero for me tomorrow.The only injury I have is a persistent bruising feeling inside my left foot sole, near the inside heel. A lot of people have fallen while hiking in PA, twist their ankles or hurt their knees. In that department, my body has been holding up. I'm hoping a zero helps my foot out too.

We are heading in the same direction oftentimes exerting effort heading uphill, sometimes passing each other, sometimes falling back, but all with a shared goal to reach an end.

It poured last night, but I never heard it over the white noise of the AC (again). A couple I talked with for a long time over lunch told me it started around midnight, hard, and never let up until 6 a.m. I hung around eating breakfast with all the guests this morning and didn't get on the trail until 10 a.m. 
The trail wasn't too bad today (aka hellish spikes), unless that zero really did a number on my perception. There was one tough rock scramble at Bake Oven Knob up first. The rocks were still very slippery and the higher altitude still held the clouds. No riding the boulder wave train this misty morning. 
I took my time because there were only two overnight options at the end of the day:
-	A shelter located only 7.8 miles away or
-	A B&B pick-up at either mile 8.8 or 13.5
I wanted to see what the shelter situation was like before I made up my mind. 
Four miles of ridge line yielded many gorgeous pine needle carpeted stealth campsites, but none near a water source. Plus it would have been too early to stop. I headed toward the shelter. As I passed between ostrich ferns through the soft wood forest under a cloudless sky, I finally figured out the source of the raining sounds I’ve been hearing for the past few days. Sibilating frass. That’s quietly falling gypsy moth poop, my friends.
By 3:15 p.m., the shelter was full of people, some just escaping from the afternoon heat and thinking about heading further through the upcoming four mile zinc mining Superfund site. Some already hunkered down for the night and staking claim to their spot. And all save one unfortunate soul, in their 20s. Or younger. Beavis and Butthead were having quite the discussion about a f’ing dude who only showered four times during his entire thru hike. Dude! That’s f’ing insane! Huh.huh.huh.huh. 
Let's just say that I wasn't into the vibe and leave it at that. I hiked a mile farther and my plastic and I are now very happy to be ensconced at this lovely B&B, the Filbert House, just slightly north of the waterless wasteland of the Superfund site near Palmerton, PA. And where I was quite content to take full advantage of hot running water. 
Oh, and rain is expected to again fall overnight.","Bake Oven Knob Road, PA

As I’m not up to 20 mile days by any stretch of the imagination, and there are these obstacles called rocks to slow me down, and there is no water in this stretch, I lobed off those miles. The B&B is located closer to Little Gap Road, so that's where I started. Stilled pulled a long day. Debated trying to hit a hotel, but now it's perfect camping weather and this isn't the Camino where you do actually walk inn to inn or hostel. So if you are keeping a tally, until tonight, I'm carrying a tent and just spent five consecutive nights not camping. The downside is that this waterless stretch means I'm short on water. I have enough to last me until reaching the next spring—8 miles from here tomorrow, but it's going to be a bit of a sticky sleep. It certainly was a sweaty hike getting here. The trail was still rocky, more so it seemed, on a four mile stretch before Wind Gap. Otherwise, it doesn't seem to be any more difficult than other sections I've articulated my displeasure over. And I crossed over the 400 mile mark.","Walnutport, PA

In a word: Disrupted.Yesterday, after hiking until 6:30 p.m., and after a 700’ climb out of Wind Gap, I was interested in finding anything resembling a stealth site, sooner than later. Typically stealth camps are not all that hidden, more like unofficial campsites. What they have going are flat pieces of ground and maybe a fireplace where the rocks have found a more suitable purpose. I had passed many all day yesterday. The next shelter was still more than seven miles away and the next established campsite was three. I think I may have mentioned rocks before? Finding a flat, rock-free surface was hard, but I finally did find a little chunk totally acceptable. Set up my tent, heated a little water to reconstitute my delicious beef curry noodle bowl, sponged off as best I could, wrote, read and…was almost asleep when I hear clicking trekking poles announcing the approach of another hiker. Turned out to be one of the young ones I was attempting to distance myself from. And the one with a 5-month old puppy. That's right. A dog that would be the equivalent of a six-year-old. There have been more than one of us who believe this hiker is making it walk much too far because she has her own mileage goals. When she passed me last night at 8:45, it was dark and she said she was headed to the shelter. The one seven miles away. I later found out she arrived after 1 a.m. That made her day’s hike well above 20 miles. Know any six-year-olds that could do that? She’s gonna make a great mom someday. We used to have a landline with a phone in our bedroom that didn't reach a bedside table. Whenever it would ring in the middle of the night, I’d bolt over to it, almost before the second ring, and answer while practically still asleep. After the not-making-good-choices girl left, I fell back asleep, but was reawakened by the sound of a nearby animal. I bolted up before I was fully awake yelling Hey! Hey! Hey! Get out of here! And something big went crashing away. Fumbled for my light and flashed it all over the now still woods. Only the quiet raining of frass was heard. My phone said it was 10:55 p.m. Could have been a deer, could have been a bear. I don't think it was a toad, the usual culprit. Although, come to think of it, I'm not very far from the toxic Superfund site.Now typically, something like that would keep my heart racing and I'd find it hard to go back to sleep. But not tonight. I was beat. I fell back asleep clutching my headlamp in case I'd be reawakened. Which I was again. This time, exactly an hour later by headlamp.I was close to the trail and people do night-hike, especially when it's hot and the days are long, so it didn't freak me out to see a light shining on my tent. I assumed the hiker saw my campsiteand was scoping out the flat land opportunity. And because of an unknown large animal whereabouts, I was more than open to sharing my space. So I helpfully flashed the light I had been clutching. In spite of the late hour and questionable judgement, the hiker appeared normal and I talked him about the potential flat areas. He flashed his powerful beam around some more. I asked him where he had hiked in from, and I thought he said he had been visiting friends in Wind Gap. Wind Gap? That was just at the bottom of the hill—less than two miles away. He mumbled something about hiking this section before or going back and forth or hiking ten miles. I'm not sure. He was doing a lot of mumbling. And talking to himself. At least that is what I think he was doing. After flattening some nearby ferns (so, he wasn't into the “leave no trace” ethic), and smoking two cigarettes, Billy-Bob finally settled into his half-pitched solo tent. Likely on a pile of rocks.Still dead tired and still sticky, I settled back down into my sleeping bag. Five hours later, I woke up wee-rested, uneaten and unmolested, but still sticky. My eye was now firmly fixed on Delaware Water Gap—home to ice cream, beer, food, air conditioned hotels and the state border. One of my guidebooks indicated that this last stretch would take longer than expected, but I didn't find it any more—or less—maddening than the rest of northern Pennsylvania thus far. About an hour into my hike, LLRetro caught up to me. He was the “unfortunate” soul who I perceived had been stuck in that shelter two days ago with Beavis and Butthead. Turns out most people ended up hiking on that night, but yeah, I seem to be currently hiking in a bubble with kids mostly the age of my own. Or younger. Hiked with LLRetro the rest of the day. The trail went over one more viewpoint, Wolf Rocks, where two people warned of having seen Copperheads, stopped at the Kirkridge Shelter to finally replenish my now-empty water bottles with water right from a tap, up a less rocky road to Mt. Minis, where a communications tower had replaced the former fire tower and started the descent into Delaware Water Gap.We arrived in mid-afternoon, where the first thing I did was to eat two scoops of ice cream at the conveniently placed trail side ice cream shoppe, then went back and got a third one. Am staying the night at an Inn which several people had warned was “not very nice,” but I am finding it fine. It's seen better days, but so have other hotels along the trail. At least this one has an acceptably clean unshared bathroom, even if the TP dispenser is falling off the wall and the bedside light lamp shades are in various degrees of crumbling. And for the win, the sheets appear to have been changed.","Stealth Camp, past Wind Gap, PA

A lot of hikers took a zero today and stayed for the free Thursday night hiker feed at the church in DWG. Nova, LL Retro and I hiked on, but I eventually fell behind as my left foot continued to give me problems. Especially on the rockier sections—which did not end at the state line. And a state line I did cross—New Jersey! Hikers have to cross the Delaware River following a pedestrian walkway on Interstate 80. City or trail planners have thoughtfully painted the state border lines halfway across the bridge. I stopped at the Sunfish Pond to soak my feet and stayed reading a book. Nova saw the first snake in the water. The lake was a nice break from the green tunnel of trees. The day was a nice one for being outside. The trail follows an open ridge line here in New Jersey (with less rocks) to the summit of Kittatinny Mountain. I liked this section very much, but of course that changed over the two mile rocky descent to the Mohican Outdoor Center (MOC). I arrived more than two hours after the others, but then again, I did stop to read my book over lunch. Still, the trail was annoying. I saw the second snake, a four foot black racer or rat snake just before reaching the MOC.I was even more annoyed when I went to retrieve my mail drop containing my next five day supply of food and more map sections at the front desk. They couldn't find it. Ugh….Seriously? Again? A half hour later, the manager returned and brought me my shredded box containing one package of Via Fruit Fusion mix and my maps. The mail carrier had left two boxes at the bottom of the road outside of the mailbox instead of delivering them to the office. Mine was one of the two destroyed by a bear last week. I've just spent the past two hours attempting to figure out my next week and what towns I now need to stop at to resupply. I still have two days of food—and thanks to the post office, the AMC fronted me a dinner and room in one of the cabins. As I write this, a bear has been working the dumpster two buildings away. Other people saw it, but I can only hear it from where I'm sitting. New Jersey is home to the highest concentration of black bears found on the AT. Let's see how the wildlife sightings go this week. Musings: Yesterday, there was discussion about Grandma Gatewood and how the trail differed in her day. For example, she likely didn't burn out her eight pairs of Keds hiking over these rocks. Likewise, the first blind hiker to thru-hike, probably didn't have nearly as many disconcerting ridge line obstacles to overcome. The trail has been rerouted since their days, when it followed more country roads. And my feet want to know why, why, why?","Delaware Water Gap, PA

Hiked all day with LL Retro as we solved the world’s problems. In the afternoon, we ran into “Dys-feng-shui-nal, a woman that a Facebook friend we both had in common had told me about. It was a moment of “Hey! I know you!” when in fact I really did not. That happens out here. You hear about people and then paths do cross. Dys-feng-shui-nal is a sports med doctor and took a look at the foot that has been giving me problems. Pennsylvania may not have been the problem—well at least as far as blaming the rocks goes. The issue appears to be plantar fasciitis caused by overuse. I’m loading up on Ibroprophen to help relieve the inflammation and will re-evaluate my insoles when I reach a town with a shoe store.

Pine needles line the trails in many places and there are views at the summits. We've been hiking through the Stokes State Forest yesterday and today. Ran into Dysfengshunal about an hour after I left the shelter and we hiked together the rest of the day talking books. Stopped for lunch at Gyps Tavern with its outdoor seating overlooking Kittatinny Lake and the small mountain we had just descended. Hung out there for two hours, the first 30 minutes awaiting for it to open.Even though we only had 5.8 miles left, hiking after two pints, a loaded cheeseburger and sweet potato fries proved tiring. We passed a fire tower and met a woman from Manhattan, out for a section hike through New Jersey. Passed a large slate floored outdoor pavilion falling into disrepair and rendered the woods for the last three long miles to the shelter. ATWeather.com predicts heavy rain tonight. Got some trail magic at the shelter tonight. Beer angels! Two young men had been planning to stay the night and do a little hiking on Sunday. Until the heard about the coming rain and were invited out with some friends. So they opened up their canteened growlers and shared their amber ale and IPA with us before their ride picked them up. Unlike last night, there are only four of us at tonight's low profile, stone shelter. Merlin and his dog, Monkey and Purples were also at Gyps Tavern but had passed us during those last miles. We were able to take care of the beer, get dinner done and set up camp before the first raindrops fell. There are lots of brownish red millipedes here—and have been all along the trail since Pennsylvania. They look like short night crawlers with legs and like caterpillars, which are also present in droves, are everywhere. On the trail, on the rocks, on the picnic tables, which is where I sat on one. I need to look them up online when I get a connection—not only to learn what they are but if they sting when squished, because I sure felt something through both my skirt and shorts. I can feel raised welts on my backside, but I'm not asking anyone to look—yet.","Brink Shelter, Stokes State Forest, NJ

And by relatively, I mean that the shelter’s tin roof leaked only a little. The white noise of the rain lulled me to sleep. The splash of some errant drops and the small puddle forming next to my head only momentarily disturbed my slumber. Likewise, an errant mouse only momentarily caused alarm when I awoke a second time to feel it exploring my hair, which yes, is starting to resemble nesting material. I did two things today I haven't done in decades. I ate a chocolate Poptart for breakfast and drank a free Pepsi that the Highpoint State Park office gives to thru-hikers. The Poptart was another trail magic gift left in the shelter bear box along with a bunch of other treats. I thought I'd just have a nibble and then I ended up scarfing up the whole thing. Poptarts can be a hiker breakfast staple, but I have yet to crave them. The Pepsi went down pretty easily too—in spite of the cool, rainy morning. The rain had stopped by the time I left the shelter and the first two miles of hiking was in what Dysfengshunal termed “ambient moisture.” Some sections of the trail were rather rocky in a bluff sort of way, bluffs that had to be climbed over or down. Earlier today I had been reflecting how Pennsylvania would wind the trail up and over the bluffs and ridges, making you scramble along them for some time, before taking you down the same way. Whereas New Jersey just gets you up to a ridge to keep heading north. But that was not the situation today. I'm just glad it wasn't raining when we hit those bluffs. Instead, we only had to deal with pummeling rain for the last half mile. We had almost made it to the state park office. Arrived in a puddle to claim our Pepsi. I wrote a few postcards while Dysfengshunal organized a mail drop and we waited out the downpour. It was now after noon, so we headed over to the concessions stand by the empty beach for something hot to eat. A ranger stopped by and mentioned the severe weather on the way. Thinking only of safety…and a hot shower…and laundry, we decided to seek out the nearest shelter—a nearby motel room that we are sharing. Thunderstorms are predicted again for tonight.

After eating leftover Chinese food for breakfast, we were ready to head back to the trail by 7:30…but there was a slight mix-up about our shuttle. We had to wait almost an hour longer and it just about killed me. The cavalier New Jersey motel manager more or less told us to “fagetaboutit.”Not sure if was due to a short hiking day yesterday or because today was so gorgeous, but I think it was mostly due to the trail. Almost all 14.1 miles were what I'd finally consider a real trail. None of this alternating beds of hard and soft Paleozoic sedimentary rocks folded like the wrinkles in a kicked throw rug. Or walking on ill placed cobbles. Yesterday Highpoint State Park was socked in by fog and mists. Today the vistas were clear. I could clearly see the 220’ tower from the observation platform. With the exception of slipping on a boulder heading out of the state park (third fall to date, but I caught myself from a complete wipeout), the trail was smooth and meandered along more rock walls and streams, aside ponds, through fields and around a wildlife preserve. This was the first day in a long time where I could look up and not worry about stumbling (first misstep not withstanding). There was nice breeze the entire time and the humidity was much, much lower. Even though my AT mileage was 14.1, I actually hiked closer to 16. Yesterday’s goal originally was the Murray property—a beloved secret shelter hosted for over 20 years by a former through-hiker. There is well water, several out buildings and a shower. I wanted to see it and I wanted to replenish my water. A few miles later was the village of Unionville, New York that had two food stores. I needed to resupply the food I missed from my mauled drop. The general store was nice. It had a deli, ice-cream and hiker food, but I honestly do not know how thru-hikers resupply from these places on a regular basis. I stared blankly at the Knorr's Pasta Sides trying to find something that would be appealing and mixed with something else. I miss my recipes. My next drop is coming next week. I had an egg-salad sandwich, orange juice and an ice-cream bar for lunch while I recharged my phone. From Unionville, the trail followed roads. Meh. It then circled the Wallkill Wildlife Refuge, which was a little tedious—but hey, no rocks. Had to carry water the last .5 miles up Pochuck Mountainous the shelter, which was about the most taxing thing about today’s hike. The water source was a spigot from the back of a vacant house—a little creepy, but then again, it didn't need to be filtered. Millipede Update: So, interesting information. Turns out that the giant millipede releases toxins as a defense mechanism, like when it gets sat upon. The harmful toxins include:•        Hydrochloric acid•        Hydrogen cyanide•        Organic acids•        Phenol•        Cresols•        Benzoquinones•        Hydroquinones (in some millipedes)And if the millipede toxin gets on the skin, symptoms may include:•        Staining (skin turns brown)•        Intense burning or itching•        BlistersYup.","Highpoint State Park, NJ

The days of sleeping out in the open shelters are getting numbered. The trail today was a mixed bag: some rocks, a long boardwalk, a wooden suspension bridge, a one-mile climb and another state park. Yesterday, Dysfengshunal and I decided to work with a motel up the trail who will slack pack us for a few days. We hiked with our packs, got picked up at 5 p.m. and brought to Greenwood Lake, NY where we are staying at Antons motel. Tomorrow we will hike without our gear and attempt to put on some more miles. We’ll get a ride back to the state park, where we stopped yesterday and hike past Greenwood Lake, then have the shuttle pick us up and bring us back to the motel again. Her knee has been bothering her and my foot is still giving me issues, although I think it is improving with Ibroprophen and ice. Walking along the boardwalk was an interesting departure from the footpath. It ended with a small suspension bridge over a stream. Fourty-five minutes later, we walked over a railroad track and through a cow pasture to a road that offered two eateries near Vernon, NJ—Mitch’s Roadside Grill and Heaven Hill Farm Market. Dysfengshunal had been looking forward to eating a Knish ever since she had read about it in the guidebook. We headed there first. Unfortunately, Mitch no longer served Knishes and being vegetarian, there wasn't anything on the menu besides chips and soda for my friend. Meanwhile I wolfed down two hotdogs with garlic and onions. Next, we headed to Heaven Hill where I brought and ate the rest of my lunch while waiting out a short downpour with NOBO “Hops.” Lunch and rain done, we then headed one mile straight up following the “Stairway to Heaven” stone steps and boulders to a view overlooking the valley and Heaven Hill Farm. The sun was shining and it was hot. The trail continued to be somewhat rocky as we hiked on toward the state park, but the pine trees, steams and ponds were diversions. With less than a half mile to our designated pick-up, the sky suddenly went black and thunder rolled. We got hit with a quick downpour right before our ride showed up. Met up with Dysfengshunal’s Chicago friends here at the motel and headed out to dinner at Emeralds across the bridge from Antons. Hiking to motels works just fine for me.","Pochuck Mtn. Shelter

Today was supposed to be one of making some miles up slack packing. Scattered showers were predicted and we had our rain gear. The day started out sunny and we crunched out a few good miles before we hit the New Jersey/New York border. We knew we were in New York, because the painted rocks told us so. We even goofed off taking “Eva Jima” photos by the American flag perched upon the highest point of the AT in New York.  The trail followed smooth boulder outcrops along the ridge for some time which is when the rain started. I already was wearing my rain jacket as a wind breaker, but for some (dumb, dumb, dumb) reason, I didn't pull out my rain kilt. In hindsight I suppose I had thought, like yesterday, it would be a passing shower. And also, we had a motel to return to that afternoon, so getting wet was no big deal. However. It was a cold rain. Dysfengshunal saw sleet. And it didn’t pass. My quick dry skirt was now soaked and our fingers were becoming numb. The best thing to do was to just keep moving.  We were on top of the world at this point, skittering up and down glacially-scrubbed granite. Greenwood Lake paralleled the ridge far below. There were moments when we couldn't move all the fast as we crab-scuttled down the increasingly wet rock surfaces. We both fell once—neither very hard—but still a rude reminder that we aren't young things able to easily bounce right back up. Still, I liked this section very much. Pine forests; hard, smooth rocks and bluffs; clear lakes—and the mountain laurel was in full bloom. We hiked for the next three hours without a break, shoving various bars (candy and otherwise) into our mouths to keep fueled as we headed to the Creamery where we hoped to find hot food. Instead we only found delicious, yet cold ice cream and other hikers drying out while frantically searching for lodging and shuttles. Knowing we had a motel room to head back to, I was up for continuing another few miles, but it was now going on 3 p.m. and our motel shuttle was on its way to pick up two of the hikers, so our day ended after 9.5 miles. And I won't say that the hot shower back at the motel was a waste of time at all. The skies did clear and enjoy did we, a hypothermia-free walk to Murphy’s Tavern for dinner.

Everyone we hiked with said more or less the same thing in passing. Also received lots of trail magic. Water at many of the crossings, Gatorade, fresh fruit, even an assembly of sociable plastic chairs to rest our weary legs as we ate our treats.  The trail was rocky, but a different kind of rocks—exactly as someone described in a comment recently, “New York rocks are larger and smoother, like hard dirt.” We hiked over lots of areas of large, nice hard dirt today. Plus a bunch of smaller, annoying bits too. The views were striking, one of which was the sight of the interstate highway far below and that of another mountain on the other side. It struck us that we’d be going right back up there next. The highlight of today had to be Harriman State Park. After picking our way down a vertical boulder wall known as Agony Grind—a pretty good clue about how we felt about that particular part of the trail—and crossing over I-87, we started up the mountain we had indeed seen earlier from our viewpoint. Unlike Agony Grind, the ascent was much less vertical and instead was a genteel walk up a well-used path through towering trees and oceans of grassy meadows. Island Pond (really a lake to my way of thinking) providing a visual reprieve from all this woodsy stuff. The trail led through “the Lemon Squeezer,” a rock formation passing through a very narrow passage that then goes up a steep rock face, where you will need to use both your hands and your feet. There is also a blue blaze option around the most difficult section. It was tight, but we were carrying a light day pack and could make it through without needing to remove them. Survivor, an older cancer survivor who is hiking to raise awareness for his cause and carrying a large pack festooned with silver Sharpie well-wishes, was ahead of me. A full pack did make squeezing through the rocks exponentially harder to negotiate. This section of the trail in Harriman State Park was the first of the A.T. to be completed, and much of it still follows the original route. At this point, I’m only 30 miles from New York City. Dysfengshunal and I had a date with our shuttle that we now had to hurry to make. We rushed through some granite tableaux where the trail leveled off, but then had a few more pointless ups and downs to hike before reaching our ride back to the motel. Too tired to walk the short distance into town for dinner that night, we instead ordered in and got laundry done. I guess I was pretty hungry because that large calamari appetizer went down way too easily. So did the loaded hamburger. And the salad.","Bellvale, NY/Greenwood Lake, NY

Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538086,"About three weeks ago, it appeared possible that I'd be able to attend the second annual Northern Forest Canoe Trail weekend Freshet Fest. The NFCT is a 740-mile long water trail that I thru-paddled in 2011. The trail begins in the Adirondacks in Old Forge, New York and ends at the U.S./Canadian border in Fort Kent, Maine. Over the years, I’ve kept in touch with a number of NFCT paddlers, including a few who have also thru-hiked the AT. (And excuse me for a moment while I give a high-five and shout out to Miss Daisy/Team Moxie, who are partially a reason why I’m hiking today. Woot! Woot!)Another of these colleagues is 2009 thru-hiker and 2012 thru-paddler, Country Runner. He conveniently lives in New Jersey and was planning to attend this year's event. All I needed to do was remain within an area where he could easily pick me up en route to Saranac Lake. Obviously, slack packing for three days from the motel in Greenwood Lake, N.Y. was completely logical. IMO.Friday morning, my paddling/hiking/shuttler, his wife and another paddling friend met me at Anton’s on the Lake. My zero weekend included a lunch stop at Lake George with 50,000 – 100,000 of our closest biker-rally friends, an entertaining 2015 thru-paddling trip presentation, food, reuniting and meeting up with other thru-paddlers, paddling, more presentations and more food. I also got my haircut. In short, I had a blast and am getting used to very short hair. In hindsight however, maybe I shouldn't have been the hairdresser's next client after that man. She still had the neck razor out.Bonus: My foot has had a chance to rest. We'll see how the plantar fasciitis liked that.","Harriman State Park/Greenwood Lake, NY

Mountain laurels are in full explosion. Whole hillsides are laden with shrubs thick with white or pink flowers. I had sent a resupply and was now carrying six or more days worth of food. I hiked only a short distance to the first shelter and had already decided to tent tonight. Good call. The shelter was populated with three chain-smokers, one of whom was a dead ringer of the Meth/Abortion Clinic hoodie-wearing girl from Orange is the New Black. The meth couple were also rocking out to 80s music on the portable radio they carried, because of course, nothing sounds more like nature than a little Twisted Sister. They are heading south. While cooking up one of my heaviest non-artisan dinners, a satisfying chicken-flavored TVP rice concoction, one of the fellows I was camping near suddenly noted a bear just yonder. And by just yonder, I mean close. The small yearling (?) nosed around another fire pit, looked at the four of us taking pictures and videos, then headed toward the shelter which was now populated with more hikers, none of which appeared to be additional meth heads. The bear sighting generated more interest in sleeping in the shelter, smokers or not. We were also much more vigilant about hanging our food, toothpaste and anything that remotely smelled delicious, even if it is packaged in plastic. That means my peppermint Aveda Foot Relief lotion is hanging from a tree tonight. And I mean it, I better not lose yet another food resupply to a bear. Prior to my departure, there had been lots of well-intentioned advice about safety, including encounters with fearsome bears. Yet, none of us reached for pepper spray or guns (if anyone was even carrying), during this entire encounter. Cuz that’s how we hikers roll. Meth or not. Meanwhile, I need not worry about being jolted awake by the sound of snapping twigs caused by the footfalls of curious bears. The only snapping twigs (and branches) I'm hearing are those being torn asunder from the trees by gusting wind. That's white noise to me.","Saranac Lake, NY

And even though crows were cawing, it was the guy next to me deflating his Therm-o-rest air mattress that got me up. At 5:30. But I still managed to be one of the last people to leave. At 8. Mornings tend to be my best writing time, so I'm not trying too hard to be out by a certain time. That might change as the days get hotter and hiking in the early morning becomes more appealing. My plantar fasciitis foot pain does seem to be lessening. I’ve done a combination Ibroprophen, ice, stretching and tape, none of which has been applied consistently. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being unmedicated childbirth, it's mostly an overall level 2-3 dull throb. I still receive the occasional level 3-4 stabbing jolt due to a poorly placed foot on a poorly placed protruding rock. I've also been experiencing a secondary foot issue—strain on the top of that same bastard left foot. This is due to the ankle to shin-high rocks that one routinely needs to clear while lifting one’s foot over them. Occasionally the brain gives the foot the all clear message, when clearly it's not. In this situation the top of the foot gets smacked against the rock in mid-stride resulting in an unpleasant stretching sensation. It's not bad when it happens once, but when you've done this many times, each resmacking of the errant foot hurts like the dickens. Especially when you are already compensating for the hurting plantar. But enough about my aches and pains, sonny.Today was another first. Unlike Pepsi and Poptarts, this one is a bit more in character for me. I listened to iTunes. It was a first because up until now, I had yet to plug into my music while hiking. And why today? Because New York took a page from Maryland’s playbook and led us over a ridge, back down the ridge, then back up said ridge. Oh and Pennsylvania threw up a bunch of rocks all over the trail again today. This is getting to be so repetitious. And tedious. And irksome. But the weather is again pretty perfect. I'm a member of a few Appalachian Trail Facebook Groups. Among other things, the topic of music and playlists was discussed pre-trip. There were lots of tunes being suggested that I had never heard of, and for some kiddos, I'm certain the same would be true. Plus my taste is more of the D-minor melancholy chord—not the kind that gets you psyched up for climbing over puked up boulder gardens. I had forgotten that I had downloaded a bunch of new songs before I left including a cover of the Stones “Wild Horses” by The Sundays. This reminded me of the music history quizzes I’d give my kids whenever we heard an iconic song. Usually the answer was limited to a choice between the Beatles or the Stones. (You're welcome children!) In addition the The Sunday's, my new uploads include music by the artists Damien Jurado, Jose Gonzalez, Joni Mitchell, Sufjan Stevens and Horse Feathers. And Lay Down by Melanie. I had that song stuck in my head one day and Googled her. If you want to revisit the heady late sixties, before things like digital animation, the Ken Burns effect or even color was a thing, look up that song on YouTube. I can promise you a special effect using a lava lamp. But I digress…I also bopped along to a little Ellis Paul and Old Crow Medicine Show’s version of Wagon Wheel. Not that will keep one foot moving in front of the other. Unless your brain miscalculates and you smack the top of it on a rock. Another reason I listened to music for the first time is because I’m finally figuring out tricks to conserve my phone battery. I still keep it on airplane mode most of the time, but who knew all the crap Apple has running in the background that can be turned off with no ill effects. I suspect a conspiracy. My battery only drained 5% listening to music, taking pictures and writing notes for these posts today. Today's jaunt passed by a lot more of those rock walls. In the middle of the woods. I'm in New York now, and I don't think slavery existed here (did it?), so I can only conclude this is the rock-picking busywork foisted on farmstead children. Or indentured servants. I also ran into “Body” again today, but he wasn't at all happy to see me seeing as I started a good half hour after he did heading north. When we met, he was heading south. He had taken a break at the top of a mountain and accidentally started heading in the wrong direction. For a mile. I'm now tenting at the free AT campsite at Fahnestock State Park. The campground is near, but out of sight of Canopus Lake. What my site is near, however, is some kind of very busy highway. The AWOL guidebook only shows us a linear line and landmarks where the trail crosses, so I have no clue what that highway is. Right. Next. To. Me. Or why a campground would be sandwiched next to it in the first place. It's like sleeping in your backyard if your backyard abuts a freeway. What this park does have going for it are the hot showers. But that is about it. It is slightly off trail. In fact, I took a ride from the Route 301 where the trail emerged from the woods, shortening my day by two miles. My ride was the mom of a hiker who has been slack packing all this week. Unlike my measly 17 mile slacker day, her daughter is doing 25 to 35 mile days. Oh to be young again, eh? Finally, I learned something new—and it’s somewhat disturbing. One of my lunch staples is pepperoni. It doesn't need refrigeration (despite what the package states) and I roll it up in tortillas with cheese. Silly me, I checked out the calories and serving suggestions. Did you know that a 140 calorie serving consists of only six slices? Each of my two tortillas had triple that amount. Good thing I don't really like pepperoni off trail. Musings: I'm still not getting this all-day hiking mentality. A lot of people (young and old alike) get up early, hike all day—well into dusk sometimes—eat, are in bed by 8 p.m. and do it all over again the next day. Some do it just to put on miles, maybe due to time constraints), others just because they can. I feel a little envious, yet I don't think I want to aspire to this same behavior. There is nightly and/or morning socializing, but I don't see people doing anything else, like reading or writing. It also seems weird to be the last one leaving camp in the morning and we aren't talking noon. It messes with my head, like I'm running late. Gotta get to Katahdin, stat!","Graymoor Monastary, NY

Instead I headed to the east end to pick up the trail at mile marker 1438.8, missing two miles along the ridge paralleling Canopus Lake, but hiking at least .8 miles or more to get there. Still, its not “official” AT mileage, so my cumulative total will still be short.The trail today was fantastic. Like I expect a trail to be. Some rocks, some roots, but mostly smooth sailing. A 1.5 mile section between Hosner Mountain Road and NY 52 was particularly charming. The trail maintainer built cairns and edging along the switchbacks and dabbed white dot blazes on some of the trail rocks in a non-ATC conforming (white rectangle) manner. It was not only smooth, but aesthetically pleasing and is one of my favorite parts of the trail thus far. Could be because the day was so nice to boot. Stopped for a look at the RPH Shelter and discovered I had missed some trail magic last night while voluntarily choosing to be stuck next to the freeway. Apparently someone provided a cookout for the hikers staying there that night. And the unimposing shed was really a very nice shelter.Turns out the freeway I camped next to last night is the Taconic State Thruway. The trail paralleled it for most of the day today. I finally put in my earbuds and listened to music for a second day in a row, but this time because the drone of the traffic was the nuisance. The trail eventually crossed under that and over I-84. Took a long lunch break on a view overlooking a farm in the valley below above Hosner Mountain Road on the other side of the ridge where the traffic was less of an auditorial assault of the senses. No one else was at the shelter when I arrived and I considered cooking dinner, then attempting a few more miles. The mosquitos were a little on the bad side. As I was cooking, Johnny Cash arrived. I know, weird isn't it? I had been reading the quiet vegetarian’s reflective shelter journal entries for the past few weeks and had only just met him a few days earlier at Antons. Around dusk, another fellow arrived huffing and puffing after his first day back on the trail. Based upon his constantly bouncing knee, his talk about how this year’s Trail Days was so lame compared to last year’s hospitalizations and arrests and stories of how his 2015 bong-wielding companion got stares from 80-year old RVers (you think?), me thinks there was some huffing and puffing happening well before he stepped foot on the trail. The upcoming miles of the trail crosses roads and passes by Nuclear Lake. That sounded nice, the lake part, not the nuclear. I googled it to see if there might be any camping restrictions. In 1958, the area was home to a nuclear fuel testing site. In 1972 there was a plutonium spill, but in 1975 the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission declared it fit for instructed use. (NYTimes, March 24, 1986.) So, yeah. I think I stay put here tonight in spite of our wired party-seeking shelter mate.","Frahnestock State Park, NY

A mere two days ago, I mused about the presumably crazy mindset of hikers who hike from dawn to dusk. Um, guilty.My plan was to make Kent, Conn., in two days in order to a) stay somewhere with soap and b) pick up my next food drop. I had been in touch with a B&B just outside of town who could even pick me up south of Kent (within reason) without a shuttle charge. I misread a sign near the RPH shelter stating the Connecticut state line was 26.9 miles, a reasonable two day goal. However, the village of Kent was another 11.5 miles beyond the border. Not so reasonable. I decided to get up early, forego using the stove (meaning no coffee) and get on the trail faster. And by early and faster, for me that meant 6:45ish, after a 5:15 alarm. Curse you Facebook! I don't think I'll ever do that again—leave camp without coffee—or a real breakfast, that is. Besides the humidity I immediately felt, there was no fuel in the tank. I trudged my way up over some rocks swatting at mosquitos and gnats and could not fathom hiking my intended 16.6 mile day. First I starting hoping for trail magic in the form of coffee (a total pipe dream). Then I kept scheming about roads where the B&B people could pick me up earlier and earlier. Finally, I decided to unpack the stove and take a real coffee break after 5.6 miles at Nuclear Lake. Nuclear Lake was very scenic. And showed signs of life. There were normal looking mallards hanging out around normal looking aquatic plants. If there had been an Adirondack chair sitting under the bug-free white pines atop the granite bluff where I could read my book and drink coffee all day, I'd likely still be there, damn the plutonium! Instead I texted my husband about my woes, drank my instant black instant coffee (which tasted remarkably fantastic sans the usual creamer) and cooked up some ramen noodles. There were even some encouraging texts from hikers up the trail with campsite and hostel recommendations when I turned on my phone for said whiny husband text. Trail yin and yang. I looked ahead to my next break after 5.3 miles at Native Landscapes at the Appalachian Trail train station stop near Pawling, NY. I briefly had considered a visit to NYC to see my sister-in-law who lives in Brooklyn. I even contacted her without any prior warning and it would have been possible. Lots of hikers leave the trail for a day or more to visit the city and I still had this option open. But the trail. Was. Easy! Flat. Scenic. Caffeinated. I had no problem making it to the landscape center/AT supporter who offers showers, free camping and sells snacks, cold beverages and ICE CREAM (in addition to nice plants and landscape design.) The 16.6 mile shelter now seemed possible—and maybe even the next one that is located another four miles, by a river. All depends on the trail. The carrot that was drawing me to the Ten Mile River campsite was a river. A river in which I could potentially swim. Many shelters, at least the ones I’ve passed, seem to be deliberately positioned along the trail for lack of a view. Or even the merest trickle of a spring. A real river meant I could rinse off the accumulated bug spray, bug guts and sweat.While I was contemplating getting my third ice cream, a sectional SOBO entered the store. I asked him about the upcoming trail conditions to which he reported he didn't think the section was well-maintained compared to the parts he had hiked in Vermont. Well you can give me half a dozen downed trees and thigh-high, poison-ivy edged field weeds anytime over rocks. If this guy thinks that section of the trail was bad, he is soon in for a very rude awakening. I flew over this trail as much as is possible for me—which always seems to average1.5 - 2 mph regardless of the conditions. There were numerous instances of trail magic, all of which I was too late to receive…except…. Dinner! After passing the shelter at 16.6 miles, I decided to wait to eat my dinner at the Connecticut state line putting me only three miles away from the Ten Mile River campsite. And what should I find there? Two coolers full of food and drinks. (Thanks Croc ‘n Rolls parents!) Thus I ate my words—along with a corn-chickpea salad, chips and the most delightful cellophane-entombed Sara Lee pudding cake—all washed down with the second Pepsi consumed since high school. And the campsite delivered. I floated in the shallow depths of the Housatonic River before falling asleep, cleaner, to its lovely white noise.","Morgan Stewart Shelter, NY

I slept great last night. Wish that would have translated into a great day, but alas. I had a few “issues.” I “only” had 8.5 miles to hike today, eight of which—for lack of a better term—sucked. I slept in until 7 this morning. I took my time, made coffee, made a complicated egg thing. I was liking the sunlight and the river and the lack of bugs and was busy writing when a former thru-hiker and trail rat came calling. The next hour was spent trying to pack up while an evangelizing, pot-smoking apocalyptic tried to convince me that Barack (HUSSEIN) Obama and (Argentinian COMMUNIST) Pope Francis were biblically foreshadowed. Wait. I’m the one that should worry about false prophets? It was pretty obvious that we shared very different world views. And, however you feel about smoking weed, 9 a.m. strikes me as being more than a wee bit early for that kind of activity. I headed out as he tucked into his second bowl. 
One thing I did follow, thanks to my pot-smoking prophet, was a blue blaze to the Bulls Bridge covered bridge. The AT veers away and misses it completely. I was heading to the nearby country store for a second breakfast when who should find me but the slack packer mom who gave me a lift to the Fahnestock State Park two days earlier. Her week spent with her daughter was over and she was taking the scenic way back home. So that was a good thing that happened today. She offered me another ride, but no. Silly me, I “only” had less than eight more miles to do. 
At this point, I should mention that the first mile following the river was very nice. And probably the next .3. Then we headed up. And down. And over rocks. And over more rocks. And then really up before heading down. Over rocks. I honestly think someone just painted arbitrary white blazes on random trees over boulder fields. In at least two places south of Kent, those EKG’s of hills even surpassed Pennsylvania’s lowest low. IMO. I used this time to be both annoyed with the trail and annoyed at how I can't seem to be more forceful about keeping monopolizing people from intruding upon my own sacred time and place. 
On the other hand my foot has been better and I haven't medicated the past three days. I also was passed by two NOBO women wearing skirts like me and we took selfies. So more good stuff.
Then I arrived in Kent. I made a trip into town because a) there was ice cream and b) I had sent a food resupply box and had Ft. Montgomery forward my bounce box containing my other shoes, sunscreen, new socks, clean clothes—basically stuff I was really looking forward to finally needing after weeks of bouncing it. The food was here. The bounce box was not. Tracking shows it went to Jersey City, NJ, White Plaines, NY, back to Jersey City, Springfield, MA, again back to Jersey City, and is currently again in Springfield. The nice local post office person doesn't know why. Grrrrrr. 
After calling the B&B for a pick-up, I downed a milkshake, followed by a lavender (sensible single scoop) cone that should have been good. Yet, I barely tasted either during my overall postal angst. Let's see what tomorrow brings.","Ten Mile River Shelter, NY

Today was nothing like yesterday. During my formative teenage years, a young Sally Fields, wanting to break out from her saccharine roles as “Gidget” and the “Flying Nun,” starred in the NBC made for TV movie “Sybil.” This was back in the day when there were only three major networks, plus public broadcasting, and no cable. Like HBO and Netflix today, networks would occasionally produce their own programs. Movies like Brian’s Song, Born Innocent and Tribes became our weekly crack, sort of like the Walking Dead is to this generation.Sybil was based on a book about a young woman who suffered from split personalities or dissociative identity disorder. One was suicidal, another was a pre-verbal infant, a third is a gifted pianist. And poor Sybil doesn't know when the other personalities will manifest themselves. On any given day. At any given time. The AT is Sybil and Route 341 created a personality split just outside of Kent, Conn.South of Route 341 was full of ankle-twisting rocks and a totally pointless trek up to a viewless peak while today’s northern route had us following the Housatanic River. All day. From a scenic ridge line to a smooth five-mile long riverside path. Okay so there was one death-defying descent after the St. John ledges, and by death-defying I mean to say a boulder scramble with few steps shorter than the length of your leg bone and covered with leaf litter and pine needles for upping the risk factor. And, yeah, I almost fell carrying a new food resupply at one point (near the bottom). But really, that was it. The flatness and relatively root- and rock-free personality of today’s trail was quite the contrast to Sybil yesterday. Camped out at Silver Hill tonight—word was that this campsite was a nice one and boy did it deliver. An absolutely beautiful spot surrounded by towering white pines complete with a covered picnic pavilion, deck and swing. Yesterday’s two skirted sister hikers had spent the morning in town and arrived here at the campsite after I did. As did about a dozen high school kids out on a five-day trip. I had passed them twice today at the two Housatanic River overlooks and was surprised to see that they made it this far. Meaning the distance they covered—although I did observe that they all seemed to have made it down that St. John descent without injury as well. A very nice group, and by nice I mean exhausted and quiet. Spending the remaining hours sitting on the swing as a full moon rose. Today also brought me past the 600 mile mark. Woot! Woot!

There were many changes in elevation, so ultimately it wasn't the easiest day of hiking---especially in the afternoon heat. At the end of the day I knew there was a hostel awaiting. Besides clean sheets and showers, the Bearded Woods includes a family dinner and breakfast. And laundry. Two things occurred just before the end of my hike. First, I ran into a ridge runner named “Roadrunner.” Ridge runners are seasonal employees of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy or one of the regional chapters, who routinely hike and monitor specific sections of the trail. They might assist with first aid or they might kick you out of an area where you aren't supposed to be camping. I had shared a shelter with Roadrunner about a month ago, right before heading in to Port Clinton, PA. He had told me then that he'd be working in Massachusetts and I had completely forgotten. And we were also in Connecticut, but as he explained, he is one of four ridge runners covering both Massachusetts and Connecticut. Second, the trail magic we had heard about yesterday ended up being parked at the road crossing at the end of today's hike.

Today was warm, but the trail was really nice as defined by “scenic.” Lots of streams. Lots of vistas. A nice variety of trail conditions. There was only one vertical double black diamond drop after passing the highest point of the AT in Connecticut, on another Bear Mountain, noted in the guidebook only as “steep and rocky.”The highlight of the day was definitely the Sages Ravine area. The trail follows a stream for almost .5 miles and there are pools where you can swim amidst the emerald moss-covered stony bluffs. There were many little water falls cascading as the stream dropped in elevation through the ravine and a picturesque stream-side hiker campground. Except for feeling sweaty, I was feeling real good hiking 16.5 miles, even with the death march down the “steep and rocky” north face of Bear Mountain. But I did feel like swimming. I figured a quick dip would wash off the day’s sweat, sun screen and accumulated dirt, plus give me that extra kick to make it to the next campground, another 1.3 miles ahead. Well kick it did. I believe that water was still winter runoff. It was cold enough to make me gasp—and that's saying a lot for me. But I felt great and not even much sweatier by the time my tent was pitched and dinner eaten two hours later. I went to put my food bag in the bear box and took a look at the Campsite Trail Register. Turns out that the only other campground occupant is also from Wisconsin. It's day one of his month-long section hike. He's been working his way north for the past nine years. I think I'm happier to be doing this all at one time. I give the section hikers a lot of credit. It's much harder to constantly start over each year. Just when their trail legs are all tuned up, they have to head back home. Oh, and another state down. I passed into Massachusetts late this afternoon.","Bearded Woods Hostel

High 80s, almost 90, sunnyDinner: Thanksgiving on the Trail, Creamy Tomato Soup, BeerHikers: Five day hikers, passed by five NOBOs, Dysfengshunal Another beautiful day…and interesting trail following the Taconic range. I liked the morning very much. The afternoon, not so much. After leaving camp, the trail traversed piney woods to Race Mountain. The summit provided spectacular views along slabs of smooth bedrock for quite a distance. Each view seemed more dramatic than the last. All good things come to an end, and I started down the first of several steep descents so of the day. Vertical descents, worn even smoother by thousands of boots. Just like yesterday's Bear Mountain. Then I went up Mt. Everett, not to be confused with its more famous Tibetan cousin, Everest. Another nice view above scrub oaks and pines and the site of a former fire tower. The another death-defying trek downwards. This was beginning to become irksome. From then on, the trail continued to follow broken rocky fields. At one point I felt like I was walking in a dry stream bed. The scenery was still stunning and the bugs still haven't been bad, but am getting pretty sick of walking on rocks. The final descent out of the range toward South Egremont, Mass., was a long switchback of more balancing acts, careful foot placements and scootching downward. To be clear, this is my style. I am being very cautious and careful. Meanwhile younger, more agile hikers with lots of shock-absorbing spongy cartilage still nesting their kneecaps, bound past me. One Croc-clad young man initially startled me, not only because he was hiking barefoot in his Crocs, but because he was only wearing shorts. Today is Naked Hiker Day. “Oh!” I said, startled. “For a moment I thought you were observing Naked Hiker Day,” which he hadn't even heard about. Myself? I was alone most of the day and an organized observance strikes me as being more of a group, albeit very personal, experience. It certainly would be more disturbing for a poor day hiker to come upon a solo naked hiker sans clothes for no apparent reason.Before the trip, people would caution me about traveling alone—primarily concerned regarding stranger danger. If you only saw where I'm hiking, one would be much more concerned about me falling. So I take it slow. I also wouldn’t want anyone to have to deal with my broken body if I did fall. That would ruin both of our days. I’d been chasing Dysfengshunal all day and finally caught up to her sitting at the bottom of the interminable switchback chatting it up with half-dressed, bounding Croc lad. We hiked the next four flat miles toward Sheffield, where we are resting our feet, recharging our devices and camping at a trail angels house. Musings: I like canoeing.","Laurel Ridge Tentsite, MA

It's really a cabin. On a lake. With canoes. 15 bunks upstairs and a living area downstairs. The caretakers make pancakes for breakfast. I got here by 2 p.m., but today wasn't easy. Not sure if it was because I took Benadryl last night to offset all those mosquito bites, or because yesterday’s hike was hard on my feet and body or because whenever I think I have a shorter day, I mentally check out, but for whatever reason I was glad to be done hiking today. I went for a swim in the lake with all my clothes on, thereby accomplishing a light rinse cycle at the same time. Took one of the canoes out with another hiker who has been fishing on occasion. Bear Gryls brought a spool of line and a hook and I paddled about the lake while he tried to lure in a lunker using his bare hands. The bunkhouse was full and the mood was one of being at summer camp, but with beer. Or at least beer that wasn't considered contraband. This week's caretakers brought hotdogs and drinks. People hung around the campfire. On the front porch. Goofing around in the canoes after dark. I scored a single bed by a window and could smell the last embers of the campfire ebbing. People wandered into the dark bunkhouse lit only by the red light mode of their headlamps. It was a wild group, but by 9:45 p.m., quiet. Musings: I had my music going today to help get those miles done. Joni Mitchell was lamenting how she’s been waiting three hours for her boyfriend to arrive (Car On The Hill).

When I swim laps, I generally do 36 to 72 at a time and I count them. Sometimes I get lost in the moment and the time just flies by. I'll lose track of the number and feel like I could swim forever. Other times I count. Every. Single. Lap. I count down to the time when I can be done. Unlike some of my other days, I got lost in the moment hiking from Cheshire to the summit of Mt. Greylock. It was cooler, less humid and the air was filled with the scent of sun-warmed pine. The trail was loamy and meandered through ridge pole pines. And it lacked one significant feature: rocks. There was none of this “chose your own adventure” crap where the trail tries to kill you. One of my iTunes downloads is “A Soft Place To Land” by Kathleen Edwards. The chorus goes, “I’m looking for a soft place to land. The forest floor. The palm of your hands.” Usually when this song cycled through, I was picking my way through some hellish rock field and I’d think; “Right. Try landing here sweetheart!” But today, that chorus finally rang true—at least while I was traipsing through the Christmas trees and sphagnum moss.I arrived at the summit of Mt. Greylock as clouds started building. Visited the historic Bascom Lodge and called my parents before heading six miles back down to North Adams. Either the sunlight and pretty pine trees clouded my perception of the morning’s section or the afternoon was really more challenging. The first three miles seemed to take forever, followed by what appeared to be mile long descent straight down. The final mile and a half finally changed to more forgiving switchbacks. Maybe the trail maintainers just haven't finished getting all the switchbacks installed, but land sakes! That was hard—on the knees, on the toes, on the brain.I was in charge of dinner tonight. I ordered pizza. Musings: People come and go while you are hiking the trail. A friendship may last only a single day. You may cross paths down the road or never see them again. Except on Facebook. You might hike just for an afternoon or share a shelter overnight intensely talking about life in general or politics in specific. Or you might spend days or weeks with a person or group sharing stories and motels rooms. On the other hand, you might have a lifetime of friendships. My husband and I first met Becky and David more than 30 years ago while attending college in central Wisconsin. They lived a few houses away from us, but we didn't meet them until spring only after we both emerged from our winter cocoons carrying our first borns in baby Bjorns. Their son and our daughter arrived just a month apart that year. Even though they moved to North Adams nine months after we met, we've stayed in touch. David’s work kept him away during my visit, but being able to spend this much time with Becky sort of felt like we were back in college. Except we were living in a really nice house. And not eating ramen. Or at least one of us isn't eating that college staple over these four days. And there was no Poly-Sci exam to cram for on Monday.

I told her that I didn't really need the cookies, but what the heck, I took them anyway. She dropped me off at the trailhead on her way to work. Within minutes I was dripping. It was so muggy even the rocks were sweating. Within the hour, the cookies were the first thing I ate. The incline out of North Adams started out much more gently than the descent coming down out of Mt. Greylock. In general the trail running through Massachusetts has been pleasant and interesting. But then less than two miles from the Vermont border, it threw up one last 200’ high boulder scramble. It was infinitely easier (for me) to climb up than crawl down. And then I was in Vermont. Vermont is also known as “Vermud” and it was true. Vermont seems to route the trail through springs. Almost from the minute I crossed the border, the trail had soft muddy spots—more than any other section thus far. Or if other states had muddy sections, they were cleverly disguised under boardwalks. Just kidding Vermont. I've seen some planks. The weather forecast predicted rain this afternoon and storms tonight, but so far nothing. Still, I am staying in the shelter and sharing it with a brother and sister from NYC who are doing a long-distance section. I expected it to be buggy, but it's better in here than outside. There is a decent sized stream here, way more than a trickle. I found a secluded spot and rinsed off all the sweat in a calf-deep pool.My left foot was feeling better until I changed out shoes yesterday.

The rain stopped around 5 a.m.Today was a tough one. It didn't help that I did some writing first before heading out around 9:30 a.m. But the elevation changes were insane. The trail dipped more than 1200 feet including a 958 feet straight down “staircase” only so we could cross Route 9 before climbing right back up to 1269 feet. It took me four hours to hike six miles. Going down is so much harder for me and my knees. Hiking uphill makes be feel strong and powerful. Downhill makes me feel old and unstable. There was a pretty creek with a closed footbridge. Apparently it was deemed safer for hikers to either ford or rock hop. Even the creek’s namesake (Hell Hollow) feel the same way about the area. Not much else to say except that everyone here at the shelter agreed this was a tough section. Even the speedy NOBOs. At least the cool breezes kept both the sweat and the bugs at bay. And tonight's shelter is a nice one, one of the best things about today. Nice woodwork. Cool breeze. Good view. Tiny, but clear and cold spring.Update: We heard that a hiker broke her femur coming down that staircase near Rte. 9 a few days before I traversed that section.

Was on the trail by 7:15. Hiking uphill is so less taxing first thing in the morning. Last night it seemed liked the shelter would never appear. This morning, no problemo hiking up to the fire tower and climbing it. The view was gorgeous in the morning sun. Today was a big day. Last weekend I learned that my husband was planning on surprising me with a visit this coming weekend. I was starting to get suspicious sounding texts culminating with an oddly specific date question. Even though I ruined the surprise of having him suddenly show up, I was still beyond thrilled to learn of his scheming ways. It also ensured that I would be where I said I'd be, which tends to be extremely difficult to plan more than a few days out. This current section of Vermont spans two wilderness sections and is more or less roadless. I had to hike more than 19 miles today in order to have a less challenging rendezvous day tomorrow. While long and ultimately tiring, today was less challenging than yesterday. There were more views, several ponds—and with one notable exception—less severe elevation changes. I kept leapfrogging with Rootbeard and Jeremy throughout the day and we all ended up at the same shelter that night. I will admit, however, that after hiking the final three miles up to the Stratton Mountain summit, at 5 p.m., the inspirational brass for AT visionary Benton MacKaye was lost on me. I just wanted to hike the final 2.8 miles down to the shelter and be done with the day. On AWOL’s map, Stratton Mountain rises from the surrounding landscape like a single 3936’ high breast. I fear I didn't take advantage of discussing much with Jean, one of the caretakers living in the remote cabin at the summit. Black flies, those little piranhas of the north woods, were out in force for the first time that I've noticed so far on this hike. I almost didn't even climb up the fire tower where our “view” was located, if not for Rootbeard. He was still checking his messages when I arrived imploring me that this was the reason the trail lead here in the first place. I’ll tell you: It's quite different thinking about spending the effort to enjoy a view at the beginning vs. the end of a day. Arrived at the newer Stratton Pond Shelter, incidentally not actually located on the pond, around 7 p.m. Got dinner started and walked the .3 miles to the pond where I attempted to discourage a busy beaver to move on so I could swim. I vaguely recall a story years ago about someone once being mauled by an aggressive beaver. Or was it an otter? Regardless, I was hell bent to swim. And swim I did in the warm pond waters. And the loons did sing. And all was right with the world once again. Except for my throbbing toes. A little Ibuprofen made them alright too.","Goddard Shelter, VT

Funny how a good nights sleep and something like a visit from your beloved changes your perception of things. Stopped for lunch at the Spruce Peak Shelter, only 2.8 miles out from Manchester Center and checked in to see where Sam was located. Stuck in traffic. I had time to kill, he was still a few hours away. Spruce Peak Shelter was, I think, one of the original Long Trail shelters. Constructed of logs, it is one of the few that has a working wood stove inside between the bunks. Like the Congdon Shelter, it has windows, but Spruce Peak also had a sliding door. Well I found all of this interesting.When I finally heading to the Route 11/30 rendezvous point at the parking area, I ran into Uncle Stash. He had visited Mass MOCA while taking a zero in North Adams too. We rehashed the point of all the work we had seen and before I knew it, the sounds of the highway got louder and there was Sam turning into the parking lot exactly as I reached the road.

Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541115,"Sam really managed to pull off a slam dunk of a weekend, complicated only by the logistics of finding me within a relatively roadless area. Until the texts turned suspicious, Sam had employed the help of several New England friends in an attempt to surprise me with a visit. For the record, I usually figure out my presents before Christmas morning too. So here's the thing. Trails do connect people in addition to places. I have a trail family, a tramily, of sorts. They just aren't AT hikers. Yet. Oh, I have phone numbers for more than few hikers with whom I've spent time, but our paces or time off the trail has prevented us from hanging together for longer periods of time. And maybe we become true tramily post-trip, through our shared experiences and memories of time when our days—or weeks—did overlap.I first “met” Chris, Russ, Sandy and others living here in the Northeast as I began planning my 2011 thru-paddle of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail (NFCT) through Facebook and emails. We eventually got to meet in person, confirming that we weren't 13-year old girls pretending otherwise, and that we really did look like our profile pics. Well most of us. Turns out Russ isn't really a sheep.Then there are folks I've met since that year who have also gone on to paddle the NFCT. People like Laurie (NFCT 2015), who hiked ten miles with me the first week back in the Shenandoahs and Dan (NFCT 2013), who along with his wife Michelle, own the Swift House Inn in Middlebury, Vermont and put us up (or put up with us) this weekend. The Freshet Fest that I attended a few weekends ago in Saranac Lake, New York, along with the help of Mark (AT 2009 and NFCT 2012), reunited many of us—and apparently at that time they all knew about Sam’s scheming ways. They kept the secret and were working hard on convincing me to attend a summer party being held at the sheep’s house in Northern Vermont, a good two hours or more away from the nearest point on the AT.I was still thrilled with my surprise visit. Sam and I spent two relaxing nights at the beautiful Swift House Inn and there is nothing like a soaking in a hot whirlpool bath to help you appreciate being off trail more. Well maybe some good food—which also featured predominantly in the weekend visit. We hit the local farmer’s market, did some early Christmas shopping and just for fun, checked out the local real estate market. (Note to friends and relatives back in Wisconsin—we were only window shopping…)On Sunday, we headed to the summer party, visiting additional friends and their significant others. Patty gave me an awesome foot massage and we stayed up well past hiker midnight with more good food, conversations, music, bonfires and fireflies.

Clearly life-changing. I first stayed at Grey Gables in 2011 and again two years ago when I was back repaddling a section. Sam had arranged for our stay as part of my surprise. This was my third time, and Sam’s second, staying at the Grey Gables Mansion Inn in Richford, Vermont. Proprietors Tim and Debbie produced another of their hearty breakfasts. Turns out two 2016 NFCT thru-paddlers, father and son—Stuart and Lyle—had arrived yesterday late afternoon while we were out. Over breakfast, we talked all things canoeing. And a little hiking too. They had done the John Muir last year. And then we headed out to rejoin our respective trails—they portaging through town and me back to Route 11/30 Manchester Center area parking lot where Sam had found me three days earlier. I repacked a few groceries. We shared a beer. While we were finishing lunch and getting ready to give our six-week-until-we-see-each-other-again parting embraces, two young women approached us looking for a ride into town. Having that distraction at least delayed my reaction to Sam’s departure. Sort of like having a happy little oblivious granddaughter around when you have to say goodbye to a canine companion of more than twelve years. There wasn't time or a place for any long tearful goodbyes. Today's hike was a paltry three miles up to the summit of Bromley Mountain Ski Hill.

After we were all tucked in last night—at 9 p.m.—one of the section hikers decided to check out the post-sunset view and came back to report that she could see town fireworks rising above the mountaintops and being set off in the valleys below. The ski hut where we were allowed to stay is higher—and farther away. At this height and angle, the fireworks were more in scale to sparklers without any noise. The ski run meadows were full of fireflies providing a more local display.I felt sluggish and took it slow today even though the terrain was not exceptionally taxing. There was a nice little view at Styles Peak and I took a lunch break at the Peru Shelter overlooking a stream, but the fun part of the day was climbing up the exposed rock of Baker Peak. And by fun, I mean I got to go up it on a nice sunny afternoon. Going down would have elicited a different review. My choices today, assuming I was shooting for a shelter, was either going to be an 11.8 mile day or a 16.8 mile day. I was the first to arrive at the Lost Pond Shelter, and even though it was a little early to stop, I thought a nap might be nice. Plus it had a small swimming hole in the adjacent stream where I could take a quick dip before anyone else showed up. Incidentally this is yet another named shelter with no pond in evidence. The nap was going fairly well until a heavy-footed family arrived and made sure the tent spots closest to me were fully and loudly discussed before setting up a little ways away. Nap time being over, I moved on to dinner. Early bed tonight. I’m paying today for staying up “late” to watch the sunset and fireworks last night.","Bromley Ski Hill Summit, VT

Pine trees, streams, ponds, vistas, waterfalls. Everything about today's mileage—actually the past two days of trail—has delivered. I think I have a new favorite part and it's the unnamed section between Little Rock Pond and Greenwall Shelters, near the White Rocks Cliff. The trail passed between towering pine trees, which equates to the forest floor covered in soft pine needles. And there were two areas of cairns. Striking sculptural stone assemblages. I spent a lot of time hanging out at the first one, eating lunch, just sitting and listening to birds. Then I added one too.When the trail wasn't passing through piney woods, it paralleled streams. With waterfalls and swimming holes. Years ago, a friend of mine explained how negative ions are good for you and are present in places like pine forests and waterfalls. Not sure what, if any, science exists for this theory, but there was nothing about today I didn't like. Or make me feel happy to be on the trail. And yeah, there were still roots and rocks, and even a few steep sections, but it all lead to spectacular scenery. And somewhere today I passed my 800 mile mark. I will choose to believe it was by the cairn I built.Only the shelter failed. And I had high expectations for a place with a name like “Minerva.” It lacked a picnic table or any sort of outside cooking area around the firepit. I retain high expectations for my backwood accommodations. But what was just a wee bit more disturbing was the Jeep parked next to several tents. Wait? What? You could drive here?!","Lost Pond Shelter, VT

Tonight's shelter hit a new low and probably not too many steps removed from condemnation. Except this is the AT, and a roofed structure in the middle of the woods, out of the rain, is still considered to be an oasis.Except for expensive gear, finding me in this decaying Poe-like “House of Usher,” you would swear I was homeless. And I felt homeless—wearing the same unwashed clothes for four straight days, smelling bad, feeling damp and sticky. I’m sleeping in a place that is falling apart. The timbers are rotting. The roof leaks. There is broken glass and graffiti. The four bunk beds are tilting every which direction and missing boards. Unthinkably, it even lacks a shelter register. As I write, I hear mice gnawing away at the garbage left in the corner. But it does have a picnic table. And a killer view. And all the stickers, not to mention the ski hill’s directional signage, suggest it doubles in winter as a snow boarder hangout. Dude!At one time, this four-sided stone building was probably a CCC-built jewel. The composting toilet isn't the worst one on the trail and there are new tent platforms and signage here so I’m guessing this shelter is up for renovation or repairs, eventually. It is listed in the guidebook, but in its current state, it can barely manage to house two of us. I ended up here both because the promise of the cozy sounding name, Cooper LODGE, (accommodating 16 people!) and it's location atop of Killington Mountain, near another ski hill. Also, I got caught in a thunderstorm and needed to stop at the next oasis.It was really, really humid and hot today. There were several swimming holes, but the thought of hiking and still being sweaty didn't sway me. The goal today was hitting the Whistle Stop Café, three miles from Minerva. Breakfast all day, ice cream, electricity. I yogi’d a ride from sectional hikers who were waiting for a friend to show up. I mean, I’ll walk hundreds of miles, but don't really want to have to hike an extra half mile—off trail—to a restaurant where I can charge my devices—and eat ice cream. However, I did have to walk on the way back. In the noon hour heat. Uphill. Okay, kidding about that last part. Uphill came once I was back on the trail, of course. The trail followed more beautiful streams through more beautiful piney woods up and over more beautiful views. England and I kept leapfrogging each other throughout the day as did two young women out to hike the Long Trail. That’s another thing that has been interesting—the number of people thru-hiking Vermont’s Long Trail (LT). You can't assume—at all—the thru-hikers at the shelter are on the AT. When asked if one is thru-hiking, there is always this additional question of LT or AT? The weird thing is that there seems to be the same number of people nightly at the shelters, but you’d think there would've be many more with the addition of the LT thru's. But that hasn't been my experience. So where have all the AT thru’s gone? I must be in the middle of another bubble.I met my first true SOBOs today who had started out in Katahdin. A few other passing southbound hikers started in New Hampshire. Like the end of the season, Baxter Park, home to Mt. Katahdin, has restrictions on when people can hike the mountain. They don't allow hikers up until after the snow melts and the spring ice-off, anywhere from late May or by mid-June. SOBOs starting this early have to deal with Maine’s black fly season which also coincides with ice-off.I was more than halfway up Killington, when I heard the first peals of thunder. Usually this late in the day, and knowing I've got a few miles uphill, means I'm trudging. But man, did I start booking it. The trail hugged the mountainside and there was no place to duck out and set up camp. And I was getting nervous about heading to a summit during an impending thunderstorm, but had little choice. The forest around me was nothing but blown down trees which did not suggest protection. The fabulous Cooper Lodge Hovel was still 1.6 miles away when the storm broke. Another trail spur, near the top (which incidentally wasn't ever exposed), was slightly more protected and I pulled out my umbrella and hunkered down. Literally. I assumed the lightning position as a loud strike was almost immediately followed by thunder. There are implications to holding an umbrella, but remaining relatively dry during the deluge outweighed the fear of being a tiny lightning rod among the taller pine trees. The storm passed within 15 minutes and I bolted as best I could through standing water reaching the “lodge” before the next series of storms I expected arrived.And you know how that turned out. I stayed dry only because no other storms came. But the post-storm sunset streaming through the pane-less Cooper Lodge Crackhouse windows was beautiful.","Minerva Hinchley Shelter, VT

Or—what a difference a day makes. Last night I was sticky and staying in a deplorable rat trap. Tonight I’m sleeping in a bed with fine linens after soaking in a scented bath. Last weekend, Dan and Michelle kindly offered to again host me up at their Select Registry inn in Middlebury as I continued up the trail and closer to their fair village. After several days of what I later learned was hiking in 90 degree temps, that offer was looking really good. The deal was sealed after yesterday's thunderstorm, the predicted rain for the next day and a restless night spent avoiding rolling off a deteriorating platform onto broken glass at the Cooper Lodge Graffiti Heap.The reason for staying in the shelter in the first place never materialized over night. The additional storms held off. I had strung up a clothesline but none of my clothes felt any drier despite the light breeze that blew in through the windowless windows all night. The breeze did seem to keep the bugs at bay. Even the resident flies living in the corner trash bag were quiet.But it's all about location, location, location. And that shelter was in one of the best to date. The tent areas were carpeted by pine needles under tall pines or on the new platforms. And again, that view. Waking up to coyotes was a nice bonus. Still, I was happy to be heading to a parking lot where I'd be whisked away to a bed. And running water that was not pouring forth from the sky. Oh! And towels!The trail was drying out as I headed off Killington. Looking at a map tonight, I see that the trail skirted the ski runs, but I never noticed. The six miles down to the parking lot were pleasant, from what I can recall. I was really fixated on meeting Dan on time. While I sat waiting for my trail angel to arrive, one of the day hikers I had passed finished his hike and walked over with a tall cold magical bottle of Snapple ice tea for me. And now I am clean, fed (they made me dinner too) and in a bed. I could get used to this pretty fast.","Cooper Lodge Shelter, VT

The clouds hung low in the mountains nearing Killington and Pico. By the time we arrive at the trailhead it was raining harder. By the time I started hiking, it was more or less pouring. I had my umbrella out but had forgotten to put on the pack cover. What was I thinking? Oh right. I wasn't. Stopped to put it on and, what the heck, let's put the rain kilt on as well. So I ended up staying dry. The rain fell on and off all day. As I only had ten miles with a stop at a trail side lodge to pick up a food drop, I took my time walking along the slick, and at times, flooded trail. In spite of the rain, or maybe because of it, it was beautiful and once again proved that the bright glowing green color of my rain jacket is actually one found in nature. First there was the drop into Gifford Woods State Park. We walked right through the very nice campground. Then the trail crossed over the first little cascade and around Kent Pond. The rain had ceased by the time I stopped at the adjacent lodge to pick up my food. I see that the drop includes the One Pot Taco Dinner I really liked back in Shenandoah. I know what I'm eating tonight. Continued on passing by the thunderously tall Thundering Falls. All this weekend rain likely made it even more spectacular. With the exception of meeting NOBO “Ralphie” (and yes, do think A Christmas Story), who hails from Minnesota, and the SOBOs heading in the opposite direction, I hiked alone all day. It's always a surprise to arrive at a shelter to find it populated and full of conversations. Finally, Stony Brook, another cascading thing of beauty, wins best looking shelter water source to date. Musings: Back in the 90s I either bought or was given the Simple Abundance gratitude journal. It was a popular book for a while. Maybe it still is, I don't know. I did attempt to follow the plan and list daily gratitudes for a year. That lasted all of a few months. But this trip has given me plenty of time to reflect—and more than a few instances to experience gratitude. After the past two weekends, I am feeling extremely grateful for the extraordinary hospitality Dan and Michelle extended to Sam and I last weekend and again to me this weekend. The power of good conversations, great food and a lovely inn setting is incredibly rejuvenating.","Middlebury, VT

Then I got buzzed again. I could hear wings. I didn't wait to confirm just what species I was attempting to identify, it obviously was attempting to move me along. One more dive bomb and I skedaddled holding my trekking poles aloft over my head. Could have been a hawk. Could have been a owl.

Laurie had hiked with me for a day way back in the Shenandoahs, during my first week. We had planned to meet up again in the Whites, but one of us didn't quite make it to New Hampshire just yet. Instead, Laurie met me at the parking area just outside Woodstock, Vermont. Scored a bed and shower in a shared motel room and tomorrow she is joining me for a few days of hiking. Woodstock, by the way, is a very cute and apparently celebrity-driven town, but most hikers likely don't get to see it due to distance from the trail and the somewhat high prices, also likely attributed to the presence of said celebrities.","Stony Brook Shelter, VT

She is sleeping soundly in the cot next to me in this garage space after hiking thirteen miles. I was fully prepared to make it a shorter day and hike just about eight miles to the first shelter, but we arrived there around 2 p.m. and decided to go for the additional 4.7 miles to town. We are staying with four others at a word-of-mouth-only hostel. Actually a room above a garage-like building with all sorts of cast-off couches and mattresses of undetermined age. Or use. Just like best practices in shelters, I have my protective tent ground cloth between my sleeping bag and the sleeping surface—in this instance foam couch cushions instead of slivery wooden planks. Laurie is a strong paddler and just returned from Honduras where she had done some hiking, but still. I do hope she wakes up all refreshed and not crippled. Thirteen miles is awesome—and a long day. My first day hiking on the AT with a fully loaded pack was in the single digits. We'll see what tomorrow brings.Today wasn't exactly easy. We hiked many elevation changes throughout the morning. By afternoon, it was getting warmer, but most of the trail was downhill at the point we decided to continue. We hiked through more lovely pine forests and across several open meadows—some associated with ski runs including a charming one named Suicide Six. The open meadows also had loads of ripe raspberries in which we found the wild tweens grazing. One of the carrots that lured us to this little garage was the rumor of a bridge—a bridge where one might wish to jump. To the river below. While Laurie and I opted not to take our chances dying this way, we did opt to take a swim beneath the bridge. We both agree that if we knew we had a river or lake to jump into at the end of the day, hiking might not be so bad. Which is why we both think paddling a canoe trail is a wee bit nicer.","Rt 12/Woodstock, VT

My mind just wouldn't shut down. At some point, I must have finally fallen asleep, because I found myself waking up, with the protective sheet half off the “bed.”Our host family had coffee going—and breakfast! These folks are allowing hikers to stay on their property, rent a (exceptionally clean) porta-potty, offer cold drinks to hikers passing by, fix them breakfast and only ask for a donation to cover costs, if you feel so inclined. They’ve done this for more than 1300 hikers to date. Except for the heat and humidity—and the constant halo of deer flies—today's hike was less challenging and more social. The trail started off with a climb, but it remained carpeted with pine needles. For added variety, it also passed through three towns, the largest being Hanover, New Hampshire. I entered my tenth state today. Laurie and I were treated to some trail magic as we emerged from the last woods of Vermont—a cooler with watermelon, chocolate-chip banana bread and dog treats. Unfortunately I’ve never developed a taste for watermelon, so I was left with a choice of the remaining two options. The trail follows roadways for almost three miles, crossing over the Connecticut River and the state border and past Dartmouth College before heading up (again!) behind the school’s athletic fields. We took our first long break under a tree in park—looking at clouds, calling home and in general acting like it was the kind of lazy summer afternoon that it really was –although this occurred after walking almost ten miles, the last being more than a mile in the bright sun. Next, we headed to Lou’s Bakery for our free donut, ice tea and air conditioning. Our final stop on the lazy afternoon tour, before heading the last mile to the shelter, was for a late lunch/early dinner at Molly’s. Actually, our final final stop was at a store to refill our water bottles just before heading up to the shelter. The guidebook wasn't clear about the availability of nearby water. I filled up all three of my bottles, then promptly forgot one at the store. Luckily we did bring water as it turns out the water source is located a half mile away after all. And I can easily replace the forgotten water bottle. My brand is Smart Water. A new bottle comes filled with free water. Tonight's shelter is situated within a picturesque pine woods amidst boulders and includes a fine assortment of fellow hikers, one of whom knows (of) me through only three degrees of separation. Walking Mink is the friend of “Gary,” who was in Arizona visiting another set of friends, who happen to live next door to my parents all winter. I had met Gary last March while visiting my parents.

Laurie is a superb writer and chronicles her many travels under her own blog at LauriesAdventures.wordpress.com. Today, we only had less than five miles to hike to her shuttle, so getting up late worked out. I also had the choice of a shelter destination at either 9.5 miles away or 15.2, the second located after a mountain summit and an area the guidebook described as a precipitous ledge. As thunderstorms were predicted to arrive between 2 and 3 p.m., and having already experienced the thrill of being caught in a thunderstorm near the summit of Killington, I opted for a shorter day. It was really humid, again, today. The trail was fairly benign—at least until Laurie’s rendezvous with the shuttle. We hiked the 4.4 miles in two hours and had another hour to kill. Janel, Soft G and Tuna Roll found us lounging by the stream. I’ve been leapfrogging and/or staying with them at shelters since the Bromely ski hut. Laurie and I said our goodbyes and I headed up. It's been great having her on the trail with me. 30ish miles and three days flew by. Not so much the afternoon. Am glad I only had another five miles. There was a brook 2.5 miles away from tonight’s shelter, which was the most reliable water source—at least until the storms came. I contemplated jumping in, and so I did. Even though the remaining miles were mostly uphill, that dip washed away at least one layer of sweat and bug repellent. Arrived at the shelter at the thoroughly unhiker stopping time of 2:30. Tuna Roll, Janel and Soft G were already there. No storm yet. Decided to set up the tent just in case the small shelter would get full of snoring and potentially wet hikers later in the day. Made a fire. Made dinner. Waited for the rain to show up. Waited some more for the rain to show up. And at 6 p.m. the first thunder pealed and rain fell. And then it really fell. Watched the rain pour down in buckets from the shelter and was starting to rethink why I thought it had been a good idea to have pitched the tent. At about the peak of the storm and just after a big crack, three SOBOs did come bolting into the shelter out of the rain. We all hung out waiting for the storm to pass. By 7:30 p.m. it was over. And my tent is still dry. Wish I could say the same about all my sweaty clothes.","Velvet Rocks Shelter, NH

And the morning did go well. Then I stopped at Bill “The Ice Cream Man” Ackerly’s house near Lyme, NH. Bill was famous for handing out ice cream bars to hikers, cold drinks, a game of croquet and letting hikers camp in his yard. He passed away this past May, but his family is still keeping the tradition of free ice cream alive. His house also has wifi and you can charge your phone on his front porch. I spent three hours there. That changed my plans. It was 2:45 when I finally departed the porch chair. I headed only to the next shelter, a cabin by a fire tower, at the top of Smart Mountain. The only problem, besides a steep trail, was the lack of water. It wasn't much fun to carry three liters of extra weight up the mountain for almost four miles. The next water source is another four miles beyond the cabin. What is this? The PCT?I was still feeling that early morning energy even as the sun was beginning to set. The trail led over an open area known as Lamberts Ridge and I seriously considered stealth camping there. It was gorgeous—open vistas within a pine forest made even more beautiful by the setting sun. But I thought my shelter mates from last night were headed here, plus I already was hiking less than I had originally planned, so I kept on hiking. About 20 minutes from the summit, NOBO “Stripes” caught up to me. He also was expecting to find people settled in the cabin but when we arrived, it was empty. It's not great, but this is no Cooper Crackhouse. It was now 7:30 and rumor has it there are bears in the area and the cabin has a door and I'm staying.

They came to the cabin in the morning to eat breakfast out of the wind. The cabin also ended up being a nice haven from an unexpected shower that rolled in the night before, right around 10 p.m. Not that I can't be outside in the tent as in rain, evident by the previous night's decision. As usual, I was the last one out of camp after savoring a delicious cup of instant coffee and doing a little writing. From the cabin, it was a four mile gradual descent to a brook and road crossing. I saw moose prints about a half mile down that clearly were fresh. No other hiker boots overstepped them. I looked around, but no moosies. Mices. Moose. The rest of the hike down was uneventful. The hike up to Mt. Cube was another thing. More awesome views threaded between pine woods. I was taking a break by a small ledge when I met Eric, out for a day hike with his Jack Russell “Pepper” and we hiked the remaining 1.5 miles together to the summit. He pointed out the little speck of the fire tower way in the distance where I had started that morning and you could see the descending ridge line the trail follows. I spent a good hour eating lunch on the exposed granite rock in the warm sun, along with some other SOBOs and day hikers. Even though it wasn't nearly as muggy as it had been the past few days, I stopped at a brook that had a few shallow swimming holes. A really nice four-star brookside stealth site, well hidden from the trail, or so I thought. I didn't want to scare any kids. And by kids I mean 20-somethings in denial about what time and gravity will do to their bodies. I stripped off my 5-day old clothes and took a dip. It was too early to stop for the day, so on went the dirty duds. Turns out the trail did switchback above my hidden swimming puddle, but still mostly out of site. Continued on for 3.5 miles, passing more gorgeous pine needle carpeted stealth sites. Then, I swear, it was all up hill, until I stopped at this sub-star mosquito-infested camping area. I. Do. Not. Understand. These camping locations seem like afterthoughts. I mean, we hike all day, pass awesome views and then are expected to make due with space allocated near some swamp or hidden deep in some thicket? I suppose the assumption is we just need to find a place to sleep each night. The three of us who ended up staying here retired to our tents immediately following dinner. Just. Like. They. Schemed. The saving grace is the stately outhouse—Castellum Excrementi. It is large enough to sleep in, has a small deck and is apparently ADA-compliant, there are hand rails surrounding the “throne.” This, at the top of the non-ADA accessible campsite. This is one of those days that was both beautiful and hard—Mt. Cube was an amazing reward, but hard in the elevation changes, hard to be camping out for the fifth night—the last four of which didn't have nearby water, hard to be passed up by a bunch of speedier NOBOs that make me feel like I'm loosing a race (illogical, I know), and hard to think about taking the time to do things like take a dip in the middle of the afternoon because the opportunity presented itself, because you know you need to make the miles.

Sometime last night a t-storm moved in. Love listening to the rain hit the tent wall. Woke up this morning in the dark light still hearing it, thinking I'm snug and dry (for now) and might read for a bit. I turned on my iPad and discovered it was almost 7 a.m. I guess all that white noise really did help me sleep despite going to bed feeling a whole new level of grossness. Retrieved my sodden food bag protecting protein bar wrappers, discarded oil packets, empty Ziplock freezer bags and few actual food items, then started packing up for the first time on this trip in the rain. But as I like to say: “It was lightening up.” Then the rain stopped altogether by the time I hit the trail. My goal today was the hostel where not only a bed and a shower awaited me, but a food drop. There have been a ton of hikers passing me in both directions lately and this is a popular hostel. I really wanted to get there and didn't pay a whole lot attention to my surroundings except to know the trail is now entering the Whites.The Hiker Yearbook short bus was at the trailhead when I emerged and had cookies and soda trial magic. The mint chocolate cookies were not unlike Girl Scout Thin Mints. Like Thin Mints, I ate half a sleeve or more of them at a go. Then I had my photo taken for the yearbook. Here’s hoping I don't have a chocolate blacked out tooth in the shot. Got my shower, got my food drop, got my laundry done, got everything else dried out from last night's surprise rain. In general, I got caught up.The hostel is extremely welcoming and shall I say, rather bohemian? I wore a vintage tie-die sundress while doing my laundry if that is any indication. Also sleeping on a mattress with clean linens which is a very good thing now that I’ve seen the mattress. My worldly education continues.","Ore Hill Campsitre, NH

MoosilaukeDecided to stay here one more night and slackpack Mt. Moosilauke southbound. The north ascent was reported to be a killer descent—and that would be a correct assessment. Four of us took a shuttle to Kinsman Notch and hiked back to the hostel. The sun was out and the ascent was indeed steep for 1.5 miles following a cascade that occasionally would dampen the trail—meaning rocks—that we were scaling. There were rebar handholds in places—quite a reassuring touch. It was a really pretty climb which eventually got above tree line. I don't have problems hiking over rocks with views like the ones seen today. At least up. Just before reaching the summit, two people told me there was a moose ahead. Of course, the second person added that she had startled it after it startled her—so yeah, no moose sightings just yet. The 4802’ summit was as windy and misty as the photos I've seen posted. Cloud tendrils blew across the open alpine meadows and cairns dotted the landscape indicating the route. Even though it was blustery, I took a break and ate lunch with Solar who had hiked up from the hostel to the summit in the opposite direction northbound. The longer and theoretically less severe descent was another matter. Seemed to take forever to make 3.5 miles, but in actuality it was faster—I was just more tired. Nice to know I had the hostel to head back to at the end of the day. Made it back before the predicted 50% chance of an afternoon thunderstorm hit—and hit hard for a good fifteen minutes. The only problem with this hostel is that it isn't close to anything else. Soft G had just left to pick up sandwiches at the convenience store and her mom, Janel, was able to get a text out to her with an order for a beer and ice cream pick-up on my behalf. And that's what’s for dinner. The only thing missing from this square meal was something from a bakery.","Glencliff, NH

The sky was lighting up over my head while warm water fell—from the shower head.What the two storms did insure last night was for a very wet trail today. In the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, there is a portage called “The Mud Pond Carry.” For almost two miles the path alternates between a shallow two- to three-foot wide stream to sandal sucking muck. It would appear that the Kinsman Ridge Trail the AT follows is a longer version of The Mud Pond Carry. At least today. My shuttle from the hostel didn't get me back to the trail head until after 9 a.m. I left the hostel with dry feet. A sinking bog bridge was met within the first 10 minutes. I think every hiker attempts to keep their feet dry for as long as possible, which is why you often see the-not-so-great practice of alternate routes circumventing wet or muddy areas. I managed to keep my feet mostly dry crossing the submerged planks. But the trail didn't get any better. For most of the day it was basically a sluice for the runoff. When it wasn't straight muck. I finally gave up once my right foot sank calf-deep while attempting to place it on what I assumed to be a solid branch. That actually made it more fun. Instead of worrying about avoidance, I just plowed ahead—at my heady one mile per hour pace of mine.I am still playing it cautiously. The pitch is steep in places, the rocks slippery and my joints not so bendy. So I was more than a little peeved when I finally realized I really was only going one mile per hour. Earlier in the day I was thinking I make a shelter just over 12 miles up the trail—a respectable distance for me. After all, with the exception of Mt. Moosilauke, this first section is White Mountains Lite Version 1.0. I arrived at the Eliza Brooks Shelter at 3:45. Normally, another four miles would be possible this late in the day, but the next three miles climb another 2,000 feet. So, yeah. No. Plus this is one of the few four-star sites I've pitched my tent. I'm hearing and looking at the cascading Eliza Brook as I write, because, you know. I arrived here in camp super early and there is still plenty of light left in the day. Small boulders edge individual paths to each tent site, to the water and to the bearbox—the only place in mind my that boulders are meant to be found. Only the state of the privy knocks a star off of my review—and you really don't want to know why. A high school group is here and drying out from camping in last night’s storms. They were cute—asked me if it was okay to set up their tents nearby because they expected to be noisy teenagers. After today's hike I'll be surprised if they will be able to raise any kind of din over the white noise of the rushing water. But wait—there is a full moon tonight…It also is really cold tonight. Great hiking weather, but I'm now all bundled up in the long johns. Glad my bounce box with the down jacket was successfully delivered to the hostel. And Purples is here. I spent one night with Dysfengshunal and her—way back in New Jersey sharing the bounty bestowed upon us by the beer angels. She had been ahead of me, but foot issues took her off trail for a month. She told me that she is slowing down through the Whites and only did a lousy 10 miles today. We talk some more over dinner and then I wished her well as I joked this will likely be our last night together. Also likely—it wasn't a joke. Musings: Janel and Soft G ended their section hike today, a week earlier than they had planned due to an injury. Like many people I'm meeting on the trail, we friended each other on FaceBook in order to keep in touch about the Katahdin-bound migration; sending trail news and photos and of course learning more about each other's quirky off-trail personalities. It got me thinking about the friend requests I ignore on FaceBook—primarily from old school chums. One of the biggest reasons I tend to ignore them is due to the way FaceBook immediately starts filling your feed with posts from your “new” friends. This is all great when you have “liked” a new group or are keeping in touch with people sharing the same interests at the same time, but I don't necessarily need to see photos of grandchildren of people I hung around with 35 years ago, let alone any political diatribes, when we haven't been in communication pre-FaceBook. Maybe I'm being heartless and missing out on potentially fulfilling reconnections or maybe I'm just saving myself from yet more funny cat videos.","Kinsman Notch, NH

I talked to another solo woman after dinner who had driven two hours and hiked three miles just to camp out this one night during the full moon. It was magical, but cold.I awoke to find that Purples was still in camp. She was considering a short day and slept in or otherwise would have been long gone. We leapfrogged each other all day—mostly she passing me after taking breaks. The trail followed Eliza Brook for almost a mile. Like the brook the trail edged south from Kinsman Notch the day I slacked, it was another gorgeous hike, but without the deathly pitches and slippery rocks. Like yesterday, I also heard a series of loud jet noises overhead. Unlike yesterday, there was no threatening weather and I didn't mistake it for thunder. Not sure what was going on, but it seemed concentrated around an hour or so in the morning—like one runway allowing planes to take off or a military operation. Regardless, obviously I'm not within a protected wilderness area which theoretically extends to the air space above as well as to the woods and waters below.After leaving enchanting Eliza, Eliza turned into Sybil—you remember Sybil—and became a mean girl, and transforming herself into an unrecognizable trail. It went straight up following more spewed boulder fields. Unlike the rocks and puked up rocks I've scrambled over previously, these led us up to actual mountain peaks with literally breath-taking views. I found myself saying “wow’, out loud a lot today whenever I turned around and looked. Still, it took 2.5 hours to hike 2.5 miles to the first 4,358-foot summit, South Kinsman. I was taking my first lunch break when Chompa came over the top talking on his phone to his mom. We finally had four bars of coverage and apparently she had called just as he summited. I would have been super impressed if he had been able to talk while climbing those last hundred yards. You sort of needed to use both hands. And there was the occasional need to do a little booty-scootching.The hike after that went faster. The ridge between South and North Kinsman was easy to walk despite the 300-foot elevation changes. I did stop for an hour at the first of many trail side Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) “huts,” an off-the-grid accommodation for people who hike in and don't plan on carrying a tent or food. The stay includes dinner and breakfast, but is pricey by hiker standards. Some people refer to the huts as the Appalachian Money Club. But you can get cheap, even free, food there passing through. The leftover tour has begun. Purples had, of course, beaten me there and we were soon joined by Manatee. The cook gave us free oatmeal and I bought a bowl of thin black bean soup. Who knew that oatmeal tastes great in black bean soup? I also downed two cups of coffee now planning on bypassing the town of Lincoln and pushing on to the next campsite, also managed by the AMC.The trail passed under interstate 93, a highway I know we traveled with the kids years ago when we stopped to see the, now fallen, profile of the Old Man in the Mountains, from the visitor center in Franconia Notch. I seem to recall no one wanted to hike the short nature trail that day and we merely got out of the car to take in the view from the notch. Ironic now.Well, thank goodness for caffeine. And oatmeal black bean soup. And a west facing mountain. The next campsite was 2.6 miles—all uphill. I had plowed through my remaining energy bars I keep handy and arrived in camp around 7:30 p.m. I considered stealth camping, but having amenities like a privy and bearbox continue to be priorities when I can get them, so payed my $10 and set up my tent on a platform right next to a French-speaking couple. As far as I can tell, no other AT thru-hiker decided to do the same. Everyone here are just doing short loop hikes and apparently didn't want to stealth camp. I talked to a few of them while getting my dinner going in the segregated cooking area. Most of them seemed to have packed too much food and one man gave me a bunch of Justin’s nut butter packets and a Clif Bar, probably close to $10 worth of food—so as trades go, that worked out pretty well for me. The tent took some engineering to get my non-freestanding tent to stay put on a wooden deck, but finally got enough rocks in place to hold everything tight. Devoured dinner in the dark and fell asleep listening to the wind blow just a quarter mile below the Franconia ridge.","Eliza Brook Shelter, NH

First there was Franconia Ridge—a two mile stretch of trail, traversing multiple summits, above tree line. I climbed four peaks over 4,000 feet each, two of which were over 5,000. With the clear skies, the views were outstanding. Also noted: Military aircraft is responsible for the sounds heard in the airspace the past few days. Two M15s (?) flew over while atop Mt. Lincoln.Second: Trail magic happened at the 5,089-foot Mt. Lincoln summit. If I hadn't hiked up to Liberty Springs last night and if I hadn’t taken a break to call Sam when I had four bars this morning, I would surely have missed the drinks and food being served up for lunch today. Here's how it went down: Two men with external frame backpacks passed me while I was on the phone at the first summit. After I rang off, I headed toward Mt. Lincoln where the two men (Trail Mix and Brendon) were now, theoretically, resting against the rocks, out of the wind. They inquired about my trip and around the same time, four SOBO guys strolled by. At this point, Trail Mix asks; “Anyone interested in a margarita?” Say what? And he proceeds to unpack ice, a battery operated blender, limes and a batch of homemade margarita mix. It was crazy. Here we are at over 5,000 feet and this guy is performing trail magic. But it gets better. He pulls out a sign, actually a cue-card, indicating the lunch he’s prepared for we, the extremely fortunate and apparently chosen thru-hikers, and tells us that Brendon and he work together on Saturday Night Live. Trail Mix has hiked 70% of the trail and picked this date two months ago with this plan, because, you know. Epic trail magic doesn't happen at these elevations. After the margaritas are consumed, he slices big, red tomatoes and fresh mozzarella for an appetizer. Then he lights up his Coleman Peak One stove and reheats the pepper and sausage hero sandwich fixings. After that is gone, he cuts up a peach cake, sprays chilled whipped cream and sprinkles each serving with fresh peaches. To say the whole experience was amazing is an understatement. We all stayed put on that summit for over an hour. If there was a contest for the best trail magic, Trail Mix wins hands down over any free hiker pancake breakfast, Gatorade cooling in a stream or even beer. Already the trail rumors have turned this lunch into a legend. So tonight finds me stealth camping, alone, by the side of the trail. Didn't make it as far as I had initially planned pre-epic trail magic. The trail is still rocky and steep in places—including a descent over what counts as a small waterfall in my book. I questioned a few hikers whether or not they thought the rocks were as bad as Pennsylvania, or were we just getting used to them? We all agree that they seem smoother with better footholds and are far less painful here in New Hampshire. And of course, these rocks are taking us to actual epic vistas. My entire quota allowed for the use of the adjective “epic” is now exhausted.","Liberty Spring AMC Tentsite, NH

And due to cell coverage, particularly the lack thereof, made it even more stressful. Ray and Hilda, who live near Gorham, NH, are friends of a friend of mine. Many months ago, they offered to house me when I got close and we had been coordinating a date. They even extended the offer to come as far as Crawford Notch, an hour away from their home. With projected storms and working around their vacation plans, we had arranged to meet tonight. At Crawford Notch. I had a description of their car and an idea of what they looked like. I'm not sure if they had yet seen a photo of me. Up until today, I always had cell coverage and intended to follow up with additional details–such as my pace. All they knew is that I had 15 miles to knock off with what I estimated to be an arrival time of early evening. But 15 miles is a big day for me—especially in the Whites. I had another over 4,000-foot summit to first cover early in the day. The plan, in my mind, was to send them an update once I reached the Zealand Hut. But I had no phone reception for the entire day. In order to make more than 15 miles, I was on the trail by 6:00 a.m. I reached the Galehead Hut, my original destination the day before I was delayed by awesome trail magic, at 7:30, just as the guests were finishing breakfast. I filled up my water bottle, bought a cup of coffee and clandestinely finished off a serving bowl of cold scrambled eggs that were still left on the table. Then I summited 4,902-foot South Twin Mountain well before the predicted t-storms. All good thus far.Next was the interesting Guyot Mountain area with Krummholz, stunted subalpine vegetation. It was blustery by the trail sign wedged into the rock slide. Rocky, yes, but still all good.At some point, I made a mental shift to not-all-good. Might have been due to my inability to get a text update out to Ray and Hildy. Or because my knees were beginning to talk to me on the now mostly downhill trail. Or because I hadn't taken a real break since my leftover breakfast at the hut. I reached the Zealand Hut at 2 p.m. where I finally did take a break, buying a cheap bowl of soup and talking to a few other NOBOs—which turned out to be fortuitous. Again I had no success texting Ray and Hildy. Now the real dilemma: Would they make the hourlong drive based on a loose plan? Should I take a shortcut trail to the AMC Highland Center where the Hut Croo said I would have cell coverage? I decided to stick to the plan and head to the pre-arranged meeting place. I was tired, hot and not at all sure what to do if I continued to have no cell coverage. One thing I did know is that there was no way I wanted to camp out that night. I continued to check my phone over the next four hours only to see “No Service” the entire time.Lucky for me, Ray and Hildy are hikers who are familiar with the Whites and the time it takes hiking the trails. Also lucky for me, I had spoke with a few hikers who knew me and had heard me lament that I couldn't get ahold of these new friends. Ray and Hildy had arrived in the parking lot at 4:30, the earliest they figured I could make it based upon the assumption I had been at Galehead Hut. When other hikers emerged from the trailhead where they were parked, they were able to learn when I had been at the Zealand Hut and that I was on the way down. Meanwhile, I was increasingly frustrated with my inability to have thought of a contingency plan or just plain better planning on my part. Plus, I was stumbling more than once and one NOBO even passed me freaking running down the trail. (We hates them.) And I wasn't sure what I'd find once I reached the notch.What I did find was still no cell coverage. As I was cursing at my phone, I also saw the silver Subaru with two slightly familiar looking faces. It was 6:30 p.m. To say I was relieved beyond belief would be accurate. Also contrite. They had patiently waited two hours.I am now fed and listening to the storms finally pass while clean and in a bed on a beautiful farm.

But that guy never moved or stopped snoring all night. At 1:48 a.m. I started listening to music and even that didn't drown him out. I must have fallen asleep at some point because I had two stressful dreams.The first involved a semi that wouldn't allow our car to merge onto a highway in rain. The second had my parents, along with an aunt and uncle, meeting me here at the hut, but arriving too late for dinner. They then forgot to take a huge bag of food and gear of mine back home with them. Maybe that was a nightmare.Actually, the real nightmare occurred later. Today started off just fine, but then it turned into Pennsylvania. I headed out at 9:40 a.m. after folding 36 bunk blankets and sweeping bunk room floors as part of my work-for-stay. It was only 1.4 miles (up) to the 6,288-foot summit of Mt. Washington. I took pictures, wrote postcards and hung around for a little while before heading on around 11:30.The next 5.6 miles took me more than 7 hours to hike. This turned into one of the hardest days since Pennsylvania. It was all a sea of boulders—or felzenmeer, which is my new favorite word I learned from Hildy. I just cannot easily descend on this stuff. My knees refuse to bend and the uneven rocks aggravate my feet. Plus, I was internalizing a comment made yesterday by a passing fatalistic SOBO who I had cautioned about an upcoming cliff. His response was that this is nothing, nothing! New Hampshire is a cake walk compared to Maine! Cake walk my ass. My original goal was a free tent site, 10 miles down the trail. Instead I showed up at the Madison Hut looking for floor space again tonight. It wasn't a sure thing, since the predicted storms never materialized and they already had a work-for-stay hiker. Another couple was hoping for the same following their 18-MILE day. We were both hurting for different reasons. So, with the exception of summiting Mt.

After helping out with tidying up the bunkhouse, a skill I’ve now mastered, today’s torturous affair with the trail began. The trail climbed 566 feet in half a mile, all felzenmeer crappola. It was done in heavy fog while the wind huffed and puffed. Although I now experienced conditions commonly found in the Whites, I did not consider this fun—or even remotely fulfilling. It ultimately took four hours to maneuver only two miles from Madison Hut down to tree line. Even when the sun emerged and I was rewarded with majestic views over which flew remnant threads of clouds, I didn't care all that much. I must be one of the few people in the world that hasn't liked hiking the Presidentials here in the Whites. One of the high points came when I met fellow TrailJournals blogger, Sponge Bob (still within the first three miles and five hours of lumbering.) We had a nice chat—or at least I had a captive audience that allowed me to vent my one-sided opinion of the theoretical trail. From Osggod to Pinkham Notch, the trail was what I would consider an actual trail, but by now knees and feet were beyond displeased. I got a bunk in the Joe Dodge Lodge in Pinkham Notch sharing the dorm-like room with three other women, two of whom are doing a very reasonable hike up to Lake of the Clouds Hut and the other who is sectional hiking the AT with her dad. While I think sectional hikers have a much rougher time—they don't develop “trail legs” over time—it's the Hut hikers who likely have the most enjoyable, albeit more expensive, experiences.

Hikers: 19 Tramily peeps here at the hostel
I contemplated a number of scenarios during and after yesterday’s so-called hike, one of which was to skip pretty far up the trail into Maine. What I decided to do was a sort of baby step—move my reservation with the White Mountains Lodge and Hostel in Gorham, New Hampshire from Thursday up one day, omitting a two-day (for me), 21-day rock climbing section of Wildcat Mountain and its numerous peaks—and taking yet another zero. The hostel had a food drop I had mailed myself, so a stop was in the plan regardless. 
My Dodge Lodge sectional hiking roommate, who also had reservations at the same hostel, provided the transportation and the deal was done. Instead of white blazes, I followed the yellow blazed highway lines in a car. And at least at this point, I have no regrets. 
My decision was reaffirmed when I met up with a hiker here at the hostel I hadn't seen since Hanover. She hikes at my same pace, but was two days ahead. We are planning on hiking together for at least the next few days, including what is billed as the most difficult—or fun—mile of the AT, depending upon your point of view. Like yesterday wasn't bad enough. But I will choose to view it as fun. I also reread a few of the TrailJournals.com posts of the women I had following last year to see what their accounts had been—after I made the decision to yellow blaze—and I was relieved to find their experiences matched my own. Turns out I was completely justified in having a melt down atop the lonely rocky peak of Mt. Madison.
Like the Bearded Woods Hostel in Connecticut, this hostel provides clothes you can wear while all your clothes are being washed. Unlike my stay at the Bearded Woods, I went commando grocery shopping. Now that was a new hiker experience for me.","Dodge Lodge, Pickham Notch, NH

She stayed at the hostel last night and wanted to hike to Mt. Hayes and back. We took a bunch of stops and by the time she was ready to head back to Gorham, she was planning her own thru-hike.Word had it that a moose and calf frequented Gentian Pond and we were not disappointed. Around dinner, one of the section hikers reported a sighting and we all rushed down to the pond to see mama swim across followed by baby. I also took a dip in the pond, when it was moose-less, and it felt great. If every day ended with a swim, this hiking thing wouldn't be half bad. And today, I passed my 1000 hiking mile mark.

But I slept really well, having properly checked for ticks.Hiked all day with Purples and Spirit and we crossed into Maine, their fourteenth and last state; my eleventh. Call me crazy, but Maine already feels different—the mountain summits are more rounded and there has already been more boardwalks and log ladders. Also more cliffs to climb up and down. We did a lot of that today. Purples can hike fast--so it might have been killing her to hang out with me, but she needs to slow down because her dad is meeting up with her at the end and she can't arrive too early. We thought it was going to be a short 9.6 mile day, but there were a lot of PUDs (Pointless Ups and Downs) and the cliffs and ledges slowed me down. Unlike New Hampshire, the technical parts—at least for today—weren't long in duration, whereas you had to walk for miles on boulder fields through the whites. The three Goose Mountain peaks we summited today, were balds all above tree line, but with interesting dips into the forest. After stopping at the Goose Shelter, populated with one group of surly men and another of chattering girls on a backpacking camp trip, we decided to stealth camp another mile and a half further, but not after first helping to eat unwanted leftovers from the girls’s dinner. Purple had cruised ahead and found us a site with room for the three of us at the entrance to tomorrow's Mahoosuc Notch Day o’Fun, but unfortunately, due to her speed, that meant she missed out on the leftovers. Just meant more for us.","Gentian Pond Shelter

Hitting the Mahoosuc Notch first thing in the morning was a great idea, even though it still took us just under two hours climbing over and squeezing under Volkswagen Beetle to semi-trailer sized boulders. We found ice in deep shadowed pockets that we had heard about, but not the skeleton of a trapped moose, apparently now long-gone. Spirit, Purples and I were joined by Squirrel, a sectional hiker out for a few weeks who is planning on going to Katahdin as well. The Mahoosuc Arm was up next, a climb of over 1,600-feet in 1.5 miles. Reports indicated vertical walls, but I really didn't find it to be more difficult than anything else to date—oh like, let’s say MT. MADISON. Actually, the embedded rebar stairway going up Goose Eye Mountain East Peak yesterday was more technical. And later, the exposed cliff face of Old Speck was more scary. Still, it zapped my energy. We swam in Speck Pond in early afternoon. The trail passes right along this mountain lake and a bunch of us jumped in. It was a perfect summer afternoon and I, for one, was really glad to take the time and play in the water. But that set us back as we didn't leave until 2:40 p.m. While the swim gave me energy to hike up 4,033-foot Old Speck, I quickly lost steam and my knees began to rebel during the 4.6 mile descent to Grafton Notch. The goal was to hike an additional 2.3 miles up to the next shelter, but somewhere during the last two miles I was already planning on stealth camping before that. Besides, I already knew that there was going to be a big crowd at that site between thru-hikers and weekenders and maybe even more youth camps. Trail magic in the form of soda and water was waiting in the Grafton Notch parking lot. So was Spirit and Purples who hiked faster. And so was Wishbone, who was awaiting a ride from the Pine Ellis Hostel in Andover, another eight miles up trail. I had noted “slacking?” on my map, but hadn't made any inquiries earlier. Now myself, along with Rubix and Fisherman were suddenly all very interested in seeing if there was more room available when Wishbone’s shuttle arrived. Blissfully—yes. I was too tired and not all that hungry to walk the short distance to town for the all-you-can-eat pizza buffet and instead heated up water for some ramen noodles, took my Ibuprofen and I'm now back in a bed tonight sharing a room with strangers—a concept to which I've become strangely accustomed. Tomorrow I'll be back on the trail slacking back to this same bed again. While I love camping, I also loved the idea of not hiking another step today.","Mahoosuc Notch Trail

So another easier day on my feet. But. For a reason I don't fully understand, the hostel wanted me to change rooms. Okay, I bundled up my stuff and was given the pick of the five beds in the adjacent room. Jumping ahead, when I returned at the end of the day, I was told I had been moved to the bunkhouse. This didn't sit well with me. In addition, our shuttle had been 45 minutes late the day before and while the hostel ran a somewhat turn-key operation, there were a number of miscues that had been adding up. When I moved my stuff from the house to what appeared to be a shed-like addition, a space not far removed from an enclosed trail shelter, but with a price, I made a call to the other town hiker hostel, The Cabin. They had room. Paid for my shuttle, left and arrived in time for the communal family dinner with the 14 other hikers staying here tonight. This place is more like the Bearded Woods Hostel where I had stayed back in Connecticut. The bunk room is a bit nicer—and less expensive than Pine Ellis, but the deal maker is the $15 meal price that covers both dinner AND a full breakfast. Awesomeness. Except that I still am not eating the food I've been carrying. Their hiker clothes box includes whacky things like smoking jackets and velour dressing gowns you can wear while doing laundry, so that's fun. My clothes are still clean from yesterday’s laundry, so I needn't dress up—or down—tonight for dinner. After yesterday's late pick-up, and let me be clear—I’m not being “that guy” and acting all put-out. The shuttle driver from Pine Ellis admitted forgetting about Wishing Bone and I, eight miles from town, along a road where there is no cell coverage, I thought I’d attempt a hitch back to town. As it turned out, Wishing Bone and I had turned down THREE offers of rides while awaiting our late shuttle, so I expected it to be just as easy to catch a ride today. One half hour later, nada. Not one car had passed. Fortunately the first hostel had a driver out to pick up a few other hikers. Paying their per hiker shuttle fee, I jumped in—only to later discover my unanticipated relocation to the bunkhouse upon my return. Today was a really easy hike. More like a pleasant walk in the woods. Oh, there was one mountain peak to summit, but it was a civilized ascent. Stone stairs. Rebar handholds. Log ladders. Nothing too scary. We likes Maine very much. Sphagnum moss carpeted the forest floors. Open understory pines. A lake with a rock star stealth campsite. Moose poop line paths. What’s not to love? And for the last two miles, a gentle rain shower. My umbrella was enough to keep me dry and happy. Just wished I could have said that about my original lodging arrangements--the happy part, that is. Both hostels are dry--well at least I think that shell of a bunkhouse was weatherproof--but now we'll never know, unless I hear about it through the trail gossip.","East B Hill Road, Andover, ME

Breakfast at the Cabin was epic. Waffles, blueberry pancakes, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, melon, bananas and beans. This—and dinner—all for $15. Eighty-three old “Honey,” the owner and a hiker herself, brought me to the trailhead post gorge. Met up with some of the people who had stayed at the Pine Ellis Hostel who told me that the bed I was kicked out of remained unoccupied that night—so that was weird. Their loss, my gain. And by gain I mean weight—after all that food. Could be because I had downloaded a bunch of Wait! Wait! Don't Tell Me Podcasts. Or because I had slacked for the past two days. Or because it was perfect weather. Or because I AM IN MAINE! But I loved today’s hike. The morning started with a 2,200 elevation gain climbing up 3600-foot high Old Blue Mountain that took a few hours. Took a break at the top along with two NOBOs and two SOBOs. The SOBOs still think Maine is tough, but it is so much better than New Hampshire, IMO. I still fume over that haughty “New Hampshire is a cakewalk” comment imparted to me by a passing SOBO near Webster Cliffs. Talked to another hostel hiker who had taught at UW-Milwaukee the years I attended art school there which also passed the time. He also affirmed that Maine is easier than the Whites. I don't get the feeling that the trail maintainers, the Maine AT Club, is testing our fear of heights, sense of balance or has resolved to kill us. The view after summiting Bemis Mountain is the real reason I loved today. I realized I was peering down on Upper Richardson and Rangeley Lakes, lakes I paddled in their entirety as part of my Northern Forest Canoe Trail trip in 2011. I've entered familiar territory—from a completely different perspective, but still. I’ve been here before and it was good.Spirit emerged from the Bemis Shelter where she had taken a break just as I was passing it and we hiked together to tonight’s campsite. The trail followed rain-washed boulders sculpted by wind and time and lined by blueberries. We spent a good half hour picking in the afternoon sun high above the lakes.

The inn/hostel has an industrial urban motif with interesting touches such as headboards created from doors, barn wood wainscot walls and mason jar light fixtures. My next door neighbor back home would absolutely love what they've done to the place.

Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544678,"So this is serendipitous. Without remotely attempting to try, I was here in Rangeley exactly five years ago to the day. Thanks to Facebook “Memories,” I know this to be true. A five-year-old post appeared showing my paddling friend Joyce and I as we arrived by canoe on that 2011 Northern Forest Canoe Trail trip. Two days ago I realized I could scout out the river I had written about in my guidebook—based upon the input of others, but hadn't been able to paddle myself—as well as check out a new pond that had been added to the NFCT in 2013 while in the area. Who knows when I can be back here again, so what the heck—another zero. Maybe I can finally convince my accountant to start writing off this research time I'm completing.Spirit joined in as the hostel owner’s teenage son took us out in his reconstructed, doorless yellow Jeep to scout out the S. Branch Dead River, a 20-mile section of the NFCT flowing between Rangeley and Stratton. We found the put-in easily enough, but despite the tracks that seemed to lead from the river around a dangerous water fall, we never did find the correct take-out. We did, however, find dirt roads that led us toma secluded bench overlooking a large blueberry patch and a shooting range. The shooting range was a separate find from the bench and blueberries, although a secluded bench might have been a nice touch overlooking the targets and piles of discarded shotgun shells too. In the afternoon, Spirit and I borrowed a canoe from a local outfitter and we paddled across Haley Pond so I could check out that portage and the even newer lean-to shelter near the Maine Forestry Museum. (See I really was working.) Spent the rest of the afternoon writing and organizing my food resupply for the next few days, then headed off to dinner. Being in Maine and what not, I just can't get enough of lobster rolls when they are offered, paired of course, with a local adult beverage. The trail was quite good today.","Rangeley, ME

Still loving Maine, although a steep rocky descent and ascent section between The Horn and Saddleback Junior made me think I was momentarily back in New Hampshire. Spirit and I spent the day hiking together over three peaks to tonight’s camp, where we again met up with Squirrel. While taking a break atop 4,120-foot high Saddleback, two people came up to the sign to touch it. Turns out the father (70) and daughter (36) were celebrating their shared birthdays with an annual hike up Saddleback. We picked some blueberries, took more breaks and still arrived in camp by 4 p.m. where we had to fend off the young boys camp group taking over the shelter and best campsites. The reported “gushing” stream was only a trickle, more hikers are arriving and an older hiker kindled a camp fire, so it could be a lively night. It certainly is shaping up to be a crowded one.Musings: Th Poplar Ridge Shelter, where we are camping tonight, is the last shelter where the late “Inchworm” was reported to have been seen before she disappeared in 2014. The woods here don't seem any more dense or the trail any less logical. We heard a rumor that she may have stopped taking medication for a psychological condition and that she had been mistakenly hiding from the search parties. If this is true, it would make a lot more sense than merely getting lost or being an inadvertent part of a covert NCIS operation. Does feel a bit odd to be staying in the same location where this tragedy occurred, but then again I stayed at the shelter location of two 1986 murders just outside of Duncannon, Pennsylvania too.","Rangeley, Maine

Hikers had carried it the remaining distance raising awareness of LNT (Leave No Trail) principles and it was now on its way to finishing an AT thru-hike while strapped to the packs of individual hikers passing it along.

Today’s EKG elevation changes began at 1201’ to 3,831’ South Horn, down to 3,350,’ back up to 4145’ high Bigelow Mountain, followed by 4,090’ Avery Peak, back down to the boulder fields of 2,224’ Safford Notch and finally back up to 3,010 Little Bigelow Mountain.All of this range overlooks Flagstaff Lake, one of the lakes I paddled five years ago. The history of the lake is interesting—and potentially sad. The Dead River was dammed to created Flagstaff Lake more than eighty years ago and a town was relocated. On calm days, paddlers can peer into the watery depths near Jim Eaton Hill looking for submerged foundations and chimneys, evidence of a once vibrant community. The wind was howling when we summited Bigelow—and the trail went right over the highest possible exposed rock point. That was a little dicey, but we stayed low. I also took a bunch of photos of the wildly flying clouds and sheets of rain we could see falling across bits of the landscape. Okay. So there was one outrageous thing we ended up doing—we cowboy camped on some exposed rocks atop Little Bigelow Mountain tonight. In other words, we slept under the stars without setting up the tent. Spirit and I had been talking about doing this and there was zero percent chance of rain. The wind never really subsided, but we nestled ourselves among the boulders, watched the sun set behind Avery Mountain, waited for the waning moon to set and because it is August, looked to the Persiedes constellation for meteors. It took a long time for the sky to get dark. But meteors we did see—and also the Milky Way. Every time I woke up I’d poke my head out of my down sleeping bag and look at the sky I rarely see this illuminated. Or even at all during this trip as I’m typically asleep by 9 p.m. I also rarely—or never—wear all my clothes to bed at night, and by all I mean one wool t-shirt, two long sleeve shirts, a down jacket, wool long johns and wool socks.

And the wind blew all night. My little nest held a small pine tree keeping me from rolling away from the boulder and blueberry bushes haloed my head. Spirit laid out her Therm-o-rest and sleeping bag atop the largest boulder. We awoke as the sun was rising—4:50 a.m., although the sun wasn't reaching our boulder beds and it was still cold. Decided to start hiking to a more protected area to eat our first breakfast. I’ve been dropping reports of wildlife sightings because there have been none beyond the usual woodland squirrel/chipmunk/chickadee varieties. I am still keeping my eye out for moose, especially since we have seen so much moose poop on the trail. And we saw a lot within the next half mile between our cowboy camp and breakfast nook. Last night we had convinced ourselves that the moose don't come this high and Spirit, in particular, would be just fine sleeping along, what was essentially, the middle of the trail. Well that might not have been the case at all, but no mm large mammal disturbed our repose.Despite our early rising, we took our time making breakfast and didn't really start hiking in earnest until well after 8 a.m. The trail descended over exposed granite slabs and amidst more blueberry patches, then into the woods and to the shores of Flagstaff Lake. We met a group of day campers who had left trail magic: fresh peaches and homemade energy balls (chocolate, oatmeal, sugar bombs—yum!) Yeah! Second breakfast that isn't bar-based! Except for West Carry Pond, the rest of the day consisted of more utilitarian hiking—lots of woods with few views. For a time, it did feel like work—even though the elevation remained flat. But sometimes I am just making miles to get to the next camp site. Streams have been really low or dry the last few days, but we are seeing lakes and ponds all the time now. I think the dryness is responsible for the almost utter lack of mosquitos. I haven't used repellent in weeks.Our campsite tonight is another stealth spot—this one right on a small beach along East Carry Pond. Another good one.

We had plenty of time and took our second breakfast break at the pond’s edge. This area is so similar to the boulder edged shorelines in the Boundary Waters.Then Sybil made an appearance. We had another 3.7 miles to go. From Pierce Pond, the trail followed Pierce Brook and it's lovely cascades and waterfalls. What was not lovely was all the roots and rocks and hills that Sybil threw at us. Beware of flat looking lines. Even though the guidebook showed no significant elevation changes and looked to be easy, it was another foot-bruising obstacle course. Up until now, Spirit and I had been chatting away all morning, but I was slowing down and I needed to take my mind off the trail by listening to a “Wait! Wait! Don't Tell Me.” podcast. I find that it helps pass the distances in measured time. And comedy.The last mile of the trail finally settled down to a flatter path and we had crossed the river just after noon. Phone service is sketchy, so we tried hitching a ride to the inn and hostel we had booked. Alex, who turned out to be a 2015 Northern Forest Canoe Trail summer intern, pulled over in his kayak-bedecked, NFCT-bumper stickered Subaru to give us a ride. Mustard Seed, a hiker Spirit has leap-frogged with since she started, is here tonight at the Sterling Inn, too. Another afternoon spent doing laundry, repacking food and heading out to a brew pub for dinner tonight, but it's back to work again tomorrow.","East Pond Carry, ME

And here's an interesting nutritional note. Apparently one 6 oz. unit actually consists of two portions—you know, like how a 12 oz. can of soda is intended to be shared. Each “serving” was 390 calories. So, yeah, I just downed 780 calories—and that was BEFORE my Edamame Green Noodle Bowl was ready.Got a bit of a late start this morning after waking up before 6. While the bed was cozy, passing semis and unseasonably warm temps made for a restless sleep. Our goal today was tentatively Moxie Bald Mountain, but it was a hot day. After knocking off six miles to the shelter in 2.5 miles, stopped at the Pleasant Pond Beach to dip our feet. Met Savage, a young woman, we had crossed paths with earlier this week.Then headed up Pleasant Mountain. Pretty much during the hottest time of the day. Theoretically the trail should have been easier, but man, it was hot. Spirit and I hike together during most of the day, sharing secrets and talking football, but after lunch I started lagging behind. Only the promise of a swim in Moxie Pond kept me motivated. Met up with Spirit by one of the near waterless streams just under a mile from the lake around 4. Only the lakes and ponds can be relied upon for water right now. All of the rivers we've crossed that were supposed to be forded have exposed rocks we can hop across.Swimming washes away all the fatigue, but it still didn't look like we'd shoot for Moxie Bald, another 5 miles away any longer. But refreshed, we could go another 2.8 miles to the next shelter. Both the tent sites and shelter were empty when we arrived around 6:30 p.m The SOBO and NOBO crowds are really thinning. We appear to be in between groups. Decided to make dinner and it was at this point where the inhaling of the Whoopie Pie came to pass. I am now writing atop Moxie Bald Mountain. A second night of cowboy camping was too good to pass—especially since tonight is supposed to be the peak meteor shower night. And it was only another two miles with nothing left to do but set up sleeping bags. The last half mile was a little steep to pick our way through the falling darkness. Passed under the cave feature which we might have appreciated better in daylight. A small owl flew between us in the twilight. Arrive atop Moxie Bald and discovered Savage already ensconced near the summit sign. Shared the best half can of warm IPA ever and searched for meteors. Disappointing show so far, but the night is still young.","Sterling Inn, Carruatunk, ME

At least when I was looking. The sky remained illuminated by the half moon for quite a while, but I would check the stars out each time I awoke during the night. Really glad we made it all the way—this was one of the best nights camping so far. A mosquito woke me up just before a few light rain drops fell around 5:30 a.m. Got the sleeping bag tucked away and then no additional rain fell, so we started on first breakfast. Left our cowboy camp before 7, but within five minutes we stopped for second breakfast—blueberries begging to be picked. Two miles down the mountain returned us to a different end of Moxie Pond and a shelter where we stopped for third breakfast and a quick dip in the leech-infested waters. Still totally worth the risk. Still feels humid, but we don't have the sun beating down on us like yesterday.Within half a mile of leaving the shelter, the rain finally started falling for real. An all-day kind of rain. Decided to head to the next shelter at the eleven mile mark for a late lunch/early dinner before moving on a few more miles to a campsite that sets us up for a short day into Monson tomorrow. The trail was almost entirely flat, just like the guidebook line suggests, so it was fairly easy to walk fast even when the rain turned it into a fast moving stream in places. Walking in the rain (under my umbrella) made the day more interesting. At times it got heavy, then lightened up, then stopped altogether. I don't normally get to experience the life span of a rain shower like this in my normal life. And despite some people's opinion, I didn't melt. We arrived at the shelter where three young, um, self-deceived* SOBOs, have been taking a zero. Dude! It's raining! This after having just taken a bunch of zeros in Monson. Yesterday. This is only mile 123.5 for them. One guy told us he started on July 4—almost six weeks ago. Another wanted to hike at least a little today and were going to check a campsite another .3 miles down the trail. That would make it one of the shortest neros ever. I'm not a betting person, but me thinks the likelihood of any of these spitting, cigarette-rolling, GameBoy-packing bros making it to Georgia, is slim to none. Another sign that the trail has been a kinder and gentler version of its rough cousin? My knees are not stiff tonight and my feet aren't hurting. *Spell check changed my original adjective and I like this better.","Moxie Bald Mountain

This is the last town before the weeklong hike ending at Baxter State Park and Katahdin. Lots of thoughts happening—Spirit will be finishing along with a bunch of other Georgia to Maine NOBOs. I registered for my permit to hike Katahdin nine days from today. They are lots of names I recognize who have finished in the past two weeks and those of us planning to summit on the same day are feeling bonded by this experience even if we've been leap-frogging around each other for weeks or months. Stripe is one such fellow. He met up with me back in Vermont on a particularly hard ascent up to Smart Mountain, where we camped together at the Fire Warden Cabin. We had talked for about two hours. I hadn't seen him since. Spirit, on the other hand, had hiked through the Whites with him and another hiker. Not only did her shared experience differ significantly from mine, she was better friends with him because of the number of days they spent as a little group. Yet we both had overlapping time with Stripe and now we are all set to summit the same day. Spirit also has another unique situation unfolding. She and five other hikers—all initially strangers to each other—all started on February 16. All are still on the trail within days of each other. It's entirely possible that four of the six will summit together—the other two are known to be a few days ahead with a deadline they need to keep. Sam and I finally figured out how he can meet up with me in a place where cell coverage is limited.There is a little giddiness, a little reminiscing and a little sadness beginning to seep into the comings and goings.

But boy did I let out a whoop when I turned on my phone at the Route 17 parking lot. The text read “Tis time for me to ask...will you be my maid of honor at 9:00 a.m. in Monson tomorrow? We have been waiting for you.""They were married this morning at Shaw’s Hostel in Monson, in the presence of other hikers. Justine’s father, who is a minister in this town, officiated. The bride wore a beige rayon tea-length dress and the maid of honor wore her clean hiker clothes. And then afterwards, they accompanied me on my hike entering the 100 Mile Wilderness—and I accompanied them on their honeymoon. We took our time, talking and catching up and not paying much attention to the trail except that it remains beautiful in my eyes. After yesterday's rains, verdant spaghnum mosses and lichens are thick and spongy. We passed several ponds and TK related bits about the area’s logging and railroad histories.

But after a leisurely breakfast, Justine, TK and Moxie headed back to their car and I continued north. For the first time in weeks, I was alone again and thinking how I should have spent more time planning the next few days with Spirit. But my lack of foresight didn't last too long.Rumored trail magic appeared at a road crossing around noon. A sign directed hikers down a muddy road to a camp (or as we call them in Wisconsin, cabins) where “Scout” had cold beer and soda and a grilled warmed up ready to serve up burgers, hotdogs and corn on the cob. These were not options. We got all of that. Scout’s trail magic was in honor of his son, “Yogi Bear,” who had hiked the AT in the 90s, but died of a heart attack (post-hike) at the pre-mature age of only 47. Yogi Bear’s birthday is August 9th and Scout has been cooking up trail magic in the years since during the week of his birthday. His ashes were spread on the Barren Mountain Ledges that framed the camp’s vista. While I was visiting—and feasting—Jupiter arrived. Jupiter is a fellow Appalachian Trials blogger from Florida. And because of the times in which we live, we've been Facebook friends, but had never met in person. This is due to the fact that a) he lives in Florida and b) he started his hike—900 miles ago up in Quebec—hiking the International Trail and is hiking south. And c) he is hiking ultralight—a mere seven pound base weight that helps him hike thirty mile days. I'd been following his progress and expected to see him speeding by me somewhere in the 100 mile wilderness. Instead he shows up a quarter mile off trail at the Trail Magic. And—I didn't recognize him at all until he introduced himself. Facebook didn't do very well showing his 6’2” height. Spirit also showed up during my second beer. She had put in the seven miles I had hiked the day prior. That same morning. And so we continued on together—heading toward the Cloud Pond Shelter. The trail passed by streams and waterfalls and we climbed Barren Mountain late in the afternoon arriving at the very crowded shelter area even later. I still managed to get in a weedy swim before the sun set. The only available tenting space (that I trusted) was along a side trail leading to the pond. This was a very overused designated shelter/camping area and the trail news reported that there were several left “traces” of former visitors, meaning unburied poop. In fact, one guy did step in a pile. Besides the bane of a different sort of trail magic, the whole place felt claustrophobic. In general, kinda, sorta, not worth the extra .4 mile walk—except for the swimming part. We've been meeting a steady flow of SOBOs, and it suddenly occurred to me they aren't just starting out. It's getting to be too late. So my question now has changed from “when did you start?” to “where did you flip from?” Some began their NOBO hikes too late from Georgia in the first place, some have escaped the heat of the mid-Atlantic states, and others have just socialized too much during the first half and realize they are running out of time. Is it wrong for me to feel resentment that they are competing for the campsites? It's almost the reverse of beginning in Georgia with the hordes. Well, not quite as bad as that, but still. This non-traditional flip flopper is feeling oddly territorial.","Monson, ME

SOBOs (recent NOBO flipfloppers)A mouse kept me awake most of the night. At various intervals, I could hear it scurrying around the tent, playing with the pot cozie or in my pack. I finally moved the pack with the food bag in the tent with me—which is a real trick as my tent is a coffin-shaped solo. I had to sleep in the fetal position or have me feet lay on top of the pack so it could fit inside. This morning I discovered it had got in the food bag and chewed through a chicken pasta dinner, spilling the contents of an oil packet. So I didn't wake up in a very good mood. But my shirt was dry.Which may be a reason why the trail felt like work. We didn't pass by any ponds, but did climb five summits. It was pretty tiring. Spirit likes to tell me about the elevation changes and when the trail gets easier, but I tend to look at the whole thing as miles to tick off. And all I wanted to do was tick off miles today to get that much closer to Katahdin. We pushed on for another 2.5 miles, past the last officiating tent site and are stealth camping by a brook. Decided to eat the mouse-tampered dinner after all. It was still tasty and thus far not poisoning me. 1200 miles in the books finished somewhere today.","Cloud Pond Shelter

SOBOs and section hikersThe ninety-percent chance of overnight rain really delivered. It poured and poured. And splashed and splashed—up under the tarp and onto the bug screen and into my tent. Things were a little damp this morning outside and in.The climb away from our brook side campsite followed the brook for a while before veering upward to the first of four of today's mountains. With the exception of 3650-foot Whitecap Mountain, the topography didn't look as challenging as yesterday's elevation changes. Plus today was much cooler. Even wintry. But I'm getting ahead of myself.The rain ended before dawn and first breakfast was able to be eaten outside while we packed up. Because of all of the morning climbs, I stuck with my wool t-shirt uniform even though it was misting—or more likely—we were hiking up into a cloud. Made good time and stopped for second breakfast at the shelter just under four miles up the trail. It was cool once we stopped hiking, the trees were still dripping and and it was still misting. Climbed the next three mountains—still in the t-shirt. As we approached Whitecap, the clouds became thicker and the SOBOs mentioned how windy it was at the summit. I noticed they were all wearing their rain coats or puffy jackets. That should have been a clue. Also, the summit was above tree line. Spirit was waiting for me in the mists and we took a few photos before she headed on and I took the opportunity to make some calls since I had reception. I put on my own rain jacket and texted a few messages before my fingers got to cold. Then I headed around the mountain. And was nailed by a blast of arctic wind. The trail at is point, above tree line, was not unlike parts of the Whites—rocky. It was not only hard to gain footing, but now the wind even preventing footing from easily happening. And the treelike below seemed to take forever to reach—but not as long as it did coming down from Mt. Madison. Also unlike Mt. Madison, there was a long stone stairway installed by the Maine Trail Maintenance Crew. It had to be at least a quarter mile long and hundreds of steps. Hence while the descent was long, it was fairly civilized. One of the calls I made from Whitecap was to make a booking at the White House Landing bunk, 30 miles distant, for tomorrow night. We've been hearing how flat and easy it will be to finish off the 100 Mile Wilderness, which—side note—is not all that remote. Besides the trail magic, we've crossed a few roads. My thought is that the wilderness designation is due to the lack of towns more than anything else. But I digress. We needed to make as many miles today as we could because it could be a long day tomorrow to reach our reservation, if not. Once we hit the flat line, we discovered it was rooty and rocky—and that makes for sore feet and diminished time. At least for me. And worries about how “easy” the trail really will be. The trail wound through a maze of moss-covered boulders, which was exquisite, but the ground was the aforementioned roots and rocks and I was tiring of this. Met up with Spirit again at the river we were supposed to ford, but the low water—even after last night’s rain—allowed us to rock hop across. We pushed on with the goal of another 1.6 miles to a pond. Again Spirit was there first and had scouted out the area. Score! Another awesome stealth site, this one is as good as the East Carry Pond beach site—minus the beach and any other people. The setting sun dried out all our damp gear and soaked tents. I went for my daily swim and continue to get used to swimming in weeds, not many, but still—I’m so happy to be in the water at the end of the day, I'm not caring.","Gulf Hagas Trail Area-Stealth Site

But I really can't complain too much about the day. Sunshine. Breezes. Few bugs. Lakes, streams and waterfalls. And a very flat trail.Did I mention that the trail was as flat as the guidebook indicated? At times it was a nice even pathway. Except for the very last mountain, a 400-foot climb, and a few intermittent places where rocks and roots took over. But it was mostly parklike. Spirit and I were able to do 14 miles in 5 hours. This was a good thing as we needed to make it to the boat dock by 5 p.m. in order to make dinner at the fish camp. At the same time, it was hard work. I haven't done a 20-mile day since Connecticut and my feet now hurt in new and different ways. Back in Virginia, after my first week on the trail, I remember asking two NOBOs when their feet stopped hurting and they said never. Tis true. The one sure thing about this trail is that your feet always hurt.We took quick breaks at the shelters we passed along the trail, stopped for lunch by the lakeside Antler Campsite and I filled up my water bottle at one of the best springs to date—at Potaywadjo Shelter. The icy cold water source rose up through a sandy pool and I loaded up my water bottle.The last few miles were some of the hardest. Our parklike path turned psycho. More moss-covered boulder hopping across muddy trail bits. I felt the bile rising, but that could have been due to not filtering my water at that last spring.Just after 5 p.m., an Alumicraft motor boat whisked us across the lake to a series of cabins nestled around a lodge—all off the grid. Propane powered the hot water, the kitchen stove and the light fixtures. Hammocks, rocking chairs, log benches and the use of canoes or kayaks are available for foot-weary guests. It's too bad we couldn't get here sooner, but it still was great to be able to take a shower, eat a big cheeseburger, drink beer and watch the full moon rise over the darkening lake. Although the breezes have been warm and it is still August, the beech and birch trees are starting to turn and yellow leaves are falling. And there is less daylight left for hiking. Or writing. Musings: My current circle of hikers all include NOBOs ending their hike in the next few days. I haven't been hiking with any Flip Floppers, at least that I know of, since Andover, Maine—more than two weeks ago. Its hard not to get swept up into the NOBO finale and their feelings as their days become numbered.","Mountain View Pond

First of all there remains this little issue of nightly foot pain. Then I could feel every spring in the thin mattress. Finally as I was drifting off to sleep, I thought I was being bitten by no-see-us. Or wait….could there be bedbugs??? Now I really can't fall asleep. Finally got up to take my pink narcotic and crept outside to look at the full moon. There wasn't a breath of air and the lake was flat and glassy. Rabbit came out to look at the night sky while I was up. I resisted asking the time as I was certain he'd tell me it was 2 a.m. or some late hour reinforcing how little sleep I'd be getting. I learned later it was only midnight, so I suppose I hadn't been tossing and turning as much as I thought. One would think that a 20-mile hike would render most people unconscious by the end of the day. Had a lovely big breakfast and subsequently a late start this morning. Not sure if it was the after effects of taking Benadryl or not having taken ibuprofen, but I found the first half of this beautiful Maine summer day to be excruciatingly difficult. The tops of my feet hurt and the trail seemed exceedingly rooty and rocky. We are not pleased. But we did manage to pull off seven miles by lunch, which turned out to be closer to 1 p.m. than noon. The goal was to take a break at the sandy beach of Nahmakanta Lake. Spent an hour there in the company of Bald Whistler, his niece, Cruise Captain and four loons.  Something changed in the afternoon and it wasn't the trail conditions. Perhaps the ibuprofen finally kicked in or the Benadryl cleared out, because I enjoyed the afternoon so much more. We continued to follow lake shorelines, rivers and cascades over roots and rocks all the way to tonight's shelter/campsite area. I kept hoping for—and expecting to find—another stealth site, but this piney tenting area within earshot of the waterfalls will just have to make due. Plus, everyone who stayed at the fish camp is here tonight as well. Plans are beginning to form about pre- and post-summiting. Katahdin is only 30 miles away.","White House Landing/Mahar Tote Road

One of Spirit’s merino wool shirts started ripping two weeks ago too. I wonder why…it's as if I've been wearing it every day for the past 108 days. I put my thumb through the right side as I was pulling it down and two others are developing where runs have been growing on the back for the past month or more. On the upside, this shirt only needs to last two more days before the husband meets me with a wardrobe change. Today's hike is following more than five miles of Rainbow Lake shoreline—again not really wilderness per se. Besides a float plane taking off, a pontoon boat just ferried some people from the remote shoreline fish camp that the AT bypassed by .2-miles. I look at this lake and think I'd definitely rather be paddling it. The trail is more challenging than the flat line profile suggests. Yesterday Spirit and I talked about trail things that will or will not be missed after finishing her hike. The day prior, another NOBO proclaimed he won't at all miss squeezing a water bottle in order to drink safely treated water, putting on damp clothes in the morning or eating peanut butter daily. I, myself, no longer care for toe socks—even if they do a great job of keeping blisters at bay. They are tedious and take on that lovely boys locker room aroma faster and worse than regular socks. Who knew???Even though Spirit and I don't typically hike the entire day together—especially with this orthopedically-challenged older demographic—I suggested that we make a point of hiking solo as the time winds down. When I started this trip, I almost always hiked solo and as I've written before, my flip flop itinerary separated me from the larger established NOBO tramilies. I now can see how fluid, temporary, yet potentially long-lasting these relationships can be. Four of the people that Spirit started out with back in February are now all together and planning to summit on the same day. Last night she and Rabbit determined that they may only have actually camped together for two nights, yet their shared time and overlapping friends have woven their stories together. Today is unusual for me for two reasons—first of all after meeting up with Spirit at regular intervals on a daily basis for nearly a month, we are hiking solo. We met up tonight, but the day was back to our own agendas—and right now mine is spending a good chunk of time writing this entry from an awesome stealth camp on the north end of Rainbow a Lake. Second: my phone is almost dead. I'm not listening to music or podcasts, a crutch I've probably been leaning too heavily over the last month, but this also means that I'm not taking any photos. Maybe I'm better able to absorb more of my immediate surroundings. Nah…still concentrating on my footing—avoiding those blasted roots and rocks. A group of us has been camping together each night for several nights, in secluded locations in quiet woods. After all these miles and fighting less than perfect trail conditions, we abruptly now find ourselves immediately immersed back in what most people think is modern camping. Here at Abol Bridge there are radios, raucous laughter, bright lights and loud conversations happening (gasp!) way past 9 p.m. It's also Saturday night. Nothing subtle at all about this re-entry. On the other hand, all my hiking clothes are clean and dry and I don't have to sleep with a damp shirt being dried by body heat in the foot of my sleeping bag tonight.One finale day of hiking before summiting.","Rainbow Stream Shelter, ME

Sam is on his way to meet me at 4 p.m. Or at least that is what we both assume since neither of us has had phone coverage the past three days while he drove from Wisconsin via Canada to Maine. Because the miles were short and the trail actually was flat for the first time in days—and at least for the first few miles—Spirit and I took several breaks. The first was around the three mile mark only a little over an hour of hiking and under some pine trees along the West Branch of the Penobscot River. We watched a flotilla of rubber rafting boats glide by and chatted up theological perspectives. Just another Sunday morning in Maine. Pine Point, a smooth granite outcrop on Nesowadnehunk Stream, lured us in for a second break only 1.2 miles later. Having already eaten second breakfast, it was time for the leftover IPA. But first, the clean scrubbed boulder worked well for a few forced perspective photos of bottle and yoga.Lunch was at scenic Big Niagara Falls. Flip-flopped attired day hikers (not to be confused with flip flopping hikers) also shared the vista—and yes, a parking lot was not far away. But first, a few more roots and rocks on the last three miles of the AT for you hikers. Arrived at Katahdin Stream where we met up with a freshly summited Purples and her Dad, “Blue” and Slug. And now we wait to see if Sam shows up. And at 4 p.m., just as planned, he did. Along with a hiker to whom he had given a ride. Introductions, some celebrations, some talk about tomorrow's weather and postponing our summit day to catch a clear day, and off we go to Millinocket. Spirit, Purples and Blue are staying at the hostel and Sam and I at an inn—as soon as we eat some pre-summit lobster.","Abol Bridge, ME

It was clear and sunny, I was with members of my tramily and my husband was by my side. In short, an epic day.Sam and were qued twenty cars deep and hadn't passed through the park gate until 7 a.m. Then there was the matter of obtaining the AT thru-hiker permit which I hadn't been able to procure upon arrival two days earlier. Then the ranger was out of the office posting a trailhead weather report. It wasn't until 7:45 a.m. that we finally on the trail.The 5.2-mile trail was a summary of the past four months—flat, well-tramped dirt, roots, rocks, boulder scrambling and climbing. It followed a cascading brook, passed through birches, beeches and maples, then pines and Krummholz finally emerging above tree line. As has been our pattern since Gorham, New Hampshire, Spirit arrived first—and waited for me to show up. I met Cruise Director a few tenths of a mile short of the summit. She told me it was both pretty cold at the top and that Spirit had collapsed at the foot of the iconic terminus sign sobbing. My pace quickened. Since the Whites, after nearly 1300 miles and 110 days of hiking, I’ve been contemplating that Maine might very well be the end for me. I’m tired of wearing the same frequently damp clothes, pulling on a wet bra each morning. I resent many parts of the trail’s foot-bruising and soul-wrenching architecture giving me the distinct impression designers could paint a white blaze on virtually any uneven surface knowing full well hikers will follow them like lemmings—and like lemmings, the trail has taken us over cliffs. Those blazes lead over some of the most untrail-like trails I've ever seen. And, once I started passing by—and often swimming—in the northern lakes, I started to fantasize about my two year-old solo canoe that's been shelved all season, taking my remaining food and heading up to the Boundary Waters for a few weeks yet this fall. I could be in actual wilderness and be on the water vs. concerned with finding and carrying it. And the elevation changes are comparably null. And then there is family. I’d be home sooner to see that rapidly changing new grandson. And so as I started to pull ahead of Sam, marching up over the littered rocks toward that sign, and searching for Spirit within the crowd, my heart was full of conflict. I expected to burst into tears. I expected an answer to become clear. Instead. Spirit waved to me and gave me a hug that will last a lifetime. We laughed and then I said I had to touch that sign that was still a few yards away. Quite likely, but apologetically, we jumped into line and took summit photos. We ate lunch protected by rocks out of the wind. And then we headed back down. I'm writing this post from the shores of Moosehead Lake, less than fifty miles, but still a few hours drive from Katahdin (because you can't get there from here), and one of the lakes I paddled five years ago. Yesterday, Sam and I hiked up Mt. Kineo with the newlyweds Justine (Miss Daisy) and TK (ATK), who drove up from their homestead about an hour away to spend the day with us. This trip has been remarkable not only in the distance traveled to date, but measured in the relationships amassed over the years and past weeks. From complete strangers who housed me for a weekend; to friends I've known since college who provided the opportunity to slackpack—and wear great loaner clothes; to friends I've only known for a few years who gave me rides, held parties, massaged my feet, shared cabins, hosted me in their B&B and provided moral support; to friends who even had me witness their wedding; to friends back home who have sent notes, cookies, biscotti and even wine; to new friends, united now by our shared experiences traversing the Appalachian Trail, this trip far surpasses a mere backpacking adventure.Sam and I are taking a week heading back to Harpers Ferry where another of my food drops were left in anticipation of my flip—hiking to Georgia and the southern terminus. Like this visit to Moosehead Lake, I want to show him some of my hiking highlights or missed opportunities. We’ll hit Mt. Washington, via (gasp!) the road—where I can only hope to be judged by odiferous thru-hikers, hit the bakeries I missed in Bennington, Vermont and Salisbury, Connecticut and maybe, if I'm feeling particularly forgiving, pass through some of the quaint towns in Rocksylvania. I still don't know what I'll decide to do and probably won't until I see that first blaze where I departed back in April in Shenandoah National Park. What I do know at this point, there is no wrong answer.","Millinocket, ME

Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547331,"I'm known for finishing what I start and am one of those horrible parents that raised the kids with this philosophy—so the thought of, to borrow a current political euphemism, “suspending” my hike, didn't initially sit well with me. I also don't like the idea of becoming a statistic associated with throwing in the towel. But after hiking more than four months, nearly 1300 miles through eleven states and summiting Mt. Katahdin, I decided to head back home rather than flip south to finish the remaining 862 miles from Rockfish Gap, where I began my thru-hike attempt on April 11. There were several contributing factors, but the nail in the coffin remains the reality I wouldn't be able to finish hiking the entire length within the window of time I had available to do it this year. The most miles I hiked in one day was just under twenty-one. As recently as Day 106, I hiked over twenty miles, but that took all day and my feet were mutinous. I didn't want to force myself into a situation where I’d have to sustain high mileage averages for the sole purpose of finishing on time—even if that were possible. And, there has been that persistently buzzing bee in my bonnet or—as “Purples” would call it—my macro lesson: I prefer being on water vs. being concerned about where to find and carry it. Maine was an affirmation. Two of my best stealth campsites were along shorelines. I longingly gazed at Mooselookmeguntic, Rangeley and Flagstaff lakes, lakes that I have already paddled, as I hiked past them. I let the lakes seduce me. My thoughts began fomenting a wilderness canoe trip this fall in Minnesota instead of hiking yet more elevation changes in pursuit of white blazes—and knowing I'd still need to come back to finish.Finally, all my trail companions, since Andover, Maine, have either been Northbound thru-hikers who were ending their hikes atop Katahdin or section hikers. It wasn't hard to become swept up into their finish feelings. I do wonder had I been traveling with a group of Flip Floppers, or even buddied up with another hiker following a similar itinerary, if my enthusiasm for the trail and a drive to finish would have endured. Turns out summiting Katahdin did feel like an ending. Nah…I blame it on my horoscope. I'm a Pisces. It's the lure of water. My husband and I took our time heading back to Harpers Ferry where a food drop was left in anticipation of my flip. We zig-zagged through the Northeast, crossing the trail and visiting some of my hiking highlights and missed opportunities as part of my bakery/brewery/ice cream walking tour. After visiting the trail head near Monson, where a friend had geocached a surprise for me to discover at the base of the sign post, day one included a stop for lunch at the the Kennebec River Pub and Brewery near Carrautunk, Maine. We continued on to Gorham, New Hampshire camping that night at the base of the Whites. The next morning we stopped at the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center and then drove through clouds on the auto road to the top of a very obscured Mt. Washington This time, there were few tourists and no line to take summit photos. I also think I threw up a little in the back of my throat showing Sam the “trail” leading toward Mt. Madison.I pointed out mountains and notches as we meandered through the rest of the state, then Vermont and Bennington, a town I hadn't visited on my way through. Sigh…we arrived too late at the Crazy Russian Girls Bakery. We headed down to North Adams, Massachusetts, spending the night with the same friends who put up with me for four days back in June. Day three following Route 7 brought us through Great Barrington, Massachusetts and Connecticut with stops at the Sweet William Bakery and White Hart Inn and Taproom in Salisbury and ice cream at Annie Bananie in Kent. Until we reached Pennsylvania, we meandered through New York hitting the Bulls Bridge covered bridge, through Fahnestock State Park and around Canopus Lake, over the Bear Mountain Bridge and along the Palisades Parkway adjacent to Harriman. We finally took to the Interstate where billboards and traffic assaulted my senses, and stopped for the night back at Common Ground Farm and Retreat Center, near the Eckville Shelter in Pennsylvania. Day four was D-Day. But by now, I knew the answer. After stopping for lunch and Yuenglings at a surprisingly quiet Doyle Hotel in Duncannon, Pennsylvania, we picked up my resupply the ATC headquarters in Harper's Ferry and headed back to Wisconsin.It's been less than 24-hours since I returned home and for the first and only time on this trip, I awoke in the middle of the night not knowing where I was—ironically in my very own bed. I shocked my parents by showing up at their house this morning (which is a reason I didn't want to post this update sooner.) I’ve washed my sleeping bag, put a few things away and took a yoga class revealing still very sore toes and knees. I have welcome messages chalked on my driveway and a lovely cake decorated with a backpacking/kayaking/camping/head-banded Barbie made by my neighbors. The door hasn't been closed to finishing next year, but for now I’m heading off to sneak in that canoe trip in the Boundary Waters before my friends and clients get wind that I’m back.Thank you for following me and for your comments. I read them all.","Baxter Peak, Katahdin

Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548066,"First of all, thank you for your kind words of support after announcing my decision to leave the trail, as well as the encouraging comments to continue writing. I am now seriously considering becoming a LASH (Long Ass Section Hiker—no earthly idea why “A” was a necessary addition to this acronym, except it needed a vowel) and finishing next year, so I will keep this journal going for as long as it seems reasonable.It is the eve of my post-Appalachian Trail self-rediscovery tour back in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW). Let's see how much I really love large lakes. I'll be paddling on more than a few of them. Since summiting Katahdin, I’ve spent the past two weeks visiting family, re-evaluating what I like and don't like about our house and planning this 130-mile paddle trip. (Apparently the mileage for both my major trips this year must include the numeral “13” followed by a zero or two.) I also hit a yoga class, but my knees and toes informed me that. It. Is. Just. Too. Soon. I continued to think about painting rooms, making beef jerky and reorganizing my leftover backpacking meals.Tonight finds me happily ensconced within a $19 outfitter’s bunkhouse in Ely, Minnesota—436 miles and seven hours, by car that is, from my home in Wisconsin. Like boots and backpacks lined up outside a hostel’s door, the sight of a disproportionately high number of vehicles, with canoes strapped to their roofs lining the streets of Ely, cheers my little paddling heart. And even though I’m the only one staying here tonight, it feels as comfortable as any trail town lodging—right down to the pinned wall map (although of course, it is of northern lakes and not a certain eastern trail,) mismatched common room chairs and familiar plastic covered mattresses. Bless their little hostel hearts.Canoeing gear differs a bit from backpacking. For one thing, the ultralight 68 liter ULA Circuit pack and food bag has been replaced with a 70 liter waterproof rubberized SealLine dry bag AND a 30 liter blue plastic food BARREL, the latter crammed full of ramen recipes, tortillas and jerky, among other things. The dry bag is weighing in at just under thirty pounds—so I guess that isn't too bad. I’m packing about twice as many clothes—both for the fall temperatures and because there is always a possibility of a dunking when you spending the majority of your time on lakes and rivers. There are no resupply stops, hotels, hostels or even shelters where I’m headed for the next fifteen days. And where I’m headed is literally water that separates the U.S. and Canada. (See what they did? Such a clever eponym, “boundary waters,” indeed.) My usual luxury item, a pillow, this one a micro-suede covered, compressible Thermarest model, is almost twice as big as the nylon, inflatable version I carried out East. Then there is the larger—and heavier—Goretex rain jacket AND rain pants, because you can't get much wetter than sitting out like a duck on an open lake, during a cloudburst in a vessel that collects and holds water. Unless you find yourself in the lake. In pouring rain. I’ve also packed my more spacious two-person Mountain Hardware tent which, after carrying the 13-oz., one-person Tarp Tent Notch for the past four months, appears to have turned into a sack of cement. But heck, this is the tent that’s been to the BWCAW many times before. Apparently I will manage. Another difference? Way fewer people. The Boundary Waters requires that you camp at designated campsites. These appear as red dots on the large plastic topographic maps and are typically obvious as you approach them from the water. Unlike AT shelters and campsites, if a BWCAW site is occupied, the courteous thing to do is to paddle on in search of an open one. So instead of finding a little temporary village assembled at the end of each day, I’ll be camping alone every night. I'll see other paddlers on the water and perhaps cross paths while portaging, but there is a very high likelihood that I'll rarely speak to another person for the next two weeks.If that doesn't sound like a whale of a time, there is still some hiking to be had. It's not all floating fun and games. This route includes 51 portages (the trails that connect unconnected lakes or bypasses dangerous rapids or obstructions). The upside is that my longest portage is no more than one-half mile. There will be the carrying of the gear, but not nearly as efficient or—and this may come as a shock—as light—as backpacking. Transporting a canoe, paddles, large dry bag and a food barrel ensures that I will be making two trips over every portage—tripling each distance. And while the geology of the Canadian Shield is such that not all the land surrounding the lakes is flat, the elevation changes aren't nearly as drastic as Appalachia profiles. Or as sustained. My hands will only be needed to steady the canoe being balanced upon my shoulders, not clutch a rock face as I heave my body up over a giant monolith. Unless I climb the smooth granite ledges of Warrior Hill, on the Canadian side of Lac La Croix. In which case I will not be carrying any gear, but will still to be concerned about falling—into the hands of any border patrol, that is. And you won't find about that for a few weeks since there is also no electricity or WiFi up here in these there parts. At least I only expect to be off the grid for a few weeks. Then I need to get some rooms repainted. Side note: For those of you familiar with the BWCAW, or even for those of you who aren't, I'm entering through Crane Lake, permit entry point #12/Little Vermillion Lake adjacent to Voyaguer National Park. From Lac La Croix, I'll be dropping into the interior through Iron Lake and the Basswood River, looping through Horse, Fourtown and Stuart and eventually returning back through Loon Lake to Little Vermillion and Crane.","Green Bay, Wisconsin

Arachne,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550933,"PrologueNote: This is a copy of the same essay I posted on the Appalachian Trial's site where I've also been blogging.I've been home for more than a few weeks now—restarting my Y membership, resuming yoga classes, our Wednesday date night. Returning to work. I ended up paddling and portaging more than 150 miles in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness immediately following an Appalachian Trail thru-hike attempt—and rounding out an indelible six-month journey. Author Michael Perry writes after a recent book tour: “There is a feeling that I am back where I belong but still decelerating. So many miles, so many faces, now I’m back at my desk [sic], going nowhere.”Yup.September 8—23, 2016This. Trip. Is. So. Different. My self-imposed exile, smack on the heels of a longer separation from civilized society, is a new undertaking—a boundless, yet solitary confinement. With hundreds of lakes and miles of paths connecting waterways, and without towns for resupply, I carry everything I will need for sixteen days in a 16’ canoe. There isn't a straight line to follow and no place I need to be. I meander through rivers and lakes, passing waterfalls and portaging through boreal forests. I catch myself watching cloud formations and gazing for hours atop primordial bedrock as the sun liquefies into vast expanses of inland seas—sunsets that rival any exotic ocean coastline.I am far more alone over these last two weeks than on any of the 110 days spent hiking the Appalachian Trail solo. I have to rely on compass and maps in this blaze-less backcountry. I have to pay attention to the wind. A light zephyr might ripple the surface. Gusts whipping through pine trees could mean rolling waves or wind-binding white caps. My eyes strain looking. So far. So hard. At the horizon. At the sky.This route began at the western-most entry to the wilderness, Little Vermillion Lake, adjacent to Voyager National Park in northern Minnesota. I follow a twenty-five mile section of horseshoe-shaped Lac La Croix, one of a handful of large, narrow border country waters that separate the United States and Canada. I ponder how this permeable aquatic line of demarcation could never support a wall. The lakes here are dotted with islands, their rugged granite shorelines containing hues of greens, pinks and more shades of gray than any cheesy novel could possibly imagine.This late in the summer, voracious bugs are non-existent and northern birds are beginning their annual fall migrations. Audible flocks of Canadian geese gather each evening amidst neighboring wetlands and during the day I repeatedly paddle beneath swelling V formations. Clusters of Common Goldeneye ducks whistle overhead. Emerging from a reedy creek outlet on Sunday Lake, I disturb a pair of Tundra swans, the first time I’ve seen any here in the BWCAW. A day later, a second pair surprise me as I round a bend along the Beartrap River, tufts of white feathers festoon the marshy shoreline in their haste to put distance between us. Loons are still present, but quieter. One day I passively sit watching a parent feeding a juvenile only a boat length away. On my last morning back on the serendipitously named “Loon Lake,” eight of these solitary birds together take flight.I find myself chatting it up to everyone on the portage trails or if passing by close enough to initiate a conversation. I ask the still familiar thru-hiker trail questions: Where are you from? (Oklahoma, Kansas City, Idaho, New Mexico, Maine, Washington, Colorado!) Where did you put in? How long are you out for? And, unique to this trip, how's the fishing?At the end of day four, I had stumbled upon a five-star campsite after paddling for hours against headwinds. There were only a handful of campsites scattered between several islands, all occupied. At the last, I asked if there might be room for me in what looked to be a large site. Unlike the designated shelters and tent sites located all along the Appalachian Trail, where hikers gather nightly forming small villages, campsites in the BWCAW typically are occupied only by a single party. Turns out there were four women—three sisters and a close friend—who were out for a few days. This campsite had been a favorite childhood destination, nestled among towering pine trees, with not one, but two, sandy beaches, a west-facing, wind-washed granite outcrop and a protected “kitchen” area surrounding the fire grate. In over 25 years of visiting the Boundary Waters, I rarely cross paths with all female groups. Sharing this—coincidentally spectacular—site for the night, with these friends from Minnesota, was especially welcoming. Plus their food bag held more than lightweight dinners. A chocolate cake materialized from a Dutch oven and shared as Venus rose low over the horizon and glowing embers turned to ash.But mostly, I’m alone.At night, I still have to convince myself that a tree won't suddenly fall on me while I'm asleep or that the noise I hear by my head is only a mouse and not a bear. Or an alien. Okay, it's mostly concerns about trees. But on this trip there have been a surprisingly high number of mice rivaling the numbers appropriating the shelters and campsites in Maine. Perhaps it has something to do with being in the same latitude—or the time of year? With the exception of a stealth camp I had to pitch after a 20-mile day and no nearby campsites, all of the established Boundary Water campsites have been overrun with mice. These northern mice are equally as fearless as their eastern cousins. I've been awoken by their ramblings and watched them run up and over my tent through the mosquito netting. Cheeky bastards. I've long ago realized that bears aren't a threat. Or aliens—at least yet. But mice? Absolutely.A week later, I return to find the same rock-star island campsite I shared with the women unoccupied. Tonight, mice are my only companions. And there is no fresh-baked cake for dessert. I had hoped to spend the afternoon drying out gear while hanging out on one of the sandy beaches, but instead I watch curtains of isolated showers roll across the lake from the vestibule of my heavy two-person tent. I arose uncharacteristically early the next morning—well before the red squirrels and crow alarm clocks. Thick fog blurred the spaces between air, rock and water. The quiet was absolute. A solitary bald eagle aimlessly wafts overhead, the rhythmic swish of pinion feathers barely breaking the stillness. Slowly landmasses begin to emerge as diffused sunlight penetrates the mists. I hear the conversations of my closest neighbors more than a quarter mile away camped on another island. Blue grey gives way to yellow grey. Individual clouds become defined as the fog lifts from the lake to reveal sky the color of a robin’s egg. Now I can see not one faint island, but four.Sacrilegiously, I fire up the canister stove for coffee. The sound cuts through the silence as piercingly as a welder’s acetylene torch.Despite the geography and time, the differences between these two trips, hiking and paddling, are few but notable.My gear is heavier—I packed a larger tent, more clothes and thick neoprene boots that keep my feet warm while plodding through watery and muddy autumnal portages. But, they never completely dry out. Instead of the locker room ammonia smell emanating from my backpack and sweat-soaked hiker clothes, there is a pervasive mildew, musty smell associated with constantly immersed footwear and socks.As a communications device, my phone is completely useless in this part of the world, but it still functions as my camera and carries my iTunes and podcast libraries. It lasts for the duration without electricity thanks to energy saving tips I picked up while hiking and because I carry a small charger. But listening to my playlist is very different this time around. During the day hiking the Appalachian Trail, music helped keep me motivated. Or perhaps more to the point—distracted. But listening to the same music in the tent at night alone here in the Boundary Waters makes me feel melancholy and missing all things home. Like hiking, I still observe hiker’s midnight—especially now that the days are getting shorter and the nights cooler. But nights are now especially long.The time of year and the lack of elevation changes also means I am less sweaty. Of course the proximity of buoyant waters ensure I am able to get in my beloved daily dips and swims—especially in campsites with actual beaches. Well, that was, until the temperature inversion. My trip started with daytime highs still reaching the seventies. The water was warm and at times, warmer than the air. But each fall, as air cools the upper layer of water, and as it reaches it’s most dense state, it then sinks to the bottom—a semi-annual phenomenon commonly referred to as a lake rollover. After several nights where I found myself needing my puffy jacket and wool long underwear, the water temperature turned decidedly colder. Still, I could splash my face without worrying about dipping into precious liters of a survival reserve.By the end of the fifteen days, I have consumed all my pre-made hiking dinners and my feet are no longer as painful despite traversing more than forty portages, all of which had to be hiked twice. On the first trip, I carried the 70-liter rubberized dry bag and loose gear (paddles, thwart bag and that insanely heavy tent) and on the second, the canoe and food barrel. Most of the portages were an eighth of a mile or less in duration, but three of the forty were sneaking up to a mile long. Soreness in my back and shoulders have replaced the foot pain, but it’s only a sign of muscles being rediscovered, not a harbinger of injury.I observe things that fill my time, but miss sharing these moments with other people in the spaces in between. Bald eagles make daily appearances. Two adults fight on a rocky profuse while a juvenile or two shrieked from towering white pines near a campsite on Boot Lake. Another day I shadow three otters as we all wind through a narrow passage on Lac La Croix. Beaver become nightly entertainment—private performances for an audience of one. I paddle past two displays of pictoglyphs—ancient paintings of moose and pelicans and even handprints—visible from the canoe upon granite faces of Lac La Croix and Basswood Lake vertical cliffs.One night I fall asleep to the sound of rain and later awake to discover the full moon brilliantly illuminating the clouds. I think it is dawn. It was only 1:30 a.m.Another night a bear spooks me on Agnes Lake. I really would have preferred to share that particular experience with another person. I wish I could report I had been pleased to see it. In broad daylight. From the seat of my canoe. But no, the bear appeared just as I was ready to go to bed, not fifteen feet away from my tent. I later learned it had visited two other campsites in the area. A sleepless night was spent needlessly worrying about the food barrel hung from the only practical tree branch—much too close to the tent and looking for all the world like a big blue plastic piñata it could easily have become.By the twelfth night and craving company, I wanted to call out to passing canoes that it would be okay to camp with me—a feeling probably not shared by people who likely had been immersed within this wilderness only a short time. I catch myself starting to count the days down.On one hand I need to appreciate this rare opportunity to travel so far, propelled only by my physical endurance and desire, while divorced from the constraints of “real” life. How often does one receive this gift of time, this gift of solitude? On the other hand, I look forward to once again using soap.PostscriptAs weeks turn into months, sometimes it seems like I never hiked 1300 miles. Although as of this post, I am reminded that yes, indeed I did. I still have thousands of photos to sort. I still feel the occasional ache in my left foot and both big toes still go numb from time to time. Despite the fact that I had an equally awesome post-AT canoe trip, I may even be suffering from a little post-trail blues. I jealously follow hikers—friends and strangers alike—still out on the trail finishing up their flip-flops or SOBOs, yet knowing I wouldn’t have been able to finish with the pain I was experiencing and in the time I had left. Regardless, there is joy to be found living in the moment while at the same time constantly planning for the future. I am back where I belong—wherever that may be.Until the next adventure…","Boundary Waters, MN

This morning I dressed in a newer moss colored merino wool shirt, the second of two Ibex shirts I had bought on sale at the end of 2015. The gray one made it 1300 miles last year, before increasingly thinning fabric reduced it to shreds. I'm yet reluctant to give it up. It witnessed cloudless skies, crystalline lakes and exhilarating heights. It also was routinely drenched in rain and sweat, and saw me through all of my lowest lows. 
I’m heading back today to finish what was started last year—865 or so miles left of what has turned into a LASH (Long Ass Sectional Hike) of the Appalachian Trail. Flying out of Milwaukee was less than one third of the cost of flying direct out of Green Bay, but without the convenience of being able to choose a seat. I occupy 39E, the very last seat on this flight, one of five lacking amenities, such as reclining seats. And a window. 
Yet some people find the idea of hiking challenging? 
I sent my stove, small knife and other possibly perceived sharp objects that I didn't wish to risk confiscation (like my umbrella) ahead to the woman who is meeting me in Atlanta and taking me to Amicalola State Park. I thought I might attempt taking my pack on the plane as carry-on, but wasn't sure my trekking poles would be allowed on. Or the tent stakes once I remembered those. That bright yellow and red bulk toilet paper Sam’s Club commodity box I decided to use for checked luggage will be easy to spot on the baggage claim carousel.
Crystal (Giver) is a fellow 2016 Appalachian Trials blogger. She completed more than 600 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail last summer before medical conditions took her off trail. She lives in Atlanta and after seeing my post in our mutual Facebook Group page inquiring about shuttle experiences and options from Atlanta, she offered to pick me up herself. 
I'm arriving this year five pounds lighter than April 2016, so some of the 20 or 25 pounds I lost last year managed to stay off. Curse you holiday food, craft beer and cold Wisconsin winters! I'm also arriving with a very different mind set. Last year was full of expectant posts and preparations. I made a big deal about announcing my plans—partially due in part to the much longer planned leave of absence (five or six months vs 10 or so weeks). This year there were no pre-trip posts, fewer lists made for my husband (the plants all survived) and I'm not sure if even all of my family members knew I was heading back. I mean, I'll be back for most of the summer. 
I’m starting out again with all the same gear, packing it all the same way, wearing most of the same clothes and more or less ready to just show up and follow white blazes. I’m wearing the same “camping-only” undies still bearing the hydrochloric acid markings of an unfortunately squished giant millipede inadvertently sat upon at the Mashipacong Shelter back in New Jersey. That‘s one reason these only get hauled out for camping trips. And I’m still sporting the kid’s BatMan bracelet Dysfungshenal found on the trail while we were hung together somewhere in New York. 
My most pressing concerns remain trying to recall all the tricks to keep my phone battery from dying and getting used to typing on a tiny keypad again.
Update: Most of this was written earlier today from the confines of Seat 39E. Crystal has since found me at Delta passenger pick-up area, slacked and hiked with me for the first mile up the Approach Trail and deposited me at the door of my first campsite, the Amicalola Lodge. It was overcast when I landed, but clear and sunny when we reached the park. I registered as a section hiker. If I had been a thru-hiker, the number was up to 1,987. I find myself in a categorical limbo. Like Katahdin, I received no assigned AT thru-hiker number documenting my summit day because I hadn't started in Georgia. Now I’m in Georgia heading north equally traveling beneath the Appalachian Trail Conservancy statistical radar. But no matter. I'm here. 
As a Georgian, Crystal was able to check out a state park vehicle pass from her local library, a perk the state of Georgia offers residents—and one that is completely foreign to this tax-paying, public lands using Wisconsinite. We entered the park around 3 p.m., parked the car and walked the 600 stairs following the 729-foot cascading waterfall up to its narrow little brook source. After taking lots of pictures we then headed back down and said goodbye at my first campsite—the Amicalola Lodge. I'm roughing it in a king size bed tonight. But tomorrow? Tomorrow’s the real deal.","Amicalola State Park

Tuesday, May 2, 2017Amicalola Falls Lodge to Hawk Mountain Tentsites (Milepost 7.5)Miles: 7.5-Approach Trail/7.5-AT miles—15 miles total in 9 hours with four breaks2017 AT miles: 7.5Total AT miles to date: 1301.6Weather: Clear skies, cool breeze in the morning, but warm, sunny—high in the upper 60sWildlife: Interesting songbirds (I think some warblers and finches), Barred Owl heard while setting up campDinner: Pepper Fish and PastaHikers: Lots of day hikers, a few sectional hikers, several thru-hikers and a couple of knuckleheads
As my steadfast reader already knows, we last saw me leave the trail on August 23, after making it to Katahdin, in pain. Mentally finished. Emotionally crippled. Defeated. Whoops—I got carried away. Scratch those last two points. 
I was emotional, but not crippled and the pain turned out to be temporary. Like childbirth. How quickly we forget. And then we do it all over again. 
Before heading out, I first tortured myself one last time by watching the TV morning news where I learned that the architect behind the mass relocation and extermination of America’s indigenous peoples in the mid-19th century “had a really big heart.” Yeah, I’m definitely not going to miss my seemingly daily dose of 140 character Orwellian revisionist history lessons. 
Forced down a breakfast of hotel room coffee, an apple I hadn't eaten yesterday and a bun and chocolate chip cookie nabbed from last night's all-you-can-eat buffet and was on the trail at 7 a.m. Well, the Approach Trail, that is. From the lodge it's a 7.5 mile hike to Springer Mountain where the AT actually begins. You can drive Forest Service roads to reach Springer as well, but for those thru-hikers, you then need to hike one mile from the parking lot to the terminus, then turn around and hike back exactly the way you just came picking up the trail from the opposite side of the parking lot. As I'm a person who detests backtracking, hiking in one direction, even though it added “warm-up”miles, suited me just fine.
Whenever I've seen photos of the Springer Mountain plaques atop the southern terminus, they have been surrounded by lots of people. When I arrived just before 11 a.m. no one was there. I took pictures, then, because my breakfast had lacked a certain heartiness, I sat down to eat an early lunch. People did arrive while I was there, but nothing I would describe as crowds. So that was nice. Throughout the day I leapfrogged with a couple from Florida and another older man. But like last year, there was a village of ripstop nylon numbering at least ten parties at the designated tentsites. So there is still are plenty of hikers.
Today's hike was nothing short of epic. The weather was perfect. Today's trails were nice—pines, rhododendrons, mixed softwoods. And it was easy enough that I exceeded my original 8-10 mile plan. There was water literally springing up from the ground, clear creeks and a blue blazed side trail, that I was happy I decided to visit. While I don't condone craving, I was sort of glad someone scratched in “only 150 steps.” Long Falls came toward the end of the day around mile 12 and at that point, I debated about seeing it. The Florida couple bypassed it and missed probably the best thing on the trail today, not counting the Springer Mountain terminus. Water cascaded over vertical bedrock. It wasn't particularly high, but it had a lot of rocky texture. I took my shoes off and let my feet soak for a long time. 
Arrived at camp at 4:15. The Florida couple and I had run into some trail maintainers who advised us to stop at the newer campground prior to reaching the Hawk Mountain Shelter, which was old and filling up. This 30-site area was established last year to handle the increasing number of hikers who start out from Springer. One of the better amenities was a bear box, a reinforced locked metal cabinet about the size of an oversized coffee table—and much better than hanging food from a branch, and a newer composting toilet. Composting toilets are commodes that are built up on a platform but are open air beneath. The user space is quite private but the “deposit” area is somewhat exposed. Generally they are situated out of site, on a path behind a shelter. In this campground, however, the privy was trailside and ascent to site #9.
The camping was pretty fine except for the yahoos camped next to the privy, burning plastic and lighting off fire crackers. Besides their questionable choice of location, they had camp chairs and a big can of insect repellent with which one of the fine gents was dosing himself. For my part, I haven't noticed any bugs.
What I almost did neglect to notice was the sun. Last night I looked at my arms and thought--that's weird, they looked sunburned. And yes, indeed. Just one late afternoon hour spent climbing stairs yesterday tinged my winter washed skin pink. 
So to recap. Gorgeous day. Good miles. Little pain. No bugs.","Amicalola Falls Lodge

Fell asleep to a cacophony of Barred Owls. And helicopters. I forgot the Hawk Mountain is close to some military base where night time maneuvers are practiced. I had fallen asleep well before 9 to the sounds territorial owls and the knuckleheads breaking an otherwise silent campground with raucous laughter, but was jolted awake by the buzz of overhead choppers. At one point I just decided to pretend it was thunder. 
My night was still restless even after the M.A.S.H. episode ended and was awake before 6 a.m. But 6 a.m. here is still dark. I did some writing, took my time making breakfast and before you knew it, it was 7:45. And I still was one of the first hikers out of camp, passing by the Florida couple who were in the midst of packing.
The trail again was really pleasant. I'm liking Georgia thus far—even with the first few Pointless Ups and Downs (PUDs) named Sassafras and Justus. I even heard a proverbial tree fall in the woods. It did make a noise. The rest of the day was spent leapt frogging three guys and two of them are staying at the same hostel tonight. I hadn't seen many other people until the last mile or two, including the guy who looked to be post-70, impressively running down the trail, in the opposite direction, with a pack, and telling us how many people he's seen today as he passed by. 
It got hot this afternoon, but I gotta say I still feel remarkably good starting out with the miles I've covered these past two days. And now I've probably just jinxed myself, but I'm gonna give credit to Glucosamine. I started taking it a month before I left and am finishing off the bottle as I hike. Thus far, legs and back feel good. Feet? Meh. A little. In January I finally visited a sports med physician who ruled out any stress fractures—so only a little overuse. Also, I apparently have the beginnings of claw foot, which might explain the tendon issues on the top of my left foot last year. But that's genetics not the AT.
The hostel here is full tonight—with a mix of characters. Because it is located closer to Springer Mountain by road than trail, people often start here after arriving from their home states—and two people are heading out tomorrow. There’s a woman who started on Sunday after school finished, and is here to take her finals online tomorrow, a father and daughter doing a section together, and an older man, who started 10 days ago and is averaging 2-5 miles per day. He took a zero yesterday.
I'm happy to report that my One Pot Taco dinner is as tasty as I remember it and I'm pleased I packed one in each of my food drops. At least for now. In theory. 
So. Another fine day in the books. As my friend David would say, “Lucky.”","Hawk Mountain Tentsites

While this day would seemingly be challenging, it instead was another pretty awesome day—in part due to the fact that I'm writing from a cabin, not a shelter, but a cabin. With a bedroom, loft, kitchen and most importantly, heat. The rain is currently hitting it sideways. Best $18 I've ever spent.
After the shuttle driver backed into a tree taking out the right door rear window, Waldo/Bill the Pony, (he hasn't decided on a trail name yet and started in the Smokies in March where the two naming options were first bestowed upon him and is finishing up this section before flipping back up to continue north), Rob and Bethany (father/daughter hikers out for a week), Chuck (the two to five mile per day thru-hiker guy) and I all headed back to the Woody Gap trail head at 9:00. A little late for my tastes and disconcerting—due to the forecast—storms are predicted to arrive late afternoon with gusting winds. 11 miles ahead is Mountain Crossings, an outfitter right on the trail with a 12-bed first-come, first-served bunkhouse. 
Who didn't return to the trail this morning was one of the two guys I had leapfrogged with yesterday and had arrived at the hostel with me. This was really surprising. He was a very steady hiker. The shuttle driver was actually in the process of telling us that this hiker decided to quit and was heading home later that day. Then he nailed the tree. I guess that van won't be used to drive him to the airport. 
The day started out fine, just some light showers. I had my umbrella up and stayed dry. Waldo/Bill the Pony and I fell into step soon after Woody Gap. Today’s section included 4461-foot Blood Mountain, a mountain I have 35mm slide documenting having hiked in 1981. I still can't figure out where I might have started on that spring break college trip. Woody Gap seems possible, but that doesn't add up to a 60-mile Georgia only hike that I thought it was. Remarkably, the trail isn't looking all that familiar. 
With the exception of Big Cedar Mountain, about a 500-foot climb out of Woody Gap, the rest of today's mileage was all about climbing up Blood Mountain and down it to Neels Gap—more than a one thousand feet elevation gain and descent. Waldo/Bill the Pony and I chatted for more than half the distance and we made good time, stopping for lunch at the Woods Hole Shelter where the two section hikers were debating about reserving a cabin tonight. Rain was still light at this point. 
I left first and met up with Rob and Bethany at the Blood Mountain cabin at the summit. They too were talking about trying to get a cabin tonight. So when Waldo/Bill the Pony showed up we collectively decided to get a cabin together if the bunkhouse was full. 
The outside of the stone Blood Mountain shelter is just as the slide shows, but with a fuctional roof and poured concrete floors. It felt slightly familiar, although I do not recall it having two rooms. Unlike 36 years ago, no view this year. The mountain was socked in.
The four of us started down the last 2.4 miles of the day through rhododendrons and over bald rock faces reminiscent of Maine. And within minutes, I slipped on nothing. Like a verifiable hole-in-one, this fall counted. I had witnesses. And felt my crappy left foot twist. I got up and it didn't feel too bad, but as I kept walking down, I noticed a little something something going on around my ankle. 
Arrived at Mountain Crossings, passing under a knarled oak festooned with the footwear of hundreds of hikers who decided hiking the AT was not for them and threw in the towel, or more literally, their boots. Nice shop with tantalizing inventory. At 3 p.m., the bunkhouse was already full. As we were talking about getting to the cabins located .3 miles down the highway, a man with two young daughters overheard us and offered to drive. It was now raining, so we said, “Sure!” Turns out he thru-hiked in the late 90s. We were able to get this place, one of about a dozen plywood paneled housekeeping cabins offered at a reduced walk-up hiker rate of $72. We are in Bear, which is accented with two namesake bearskins hanging opposite the loft. The freezer even has ice. So I am sitting here in relative luxury, eating pizza from the restaurant at the front desk, icing my slightly swollen ankle, watching the rain pour down. And the wind gust. It really looks cold out there. The kids just inserted Ocean Elevens into the video player of the 13” analog TV mounted next to one of the bearskins. I'm telling you—all this and hot water—for only $18 per person. Well the pizza was extra.","Woody Gap/Hiker Hostel

Despite having my own room and queen sized bed, I still didn't sleep soundly, but hey—it wasn't in a cold tent like it is tonight. Kudos to those hikers who were developing lots of character camping out last night. And likely tonight as well. The weather today still called for rain, but not torrential.
My ankle was slightly discolored this morning and definitely slightly sprained, but as it turned out, not incapacitating. 
I returned to Mountain Crossings, where the trail resumes, to buy an elastic brace for my ankle as well as a long sleeve wool shirt. I have a insulating long-sleeve rayon/bamboo shirt for nights in the tent like tonight, but my daytime look—the button down long-sleeve insect shirt wasn't warm enough to wear in the rain and get wet. I tend not to hike in my rain jacket because A) it gets sweaty and B) I use a hiking umbrella which does a fine job of keeping my head and torso dry, but as you might expect, not so much my arms. 
It was so easy to say I just needed a black merino wool long-sleeve shirt. No concern about how it looks. Shopping done! 
Call me crazy, but despite the day-long intermittent showers and cold temps, I still had fun. Or maybe I just had that special feeling you get when you wear new clothes for the first time. Or because it was one of those days when you kinda looked forward to uphill climbs because that's what keeps you warm. 
I also recognized this section of the trail from 36 years ago—just after Low Gap and the shelter passed on the way to tonight's campsite. The trail began following an old road bed and I suddenly remembered that I must have stayed in Low Gap Shelter the eve before deciding I was going to go for the last pick-up point. The trail/road carves into the side of the mountain and you can see the shelter below. I clearly recall frost crystals pushing up dirt and ice formed along the rock face where a little spring was flowing and tonight's dinner water collected.
My ankle gave me problems going downhill those first 5.5 miles into Tesnatee Gap this morning—those miles seemed to take forever. I stopped for lunch on the exposed face of Cowrock Mountain, the only time the sun made an appearance—albeit a very brief one—before reaching the gap in a short downpour. But I felt little pain in the afternoon and the miles flew by quickly. 
Waldo/Bill the Pony caught up with me at lunch. We are both camping at the same site tonight. I best determine if he has a preferred trail name soon since our pace seems to be matching and he keeps making appearances in these entries. 
The wind is now howling and I’m typing as the nylon walls pulse and billow. So I guess this part is not all that fun. On the upside, I apparently have an internet connection. So there’s that.","Neels Gap

Last night was a first. I kept my gloves on all night and no elegant evening gown was to be found anywhere nearby. It was freaking cold. My bag was toasty, but any exposed bits became frosty. Like fingers and noses. 
I slept fairly well and was surprised to see light when I did wake up. The rain had stopped but the campsite was in a cloud and the tent was still wet. My fingers were numb by the time I had got everything all packed up. Not 10 minutes down the trail, however, I emerged from the cloud to find the sun out. Still, I hiked in the long sleeve wool shirt, my rain jacket and gloves. It stayed chilly until the trail descended into Unicoi Gap. 
The trail was again familiar and now I’m certain I previously hiked this section. There are cascading streams and the trail still followed an old road-like route for the first few miles. Unseen water gurgled under a trailside rock slide. Spring is still here—trilliums are in bloom and the leaves are still budding out at the higher elevations. I'm glad I'm hiking it now and now any earlier. 
Today brought both trail magic and trail gossip. A 2010 thru-hiker, his wife and both sets of parents were set up in Unicoi Gap. I learned of it only after eating my third flour tortilla with cheese and pepperoni. But 45 minutes later, I was still happy to accept what Will Farrell channeling the late Harry Caray would call a tall cool Budweiser. Actually two. And some fresh fruit. I should have taken a rice krispy bar for later, but I didn't want to be too selfish. Still. I was thinking about that treat for a long time after I had left. 
The overburdened woman I passed yesterday apparently arrived at a full shelter well after dark telling the occupants she was hypothermic, demanding to be allowed in and where was the bathroom. What I didn't report yesterday was that her first words to me as I passed her (around 11 a.m.) was that she needed to pee. The hiker who told me the story said that he had also passed her and she had made the same remark. We are now speculating that she doesn't want to pee in the woods. This could be interesting…especially in light of the fact that there are no outhouses along the trail throughout the Tennessee section. 
Another kid apparently is carrying all his food—as in for the whole distance, if that is even possible—because he has no money to buy anything along the way. The rumor is he also isn't carrying a stove or any cooking or eating utensils. 
See how news travels? 
I wanted to get farther today so my day is shorter hiking to the next hostel for laundry day tomorrow! But between not wanting to exit my sleeping bag this morning and the early afternoon trail magic, that did not happen. The forecasted rain began falling before reaching Tray Mountain which I could see looming ahead around 5 p.m. Decided to save that for first thing in the morning when I'm not so hungry and tired. Tonight is another repeat of last night, the big difference being that I didn't properly pitch the tent and the wind is hitting it broadside. Rain should stop around midnight and tomorrow’s weather prediction is purported to be sunny all day. I can live with that.","Poplar Stamp Gap

My trailside campsite had a nice coffee rock vista where a sunrise was entirely possible, but when I awoke at dawn, the wind was still howling and everything was icy. It had been another evening of glove donning. Decided to pack up and stop for breakfast and a water resupply at the shelter on the other side of Tray Mountain. Arrived before 8, but didn't leave until after 9. The folks staying there were quite social. So much for a head start getting to the hostel. I took my second fall soon after breakfast. The trail was still wet from last night's rain and I slipped going down some leaf strew rock steps. Nothing major--my pack bottom took the brunt of this one. Speaking of other falls, my ankle is still stiff in the morning, but not really bothering me. Am able to ice it again tonight at the hostel.
The day was sunny and beautiful and I ended my day around 3:30. Unfortunately the miles didn't end at the road—the hostel was another half mile down the road. But that's when I saw my first wildlife that wasn't rodent or feathered. I saw the black racer snake along the edge of the road assuming it was dead, but it was not. But it was quite sluggish as it's photo was taken.

So that was exciting. I talked to Sam this morning about 2.5 miles shy of the North Carolina border—and while that might have been considered exciting—only between us—it was what happened ten minutes after I hung up. Hiking with a dog is fairly common, so when I first saw the moving black object ahead on the trail, I thought Labrador. Then I quickly realized it was much too big. Cool! A bear! Which was almost immediately followed by something to the effect of “Oh, crap…there are cubs.” I made my presence known by yelling. A lot. Then I waited a bit to see if any other hiker's were catching up to me. When no one else appeared, I took out my phone—rapidly searching my playlist for someything louder than Joni Mitchell—and turned up the volume as high as it would go. This is generally considered poor form when hiking, keep yer dern music to yerself, but I felt the situation warranted special dispensation. I let that sucker play two songs and continued to announce my intentions such as “OKAY BEAR, I’M WALKING NOW. HERE I AM! WHERE ARE YOU BEARS???” Stuff like that. 
I didn't start out with the idea of hiking this far today, but it was a gorgeous day and the first 10 miles out of Georgia were really nice. Plus I was fueled by three bowls of cereal including a surprisingly tasty combination of Cheerios topped with Cocoa Puffs. Then I just kept adding more Cocoa Puffs instead of Cheerios. Then it was pretty much all Cocoa Puffs. 
And this is a test to see if either of my children are reading this blog. Cereal like Cocoa Puffs have always been forbidden in our household. But my goodness—were they ever delicious. Chocolate for breakfast! Who knew? Well they did, for starters…
Hit the state borders by noon and just kept going. North Carolina started out a bit beastly—an 800’ climb that was steep. Then the last few miles descending to a road were rocky—rocky as in Pennsylvania rocky. Erggg. A few bad flashbacks. Georgia has been so gentile. 
Tonight's shelter/campsite area is halfway up Standing Indian Mountain adjacent to a clear running creek. I was even able to soak my ankle and wash up a little tonight. And there is an awesome sunset happening right now over the mountains the trail passed today.

The hike today was terrific. Started off with a hike up to 5,498-foot high Standing Indian Mountain, a mountain as high as some of the peaks in New Hampshires’s White Mountains, but it didn't feel like it. For one thing there are switchbacks. For another, the trail is primarily composed of dirt instead of rocks. 
My measly single oatmeal packet breakfast didn't last long and I was grabbing for my first power bar by 8:15 when I reached the summit. The next 10 miles was pretty even—only a few baby bumps—tracing streams, running through arched canopies of rhododendrons and passing by trailside springs. Most of the trail since we've started hiking in North Carolina thus far has been burned over. There were massive fires all along the trail last year and I'm not sure if these are a year old or more recent. The bases of the trunks are charred, but ferns and other greenery dot the ashy forest floor. Dappled sunlight creates Rorschach patterns. 
I hiked the first 11.3 miles by 1 p.m., then took a one hour lunch break by Betty Creek, soaking my feet among the amber rocks and clear flowing water, then writing. 
The afternoon was more challenging—the sun was intense today and the final climb up to the Albert Mountain fire tower, while short, was 400-foot vertical ascent with stairs and boulder scrambling. Albert Mountain marks the first 100-mile mark on the AT from Springer Mountain.

Our little group took the $3 county shuttle back to our various trailheads—Bree, Mike and Harley headed back to Rock Gap, 3.5-miles up trail, and I expected to see them catch up to me—which they did—at the burnt Wayah Tower mid-afternoon. Waldo, three other hikers and I started at Winding Stair Gap around 9:30. All of us, plus some, made it to the same Cold Spring Shelter tonight. Three of us are tenting .1 mile away from the shelter where the rest of the group is staying. They have the water, but we have the view. 
The hike today seemed tougher, perhaps partly due to all the fat relaxing we did at the brewery. Or because we had a 4.6 mile continuous climb to 5014’ Siler Bald, immediately followed by another 4.3 mile climb to 5342’ Wayah Bald. These elevations again rival the Whites in New Hampshire. The afternoon was hot and the black flies seemed to be out and about.
The highlight of today was the stone Wayah Tower which is even emblazoned with a white AT rectangle (meaning its on the trail and we should go up it). An unintentional highlight was the recently burned fire tower and surrounding forest. Charred timbers showed that the tower formerly included a wooden roof and the informational vista signage was nothing but melted fiberglass. But boy did those white blazes glow on the blackened tree trunks.
Admittedly, I succumbed to a lot of Podcasts today. Rather than taking away from the experience of walking for hours—walking for hours up a seemingly endless mountain—I find instead that listening to Podcasts adds a layer to my experience. My favorite is The Moth. Around Mile 10 or so, I was listening to a story by musician Suzanne Vega. Hearing her story brought back memories of my first favorite song of hers “The Soldier and the Queen.” I used to listen to the song over and over and over again. Which shows just how committed I was to repeatedly playing it. It was on a cassette tape and in those days, if you wanted to replay a song, you had to physically rewind the tape, attempt to gauge just the right place to stop and hope it was the start of the song. Rewind. Stop. Forward. Stop. Rewind. Stop.
My, but we've come a long way making it so much easier to get those ear worms stuck in that never ending playlist in our heads. And that is one reason why I've been listening to Podcasts over music thus far.","Winding Stair Gap/Franklin, NC

Woke up in a cloud this morning, so no view after all. Because today is only a “short” 11-something mile day, I stayed in bed for a while, listening to the leaves drip and reading. Made a delicious tomato soup for breakfast and finally left camp well after 8. I was one of the last ones out. 
After 1.5 miles, I reached a blue-blazed side trail to Rocky Bald with a sign that included handwritten notes like “Don't pass up!” and “A-Team Approved!” It also promised breath taking views and now that the cloud had lifted and I was ready for second breakfast, I obliged. So that set me back a half an hour, but it was a nice break. 
I hiked alone most of the day today and took a second break to climb the Wesser Bald Observation Tower. The mountains stretched green in every direction. Most of the day was spent hiking through more burned forest areas. The AT is more of a brown/black tunnel than the green tunnel in this section. The understory is ashy and trees are charred. In places cavernous holes have been created where roots burned away. 
My third break was for lunch, perched on the edge of what was noted on the map as “The Jumpoff.” Here the trail left the ridge line and began its four mile descent to the NOC. 
Yesterday, I had a near miss swallowing a bug. Today, not so lucky. The thing flew into that back of my throat and I couldn't hork it out. It actually had flavor. Bitter. Like my feelings toward choking it down.
After that little incindent, I caught up with Rawhide, a retired grandfather of two from Massachusetts with whom I’ve been leapfrogging with the past few days, but didn't know his name. We were together when we saw the snakes, one on a mossy log guarding a low flowing spring and the other right on the trail a few hundred yards further. Even with all that excitement, it still seemed to take a long time to get here. But once I checked in at the General Store for my bunkhouse stay, I espied a frozen ice cream treat and immediately went to work on that. Made up for the bug. 
Since I’ve been writing, the predicted storms have arrived. Good call on the bunkhouse tonight. Now to just get over to the brewpub across the river in this mess!","Cold Spring Shelter

The climb out of the NOC is intimidating—or at least the map profile and other hiker blogs strongly suggests this. I decided that I would take my time and either hike to the first shelter seven miles away or the campsite ten miles away. So I took my time getting up, ready and then decided to join Robbie, the New Zealander who is hiking only halfway in four months and who decided to take a zero today, for breakfast at the restaurant. Then I headed over to the outfitter to print out my Smokies National Park permit, browse the clothes and gear I couldn't carry, noticed that they had copies of Boundary Waters and the Northern Forest Canoe Trail books (noting that I should get in touch with them post-hike about stocking my thru-paddler guidebook), and thus  it was not until 10:30 a.m. before I finally headed out. To be honest, I wasn't looking forward to that and I was really dragging. Plus that huge skillet heap of breakfast goodness consisting of two eggs, mushrooms, broccoli, tomatoes and cheese over a heaping pile of homefries, was now resting heavy in my stomach. 
It seemed to take hours to reach the first 2.5 mile mark, but once I got going it was a fine day for hiking. Decided to push on past the shelter and tackle another 5000’ summit at the end of the day to end up at this campsite village consisting of a dozen tents and hammocks. Tonight I'm with a completely different group of people. My little group wanted to push for a 16-mile day, something that wasn't in my wheelhouse for today. Unlike my group, most of this group of hikers seem to have trail names—something that hasn't happened to the unnamed people I've been hiking with the past week. Katie and Nicola are also from New Zealand and also lack trail names. I met them at our bunkhouse last night. 
This group has a fire going, one person had music playing (Grateful Dead, Stones, CCR—strange coming from a 20-something’s iPhone, but acceptable to my ears) and they are still arriving as I write at 8 p.m.
A fun highlight today was crossing paths with “Kremlin.” We had stopped to chat and I asked if we’d met before. When she told me her name we figured out we had indeed met once before—last year at the Lake of the Cloud AMC hut in the Whites of New Hampshire. She was back finishing a section she missed last year due to all the fall fires. 
A not-so-highlight was hearing that a hiker ahead of me had warned of a rattlesnake on the trail. Never saw it, but for a while every serpentine root made my heart jump a little. Ultimately no wildlife sightings beyond the usual birds, butterflies and furry woodland rodents.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

When my son was young, we went camping to a nearby Wisconsin state park with another friend of mine and her son. That trip was memorable for a number of reasons, but the biggest being the non-stop, all-night long Whippoorwill cacophony. I got to relive those memories last night. When the first twilight incantations began, I mentioned to a fellow hiker that this doesn't bode well. He replied that he loves hearing the sounds of nature. I left before he was up the next morning so I don’t know if he still loved nature equally as much, after what at least for me, was a sleepless night. That thing (or things) never let up—or so it seemed—during the dozen or more times I had been awoken. Not even ear plugs helped. Not even the grunts, snores and occasional farts of my camping neighbors could compete. Perhaps that fellow hiker fell into one of those latter categories and was in fact sleeping soundly. At some point I resorted to putting in my earbuds and let music play and finally got up for good at 5:45 to the sounds of George Harrison’s “Hear Comes The Sun” was playing. 
I was the first one on the trail living up to my trail name by breaking through the spider webs barricading the trail each morning.
Today is Mother's day. In the past, one of my favorite observances had been to go out for breakfast with another friend, leaving the kids behind with the dads. I mean really, most of us are with our families all the time anyway. So the real gift, at least to my way of thinking, is to get out mom of the house and away from everyone. Better yet, when she returns from her brunch—or weekend—the house has been completely cleaned. 
Today, I’m alone on another perfect day for hiking—pleased to have this opportunity to be out on my own and content that my family is well and doing their own things too. 
Well, that’s at least how the day started. 
I had booked a room at the Fontana Dam Lodge a few days earlier and would have been able to check in tonight—or even hike in the next morning for a short “nero” day, but the lure of both a shower at the “Hilton” shelter and knowing I could have a more relaxing full day at the lodge the next day was motivating. The topography hadn't looked too bad. And I assumed (correctly) that the little group I'd been keeping up with would be here tonight. 
The trail was pretty, the sky blue and the two piles of black bear poop, fresh. I also scooped a Luna Moth out from a water source, but most of its wings were already missing. I likely wasn't very helpful. But that bear poop was amazing! 
At 3 p.m. I passed the last shelter and official camping spot, 6.6 miles from Fontana Dam. I really didn't want to stop this early and rationalized that I could probably find a stealth site to stop at if I felt it was taking too long.
Well it did take longer than I thought 16 overall miles should take, but I didn't stop. I mean, there was a shower at the end of my day. Finally arrived at 6:45 p.m. Very hungry. Somewhat sore. Very sweaty. Happy Mother's day indeed.
And then there was the little math problem. I miscalculated. Turns out today was really 18.3 miles. I suppose I’m happy I hadn't realized it sooner or I almost guarantee that a shower wouldn't have been enough of a carrot to get me here tonight. Got to see Mike, Bree and Harley and say goodbye again before they headed to the Smokies early tomorrow morning while I take a zero, but missed Waldo, whose parents arrived to shuttle him back up to Damascus where he’ll resume his hike north to Maine.
Bree had some Tylenol PM which I accepted and finally had one of my best night’s sleep to date. Fell asleep in my tent listening to someone playing guitar at the shelter. A fine day after all.","Locust Gap Tentsite

What a nice place to take a zero. This actually feels like a vacation. Fontana Dam is situated in adjacent to the Smokies (where I'm headed tomorrow) and the Tail of the Dragon. I was told that there is a party of little Nissan sports car aficionados checking in here tonight. The Tail of the Dragon consists of 328 curves in 11 miles and this is a popular destination for sports cars and crotch rocket riders alike. 
A few years ago we inadvertently discovered the Tail of the Dragon while we were attempt to reach the Blue Ridge Parkway. Until I checked out the room directory, I hadn't realized I had been in this area before. So that’s cool. Following a single line using AWOL’s guidebook doesn't give you a sense of place. 
I was tickled to find conditioner on the bathroom counter next to the shampoo and the three bars of soap options. And—lotion?! Such bounty. While we did have towels, exactly two, plastic-mattress entombed Haven Budget Inn only had a single thin bar of soap, packets of shampoo and a paper bath mat. Maybe that is why the extra plastic protection is needed—there’s barely the amenities available to clean up. Or at least that is what I will choose to believe, but see what an extra thirty bucks gets you here? Even cheaper if I had shared the room, but after two weeks of sharing bunkhouses, shelters and campsites, I’m ready for a night alone.
The lodge/resort is very hiker-friendly. I was able to check in at 9 a.m., pick up my mail drop and call my mom for a belated mother's day talk—doing so before laundry while refraining myself from sitting upon the clean sun-bleached linens of the nap-seducing bed decked out with four pillows, none of which require inflating. 
But chores first before naps! I did laundry wearing nothing but my rain kilt and the one long sleeve sleeping shirt I only wore briefly (and thus it's still clean) since my last real laundry day back in Georgia. Let’s just say that this is not a good look. The nice thing about hostels is that they often provide loaner clothes so you aren't reduced to sitting in front of a laundry mostly in rain gear watching a guy polish his little yellow Nissan sports car across the parking lot.
However, I am grateful that there are few people around, and there was a little area in the corner, half behind the washing machines and out of view of the picture window where I was able to change out of everything I was wearing. I will soon become respectable once again. Not to mention clean. 
When I'm not this desperate for laundered clothes, but am visiting town, I will just walk into a shower at the place I'm staying with all my clothes on and using shampoo, stomp on them a bit in a classic wine-making style. This is enough to get by until I’m ready to do a full load using the more modern and thorough mechanical method, automation rendering the work of washer women obsolete. And by full load, I mean the clothes I’m wearing, my sleeping/dry change of clothes, one pair of extra socks and undies and maybe the sleeping bag liner. 
While waiting for the drying to be done, a few hikers I met and passed yesterday have wandered into the village and are staying here tonight as well. Made some loose plans for dinner. 
Laundry completed, I finished sorting my food (yeah! One pot taco dinner is back!), picked up a few bars at the General Store, sat on the bed icing my still slightly swollen ankle, wrote few postcards and am now ready for that nap.","Fontana Dam

Today was a roller coaster of energy levels. 
Woke up early, but had to wait for the restaurant to open at 8 a.m. Watched the sun hit the mountain tops where people I now know are camping. Once the restaurant was open, I joined a father and son who are hiking a section of the trail with very light gear and doing almost double the miles I do per day. Hello—and Goodbye. From the table we looked up at mountains we were going to tackle today. They seemed high, but it's sort of cool to know your body will be powering you up and then you'll be looking down. Just like those friends of mine are probably doing.
The 8:30 shuttle dropped me off at the Visitor Center at Fontana Dam, missing .3-miles of the trail, a sidewalk between the shelter and the visitor center. Only a single boat was fishing in the reservoir side in an otherwise vacant dam. I walked across alone, no cars passing and no sign of any other hikers. 
Sir Bob at Top of Georgia Hostel has told folks that the first day hiking into the Smokies ranked a number one in difficulty. The trail would be hard. We ascended 2100’ over 4.4 miles. But like the expectation of how great the movie “Bridges of Madison County” was suppose to be, neither lived up to the hype—at least for me. It was a long haul, but compared to parts of New Hampshire and Maine, this wasn't as difficult. 
What was difficult was the heat. 
I reached the first shelter, Mollie Ridge, at 3:30 and considered stopping there, but it was still early. But reaching that shelter took a lot of effort. I was soaked in sweat and had been guzzling water. I was so hot that I reached that point when I wasn't even hungry. But then I remembered the Heath bar I had packed in my side pocket. Stayed in the shade of the shelter for a half an hour, ate the Heath bar and another protein bar, then decided to walk another 2.8 miles to the next one, which is where I am staying tonight with a small group of known and unknown hikers. The last 2.8 miles were actually some of the best today. The trail was no longer in the sun and it was mostly downhill. A kinder, gentler trail. Or maybe it was the Heath bar. 
Arrived here before 5:30 and headed toward the small stream where a pretty good shower opportunity awaited with the aid of a water bottle, well away from everyone else. Nothing like a dump of cold spring water to wash away the sweltering feel of the trail. And dirt. And salt. And bug bites. The little buggers are starting to make an appearance.","Fontana Dam

With the exception of a little help from Tylenol PM a few nights ago, last night was my most restful night to date—and this in an area where every shelter warns of bear activity. 
The ancient stone shelters of the Smokies have dusty dirt floors, unused stone fireplaces, two platforms for sleeping up to six or seven people per deck and pieces of wind shredded plastic reinforced tarp hanging over the open side. At one time chain link fencing closed off this open side, but in these modern times, I guess plastic tarp is all that is needed? 
So one might think that sleeping in a space akin to a picnic pavilion, inhabited by mice, next to strangers, some of whom snore, would not make for a good night's sleep, but I slept great! My bag was cozy warm all night and the wind made for some good white noise. I was so dead tired at the end of today's hike that I also just about face planted into last night's ziplock bag of dinner, so that could have been a contributing factor. 
Was one of the first people up again, but I made coffee and decided to eat one of my heavier, bulkier dinners for breakfast. That’s another thing, my food bag seems to be ginormous. Yet another reason for such a drag-ass day yesterday.
The white noise stuck with us all day today, adding an air conditioning element to the sunshine. Maybe that's a reason this day didn't seem as exhausting as yesterday, although Flash, whom I’m camping with again tonight, thought both days were tough. Tonight he’s the one trying to stay awake through dinner. 
We have remained above 4300’ feet all day including a nice approach and vista at 5400’ on Rocky Top. Tomorrow is the highest point on the AT—Clingmans Dome—but we are hiking at more or less this same elevation. None of the dips down into gaps, or notches, just to go right back up. 
I ran into another 2016 thru-hiker heading south this afternoon. Samurai Blue started last year from Katahdin as a Southbound hiker in June, but came off the trail in October due to the fires and injuries. He passed his 2000 mile mark today on his quest, like me, to finish the entire trail over a two-year period. We very likely passed each other somewhere along the trail up north last year.
Only four of us at the shelter here tonight, elevation 5454 feet. I already know Flash snores. I was interested in hiking another 1.7 miles to the next shelter (in the Smokies, you have to stay in the plastic tarp-protected shelters), but everyone from last night's shelter, plus more were reported to be there. Two new people I haven't met before arrived after dinner. 
Speaking of dinner, bug number three flew into my mouth earlier today. This one lacked flavor.","Russell Field Shelter

Our protective plastic tarp was battered by wind all night and I repeatedly awoke to mice running on or near my head, so not the best night’s sleep. Was up with the birds and in the process of making breakfast when I noticed a pretty large bear eyeing Flash and I. High Loon had already left and our fourth companion was still in the shelter. We made some noise and it moved off. Toward the direction of the bear cables where food bags are hung. We were a bit in a quandary as our food bags were now sitting next to us. The bear did wander off, but with more of a “yeah, I see you, but you don't scare me” kind of attitude. 
So—Flash and I hiked out together, talking it up for a good mile or more. 
I liked today's geography. Sphagnum moss. Pine trees. Moss covered pine trees. Forests of sphagnum moss and moss covered pines trees. Oh and Clingmans Dome. Even though today marked the highest point on the trail it 1) wasn't nearly as challenging as summiting Mt. Katahdin, and 2) had none of the same summit feelings. You'd think we'd be feeling a bit more excited for this moment, but it was just another bump on the map. Also, there were bus loads of people who had driven up within half a mile of the tower. 
We had hiked through a cloud all morning and the view from Clingmans Dome was socked in as well. I'll just have to drive there next time becoming one of the bus loads, when the weather is better. 
The trail followed the road to Clingmans Dome for most of the day, except when it veered away to take us over two obviously “necessary” summits, emerging at Newfound Gap on busy US441. Unbeknown to the hundreds of people parked at the rest area on the north end of the trail, someone had left some trail magic on the south side: water and gatorade. I crossed the road and became a sweaty novelty while people posed by the Appalachian Trail sign and discussed how some people hike the whole way. Talked to a nice older couple about my trip, then with that Gatorade boost, powered my way up the trail the remaining three miles to tonight's very full shelter. A very fresh looking young couple arrived about the time everyone was heading to bed. 
Passed my 1500/200 mile mark today.
There is a herd of very tame deer hanging around the shelter, which may indicate no surprise bears at breakfast tomorrow.","Silers Bald Shelter

The shelter options today were either 12.6 or 20 miles. Rain was forecast to begin around 10 a.m. So a shorter day today. 
Woke up in a cloud again this morning. Everything is damp from my shirt to my backpack to the rubber handles on the trekking poles. After last night, the young couple probably thought they had wandered into a scene from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. They had probably envisioned some fun wilderness hike to a quaint strip one shelter and instead found themselves amidst twelve hikers who haven't washed up for at least three days and parked next to Flash who snores like a freight train. They left early in the morning. I noticed that she was dressed in a nice white virginal sweatshirt, her hair still looking and smelling pretty fresh. You notice these things. 
Today's hike stayed above 5000-feet all day, following ridges and hugging the sides of mountains. There were lots of views and I took lots of pictures that likely will all look the same to everyone back home. A challenge was that there was no water between the morning and evening shelter without going off trail a half mile. But it wasn't as hot, the elevation changes weren't as extreme and the rain held off until 12:30. When it did arrive, it was only intermittent showers. Until post-dinner. 
Arrived in camp before three to a somewhat full shelter. The two coaches, now named C1 and C2, were taking a break here before heading on another 8 miles to the next shelter, but five young men from Michigan stopped here for the day after their five mile hike. Had time to heat up water and use some Dr. Bronner’s soap to finally clean up a bit better than just ice cold water. Made tea, a first dinner and lounged around feeling like this was just a camping day. After 12.6 miles. Around dinner time, more hikers that I've been overlapping showed up after their day off in Gatlinburg. Made a second dinner and rain is now pelting the shelter’s metal roof as I write.","Icewater Shelter

The Tri-Corner Knob Shelter ended up not making for a relaxing night. One person arrived around 11 p.m. well after everyone was down. One or more left at 4 a.m. I slept on the top deck above Flash, whom I know slept all night because he never stopped snoring. I also had a queasy stomach, perhaps due to eating two dinners. Or not properly filtering water. I also woke up rolled over and in an angle fairly close to one of the young Michigan guys. So yeah. A rough night. 
The trail today was mostly downhill—which is not easy. Going up is actually easier—at least from a joint and muscle point of view. Also toes. Out of the 18.4 miles, more than ten of them were downhill—including a run of about seven miles. Parts of the trail were wet and squishy and boy did that ever feel good on the soles. While we expected rain again today, it never materialized.
My motivation ended up being the Standing Bear Hostel, where a shower awaited. This was especially motivational as the afternoon heat was sweltering. My hands were sweating so much that I even formed a small blister upon the palm of my right hand. 
The worst part was the last three miles—it was just getting long to be a long day. And did I mention the heat? At least the trail followed a pretty little brook that turned into a cascade. And then, trail magic! In the form of ice cold soda, water and/or beer! And chips. I don't believe I've ever drank a can of Pabst in four gulps like I did this afternoon. Delicious! Thanks Beer Angels!
The hostel property itself  is very cool—lots of stone work details, such as a bridge leading to the showers and privy. The shower stalls are constructed of cement and bottles like our cordwood sauna, the floors made of river stones. Bunks are built from wormwood tree trunks and there are reclaimed doors and tin sinks and fun details like that. I got me some more ideas and new plans for our cabin now! There is definitely a hippie vibe (including doing your laundry by hand using a washboard), but the staff seemed a bit zombie-ish and not in a hippie sort of way. They were mostly helpful, but no one seemed very happy. Maybe because they got stuck working this weekend during Trail Days which was being held in Damascus. 
But here is a mystery—what happened to my black wool long underwear? Sure they were riddled with holes and I was going to toss them at the end of this trip, but not quite yet. Because I'm wearing a hiking skirt, they are my only “pants.” Last time I remember wearing  them was in one of the shelters in the Smokies. I pulled them off in my sleeping bag. They are not to be found in the few possible places they I expect them to be—the clothes bag, the bottom of my sleeping bag, or loose (which would be odd) in my pack. Troubling. And poor form if I accidentally left them in a shelter.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Thanks to Flash self-deporting himself to a private room last night, I slept quite soundly. Third best sleep to date. 
Pretty much everyone at the hostel decided to take a zero today because the rain did arrive overnight. I'm meeting a friend tomorrow, so no zero for me. And I didn’t think the rain sounded all that bad—yes it would be all day, but it wasn't cold and stormy. Still, I took my time getting started and didn't leave the hostel until 9:30, then I made a few phone calls where the reception work best on the road by the trailhead. It wasn't until 10 a.m. with the rain now coming down that I finally got started. 
The first few miles were now all back uphill. I just plodded along. My umbrella kept me mostly dry. The only point where I was beginning to get chilled was crossing Snowbird Mountain, a grassy bald by an FAA tower. About halfway across, another round of trail magic—this one ice-cold soda and lemonade in a cooler near two chairs set up for one to enjoy the view. While the lemonade was thirst quenching, given the temperature, I can't say it was exactly refreshing. And the rain prevented any view viewing. 
Next up: Fun with a fallen tree. A large, multi-branched tree block the rain-slicked trail along a steep hill and it took quite the effort to work around it, of course without taking off the pack. My umbrella also makes feats like this interesting because the minute I bend over too far, water streams down my formerly protected back. In general the umbrella works out great, but I still don't remain completely dry. 
Stopped for lunch and a chance to get out of the rain at a shelter after 3.5 hours. And surprise! There were many familiar faces waiting out the rain. I think I had the better day hiking instead of sitting in a dark, cold shelter all day. Don't know about the folks who zeroed at Standing  Bear, though. At least they had books, an internet connection and a the opportunity to eat themselves silly with a full food resupply store. They certainly would be able to spend the day drinking, reading and staying warm(er) and dry(er).
My day ended at Max Patch—an area that had been clear cut for cattle and is maintained as a bald. I was intending to camp near the summit, which a lot of hikers look forward to doing on clear nights. However, I am unsure of the forecast which originally had scattered showers still predicted into tomorrow and don't care for the idea of becoming the highest object during a lightning storm. Opted to camp under some trees where the trail re-enters the woods. No neighborly snoring tonight. Instead I need to rest soundly amid woodland night noises. And a baying hound or two bellowing in the valley below.","Standing Bear Hostel

Last year I reported staying with a college friend who lives in North Adams, Massachusetts. Even though I never lived with her during our college years, being able to spend four days slack packing, having a bed to sleep in not to mention showers at the end of each day, was the bomb. It was like we were roommates in a really nice house. 
This year, my actual college roommate is here visiting from Wisconsin. We’d been calling, texting and messaging on Facebook in all manners of contact in an area where cell coverage was intermittent at best. 
The trick was where she’d eventually find me. The lines and notes in AWOL’s guidebook told me nothing overly helpful for a driver. But we worked it out. My final text got through and she was waiting for me at 4 p.m. at the Glarenflo Gap chatting it up with Bear Spray. 
The day started out in rain, but the trail was really nice for the first five miles after Max Patch. Kept leapfrogging with two hikers I previously had not met all day today. The hills were loaded with blackberry bushes and the last four miles descending from Bluff Mountain to the gap seemed very long. But then all the miles seem longer at the end of the day. 
Side note: My new favorite podcast is “The History Chicks.” Thus far I’ve learned about Lucille Ball, Frida Kahlo, Mary Queen of Scots, Lizzie Borden and Carrie Nation. The miles become slightly less long and the hills less steep when my mind is concentrating on historical details.
Kay brought me to the campground where she has her trailer set up in Hot Springs. We knoshed on a pound cake her neighbor had sent along (I alone, could have eaten the entire thing) and then Kay made me dinner while I got a shower. Like Becky in North Adams, I now have some loaner clothes to wear this week. I could get used to this very quickly.","Max Patch

Slept great last night despite an actual freight train rolling past the campground where Kay and I are staying. In a strange twist of logic, it was Kay who fell fast asleep by hiker midnight while I stayed up and wrote. 
Rain was in the forecast and the rain it did fall. For starters, I hadn't pushed my hiking shoes far enough under the trailer last night and one of them was positioned exactly tangent to a drip line, filling up with water. I never was 100% positive if my shoes were GoreTex, but judging how well the shoe held water, pretty sure they are. Fortunately for me, Kay and I share the same shoe size and she had a pair of Keen hiking shoes that I was able to field test for her today. Before the aforementioned size 10 boat load of water, my shoes had been wet for two days now and I had been developing some new and exciting blisters. Thus the opportunity to wear dry shoes was a win for me. Plus it gives her bragging rights to claim these shoes hiked a section of the Appalachian Trail. Fair deal. 
Without the weight of a fully loaded pack—in addition to dry shoes—I was able to knock off the 6.6 mile segment back to Hot Springs in under three hours, although by the time I arrived in town, Kay’s shoes were no longer dry. Arrived more or less in a downpour.
After a snack, headed over to the laundromat and finally got that year-long “I don't need to take my gym clothes home”middle school boy’s locker room smell washed out of my hiking clothes. Then Kay and I headed over to Hot Springs claim to fame, natural hot springs, where we soaked in a mineral spa tub for an hour outdoors, surrounded by a bamboo? (yes, bamboo) forest, overlooking the French Broad River, as the sky once again opened up and rained. The rain stopped before we left and wet cloud tendrils wafted between mountains as the sun re-emerged. Actually, it just emerged. We hadn't seen it all day. 
Post-soak, Kay whipped up some flatbread pizza roasted on a cast iron skillet for dinner, a test recipe in which I was the grateful guinea pig (it passed), while I organized my food drop and planned for the next few days. This currently quiet campground is booked through Memorial Day and we need to move on Thursday. The plan is for me to slack the next few days and Kay will secure a campsite up ahead through the weekend so I can milk, I mean we can continue, this hiking/dinner/sleeping in a camper thru-hike thing a bit longer.","Garenflo Gap

Kay dropped me off at Allen Gap and I slacked 14.4 miles back to Hot Springs, southbound. The French Broad River and tributaries are already rerunning high after the last few storms. Wispy clouds drifted skyward in the gaps. Soon I was walking through these same wafting tendrils—the landscape covered in a fifty percent tint of white—if this had been Photoshop. 
Ran into Spice Rack and Leila whom I had been overlapping with for the past two weeks, but I now know are a full day ahead of me. Also passed Skreech, about a half day ahead. The rest of the lot, of which there were many including about a dozen people zeroing at the Spring Mountain Shelter waiting for the predicted rain to come, are folks I've never seen before. So a bunch of different faces only a day ahead of me.
I hiked in partly sunny, but increasingly windy skies in the morning. Soon after passing the shelter I heard a crash and saw a small round black shape barreling away from me. Never saw Mama, which is just fine. That makes five bears in under three weeks thus far. 
The rain held off until 12:30-ish, then really came pummeling. Kay later told me there had been tornado warnings in Hot Springs and that the radar showed a red glow over the area I had been hiking. My umbrella kept me mostly dry and it really was more of matter of just walking through a downpour to dissipating sprinkles. Until the next wave hit. Hiked through that to a field that, according to the nice informational sign, had been a former tobacco farm but was now maintained as a turkey and grouse habitat area. The trail passed a little pond then followed a ridge line where I could see the French Broad River raging below before dropping back down to Hot Springs. 
Flash was now in town and Kay and I met him for dinner at the really nice Iron Horse Tavern and Inn. And score—live music to boot.","Hot Springs, North Carolina

The air was decidedly colder when we awoke this morning at the campground in Hot Springs.. But blue skies. At least for now. 
Kay is heading toward Erwin, TN to wrestle us a USFS campsite first thing this morning where we will now be based. The only immediate problem is that the next road crossing is 20.7 miles distant—a distance I’m not comfortable committing even for a slack packing day and especially knowing someone is waiting for me to show up. Too. Much. Pressure. So I will camp tonight and meet her 35 miles up trail, which is closer to the new campground anyway. Thus tonight finds me in rain, ensconced in a very cold shelter with five other hikers all huddled in their bags of down. One woman has yet to make an appearance since I arrived at 6:30. I have both of my long sleeve shirts and a t-shirt on, but not my puffy jacket, which I left behind with Kay—and will be sending home next week. This is a good test as it is freaking cold. I have been cold all day, but this shall pass.
The morning again started out sunny, although cold. I ran into the New Zealand women one more time as they were slacking south back to Hot Springs on this, their last day on the trail. 300 miles was enough and they have more places to visit during their visas.
Hiking in the cold was fine until the rain started. My fingers became numb and I had trouble adjusting the bungee cords around the umbrella handle, although I had one heat-inducing moment when two turkeys exploded into flight just a few yards in front of me. And if you know turkeys, that’s less than an aerodynamic feat. Almost as unexpected as seeing pigs fly. That'll make your heart pound for at least a few minutes.
I also stopped to boil a bit of broth and take a real break to warm up at a shelter 6.4 miles away from my final destination. 
This is the first day that I didn't have time to really study the map as I hiked and instead had a continuous string of podcasts playing for most of the day. I had a new “Wait! Wait! Don't Tell Me.” episode to hear (and in doing so caught up on some news), the Mother's Day Moth broadcast and several new History Chicks episodes. I learned about the real Alice of Alice in Wonderland, a two-part Marie Curie, and the last four wives of Henry the 8th.  Some where along the line, I blasted right through my 1600 mile mark today.
Between the podcasts and the cold, I just kept moving. The rain is taking a toll on people. One guy here in the shelter is talking about leaving the trail and has been pretty negative all night. Thus I write with earphones in place—a universal sign that I'm in my private zone within this communal space. 
Kay picked a good week to visit—at least as far as I'm concerned. Really looking forward to seeing her and her trailer complete with a mattress and firm roof lines, out of the rain.","Allen Gap

Last night was a first I'd rather not repeat again any time soon. Due to the cold, rain and tiny communal space, I never changed out of my hiking clothes last night. Made for a quicker morning, but ick. Gross. I mean, I've become accustomed to wearing the same clothes each day, but I've been at least able to slip into something less sweaty at night. Of course, I wasn't sweaty last night. And I guess the merino wool bra added a measure of insulation, but again. Ick. Gross.  
Ultimately I remained warm all night and at some point I realized the winds had died down. Morning dawned still cold, but the sky was blue and beheld an orb of yellow. You could see the light hitting the valley opposite and knew it would just be a matter of time before the fingers would once again be warm. Yesterday, the idea of sunshine was a distant memory. 
In spite of shorter mileage and despite better weather, this day felt longer. Yesterday’s romp through the clouds followed ridge lines with only slight changes in elevation. Today held more gap—thus lots of ups and downs. But at the end of my day, Kay was awaiting at Sam's Gap with the car—and a shower and change of clothes was only a short drive away. The only “wildlife” I noticed was a couple of free-range beef cows roaming the fields through which the trail momentarily crossed. 
Home is now Rock Creek National Forest Campground amidst RVs the size of last night's shelter and a seemingly high number of white SUVs. We are surrounded by families getting away from it all over the Memorial Day weekend. The air is filled with the smell of campfires, dogs are barking and clots of kids are hitting the asphalt on their banana bikes—or whatever it is kids ride these days. Across the road, someone is using a leaf blower, at least I think that's what the dad said in a drawl I have a hard time understanding, to blow up a mattress. Clearly it's no Therm-A-Rest NeoAir. Quiet time begins at 10 p.m. Almost hiker midnight. Good enough for me. 
Correction: Kay just returned from her walk and said the leaf blower is being used to get the fire to flame up.","Flint Mountain Shelter

Today went fast, was interesting and Kay performed a little trail magic at the end of the day.
At the top of the first peak, I stopped to upload four days worth of blog posts, thanks to the excellent coverage. Turns out there is some sort of nearby sub-division. I had been running into a suspiciously high number of non-hiker looking walkers and was confused about access because I thought the next road crossing was another dozen miles distant, where Kay is picking me up tonight. I finally asked an older couple, neither of whom were carrying water, and walking with two dogs. Yup, there was a road and a bunch of houses just over the ridge, all of which was clearly visible from atop Bald Mountain. 
Cindy Lou Who, last seen zeroing in Hot Springs with General Hendricks, caught up to me as we neared the summit. At the very top of the bald, there was a wedding in progress. We watched for a bit as it ended and it sure seemed like it might be a hiker wedding as it was held right by a white blazed post, but alas, we weren't asked to partake in any post-ceremony refreshments. Dark clouds were beginning to gather (the meteorological ones, not the anger kind). We headed on.
Before descending, I said goodbye to Cindy Lou who would be putting on more miles today and getting ahead of me. Then FaceTimed the family back home. 
The predicted rain never materialized and I caught up with some other hikers within the last two miles including, Thirteen, another woman from Wisconsin. About 20 yards shy of meeting up with Kay, I rolled my left ankle and thought it might be resprained. We'll see. 
Kay had brought strawberries from the farm stand she had visited today and made instant friends with several hikers—including a weekend section hiker that seemed a little too appreciative for having only been out one night thus far. He acted like he’d been through-hiking on rations for weeks or months vs. a day. Red flag. I think I speak for everyone when I say he was a little out there—not necessarily dangerous, more like someone who could fill a conversation with his own ludicrous narrative, his irrefutable banter; someone who can suck the air out of the room, and was quite possibly into conspiracy theories. For example, he casually mentioned how easy it would be for someone, anyone really, to advertise a hostel on the side of a van, then kidnap the unsuspecting hikers instead. Red flag. Then he mused about the benefits of leaving the leaves on the strawberries and proceeded to pop them whole in his mouth. Red flag. Yeah. Not camping by this guy. He should be off trail by the time Kay heads back home, plus—news can travel up and down the trail faster than a case of Novo Virus, so his reputation has likely already proceeded him.
I picked up another food drop at a hostel I thought I'd be staying at prior to Kay’s visit, that now isn't completed necessary, and saw Screech, who hiked there, and General Hendricks, who Cindy Lou said had stayed behind at another hostel down trail. Clearly something is afoot. I'm fine with people who decide to skip ahead, I just was very surprised to see him ahead of me.","Sam's Gap

I've neglected mention my morning slack packing routine this past week. We get up. I don my hiking uniform. Kay remains in her jams. I eat breakfast. We drink coffee, and then Kay takes her coffee mug and just like a mom who drops her kids off at school, she drives me to my starting point instructing me to play nice with the other hikers. 
I went for a longer distance today which ended 3.3 miles from our campground. Yesterday's ankle roll seems not to have been injurious. The morning was beautiful—a gradual gradient circumventing many cascades. Last night’s thunderstorm significantly increased the flow of the springs and streams. In one case, water was bubbling right out of the ground, right by the trail. 
As soon as it warms up and things finally dry out, I expect there could be a lot more snakes out and about. The only wildlife I noticed today (beside all the usual woodland critters), was a rabbit. This rates a special callout because 1) I haven’t seen any rabbits thus far and 2) It was less than a foot away before it finally decided to stop noshing on the trailside grasses and wander off. 
The second half of my day was decidedly more challenging. Rocks began appearing with more frequency within the trail that followed alongside a stream. Ick. It was humid. I was tired. It really wasn't until the last mile that the trail passed through pines and became more trail-like for my tastes. And finally, Mom, I mean Kay, was there awaiting my arrival.","Spivey Gap

Mom made me breakfast, then shuttled me up to Iron Mountain Gap where I started today's hike heading southbound back to Indian Grave Gap. “Do your best. Forget the rest” and with a toot of her horn, she’s gone.The morning was again cool and a chance of rain. I am really beginning to ponder the day when the local reptilian population emerges from days of cold waterlogged captivity. 
Another game I play is making x-number of miles or hitting a certain landmark first before succumbing to my earbuds. I waited until four miles, then listened to music today. What I haven't reported is that with Kay fetching me nightly—and having access to electricity, as well as having changed my data plan to unlimited prior to hitting the trail—I have been binge listening to the most recent episodes of Survivor, The Amazing Race, SNL and The Late Show streaming into my phone via an app. Truth be told, that's what really got me through yesterday's 19.5 miles. Today however, I showed restraint and only listened to music. For those of you interested in such things, the playlist including Bon Iver’s latest unpronounceable release, Moby, Horse Feathers, Beth Orton and Joni Mitchell. Unfortunately, there are no cellular bars to be found at the USFS campground, so while I'm traipsing off in wilderness, hiking ridge lines and summits and still able to catch up on the latest cultural phenomenon, Kay has been forced to either spend her time reading actual books or heading into Erwin filching the free WiFi from the parking lot of the closed library.
Today's highlight was 5180-foot high Unaka Mountain, its summit covered in a dense spruce forest. Unlike Rhododendrons which I equate with humidity and through which I hiked today, this felt like northern Maine. Verdant mosses, pine-needle paths, towering pines. The air clearer and scented. Loved it! Perhaps the positive effects of negative ions?
Heading south, I again ran into Cindy Lou Who, Hendricks and Screech and other hikers presumably heading north I have yet to meet.
After texting Kay that I was running late, I ended up arriving at the gap early. The afternoon was spent doing laundry then hitting a local café where we again were both challenged by the language barrier.","Indian Grave Gap

I had intended to stay at the Roan High Knob Shelter tonight after a 15-mile day. Rain Mountain is over 6,000 feet and the shelter is nestled within a spruce forest. Much of the afternoon felt like Maine, but I arrived a little after 4 to an empty enclosed building buzzing with flies and some senseless left behind garbage—and I couldn't locate the spring. Because I want to hit a hostel tomorrow, putting in more miles today means less tomorrow and am I ever glad I pushed on. Am spending the night atop a bald, still not unlike Maine—but with a view of the sun setting over the southern Appalachian mountain peaks. It's blustery but one of my best campsites to date. 
I woke up this morning with hair that Kay described as an 80s skateboarding look. Unlike last year, I didn't get my hair cut short. Like last year I have not packed a comb. Depending on the hotel, hostel or friend, I may or may not have access to conditioner, yet my hair has remained tangle-free. Wild yes. But snarly? Not yet. Interesting…perhaps hair care products are entirely over rated. 
Like yesterday, Kay shuttled me back up to Iron Mountain Gap sonI could resume my hike north. No wildlife sightings en route today except for the two scampering rabbits I saw late this afternoon descending Roan Mountain. And a bear paw print overlapping hiker shoe prints ascending Roan Mountain. Made noise for a while but didn't see any actual bear. 
Today was my first day in a week with a fully loaded pack. A little slow going and my dry shoes soon became drenched walking through a dewy meadow and past an ancient apple tree. I pondered if this had once been a carefully cleared and tended homestead. 
As a normal person (i.e. not a hiker), you can reach the summit of Roan Mountain by means of driving a 1.9 mile road. It took me more than three hours to hike 4.5 miles to the summit parking lot. Another place to revisit by car, to be sure. 
Filled up my water bottle and kept going. And going. When I saw the balds from the Carvers Gap parking lot I knew I had made the right decision. Another two miles and I ran into Screech already set up for the night on the third bald. Home! Made dinner and stayed up to watch the sun set. The only problem with is great site is lack of trees. I sent my Ursack critter-proof food bag home in place of a lighter food bag which is now sitting, unsecured, on a rock about 50 yards away from my tent. We'll see if I will be eating breakfast tomorrow morning or not.","Iron Mountain Gap

I woke up to see the sun rise over the opposite side of the tent. This definitely was the best campsite to date. Plus my food bag remained untouched. Win-win.
Most of today was spent traversing the Roan Highlands—a series of unforested “balds.” It was spectacular hiking. Blue skies, cool breezes. You could see the trail for miles. This reminded me very much of a grassy version of Maine’s Baldplate peaks without the rebar—New Hampshire without the rocks. And then the trail descended four miles down to US 19E and for a time, it very much reminded me of New Hampshire. Or Pennsylvania. Rocks. Roots. Rocks and roots. I was hellbent on getting to tonight's hostel early enough to get some writing done. 
I finally reached the rhododendron level. The air was warmer. I am so not a southern woman. 
Arrived at the hostel at 3 p.m. only to discover that a hiking group has booked all of the bunks and the B&B rooms are full as well. Option was to tent or take the tree house. The tree house has a queen size bed. I can work with that.","Grassy Bald Ridge

I didn't leave this hostel vortex until 11:30 this morning. After arriving at 3 p.m. yesterday, by the time I finally left, this was practically a zero day. Except I ended up hiking another twelve miles today. Twelve extremely different miles than yesterday. 
But let's start with breakfast. Awesomeness. Three egg dishes, two potatoes, a tureen of sausages, blueberry pancakes, biscuits and gravy, a “Krispy Crème” donut cake, puff pastries, and cookies. So yeah, I wasn't in too big of a hurry to leave. Plus I wanted to hang out in my treehouse room some more. Spent the morning writing and catching up on email, and planning out my next few days. I'm still carrying four dinners, thanks to my lack of will power when it came to eating that Teriyaki burger last night. Decided to make the potential two day trip to my next food drop 34 miles away into three days. 
The trail today was fantastic. Nary a stone to be trodden upon—unlike yesterday's descent. The trail was flat with far fewer elevation changes. My plan was to hike to the first shelter, only 8.8 miles away. I showed up around four, even after taking a blue blaze trail to see Jones Fall (more awesomeness). Well, that's too early to stop especially if this leaves me with 25+ miles to knock off over the next two days. I'm not tired, the day is fine, so I push on. I decide that I'll go another three miles to a height of land that the guidebook indicated has a view. Typically views attract a stealth camp or two. And I am happy to be moving up and out of the rhododendrons into piney woods. But when I arrive at said view around 5:45 p.m., there are no flattened out spaces. I recheck the guidebook and realize that an inexpensive hostel is purported to be only .2 miles west of the view following an unmarked trail. Hmmm…maybe? I definitely have to eat my food though, but what the heck. 
Ten dollars later, I'm ensconced in a bunkhouse and am freshly showered. However, the bunkhouse is the kind of place where I am first laying down my tent footprint over the mattress. The sleeping bag. Must. Not. Touch. It. Other than that, it is a lovely setting.
 I’m writing on a porch over looking a mowed lawn while frogs are croaking in an unseen pond and the owner of the hostel is pounding out songs like Rocket Man and Fire and Rain on his piano as the sun sets. This seems to have been a good call vs. a night alone in my tent. Only one other woman is here—a long distance section hiker finishing out another few hundred miles. We've been told there is a local bear and to keep our things inside. She hasn't seen a bear yet, so we're hoping for a showing. Fine by me since I'm not in a tent.","Mountain Harbour B&B and Hostel

Well today didn't go completely as originally imagined. Basically I hadn't planned on doing almost eighteen miles. 
Popsicle and I stayed up talking well past 10 p.m. last night while Scott, the hostel owner played on. Thinking I had less than fifteen miles to do today, I slept in a bit and didn't get going until just past 8:30 a.m. Passed three people early in the day, all section hikers, I had seen yesterday at the end of the day. 
One of the nice things about yesterday and most of today is that the trail skirts the mountains vs. going up and down every summit. Oftentimes you're looking ahead and just know that the trail is going to lead you over that next peak. But this section has been relatively summit-free. The guidebook map lines are straighter. The only exception was the single perky breast topography, a 3-mile climb after Laurel Falls. But I wasn't going to tackle that until first thing tomorrow en route to the next hostel stay. Or so I thought. 
Besides straight lines and only the basic information about what is immediately near those lines, like towns, everything appears to be more or less the same. I was therefore surprised, however, when I reached a parking lot where many cars were parked. Okay…there are other trail heads nearby. I started toward Laurel Falls and the next shelter, another .7 miles beyond. The trail followed a river, threaded through rocky cliffs, descended over many stone stairs, and then, then there was the massive 40’? 80’? falls—and a whole slew of people, many of whom were swimming in the pool below the falls. People with dogs, people who left behind water bottles and orange peels and the ever ubiquitous toilet paper (as if that goes away).  After only seeing a few people each day, this equated to culture shock. The trail toward the shelter was well-traveled. This didn't bode well—especially on a Friday night. 
Maybe my subconscious just didn't see the shelter sign, but before I realized it, I was another half mile down the trail. The next official campsite was another three miles away—all uphill. Well that would definitely weed out the day hikers. At 5:15, I began my last climb of the day. By 7 p.m. I was home for the night—and I got my wish, sort of. There was no one around. And I surpassed my 1700 mile mark by 17 miles today.
I was so tired, however, that I didn't write this post until the next day, sitting on the deck of my tiny house bunk house at the hostel. Although, with no one around, I did manage to rinse off the sweat with a little outdoor Nalgene bottle shower. 
A few miscellaneous notes and observations: - I'm still swearing by the effects of taking Glucosamine. I have yet to experience the same pain that developed last year. Knees are popping. Feet feel good, although sometimes I get a “Restless Leg” kind of reaction at night. Nothing hurts per se, but it's like I can't get them comfortable as I'm drifting off to sleep.- Haven't seen as many snakes as I expected after all the rain and cold temps, but I occasionally hit pockets of a musty scent and wonder if I'm smelling something reptilian. On the other hand, sometimes I wonder if I smelling dank fur. But I just keep clicking the trekking poles along.- I definitely do not care for Rhododendrons. Another reason I was receptive to adding a 3-mile climb was because it meant I would be camping amidst oaks or pines. The Laurel Fork Shelter and any of the campsites located along the river were all in the Rhododendrons—and thus damper. Like smells, I pick up on temperature changes. When you are descending into the gaps you can feel the difference—sometimes in little pockets, other times the shift is uniform.","Vango/Abby Memorial Hostel

Slept. Like. A. Log. Last night. Oh boy. Didn't matter that I was alone or in bear country. The Nalgene bottle shower probably helped as well. Slept in until 7 a.m. then took my time getting to the hostel at the bottom of the unnamed 3700-foot mountain, arriving around 10:30. After sustaining several days of decent mileages, that average is taking a hit today. But a nero or zero is a good thing.
Boots Off is a newer hostel and the three bunkhouses are free-standing “tiny houses” holding four beds each. Thus far, I have my house to myself. This is a good thing. I’m not too sure about the other two guests—one of whom is currently talking to himself in the outhouse nearby and the other is smoking like a smoldering campfire and playing Fox News over his phone in the Common Area. Not using headphones is at best, poor form; at worst, rude. Fox News Guy introduced himself as hiking the trail for the experience and not the miles. Apparently the only miles he put in yesterday were between the Hampton, Tenn. Microtel Inn and this hostel, four miles by car—which is how I’m guessing he arrived here. After the third cigarette, I moved back to the porch of my bunkhouse. And our other current guest just walked by me back to his bunkhouse, still muttering. Am hoping other hikers to show up tonight otherwise the nightly bonfire could be pretty insufferable. 
Plus I'm missing our family friend’s, Claire, wedding today back home. My friend Beckie, her daughter Claire, my daughter Kacia and I used to go on annual canoe trips beginning when the girls were in middle school through high school. So there’s that. At least Kacia will get her Dad out on the dance floor tonight.
I met two other local Tennessee men heading down this morning while I had stopped to download more History Chicks podcasts. We got to talking and they told me about a new one, Lovett or Leave It. I listened to one episode before reaching the hostel and now wish I would have caught up to them to let them know this podcast is a keeper. Meeting them restored a little confidence after the littering Laurel Falls crowds and the two yahoos here at the hostel. I should mention that the hostel owners are nice—one of whom is from Wisconsin. Just sayin’.","Pond Flat Campsite

Apparently the theme this week is change. Popsicle, the woman I met a night earlier at the Vango/Abby Hostel, arrived at breakfast saying she was slacking back to this hostel tonight. Hmmmmm….Slack packing….the mileage could be longer today, the chance of getting to Damascus sooner and there is rain predicted for tonight. I’m in! 
Got a later than desired shuttle up to TN 91 and headed southward bound, returning to the hostel for a second night. Unlike last night, this place is packed tonight. There are a few familiar faces, but I don't have the little house all to myself. At least the four of us in it are all women and the two jackasses from yesterday have left. 
I learned from Jackass #1 that he thinks some people deliberately try to snore loud. He doesn't trust anyone, so as all his items marked so no one accidentally takes his stuff (aka steals.) He won't walk in the rain because” he doesn't have to” and he has opinions about his great gear. Jackass #2 (picture Gary Busey) was seen heading south and was also recognized by his muttering ways—actually one of the hikers here reported he was yelling at himself. No complaints about this lot.
The trail was fairly kind, mostly following ridge lines. The best part, for me, was the last five miles over Watuga Dam and around Watuga Lake. Great scenery. This is the area closed to all but hiking through due to high bear activity. Popsicle has yet to see a bear on this trip, and as it turned out, still a bust despite all the warning signs. One of the AT shelters has been closed since 2015 due to bear nuisances.
Thundered threatened around noonish, but the rain held off until late afternoon—and even then, it was more of a shower. Thunder did boom overhead at one point. Arrived around 7 pm and wolfed down a chowder before showering. One guy bought s’more makings and made a campfire and I ended up staying up past 10:30 mostly telling bear stories.","Boots Off Hostel

More hikers at dinner (no others passed today along the trail)Wildlife: A turkey and several poults, grouse
Another interesting day—as it turns out. The shuttle got Popsicle and I back to TN 91 an hour earlier than yesterday and I continued north with my full pack. I would either stop a few miles shy of Damascus or attempt to reach it. A local scout troop was also staying at the hostel and one of the adults suggested that today's mileage was actually easier than yesterday's. We'll see. I was still rather tired. 
Grade School, a young woman from Illinois, caught up to me mid-morning and we leap frogged each other throughout the day, most of which was spent hiking in a cloud. I never saw anyone else all day, after seeing so many people yesterday. I think I'm in between bubbles. Last night, while making s'mores, I had a nice conversation with Bushmaster. He showed me a homemade fun music video of the Roan Mountain Shelter he had taken of all the people staying there that night—and there were a lot. As you may recall, there was no one present when I had stopped there around 4:15 p.m.about five days earlier, and had instead left to camp atop one of the balds. And then at last night’s hostel, there were close to 20 people whereas the night before there were only five. So yeah, the trail is full of clots of people, I just seem to be in between most.
Anyway, I was walking in and out of intermittent rain showers all day. Until late afternoon. At 2-ish, I had again caught up with Grade School and we started discussing how reaching Damascus now seemed possible. And where were you planning on staying, etc. Long story short, it started pouring about the time we reached the Tennessee-Virginia state line and we booked the last 3.5 miles into Damascus, Virginia, having a great time splashing through the river of water flowing through what was once a trail. Well it was fun, theoretically, assuming we'd have a bunk tonight. Until we reached town. Once we hit Damascus, my wet phone stopped properly working. When it finally reach the first hostel, we discovered only one king room was available. Thus tonight I’m sharing a bed with a woman I only just  met today, who is around the same age as my kids. We both know that this king bed, very comfortable I might add, is far more spacious than if we were sleeping next to each other in a shelter. So its all good. I'm constantly amazed p, however, how easy it is to live close to perfect strangers on a regular basis. 
I have one dinner left and am picking up a food drop, but of course we headed out to dinner at a nearby restaurant. My husband will be mortified to know I selected a local IPA. After the last two big days and people taking zeros in Damascus, I've caught up to some familiar faces. 
The astute reader might have noticed that I mentioned crossing the Virginia border. I'm back in the last state. Damascus is mile marker 469.3. I had 865 miles to finish this year. This means that I now have under 400 miles left—and they are all in Virginia. I am now more than halfway done with the half I had left to finish and am in the home stretch.","TN 91

At 4 a.m., our room smoke alarm went off. Low battery. Took me a while to figure out how to get the batteries out. Other than that, Grade School and I slept very well on the edges of our King-sized bed. Joined a few hikers for breakfast at MoJos, then I headed off to pick up my food drop. Mellow had told us he had rented a bike and did a 17-mile shuttled trip on the Virginia Creeper Trail. This Rail-to-Trail bike path is 34 miles long, but local companies will shuttle you to WhiteTop, the highest point on the trail and from there you pretty much can coast downhill all the way back to Damascus. The Creeper Trail also parallels and intersects the AT for the first ten or so miles. Several people suggested that it is a more beautiful hike than the same distance covered by the AT. 
Grade School and I got our town chores done and then went for the bike ride/replacement hike. At least that is what I am doing. Grade School is returning to the trail from our Inn’s doorstep tomorrow whereas I will get shuttled about ten miles ahead where the AT leaves the Creeper Trail. Basically, I’m not counting today as a zero. 
So the bike ride. Fantastic! It was a wonderful sunny day today. The bike trail follows the Laurel Stream (or River?) and passes over it by means of more than a dozen trestle bridges. It was historic (there are several train station-like preserved buildings). It was summery, (we passed a guy cutting his lawn.) And it was easy on the feet. We covered 17 miles in just over two hours. We talked a lot. I learn I am exactly twice her age and that one of her favorite movies is “The Point.” Agree. Awesome. 
Afterward, we used the bikes to hit the grocery store located a mile away from the down town area, then stopped for an after biking margarita (the restaurant was closed on Mondays or that's where we had been planning to hit last night), and then returned to the hostel/inn where I ate one of my extra dinners. 
A few new faces here tonight and our room was reserved, so we have now moved to an adjacent room with twin beds.","Damascus/Hiker Inn

Wow is it ever easy to get used to a bed. The idea of camping out for the next few nights seems surreal, but here we are. At least today wasn't hot and sweaty. In some ways, the feeling is akin to our weekends spent at our cabin. Some Fridays, I'm scrambling to get work done and the thought of a weekend spent elsewhere isn't relatable to the present situation. Then we get there and I don't even think about the stuff I've left behind at home. 
I bid adieu to Grade School, who I mistakenly reported yesterday was half my age. I screwed the math up—which shouldn't surprise anyone who knows me. I'm double her age plus ten. Whoops. Headed to the outfitter for my 9 a.m. shuttle. I weighed my pack on their scale and with one liter of water and four days worth of food, it came in at 29 pounds—and that includes an avocado and some cheese.
Resumed hiking north around 10 a.m. I also erred regarding the number of trestles the Creeper Trail has—my starting point was at number 38—and they descend from there back to Damascus. And my starting point wasn't even at the halfway mark. 
Unlike the last time we last saw the trail, the trail is now dry. I follow it through more rhododendrons, that Grade School told me are actually an invasive specie. She has worked on an Americorps trail crew prior coming on the AT.. When we were coming into Damascus during the rain storm, she’d be kicking open drainage ditching plugged by debris along the trail. I only knock smallish branches out of the trail with my trekking poles when I can. 
I spent most of the morning climbing what appeared to be a very pointless mountain, Whitetop Mountain. Seemed to take forever to hike three miles up. But at the top—blooming azaleas, a view, rocky outcrops. I blissed out eating my cheese and avocado while listening to a Studs Terkel interview on a StoryCorps podcast that I had downloaded while in Damascus. 
A fellow Trek Blogger, who I’ve never met except through Facebook, recently posted an update that explains how the trail has a way of stripping away all of your defenses, leaving you emotionally raw and vulnerable. George (Old Growth) is around my age with similar life experiences—his spouse is back home and his daughter is expecting their second grandchild which is cutting his hike short this year. (Note to family: This is not a criticism, just an observation.) You can read his entire post https://thetrek.co/appalachian... but the gist is how things you might be listening to become internalized while you are spending hours alone with your thoughts. Today I let about a dozen StoryCorps podcasts stream and felt my chest tightening when an interview with the recently departed David Letterman’s mom was broadcast. I remember her Olympic reports and I have her cookbook. Other stories were beginning to turn me into a puddle. In George’s case, it was a Harry Potter book that made him weep.
In places the trail was a bit challenging—not just that blasted mountain, but the appearance of roots and rocks. Still there were moments like when I emerged on the other side of the mountain and saw the open vista of Elk Garden. No elk, but a few cows through which the trail threaded. 
Our shelter tonight is on the cusp of the Grayson Highlands (wild ponies!) with gorgeous views and there is a roaming, firepit scouring bull right out the front door. The two older guys from Roanoke attempted to shoo it away while I’m up here in the loft writing. “Git out of ‘er ya bovine!”
So. The asterisk. I met Retainer LAST year. I mention him twice in 2016—our first meeting was at the Ensign Coswald Shelter just into Maryland, memorable for two reasons: first—it was the “Shelter of Misfits,” a crazy cast of characters holed up for one night and second—the privy ranks right up there as one of the two fullest I've ever had the displeasure to use. Last year Retainer was heading south on a complicated flipflop while I was heading north. Months later he's back in Andover, Maine where our paths once again cross—again just for one night. Now here he is in the middle of the woods in Virginia. Karma? Divine intervention? Planetary alignment? Coincidence?
As is so often the case, you find yourself rehashing moments of your life as you walk for hours and hours. You think about family, friends and careers. You might think about conversations you’d have handled differently, things you want to argue about; projects to work on once this hike is over. You think about movies you want to see, music you should hear—and oftentimes, just what the heck you are doing out here. 
Apparently Retainer had been ruminating about work and through a string of thoughts, it lead to a connection about me. Turns out he worked for years with a person who was instrumental in founding the Northern Forest Canoe Trail and, after finishing his thru-hike, had discovered that I was also associated with the organization. And then here I was. I bet we chatted for a good half hour. Retainer was out for a training hike in preparation for the John Muir Trail. Like Kremlin, another odd chance encounter on a linear line in the middle of nowhere. Goosebumps.","Virginia Creeper Trail

Today was all about the ponies. And a couple of insufferable characters. And a bear story. 
But first, let's talk shelter life. 
Lightweight sleeping pads, like my Thermorest NeoAir, make crinkly noises when you roll over. All five of us had them last night. When one person rolled over, with the inevitable crunchiness, we all seemed to take advantage of the noise and would turn at the same time. And there was lots of turning last night—it was really cold. 
And ponies! The area around and through Grayson Highlands State Park has small herds of wild ponies. The adults approach you looking for food and when it is hotter, they lick the salt off your legs. The older colts came right up to me too. Like Roan Highlands, Grayson is also a series of open balds—so the scenery is a nice change from the usual trail terrain.
I also found fresh carrots on the trail today. Four were in a stream, but one was on the trail itself. I picked that one off, brushed off the dirt, wet it down a little—and ate it. I bet i'd never do that in “real life.” I couldn't figure out why they were there and then I remembered the ponies. Someone must have brought them in to feed them. Oh well. I appreciated the unexpected snack.
Another small group at the shelter tonight. I had stopped at Wise Shelter for a break late this morning where a night hiker was still hanging around. Three other section hikers who had tented at last night’s shelter stopped there at the same time. We had met the night hiker the night before as he was heading out after dinner, advising these same hikers that you really don't need to hang your food. Now he’s telling us how a bear had visited the Wise Shelter more than a dozen times last night and it nabbed a low hanging food bag. Good advice buddy.
And now this same advice-giving, late starter just arrived at tonight's shelter for a dinner break before heading on. But fun fact: he is now being treated to a narrative by one of my shelter mates. Picture a shorter version of Napoleon Dynamite. Napoleon is unpacking a lot—and I’m not talking gear. Since I arrived two hours ago. He. Has. Not. Stopped. Talking. He’s loud. He’s made phone calls. So far the stream of consciousness has included basketball stats, hiking techniques, people he’s pissed off, food drops, hostels, mileages, music, an arrest, naked hiking day (not associated with the arrest), taking a raft for ten days instead of hiking Shenandoah, a (not-at-all) “funny” story about taking oatmeal packets from a hotel in which he did not stay because the owners wouldn't let his friend use the restroom, his salt needs, his stove, his tent, can I smoke?, and the best statement; “As I have grown older, I now appreciate the awesomeness of Strawberry Poptarts.” Basically he’s “that guy.” One a crazy cast of characters just like anywhere else. I am both bemused and massively irritated.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Lived up to my trail name this morning—was on the trail breaking through the spider webs by 7:10 a.m. Funny how fast I can pack up when a shelter mate is insufferable. Napoleon was again talking from the minute he awoke—and before he was even out of his sleeping bag. He’s providing lots of material. I've concluded he's either really insecure or bonker balls.
I decided to do at least 18 miles today and then I was on a roll and just kept going. I also want to have a shorter day tomorrow when I pick up my next food drop. Also I'll be in a hotel for shower day. 
Saw bear #6 mid-morning. Actually it saw me first and bolted before I even knew it was near.    The trail was pretty fast. Except when there were rocks. And roots. At the end of the day, I was hiking over the vertebrae bumps of a mountainous backbone.
After stopping at the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center at 4 p.m. and grabbing a Dr. Pepper, which I did not know contained caffeine, I hiked another two and a half miles on and started looking for a campsite along the backbone. Two women at the visitor center told me tonight was a full moon—the Strawberry Moon. I wanted to camp on a ridge and started looking around 6 p.m. F inally found a site without too many rocks. Not an official site, so it looked like I'd be alone. But about 20 minutes later Cindy Lou Who rolled in. Nice. Then General Hendricks arrived and made a campfire. I've been leapfrogging them since Georgia. Stayed up to watch the moon rise and even saw stars come out. The caffeine was working it's magic. Also there are giant millipedes milling about our feet. Like a lot of them. 
General Hendricks shared this quote tonight by Albert Einstein: “There are only two ways to live life, as though nothing is a miracle, or as though everything is.”

Virginia is thus far looking a whole lot like northern Pennsylvania. Was walking over a bunch of rock crap and not at all pleased. Caught up to Cindy and Hendricks and two other hikers, Giggles and Treehouse, at an old school house where a local Methodist church distributes trail magic in the form of cold soda for humans and dog biscuits for companion animals. Giggles prefers to night hike and she walked until 2 a.m. last night under the full moon. 
Another mile and a half brought us into town where I have a food drop waiting at this Interstate-adjacent motel that has definitely seen better times and seems to attract truckers in addition to hikers. But my clothes are now washed, I’m clean and I even took a nap. Even though it's not a wasted day, it feels like one because I haven't moved from this room since lunch—which by the way was one of the most awesome $13.99 meals I've ever had. My something-del mar arrived in half of a fresh, grilled pineapple. It was fantastic. Four of us plunged through three baskets of chips as well. This is one reason I probably felt like taking a nap. Four days worth of food now packed and trying to figure out how to hike the next few days. There isn't much in terms of sights or towns and I sure hope there won't be the rocks to deal with or this is going to be a very long four days.","Stealth Campsite

I didn't exactly very well at last night’s less-than-choice accommodations. Probably due to the nap, I ended up watching most of The Hangover on TV last night and then couldn't sleep. Was back on the trail walking through fields of shoe-soaking morning dew. I noticed that the higher elevations had lichens and blueberry bushes. 
Today's hike had elevation changes, nubbins on the map, but was relatively flat. It was a relief not to walk on rocks today. That is one reason I ended up going as far today as I did. Another reason is that there is not much over the next few days—no Grayson Highlands—so no reason to linger. Still not experiencing any of last year’s knee or foot pain. Thanks glucosamine!
Saw bear #7 today as it bolted across the trail in front of me, only two minutes after I had passed a shelter with half a dozen campers still packing up.
Very tired tonight. That is all.","Relax Inn, Atkins, VA

I slept great last night. Also took a benadryl because the gnats and mosquitoes were pretty active the last few miles, and while I was setting up the tent my ankles and ear became irresistible. The view at this shelter was killer. I'm glad I pushed on. There are so little views during most hours of the day. We had a fantastic sunset that I didn’t have the energy to take a picture of last night and apparently a equally great sunrise that I didn't check out. Slept in until 7 a.m. Over our individual breakfasts, there was talk of a new hostel 15.8 miles ahead that wasn't in my 2015 guidebook. Interesting. Most of us who had camped together were also interested in this option. I might want to do this. It was hot yesterday, but even hotter today. 
Stopped at a shelter at mile 10.5 to get water and eat lunch and caught up with Cindy Lou, who had just met a Scottish couple offering a  ride into town to the hostel, another 5 miles-plus up trail. So she would head ahead of the rest of us, if we weren't able to call ahead. There were now at least three, maybe five people behind me who decided by now that yes, this hostel indeed sounded like a good idea. Now the problem was that no one had been able to make a call. Cell coverage was sketchy to non-existent. 
At 4 p.m. I hit the gravel road, one of five pick-up points—assuming the hostel knew to pick us up—and no Cindy Lou Who. No cell service. Period. About 45 minutes later General Hendricks arrives with another hiker not from last night. Then Wild Spirit/Thing (I still don't know her name for certain.) Then Lee. Then Tobacco and Ali. We weren't sure we we going to a hostel or not. Only three cars passed by in the hour and a half I spent by the bridge. Worse case scenario—there was a stream-side campsite. I was okay either way. But Cindy Lou Who? Was she sending a shuttle? Did she make it? 
At 5:30, a big white truck arrived—with Cindy Lou and the hostel owner. She was just as afraid no one was going to be there waiting. Now six of us were heading to the hostel which ended up being a half hour away. This hostel is a ranch house. The owner just opened this year and it is, um, a work in progress. Also, he is into metal rock. Not in the house, but in the truck and by the firepit. Still—it doesn't take much to make me happy when there is a shower. We stopped at a grocery store en route and I was able to pick up the cold beer I had been fantasizing about all day. This is i part  due to the audio book I've been listening to the past two days—Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle.” There is way more in that book beside food safety and midwifery, which is what I remembered from high school. Also, the protagonist was visiting saloons and drinking beer in today's installments—so that got me thinking. I did purchase fruit and yogurt for breakfast tomorrow.
Tomorrow the plan is to slack 20 miles. The trail has again been comparatively good, albeit hot and viewless.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Well the mileage today seems super impressive, but there’s an asterisk—the first 21 miles was slackpacking—meaning that only a daypack with water, lunch, rain gear and emergency stuff was carried. And the trail was smooth—meaning fast. My typical pace with a fully loaded pack averages around two miles per hour. This morning I knocked off the first seven miles averaging 3.75 miles per hour, a pace I didn't sustain, but still. Faster! The hostel owner met me at 4 p.m. and I hiked another 7 miles to this campsite near a small waterfall. I wanted to get further today to set me up for my stay tomorrow at the Wood Hole Hostel—a hostel I have been looking forward to staying at in Virginia. It's a sustainable farm, with community dinners—I imagine like the Bearded Woods Hostel I stayed at in Connecticut last year. But that's tomorrow's update. 
Five of us left together to slack this morning. Cindy Lou and Hendricks had their packs dropped off an hour before I did, and I didn't see the other two hikers after the first seven miles. At least one of them had talked about going back to the hostel for a second night. 
Anyway—today was a bit of a blur. I was in the zone. I hiked over mostly unnamed nubbins and listens to podcasts to pass the time. The biggest excitement, which really did make an otherwise unremarkable section of woods interesting, was the afternoon thunderstorms. The thunder began quietly as the clouds cloaked the sky, then became more insistent. Finally, the thunder was overhead and the rain began to fall. I had been leapfrogging another hiker and was quite a bit ahead of him when a flash of lightning immediately followed by a crash boomed nearby. A good time to hunker down and eat my lunch. I sat on a log with my umbrella and rain kilt, under the imagined protection of rhododendrons waiting for the thunder to move out. While I was sitting there, the hiker again passed me, happy to be soaked after the morning humidity. Three other hikers passed me going southbound, and I headed onward. 
A second shower with less thunder hit later in the afternoon, then cleared up by the time I picked up my full pack again. 
I finished up my snacks and was debating about whether to even make dinner tonight since I had been hiking late. Took the .3 mile blue blazed side trail to this waterfall area, got the tent set up, took my usual after hike sponge bath and went to boil water for dinner only to realize my fuel canister was empty. Decision made. Dinner was a bit creative, but fine. Especially the chocolate. The hostel offers resupplies, so I should be able to pick up a new canister tomorrow. 
A couple of number call outs: 28.1 miles is definitely a new high number for me. And again—without any of last year's pain. Even my feet are less messed up. I still have all of my toenails (lost three last year), and blisters have been practically nonexistent. Passed the 600 mile mark on this leg of the trip and…almost passed my 1900 cumulative mile mark. That will happen first thing tomorrow.
I'm not nearly as tired as my 23-plus mile day two days ago, but the bugs are much to attracted to the light of this ipad, so time to turn in.","Laurel Creek, VA

I tested out using my emergency piece of Esbit fuel to heat water this morning and thus was able to have coffee and hot oatmeal sitting by the banks of the Dismal Waterfall. Headed back to the trail. .3 miles is always so much faster and shorter in the morning than it is at the end of the day. 
The day was clammy and so humid even the rocks were sweating. I felt like it took a long time to get to the hostel. Not sure if my mental state was due to fatigue from yesterday's mileage or the heat or the fact that every time I look forward to a shorter day it always seems longer. Still I arrived at this fabulous oasis of a hostel around 3 p.m. as thunder started. 
Took a shower, got my clothes laundered, had the first of two smoothies and did some writing. Around 8 p.m. last night a big thunderstorm did roll through. It was nice to hear the rain hit the metal roof just outside my bedroom window. Lee reported that Cindy Lou Who and Hendricks were camping out tonight instead of staying here.

Another hot, humid day today. Knocked off another chunk of ridge line, which held some views, between Pearisburg, Virginia and the hostel. 
Pearisburg includes passing by a large plant, a railroad, an interstate and a landfill. Nothing very wilderness-like in that. A highlight of slackpacking southbound is again running past people who are ahead of you. I expected to see Cindy Lou Who and Hendricks (who did indeed get soaked last night), but was surprised and happy to see Grade School again. I'll be ahead by five miles tomorrow, but should see her again soon.
More scattered showers and thunderstorms in true form this afternoon. The first cloudburst was interrupted by sunshine. There had to be a rainbow, but the rhododendrons hid the sky. Two more bursts passed and I probably spent more time attempting to get the umbrella perched just right than hiking for a time. Arrived back at the hostel during a lull and got dried out before more storms rolled through, knocking out the power. I am writing in the dark by the glow of my ipad and headlamp. Just like camping!

Today was just another day at the office. Got shuttled back to VA 641 and walked all day. The first 12 miles followed smooth ridge lines, but I made a mistake—sort of—not stopping at the last shelter after 18 miles. The trail was nothing but rocks. Wasn't quite able to make my goal of 22 miles to a campsite purported to have a view. Finally found a flat piece of ground where someone must have camped last night because the ferns laid down for cushion are still fresh. 
Besides the shelters being mouse-ridden, people are really smelling bad after a few days of rain. Nothing is able to completely dry out even though the rain has fallen only in the afternoon for a few hours. My shoes have been soaked and today I got a few blisters where none had been present previously.
I stopped at 3:30 at the mile 14 shelter to wait out a thunderstorm and rest and wound up taking a little catnap while four others were talking (and smoking). I continue to be surprised by the number of people who smoke out here. I had no problem curling up on a wooden platform of questionable cleanliness. One guy attempted to scare me by shining his flashlight on an admittedly p, extremely large spider. But it was no where near me, so no worries. Decided to make dinner there before continuing on in what turned out to be another six miles. 
I really feel like I’m just putting in the miles on days like today and I am now driven to be done by the end of June. After yesterday, to do that, I need to average 15 miles/day. In sections like this—which are long walks along ridge lines—I might as well hike as long as I can. The rocks, though, in these last few miles, were maddening. 
Also—I fell this morning, number three on this leg. Slipped on a slick rock—so I don't go very fast with these conditions. The fall wasn't at all serious—I landed on the pack in some ferns. But this humidity and rain makes the rocks even more challenging. 
As I'm writing here in the dark, I just heard a hiker pass by. I don't know how night hikers do it! Plus—how do they sleep at night without (presumably) hanging their food?!","VA 641

Turns out another half dozen people passed by my tent in the dark last night. Autumn Leaf and Wombat would have stayed here too, if there had been room. They told me that Grade School had just passed me, so that was the first person I heard. 
Awoke once to softly falling rain and made sure everything was batten down. Otherwise I slept like the rocks that are surrounding me. Caught up to Grade School at the Wind Rocks view and campsite, my original goal. 
I might not have done 20 miles yesterday after all. It took a while to get to the view, which theoretically should have been only 2.5 miles or about an hour away. Took a half hour longer, but of course, there was still an obstacle course of rocks to still hike over first. I surprised a deer that snorted at me. Or maybe, it too, was miffed about the rocks. 
The hot spots on my feet didn't hurt as much as I had expected. I duct taped every left toe and two on my right foot, plus put on a pair of clean dry socks. My shoes were still damp, but they dried out as I hiked—that is until this afternoon. Another thunderstorm rolled through. This is beginning to be a pattern. At least this time, I was within reach of a shelter before the cloudburst hit, along with eight others. Four other wet hikers arrived during the storm. I made coffee, then headed back out to hike another 6.4 miles through the now-wet trail to tonight's campsite near the .4-mile turnoff to the the shelter.
I met a family of four on the way to their car and thought to ask if they had any extra water. This way I'd be able to camp on the ridge without needing to go to the shelter—and the water source. Funny how you lower your standards out here. I guzzled down one unopened bottle of water, but I had no problem adding half of the daughter’s open bottle to my own water bottle. 
Not sure if it was the trail or the ripe black raspberries devoured under the power lines or the fact that I had a cup of coffee at 4 p.m., but today felt much better than yesterday. And this, despite the incredibly steep hill we had around midday that also had us traipsing through nettles for a long time. And including the rocks in the morning. I had expected today to be another day in the office—just working to get the miles done, which it still was—but not as exhaustingly so.
The last six miles was much smoother between the coffee break shelter and the campsite. The trail passed through a pine forest and across rolling pastures. And there were the black raspberry treats.
The last bit, after the berry patch, was Bruisers Knob. There are stacked piles of rocks up here—better than being underfoot, to be sure. Last year, a nice reader pointed out that the piles I had been observing in in the mid-Atlantic states were the result of mining operations and not, as I posited, the efforts of child or slave labor. Maybe someone knows why there are conical piles along this ridge in Virginia every fifty or so feet. I'll be a little unnerved if I find out I've camped in some civil war-era battle field. There are also apple trees here as well.","Stealth Campsite

Woke up in a damp low-lying cloud to find millipedes on everything. Picture armored earthworms with lots of feet. Half a dozen were clinging to the food bag paracord. Others were on the tent ropes. The worst were the ones exploring the sweaty bits of my backpack—which is basically the entire thing. I intended to reach a hostel tonight, but at 22 miles—that was going to mean another long day. And it was again hot. I rinsed the sweat out of my shirt in late morning and let it dry on my body while I hiked. A swim would be nice. 
And there were again PUDs. We went up Brush Mountain for the sole purpose of going right back down. However this afternoon’s ascent and descent of 3100-foot Brush Mountain was one of the nicer forested mountains to date. It had gentle switchbacks, unlike yesterday's sweat-pouring, calf-burning forced march straight up. No rhododendrons. Blueberries, oaks, evergreen trees and some kind of stone-colored lizard—meaning dry. The trail was carpeted with pine needles until the ridge line—which wasn't full of rocky scree like earlier this morning or yesterday. And the heat carried the scent of pine. It reminded me of Arizona. It reminded Screech of Colorado. Screech showed up today. He ended up being a day ahead of me ever  since we camped together on top of the Roan Highland Balds. Screech had taken a zero a few days ago in Pearisburg and that was all the time I needed to get ahead.
Meanwhile, Cindy Lou Who, Hendricks and I appear to be hiking similar daily distances. We don't hike together, but tend to see each other at breaks. Both of them are younger than my kids—and faster. 
At the bottom of Brush Mountain there was a large stream—with a swimming hole! Screech was in it and another couple were just packing up after their dip. Cindy Lou Who arrived as I was packing up. Swimming in my bra and the compression shorts I wear under my skirt allowed me to rinse the sweat out of them too. Then I hiked another 2.5 or three miles as they also dried on my body. The water did wonders. I probably could have hiked longer—I felt like it—but now that I was again up on a ridge line, there weren't a lot of stealth sites and I didn't want to end up hiking a while lot longer. Plus there are good breezes up here. I stopped at 7 and let my damp sleeping bag air out. The last few days I've been hiking until 8 or 8:30 p.m., so it almost felt like I stopped too soon. Screech was looking for a site too, but he has a hammock and doesn't need a flat spot. This is the third night in a row that I am stealth camping alone.
When I say stealth, it's not like I'm hiding. These are spots that people have carved out near the trail and just aren't official campsites. They aren't listed in the guidebook, but are generally present by streams and viewpoints. In tonight’s situation, my head is only eight feet away from the trail. Thus far, nobody has passed by in the two hours I've been set up. 
There was no afternoon thunderstorm today, although there was a chance in the forecast. And the swim replaced the late afternoon coffee pickup. Watched the sunset through the trees and the lightning bugs are now out. A good day even if I didn't get as far as planned. And without the rain, my socks have been able to dry out and my hot spots are healing.","Sarver Hollow

Yesterday, Cindy Lou Who reported that she had been awaken at dawn by some snorting and breathing sounds on either side of her tent. She’d been camping alone, in a field, by the Keefer Oak, the second largest oak tree found along the trail. A nose appeared under her tent fly,  nose of a cow. She unzipped the tent and found she was surrounded by a small herd.
Something woke me up around 4:30 this morning, and it wasn't cows, although I'm not sure what. I heard a snort too—and I made a bunch of noise, but nothing went crashing off. Nor did the snorting continue. I fell back asleep.
Today’s hike included Dragon’s Tooth, a monolithic rock accessed by a bit of technical rock scrambling. Slabs of vertical rock are precipitously balanced and, in places, held only by tree roots until the time that ice shears them free. This was a taste of New Hampshire/southern Maine. In places, I grabbed onto adjacent tree trunks polished smooth by thousands of hiker hands. 
This is a day when I didn't pass, or was passed by, too many other hikers. Space Ghost, a young man from Wisconsin whom I met in a shelter a few days ago while waiting out a storm, was the only person to catch up to me besides Cindy Lou Who, who almost always catches or passes me on a daily basis. She flew down Dragons Tooth as I carefully picked my steps—slowly hobbling exactly as I felt this grandmother of two needed to do. My knees, while pain-free, are still not as bendy as that of a 19-year-old.
Space Ghost and I talked and hike together for a few miles and I followed him to,the Catawba Grocery where we each inhaled a cheeseburger and a beer. At 10:45 a.m. 
I headed out with a double scoop ice-cream come and left him at the grocery store/gas station to recharge his phone. Arrived at Route 311 around 2:30 p.m. exactly at the time a thunderstorm rolled in. I was protected under a kiosk and had been reading about the camping/no camping options. Last year Spirit of 76 had told me that camping at Tinker Cliffs had been her best campsite—but the National Park Service Kiosk indicated we weren't supposed to camp there. And the most photographed scene on the entire trail—MacAfee Knob—was only 3.9 miles away—now in pouring rain. A voice in my head was reminding me that I could call for a shuttle and instead slack this section tomorrow when the weather was reportedly going to be clear. 
I wimped out and called. 
Tonight finds me ensconced in a tacky Daleville, Virginia Howard Johnson, where my next food drop has been delivered. I would be here anyway tomorrow night, so—what the heck. A shower. A bed. And wouldn't you know it, clear skies again. 
Also--it's very apparent that hikers are contributing to the economic existence of this hotel. Most of the guests appear to be hikers.
I'm now a day ahead of the people I’ve been hiking with—and the weird thing is that there are exactly zero familiar faces here tonight.","Stealth Campiste/Dragons Tooth Ridgeline

Good call on waiting for a better day to see MacAfee Knob. No rain today. My shuttle driver told me that this area is visited by 500-600 people each weekend. On this day there were only eight of us reaching the iconic vista mid-morning. 
It turns out, that for me, MacAfee Knob is more that the most photographed section of the trail. I passed my 2000-mile mark here. I took a break to secure the requisite photo, then created my 2000-mile marker image. 
Today was long and felt like work. I don't think I should do these many miles. Even though I had a room awaiting me, I felt pressure to get there and it wasn't fun to force myself o make the miles.
This was a nice section of trail. It reminded me a lot of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore minus Lake Superior. The AT skirted Tinker Cliffs, where I stopped for lunch. The trail remained high within pines and paved by sandy soil, and the occasional rocks. I saw bear #8 along the ridge near one of the overlooks after Tinker Cliffs. I was listening to a podcast and looking down, as one does, when noises—both vocal and the tearing of bark—caught my attention not twenty yards ahead. A cub was furtively scrambling down from a pine tree and took off down hill. Yikes! I yelled out: “Where are you mama?” and backed away furtively looking everywhere myself. Belted out my first iTunes library song “Ahead By A Century” by the Tragically Hip at full volume, clicked my trekking poles together, talked and cautiously moved up the trail. Never saw mama, thankfully, and headed on for ten more minutes before I absolutely had to pee. Thanks adrenaline.
Later, I stopped for water nimbly scrambling down a short bank to a stream. After filling up my water bottle, I headed back up to my pack when I then noticed a large brown snake inches from my previously chosen path. I created a new one giving it wide berth even though it lacked the triangle venomous head shape and never really moved. 
And the cicadas are out screeching up a racket. 
I didn't get back until after 6 p.m., but decided I should pick up some groceries and perhaps check out the outfitter to see about new shoes. The trail was quite rocky for about five miles and my feet have been getting sore. Trying on new shoes did feel better on my feet, so I went ahead a bought a new pair of replacement Obozs. My original pair has held up well—or I had assumed they had. When I returned to my room and compared the soles, turns out I REALLY did need new ones. The lugs on the old pair were worn completely away in places and I think even some of the substructure was showing in the heels. I was attempting to make them last until the end—but after more than 700, likely more like 900-plus miles, they had done their job.
Another surprise was awaiting for me when I got back from shopping—Grade School hadn't yet left. She had left her guidebook in another hiker’s room, who wasn't back from dinner. So she decided to stay in my room’s second bed. So we had a chance to catch up since  Damascus. 
And Cindy Lou Who and Hendricks checked in. Tonight I recognize many more faces. 
I decided to stay a third night and do a second day of slacking tomorrow—just not as long. This will give me time to get laundry done,  catch up on some writing and –plan for my final NINE days. Sam and have talked and decided to proceed with a finish date of June 30—when he will meet me at Shenandoah, where I started this crazy trip 14.5 months ago. As of tomorrow, I need only average 13.4 miles/day. We now have a plan and the end is in sight. A mere 120 miles to go! Those shoes will be practically new.","VA 311

I'll say the new shoes made the difference. Or the trail was gentle. Or the day pleasant? In any event, today’s 14-mile plus slack was so much easier than yesterday's. I felt like the time flew by instead of slogging. Had pleantynof time to get the laundry done upon my return.
I got dropped off on the Blue Ridge Parkway, Mile Post 97/Taylor Mountain, and hiked back to Daleville. It was a quiet start, although I could hear interstate 81 for most of the day after I summited the first mountain. 
Today, the first day of summer, was naked hiker day. Passed by a whole bunch of people I didn't know, and a few I did. All of them clothed. Only one woman was in a bikini and one guy was decidedly under dressed for hiking in his red brief. It may have been Space Ghost, but if it was, I didn't recognize him.","Daleville, Virginia

Turns out yesterday’s red-briefed hiker was not Space Ghost after all, since he was sitting at a table this morning. His mom had sent him a care package that included a copy of Madison’s Isthmus newspaper. He filled me in on the concert schedule he'll be missing. Then we observed that the Howard Johnson’s complimentary breakfast buffet used an entirely obscene amount of styrofoam—from the coffee cups to the plates to the cereal bowls. I probably generated more trash at one meal than I have all week on the trail. 
The shuttle deposited another slack packer, Road Warrior, and I back on the trail off of the Blue Ridge Parkway—he another two miles ahead of where I had started yesterday. Most of the morning, the trail paralleled the parkway, reminding me of Skyline Drive in Shenandoah. I caught up to Road Warrior about five miles in and he said he was already having a rough day. My goal was to only do 13.9 miles to a swimming hole/camping area, but when I arrived, there was an uncommunicative guy who I could smell at fifty paces, with all his gear spread out preventing me from reaching the swimming hole. The “hole” had been created by stacked rocks to hold back water near a slightly graffiti-decorated bridge. I decided I didn't need a swim after all. And the camping was right by a road. It was still early, so I pushed on to the next shelter four miles further. The weather report this morning suggested Tropical Storm Cindy might dropped some rain overnight, and the guidebook indicated the shelter was a big one--holding up to 20 people.
The gnats and no-see-ums are beginning to be more noticeable, but I still have yet to resort to spray. Instead, I'm festooned with Sassafras leaves, which reportedly repels insects. Thus far the whining hasn't ceased and I look like Julius Caesar. 
There are lots of blueberries and they are very much ripe right now. How come I've never heard about Virginia blueberries before?
About three miles in, I was passed by incommunicado guy, with packages of ramen noodles spilling from the plastic bag hanging from his pack. He stopped to pick up the errant items and kept moving without fixing anything. He was sitting at the shelter picnic table when I arrived, his food now spread out all over the table. As of 9:30 p.m., with dusk settling and amidst dancing fireflies, he still sits and has yet talked to no one but himself. He chain smokes and coughs and at one point he had three lit cigarettes resting on the picnic table. I initially  though it might be to ward off biting insects, but I don't think he is actually thinking that lucidly. I'd be more concerned if I was here alone, but there are a dozen of us in the shelter and/or camping nearby. The other shelter occupants have been speculating that he is either tripping on something or possibly has Tourette's. 
I'm also on the top floor of one of the most awesome shelter to date. Timber frame, post and beam construction erected without nails and with offering different seating and cooking arrangements and platforms, The loft area, accessible only by rungs (which, incidentally, I don't think the chain smoking tripper can easily navigate, especially with three other guys below it) is open air. I do so hope it rains tonight. 
If this wasn't such a nice shelter—and large—it can hold at least 20 people—I'd opt to sleep in my tent. One of the disadvantages, besides stinky people—is the arrival of the night hikers. A group of six loud ones arrived around 7 p.m., heralded by heavy metal music blaring from one guy's speaker as he took a “short cut” up a hill instead of using the steps. He decided they would be hiking another seven miles yet tonight. For many hikers, particularly the younger ones, hiking appears to be a group experience despite having first arrived on the trail alone. Over time, some start forming groups and collectively become a pack, and in tonight’s preview, an obnoxious pack. God created earphones for a reason. It makes me wonder how hiking with  group dynamics gels with someone who might not want to hike the distance that the charismatic leader decides, but doesn't want to be left behind. But. Not my problem.
Anyhow, I was fine with their decision to push on. Spent the evening talking about upstate New York with Blue Hat,  a woman section hiking who is a little older than me and is sharing the loft. And who doesn't hike with heavy metal blasting—at least that I know of.","BRP 97/Taylor Mountain Overlook

So. It did rain last night and I'm alive. The rain was lovely, but our chain smoking, possibly meth head, was odd, to say the least. He ended up sitting at the picnic table out front for at least six hours. The rain started around midnight, which is when I looked at the time and still saw the glow of his cigarette. The rain might have been the only thing that forced him away from the table and into the shelter. This morning there were four empty cigarette packages and a tableful of wet food and gear. He did manage to set up a sleeping bag and blow up mattress. He remained in his bed while everyone packed up around him this morning, and when he did get up, he paced and asked another hiker for a cigarette. 
Cindy Lou Who and Hendricks arrived just as I was getting ready to leave. They had camped three miles short of the shelter. Hendricks was going to make breakfast but the chain smoking meth head made him feel uncomfortable too. We later learned that from other hikers who had stopped by that he hadn't moved all day and wanted to know the closest place to buy cigarettes. 
The trail today was mostly up. Hendricks caught up to me after his aborted breakfast and we spotted a yellow and brown tortoise in the middle of the trail. I had been hearing about sightings both years, but this was the first tortoise I saw.
Stopped at a shelter at the 10.9 mile mark, where I again ran into Cindy Lou Who and Hendricks also taking a break. Cindy is ending her hike in Harper's Ferry so she can get ready to leave for Nepal this fall. Hendricks wants to aqua blaze (canoe) the Shenandoah River instead of hike the trail through the national park. Weeks ago, I had said goodbye to them, assuming they would be faster. However, the three of us have had very similar paces and I jokingly keep telling them; “Well, this is it. Goodbye!” Today, however, they talked of doing 17 and 18 mile days, whereas I have to slow down, working with Sam’s arrival date on June 30. Warden and Luke arrived (bearing the news of the chain smoking meth head. Actually, Luke is the one who suggested that), and took a photo of the three of us—because I think this is really it. Tomorrow they should be getting ahead of me and staying ahead. Today I learned their real names and they mine, so we can find each other on Facebook. It's like we all have an alias--but it's our real life.
Hiked another five miles after the shelter, following the Blue Ridge Parkway again, as well as two very tame deer. Am camping alone just past a forest service road. The official campsite three miles back was in a damp, dark although relatively rhododendron-free spot with a note scrawled on the water sign saying bears visit here. Even though it was dated 5/2016, I didn't feel like testing that warning. Tonight's campsite has a perfect bear bag branch—best one yet to date. Grade School told me she lost her ill-hung food to a bear at the Wise Shelter back by the Grayson Highlands, the same shelter I talked about regarding the guy who didn't think bears bothered shelters where there were lots of people. At least, I hope it is a perfect bear branch and better campsite tonight. 
As of today, or maybe yesterday—the meth head preoccupied my thoughts—I have less than 100 miles to the finish.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

The weather report indicated a cold front was going to be moving in overnight and does it ever feel good this morning! By cold, I'm guessing it's in the 60s, but drier and very windy. A little rain fell and the winds picked up, but give me this over the humidity any day. Of course, it didn't completely last, it again got hot.
Unlike yesterday, today was mostly down. I hiked through two wilderness areas including James River which was a very nice section of trail leading down to the highway where the shuttle to Stanimals Hostel was awaiting my arrival. The trail meandered through red pines, hickory and oaks high above the James River. There were even a few views. And blueberries. Lots of blueberries.
Met a mom with three elementary-aged children in the midst of their hike from Damascus to Harpers Ferry today. She and the two youngest hiked the entire trail once already over a two year period and are back to fill in a section that the eldest missed. 
At one point, some animal flashed away from me—like a squirrel, but it was bigger, faster and it seemed to have pointy ears like a bobcat, but it wasn't that big. It's a mystery. The black snake that zipped across the trail, however, was no mystery.

Since I can't go fast, I decided to again slack—returning me for a second night to the hostel. Plus, it gave me the opportunity to really say goodbye to Cindy Lou Who and Hendricks, whom I thought would have caught up to me yesterday before I reached the hostel. So once again, I saw them as I headed south. The surprise for me, though, turned out to see Grade School. She had taken a zero or nero the day before and I basically caught up with the speed demon once again. All four of us met atop of Bluff Mountain—me less than three miles into today's hike—and they more than six. We talked for almost a half hour by a note on a old fire tower footing saying “Beware. Copperheads.” I took a bunch of selfies and hugged them all. Our stories will be forever interwoven within our individual trips—for good or for bad. I looked up when I first met Cindy Lou and Hendricks and it was back on Day 12. 
The shuttle driver dropped off the other hostel guest, a very fit, very much older French-speaking only man back at the trail head and then took me up the Blue Ridge Parkway for my slacking day. 
The driver is retired and admits to be an internet troll. For fun. Says it gives him something to do and he plays both sides. I say let's get him more hikers to occupy his free time with shuttling. A lot of shuttle drivers are doing this in their retirement—driving that is. I hope they aren't all trolls. They are at least nice in the car. 
Most of the older retired guys haven't hiked much, if any, of the trail and their advice is hearsay. Today I was warned about my first steep climb—which turned out to be like all the others. Like DataGirl, (not her real trail name, but should have been) from a few weeks back, who was always announcing the elevation differences, I don't really want to hear how bad (or how easy) your interpretation might be. The mountain was there. The trail lead over it. I climbed it. I descended it. End of story. 
I remember the climb out of Fontana Dam into the Smokies. Five, or was it nine, miles all up. With a huge resupply. I knew I had all day to do it and eventually I was there. So—you just do these mountains. Because they are there. 
Slacking works for me because I carrying less weight and there's less stress on these aging overworked joints. I'm writing daily so being in town allows me the time and electricity to upload posts. Plus, it keeps me moving ahead physically and psychologically. Because the trail is always there.
And today the trail was pretty good today. Perhaps due to the lack of weight, it felt easy. And there were plenty of black raspberries for the picking. The air and temperature also was pleasant. None of this oppressive heat crap. Bugs are still out, though. I've read other people's journals reporting being eaten up, so I suppose I should be happy I only have to tolerate the whines. 
Coming back to town, the trail followed a picturesque creek with ledges and small waterfalls.  Arrived back at 2 p.m. as arranged and spent the rest of the afternoon working on a Trek blog post. Hours later, it's finally done. 
Blue Hat is here at the hostel tonight. She was with me in the loft the night we spent with the chain smoking meth head. Road Warrior reported seeing him a day later as week—crap still spread out and circling around the picnic table. He opted to move on too. Sad.

The shuttle brought Blue Hat, Road Warrior, Snake Eater and I to the Blue Ridge Parkway overlook—the three of them are slacking the same section southbound that I did yesterday—while I'm heading on northbound. 
The trail was again nice today and the temps perfect. Sunny, but not too hot. Only one big 3000-foot climb and even that didn't make me feel overly sweaty. 
Regardless, my pack smells so nasty. Any heat releases the nastiness exuding from the fibrous depths of the padded back panel and straps. There's nothing I can do about that right now. I attempt to ignore it.
After two days of less than eleven-mile days, and even though I hiked over 2100 miles as of today, I started having weird self-doubts about doing 15 miles or more with a full pack. Now that I have a deadline, I have to maintain a certain mileage. I was thinking about camping around the 16-mile mark, where a view was noted in my guidebook. 
But a few things changed that plan.
1) First of all, I had no clue that the trail followed a reservoir lake today. Most of the time, it was inaccessible, but as it reached the far end, the trail dipped down close enough to be able to access the shoreline where many “No Camping” signs were posted. But it made for a great lunch spot. I stayed there from 11 to 1:30. I haven't spent these kinds of moments sitting for any length of time, quietly observing. Of course, there haven't been any accessible lakes until now either. Sitting against a pine tree, reading, eating lunch, listening to squirrels chattering and giving chase, tiny claws skittering along the peeling bark, blue jays barking. Or I just stared at the water reinforcing once again that I do so prefer lakes over mountains. It was very peaceful except for the two times military planes broke the silence, the sound reaching me before the sight of them.
2) Even after hanging out by the lake that long, I made good time—even with the big climb and was surprised to find that the view was a huge open bald—also signed with “No Camping.” There was one site with one tent with a man with whom I didn’t feel completely comfortable. He was only out for a night or two and wasn't creepy so much as overly chatty. If I had been hiking with another person, I would have stayed, but instead I reluctantly moved on. It would have been a fantastic camp site. 
But as is turns out, tonight's campsite in Hog Gap is also in an open meadow. There are several hikers camped nearby including the mom and her three kids who I can hear are watching a video in their tent as I write. All four carry packs, but Mama Bear has the biggest. She must be carrying a battery pack too. 
An owl is hooting and the sun has set. 9:15 p.m. Hiker midnight.

Woke up to the sounds of huffing and heavy breathing in an otherwise dark, silent night. And it wasn't coming from my neighbor’s tent. I had my food bag hung high, but it was at the end of a light branch and tied to the trunk of the same tree, meaning that an habituated bear making the rounds in an established and well-used campground could easily scale the tree trunk, cutting through the paracord and down the bag would fall. I listened breathless and slightly  paralyzed. The tree was not very far from where I was entombed within the walls of my thin nylon tent. Now I'm not certain I actually heard a bear, but I didn't wait to find out. I yelled and made some noise. There wasn't any crashing, but the huffing moved on. On the other hand, it might have just been a deer—but they snort more than snuffle. 
I finally fell back asleep listening to a pair of barred owls hooting like Amazon rainforest howler monkeys. A much more relaxing sound.
The spring for this campsite is located .3 miles away and I needed to fetch more water. Water bubbled up from the ground within a large metal ring. Not sure about the history of this campsite, but it would appear to have been some sort of homestead—with cleared land (this meadow is huge), apple trees and the improved water source. Or maybe, like the name, this was a hog farm. 
Yesterday, the trail meandered along Brown Mountain Creek, where stone walls and a few crumbling chimneys still struggled to remain standing within the encroaching forest, remnants of a former freed-slave community. I only know this from the two kiosk signs located along the way. Like the reservoir lake I lingered at yesterday, AWOL’s guidebook doesn't call out anything not specifically relevant to a hiker’s need.
I was the first one up and about at 7 a.m. All the other tents were still zipped up tight. I know the family is only headed to Harper's Ferry, but if the other tents hold through-hikers, I continue to be surprised that they aren't on the move by 7. Especially with the longer days of summer now stretching out for them and Kathdin still three or four months ahead. With only a 14-mile day for me today, I can linger over breakfast.
A friend of mine, Laurie, will be able to meet Sam and I for breakfast on Saturday after I finish. Coincidentally Laurie was able to meet me during my first week in the Shenandoahs last year while she was in Virginia visiting her daughter. She had emailed suggesting I might be walking slower, reflecting and savoring these final days and miles. I am trying to make the most of this time, but today, like all the other days, the trail looks more or less the same and I still am looking down most of the time. I conjure up moments now and then, but mostly I just keep placing one foot in front of the other. I am going slower—holding back until Sam’s arrival.
One thing I do recall, however, was the overwhelming feeling while reviewing the maps after summiting Katahdin last year. I saw a bunch of big peaks I’d have to hit when I'd flip and it was not making me happy. It looked like hell. But now, tonight, more than half a year later, I am camping atop the Priest—a 4000-foot summit that had caused me such consternation and is turning out to be of my best campsites to date. I made dinner sitting upon sun-warmed boulders overlooking a sea of mountains as the sun set. This is how I had imagined the trail to be. It's how the trail was for me in Maine. Three other people are present sharing this completely obvious stealth campsite with me.

Forgot to mention that I had signed the confessional in the Priest Shelter Trail Journal yesterday before heading on to the summit. The journal is full of fun things to read—better than more shelter journals. 
I ate breakfast on the same summit boulders where dinner had been made. It was still chilly—wore my rain jacket again for warmth, but I'll take this over heat any day. This was definitely one of my best campsites to date. Red Beard and Kaitlin were still in their tent when I left at 8. 
I had been led to believe that the Priest Mountain descent was worse than Dragon’s Tooth, but it was only long, not treacherous. Really no different from anything else to date. Crossed a highway and over a suspension bridge. There were inviting smooth boulders along the creek shoreline and I took an early break, soaking my feet and reading a few more chapters from Jewelweed. This is the only book of three (all housed on my iPad) that I've cracked and I am only now reading with any regularity. 
Beside descending the Priest, today's section included another PUD—another almost as high mountain to simply go up and then back down. At the seven mile mark, I encountered a blue blazed trail indicating it was only three miles to the next shelter vs. the 6.1-miles following the A.T. Hmmmm…
Last night Flash, the southbound hiker had told me he had stayed at the Devils Backbone Brewpub—a hiker-friendly facility. Apparently they let hikers sleep in the woods and you can get a $5 breakfast and get shuttled back. It's five miles off trail, so the trick is getting a ride. A shortcut would make this idea feasible…but I’d technically be skipping 3.1 miles, thus the above asterisk to today's data points.
I definitely have a case of senoritis. I'm almost done. This mountain is big and the trail totally just goes up and right back done. Both trails lead to the same point. It's only a difference of 3.1 miles. I've already done more than 2000 miles, which is minimum that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy recognizes for completion anyway. I could charge my phone. There is beer. Done. I started following the blue blazes.
Long story short: Shorter does not mean easier.
I had assumed that the blue blaze would simply cut off the summit climb. Boy was I wrong. The Mau-Har blue blaze began in the usual way and about halfway, it reach some fantastic waterfalls. I smugly thought—what a better decision! Except for New Hampshire’s White Mountains, the A.T. rarely passes by this kind of scenery. There was a nice campsite adjacent near several clear swimming holes. I was moving on when I thought, what the heck—I should take the time to swim. After all, this is a shortcut and I need to slow down. So I headed back to the campsite and went for a super fast skinny dip. I wasn’t on the AT highway, so the risk of being seen was minimal at best. That done—and it felt so good—I continued expecting to reconnect with the AT again within an hour or less. Nearly two hours later, I was beginning to think I had made a huge mistake. Surely that shelter was over the next hill. I climbed and climbed and climbed. I had given myself until 3 p.m. and then I would retrace my steps—something that by now seemed insane, yet I wasn't certain where this trail was leading. It just seemed to be taking way too long and was too high. My guidebook (and the sign) only told of distances—it isn't a topo map. 
Finally, at 2:50, the roof of the shelter, and the AT, came into view. The kicker: On the blue blaze trail sign posted by the shelter, there read this: “While the 3.0 May-Har trail is shorter, it is more strenuous and will take as long as hiking the 6.1 Appalachian Trail section.” 
That would have been nice to know. Regardless, the waterfalls and swim were worth it and only slightly overshadowed by my anxiety of correctly reaching the shelter turnoff.
Thus a visit to the brewery became a self-soothing priority. I reached the road before 4 p.m. and got a hitch within five minutes from a nice young man whose grandmother lives in Wisconsin. And I am indeed camped in the woods behind this vortex of a brewery. It's located near Wintergreen, a resort in the mountains. There are native flowers, two green houses, huge meadows and lots of outdoor seating. Nothing too urban about being here. Except I'm camping behind a brewery. 
There are a other few hikers camping here tonight including the family who I saw two nights ago in the meadow. I looked up bear huffing noises while online (thank you brewery!) and now I think it might have just been a deer. I'll have to let the family know. They heard me yell that night.

And today is the last full day on the trail.
Except for the constant sticky feeling, I slept great last night. Took advantage of the $5 hiker breakfast (eggs, potatoes, bacon, biscuit, fruit and coffee—no beer), then bought a croissant, then a green smoothie—while catching up on writing, reading emails that made me tear up and charging my devices—until the free shuttle brought us back to the trailhead. 
It was warmer than yesterday—of course not starting until 10:30 a.m. didn’t help. I thought it was more humid too, until I realized my glasses were just filmy and hadn't been cleaned in some time.
The trail would have been very annoying if it hadn't been for the fact that I'm almost done. At least the rhododendrons are mostly absent now. But much of the day was spent hiking over cobbles, boulders and assorted broken rocks. It was only toward the end, as the trail intersected with other park trails, ones accessible from nearby parking lots, that they became smoother. Coincidence? I think not. 
I saw the usual, now almost daily, deer sightings and what at first appeared to be a squirrel with a dead chipmunk in its mouth—which would be odd, right? It got closer before bounding off over a log and was more weasel like. So perhaps a weasel or a mink. Squirrels and chippers typical cohabit peacefully. And squirrels are not carnivorous—unless something has gone terribly wrong in these Virginian forests.
Sounds of mundane life can be heard all the way from up high—dogs barking, someone mowing their lawn. Tomorrow I'll be back down there, a part of that life again. I look out one final time over the waves of rolling ridge lines toward the Shenandoahs, goosebumps rising, a lump forming in my throat. I know I've hiked all the way from Georgia to be here. 
I listened to all of my Bruce Cockburn songs including sources of these nostalgia:- All The Diamonds In The World, the first Bruce Cockburn song I discovered and one which I'd frequently requested to be played by my college radio station disc jockey husband - Wondering Where The Lions Are, one of my theme songs from my 2011 NFCT thru-paddle trip- Last Night of the World, the first song of a concert Sam, I and our son Kagan attended in Madison a few years back, on a night in May, the date and year some nut job had predicted the end of the world 
My theme song for this trip is Ahead By A Century, by The Tragically Hip—because its both an ear worm and it's the first song on my playlist. In case you were wondering.
Something about the path reminded me of my last day approaching Katahdin and with a jolt I realize I'm in the same mental place as I was a year ago—playing music, envisioning Sam meeting me at the end, getting all emotional while at the same time looking forward to ditching these damp clothes. This incredibly odiferous backpack. 
My other pair of hiking undies now has holes, so they'll be history come tomorrow. Actually just about everything I've been wearing for the past fifty-nine days. 
The same group who camped last night at the brewery is all here tonight at the shelter. I'm camping next to the family who has told me that they are watching installments of Mary Poppins. We are set up next to the small, narrow waterfall—not unlike yesterday's blue blaze (which incidentally all seven of us took). I jumped in a small pool, this time with most of my clothes on, both to cool off as well as to rinse away some of the salty sweat. 
The waterfall just outside my tent is white noise and the warblers are announcing dusk.

I slept well. The clothes I had swam in yesterday are dry. My sleeping bag was warm, but not sticky. The gurgling waterfall, soothing.
This morning was the last time I deflated and rolled up my pillow, stuffed my sleeping bag into the compressible waterproof stuff sack, fold the Thermorest into thirds, roll it up squishing out the remaining air. It was the last time I changed back into five-day old clothes, a damp bra, yesterdays socks. I stuck the phone and headphones into my right side skirt pocket and today's map page into my left. I tucked my head lamp and battery recharger into their own yellow bag, threw my sleeping clothes into its stuff sack.
I slid on the elastic ankle brace, worn since day three, when I sprained my left ankle during a tumble on Blood Mountain. Next come the socks, now dry from yesterday's use. I slip on the gaiters. The aired-out insoles are replaced back into the shoes. Shoes go on, laces tied, gaiters hooked. 
Everything inside the tent was wrapped up.
Next—the tent: I untie a guyline that doubles as my clothes line, twisting the paracord into a butterfly skein. The Tyvek floor cloth was removed, the trekking poles pulled out one side side, then the other. Stakes are removed and then the tent is rolled up into a tight package for the stuff sack. 
I retrieved the food bag from the bear cable, screwed the stove onto the fuel canister, lit the stove, boiled water, made coffee—two packets of Tasters Choice instant coffee and a shot of a new shelf-stable creamer I discovered last year. Breakfast consisted of split pea and ham soup, one of two dinners I still had left—so much more preferable to the ever-present oatmeal.  
I brush my teeth using the coffee cup water rinse water, then turn the toothbrush as a pot scrubber, using it to clean off any last coffee residue from the cup.
The sleeping bag and Thermorest are the first to be packed into the bottom of my pack. They fit side by side within a heavy duty white trash-compactor bag intended to keep the all-important dry things dry. The clothes bag is next and the compactor bag top rolled down. There's no rain in the forecast until later this afternoon, well after the time I will be done. The rain jacket is stuffed into the bag’s depth, filling open spaces left by the rigid oval-shaped stuff sacks. If rain is possible, I keep the jacket strapped on top. 
The folded piece of Tyvek goes on top of this. It acts as a further water barrier when things get packed wet. 
My small foam sit-upon slides in against the back panel and the bubble wrap envelop contains a Z-Pak waterproof pouch holding the iPad Mini and loose leaf pages of guidebook sections slides into front, further cushioned by the outside net pocket.
The food bag, now bearing only a quart-sized ziplock bag of garbage, two uneaten packets of instant oatmeal and one dinner, is loaded next. The most I carried is seven days worth of food—heading into Great Smokey Mountain National Park—which turned out to be three days too much. In retrospect that climb out of Fontana Dam could have been much lighter, the food bag far less bulging, but I couldn't have predicted that at the time.
Three units of gear top off my final preparations. The small yellow bag containing the chargers, headlamp, personal items (although not a comb or brush), emergency items and mostly unused first aid items. The second is the GSI Haluite cookpot holding the fuel canister, stove, and my spoon when I don't need it for lunch. This is tucked into a DIY Reflectix cozy. Finally there is a net bag holding my main luxury item, a titanium coffee cup, the bear bag paracord rope, a small microfiber towel for pot drying and a small bottle of Dr. Browner’s lavender soap, soap that I used for my sponge baths more than dish washing. 
The top of the pack is rolled down and buckled.
Two water bottles, one containing the last water I'll need to drink for a while with tiny unidentifiable floating bits of organic stream debris, with my Steripen water purifier, go into the right outside pocket and the tent and umbrella are shoved deep into the left one.
A variety of protein, power, candy and/or granola bars has been placed into the left hip belt pocket, along with a pint sized Ziplok baggie of lentils, chickpeas or pesto, left to rehydrate during the morning and eaten with tortillas or as a salad for lunch. Most days I carry five or more bars. Today, there are only two. The last two.
My right hip belt pocket holds sunscreen, lip balm, toilet paper, hand sanitizer and until two days ago, insect repellent. I never used it and gave it away to Bell whom the bugs found more desirable than I. I did keep the Benadryl anti-itch stick—a few ankle biters still got me.
Finally, I checked to see that the trowel, rain kilt, pack cover and two-quart collapsible platypus water bottle are still there. My camp shoe Crocs are attached to the velcro straps, the pee rag tucked into the bungee cords—and I'm off.
Sunlight reaches this gap, dapples the rocks and leaf litter. Hickory nuts occasionally fall. A deer wanders nearby. The sounds of the waterfall from my stream-side campsite fade and are replaced by the cacophony of Pilated woodpeckers and cicadas. The air is heating up. It's going to be a hot day.
Space Ghost, another Wisconsinite with whom I had enjoyed a 10:45 a.m. beer at the Catawba Grocery, catches up to me. He arrived at the shelter last night after dark. We talk for a while and he falls into step with me. It was nice to catch up and be able to say goodbye, but I sent him on. I wanted to finish hiking the same way I started—alone.
While Podcasts have kept me sane through some of the more challenging days, I let my iPhone playlist shuffle, looping through a forever soundtrack tied to this singular moment. 
I think about musicians and songwriters whose chords and lyrics resonate, friends whose spirits carry me, strangers who share the same footsteps and follow the same trail but are on a completely different journey.
I text Sam letting him know I'm about 45 minutes away. He reports that he's just reached the Waynesboro, Virginia city limit. 
I reach the US 250 guardrail on the Blue Ridge Parkway, just before 11 a.m. and pause to consult my map. Still about a half mile more to reach that National Park sign, my final terminus. I look up and notice a parking lot across the road wondering if Sam might be waiting there. Then I look right, then left before crossing—and there is our car. After fifty-nine days and thousands of miles, we've literally found each other within minutes. 
Except I'm not quite done. 
He pulls over and embraces my sweaty body, my stinking pack. We take a few photos and I send him ahead where I again meet him at a big brown “Entering Shenandoah National Park” sign where two other families are also parked, posing for family photos. They get to see me cry—but only for a little bit. There's too much to talk about. Too much to celebrate.
