Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519820,"“I’ve decided I am going to walk the Appalachian Trail, and I’m starting in 2017. Want to join me?”This was the start of a conversation I had with my father (John) as my decision to walk the Appalachian Trail (AT) set in. Many years prior we had discussed the possibly of starting the trail but nothing had come of the idol conversation. This time was different; my mind was made up and the journey was to begin. I just had to decide when and how to make this dream into a reality. I also needed equipment, as previous to this conversation I had not thought about what it would take to make this dream a reality.From that point on, my focus shifted into high gear towards what type of equipment I would need. As funny as it may sound, after watching the movie “Wild”, I understood the issue of over packing and decided to start my search for equipment on just the basics: hiking shoes, backpack, tent, sleeping bag/mat, water purifier, and cooking equipment. The rest could be filled in over time. On my days off work I found myself in the local bookstores looking for hiking books with ideas of what would be necessary.   Although they were not very helpful regarding gear, I found a great book on the trail itself through NY, NJ, PA, and MD. This was just the start I was looking for… a little over 400 miles of trail that was driving distance from my house! Later the same week I found my book, John also found a book on selecting equipment that best fits your needs. It was a perfect combination, and gave us the tools we needed to get started.We compiled a list of the type of equipment we wanted based on the suggestions of his book and decided to go to the nearest Cabella’s to purchase some of those necessary items. Top on the list were hiking boots/shoes, closely followed by backpacks and a tent. After careful consideration, all three items were purchased, as well as thicker socks. We also took home multiple ideas for other items such as sleeping bags, water purifiers, and cooking gear that were purchased online at a later date. The only items left to be purchased are a first aid kit and a sleeping mat. Everything else would be incidentals which could be purchased as we find necessary.With the bulk of the most important gear purchased, John offered the idea of day hikes on the AT to start our journey. It was decided there was no reason to wait when we could do day trips while planning our week long adventure for 2017. We scheduled a hike for July 15, 2015 in NJ. Very quickly this dream was coming to fruition and the excitement was hardly able to be contained.",,The Adventure Begins…,"Jul 10, Fri",0

I am still in the market for the following:Sleeping PadWater Purifier (For Cooking Water)First Aid KitI will be honest in saying that I am unsure what else I would need, but that is why I am waiting almost 2 years before hiking more than one overnight at a time, so I can learn what essentials I need!

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519822,"Today is the day! I took my first step on the Appalachian Trail on my journey to hike the nearly 2,180 mile footpath from Georgia to Maine. The start to crossing a major item off my bucket list, even if it takes twenty years to do it! So where does an amazing adventure like this one begin? For me, it was at the Iris Trail Parking Lot in Sussex, NJ, and I was accompanied by John (my father) & Cindy (my mother). It has long been in both of their interests, and today was the day we were all able to accomplish something we have talked about for years!With a copy of this section of the trail in hand (pictured below), we set out for our day hike around 10am. Our plan was to start at the parking lot and hike up to the High Point Monument to have lunch. I pulled my backpack filled with supplies over my shoulders, clipping the buckles over my chest and waist for support, and started down Iris Trail to the A.T. As soon as we saw the white tree markers we knew we hit the trail. John took the lead and off we went.An hour later we took first major break as we finished our first mile on the A.T. This brought us to the wooden Observation Platform, where we were able to   view our first really spectacular glimpse of the High Point Monument (pictured below). From this distance you would never believe this veterans’ memorial stands 220ft above New Jersey’s highest peak of 1803ft. It still seemed so distant, although it was only another torturous half a mile over a very rocky, uphill trail until we would be at its base. This hike was definitely showing me why so many people would find this tough to accomplish. Already, I knew it was more mental then physical… but the physical is definately challenging as well. It was exactly the challenge I was hoping for!The threat of rain and high humidity convinced me to pack my cellphone (which I was using as a camera) into my pack and try to use my new go pro hero 4 instead. Unfortunately I was less successful with this as the memory card that was used in the device had some technical issues and almost of the videos formatted. I was only able to capture one… and as someone who prides myself on my ability to use technology, this is something that will have to be remedied for future hikes. That said, instead I was able to engulf myself in the hike itself, and enjoy the rejuvenation only nature can provide.We followed the red/green markers on a side trail off the A.T., and made it to High Point Monument. Here is where we stopped for lunch. I took the opportunity to use my new Stove and Cook set. Funny thing, although technology generally goes well for me, not all of my camping gear does. When connecting my stove to the butane tank, I got spooked when it started leaking and threw it into the grass because I hadn’t realized it just wasn’t on the burner tight enough! After composing myself, I realized the mistake that was made and went to rectify the situation so I could eat the meal I brought… but lost most of the heat source in the meantime. But hey! This is why I am taking small steps before just jumping in, so I can figure these things out and see what works for me!Once I got the stove under control, I poured some of my water and couscous into the pot to cook. It completed almost as fast as it does on the stove at home, and instantly I was impressed with how well my cooking option had worked. For this hike each of us packed our own lunches. I added a ranch tuna packet to my couscous and enjoyed my lunch!As we were eating the sky did open up to a light drizzle. It was enough to cool the skin and gave us the opportunity to see that the backpack rain cover works like a charm. The rain halted again just as we set out back down the mountain to the intersection with the A.T. where we then decided to try to make it down to the High Point Shelter .75 miles past the Monument. We made it about half way before there was an unanimous decision to turn around and head back to the car. Between the rocks and the hills it was proving much more difficult then we had imagined. I realized some training before the longer hikes would be imperative. Stamina and endurance is very important, and the right nutrition would make a huge difference.At mile number four we found a tree that had fallen and used it as a bench to rest for a few moments and replenish our liquids. The rain had stopped completely now, however it was still extremely humid. I took the opportunity to pull my cell phone back out to take a picture with my backpack and the path. Then we continued forward, retracing our steps to the start where our car was parked. With only half a mile left until we completed the first two and a quarter miles of our sojourn on the A.T., I decided to document each moment as the journey continues (and park a car at the end so we don’t have to double back!).","Iris Trail Parking Lot, NJ

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519823,"The hike standing before us today spread through a little under 5 miles of swamp land and farm land alike. John and I started out early from home, arriving at the exit of our trail hike around nine in the morning to leave the first of our cars on the side of the road. Then, with the other car we went north in attempts to find parking on Goldsmith Rd, which was our thought for a starting destination. We would have arrived sooner, however we thought an incorrect turn had occurred on Goldsmith Rd. and came to the “Murray Secret Shelter” where we met some very nice thru-hikers who explained to us they had no idea where we were and that the property we were on was a private one, so most likely there was not parking. With that in mind, we expanded our hike slightly to include from Unionville Rd. straight through to Rte. 519. Within a few minutes we were able to find street parking off of Unionville Rd and prepared to start our hike.By 10am we were ready to start our next section of the A.T. Within the first mile of our hike, we found ourselves walking on wooden planks the A.T. maintainers built for hikers to make it through these very soggy grounds in the Vernie Swamp. As the swamp lands ended, we made our way back up part of the mountain and found ourselves in between farm lands and wooded areas. Unlike the last hike, where it was mostly wooded area and very rocky pathways, this hike we were experiencing much different terrain. We had already gone from walking in the woods, to swamp land on wooden planks. Then up a hill to mowed down field pathways overlooking overgrown farmland.Our breaks took us to the most interesting places. The one place was a field where you could see the High Point Monument in the background. It was an interesting perspective to think we were trying to get back to that point, and it looked so far away from here! That very much put in perspective the amount of distance we were going to be covering. It also put in perspective how little ground we have covered in the big scheme of the whole A.T. This will take… forever! But hey, one mile at a time, right?!After soaking in how long this adventure really will take, We continued on up and down small rolling hills until we came to a creek with a bridge. By this time our water bottles were getting a little low. I had realized if I wanted to cook my lunch then I had better leave some of my water available. We do not yet have something to filter cooking water, only drinking water. This means John was able to fill his but I had to leave mine, so I stole a drink or three from his before we continued on. As a very interesting point of fact… this water tasted one hundred times better than John’s home town water. I am not sure what that says for the water here or there, but either way it was refreshing to have fresh tasting water part way through the hike!I am a very picture happy person, and someone who loves to capture visual memories since my mind does not always remember the finer details of the adventures I take. That said, different parts of the trail caught my eye and seemed picture worthy. I was extremely amused by the tree stump that was cut to form a pathway through it. It amused me even more at how many more were on the path that were not given the same convenient access. Then there were the stone paths, and the wooden bridges over picker bushes. Each section had its own personality and continued to entertain in a way television and electronic devices could not dream of.I love to photograph animals as well. We have not passed too many larger animals, but some of the smaller ones have been fun. This time we passed by a frog and a red spotted newt that were nice enough to pose for a small photo shoot. The newt I almost stepped on but John caught site of it first and brought it to my attention. I stopped to play with him, picking him up and placing him off the path as we had passed other hikers and I could only imagine him squished by someone else who was enjoying the view more than their own feet. The frog was in a pond where we filled John’s water bottle for the second time. I still still holding out for cooking water, and realizing quickly this was something I was going to have to remedy quickly. Next purchase is a way to clean water that isn’t my drinking bottle. That has been decided.Lunch break was quite a few hours after we started and almost all the way through our planned adventure. We stopped on a random tree trunk that was high enough to sit on, closer to a road than we had thought. I experimented with our stove again, this time making much less of a mess than the first time. I was able to screw the heat source without issue this time, and mastered much better the art of cooking the couscous without burning it to the bottom of the pot. Lunch consisted of couscous, ranch tuna, a donut peach, and veggie chips. It was delicious! John had brought with him sandwiches and tried some of the food I made so we could decide if it was a meal to take with us on our longer adventures. We decided it was.After lunch we repacked our gear and continued on to the end of our planned journey. It was only another mile until we reached the car, and we started talking about making up for the area we had not completed the time before. We still wanted to see the shelter just below the High Point Monument. The challenge was, it was ALL uphill to that point, and it was another 1.5 miles to get there. When we reached the car, and the destination we had planned to reach… we decided to try for the extra distance. We did not get too far, however. After tackling some man made steps on a mountainside, John realized physically he was unable to go any further so we turned around and went back down.Next time we will go the opposite direction, and head down the mountainside. For now, that was the end of this adventure.","Unionville Rd, NJ

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519824,"August 15 is my birthday, and this year my husband themed my birthday. All of my presents were something I was in need of or wanting for my overnight hikes. It was exciting to see more gear that would help complete my goal.   These gifts included the following (pictured below): a multitool, 85pc first aid kit, a sewing kit, an SOS mirror, ice cream, & a dehydrator!The dehydrator I’ve already used! I attempted to dehydrate multiple fruits including: Apples, Strawberries, Kiwi, Donut Peaches, & Bananas. Of these, I need to focus on drying the peaches and bananas a little more, but otherwise they were all very tasty! I will be experimenting with Jerky as well before my overnight trip in September!The other surprise my husband did for me is to make me a cake! He’s never baked before, and when the double fudge cake came out I was dumbfounded! The best part is that he made the A.T. on the cake! It includes a compass, trees, and the A.T. symbol in blue. If you look REALLY closely, you can see approximately where it is that I’ve covered so far on the map in blue! So thoughtful!!This brought me a few steps closer to my goal of having all the equipment needed to spend an overnight in the wilderness. It’s an awesome feeling to know the support and love my husband has for me even if he doesn’t understand the reasons I want to complete this goal. Now to go share my yummy new dehydrated fruit! Until next time…",,Happy Birthday To Me!,"Aug 15, Sat",0
Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519826,"I just got back from my first overnight on the A.T. and it was amazing! I’m tired, sore, and need about another three days off to recover… but with all that, I am ready to go back out there and keep at it! But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me tell you about just a small portion of what I was able to experience.
John and I began our journey where we left off last time, on Unionville Rd. in NJ. Cindy drove me and we followed John to where we ended, then she brought us back to the beginning of our hike and saw us off. We started very early, entering the trail around 8am in attempts to beat the heat. I’m going to give you a hint… it didn’t work. Boy it was hot out the last two days!
I wasn’t as picture happy this time around for the same things we had seen previously. I spent more time enjoying the views, and they were plentiful! Above are just two of the types of places we saw on our journey through the woods. We went through swamps, over streams, up and down valley and hills and continued our journey a little over three miles. The most interesting terrain the first day was when we came out on an actual road and followed that for at least half a mile. As a matter of fact, we followed an actual road, walking along the highway, until we made our way to the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge to walk the Liberty Loop Trail. Below are some of the pictures I took while on the Liberty Loop, including when we were finally going back into the protection of the trees!
At this point the sun was shining down and the wind was no where to be found. It was relieving to get back under the cover of leaves. To date, we were already further then we had been in previous hikes and still had at least a mile to go until we got to the shelter! Not only that, but we had a steep, rocky incline to combat as well.
The shelter was up a 400ft incline and did not have water readily available. About 1/10 of the way up the mountainside there was a house that the A.T. had purchased for use of the water on the back stoop. We got there without too much trouble and refilled our 3 1 liter bottles each. Then, with the understanding we needed water for dinner, the rest of the night, and for the start of our hike the second day… we also filled up a two gallon container that I took in my pack up the mountainous rocky terrain. Let me just say: I. AM. OUT. OF. SHAPE! That extra 16 pounds in my pack was treacherous work! That being said, we made it to Pochuck Shelter!!
We got to the shelter by 3pm and it felt to me like it was already going on midnight. My body ached, my lungs were on fire, and I was utterly exhausted. I could not get my backpack off fast enough and had my flip flops (yes, they are necessity!) on before John even had the chance to look around. Really, I didn’t either, I just had to get comfortable before I got into relax mode. Once I got changed, hung my soaking wet clothes out on rocks and in trees, and took a minute to breathe then I started to look around. John and I both checked out the Privy and the shelter, and John looked into the bear box that was provided at the shelter. This is a high bear area so being careful with food is a necessity. We then took a few minutes to nap, which was such a relief. At the end of the nap I woke up to footsteps. Blessed Wolverine came walking up to settle in for the night. By the end of the night two others joined, all longtime hikers, two going south-bound, one going north-bound. We are going scatter-bound. I’m making that up!
Around 6pm we finally decided to make dinner – Cous Cous Pizza. It was good, but it definitely wasn’t real pizza. That said, it was filling and nutritional which was most important to me, since we still had another day of hard hiking ahead of us. Then we sat and chatted with the other three guys who stayed at camp. We listened to the stories of those who started in GA and ME. Even thinking back, it just makes me want to go for more days in a row even more! But, I’ll be happy for what I can get and work on not feeling like all my muscles are on strike!
Bedtime was 9pm for everyone in camp. I don’t think I slept, although John states otherwise. I remember waking up multiple times and rolling around all night. Sleeping in the woods is most assuredly something I am going to have to become accustomed to quickly if I want to spend more nights and come to the morning with some rest.
The next morning before the sun came up one of the campers packed up and left for the trail, with a headlamp on! The sun wasn’t coming up for a few more hours. John and I went back to bed, however the other campers started to pack up and left at day break. We slept until around 7am, then I made breakfast for us of oatmeal and apples. After breakfast we packed up and started our day.
The second day’s hike started with another climb up the final portion of the mountain the shelter sits on. But it was worth every second when we got to the top and looked out at the view! It was a bit cloudy, but we could still see all the fields below, and the mountains on the far side of the outlook.
We stopped to take a moment to enjoy the scene and get some water and a snack, then continued on down the other side, enjoying the mostly down hill journey from this point to the end. For almost three miles I just enjoyed the walk and the views. The next thing that I found document worthy and just plain awesome is the gargantuan boardwalk stretching much farther than the eye can see.
As we walked on this boardwalk we spotted a suspension bridge in the distance. The closer we got, the more impressive it looked. I snapped a few pictures to show what that looked like as well. This sat over the Wawayanda Creek, where we filled the our water bottles for the last time to finish the hike.
Past the bridge was another mile to the end. By this time conversations ended and we just continued to push forward. We were tired and sore and ready to get out of the scorching sun. By the end, it was almost amusing. The final quarter mile ended with a train tracks crossing and walking across planks in a cow field! Yes, it was filled with said cows, but they were hiding in the shade. Smart cows.
Alright… Until Next Time!","Unionville Rd, NJ

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519829,"John and I took another day hike and completed six more miles of the A.T.   This walk was mostly much easier then the previous hikes we have taken so far, which is a nice change because we found ourselves able to look up from our feet more often and really enjoy the hike and all the beauty around us. It’s truly amazing to me how many different types of forest views there are within the same small footprint of the A.T. If there is such a vast difference in just the 1% we have covered so far, I can only imagine what the next 99% will bring! That being said, let me tell the tale of what we covered this time…To begin the hike, we started off pulling the car onto the side of the Warwick Tpk. Our second car was already parked at the end, in a small lot on RT 94. We decided to slack pack this trip, so all we had with us were our hiking poles, plenty of water, and lunch. I also brought a surprise and had with me homemade beef and venison jerky to share between the two of us , which we shared relately early in the hike as I could not keep the surprise hidden very long.The trail as I said earlier was much easier to hike for the first four miles or so, which was delightful. It provided the ability to really enjoy the ambiance and scenery surrounding us. The weather seemed to give in to autumn a day early, and provided us with a bit of a chill. The air was crisp and the wind was blowing slightly. Without the heat and humidity I found it much easier to find the energy to move forward without too much trouble. It was unbelievably relaxing.The first mile of the four housed the Wawayanda Shelter less than half a mile from the Wawayanda SP Headquarters, both of which we passed the blue blazed routes to. My interest was peaked in seeing another shelter, however as we drew closer to it I saw hikers were there and may have just been rising from a nights sleep. We turned back so as to not disturb them so early in the morning and continued on.Beyond the shelter the trail began a small climb to a crest, then a descent down through abandoned farm fields. Passed the fields, it continues downhill through some trees and comes to a steep area where stone steps were made to hike down to a stream. This was another awesome location that I could only imagine in the spring time when the water is full from the melting snow. The area consists of the stream, and of the very small bridge that was wired on both sides with a single wire to keep it from being washed away when the water levels rise.Here we stopped to have a small snack and to take a water break. You could hear the trickle of the water running down the rocks. Just a few steps up off the river bank there was a flat area you could clearly tell was used by hikers for camping. Without more than a moments thought I could see why the pull to stay here wold draw any hiker in. The sound of fresh running water, the view of the skyline, and the peace and quiet a location like this would provide would make for an amazing experience.After taking this all in, we continued up the trail, which started its ascent back up toward the crest of Wawayanda Mt, at which point there was a register box for those hiking the A.T. When John and I reached the box, we opened it and pulled out the notebook and pen. I jotted down a small note, today’s date, and our names. What amused me the most was that it was a mailbox tied/attached to a tree.Yes, again I say it was an old mailbox tied to a tree. I was impressed and amused. I was also excited as being to this point meant we were almost to what was called the Pinwheel”s Vista.   Less than a tenth of a mile from the Register Box we found the blue trail that led to the vista. This vista offers one of the best views in the whole state of NJ. It looks north to the Catskills and south toward the Delaware Water Gap. You can see from this view the entire length of the Kittatinny Ridge, which is topped by the High Point Monument, which is the location we hiked to for our first trip on the A.T. It was breathtaking to see how far we had come, and knowing that we had gone a full 2 miles past that Monument as well as a full 4 miles behind us. Looking down however, did also remind us that we were parked at the bottom of this mountain so the next step in our journey was to meander our way down.To reach the bottom of this mountain, came the descent down the 900-vertical-ft, boulder-strewn escapartment on a trail with switchbacks and over 400 stone steps. Within this downhill battle we found what is called the “Stairway to Heaven” which alone has 60 monstrous (300lb each) steps, dug into a 60 degree slope. This was taxing going down, so I could only imagine attempting to go up! I have also never seen so many rocks in my entire existence.The pictures I took were only of the staircases we were walking over. I just could not get a shot of side of the mountain good enough to explain the vastness that seemed to go on forever in the form of rocks! Its expanse was impressive and made me wonder what the actual “Rockies” looked like. They must house boulders! I decided some day I’m going to have to find out in person so I can compare. Pictures just don’t do justice.The trip down the side of the mountain stretched on trail reaching around a mile in length. It took us a good hour to accomplish the trek to the bottom, but we made it in one piece. It was rewarding to make it to the fields at the end of this hike and turn around to look back up at where we had just come from. I felt proud to be able to say we had even walked four miles beyond that point… from the stretch of woods that lies beyond that crest.And then just like that we were back at the car, another six miles behind us. I was already yearning for another stretch on the A.T. and hope the weather holds out for our planned overnight trip in October. Until then...","Warwick Tpk

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519830,"This hike was originally planned as an overnight stay, however our plans changed into two day trips when the weather got colder. At some point in this adventure we are sure to tackle less than thirty degree temperatures, however, at this time we have a choice, and we decided to stay warm and rest between the two days of hiking.The views on this particular hike were breathtaking. There were two particular overlooks that showed the vast expanse of land as far as the eye could see. Mountain ranges meeting with clouds in the far distance, and color everywhere. We could not have asked for a better day to hike, as the sky was clear and baby blue with fluffy clouds scattered throughout the sky. During our 5.3 mile walk we also came up with trail names! After being passed by other hikers, and people who were just out for a nice afternoon walk… I joked with John about how we are like the Tortoise and then I got stuck. Neither of us are the Hare, so I fumbled on my words. John chimed in stating, “And the Snail.” We both got a laugh and moved forward with our conversation, however those words stuck with me. The Tortoise and the Snail. Those names were fitting. Slow and steady, unwilling to give up. And both amusingly enough have shells (Backpacks). It seemed like a great fit and I liked it, but decided to sleep on it before making a decision. Hint: We decided to keep the names! Want to guess which one each of us are?I am the Tortoise. John is the Snail.We finished early and quickly on this hike, and asked ourselves if we are getting used to the terrain or if this stretch was a slight bit easier than the previous we have accomplished. I decided the answer was all of the above. We started around 9:30am on the trail and left for home around 1:30pm, which was almost two hours faster than our previous day hikes for the same distance. To top that, the car snuck up on us! We were getting back into the groove of hiking after a quick break, and a picture opportunity with a Gardener Snake, and all of a sudden the parking lot was in front of us.We packed up our gear into the car and drove home together. We will be returning so we left my car in the overnight lot in anticipation for tomorrow.","Deckertown Tpk, NJ

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519831,"For basically two different day hikes, we have been attempting to complete this two mile section of the trail. Altogether we most likely ended up doubling back for at least half of the distance. Today it seems to be much less trouble to complete than the previous attempts. It was also much more enjoyable, however with all the stone it was impossible to take the view off of our feet for most of the hike. The benefit was that when we could, there was almost always something worth attempting to capture in a mere picture.One view I was able to capture quite nicely was the High Point Shelter. The shelter itself is shown over a small stream with a foot bridge built to cross over the running water. To complete this view, we are there in the fall where the leaves are changing to multiple different colors, making this a picture out of a magazine.I put together a collage for the sites we were able to enjoy while on this particular hike (I will post the pictures when I figure out HOW!). It was fascinating to see the same items for the second time and to view them now with the change of season and many more miles under my belt. The tower felt taller, the hike easier, and the views even more spectacular.When we reached High Point Shelter we stopped at the picnic table for a snack. During that time we pulled out the shelter log and read through some of the most recent entries. It looked like someone had stayed just the night before. We also entered our own journal entry, and that’s when the trail names came up again. I asked John what names we should sign, and we decided that Tortoise and Snail were perfect names and that they would stick. I left a few minutes later still laughing.This hike was short, but it was nice to complete this part before moving onto the next section for the day, where we covered another 3.5 miles (next entry). In this short distance we got to see the morning fog on the Delaware River, the High Point Monument, and the High Point Shelter. We fully decided on trail names. It was a great way to start the morning.","High Point Monument, NJ

We again left Snail’s car there and took my car up to Sunrise Mountain Rd, where we started our second hike.It was noon when we got to the parking area to start this adventure, so we sat down at the picnic table overlooking the view on the lower side of Sunrise Mountain where the A.T. met the parking lot and enjoyed lunch before starting again. It was warming up but still felt like a fall day. The sun was shining and you could have picked out shapes in the few clouds in the sky. It was the perfect day for a hike, at least in my eyes!After lunch we started on the trail. Throughout the summer I have read some other journals from hikers completing the trail and one thing is a consistent remark. New Jersey is very… rocky. Snail and I joked again how we could not possibly loose the trail here as it looks like an old river that is all dried up. The whole trail is made of uneven stones, rocks, and boulders, with a small amount of grass and dirt in between. Most of this hike we found ourselves looking directly at our feet. To look up inevitably meant tripping over one of the upturned stones in the ground. That meant most of this part of the hike was, well, kind of boring. This was the case for most of the trail, at least for the first two miles or so.The final mile was where it became much more interesting. We found ourselves walking across boulders buried in the ground, the edges peaking through for us to walk on. It was fascinating to see how the terrain was so different from anything else we had passed in this area so far. It made me curious to see more and more of the trail, as each day we’ve been on it so far has been so vastly different. I took some videos with my GoPro and uploaded them to YouTube. The following link will bring you to my YouTube page:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXDUUoo9_X42qDMByfpWgtwBy time the boulders ended we found ourselves almost immediately coming to the Mashipacong Shelter. At first view it looked like someone might have been there. Upon closer inspection we found that it just looked as such because someone had left behind two pairs of sunglasses, and there was a blue water jug on the picnic table that someone local seems to refill regularly. Here we took a break for a small snack before completing the final quarter mile to the car. Right before we left, I took one of our trash bags and filled it with garbage that had been left in the shelter. Leave No Trace — and Take more out then in, right?! Well, I have the ability to pack others trash out pretty easily, so that’s what I did.The final quarter mile passed pretty quickly, but did not disappoint in that it too was full of stones. Ending this hike was bittersweet, as I was tired… but knew it was the last one we would be taking for the year and already I wanted to go for more! Instead we headed home, eager for the spring to come quickly!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~When we got home after this hike, as I was putting my pack away my cell phone went off letting me know I had an email. When I checked it, I had gotten an email from Snail stating the following:“Laughed when I (Snail) read this, especially the last line. It’s from the hiker going SOBO from Harper’s Ferry.The trail was beautiful today, and I am just loving this terrain. It is so easy compared to anything I’ve done so far. I still miss climbing above tree line and viewing the majestic mountain ranges as far as the eye can see, but I don’t miss the hand over hand climbing. The few times I have seen big boulders or impossible looking climbs I automatically assume that is the trail because it would have been in the north.”It seemed a very fitting way to end my entries for 2015. I am looking forward to starting on the trail again in 2016! Our goal is to start late April or early May with some day hikes in preparations for a week hike in June 2016. As we finalize more plans I will be sure to post some updates! For the winter, my goals are to continue walking on my treadmill and to do some light weights. Next year I want to be in even better shape to tackle the trail!","Sunrise Mountain Rd. Parking, NJ

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520124,"Merry Christmas! Happy Holidays! I wanted to take a moment to share some of the gifts that were exchanged this year as they are excellent companions to our section hiking plans for 2016! Although my husband is not at all interested in joining in the adventure Snail and I are enjoying on the A.T. he is still very supportive of my travels. This year there were multiple presents under the tree including a knife, flashlight, headlamp, and a waterproof cellphone case! These were great additions and they were all very lightweight (such a bonus!). I can't wait to use them, I'm already itching to get out on the trail. In addition, both my parents came to the house to celebrate and exchange gifts. The most important gifts were also trail themed, the first being an old whistle my mom decked out for me. I joked about using it inside and barely blowing into it made quite a sound. I think the whistle will be able to be heard for hundreds of miles of you blow in it hard enough! Hopefully that would never be necessary... it hurt my ears just joking around with it.The next gift was the one I gave to Snail. We had been discussing which books to purchase regarding the trail. I had purchased :: previously, but it only covers certain sections of the AT at a time. Snail had talked about purchasing ""The AT Guide"" by David ""Awol"" Miller in loose leaf format for easy access to copying the pages before each trip. Because of the nature of our hiking, I got us both copies of the northbound & southbound versions. They are perfect for our needs.The final gift that was given was the present from Snail to me. I had been interested in a map of the A.T. to track what I have hiked. I do not have the time or ability to do a thru-hike, but to see what I've actually covered is really exciting and makes me want to hike the following year even more! That is the picture that is posted on this entry. Snail built the frame from scratch and put plexi-glass in to be written on. I started with a permanent marker for the section completed. If you look really hard at the point where NJ meets NY you can see the 1.7% we've finished so far!I probably shouldn't go on and on and on, but I will mention one other thing. As we are <-> this close to 2016, I have decided on some resolutions to try to better ready myself for hiking this year. The first is that I am doing a 1000 mile challenge to walk 1000 miles over this next year starting Jan 1, 2016. This will get me off the couch and moving before spring! The other is to go to REI during my vacation in January to see what other items would benefit our hiking. So far my list is new hiking shoes, pants, and a full set of hiking poles. I'm sure the list will multiply as time goes on.But for now, until next time...",,Christmas Presents 2015,"Dec 26, Sat",0

We had a shopping list of items we were looking for, and of course left with a few other items as well! Shopping at REI is like others shopping in Wal-Mart.

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521614,"Today Snail and I decided to take a trip down to the Delaware Water Gap with the mission of discovering where we will be parking our vehicles for the next overnight section hike we complete in June. We are planning a 2 day adventure between Totts Gap Road and the exit point right next to the Mohican Outdoor Center. According to google maps this will be 14.2 miles. The longest we have hiked in a day is around 6 miles, but we are working to build up to around 10-12 miles per day. (Reminder: Our names are Tortoise and Snail for a VERY good reason!) This hike will be the precursor to our six day hike two weeks following, and it will give us a general idea of how far we can really go in one day. It will also be our first multi-overnight trip. We located the parking area off of Totts Gap Road, PA first. This parking area is large enough to hold 3-4 cars and sits at the bottom of an access road 0.25 miles from the A.T. It was turning out to be a nice day, so we decided to take a short walk to the trail just to make sure we knew where we were going. Let me tell you, it felt great to get back out for a walk again, and technically we covered about 20 whole feet of the trail! It was quite icy in spots getting up to the trail, and we had other missions to complete, so we only stayed for a few moments before heading back to the car to find the next spot!The next stop we made was near the Mohican Outdoor Center (MOC), NJ. There is parking at the MOC which we will utilize when we actually complete this hike, but we just pulled off to the side of the road for the time being. That is where we covered about 100ft of the trail just to say we were on it for the first time in 2016. Already I am antsy to get started again, and excited to use all the new gear we have picked up.Speaking of gear... since we were not too far from the REI we first went to when we were starting to pick up our gear, we took a trip back there to pick up some final items we need for our overnight stays. Again, this is what I came home with:1. Darn Tough Daphne Light Hike Quarter Socks - Women's - L/G2. Buff UV Half Buff3. Trekking Pole Walking Tips4. Sea to Summit Silk Stretch Mummy Liner5. Osprey Aura 65 AG Pack - Women's6. Mountain House Meals (4)Although I have a pack, I found it was too large, and it caused bruises on my upper chest as well as where my shoulders rotate. I didn't go planning on buying a pack, but I had seen the Aura 65 online with high reviews so I figured I would check it out. I also spoke with a rep in REI who was very helpful answering all the questions Snail and I had. I will admit freely, she said if I put the pack on that I would end up leaving the store with it and she was right! In the store she packed the bag with 15 pounds of weight but when the pack was on it barely felt like it was filled with anything. I can see why it is considered anti-gravity and I am looking forward to using it it out on the trail.Okay, I've gone on with my excitement enough. Tomorrow we are talking a walk around Nicholson, including seeing some pretty awesome views of the Tunkhannock Viaduct. Until next time...","Totts Gap Road, PA

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521618,"As I said two days ago, yesterday Snail and I took a walk around Nicholson, PA. Snail planned a 6+ mile walk for us to see how we are doing in our training for starting Spring hikes on the A.T. We managed to finish 6.22 miles in 3 hours 16 minutes. We completed a total elevation of 370ft and at least half of the path was not flat or easily walked. The picture attached is from the highest point looking down on the town. It was pretty awesome! I haven't taken a walk to this particular place for over 10 years and it was really cool to go back and to see the views! Thank goodness I'm not afraid of heights!Okay... until next time!",,Tunkhannock Viaduct,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523752,"Weather hitting 75 degrees in early March in Pennsylvania and New Jersey is amazing, and not something to waste when you happen to be free from work obligations for those days! Snail and I got a later start than we usually prefer because I had to go into work for about an hour before getting on the road. That got us started almost three hours later than we originally planned, but we were still able to accomplish the section we were hoping to in good time.This section included parking at a lot about a quarter mile below the trail, where we had to climb up an access road... and I swear that was actually the hardest part of this hike! My lungs are not a huge fan of uphill, but they better shape up! Compared to that straight uphill that doesn't even count towards the trail mileage, the rest of the hike was filled with great views and more manageable foot steps. I found myself looking up much more, able to enjoy the views!Speaking of views, seeing the Indian Head was very nifty! And some of the mountain ranges far in the distance are beautiful, even without leaves as it is still too early for the buds to blossom.This section also taught me that I am still afraid of the ground moving beneath me. I used to joke that I am happy to keep my feet solid on the ground, or to at least feel like I am on solid ground, but I realized when crossing the bridge to the visitors center that I am still very anxious when it comes to the insecure feeling of the bridge moving under my feet. Every time a big truck would go by us, my legs felt wobbly and I just kept wanting to get across as fast as possible. Guess I'm going to have to work on that. One of the reasons I am doing this is to conquer my fears. This one needs work.To date, completing this section finished the longest stretch we have completed in one day. That was an accomplishment, but we are hoping to beat this distance multiple more times over 2016. Well, I will be getting up early and heading back out tomorrow with Snail to complete another section. Until next time...","Totts Gap Road, PA

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523755,"I forgot to mention yesterday that Snail and I took our packs with us yesterday and today to get used to the weight of them and to adjust as necessary. My pack is weighing around 28 pounds and is basically fully packed. There are still some adjustments I am looking to make which should keep my pack around 30 pounds by time I'm ready to go on our longer hike in June. The first pack I bought made this weight almost impossible, but yesterday and today's hike I could barely tell I had the pack on. Apparently this is the right pack for me and I'm glad I decided to invest in it!We headed back up to the southern most part we completed in 2015, Sunrise Mountain Road. This time we continued south to Culvers Gap. So, we thought this was going to have a small section that went uphill followed by a steady walk down. That was not the case and soon became a joke among us every time we saw a slight incline in front of us. It still wasn't as bad as the access road yesterday! (Yes, I'm still comparing everything to that... I shouldn't have to work that hard BEFORE I get to the trail! Just saying!)Today's hike consisted of some marvelous views particularly at the pavilion and the fire tower. Between the two we stopped to have lunch at the Gren Anderson shelter and met a gentleman who helps to maintain that shelter while enjoying the beautiful days like today. We got to talking and he was telling stories about the boy scout troop he brings camping and stories that go along with parts of the trail he's hiked. It was a very nice chat! Lunch consisted of peanut butter filled wraps and dried clementines. We are testing out meals to bring with us on our week long trip!By time we got to the decline down to Culvers Gap parking lot we were slowing down. In two days we completed almost 12 miles and we were feeling it. I can say, I need to get moving more at home and focus on increasing my mileage if I want to make it as far as we would like to go later this year! Better get my butt moving!!! Right now, the next planned day on the trail is April 17th. If Snail and I can work out a day or two in between we will be going out earlier (I hope so!).

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525125,"Last post I stated that it was the furthest hike we had completed on the AT to date. Well, we overtook that distance and today (three days later) my calves are still sore! I have some work to do as far as getting into shape enough to do the multi-day hike in June and still be able to walk at the end of it!Snail and I enjoyed another lovely day in March on the AT. We started at the bridge facing south near the Mohican Center. The morning consisted of a brisk breeze and bright sunlight, and a deceiving amount of rocks! The first 4.5 miles to the top of the summit was a pretty easy walk in comparison to the second half of this hike, especially after taking a snack break to enjoy the spectacular view. Today, hands down, held the best view we have seen to date. It was almost a full 360 degree view which included the Delaware River, the mountain ranges we had just hiked, and miles of views all the way around. I was in awe. After enjoying the view for quite a while, we continued on the trail toward Sunfish Pond. I have one word - Rocky. There was definitely a balance between enjoying the surroundings and watching the ground for each step. Being careful did not stop the klutz that I am, and I found myself stumbling on some uneven rocks and finally falling to my knees. It could have been so much worse, only resulting in a few bruises on my shins and knees. Of course, we continued on!The hardest part was going on the AT side of the Sunfish Pond, which also starts my amusing story of why we will eternally have our names, Snail and Tortoise. About half way around the pond, we passed what seemed to be a father/son who decided to go fishing with their dog. As we roughed over the uneven stone we spoke for a few moments with them, joking about how nice the day had become and wishing them luck on the fishing endeavor. Snail and I then continued on our way, slowly making it over to the other side of the pond. It was a relief to see that the trail followed an old access road and evened out for a while after, giving our feet and legs a nice break. That is when the passing of other hikers began! First was a group of eight hikers who had enjoying the other side of the Sunfish Pond and were on their way back to the same parking lot we were headed. *8 people* We continued to walk almost directly behind them until we got to campground #2, where we stopped to enjoy lunch. Swiss cheese, meat sticks, hard boiled eggs, and a clif bar was the menu of choice. Three miles remained and we were slowing down but still moving. As we got back on the trail, three more day hikers and a dog passed us. We chatted for a few moments regarding the best path to take at a split, each chose the AT. *11 people, 1 dog* It was less than a mile up the path before the group came that made me laugh about the 'speed' of our hiking - the father, son, and dog! *14 people, 2 dogs* We finished our hike and it was awesome. I already cannot wait until our next one!Until next time...","Mohican Outdoor Center, NJ

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529840,"4/16-4/17/2016 - This was the first overnight hike Snail and I completed in 2016, and the first hike where we used our tent! This was also the most physically challenging portion of the trail for me so far. I am terrified of open heights. I do not have the best balance, my arm strength is pathetic, and I am a larger girl. These things do not mix with trying to shimmy across and over rocks that barely have enough of a place to grip, let alone to try and pull myself up with a thirty pound pack on my back. That being said... I DID IT! I am finding that I am braver than I thought I was, and more mentally strong than I originally gave myself credit for. And for all the physical challenges, the views simply could not be captured in a photograph, though of course I tried! The most stunning view was that of Manhattan across the skyline while we were sitting on top of Prospect Rock, just after crossing from New Jersey into New York.We hiked clear up to around 6:30pm, before realizing we would loose sunlight before we found another place to set up camp. With the sun quickly disappearing, and both of us fading quickly... tired from the tedious climbing and hiking we had championed through the vertical rocks to get to the campsite we found. We even climbed a ladder built into the rock face! Snail was extremely tired, and once the tent was set up, he had a stick of meat and cheese, then laid down. I stayed up a while longer, famished, and cooked myself a meal I dehydrated before setting out on our two day adventure. The meal included dehydrated hamburger, tomatoes, bell peppers, and tomato sauce with couscous and spices. It tasted like spaghetti!After dinner, I hung UP the bear bin, not realizing it was okay to set it at the base of a tree... Instead I tied it into a split tree with two trunks! It was amusing, to say the least, when Snail woke up in the morning and just laughed at my macguiver-esk attempt at protecting our food! Speaking of morning, we were both awake on and off from 6am on, however it was COLD, so we stayed in the tent a while longer, allowing the sun to make it up over the trees. Around 8:30am we started to move around, making ourselves breakfast and trying one of the Mountain House Scrambled Egg meals. It was as expected for a freeze dried meal, but could definitely have been worse. Then, we broke down the tent and set off to finish our hike.The end of the hike was half a block from a Creamery. Of course we stopped for ice cream before heading back home! During the previous two days of hiking, every person we passed explained how good the ice cream was at this location. It held up to the reviews! It was also fascinating to find out that the High Point Tower could be seen from the picnic tables outside the Creamery. To see how many miles were between that tower in the far off distance and where we were currently sitting put in perspective how far we have already gone... and how much further the WHOLE AT has left to go!Okay, well, until next time...","Wawayanda State Park, NJ

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538484,"The map I got for Christmas is slowly highlighted as we complete different sections of the trail. This particular adventure completed the final piece we needed in order to put New Jersey behind us! We got a later start 6/8/16, but still managed to clear 5.5 miles before finding a place on the side of the trail to set up the tent for the night. After raining all morning before we headed out on the trail, the sky cleared up right before we got to our starting destination so clear skies and a nice wind provided us great weather for our days hike. The most interesting aspect we passed was the Beaver Swamp, where you could see two ""houses"" that were built, and the tree stumps that were left in the wake of the houses being constructed. The other part of the first days hike that really caught my interest were all these little white and pink flowers that looked like icing drops before they opened to bloom. The last piece of interest on the first day was that we passed the lake where ""Friday the 13th"" was filmed! Of course I had to take a picture! Being as much of a movie fan as I am, it was fascinating to me for sure.The second day was a day of many firsts for Snail and I, the biggest being that it was the first day we both woke up and fell asleep on the trail in our tent. We cleared 8.5 miles on 6/9/15, and that took us all day! I keep saying, we earn our names, Snail and Tortoise, however we are out there and that is more than most can say! And I personally do not mind the slower pace. I feel like I can really soak in all that is going on around me and all the interesting views. I will say though, one thing in particular happened on the second day while I was taking pictures that I was not expecting... The picture captured a double rainbow that I did not see until I reviewed the pictures I had taken later at home. I posted it to show on this post! We finished day 2 at Brink Shelter, but decided to tent instead of staying in the shelter. We did utilize the Privy and the table, while checking out the shelter - impressed by the newness of it and how well put together it was.The third day, 6/10/16, we completed the final stretch of our hike, completing around 4 miles. We got a very late start after chatting with so many of the hikers who stayed at she shelter the night before. Once we got started, we found that there was a check in box that had many of the hikers that were at the shelter the night before, including Jester and Wonderland (thru-hikers from GA); Birch & Grateful (Flip-Flop); and Huck & Fin (section hikers). It was fascinating to catch up with some of those who have been on the trail for over a month to see how their adventures are going. One girl at the shelter had gotten in late the night before after doing twenty-five miles! I cannot even think about that many... I'll be impressed when/if we pass 10!!It surprised me how quickly the four miles went on the final day, and I found that I could have continued for a while after we completed. That made me think if we had the ability to escape to the trail for a longer period of time, maybe we would have some longer days. I guess we will find out, as next week we will be on the trail in NY for 6 days. Before then, however, I have an announcement:WE, TORTOISE AND SNAIL, HAVE FINISHED NEW JERSEY!

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539580,"We may not be fast, but Snail and I definitely embrace the mantra, “Hike your own hike.” Two minutes into our hopeful six-day journey, I stupidly tripped over my own feet and scraped my knee. Now that the first injury is out of the way, up up up we went! Throughout the journey today there were many mountains, sadly I do not remember any downs. Where there any?! The benefit to the inclines were the views, which were amazing! I realized how much I appreciate walking through the mountain laurel, and how beautiful it looks when you can see all that you walked through. We hiked through to the Fingerboard Shelter, where we arrived around 3pm. As we hiked in, we realized just how many people were already camping around the shelter but Snail and I both needed to take a break, so we found a location and put our stuff down to take a nap. Around 5pm we got back up and decided to try to find the water source, unfortunately we found it had dried up and was no longer an option. Realizing how much daylight we had left in the day, and how many people were at the campsite already, we ventured on for a few hours.To end the day, we finally came down a small incline, where we saw a deer! I was expecting it to run as we got closer, but it was fearless and continued to eat no matter how much noise we were making! At the bottom of the incline, which turned out to be around one-tenth of a mile away from Woods road, we camped for the night. The deer hung around until dusk turned dark! It was really neat to watch her go about her merry business. When we set the tent up, the temperature was warm, and the breeze was comforting. We decided not to put on the rain cover, and just used the bug net to sleep in. That was another new experience! Snail was quite tired after the days’ hike, where I was still wired for sound. I have been hiking with the Grandma Gatewood book, so I read a good chunk of the book before the sun slept on the other side of the mountain, making a flashlight necessary. At that time, I decided it was time to sleep, excited for our next day’s adventures!","AT on Arden Valley Rd

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539581,"We thought we started early today, getting on the trail at 8:20am. Today was tricky as we were basically out of water leaving camp, and we had to go 1.5 miles to get to the next water source. This doesn’t sound challenging to the normal backpacker, but that could be a quarter of our full days hike, which turns into hours before water would be available to us! Luckily, we were okay – we downed a whole 2L bottle of water when we arrived at the water source! We realized the water sources in this area of the AT were too spread out for the regular water bottles we carry, but I had a two gallon container with me and filled that half way as well. Boy, the extra weight was difficult, especially up some of the mountains, but it was worth it. We used every last drop! Have I mentioned yet that it was hot?!Around noon Snail and I rested at the William Brien Memorial Shelter, where we met a thru-hiker by the name of Farmer. He told us some stories about his NOBO thru-hike, and through the stories I am amazed at the hospitality of others along the trail! After the worst of the afternoon heat subsided, we ventured on, seeking the next water spot where we were to camp for the night. Half way there, after another arduous climb, the heat got the better of Snail, so we stopped so he could nap and gain some strength to continue to our destination! I read and ate trail mix. Finally, we made it to the brook, where we saw Farmer and another thru-hiker also calling it a night. Once we found where we wanted to tent, the setup was quick to get camp ready for the night. We got water from the brook, made dinner and ate, then went to bed.","Campsite near Woods Road

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540645,"We woke even earlier for us, getting started before the heat crept into the air. The first section Snail and I had to tackle was a 550ft climb within a mile of terrain. To top that off, the next reliable place to replenish water is 10 miles away! We had never done 10 miles in a day with our packs, and Snail was hurting. This resulted in me almost filling the two gallon reserve I was carrying with me so that we would have enough water to stay hydrated through today's hike, as well as water for the night as we were sure we were not going to be making it that total ten miles. That caused me to be very slowed. I was not prepared to take another 16 lbs of water, I'm too out of shape for that! I did it anyway, and just took it a step at a time, slow and steady, as we've been doing since the beginning of our hike. We made it to the top, and sat to enjoy the view! It was a relief when we realized we were going down just about the same elevation but over another 1.8 miles.   It was part way down that the experience became bittersweet. Snail decided he was not able to continue our adventure and would need to be picked up at the bottom of this mountain, at Seven Lakes Drive. With this news, I contacted my mom to make the two hour drive to come pick us up. While she made her way to us, we made our way down to the parking lot off of Seven Lakes Drive.On our way to the Parking lot, we passed SciFi, a guy who was slack packing SOBO for 10 miles, but was normally going NOBO for his thru-hike. We stopped to chat with him for a few minutes, and he reminded me of the app from Guthook, which is very handy when there is little or no cellphone service and a map might be handy to see where you are in relation to where you are trying to go. He also pointed us in the right direction for the parking lot, which was a short walk down the road from the trail. We continued on to the lot, where we found a place to let Snail lay down while we were waiting for mom. While we were there, we discussed the possibility of me going on my own. The idea had me both excited and nervous at the same time! I wasn't sure I could carry all the equipment I would need, as we currently were splitting the weight of what was necessary for the hike. I packed only what was absolutely necessary in my pack and picked it up. Its very heavy, but I thought it was manageable. After more discussion, we decided I would continue. I came up with the idea of slack packing up to Perkins Memorial Tower, so that I could skip taking a pack up the 750ft climb. Snail agreed that would be a splendid idea, and said he and mom could meet me at the top with my pack. This is where Snail's adventure (this time) ended, and mine continued.","Beechy Bottom Brook

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540649,"I made sure Snail was okay. He had something to eat and I made him a Gatorade. He helped me to gather what I needed to continue on alone, including the bug spray, the map from AWOL, the bear bin he usually carried with enough food for myself for the next three days, and a general idea of where I should try to tent and the mileage for me to accomplish for the next few days. I packed up my bag in preparation for when Snail and my mom meet me at the Perkins Memorial Tower, then took one of the water bottles and my phone... and started off again!The hike up the mountain wasn't as strenuous without a pack. It was made up of what seemed like an old road, and steps made of stones. The heat made it more difficult than it needed to be, but the wind and the views part way up made it worth the climb. I made a game out of it, working to beat my parents to the top! I did win, but only because my mom got stuck in traffic on the way and was delayed almost 40 minutes! When she showed up, she brought some trail magic! An ice cold wash cloth to wash myself with and cool my face, and ice cold gatorade! I'm not always a fan, but I drank a whole bottle! It was such a treat. We took a walk around the Tower, and took some pictures together in front of a view of Bear Mountain. It was right around 1, so we decided to go to the local town to get some lunch together before I started back out on the trail. We found a deli and got hoagies. I also got a yummy side dish of pasta salad. It was a wonderful meal, enjoyed in the air conditioning of the car. It was hard to go back out in the heat, but I really wanted to continue, and if I wanted to make camp somewhere away from too much civilization I was going to need to get going. My goal was to camp somewhere on the other side of that mountain, although I went so much further! We said our good-byes and I got going.The hike down from the Memorial Tower was interesting. It was almost all steps. That's all I remember of that side of the mountain at least. Steps. I also remember that I could not find one place to camp. I also had a family of four taking a leisurely walk behind me, and felt that it just was not appropriate to stop without a definitive camping site, especially because of the little kid that was with them. This caused me to keep going all the way to the bottom, leading out to the Bear Mountain Recreational Area. Looking around I realized there was not going to be a place to camp until I started back up Bear Mountain either, so I needed to continue on. I took a quick bathroom break, utilizing the actual facilities provided, before making my way to the Zoo. I was excited to enjoy the walk through the Zoo, quickening my pace as I made my way to the gate! As I rounded the corner, my energy and excitement dwindled as I realized I was 10 minutes... I repeat, 10 minutes too late to enter the Zoo and walk through to the other side. Instead I would need to take the blue route. But where was the blue route? It took me nearly 20 minutes to locate it, as I was so excited to get to the Zoo I completely missed where it has split from the white blazes. Eventually my mind caught up with what it saw and I backtracked to where it split off. I was surprised to see the chain across where it was sectioned off, and to see how terribly it was up kept. Holy poison ivy! I'm not itchy tonight, so I'm sure I made it out without contracting any. Lucky I am, because my mom is VERY sensitive to it, I usually get my parents sensitivities to things!Once I got through the blue route, I made it across the Bear Mountain Bridge, to realize that I crossed it on the wrong side and had to cross traffic. Again, I was lucky in that there were not many cars, and the ones there were seemed to realize my trouble and let me cross! Now to find the entry back into the woods up the road, and make my assent up Bear Mountain until I find a campsite. I had not looked at my map recently, so I was unsure of how much further I had to an actual site but I knew I was becoming physically exhausted already. As I started up this mountain, I found myself stopping about every ten steps - in order to catch my breath and allow my legs to regain some strength. One hundred yards up there was a flat spot not too far in from the trail. I went so far as to go into that spot to decide if it was somewhere I wanted to say. I just was not feeling comfortable and decided not to make camp there. I still had at least two hours of daylight left, so I thought I'd continue on. That's when Patriot passed me, making his way up the mountain like it was nothing... as did Yellow and her boyfriend (I can't remember his name!). Even worse, there was this girl who went up and came down not only one time, but twice!!! She is a local who said she usually goes up three times every day but it was too humid so she wasn't going to finish the last one today. I decided if she could do that, I could at least make it to the top then find came. I took out my map and found there was a campsite 1.5 miles away and I could do it if I kept pushing. That's what I did. One foot in front of the other, breaks every 2-3 Blazes, until I finally heard voices where the campsite just had to be. Exhausted but relieved, I made it to Hemlock Springs Campsite where Patriot, Yellow, and her boyfriend had already set camp. They congratulated me on making it, and Patriot made me feel better by reminding me that hiking is a pass/fail not a graded activity. I am there, and I made it further than I intended, so I passed with flying colors!!!I quickly set up camp, remembering I had seen it might thundershower overnight. It was strange setting up the yellow tent, large enough for two, not having the second person to occupy it, but it was also strangely rewarding. I was carrying enough equipment for two people, and I made it further than I have to date! I made dinner and called home to my husband to let him know I was safe, and to Snail to let him know how far I had gotten... well, to have him tell me. I had not done the math yet to figure I made it 10 miles today! Okay, I'm exhausted and want to get an early start, so its bedtime for me. Until tomorrow...","Seven Lakes Drive

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540650,"I did not sleep the best last night, but I know I got a few hours at the very least. The wind was strong, and it rained off and on. I kept tossing and turning, trying to get my brain to slow enough to get some restful sleep. I will need to get used to being alone at night on the trail without my imagination going wild! It probably did not help that my first night was on BEAR Mountain, and all I could think about was the possibility of being visited by a bear. I think the more nights I'm out by myself, I'll calm those nerves.Anyway, I heard Patriot up nice and early, so I decided to join him for breakfast. I wasn't very hungry last night or this morning, so I split a ""Turkey Dinner"" meal I dehydrated before Snail and I had left. Lets just say its better the first time its eaten, and warm. It was filling and nutritious though, so I'll take it. As I was packing up, the rain decided to come a little harder, but I still wanted to get on the trail as early as I could to beat the heat coming today, so all my equipment got packed up wet. I was on the trail by 7am. The first half mile of the trail wasn't too bad, there was a slight incline, but it was much less than what I had just walked the day before. But that was the issue, I had basically hiked up three mountain sides yesterday and my legs and feet were very tired. I was mentally tired from the lack of sleep. This resulted in another phone call home, asking to be picked up 4.2 miles away from where I had started the day, at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center (GSLC). I still wanted to hike part of the day, but the equipment I was carrying was just too heavy for how tired I was.. it was getting dangerous to continue. My parents agreed to come get me two days earlier than planned, and I made the best of the hike I had remaining. To keep my mind occupied, I thought about what type of equipment I would prefer to have as a single hiker... when Snail is unable to join me. A smaller, lighter tent. A bear bag instead of the bear bin. My mind kept occupied as I struggled up the wet rocks and down the weed filled paths until I made it to the GSLC. There, I met Hedgehog, who was singing tunes with another thru-hiker (I'm so bad at names!). I'm pretty sure she passed us days ago, but I cannot remember exactly where. It was nice to have a chat, listen to Les Miserable, and sit until my parents picked me up.When they arrived, we decided to go back to the Zoo so that we could walk through it and see what all it has to offer. It was nice to complete a part of the actual trail I was unable to do because it had closed the day prior. By the end of this trip, I had completed more consecutive nights on the trail than I had previous, my first by myself, the most miles in one day, and I passed the 100 mile mark! I'm already looking for equipment and planning my next trip at the end of July!Until next time...","Hemlock Springs Campsite

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545225,"There was a small gap that was left during the last hike in NY so my goal was to finish the 12 miles between NY 17a and Arden Valley Rd. The last time I went myself, I was carrying equipment heavy enough for two due to Snail having to end his journey a little early. Between now and then I splurged for a single person tent and a bear bag to make my solo hikes a little easier on my back. This was the first trip to test out that new gear! As a surprise, Snail decided not only was he going to drop me off, but he also hiked the first 2.1 miles in! We got my car parked at the Arden Valley Road parking lot, then drove to the lot on NY 17a to get started. Of course we had to see if the Creamery was open before we started hiking... sadly it was not and the ice cream would have to wait until we were complete.Around 11:45am we got onto the trail. The hike started off pretty flat, with only a slight incline if you were to look at it from a distance. It was very much a leisure walk until we got to the Eastern Pinnicles, where both Snail and I found it interesting to climb and shimmy up the rocks and across the ledge. It was beautiful on the top looking over the valley below. I'm surprised on how much easier it is getting to scale the rocks on these more difficult parts... or at least I was until we got to the Cat Rocks. We got about half way up them before Snail realized he did not think he would be able to get back down the other side. We decided to take the blue route around instead, and upon looking at the other side we found we made the right choice. It didn't take long to get to the shelter, but with the heat, we were exhausted upon getting there. We both decided it was a good idea to take a nap through the hottest part of the day, and laid down in the shelter for a small nap. I slept a little while before I couldn't get my mind to stay at rest so I sat there staring up at the ceiling of the shelter. It was quite relaxing. When we finally decided to get back up, I pulled out lunch and made tuna wraps along with pepperoni and cheese sticks. It was delicious!After lunch, Snail and I searched out the water source to refill our bottles before he headed back to his car and I ventured on.","NY 17A, Bellvale, NY

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545226,"With our water bottles filled, we ventured our separate ways. When I first started hiking, I thought about the fact I was going to have to make sure to find somewhere to stop so that I did not accidentally walk all the way to the car. Very quickly, however, I realized that was NOT going to happen as it was almost 100 degrees out AND almost all the water sources were dried up. That made the day even harder to hike, even if the hike itself was not that difficult. While I was walking, I was hoping to grab some water at the waterfall. I never thought a waterfall would be dry as a bone. It was double upsetting to see that it was dry as a bone and I had to hike up right next to it. The redeeming factor are the guys from NY City that I met at the top. They were very impressed I was a female hiking alone on this hot of a day and that I was not afraid to stay the night by myself. I was surprised at how much of a confidence booster that was!Continuing on, I found the next three water sources were also dried up. I was getting hotter and more tired the further I hiked, so I found myself slowing down and looking around for a place to spend the night. My original goal was to get to the Lake, but I found myself stopping for the night at the inlet to the pond about 2 miles previous to the lake. There was a stealth campsite with great flat ground to set up the tent. With great exhaustion I found setting up camp to be a tedious task. It took nearly 45 minutes to set up my tent and hang my bear bag. Dinner was a Clif bar as I had no appetite and I did not want to waste my water on my food. I only had 1 liter of water left and it needed to last me to the next water source.By 6pm, I was in bed and basically already asleep.","Wildcat Shelter

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545227,"Overnight did not cool down and there was no wind. If I did not move at all then I was able to get comfortable enough to sleep. I was worried to take off the rain cover because the weather was calling for thundershowers. I wish they happened. It would have cooled the night down. In the morning, I was greeted by a family of raccoons up on the ridge line above my tent. It was fun to watch them before packing everything up to get the day started. I was up and around by 530am. I still only had one water bottle filled with water and I had around 5 miles until I reached my destination. Although the sun was barely awake, the humidity was relentless, so it was imperative to find water. That is where the most wonderful Trail Angels come into the story. Gallons of water were available at the next road crossing and it was such a relief to see. I hate to say I basically downed a whole gallon myself. I did not realize in 24 hours how dehydrated I allowed myself to be. I was very thankful that the water was available at the following two roads the trail crossed as well. So, thank you trail angels! It was amazing how many of the reliable water sources were dried up. But I made it! And I had the second night on the trail by myself, without getting too far into my own head. Good practice for August, where I will have a few more nights on the trail myself.","Campsite

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545230,"Snail and I got back on the trail again, but this time in PA to extend down from Totts Gap. After the difficulty the day before, I was originally up in the air about this hike, but I'm glad I did it. It was so much easier than the trail in NY over the last two days. After finishing NJ and half of NY, ""Rocksylvania"" seems no more rocky so far than what we have already accomplished mileage on. I am actually amused by how much quicker we are navigating our feet than when we had first started and I am glad to see that so far at least these boulders are no different than the ones we have already encountered. As a matter of fact, I do believe we are not going to recognize the trail if we ever actually find a flat area to walk on.

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549212,"This entry is going to be short... as to be honest, I forgot to write it!!!Snail and I had the opportunity to enjoy an overnight on the trail, so we decided to continue down ""Rocksylvania"" from Fox Gap to Wind Gap, PA. This trip we were packing as light as we could as we knew we were not passing any water sources, so any weight we had needed to be H2o. I also decided I would try my grandfathers old sleeping mat since we were only going on an overnight and it is lighter than my blow up sleeping pad. NOTE TO SELF: That weight is worth it, completely! When we stopped for the night it was not too rocky or rooty, but man, I could feel every little leaf under me! I will have to either find a way to adjust or just not worry about the extra ounces so that I can have a good nights sleep. I'm pretty sure the latter is going to win out!Unfortunately during this trip, Snail ended up hurting his foot, so hiking together is going to be on hiatus for a little while. Even more unfortunate is how difficult days off at work are becoming, so I believe this may be the last trip of 2016 for both Snail and I. That said, I am looking forward to scheduling MANY more miles next year. I had a goal to be at 200 by the end of this year but only made it to 130 due to weather and changes in our plans. Next year may seem insane, but I intend to make up some of that and hit 300! When looking back at the end of 2017, lets see how close (hopefully over!) I get!Until next time...","Fox Gap, PA

This trip was especially exciting to be because we got to walk over the Pennsylvania Turnpike!  I know it sounds funny, but I drive that turnpike quite often, and I go under the tunnel we walked over more times than I can count.  It's an amazing feeling to say ""I walked OVER that!"" every time I drive UNDER the mountain now! What's better?  I have picture proof!  If you'd like to see them, head on over to the gallery, I'm posting my photos in there as I go!  :DWe had lunch at a pretty awesome campsite that was set up.  I'm thinking it was right over where the tunnel is for the PA Turnpike, based on where we were in our hike.  That was pretty awesome.  At the campsite was a chair made of stones.  I never actually got to sit in it, Snail snagged that RIGHT up!  We enjoyed our meat and cheese sticks and trail mix while just enjoying some conversation.  It was nice and relaxing.  But then we had to keep going.  It was Easter after all and I had Easter dinner to get to!It was beautiful for most of the hike today, until the very end.  Then it decided we wanted to cool off with a really nice, humid rain.  It couldn't just hold off for the last 100 yards of our walk to the car... it had to come down in sheets!  Oh well!  It can't be nice all the time.  The next time I step on the trail is going to be my two week trip by myself up North!  I'm hoping to do around 150 miles in 14 days!  That will more than double what I have done on the trail to date!!Until next time...","Lehigh Furnace Gap, PA

Tortoise and Snail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590935,"It has been almost a year since I went on what was supposed to be an epic hike.  Instead, 4.5 miles in I slid on a wet mossy rock and found myself on my butt.  Pain shot through my knee and I wasn't sure I was going to be able to stand up.  I took a moment to compose myself, then gathered my things and looked to put weight on my right leg.  It held my weight but it didn't feel good, but it held so I took my time.  Maybe I could walk it off?  I was in the middle of the woods three hours from home with the intent to hike for almost two weeks.  I was only a few hours in.  As I continued over the next mile, some steps felt okay and some felt like my leg was going to cave.  
I did finally reach a road and contemplated calling home.  My knee was swollen and getting hard to move.  I saw a small camp area ahead and thought about staying the night to see if it would be better in the morning, but realized after walking almost a mile on the leg without a choice that it was hurt, very swollen, and would cause me more issues if I stayed.  Reluctantly I called for a ride home and waited by the road for a pick up.  I figured out shortly after I got back to my parents house that it had been dislocated (it popped back in!) and realized sadly that the best choice was to get off the trail.  
Because of a change in insurance, and the lack of a steady income I made the choice in 2017 to stay off the trail.  I needed to figure out what was going on with my knees and to rehabilitate the injury. As much as I knew it was the right decision, it was devastating.  But I'm back now and feeling better than I have in years.  I learned that my knees overextend naturally and that there are ways to strengthen them so that I can protect myself from further injury in this manner.
