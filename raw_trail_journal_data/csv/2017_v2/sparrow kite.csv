sparrow kite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547551,"Well, this is my intro of myself to you, Hi, There. I'm not very good at PC, or smart phones. So if you would please have a heart while i try to figure this stuff out, it would be helpful. On to why i typing, The AT trail, that walk of more than 7,000 steps, different states, and mostly in the forest. One of the long trails in the eastern U.S. For some reason i like long trails.Seems that the FL trail in my backyard is getting full of people, but not on the trail, you can still go weeks without seeing any other hiker,but getting tired of police thinking i'm a bum, and ready to call me crazy with the words such as ""you see the FL trail has orange blazes which i'm following"" how nice it would be to follow white ones instead. That it I'm going to follow white blazes.I don't really know how far or long that i'll do it. So for me in this time, I'll see entry #2.","

sparrow kite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547719,"Barking dogs not a nice sound unless it's your new gear.It's here! That smell like a new car smell, wouldn't last long. I'm not a UL hiker,but no reason not to replace the 20yr old stuff with lighter weight. Trying to find gear to fit me is very hard, I'm 5'1"", 150 lbs. 36"" 28"" 38"" with a 13"" torso.So i don't count on a really good fit with anything. The hardest thing for me is to find a backpack, just size out of luck. An really good thing happen,most my new gear,fits. A shout out to the people at REI for nothing there fit me, even the extra large was to small, so thanks for all the brands i couldn't wear,lead me to brands i could and got a better fit. My trusted backpack that was carry on plane size broke after 10 yrs. so i replaced it with a GG 60 crown. Next TNF Jacket that is still working, but at 2 lbs can go in to base camp stuff.So i found that EB FA jackets will replace my hard shell. That leaves just my trusted Therm a rest trail lite, self inflate, the foam bit the dust. replaced with the new one without the foam, and it was great that my hips didn't max out to the floor like the others i tried.I would like to thank Mountain Hardwear for they're light gear that has some thought behind how you layer clothes.Going to spend the next 4 months getting that new spell out of them.","

sparrow kite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547845,"Many friends are asking Why hike it you done it before,1978,was young love of hiking, in 2007 it was life changes, so i don't answer them with the truth,it will make us all start tearing up, i just tell them it's what i like to do. In truth this hike is for my mother, I'll be taking her with me.When i was younger she said she never worried about me in the woods, wild, places.Some how she knew that the sound of birds, the feeling of wind was like a uplifting for my soul,feeding me in ways. So i'm writing this for those times when i'll think about quitting, to let myself know she didn't give up on me.That is the reason to go cause now she can share my hiking where her health won't allow her to join me except in thoughts before.","

sparrow kite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548205,"Really happy just got a ok to hike from my all my doctors, great.Besides hiking for my mom,i really think it will help me get into shape both in body and mind. Thinking it's going to be hard really hard for me in the first weeks, the doctors plan is not working, in the weight loss. In 3 months i have only drop 5 lbs. Just one of few that don't respond well. So 3 months of 1cup of oatmeal, lunch of greens, 1 1/2 cup, and 3oz of meat with yams for dinner. about 800 cal. also 1 hr of training. Most people would have lost 10 to 20 on that. Like most things in my life i have to work twice as hard.So if you see me huffy on the hills and going slow please keep those ""drop weight first,blah blah"" to your self. For unless your body responds like mine, your not able to understand like the doctor said ""it should be working"". On to nicer things, My new gear works went out in the storm to test my rain jacket, work in drizzle and the downpours with high winds.thanks herrmie. my pack fits great, and feels like it isn't there. Got 4 more months before leaving so another 5 lbs off me.See you on the trail.","

sparrow kite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552208,"Wow , Wow Wild fires every where, So sorry for those who lost their homes. I'm just months away from being there.Seeing those sights of fire, the dust of ash. My prayers have been to the heart of those who fight and help fight the wildfires. This is not going to be a pleasant thing to see, but i'm going anyway. I'm not walking just for the green tunnel, and the sights. I really don't know if shelters have burned, or if the trail will be passable.It matters not so much. I'll have to bring maps now. I'll take to the woods, what ever they give me. just really plan on carry extra water.as such and walk the long way around.","

sparrow kite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552882,"About 6 week to go, everyone wants to join me, It's been 1 of those years where some time off just sounds good, just walking in the woods, peace and time to think. Planing on a very strange trip. With the lack of water and dry springs, then the undergrowth be burned, the warmer temps, and all the new trail places rerouted since my last hike. So now all that's left to do is just to do it. I can't say i'll never say what was i thinking this is harder,My shoulder is getting better.so my feet. Do i know how to hike up hills? There's a hill?? by my house it's 9ft high at a 3% incline for 1/16 of a mile.A neighbor asked if i was OK, i was doing lunges up and down that hill?? my reply was yes i'm fine just pretending it's a big hill. Now all my hood thinks i'm crazy. So a AT trip sounds peaceful,restful,and not as crazy as backpacking around the neighborhood.","

sparrow kite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554684,"It just a waiting game now. Have i added to my gear well yes, heavy jacket. I hope that it will fit the carry on size, close to it. Frist 3 mail drops are sending out on Monday.Got the gear dial down, and since i'm not a ul it's 15 lb.base. about 20 all. Well i guess i like a set of clean dry clothes for the night. and my music, since i'm older, comfort, is more up on my list than speed.There are things i double up. warm jackets for 1, 1 for hiking 1 for camp.and i pick up a day sack. for carrying water up those big hills. plus it makes a good washing bag.Still use my fork, just how do you eat pasta with a spoon? Many people are starting about the same time as i, be fun to see them going past me. Since side effects on meds cause me to be flat on my back for a month, all that prep has been lost.","

sparrow kite,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554814,"OK, just checked some you tube for 2017 hike, Guess what i saw, bridges over most those creeks we had to ford, steps at places we had to climb on roots, no wonder they are doing 15 and more, they don't have to stop to put on dry socks, or pull peeps up the 3 ft. roots. I guess the trail has been has been redone for hiking, It looks like it's no longer the goat path, i'm used to. the one you stare at the 6ft. by 4 ft. mud hole and just slash though.the reason it 4ft is other chose to go around. i saw side by side places to walk also. and proper tent sites. Do these peeps know how lucky they are? Are they giving thanks to the hike club who worked so hard to make it easy on them. What other wonders, will i find? I remember in Harrisburg, picking up a harness, cause the trail was iffy in some PA, and NY places. not to go over those cliffs.I'll keep you posted if the goat path i love has turn into,a two lane trail, and lost some of those ""how in the ? Noooo Wayyyy! Scary too Scary walking.  A BIG THANK YOU TRAIL CLUBS, WORKERS, FOR YOUR TIME AND SKILL.shout out. if i don't see ya.","
