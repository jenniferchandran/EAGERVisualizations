Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469310,Texas Tornado is my trail name......when I thought about hiking the AT Trail and started reading about needing a trail name ...thought I better name myself because I would be afraid of what the trail would name me....I can see it now I would have gotten the name.....FATTY or maybe POOR THING....just to name a few.....well after so thought I came up with .... ( Texas Tornado ) .... because I live in Texas and my life medically anyway was a tornado....,,View Entry,"Jun 13, Mon",0
Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471884,As you all know I didn't choose a photo of myself like most everyone else did....I just really like the little sign that says ( This is my story ) there was just somethimg about it.....I have thought about adding a personal photo but I've yet to do so.....I got to thinking that maybe some of you might would like to see what I look like.......mind you I'm nothing to look at or I don't have a face that just sticks in your mind but its my face and I've grown accustomed to it......well anyway if you wanted to know this is me.....until next time.......TexasTornado,,View Entry,"Jun 14, Tue",0
Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442728,Well I purchased a version phone through straight talk....I have read many journals and plus I called many places on the AT trail and there was a few At&t a few T mobile but Verizon was hands down on the trail.....so Verison it is...,,View Entry,"Jun 15, Wed",0
Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/469211,"I made this small pocket stove..
I found the directions on U tube its just perfect for me it does everything I need it to.... it is a alcohol stove... it weighs 3 oz..including the pot.....fits in my pocket...holds one cup water.....I put it next to my old stove to show the difference....I loved my old stove but it but it's way to big... plus I only use my pot to boil water ....",,View Entry,"Jun 16, Thu",0
Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539201,I have been refining my backpack for awhile now ...I know there is still so much I need to change to keep the weight down..... I received my tent but I still need to seam seal it.... it is the double rainbow by Henry shires...it's a single wall so condensation can be a issue from what I read.... I like that it has a single pole and can be made free standing.... and it's less than 2 pounds... it's definitely roomy inside....I do have a issue with it there's a bar on the top to keep the material from sagging I think it's called a spreader bar.... anyway I have to take it off and store it on the outside of my pack.... it's hard to put on since you have to weave it in and out of this little thing I need to modify it so it can clip in... if not I may have to come up with a different tent ....,,View Entry,"Jun 19, Sun",0
Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545357,"I have been packing and unpacking this pack no lie at least 100 times maybe more I'm ashamed to say.. I'm trying to get my weight down to a comfortable fill.. It has been a chore...some of you may know I started the AT Trail Feb.27,2014....I hiked only 250 plus miles....why did I quit you ask... lets just say I was far from being ready..... the first thing was I had 6 surgeries in 1 year and 1 month with the last surgery being December 5, 2013....there are a few things I learned out there.. one I started with a 35-40 pound pack and I relized I didnt like it.......so this time around I'm going to try the total opposite.....now after many days of packing and unpacking and changing 90 percent of my pack I'm finally down to 15- 17 pounds that includes 3-4days of food but with out water or what I will be wearing and plus I'm carrying a small shoulder bag that holds my glasses and sunglasses mini sawyer and map and a few other things.... however I'm not 100% sure I will be carrying it so that weight has to go somewhere.... I am thrilled the pack fills so much better.....however I did have to give up some comforts OK alot of comforts.....but it doesn't pull down my shoulders and cut into them also I can lift my pack with ease not like last time having to break my back or throw my shoulders out just to get it on my back and always dreading taking it off and putting it back on...so now I need to take it out for a test....in 10 days I'm going to New Mexico where the altitude is 9,000 to 12,500 not like where I live with altitude of around 1,700 here in West Texas....I am going for 2 weeks doing around 80 miles .... its cold at nights already that high up plus there in there rainy season with rain everyday....so with A 30 degree bag and a single wall tent we shall see how it goes.......,",,View Entry,"Aug 11, Thu",0
Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547035,"Heading to New Mexico in the morning for 7 days to test my new light weight set up I'm hoping to use. The weather condition where I'm going is close to the condition of Georgia in March.the altitude is 9,000 to12,500 it is there rainy season so it will be raining every day and night and every thing in-between...it will be a good test for my new equipment especially my double rainbow I'm worried about it being a single wall and of course my seam sealing skill...after I'm done there I'm heading to Colorado for a week where the condition is the same butttttttttt it's colder instead of 40 for the low it will be around 25 and I need that to test my 32 degree bag with my liner and emeg. SOL bag if needed. I'm really excited I will let you know how it goes ....wish me luck.....","

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548787,"Made it back from my trip to New Mexico and Colorado...I was there trying out my gear for the AT Trail..the day I got there it was pouring rain a all out gully washer... it rained for the first 5 days ... you know I choose New Mexico and Colorado because it's their rainy season and it's cold at nights in the mountains I was at 9,500 ft.to 13,500 ft... on Day 1 we got a late start it was about 11:30 am because we had to stash water since there is no water on this whole trail for 32 miles.. it was raining and cold I could see my breath it was about 45 degree...I was hiking with someone who had walked this portion of the trail before... we were going to just hike 5.5 mile the first day but this person messed up and we walked 12 miles in cold rain that is what I get for not looking at the map and trusting someone else... my cuben fiber poncho keep me dry except for my arms and legs of course...plus it kept me warm considering I didn't have a jacket on just light weight baselayer top and bottom and shorts and polyester tee shirt....my feet held up no problems there I used wool toe socks only....normally I was wear darn tough socks but I've had issues with blisters so I decided on toe socks they definitely worked ... since it kept pouring and heavy lightening we decided to get off the mountain and go back down the mountain dry out and try and find another area that wasn't so harsh ... we did find a place it did rain everyday though but not as bad and no lightening we hiked around 6 mile days but ended up car camping .. I used my 2 person double rainbow.. tried using it as a free standing with my hiking poles but it didn't work so well it was probably me and not the tent.... it held back the rain and wind but I did have trouble trying to put it up in the wind since you have to put the pole in first before you can mount it to the ground.... I need to finish dinner right now ...I tell you more later about the rest of my trip and equipment....","

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548866,OK more about my trip to New Mexico and Colorado.... I was talking about my tent the Henry Shires Double rainbow about it was hard controlling the material while putting the pole through the sleeve....the wind was blowing the tent all around...when I got a second pair of hands to help me out it was a breeze to put up....but out on the trail its only me putting it up......it has made me rethink this tent for me...so sad because I once again will be looking at different tent... I do like the design of z packs tents like the hexamid 1person I think that's what you call it or its the soloplex.....but it sure has a hefty price to go with it..... next I'll talk about my water filter.... OK I got the sawyer mini and everyone seems to love it... but I don't know if I will use it...I preferred the platypus water filter one sweet system no doubt about it..... I'll write more tomorrow about my trip.,"

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549067,More about my trip to Colorado and New Mexico...I was talking about my water filter....I got a mini sawyer for Christmas and I wanted to see this wonderful thing in progress that everyone is so crazy about.... well I guess I don't know how to use it or maybe I expected more from it.... for me it was way to slow and it has to many quarks ....like when you put it directly onto a bottle and try and drink that way the bottle collapsed....also it takes so long to squeeze water from a bag to a clean bottle or bag ...... and plus to back filter takes alot of time ....I think I have to say no...and that's a big no... I will stay with my platypus gravity works that to me is just right for me....it has its disadvantage like it's big and bulky plus it weighs a pound ....... you know no matter what it is that I will be using on the trail has its advantages and disadvantages also it's just what works best for me.... what works for me may not work for you..... I'll write more soon....,"

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549138,So more about my trip to New Mexico and Colorado.... well I talked about my tent the double rainbow and the cuben fiber poncho and my toe socks and my water filter....I do want to say one last time before I move on that they had there good points and there not so good points so I will have to really think on it if the good out weighs the not so good in order for me to keep them...my homemade alcohol stove worked ok its not the one on my list which I will tell you about another time...but I am going to change my pot to something else since I had no handle and I can tell I really didn't like that..... so I still need to dial that in also plus do I need a wind screen too who knows... really who knows I have read read read and I have bought bought bought my share of equipment and find that I don't like something about them all yet they have great things I do like so I am going to have to write down on a piece of paper the name of the equipment and on one side write all the good things and on the other side write the bad things.... and if the good has more good things than the bad then I need to keep it because I can't afford to keep buying buying buying....talk to you later,"

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551536,In my last entry I talked about my equipment... there was things I liked and disliked about them....I did decide to change my 30 degree down bag to a 10 degree Down Revelation Quilt from EE Equipment......it's a much better quilt.....I will add a picture to my gear section soon...I got the quilt from their Garage sell section it was cheaper and I ordered it on Monday and received it on Saturday... it was perfect.... I have decided to change tents right now I have a double rainbow love a lot of things about it and almost decided to get a single rainbow butttttttttt I can save a lot of weight by getting the solo tent made by six moon design Luna solo weight of 24 Oz compared to double rainbow being 42 Oz. I haven't ordered it yet becauseeeee I just can't decide if I want the single rainbow it's still 10 oz heavier than the single six moon design Luna solo .....I also changed base layers I went from Patagonia straight polyester to omni tech merino wool blend with polyester I got light weight pair and mid weight pair... I really like them I will change them to the Patagonia brand when summer rolls around think I made a better choice....as for my water filter I decided to go with sawyer butttttttttt not the mini and make a few modifications to suit my needs.... changed my whole kitchen set which is home made I will add a pic soon..... still working on a few other things will let you know about that later...... I have a question for everyone what do you think about the fires in Georgia Tennessee Virginia.....I heard the trail from around mile 67 to mile 160 is closed... I wonder if the trail will be closed next spring...... I still need to get my ticket and make my reservation....what do guys think....,"

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551968,"Less than 90 days to get everything done....I can't believe 1 week ago I went to set down on the couch and something happened to my knee I am having problems with bending and it fills tight.....still having problems.... how ever with some good news I purchased a revelation quilt a 10 degree from EE Equipment I really like it.... today I ordered a new tent company is six moon design called the lunar solo.... they said they are running behind so maybe 2 weeks before they get it out maybe longer..... now the bad news I need to start thinking about a stove replacement mine is a homemade alcohol kind and as far as I know they are banned.....I really don't know anything about the canister kind 
I'm afraid I won't be able to prime it right heck I don't know if all canister stoves have to be primed any one with a suggestion.... Texas Tornado","

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552082,I've been reading a lot of your journals and looks like everyone is ready to go......I'm almost done just making a few last minute changes.....I haven't made my reservation yet or purchased my ticket yet because I just don't know about the trail closures.... there are several still out there and time is ticking away.... I don't have anyone to pick me up and drop me off in these spots and shuttle service would be out of my price range to be shuttled every week or two........I guess I could Start further down the trail and come back in the end if need be.....I sure didn't want to really travel totally along ....I could start in the middle but I really don't like that because I really would be walking by myself in the end ...... also what stoves is everyone using I guess I need to get one of the canister kind it don't need to simmer and the simpler the better.... what are all you guys doing a bout the trail closures...

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553786,It's been so long since I've updated my journal....The truth is that I've been so down in the dumps....You see I hurt my knee pretty bad in November it became swollen the instant I hurt it... I waited 3 weeks before seeing a doctor....By then it was locking up and felt so unstable....A MRI was ordered and of course it wasn't good...I had 2 tears in the outter meniscus one very large and tore 10% of my ACL and it's bowed also.... With the holidays rolling around the knee doctor gave me a shot and a hinged brace and said give it 2 weeks and we'll see you then.....Well 2 weeks went by and nothing.... So he decided to send me to a surgeon and the surgeon said he could do a clean up kind of surgery .... That was set for just this Tuesday.....I set it up and went for my release test to say it was OK like EKG a physical and so on.... But I called and cancelled because I read so many negative things.... My knee is still sore but not locking but does fill weak but not unstable......I have been walking every day but for only 1 mile a day by then my outside of knee becomes totally numb....... I am so disappointed really really really disappointed......I'm still hoping I can do this trip..... Oh I've heard it all about their is next year.... No way I want to go this year maybe I could wait for end of March instead of 1st of March......I worry about getting in a tent and getting out of tent.... I am truly heartbroken.... I guess I'm a fool for wanting to still do this..... Anyway I just wanted to update my journal and say I've been keeping up with all y'all......Take care and if God willing I will be on the trail.....,"

Texas Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553963,I was checking on how I was going to get to springer mountain.... Air or Bus...If I fly I would need to think about my poles- knife and anything else that can't be carried on board...I guess I could mail them things ahead to hiker hostel... I just don't want to put anything under the plane... I had previously a problem with lost luggage... And I've read about lost luggage from other people journal.... I can't afford to do that.... I can take a bus but we all know how long a bus can take.... Sometimes the price is about the same.... So I am still looking...But I got time ...... The reason I'm lollygagging is my knee..... Nothing really happening these past few days... Just walking a mile or 2 miles a day hurts alittle... I keep praying ...I have 30 days before I leave that's a long time.... Maybe I still have hope for my knee yet... as far as my pack I guess I'm ready as ready can be.... Meaning there are to many choices and I'm always finding something I like better... But I know what I have will work.... But if I can just get and keep the knee working..... Anyway I've been keeping up with all y'all and everyday seems like someone is leaving.... Take care and God bless you on your journey.... Texas Tornado....,"
