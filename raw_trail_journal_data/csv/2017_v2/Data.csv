I had flown into Charlottesville Airport and she shuttled me to the trailhead. Waynesboro is about 45 minutes from Charlottesville, so it is a good jumping off point. First day hike was moderate with no big climbs. The weather is dry and in the dry 70's.","

Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578588,"Hiked from Calf MountainShelter to Turk Gap, only 4.4 miles. The hills were killing me and I decided to hitch a ride to Loft Mountain Campsite. It was 10 miles from Turk Gap to the next shelter and I didn't want to risk getting stuck on the trail exhausted. At Loft Mountain, I rested up and got ready for some more hill climbs.","Calf Mountain Shelter
",Loft Mountain Campsite,"Sep 22, Fri",4.40
Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578589,"A good day of moderate climbs. I saw a bear at Ivy Creek. He ran away as soon as he saw me. I have also seen several deer and lots of south bound (Sobo) hikers. They started in Maine in June and aim to finish the trail in Georgia before Thanksgiving. Overall the trail is dry, many creeks and streams are dry. At this shelter, a very weak spring was barely flowing. What a difference from 2013 when it rained every day in SNP for 2 weeks.","

Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578590,"3 major climbs, I just need to pace myself. This hut had a great pipe spring. And good campsites. Met my first yo-yo. That's a hiker who hiked from Georgia to Maine then turned around to hike back to Georgia. Wow!  Makes me feel like a slacker.","Pinefield Hut
",Hightop Hut,"Sep 24, Sun",8.20
Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578591,"I hiked from 7:30 to 3. Over Hightop Mountain and Baldface Mountain. I am a slow climber but pick up speed elsewhere. This campsite is run by the National Park Service. With my senior pass, it costs only $7.50 and includes flushing toilets, running water, a campsite with hot showers and a laundry room. A great deal. Talked around a campfire with a hiker, Backdraft, a a couple from Wisconsin. A great evening. Dry & cool. As I was hiking I found a pair of glasses on the trail. They belong to a group of three lady hikers I met the previous day. I carried them to the camp site and luckily found the group before they lift the camp site.  The trail provides!","Hightop Hut

We got to the hut at 6:30, just as it was starting to get dark. This a a stone hut built by the CCC. A real classic, it even has a stone fire place inside, like the shelters in the Smokies.
