HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604821,"I am interested
in joining Warren Doyle’s 2017 van-supported Appalachian Trail thru hike.  Those who join this “expedition” must meet
certain training requirements.  Basically,
at a minimum a person must attend 4 prep hike training sessions held over the
course of 1 1/2 years.  These sessions consist of meeting for 4 days and
hiking 3 consecutive days during that time.  The last day is a
""reality check"" where we meet as a group and talk about the hike -
how we feel physically, how we like hiking in that manner, etc.
From
March 28 – 31, 2016, I attended Warren Doyle’s Appalachian Trail Institute where
Warren provided classroom instruction related to AT topics and conducted
several low mileage hikes.  This allowed
me to meet the first of four requirements needed to join the 2017 AT
expedition.",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Mon",0

attended my 2nd prep hike training session from 03/31/16 - 04/02/16.  During
this time, we hiked for three days as follows:
Kimberling
Creek to Garden Mt (17.4) to Picnic Pavilion (17.6) to Mt Rogers Visitor Center
(23.4).  Both nights at Garden Mt and the
Picnic Pavilion were cold and windy. 
Rather than set up a tent, I slept one night in the covered back of a truck
and the other in a van.  Three people
with whom I had spent most of my time hiking decided, upon reaching the Picnic
Pavilion, that they were dropping out the next day.  This made me sad and led me to exclaim to Warren
that “they are dropping like flies”.
These
miles will count toward section hiker status. They will have to be done again
if I try to get thru hiker status.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Thu",0

At my age (60), I don’t want to beat up my feet, knees, and hips any more that I have to. I was fortunate enough to find, and join, Warren Doyle’s 2017 “expedition” hike. This will be a van-supported hike whereby I will carry a daypack (essentially slack pack) and have my other camping equipment (tent, sleeping bag, ground pad, food, etc) delivered to a pre-determined site each night. The benefit is that I will have to carry less weight, thereby covering more miles in a day. The potential downside is that I will be hiking a set schedule. There are only 2 built-in rest days. I will have to hike whether I feel like it or not. I will not be able to hole up when the weather is bad.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Sun",0

I earned this name because my mother says I like to pack 36 hours into 24, and I like to stay busy and tend to run people ragged. HYLO is a takeoff from RYBO. It stands for “hike your legs off”. I feel this will be fitting since I will be “Hiking Your Legs Off” for over 2,000 miles. Also, I am sure this adventure will be full of highs and lows in the form of altitude ups and downs on the trail and emotional highs and lows from the challenges of the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Sun",0

For 18 months from July 2015 to December 2016, I lived in the north-Atlanta area. While I didn’t like living away from my family, this move greatly benefitted my preparation for a thru-hike. REI was directly across from the MARTA train station where I caught the train every day to go to work in Mid-Town. This made it very convenient to research and purchase equipment. I joined two Meetup hiking groups (Hike Georgia and Happy Trails) that posted challenging hikes every weekend. The people in these groups were great mentors and hiking buddies with whom I had a lot of fun and made some great memories. I also got to experience the Appalachian Trail in Georgia and see why, with all its ups and downs, it kicks many thru-hikers’ butts.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Sun",0

attended my 4th, and final, prep hike training session from 03/31/17 - 04/03/17.  The miles hiked over these days will count towards a thru-hike as long as I finish hiking all of the trail by 03/31/18.I retired on January 1, 2017 and am now living back home in Salem, VA. This enabled my husband, Reid, to drive me from Salem to Harrisburg, PA to meet the group for our final training hike.  Scott Grebe and Arlene Rios met us in Harrisburg where we all spent the night in a hotel and had a delicious meal at an Italian restaurant.    
This is the last of our training hikes before leaving on our journey on April 29th. It was a cold rain all day. We hiked on a ridge a good portion of the time where, on a sunny day, I imagine there are some beautiful views of the valley below. This wasn’t the case today as a fog hovered over the valley all day. This was a day where you learned to accommodate the wet rain as positively as possible. We set up our tents in the rain and slept in the rain. I am very pleased with my tent. I stayed dry and very comfortable.
The intricate road system of bridges crossing over the river that can been seen as you descend the ridge into Duncannon is impressive.",,Sherman Creek Rd (Duncannon),"Mar 31, Fri",18.30
HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558758,"We had our wet camping gear packed in the van and were ready to go by 7am. Today’s terrain consisted of more ridge-walking but also large rock outcroppings to hike over. Pennsylvania is known for its rocks. This is because this is how far the glaciers got before they receded and left their treasures of rock. There was no rain today but also no real views. I did see this interesting tree. At first I thought it was a tree that housed many messy birds. After looking at it more, I realized the mess is sap. It must be a good tree for getting food. It was cold and windy as we set up camp for the night. I was impressed how quickly my wet nylon tent dried out. I went to bed feeling nauseated and dealing with the runs, which had been coming on all day. Although we stopped to eat at a diner that served large portions of food, I was able to eat very little. I slept very comfortably in my tent despite having to get up in the middle of the night to find a tree. We were treated to the sound of barn owls singing during the night.",,Lisburn Rd,"Apr 01, Sat",21.90

Had I done this, it most likely would have been the end of my thru-hike attempt. Thru-hiking isn’t always easy and fun. Fueling my body with nothing more than 3 electrolyte gel tabs and 1 ½ bottles of vitawater, I hiked slower than normal but completed the mileage for the day. My ray of sunshine on this not-so-great-day was encountering a guy with a young benji-type, blonde-haired, black-bearded dog. When the dog spotted me, we connected like friends who were thrilled to see each other. I outstretched both hands into the air and enthusiastically said “hi”. Upon release, the well-trained dog (Randy) came running to greet me. He was a happy dog having a great time with his owner on the trail. Previously, he had been turned into a kill shelter (even though the prior owners had microchipped him). I commented to his owner that he would obviously have a good life now. (I wish I had gotten a picture. I need to learn to take time to take pictures of things that might have some meaning once the opportunity has passed.)
We are in the Cumberland Valley. We hiked through Boiling Springs and around its community lake, which made for a pretty area. Today was opening day for fishing and there were many people on the shore casting their lures. I talked to one guy who has been tying fly lures since he was 12. He showed me a case of beautiful, small, intricate, fly ties that he had made. (Again, I should have taken a picture.) From Boiling Springs, the hike went through some expansive farm fields then headed into the mountains for the rest of the day.",,"Pine Grove Furnace State Park, Gardners, PA","Apr 02, Sun",22.60

Family Member (FM): We hate to think about you being gone for 4 ½ months.
Me: I really hope you will be supportive of me going on this thru-hike.
FM: We support you in that we hope you are successful in completing your 
hike. That doesn’t mean we have to be happy that you will be gone 
for 4 ½ months.
My Mom (who always sees the bright side of things): Look at it this way. 
At least we love you and want you around instead of saying “thank 
goodness you will be gone for 4 ½ months”.

I have spent the last 18 months considering and buying gear (equipment, clothing, food, etc). At least one room in my house has been in disarray during my accumulation of this  gear.  I have spent the past 2 days totally focused on the final assembly of my gear so that it fits into my three 10 gallon containers. (I can only imagine how hard the task would be for someone who has to fit everything in a backpack while considering weight as well.)  My task is done and I am now headed to Atlanta for the kickoff on Springer Mt on Saturday.  I feel good about my gear.  While I know there will be some adjustments/modifications down the road, I am ready to go for now.",,View Entry,"Apr 26, Wed",0

From there we hiked the mile to reach the beginning of the AT on top of Springer. We took pictures then headed back down the AT towards the parking lot and on for about another 6 miles to our first night's destination. We are staying in a nice pavilion near a cemetary at Hickory Flats. We stopped at a waterfall today and cooled our feet in the water. 
Reid and Scott have been with me for a few days showing an interest and providing support. It has meant A LOT to me.

We've been batting 66% too wet. We hiked all morning in heavy rain and high wind. This was one of those mornings when you just put your head down to mark off the miles. There were no views at Preacher Rock or on Blood Mountain. However, very shortly after leaving the top of Blood Mountain, the clouds cleared and I am sure the views got pretty on top. The sun is shining this evening. We are drying out.","Woody Gap (GA 60)

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562780,"Only about 20% of hikers who start a thru-hike complete the journey. Hikers stop for many reasons - family issues, finances, discouragement, injuries, or other medical issues, etc. So it is scary to tell people you are attempting a thru hike and ask them to follow you. (I did so with hesitation.) You might have to tell everyone you didn't make it. 
Today a strong hiker in our group had to interrupt his hike due to a-fib issues. He (Scott) was somewhat of an anchor to our group. We will miss him. We hope that he can get his issue fixed quickly and join us somewhere up north.
The weather has been sunny and great today - a perfect temperature with a slight breeze. I am sitting on top of the mountain in the sun writing this entry. It is peaceful and quiet except for the occasional call of a bird.","Hogpen Gap (GA 348)

I am hearing lots of birds during my hike. Maybe this is because it is spring. I'm also seeing a lot of wild flowers - purple, yellow, scarlet, etc.
It was a sunny, pleasant day that got to around 78 degrees. This is starting to get on the warm side for hiking. The hike seemed hard today. We climbed up and down 3 mountains with long ascents and descents.","Unicoi Gap (Rt 17/75)

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563193,"Today I said goodbye to GA and crossed over into NC. The AT in GA was 78.2 miles. I hiked the first part of today through an area in GA that burned in the GA/NC fires last year. It was interesting to see that although the trunks of trees were burned about a foot from the ground, the trees were still living. I did pass through a rhododendron canopy which was dead even though the trunks had only been burned a little from the ground.
The GA/NC border is at Bly Gap. There is a wooden sign on a tree marking the border. Shortly from that is an interesting old oak tree on a knoll. This is the famous Bly tree. After leaving the oak tree, the trail immediately climbs a steep side of a mountain to the top. As I climbed, I had an overwhelming sense of the beauty of the mountains. I felt I was among the mountain tops. Whereas the mountains of Georgia seem to be in the distance, theses seemed to be on top of each other.
I saw some beautiful colored birds today, two of which I don't remember ever seeing before. One had a black head, wings, and tail, a white under-body, and red around its chest. The other was a soft solid grey with black near its eye. It was kind of tiny. I also saw an Oriole. I should mention that at our second campsite, I saw a Scarlet Taniger. It was striking red and deep black.
I am in my tent now as my hike is through for the day and it is pouring rain. We expect this weather (and maybe some snow for our 20 mile hike tomorrow [Friday]) Should be a fun hike (haha)!","Dicks Creek Gap (US 76)

We didn't get the rain in sheets or the snow as anticipated. The 1st half of the day was spent walking in a cool drizzling rain with no views. The first half of today's hike also passed through forest that had been burned during last year's fire in NC. It made me realize just how large of an area was burned. The fog cleared during the 2nd part of the day just in time to get some excellent views from Albert Mountain. It is drizzling again this evening.

Many thru-hikers were bailing out and going into town. I decided not to set up my messy wet tent and instead slept in a shelter for the first time. I stayed dry and warm.
Today started out clear. We went into Franklin, NC, to eat at Shoneys, then hiked to our destination of Wayah Bald. As we got close to the Bald, the rain set in again. It was a very cold rain. We got pelted by small hail. I tried to set up my already wet tent in this cold, wet, very miserable weather. This is the most challenging, frustrating day I have had so far. It made me question what I'm doing out here. We should have a gorgeous view where we are, but it is socked in. (Maybe tomorrow.) We have two vehicles with our group right now so we all have scrapped setting up tents and are sleeping in the vehicles. One guy is sleeping in an outhouse-type privy. YUCK to the conditions! Where is the sun?
Last night where are hike ended, there was a couple with a baby waiting for friends to pull them off the trail for the night. It was the couple from Roanoke who are attempting a thru-hike with their baby. All three of them (baby included) were just as pleasant as can be despite the weather.
Bring on the sunshine. This cold, miserable rain is going to either break me or make me stronger. I was pretty grumpy until I got a space in a vehicle to sleep. Goodnight. I know I am dry and warm, atleast until I step out of the vehicle tomorrow. My nice tent is a soggy, very dirty mess.","Rock Gap

Just before I left the bald for today's hike I got to see the gorgeous mountain view. The day was clear, bright, and sunny. (Yay!, Finally!) I had beautiful views of the mountains and valleys all day.
Again, today we hiked much of the time through fire ravaged forest. Part of the hike went along a narrow ridge with very steep sides. This is where the heaviest burn damage seem to be. But most of the forest is still intact and pretty. I was able to look to the horizon and see Clingman's Dome and Mount LeConte in the Smokies. They received 6 inches of snow last night. I could see the snow.
We are staying at the NOC tonight. I managed to set up my tent for a while so that I could dry it out and wipe off the dirt. I'm feeling much better about the state of its condition.

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563755,"Bob (one of my hiking buddies) and I were on the trail looking at an acorn that had sprouted and was establishing a root in the ground. I commented it probably wouldn't survive as it was in a place where it could easily get stepped on. Just then a fast-paced hiker came up the trail towards us. Bob commented ""How many hikers does it take to step on an acorn?"" As the hiker came by, she stepped on the acorn. Bob immediately said, ""It takes only one"" and we both laughed. I then gently pulled the sprouting acorn out of the trail and replanted it off on the side of the trail where it stands a better chance of taking root and growing. (Simple pleasures of the trail.)
We ate breakfast at the NOC (I don't think I've lost any weight yet) before starting a long, steep climb out of the Nantahala River Valley. We were on a ridge much of the day. It was a sunny, pleasant day with great views.
At the first overlook that looked down to the NOC from where we had come, there were several Scarlet Tanigiers calling to each other. I managed to spot one. They are beautiful birds. I spent about 1 and 1/2 basking in the sun and taking in the scenery on Checoah Bald.
This is the first time in a number of days that we didn't hike through any burned forests. I noticed I haven't seen many flowers but I think that's because we've been at higher elevations.","Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) - (US 19/74)

The birds have sung all day in the forest. 
We are at Fontana Dam tonight, so we have the view of a pretty lake. Tomorrow we head into the Smokies for a 2-day backpacking trip.

I heard a bird that may have been a whip-or-will.
We are backpacking the next 2 days through the Smokies. Today there were lots of wildflowers on the Trail but not any viewpoints. You had to through the forest to get a glimpse of the ridgeline. I heard a bobwhite calling in the woods, which thrilled me. I haven't heard one in years.","Fontana Dam

The weather was clear so there were great views. I saw three turkeys. On a good part of the trail I kept hearing a phff, phff in the dry leaves. I finally realized it was grasshoppers jumping in the leaves. They must have just hatched out. There were lots of them.
The approach to Clingman's Dome is through an old growth forest. It was a delight to my nose. The views on approach to Clingman's were beautiful. I kept wanting to take pictures, but finally decided I would have to do what my sister's young nephew did - blink really hard to take pictures with my eyes. At Clingman's Dome, I saw a baby bear in a tree. I heard that the mama bear and two cubs were close by.

I was tired, dehydrated, and had eaten little since the long hike yesterday. We went into Gatlinburg to grocery shop, do laundry and clean up. It started to rain very hard shortly after we arrived in town. Rather than head back up the mountain to spend the night in the rain, we opted to get a hotel room. We had a great pasta meal, went to an outdoor store, got ice cream, and took hot showers in our rooms. It's amazing how time off the trail can invigorate the spirit and reset your mood so that you are ready to tackle the trail again. 
Two of my hiking friends from Georgia visited Newfound Gap before I finished my hike.They left me a nice note of encouragement. Thanks, Mary Louise and Lars for making the effort to see me. I was disappointed I missed you.
It was very interesting to see how last December's fire burned Gatlinburg. During the fires, there were 80-90 mile per hour winds. The winds carried the hot embers from one ridge to another. So the little valleys didn't burn but many of the ridges burned from the top down towards the town.","Clingman's Dome

A lot of the hike was up on a narrow ridge ridge, so I know that the mountain scenery would have been gorgeous.
We spent the night at a shelter. I like the shelters in the Smokies. They have a water source nearby as well as a privy. They also have cables for hanging up your food away from the bears. Inside are two wooden tiers for people to put out their ground pads and sleeping bags for sleeping. There are nails and rope to hang packs. A tarp hangs clear across the opening of the shelter to enclose the sleeping area inside. Outside is a table/bench area for cooking and visiting. We had about 20 people in the shelter last night. Eventually (early, I might add), everyone crawls into their bags to sleep. We look like a bunch of pigs in a blanket. I find it soothing and relaxing to hear the hum of activity while I'm drifting off to sleep.
All the people seem friendly, accommodating, and interesting. At the shelter last night, we had thru-hikers from Australia, Germany, and Bermuda.

This morning I got to see the sunrise from the bald as I headed out for my 20.6 mile hike. The hike was uneventful. It is starting to get hotter and I need to remember to drink more.

He is hiking with our group to get pictures of the trail that he missed while he had a broken camera. Today is Bob's last day with us. I will miss him. He had his own car, so Warren would drive him to our ending point for the day and he would hike south to our starting point. He would pick up his car and drive it to where he started for that day.

In the picture above, the white blaze combination tells the hiker that the AT will be making a change in direction to the right.  The blue blaze marks where a side trail connects with the AT at that point on the trail.
A brown blaze is not used to mark a trail, but a person might hear reference to a ""brown-blaze"" trail.  This is the random path a hiker takes through the woods to find a place to use the bathroom.  I followed brown-blazed trails 2-3 times a day.","

Warren emphasizes that the rate of injuries go up in relation to weight and speed.  He is right.  On the second day of my backpacking trip in the Smokies (my longest day when I hiked from Clingman's Dome to a shelter), I was hiking faster than normal to get to the shelter before dark and before all the spaces were taken.  I stepped on a rock the wrong way and immediately felt a sharp twinge in my inner right knee.  The next day, I couldn't bring the toe of my right foot past my left foot, so I hiked all day stepping out on my left and bringing my right up to meet it.  The following day, I could extend my right foot out a little farther, but it was extremely painful to push off from a stop to a start.  That day, I tried to stop as little as possible.  I thought over the following days I could slow down a little, ditch the heavy weight of the backpack, and let my knee gradually heal.  The healing didn't seem to take place.  I just got slower and slower while trying to deal with the pain.  On the 18th and 19th days' hikes before Reid picked me up, I had the song ""Rescue Me and Wrap Me in Your Arms"" running through my head the entire day.  Reid was my knight in shining armor when I finally met him to go home.  
I hobbled around the house over the weekend waiting to see the doctor on Monday.  She said my mcl isn't torn as my knee is stable.  She said the bursa sac in my inner-right knee is swollen.  Essentially, I have bursitis of the knee.  (I still think I might have a slight tear but not a total tear.  There was an event that started my downward spiral of pain.)  She gave me a cortisone shot, the results of which I am still waiting to see.  I am convalescing and anxiously waiting to see improvement.  At this time, I walk as well as my 87-year-old mother who is somewhat slow and unsteady on her feet.  
I never expected the trail to get me so quickly.  I guess most hikers don't.  While I have always admired the accomplishment of those who have completed a thru-hike, my short time on the trail has shown me in even more detail the challenges, hardships, and discomfort those hikers face to complete their goal.  I tip my hat to each and every one of them.  I wish I could ""will"" myself to continue my hike on my injured knee, but I just don't have the grit to suffer in that way, nor do I want to risk permanent damage.
Please check back in a couple of weeks.  As my knee starts to feel better, I may consider rejoining the group farther north.  If I do, I will begin posting on my site again.

Duck has a 1 ½ mile (one way) board walk along the sound.  We walked it near dusk and had a great time.  It was also good conditioning for my knee.  Along the walk, we saw 2 types of herons, a raccoon, a turtle digging a nest to lay eggs, and heard frogs start singing loudly in unison, then suddenly stop.  The board walk is a real treasure.","

We parked one car at VA663 near the Woods Hole hostel (which looked very nice).  We ran into a thru-hiker named red fox, whose name suited him well.  He had red hair and a red beard.   He had spent the past 11 days at Woods Hole healing a bruised knee cap he acquired from falling on the trail.  While there, the owners took a vacation and passed to him the responsibility of running the place.  
The day was beautiful – clear sky and moderate temperature.  This was a perfect hike to test my knee.  It was long, but not too long.  It climbed up Pearis Mountain, then followed the ridge line for many miles.  It descended into Pearisburg and crossed a highway bridge across the New River.  
This hike was somewhat nondescript.  There was one nice view of the valley floor.  The view from Angel’s Rest was minimal due to trees.  It also looked down on a large plant facility.  My knee handled it well.","Sugar Run Gap (VA 663)

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571019,"This hike climbed from Pearisburg to Peters Mountain and ran along the ridge for many miles.  The weather was perfect once again. 
We drove up and down a very small section of VA663 trying to determine the parking spot for our car switch, which ended up being the Cherokee Flats picnic area.  On our 3rd pass of the section, there was a deer on the right side of the road.  As we passed, a VERY young fawn hopped up from the grass and wobbled further off the side to its mother.  We thought this was interesting since we hadn’t see the deer on our previous passes.

This hike had several nice views and crossed through 2 fields. One of the fields was densely packed with milkweed.  Nancy and I are great fans of milkweed, which is the monarch butterflies’ only plant on which is lays its eggs.  (We would like to come back where the caterpillars are growing and morphing.)  There were lots of other butterflies taking advantage of the nectar from the flowers.  There were lots of other flowers blooming in the fields as well.

We were buzzed by military training jets at different times.  Unfortunately, we were always in the woods, never saw them, but always heard their impressive sounds.  We ran into one thru hiker who was in the field when they came by.  He was pumped about seeing them and even called his dad to talk about them.  We think they either came from Fort Bragg, NC or the Virginia coastal area.       

We took a break on some rocks in the middle of the trail and had several thru-hikers stop to talk.  One was a young woman named Parakeet.  (She is vegetarian and eats a lot of different seeds – chia, pumpkin, flax, etc – thus her name.)  She had been off the trail for a few days with strep throat.  
We came across a thru-hiker teetering on a large flat rock in the trail who told us he had just come upon a large snake on the side of the trail.  He was trying to determine where it was.  Snakes typically don’t want to see people and it had disappeared into the thick foliage on the side of the trail.  We thanked him for warning us and stamped our feet as we walked through that section of the trail.
We saw a baby bird who had just flown from the nest and was hopping down the trail.  Its mother was in the foliage on the side of the trail keeping a close eye on her baby.
Towards the end of this hike there used to be a zipline that hikers could ride across a small creek to get to the “Captain’s” yard where he offered camping.  What fun!  Unfortunately, the Captain had surgery on 05/24/17 for mouth cancer, so the zipline had been removed.  We wish the Captain a speedy, fully recovery.

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571020,"This is out of sequence from the last 2 hikes as I wanted to have some time at in the afternoon to do other things.   

We began our hike at VA620.  VA620 is gravel and goes down a short steep slope into a shallow creek bed before getting to the trailhead.  Just before the creek bed, there is a “private” bridge that goes over the creek.  Since I had my truck, I went through the creek bed.  After the hike, Nancy used the private bridge during the car switch.  As we were leaving to go home, I crossed the creek bed in my truck while she used the private bridge.  Just as she was ready to exit the private bridge, a truck came up to cross the private bridge.  It was perfect timing.  The truck had to back up to let her exit the bridge.  I playfully scolded her for crossing on the private bridge. 
The weather was, again, perfect.  The humidity has been low so the mountains and valleys look crisp.  This hike ascended to Cove Mountain where it ran along the ridge with a number a beautiful views across the valley.  Nancy and I decided one view equaled or surpassed the view from MacAfee’s Knob.  Eventually, the trail comes into Dragon’s Tooth.  I have hiked Dragon’s Tooth many times, but always from 311 or a farmer’s field (many years ago).  Coming from this side was a treat! 
Nancy is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about plants.  Her enthusiasm rubs off.  We crossed an area thick with small white flowers–maybe some sort of daisy.  We saw a dense area of Fairy Wand (also known as black cohos), which was voted as the 2017 Virginia plant of the year.  Nancy told me it is labelled “black” because even though the flower is white the root is black.  It looks very similar to the galax, which is also a white flower on a skinny stalk.  I am sure there are other differences, but what I mentioned is what my simple mind retains.  
The climb down Dragon’s Tooth is very rocky.  There are some places where you have to sit on your butt to slide down.  We saw several people with dogs going up.  I questioned on my mind how the dogs manage to negotiate the rocks.  (I do know that years ago I also took dogs over those rock.  I would think twice about it now.) 
After Dragon’s Tooth, the trail entered another open field, which was full of flowers and sunshine. 
Towards the end of the hike, we saw a fat bullfrog in the trail.  He didn’t move.  I think this was a defense mechanism.  Staying still, he blended into his background.  Had he hopped off, he could have been seen as moving prey. 
The rocks on Dragon’s Tooth were another good test for my knee, which handled it well.  I have to be aware of the angle I am stepping onto a rock with my right knee.  It is THAT certain angle that caused the problem in the first place.  It is that angle that causes me to feel a certain twinge now.  I try diligently to avoid that angle, which isn’t a normal knee angle.","Trout Creek (VA 620)

This hike includes two climbs – Potts Mountain, then Johns Creek Mountain.  It had some ridge walking, which I am thankful for on such a long hike.  Shortly beyond half-way, we took a lunch break at a footbridge that crossed a stream.  We soaked our feet, which was a delight.  We watched a large crawfish in the stream.   The trail was noneventful until near the end.  Toward the end, we saw deer 2 separate times.  (This is the 1st time I have seen deer on my expedition hike.)  The highlight was walking through 2 open fields with lots of milk weed, other wild flowers, and butterflies.  Lots of birds were singing, so we paused, closed our eyes, and listened to all the different bird calls.  It was wonderful. 
This trail was rocky – not climbing rocky, but stepping rocky.  I had to be aware of how I was stepping on the rocks.  At times, the conditions were similar what I was hiking on when I injured my knee.  I had to be careful how I placed my foot.  Once or twice I felt “the twinge”.  I am writing this post a day later.  My knee feels it a little today.  Hopefully, another week of rest will strengthen it more.","Stoney Creek (VA 635)

In the evening on this road, we met a family of turkeys crossing to the other side of the road, which had a steep embankment. One adult turkey flew over and about 8 juveniles attempted follow. Some didn’t make it to the top, landed on the embankment, and then walked the rest of the way to the top. Finally, the tom flew over the road to the top to be with his family (gaggle?). It was fun to watch.
The trail for this hike ascended Sinking Creek Mountain and walked along the ridge for a long way. In many spots, the ridge was rocky. It descended the mountain, then ascended Brush Mountain where it followed a shorter ridge before descending to Trout Creek.

On Sinking Creek ridge, we ran into a bunch of large rock piles (see photos) spread in the woods along the ridge. I thought they might be remnants of an old rock wall fence. However, I don’t know why anyone would make the effort to the tear down the wall and stack the rocks in piles.
We hiked passed the Keffer oak tree which is the largest oak in the southern AT. It is 18’ in diameter and estimated to be 300 years old.
We passed a sign marking the Eastern continental divide.

On Brush Mountain, we saw the Audit Murphy memorial. Audie Murphy was one of the most decorated combat soldiers in WW2. He had a 21-year acting career after the war. The memorial is near the site where he died in a plane crash.","Sinking Creek (VA 630)

each other. I outstretched both hands into the air and enthusiastically said
“hi”. Upon release, the well-trained dog (Randy) came running to greet me. He
was a happy dog having a great time with his owner on the trail. Previously, he
had been turned into a kill shelter (even though the prior owners had
microchipped him). I commented to his owner that he would obviously have a good

I failed to mention that the other day we ran into a man and his daughter who were hiking. They were carrying a big box of local peaches and giving them to thru-hikers they were meeting on the trail. The peaches were delicious. Such gestures are much appreciated by hikers.
Also, we saw a young buck on the trail who wasn't concerned at all about us being near them.
I'm still wearing a brace on my knee for support, but it is doing really well. I'm not feeling it at all. I am taking an anti-inflammatory supplement called Curcumin that I purchased at Nature's Outlet. Lots of people swear by it and I'm wondering if I am seeing its benefit.
I had lost 15 pounds by the time I got off the trail with my injured knee. This time, I am trying to eat better. I'm eating as much as I can when the opportunity arises. I'm wondering if I am gaining weight now!","Hawk Mt Rd (Eckville, PA)

Then he shuttled us to another point where we started the rest of our hike. The profile for the rest of the hike had us climbing up to a ridge and then staying at that elevation for the rest of the time. It looked easy.
I should have read the description. Even though there weren't any ups and downs, THERE WERE ROCKS! These rocks make it very slow going because you have to pick your way across them to avoid injury. It is the sort of stuff that could hurt my knee, but my knee seems to have handled it.
This region of PA has wide, long rectangular valleys with ridges that parallel them. I am thinking these ridges are moraine piles of rocks left by glaciers. We hiked on the ridge that parallels the Lehigh Valley. We hiked over many talus piles.
 We hiked over one area called the knife edge. It was relatively short but there was only one way through it. While I was picking my way across it, it began to rain very hard. I kept hoping the lightening would hold off until I got off it. Luckily, it did.
I am wet tonight from the rain.
I met several hikers who were tired of the rocks and couldn't wait to get out of PA. The rocks make hiking tough, but I guess it is great training for the White Mountains to come.","Blue Mt Summit (PA 309)

There was no sense in putting on dry clothes that were going to get wet almost immediately. Once my body heat warmed up my wet clothes, I hardly noticed that they were wet. (Hence the title of this entry.) There were times during the hike when parts of my clothes dried but then it would start to rain hard again.
This hike climbed up to the top of the mountain and then stayed on top all day. The most challenging part of the hike was the rocks in the trail.
Patti, whom I was hiking behind, came upon a copperhead on the trail. She squealed and the snake moved to the side of the trail.
Today is a town day. After the hike, our group went to town where we ate dinner, did laundry, and got a motel room. We all feel great that we have clean clothes and bodies.

That changed after we stopped about midway through to have lunch on an outcropping of rocks named ""Wolf Rocks"". The view from Wolf Rocks was spectacular. While eating there, I saw something very interesting I've never seen before. (It became the highlight of my day.) There was a group of Bumble Bees that appeared to be feeding on some white substance in the cracks of the rock face. I'm assuming it was pollen. I could see their proboscis touching the rock. A butterfly and stink-bug joined them in doing the same thing.We had several nice views looking into the valley and the Delaware Water Gap. We saw some neat mushrooms and fungi. One mushroom was purple (see my picture). We ate blueberries and blackberries. We had a fun talk with a Ridge-runner who had a handful of berries for a salad. We looked into a puddle on the forest floor and observed polliwogs. We saw a nonpoisonous snake on a rock.Tonight (Saturday) we are camped at the Delaware Water Gap. We ate in the quaint, outdoorsy town. We had a great laugh during dinner, which I have tried to tell below:I was taking some mac and cheese back to my pack to eat for lunch tomorrow. I commented that I would be eating it with my fingers because I didn't have a fork. My group asked if I had a spork (a small utensil with a spoon on one end and a fork on the other). I jokingly replied ""yes, but I didn't want to carry it because it was too much weight.' Bill, who can deliver funny stories in a flash got a serious look on his face and quickly replied, ""I saw a guy today with a pack on, walking hunched over...I said to myself, 'that guy is carrying...a spork!'

The bubble typically takes shape when most hikers begin their journey sometime in March. It then progresses intact as hikers make their way north. However, the bubble gets smaller over time as hikers quit the trail.One of the reasons we started our expedition at the end of April was to avoid the large starting bubble. We have been hiking with a lot of the same people for a week now. I've enjoyed getting familiar with other hikers. We're sharing campsites with a large number of hikers. The other day, I passed a day-hiker going in the opposite direction (south) who said he counted 32 Thru-hikers. (That was BEFORE he passed our group.) Last night I counted 26 tents at our campsite. (It's interesting to note that by dusk or dark, all hikers are tucked in bed. It's also interesting to note that there are a lot of women hiking the trail.)Warren says the bubble we're grouped with will eventually move ahead of us as our per-day mileage will decrease as we hike the New England Mountains.Today was an ordinary long hike. It was pretty, but there's not much to tell about it. We hiked to a lake with a sandy beach and concession stand. I stayed at the concession stand area for about an hour.

I wonder if it had a nest nearby and was trying to distract me from it? (When I first came upon it, I though it was a chicken in the woods.)I saw a lot of bird activity on the trail today. They weren't singing. I believe they were foraging and fattening up for winter.The other day on the trail, I saw a fledgling that had just left the nest. Its parent was on the side of the trail in the trees talking to it. The baby bird looked like a black ball of feathers.At the moment I'm enjoying a gorgeous sunset at a location know as Height of the Land! (Note picture above!)Cheers!","South Arm Rd (Andover, ME)

It had a lot of slabs of Granite making it easy to walk on. It had Alpine Foliage and wide open views. Going up the Horn was similar but not quite as grand. From Saddleback, you could see the trail from where you cam. Although the sky was overcast, the scenery was still beautiful.The trail in Maine is known for its roots.

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576755,"My fellow hiking companion, Charli, did a training prehike last year on the trail we covered today. It was the first time she had ever hiked the rocky New England trails. She tells the story of coming to a huge slab of steep rock that she didn't know how she was going to get down. She finally spread her arms and legs out as wide as she could, and went down on her butt.I have been very apprehensive about this rock and how I would handle it. In my mind, I pictured a huge slab of granite similar to what we hiked up on Baldpate and Saddleback, only at a VERY steep angle and VERY long. I never ran into the rock I imagined. (I had questioned in my mind if that rock was so steep and terrible, how come there wasn't rebar on it.)Similarly, I had a trail angel tell me about a slab of rock in the Whites where you looked like you were going to drop into oblivion. She couldn't get over it the first year. She came back the next year and realized that if you went a little further around to the right, there were roots you could cling to to assist your descent. I dreaded (and looked) for that rock and never found it either.There are several lessons I have learned from this. First, I learned your imagination can conceive and then blow up out of proportion someone else's description of something. Second, someone's description of a new experience can make that experience more frightening (in your mind) than it really is. Third, there are places on the AT where you have to use extreme concentration, take it slow, and move with care, but the AT is doable. There is nothing ridiculously dangerous out here.So don't let an imagination gone wild keep you from hiking the AT or doing anything else you want to do for that matter. Explore it and see if it is as big as you imagined.Last night at camp it was cold. It's actually warmer when we woke up. The wind blew quite hard before afternoon and it is cold again.

Warren gave me an avenue for hiking the trail and experiencing the camping aspect of it without beating up my body by carrying a heavy pack.
Warren is a well known figure among the AT community. He has completed hiking the AT a record 17 times. At one time, he held the record for hiking the AT in the shortest number of days at 55. As a younger man, he was quite the adrenaline junkie and go-getter on the trail. Today he runs the Appalachian Trail Institute for hikers that want to learn more about hiking the trail.
Warren organizes and supports these expeditions as a ""labor of love"". He wants others to experience what the trail has to offer. He makes no money off of the trips. From my observation, I could see that it takes incredible patience to move up the trail each day seeing the group off in the early morning and waiting for and ensuring everyone was safely in by evening.
The trade-off of Warren's trip versus a pack is that we had a daily hiking schedule to follow. If the weather was bad, we hiked. If we were tired and would have liked to have a non-hiking day, too bad, we hiked. If there was a town we thought might be interesting to spend some time in, too bad, we hiked. If we got an injury and had to drop out for a while, too bad. The group continued moving northward and it was up to the injured person to make up what had been missed. However, sticking to a daily hiking schedule ensured that a group of 7-8 people got to their destination in a reasonable amount of time.

I'm staying at Uncle Johnny's Hostel and Outfitters on the Nolichucky River in Irwin, TN. The hostel is 60 feet from the AT. Today I hiked from Spivey, TN back to the hostel. A lot of the trail passed through tunnels of rhododendrons. Also, there were lots of areas where the trail was covered with red leaves that had fallen from trees. It made for a pretty trail.
Uncle Johnny was a thru-hiker. He purchased the property the hostel is on from an 82 year-old man that he met when he passed through the area hiking the AT. This individual was getting married and building his wife a new house. It's on the bank of the Nolichucky River. It offers close-by hiking, shuttle services, tubing, canoeing and cycling adventures. I wouldn't mind spending more time here to take advantage of all the hostel and area has to offer.
The owners/workers are very nice and are animal lovers. They have an old, big Rottie (Jerry Garcia) who is blind in one eye that lives on the property. He is so sweet and laid back. When I pet him and stop, he gently brushes my leg with his paw asking for more. They also have a young cat that recently showed up whom they are trying to tame (on its own terms). It hangs out near the open door by their pay counter, so folks can see its antics. They also have two black rabbits that were recently dropped off and are making their home at the hostel.
I'm enjoying my time here while knocking off some make-up miles on the AT.

Typically, when a group of hikers pass the nest, the one in front disturbs the nest and those trailing are prone to get stung. Today I passed a nest on the trail where the opening had been dug out. I presume a bear had been looking for food. I stopped to try to understand what I was looking at. I was going to take a picture (it was quite interesting) but then I noticed the yellow jackets hovering at the opening appeared to be getting agitated.

It's a trip I never forgot. I was enthralled with the beauty of the balds. It rained during the day as we hiked to our camping spot on top of Big Hump. That evening the weather cleared. I sat in a grassy field on the bald and watched fog roll over the saddle in the mountain below me. Once over the saddle, the fog would dissipate into the air. The next day was brilliantly clear. We sat on Little Hump and enjoyed the spectacular 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains. I never forgot the beauty of this trip and have always wanted to return.Today was my ""return"" day. I hiked over the balds, saw the 360 degree views, and saw the saddle that the fog rolled over, once again. It was nostalgic!

For the past two nights, I have been staying at the Mountain Harbor Hostel. They cook a wonderful breakfast. There are numerous dogs on the property (which I like), as well as cats and a goat.
The hostel provides shuttle service to various trail-heads. Today, I caught a shuttle to my starting point, along with another couple. I hike ahead of them.
Along the hike, there is a place where the trail goes straight into a blue blaze trail to a waterfall while the AT takes a 90 degree turn up a steep hill. I ended up at the waterfall (which I did want to see), but I didn't realize I'd gotten off the AT at the turn. After viewing the falls, I returned to the AT and turned right to head on. About a mile down the trail, I ran into the couple who were on my shuttle. My first reaction was ""Hey, how did you get HERE?""  (After all I was ahead of them.) Then it hit me that I had made a wrong turn on the trail and was hiking the wrong way! Thank goodness this couple was on my shuttle. Who knows how much farther I would have gone in the wrong direction.
There is a simple rule to keep in mind that helps to prevent one from going in the wrong direction when getting off the trail and then returning to it. It is: if you turn right when you get off the trail, turn right when you get back on, and vice versa.
I have gone in the wrong direction twice during my AT journey. Both times it has been when the trail makes a 90 degree turn at the point where I got off. Depending on where I'm standing and looking when I'm getting back on, right or left can confuse me when there is a 90 degree turn.
The trail was pretty. I saw some color changes in some trees and the trail paralleled a pretty creek passing through some lovely plush fields.

Reid is accompanying me.Today was a hot, humid, sunny day with temperatures in the mid-80's. Reid hiked 12 miles with me to Turk Gap. We had a few nice views. The path took us near several large microwave towers. I saw a big, thick, green caterpillar that had what looked like a blue spear on its rear-end. The caterpillar crawled partially under some leaves. I moved them so Reid could see it. When I did that, the caterpillar began thrashing about and continued to thrash for some time. It was interesting to see. I'm thinking the thrashing about was a protective move. I wonder if the blue spear is for defensive protection. It's picture is in my gallery.We met a hiker named Iron Heart. (IH). He is a sudden cardiac survivor who had a near death experience. He shared this experience with us. (Reid has read a lot of material on this subject.) IH suddenly fell out of his chair while playing poker at a Las Vegas Casino due to sudden cardiac arrest. He flat-lined 6 times. He was put into a hyperthermic (sp) coma but the doctor's couldn't successfully bring him out of it and expected him to die. IH described being enveloped in wonderful warm water with a beautiful light refracting into it while in the coma. His deceased dad spoke to him 3 times telling him it wasn't his time and that he needed to go back. After the 3rd time, his dad told him he still had things to accomplish and gave him a hard push on the head. At that point, Iron Heart took a big gasp and came out of his coma to the surprise of several nurses in the room at the time. Reid and I had tears in our eyes listening to his account.After this incident, IH lost 60 lbs and joined the Iron Heart group, which is a group of people who have suffered cardiac issues but have come back to run races, cycle races, run marathons and entered into all sorts of endurance events. IH is bringing the element of Long-Distance Hiking into the Iron Heart Fellowship. He says he is now a much calmer, happy person. He realizes every day is a gift.The last 5 miles of my hike, I hooked up with a very nice college student named Kadin Sullivan. He is currently studying Chinese and Math, but has decided to take a break and hike the Pacific Crest Trail next year. We talked a lot about gear.

Last night was very foggy, but we woke up in the morning to weather clearing. It was so foggy last night that we had trouble finding the road to our resort building (Shenandoah) where we were booked for the night. I ended up alone in my truck on the Skyline Drive in thick, thick fog after making a wrong turn. It was somewhat unnerving. My hiking App, Guthook, got me back to the resort where Reid rescued me.
There was fog in the valley for most of the morning, but it was clear on top where we were located. It was pretty to look at the fog below.
Reid didn't hike with me. Instead he did photography work for most of the day. He surprised me and met me on an overlook the AT crossed by and provided me with some trail magic. It made my day to see him unexpectedly.
My highlight today was seeing 2 walking sticks. They were going in the same direction of the trail, but not close together. I have seen a few walking sticks in my lifetime, so to see two in one day is a rarity to me.
The trail crossed Little Stony Man Cliffs. The highest point in SNP is Stony Man Summit. It was a weekend day. There were lots of people hiking. I believe most of the people came from Northern Virginia or the D.C. area. Near the end of my hike was a rock outcropping with a pretty view called the Pinnacles. There were so many folk on the outcrop and tons of people hiking up to it. The trail was quite congested.

Today when Reid and I drove into the trail-head parking lot at Tuckers Lane in Linden, VA, there was a white sedan in the lot. As we exited the car for me to prepare to hit the trail, I commented that I had left my poles in the other car. I lamented that I would just have to hike without poles. Then I heard a familiar voice and saw a familiar person. It was Warren Doyle, my 2017 thru-hike expedition organizer and leader!  He had come up to DC for the weekend to see his daughter perform and had spent the night in his car at the trail-head. Warren said he wouldn't have paid attention to the car that drove into the lot, but when he heard poles being mentioned, he figured it was a hiker and looked to see who it was. It was fun to run in to Warren. He gave me a pole to use as well as a small blueberry pie and drink.Later in the hike, I had another pleasant and unexpected surprise.

The day was clear, giving me nice views. I ran into two thru-hikers that I met in the SNP (Oakie and Shep and his dog Ollie - who are in my October 15th pictures). It was fun talking to them. To celebrate the summer solstice on June 21st, brave hikers hike in the nude that day.  Oakie not only hiked in the nude (almost), but he hiked that way on the part AT that goes through MacAfee's Knob! MacAfee's is a very popular, busy place. I am sure he passed LOTS of people that day. He said he hiked with a bandanna covering his front private area and was miserable all day because a pack on bare skin hurts. At least he didn't burn his butt!Today, I saw something for a second time, that I have been unsuccessful in capturing in a  photo. I saw what I think is  spider wasp. It is actually a pretty flying insect. Its body is stream-lined and deep black (almost velvety looking). Its wings are a shiny blue. Both that I have seen were dragging a large dead spider along the ground. (I guess the spider is too heavy to lift off the ground.) My research says that these wasps take the spider back to their nest and lay an egg on it. When the egg hatches, the larvae feeds on the spider. It appears to take a big effort to drag a large dead spider through the forest floor, but these spider wasps are diligent.

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580580,"815.2 - 806.7SOBOThis was a low mileage hike day. Because I am slackpacking, my hikes must start and end where the trail crosses a road that has parking. Not parking at Salt Log Gap would have required me to hike 25 miles in one day.The road to Salt Log was several miles long and gravel, but it was in good condition.I expected this to be a day of just marking off some miles. I was pleasantly surprised at what the trail had to offer.Two miles in, the trail crossed another parking area called Hog Camp Gap (also gravel). There were a number of cars parked at this spot and from this point on, I saw numerous people. This was surprising to me since access was by a long drive on a gravel road. At Hog Gap,  I saw a family enjoying apples from a tree.From here, the trail went over a large grassy bald similar to a small version of the balds on Roan/Hump mountains in NC. Bald. On this short hike, I had some really nice views. I thoroughly enjoyed this short hike.Cheers!","Salt Log Gap/USFS63 (Alto, VA)

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580581,"815.2 - 832.1NOBOI saw tons of people on the trail today, inspite of forecasted weather of low 50's and high chance of rain. I figure the people either were either uninformed, risk-takers, or so interested in hiking that they didn't mind getting cold and wet. Sure enough, it started to rain around 1pm and rained the rest of the day.The man pictured for my post is a handsome Scot from the MacGregor clan that I ran into on the trail. He was very dashing! (I should have asked him if he was wearing his regular hiking clothes or if he was observing some occasion.) For those of you who look at my pictures on my trail journal site, I have posted a picture of me showing what I was wearing today.  You might get a chuckle out of the comparison between the Scot and me. He is the chieftain and I am the common man. I had some unusual interactions with people today. First, I came upon 3 backpackers who had a pretty dog wander into their camp last night, complete with a dog pack and leader harness, but missing its owner. It was carrying a prescription with its name, the owner's name, and the vet's phone #. The hikers will make sure the dog is reunited with its owner, but they will probably have the dog on their 3-day hike since the vet is closed until Monday. It makes you wonder what happened. Hopefully, the owner is ok.While talking to 2 thru-hikers at a shelter about the dog, I clarifed with them that I had seen another of their thru-hiking companions ahead of them on the trail. They were very surprised and were trying to figure out how she got ahead of them.Finally, as I was leaving the shelter, I ran into a group of young female hikers whose friend was going to pick them up on a particular road, but they weren't sure where the road was. They didn't have a map or anything else to help them. With my AWOL trail guide and map, we were able to determine that they needed to turned around and hike about 2 miles in the other direction.My trail took me over The Priest and Spy Rock. (Most of the people I saw were in the Spy Rock area.) The Priest is a high mountain that has either a 4.5 mile ascent or descent depending on what direction a person is hiking. I was glad I was going in the direction of the descent as there were no views due to the weather. I would have been disappointed to put all that effort into a 4.5 mile climb only to find the views were fogged in. I didn't get to see what people were hoping to see at Spy Rock, either.In the higher elevations, the leaves are gone. In the lower elevations on the parkway, the leaves are at their peak. It is really pretty.

It is nice to hike and then go back to a warm, dry place for the night. It rained all last night and the trail was foggy and damp this morning.Today, I am going to complain about the weather. The trail offered the most views in a long time. However, there were few views because of fog. There isn't much I can say about the trail today.This was the rockiest trail I have hiked since I started making up my missed miles..The end of the hike was fun.

NOBOWe checked out early, by first light, of our place at the Royal Oaks to complete this BRP section to Rockfish Gap where I started the Shenandoah National Park section a few weeks ago. As it always seems to happen, after being wet and rainy for our time here, the weather  cleared up for this last day in the area.I had some nice views and saw several rock walls as well as a rock chimney, which are evidence of prior settlement in the area.

Because of this, Reid and I were out the door at 5am to have my car parked and me on the trail by early light. This is the last section of the BRP that I need to complete.It was rainy in morning, then drizzly and cold most of the rest of the day. Once again, there was potential for good views but I didn't see any due to the weather. (I plan to hike this section again when there are views.) The trail can be nice and pretty in cool, damp weather, and it was.At the end of the hike, I crossed over the James River on the longest footbridge on the AT. It is dedicated to a man named Bill Foot. I knew who he was and had hiked with him and his wife in the SNP several years ago. They were a striking couple.I had a fall today that hurt. A root of a bush had been trimmed but was sticking out on the left side of the trail. It must have been covered by leaves. It caught my left foot and tripped me. I fell forward and slightly off the left side of the trail. As I did, I landed on another trimmed root that was sticking straight up and had a circumference of about a nickel. It got me in my chest at my breast area. It took me a minute to get up from that fall! I think I will be sore from it for a while. Cheers!","Apple Orchard Falls

Ahh, Mount Rogers/Grayson Highlands - A Favorite of Mine.I love this area! I have backpacked and hiked it several times in the past. It never disappoints me. It has open areas that give the feel of the West. It has wild ponies that are very friendly. There are numerous signs asking people to keep the ponies wild by not petting or feeding them, but everyone does.Reid hiked a portion of the trail with me, which I always enjoy. We saw lots of weekend backpackers. It was wintry and cold, but we had views.We are staying at the Grayson Highland Inn, which has good accommodations centrally located to these last 3 sections of trail that I need to do. It was nice to be able to get out of the damp and cold after a day of hiking.

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580690,"501.1 - 518.5NOBO I really liked this section of trail (particularly to Fox Creek) and have made a mental note to hike it again.Since the days are shorter, I wanted to be on the trail early. Reid dropped me off at first light at Massie Gap where there was dense fog and strong wind. As I walked up Massie Gap to reach the AT, I looked back at the parking area and saw only 2 headlights glaring through the fog. (Reid said he watched his wife disappear into the cloud.)Once I hit the AT, the trail was better. The trail was set deep into the ground and it was surrounded on both sides by dense bushes that rose higher than my head. Although I could hear the wind roar like a freight train, the bushes blocked the wind. The fog was less dense, too.The forest in this section, at times, reminded me of the forests I saw up north. Parts of it were moss-covered and muddy. There was one long stretch that passed through a high open area where I knew the views would be great, if the fog wasn't hiding them. I felt the wind in this open area, but it had died down some compared to Massie Gap.The trail passed through an area called the ""Scales"", where there are a few plaques telling the history of the highland area. The early pioneers found the area rich with virgin forest, and set up commercial logging . After the logging, farmers moved in and occupied the now open fields. Because of difficult access and a short growing season, the area was used for grazing. At first, cattle would be herded down the mountain for sale, but the cattle would weigh less  by the time they got down. So the Scales area was set up in the mountains where the cattle would be brought for sale at their ""mountain"" weight. In the 1960s, the forest service bought the land. Hardy ponies were introduced to keep the area as open fields for views and recreation.Towards the end of my hike, I had a nice treat. I ran into a SOBO hiker named Spoon, whom I met (along with Skipper) August 12th just across the NH border.  We had share some warm beer together and had a fun time visiting.  (We thought the beer was trail magic but found out it was a Rugby group's cooler waiting to be hauled up the mountain to a party.) We reminisced about that day and laughed. I always wondered if I would run in to him while completing my miles in VA. I thought it was cool that I saw him the 2nd to last day of completing my AT hike. There is something to be said about seeing a fellow hiker that I saw way up north. He could validate, in my mind, that I was truly hiking the trail up north even though I was now hiking down south. He knew I was, in fact, a thru-hiker.Cheers!","Massie Gap (Mount Rogers/Grayson Highlands)

HyLo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580710,"518.5 - 532.6NOBOI had what is called an ""ear-worm"" going through my head during this entire hike. It was the song, ""The Final Countdown"", by Europe. My mind was singing it because  these were my last miles to complete the AT. I also invisioned, and embodied, the energy snd strength of Rocky since that is the movie with which I associate the song. ( I have since found out this is an incorrect association.) The trail was fairly smooth and fast today. It went through a pretty open field and on a bridge over a river. The bridge had an interesting plaque about 3 trout species in the river and what makes them different from each other.  The trail ran over a ridge for a while and then followed a long rhododendron path to the Mount Rogers Visitor Center. There is a very nice shelter close to the center that has a running shower for hikers' use!Reid was waiting for me at the center. We took pictures and celebrated by hugging and kissing. Then left to pick up my truck at Dickey Gap. As we drove into the parking area at Dickey Gap, there was a man sitting on a rock eating cake and a woman taking a picture of him. When I asked if  he was celebrating something, he said he had just completed the trail. (He was a thru-hiker who had hiked the entire trail except a 6-mile section at Dickey Gap. He had gotten off here with an injured fellow hiker, and the person who took him back to the trail dropped him off on another road that caused him to miss this 6-mile section. He and his wife had come all the way from Wisconsin for him to hike these 6 miles so he could be a considered a thru-hiker. His name was Ron and his trail name was Huckleberry.)That started a very fun conversation and long celebration among the four of us. It was much more fun than just picking up my truck and going home. We congratulated each other, celebrated with cold beer that his wife had brought, told stories, laughed, and exchanged names. One of the neatest things about this meeting was that Reid and Huckleberry's wife, Chris, had each other to talk about what it was like to be the support person of a long distance thru-hiker. It was a good bonding experience for both of them.We finally said our goodbyes and left for home. My and Huckleberry's journeys were complete. We accomplished what we had set out to do. We had innumeral and varied experiences. Our spouses were at our sides now and had  been with us to provide support during our incredible journeys. It was a great way to end my hike of the entire Appalachian Trail.Cheers!","Dickey Gap (VA 650)
