Wheatless (currently do not have an official trail name),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570758,"Although I've hiked bits of the trail before, this is the first time that I decided to record it. The goal this time was to hike all of my home state, MD! With a growing interest in section hiking, I want to track things in the event that I am able to complete this. The day went well! After a lot of overtime at work, my manager was okay with me leaving early with a coworker and getting on the trail. There were 4 of use (Brian, Ben, and Mark joined in). We unfortunately did not get onto the trail until 16:30, which did no bode well with the 10 miles we planned to hike. The woods were cloaked in a dark shade for most of it, but anytime we reached a clearing we still enjoyed sunlight. We arrived to the shelter safely about 10 minutes after the last traces of the sun disappeared. Shared a tent with someone. Still not sure if I like tents or hammocks more.","Pen Mar PA

Wheatless (currently do not have an official trail name),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570759,"Today went well. The crew that I am with is pretty beat up after a long hike without having trained up to this point. I'm tired but at the same time feel great all things considering. My pack has never been this light and it is profoundly decreasing the strain of the hike. I also am rocking some lovely wool socks which make so much more of a difference than I ever realized. I had seen so many blogs that talk about how great they are, but was not expecting for my feet to feel dry even after being dumped on by the rain. Yeah...it rained a good amount. We reached the (original) Washington Momentum before it started, so we took up shelter in the spiral stone staircase. After awhile we just gave up and ventured into the torrent since we were burning much more time. It wasn't bad and only lasted a bit, and I can only imagine how much of a strain it puts on a person to deal with rain for awhile. Eventually my wool socks did succumb to the humidity, which made things a bit uncomfortable but I can't complain. I will say that I was definitely struggling as we approached the 20 mile mark. The long incline after passing the Rocky Run shelter was mentally challenging. This leads me to wonder how many miles I will be able to hike at a time in the future. Thru hikers are able to hit 20-30 miles a day due to the conditioning that they receive form repeated days of hiking. It will be tough for me to repeatedly hit that distance in week/weekend trips. Overall I'm doing good. Well hydrated and eating well.","Ensign Cowall

Wheatless (currently do not have an official trail name),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570761,"Left Crampton Gap early to refill water at Gathland State Park and enjoy breakfast. It became a meeting point for many thru-hikers and those out for the weekend, which was fun. I enjoyed talking with one backpacker who was literally hiking home to Maine. One thing I have never had to consider as a short distance backpacker is refilling. The people I meet share there experiences and basic strategies of charting out towns/getting shuttled in which will help with future planning. My group was ready to go home today. I do wonder how I will have the mental stamina to endure more than 2 nights in a row. Physically I don't see any issues, but staying engaged in the trail might be a challenge. The switchbacks down to Weaverton road were kind of a pain, but I got through that all right. And then came the long stretch of straight, flat road known as the C&O canal. I decided to run for about 1/3 of it on and off. I knew I had the energy to reach the end doing this, so it was good endurance training with my backpack on. Eventually I made it to Harper's Ferry, which is such a cool looking town. I will definitely be taking my soon to be wife back here. I hung out at Jefferson Rock, which is where I proposed to her less than a year and a half ago (I'm marrying her in a month!!). I had no idea the point was along the trail at the time, so it was a nice surprise. I hike through about half of WV and got off the trail by route 340, instead walking to the parking lot along shoreline drive.Overall it was a good trip. Some lessons learned:Get wool everything! That stuff is amazing. Good work on the food! Consuming a lot of calories and making sure I was getting good, balanced nutrition made me feel so great.Hiking 20 miles a day constantly as a section hiker probably won't be possible if I am just jumping right back into it after a long break. 10-15 seems more reasonable for me.","Crampton Gap
