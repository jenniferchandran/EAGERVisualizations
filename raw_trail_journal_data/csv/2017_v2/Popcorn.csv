Popcorn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554102,"I have purchased and received all of my gear. Training hike today was 4.8 miles with a pack weight of 38lbs. Pack is filled with rice to add weight and also has 2 liters of water.Base pack weight (no water or food) on a 2014 section hike I came in at 17 lbs. This trip it is coming in at 25 lbs. Increase is due to: heavier backpack (2 lbs), rain gear (1.5 lbs), cookware and first aid kit was carried by another hiker in the earlier hike (3.8 lbs for both), microspikes (0.9 lbs), and luxury items (4.2 lbs). Some of the weight increase was offset with a lighter tent and quilt. Hope to offload about 5 lbs of winter gear before Waynesboro, Va. This will get me to about 20 lbs base weight; not great but should be manageable. In order to reduce weight further, I would need to go with a lighter stove and reduce some luxury items (10,000 maH battery pack, camp shoes, and camera.) Of course a lighter backpack would help, but this one is so comfortable. Plan is to make pack item adjustments on trail if needed.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Fri",4.80
Popcorn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554237,"A 5 mile training hike today at about a 2.5 mph pace. Humidity was 100% (misting) and temperature was in low 70s. Before the hike, I took out all of the rice that I was using for ballast and added my actual trail gear. My base weight went up to 26 lbs before adding 11.5 lbs of rice and 2 liters of water (4.4 lbs). Total weight came in about 42 lbs, but felt no different than the 38 lbs total I had on the earlier hikes. Not proud of a 26 lb base weight, but believe I can manage it, especially when I send home 5 lbs of winter gear later in the AT hike. Lost one of the platypus 1 liter containers during the hike. This has happened before with my old pack, but seems easier to occur with the new pack ( Atmos AG 65).   The pockets for water bottles do not totally wrap around a full 1 liter platypus container. When you bend down, in order to not hit your head on a limb, this causes the container to be pointed down, causing it to slip out of the pack. I will see what I can do on the next training hike to diminish the chance of this occurring. Can't be loosing my water containers on the AT.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Mon",0

Popcorn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554539,"Fridays are the longer training hikes. Today we did about 13 miles and averaged 2 mph, including breaks. Unfortunately, elevation changes were only about 200 ft. Of course the pack felt heavier on the limited uphills, especially at the 10 mile mark. Would like to reduce some pack weight, but my strategy is to wait until the 3rd week of hiking on the AT to make adjustments. I find that the first two weeks are all training and gaining strength with a lot of sore muscles. However, after the third week, the body has less pain and is starting to feel real good. Of course this is based on prior experience with a 19 lb base weight and not my current 26 lb base weight. As the saying goes, after a 1000 miles it doesn't matter how much your pack weighs.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Fri",0

We all registered at the park, and I'm thru Hiker number #141 for 2017.

However there was a man with his daughter behind me, I said ""Katie""? She said yes and this is my father. Katie and I were introduced by a guy on her volleyball team that also subscribes to TexAgs ( A Texas A&M online forum mainly for sports). I had posted in the outdoors section to see if any other Alumni were hiking the AT. A guy named Matt responded that he did know of a person starting the same day, named Katie.

First time I have listed to the music I downloaded to my phone before the trip. Both Sarge and Stix had purchased sodas for Mary Kay and I, so this was a treat when we first got to the Shelter. Maybe last time to see some of the hikers (Hobo and Stix), as they plan to do more miles and skip sections Stix completed last year. Great chatting with people around the fire, didn't get to bed until 10 pm, too many Mountain Dews.
