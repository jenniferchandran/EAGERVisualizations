Sparks and Bushy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545887,"We are Mike (Sparks) and Bushy (Bushy) Hartman and we attempted to hike the Appalachian Trail in March of 2015, but quit only after one week. 


We plan on giving it another go March, 14th, 2017! This time with lighter / leaner bodies and packs. We learned a lot on the first go around and hopefully we can turn those lessons learned into a successful thru hike; starting over from Springer Mountain. We are retired (truly retired!) and getting older, so we figure that if we do not do it now, we will NEVER do it. My trail name is from mine and Bushy's Navy days, as a former Radiomen. The emblem for the Radioman was sparks. Bushy's trail name is a name that she received back in the day by friends because of her bushy hair plus, she cannot stand her given name...maybe given trail magic, she will reveal her real name. :-) Hiking the Appalachian Trail has always been on our ""bucket lists"" so here we are…again! Bushy is 61 and is a native of Florida/Maryland and I am 65 and am a native of California/Arizona. We both are very excited about getting back on the trail and after much research and trail journal reading, and lessons learned from our first attempt, we will be lightening our loads considerably. Hope to see you on the trail! 
This will be us again, just lighter and leaner…but this time to completion!!!",,WE ARE BACK!!,"Aug 19, Fri",0
Sparks and Bushy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546392,"We let everyone know that we are going to take another shot at the Appalachian Trail! So, we are locked in! :-) We plan on starting in March of 2017. This time we plan on being leaner and lighter; we have already lost 17 pounds each and are walking between 2-5 miles a day, and just recently added carrying our packs (not fully loaded yet) :-) We learned a lot on the last hike and we know better what not to take this time so it should lighten our packs considerably! Plus, we have more time to lose the extra weight that we are carrying on our bodies. :-) An additional tool in our tool belt is that we have started Tai Cheng Tai Chi, which should help us with our focus, balance, and muscles (might gives us some...ha ha ha)!",,Pre-Hike Workout Update 21 Aug 2016,"Aug 21, Sun",0
Sparks and Bushy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546613,"We are now hiking 5 miles each day, and have started incorporating our backpacks, very light at first (Bushy's - 10 lbs., mine - 9 lbs.), and will build up slowly. We have a perfect lake environment with plenty of beautiful surroundings, complete with loads of rolling hills!! Oh, did I mention that the weather is in the 80's and 90's, with humidity up to 96 percent...which makes for a very hot and wet walk (even early in the mornings)!!

We have lost 20 lbs. each so far, and have started hiking five miles a day with 11 to 12 pounds in our packs; tomorrow, we will add the tent to increase the load (tent in one and poles in the other pack). I got the Sawyer 3 way inline water filter for the platypus, I just need to hook it up. We have all of the bills on auto pay, so no worries there. :-) Now, we just need to purchase a few last minute items such as another sleeping bag, a platypus, some more darn tough socks, and a few food items that we can take with us the first week.We think that we can cut the number of drop boxes by half…along with the load of stuff in them!We are going to rent a car with Enterprise (they come and get us), and see if we can drop it off at the Blue Ridge, GA location and get them to take us to the trail head…if not, we will just coordinate a shuttle pick up.Well, class of 2017, see you on the trail soon!!!",,Pre-Hike Workout Update 11 Sep 2016,"Sep 11, Sun",0

We are going to add to our mileage starting tomorrow, still with the 20 lb. packs, to start getting closer to our 10 mile a day goal.We volunteered for a Trail Maintenance crew on the 1st of October for about 4 miles of the Apalachicola Nation Forest (Hwy 329 – FR 321) section, for the Florida Trail Association (FTA). See photo of Bushy and I with the other trail maintenance crew volunteers below:  Bushy and I with the other volunteers of the trail maintenance crew Then, on the 8th, we hiked a four mile section of the High Bluff Coastal Hiking Trail in Tate’s Hell State Forest, again with the FTA, that included an interpretive guide!

Sparks and Bushy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550528,"Thanks to Debra, from Texas, and her post to our guestbook, we would like to share our lessons learned from our first attempt in 2015, along with how we plan on factoring them into our next hike.Lessons Learned :I wished we had: - Trained longer; this go around, we will have 8 months to train (vice only two) and we have more realistic surroundings to train in, including hills with steep inclines, and local Florida trails that provide more of a challenge than the flat terrain of Slidell, LA. We have also joined the Florida Trail Association to help us get more guidance, suggestions, etc., while we also have an opportunity to volunteer for some trail maintenance activities. - Known about the hiker hunger not kicking in the first week, it would have saved carrying so much food to be just given away in the end. This time we are taking less food and doing less mail drops (only to key locations)…going from about 32 mail drops to about 10, and incorporating a bounce box, with things like toenail clippers, extra meds, etc., that you we do not want to carry.- Where the sections of the trail were that were lacking in water sources such as Sassafras Mountain. This time we will plan for more water capacity, such as a platypus 2-liter and two smart 1-liter bottles each…we will only fill the platypus(s) when and where we need it. - Not taken the Surface tablet and all of the cables that came with it. This time we are just using the iPhones for journal entries, as well as the photography; we do plan on taking an Innergie PocketCell Plus 6,000 mAh battery bank with us.We were not sorry that Bushy took the Nikon D80 camera because we got some fantastic photos! However, we have changed to iPhone 7’s which have better cameras built in (as well as more storage capacity) and might get the telephoto/wide angle lens attachment for one of them. Also, as an addition to our training, we have added Tai Cheng Tai Chi to our daily regiment; this is helping a lot with our balance and body range of motion. Between the walking and the Tai Chi, we both have lost 30 lbs. of body weight, which is 30 lbs. less that we have to carry on the trail…and have converted it to muscle. We were happy in how well our legs and feet stood up to the conditions, so the Chi walking and warm up (we did this every morning before we hiked, and still do); we only used Motrin the last night out after the ten miler. We did not have any blisters because we used toe-socks, shoes that promoted tightening of the heel, Sparks used toe sleeves, purchased in Walmart, for preventing the big toe from rubbing the next toe, and most of all, Glide or Gold Bond chaffing product (it looks like a deodorant stick that you put on hot spots and heels before you hike). It can also be used for “monkey butt” or chaffing thighs and other places. And, most importantly, this time, we are BOTH in the right mindset to hike the Appalachian Trail, vice only one of us! Last time, Bushy was in the proper mindset, but I (Sparks) was not. Additionally, from a mental aspect, we have also gotten back into our meditation practice, and listen to guided meditations that we downloaded for free from DharmaSeed.org. I’m sure that there will be more as we go along because we are constantly reading other’s Trail Journals, and articles, trying to learn as much as we can to make this a successful thru-hike!",,Lessons Learned from 2015 Attempt,"Oct 16, Sun",0

Sparks and Bushy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551010,"Bushy and I drove three and a half hours to Jacksonville, just so we could go to an REI. It was well worth it!! The backpack and shoe staff were very knowledgeable and super helpful. We learned how to adjust our packs so they would fit better, by using a Deuter ACT 50 + 10 pack they had there...it was sooooo much lighter than my existing Deuter pack! We learned that the new Deuters are at least a pound lighter than the ones we have! Needless to say, a couple of days after we got home we ordered new packs from REI (Deuter ACT 50 + 10 for me and a Deuter ACT SL 45 + 10 for Bushy). :-) We also learned about the differences in the Superfeet inserts, and the young lady there in the Shoe department helped us pick out just the ones that we both needed; I found that the Copper one had the most support for the heel (where I have been having problems) and the Berry one helped Bushy with support of her instep. She then instructed me on how to tie my shoes so that it would prevent synching up the toe box (which was bothering one of my big toes)…totally worth the trip to Jacksonville! Of course, there was a Cheesecake Factory right there nearby, so we had to stop for lunch and indulged in a Macaroni Cheeseburger and a hot fudge sundae (which we shared) YUMMMY and totally worth the calories!! lol
 The yummy macaroni cheeseburger! 
We also got the new Snow Peak Giga Power and cups loaded into our packs, along with about six days of Mountain House meals that we still had from our previous hike, into our packs, so all that we have in our packs now is stuff that we plan on taking on the trail with us, except the sleeping bags and thermarest pads…they will go in later when we get Bushy’s new Enlightened Revelation down quilt. This should bring us up to about 25 pounds, including the two liters of water that we are each carrying. We think that once we get our final weight down we might be able to add back in our Helinox One chairs, as our luxury items! :-o

The ACT Lites are one pound lighter but the Futura’s have the webbing and air flow for the back instead of two gigantic pads that feel like they are poking you in the back. Plus, the Futura’s have the zipper opening on the back of the pack, light a suitcase, whereas the ACT Lite’s only have a stretchy pocket, that is open to the elements.

One gentleman at Mountain Crossings showed Bushy his thumb and it looked like frost bite. We did really well with the cold, with base layer bottoms, fleece top, puffy coat, and rain jacket. We picked up our mail drop along with the Igneo mummy bags, that we had sent from home and REI. Now, we should be warm! Regardless of the added weight, we will keep both the Igneos and EE Quilts, so that we will be warm through the Smokies! We got a room at the Seasons Inn, Blairsville, GA, and then had to find a shuttle to get to it. No shuttles were available, so someone suggested that we could hitch there pretty easily, so Bushy pulled out our ""Hiker to Town"" banner and we stood out by the entrance to Mountain Crossings and in a matter of minutes, this nice gentleman (former AT hiker; trail name Hunan) stopped. He had a car full of other hikers in the car but they all made room for us! How cool was that!!! The Seasons Inn is really nice, and they had free hot chocolate in the Lobby...mmmm good!

Wow! Last night was cold and noisy! The tents were practically stacked on top of each other! When we got there, we set up next to Right Leg, and then someone setup a hammock right next to us! Between the snoring, passing gas, and mid-night pee breaks, it was pretty noisy! :-o ah, but we were sooooo much warmer with our mummy bags and quilts!! Low Gap shelter was really bad; although they had two places to hang bear bags, there was only one for all the tenters (and there were a boat load of them!) It was a long and miserable walk to the privy (up a hill) and to the water source! The privy was almost full! Ewww. Anyway, we woke up and packed everything, but first I had to walk down and get more water, and the food bags, quite a hike in itself. Got all packed up and off we went. Beautiful sunrise:

We were soooo glad to finally get to the road at Unicoi Gap!!!

We waited for Forest and then we started to hitch to Hiawassee (Bushy got out our handy dandy Hiker to Town banner). After a few minutes, a young gentleman (Cory (brother of Ken with the brown beard), who had a beautiful Weimaraner; her name was Willow) walked over from his truck in the parking lot and offered us a ride! 
 Cory and Willow 
We put all the packs in the back and Forrest and myself climbed in with them, and Willow, Bushy rode in the front where she really enjoy her conversation with this wonderful young man. He drove us to the Holiday Inn in Hiawassee! He was such a nice young man!! So, we are going to Nero here tonight and zero here tomorrow (our bodies need a rest and we want to celebrate our getting to the place where we quit in 2015, but are NOT quitting this time)!! Tonight, we went to Daniel's Steak House (all you can eat), and Bushy could ONLY eat one piece of chicken!! We will have to try again tomorrow! :-) We are sooooo fortunate!! 
We also wanted to mention our first time witnessing true trail magic (Bushy totally flipped out, sorta like seeing a leprechaun) while taking a much needed break, up walks Forrest and then Indiana Jay, he asked if any of us were from NY, Forrest was, whereby Indiana pulls out a knit cap he found about two miles back, it belonged to Forrest!

We lucked out and found a flat tent site, loved it! Today was a long and miserable hike!

We hiked from Painters Branch Camp Site (242.4) to Roaring Fork Shelter (255.5) for a total of 13.1 miles, which included Max Patch! To look at AWOL it didn't appear to us to be a hard day.....big mistake! We spent the day going up and down with some very steep ups! We took several breaks sitting in our chairs to rest our backs. The last few days have been over ten miles so we hope to do just ten miles tomorrow. The bubble we are in is Yoda, Brooklyn, Bisquick, and a few others. Tonight we will sleep in the shelter since all the campsites are slanted. The highlight of the day was Max Patch; after a grueling climb, we had a magnificent view!! There is a hyper chipmunk here hoping he doesn't visit tonight.

It had a cascading waterfall behind it and a beautiful view in front of it, and we had it all to ourselves . :-) We had time to soak our feet in the stream and then pull out our chairs and just enjoy the view!! Never got more sleep; the only thing that we heard was the waterfall! The hike today was beautiful, the smell of pine, and the beauty of the flowers were fantastic! At one mountain top we laid out the tent footprint because Bushy's tailbone was hurting (she had a fall that landed her on her tailbone on a rock a couple of days earlier), and we just laid there enjoying the clouds go by; it was very relaxing!

Up from Taylor Hollow Gap and then Deer Park Mountain (they don't look that ominous in AWOL but they kicked our butts!) :-o. Then it was finally down hill, and down, and down, and down! Again the fragrance of pine saturated the air as we hiked, Bushy says if we lived here she would plant this variety of pine in our yard and leave the windows wide open. We finally got to Laughing Heart Hostel, and in only three and a half hours! The Hostel was very nice, they hurried and cleaned our room and let us in early! We quickly took much needed showers and the walked down to the Smoky Mountain Diner for lunch. Yum!! We also checked out the General Dollar store right next door and picked up some flip flops (camp shoes), new Smart One bottles, duct tape (need more on my ink pen holders; the rest of the roll goes in the hiker box), and some snacks for the room. What we also noted they were totally out of sides and no Ramen noodles, glad we had a mail drop.

We found that the Dollar General was nearly wiped out of hiker supplies but found the Hillbilly Market has a massive amount of hiker supplies, reasonably priced. They also sell sandwiches, milkshakes, hot breakfast foods, pizza, chicken and biscuit, there was just so much I can't remember it all. They open at 7:00 on weekdays and 8:00 on weekends.

Plus, we got the room right next to the bathroom, and across from the washer and dryer, so constant traffic and noise! Did I mention that the dryer wasn't vented to the outside, just behind the dryer. Oh, and Bushy had to fold their laundry before we could get ours into the dryer. :-(. Anyway, we are out of Hot Springs, and it was a hellacious climb out of there! But, the view, half way up, was beautiful! It was a pretty cool walk today, and it even sprinkled a little bit.

The trail was wet, muddy and slippery, and we started uphill (as usual), steep incline (Little Bald). Upon reaching the ridge wind whipped the cold rain into our faces, but we soldiered on, through boulder scrambles. We hiked trough some massive boulders. Then, coming down it was very flat, just slippery, and would have been a perfect hiking trail if it wasn't for the rain. Further down we went through a section that was like an enchanted forest, with green lush mossy covered boulders, it was absolutely beautiful! Then we decided to pull out our chairs and take a break by a mini-waterfall, because it stopped raining, we were able to take off our rain gear, and continued on. The closer we got to the shelter, the AWOL said that there was a piped stream just before it; not so.

Oh, and about 7:15am just after sunrise we are hiking the trail at a good clip not talking, focused on our pace and footing. The trail is about a little over a foot wide, and on our left is the steep mountain rising to the top, on our right a steep decline to the valley below, there are fewer plants on the left the right pretty lush with rhododendrons. All of a sudden we hear a loud crashing and I saw a round ball of fur come rolling down from the mountain, across the trail about ten feet in front of us, and on down the mountain. Awesome!!! Bushy tried to get me to move up so we might see what it was but I thought if it was a baby bear, momma may follow! :-o
We heard that the hostel was a party hostel, but we have learned that it is pretty laid back and accommodating. So far, we are not seeing any signs of partying. They have three free shuttles a day for guests into town, and Shuttle Bunny (the shuttle driver) is awesome! We decided to replace Bushy's Zpacks pack with an Osprey Atmos 50 AG (Anti-Gravity) and we compared Uncle Johnny's price with REI, and they were the same. We were pleasantly surprised, because you would expect inflated prices along the trail, but they were not. Anyway, the Zpacks pack was very uncomfortable to Bushy and even causing back pain. :-( The new Osprey might be heavier but at least it will be comfortable. Can't hike the trail if your pack is causing you pain! 
The shuttle took us to the laundromat (the hostel's laundry facilities were backlogged) and then was kind enough to swing back and pick us up. :-) Then, we caught the evening shuttle to dinner and Walmart. Awesome meal at Los Jalapeños! We supplemented our mail drop with a few items at Walmart...not sure why we did a mail drop here because we could have just resupplied at Walmart. :-/
Charla (Uncle Johnny's wife), Uncle Johnny , and Gary have been very accommodating, helping Bushy with her pack fitting and answering our many questions.

The trail was in great condition with oh so many ups and downs. Water was scarce today with only one watering hole that you had to dip for water. The next one is just before Vandeventer which is a half mile down an extremely steep ravine, take a walking pole.
 It was like we hiked all around the lake. At US 321 we had to take the blue blaze around the flooded section by the lake. The wind was fierce nearly blowing Bushy over while walking over the Dam, since her pack cover kept catching the wind like a parachute!

8:30 we were walking down through the town and following those white blazes since the trail went thru the town. We got to say hey to Doc, he came out when we passed by, they slack packed so now are far ahead of us when they return to the trail. Slack packing is when a hiker stays at a hostel or B&B and they catch a shuttle to a trail head then hike back carrying only a small backpack with water, lunch, and jacket. They hike back to the place they are staying and stay another night. Some hostels even arrange with another hostel down the line so the hiker can hike to a trail head near them and they pick them up, the first hostel transfers the backpacks to the next hostel of course for a fee. Some people don't agree with this method since many times this lets the hiker go downhill on big mountains instead of climbing them. We don't care, for us the benefits are less people on the trail, more campsites available to us. :-). We personally will not slack pack, we want to have the full experience and we are in no hurry.
This was our first day with our new packs and Bushy finally said she was truly happy. Jeff at Mt Rodgers outfitters sold her the right size and showed her how to properly wear it. He said he would never of sold the men's small to her it wasn't the right size. Jeff even showed me how to wear the one Bushy first bought that is my size. Today I wore it but I have to take more time tweaking the straps and I think it will work.
The trail was the usual up and downs but the rocks on the trail beat up our feet something awful. Lots of water, and the rapids looked so pretty and powerful! They stock that river with trout so Bushy made note of this for when we come back in the motorhome. The Creeper trail runs by here and many take that instead of the AT since it is so pretty. I didn't appreciate the bikes whizzing by, driven by folks who haven't ridden a bike in years, so when the AT split back to itself we stayed on it.
It was such pretty weather but windy and chilly. Now we are here in our sleeping bags, snuggled down with our feet wrapped in our puffy jackets, we will be fine.","Damascus, VA

Today we hiked from Lost Mountain Shelter (485.0) to a campsite past Thomas Knob Shelter (498.0) for a total of 13 miles, this included Whitetop Mountain (5087 ft.).  

View from Whitetop Mountain 
The trail started out very nice and we past a pasture of cows; one of them started heading our way so we decided to move on. Then we passed a patch of older pine trees with a swath of Pink Lady Slippers, a type of wild rare orchid. We crossed VA 601 and began the long, and I mean long climb up Whitetop Mountain. The trail consisted of switchbacks making the climb easier but it took about an hour or more, with high gusts and temps in the 30's. We finally stopped for a sit down break at 11:30, but only fifteen minutes because of the cold. Around 1:00 we came out to a road (VA 601) where Bob and Bulldog were having trail magic of hamburgers and hotdogs; what a great surprise! We ate a burger and a home made brownie, and drank a soda, while chatting with Duck tape, Bambi, Rockstar, and their gang. We had to keep going there was four more miles to do. We climbed up the Bald with Duct Tape and the wind just blew us around. We finally entered the tree line making hiking a little better. We finally get to the shelter that has had a fake facade put on it and new metal roof, which doesn't appear to have helped the rodent problem; Bushy saw a mouse run across the back of it and we decided to just get water and go find a campsite a little further up the trail. While getting water the ponies came up to us, even the two babies!  They are so friendly! Further up the trail we found a clearing to put up our tents and Duct Tape starts calling to us to come see what she found when she went to relieve herself behind a pine tree, a huge horned steer!

He seemed cool with us in his pasture but did mooo when Sparks went to hang the bear bag. The night had winds so high the tent kept bowing the tent poles, making quite a noise all night then just before dawn it started raining.","Lost Mountain Shelter

We got up 6:00 bright and early and packed our stuff and hit the trail. About twenty feet away from our tent was the steer, laying down. We hiked from our campsite past Thomas Knob Shelter (498.0) to Old Orchard Shelter (509.2) for a total of 11.2 miles. What a hike! We hiked through Fatman Squeeze (I almost missed it, but Bushy caught it); how cool!! 

Fatman Squeeze
Then we hike into Grayson Highlands where we saw the ponies! This was a must do on our hike and we loved getting so close but not touching the ponies. 

Ponies

Baby Pony 

Looking to see what I had
On the way to see the ponies Bushy slipped on a wet rock that was about 12 inches high. She fell amongst other equally big rocks and was pinned until I lifted her up; her arms were twisted up, and with the pack, she couldn't raise herself.  Thankfully, she only has a scrape and now bruised leg, nothing major and her right shoulder is sore.Oh, and during all of this, we crossed our 500 mile mark!! 

500 Miles!We stopped at Wise shelter where there are now two privies. We met four very nice young men and talked a while. This was just what Bushy needed, last night, around 8:15 pm this group of rowdy Twenty something's came into the meadow we camped in and started yelling and talking about inappropriate topics. They got up after us this morning and must of disturbed the steer because we heard it bawling and saw it running down the mountain. We stopped at Old Orchard Shelter, which had a nice tent spot just past it, and hung a line to dry the sleeping bags and thermarests from last night's rains. And, Sparks cooked Bushy a cup of tea to help soothe her cold (she did the same for me earlier with my cold) and we just chilled in our chairs. Bushy then took our pant legs down to the stream and washed them and now they are drying.","Campsite past Thomas Knob Shelter (498.0)

Hiked from Old Orchard Shelter (509.2) to Trimpi Shelter (522.6) for a total of 13.4 miles. In the morning, it looked like it was going to rain so we donned our rain gear, however, it got too hot so we took it back off again. We met Grateful 2, who was coming from the south. He told us that he and a fellow hiker devised a plan for key swapping. One drives the other to the trail head and drops him off, then drives to the opposite end of that trail section, parks the car, and then hikes toward the other one; somewhere in the middle they swap the keys so the other one can drive back and pick up the other.  Very innovative way to hike the trail!  We stopped at Comers Creek, which had a very nice cascade, and ate lunch; fantastic!  The weather started out gloomy and windy but improved as the day went on with sunny skies and warm temperatures. The trail started out with fabulous soft packed dirt and flat, ah but that didn't last for long, soon we were doing a climb. Later in the day rocks appeared in some places but in other parts they are removing the rocks and we appreciate so much all their hard work. The forest here is so green and the rhododendrons are just starting to bloom, there are few wildflowers blooming yet. There was so many streams with cold clear water but once we crossed Comer Cascades it became very arid not a stream did we cross. It isn't recommended that you use the Comer Cascades for drinking and we started the day with two liters of water each, by the time we reached Trimpi shelter we had a swig left. There is a nice water source here at the shelter but it is .1 mile off the trail.","Old Orchard Shelter

We made it five minutes before the bus arrived! Wooo woooo!! We rode the transit to Travel Inn, where we are neroing and zeroing. According to AWOL, this was the only place that had laundry facilities, plus, Walmart is within walking distance! :-). While hiking today we saw our first salamander! Actually, three of them, Bushy even picked one up and moved it off the trail so it wouldn't get stepped on!

We were so fortunate to get Trail Angels Jim & Carrie Sparks to pick us up at the hotel and take us back to the trailhead for free! Thank you so much Jim & Carrie! You helped us so much!! It would have been very difficult to hitch back to the trailhead on Mothers Day!!

Then, when we got on the trail, we felt very good after our rest; we were over our colds and very energized, and we planned on making big miles today...then the rocks appeared!! Everywhere, rocks!! We were trying to hurry so that we could make it to the Barn for their famous burger, but it was Sunday and they closed at two. :-(. When we finally got to the old school house (Linda mood School), we started smelling burgers on the grill; we thought that we were imagining it, but no it was real!! There was trail magic being offered by the West End United Methodist church group, with hotdogs, burgers, Mountain Dew, fruit, cobbler, potato salad, and fruit! If was the BEST trail Magic ever!! These trail angels even had all kinds of trail magic inside the school that hikers could take with them! How great they all were!!

When we got to Atkins, we pulled into the Mexican restaurant and got a super burrito to take with us for dinner! :-). It was a fantastic day, nice and cool, sunny, and lots of beauty all around us!

We even saw an Indigo Bunting bird! It was so blue!! Also, two deer shot across the trail in front of us; one even stopped to check us out first!
The streams were high, and remember all of them rocks before?? Well, a few of them could have been used to help cross the streams! Lol. Needless to say, our shoes and feet got soaked. :-(

With the sky beginning to brighten we started packing up our tent, about 5:30. We watched the sun crest the horizon as we tackled our first climb with five more to follow. The forest is so green and lush we do enjoy looking up thru the tall trees and seeing the blue sky peeking around those new bright green leaves. The trail was fantastic with most being hard packed soil with less rocky or muddy parts. We hiked from Campsite at 546.1 to Lynn Camp Creek Campsite (560.1) for a total of 14 miles. 
We crossed some private lands, pastures some occupied with cows and a few cute calves.

Between these pasture lands are roads so we put up our chairs for a nice lunch break. We met ""10"", Goalie, and Voice, or now Scratches during our break and they were so much fun to talk with, I do hope to see them later down the trail.

We also saw Puzzles and Tyler; we seem to walk the same pace but they start later in the day and hike longer.

We have noticed the poison oak is everywhere in the lower elevations, so using the Wet Ones with alcohol to prevent an outbreak..Water is still abundant in some places but not everywhere so be sure to check the book and be overly cautious by carrying enough. We filter our water with the Sawyer squeeze and also using Aquamira since there are so many livestock around the water sources you have to be extra careful. Also the AWOL warns some streams should not be used; be sure to check.We stopped at the Knot Maul Branch shelter for a break and saw ""10"", Goalie and Scratches, they were also taking a break; they were going another nine miles, must be nice to be young. The book says the shelter doesn't have water but it does. We snacked and headed to the predetermined campsite and set up for the night.

We hiked up to Chestnut Knob Shelter; it was a heck of a climb that took about two hours, but the view from up there was awesome! The shelter has four walls and a door. There must be some bad winds at times because the roof is attached to the walls with cables. Some hikers who stayed there said the windows only open so far making it stuffy to sleep there. Also the privy has a beehive inside!

We thought that after Chestnut Mountain it would be a smooth walk; not! The trail was a bunch of PUDs (Pointless Ups & Downs), with more ups than downs! There were boulders to hop and climb. Plus, it was pretty warm, and getting warmer. 
When we took a rest at Walker Gap, Cantaloupe (the mom of Bags) pulled up and was waiting to pick up Bags and his crew to finish slack packing, and she brought us down some trail magic; tangerines and candy, then she provided us with some bottled water, and took our trash. So very nice!!

 By the time we got to VA 623, we were wore out! 
And then we saw the sign for St. Luke's Hostel, and we made the call! It is a fantastic hostel; they serve a home cooked dinner for only $10, and offers bacon & waffles breakfast in the morning. The bed is very comfortable with such nice soft sheets and thick pillows. They also allow you to use their washer and dryer.

The weather was nice and cool. We stopped at the Jenkins Shelter for lunch and ran into Scratches. Plus, we met Snail and Plain Pete. At Laurel Creek, since we got there so quickly, and since there seemed to be a shortage of water from Laurel Creek to the next shelter (which was 12 miles away), we decided to pull into Bland, VA instead (it was only 10 miles away). So, we put it into ""going to town mode"" and kicked it into high gear! :-). We arrived at highway 52 at about 5:00 PM, and ran into ""10"", who was looking for her brother Scratches.  She told us about the Big Walker Motel, and how it was across from Dairy Queen! Right away, we got on the phone to make reservations, because we were drooling over the idea of having a milkshake!!  Plus, she told us about Comfortably Numb, who was giving shuttle rides to Bland for free!

Although it wasn't raining, our pants still got soaked because of all the moisture on the plants, from the overnight rain. We were about 3000 feet up and below us in the valley was a heavy cloud cover that we could see over by the power lines.

The Kimberling Creek suspension bridge was pretty cool, and afforded us some beautiful views of the Creek. By the time we got to VA 606 (road that leads to Trent's Grocery), our pants were dry. Since we hadn't eaten breakfast yet, we opted to hike the half a mile to Trent's Grocery. :-). They were very nice and we got scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast. Plus, they had a machine that made either cappuccino or hot chocolate! So, we got a couple of cappuccinos...yum!! We sat at one of the inside tables, next to a bunch of nice gentlemen (very friendly). We inhaled the breakfast, then ordered a ham & cheese sandwich to pack out for lunch; along with some candy bars, donuts, banana, chips, and Mountain Dews! :-p
Then we hoofed it back to the trail.

We hiked to Dismal Falls and after checking out the Falls, Bushy convinced me to change into my shorts and go swimming! I almost killed myself jumping from the top of the Falls because the moss on the rocks was so slippery. Luckily, I just bruised my heal. Wow, that water was cold!!! Ah, but very refreshing!! Bushy and I cooled our feet in the water and then ate our lunch from Trent's Grocery. A very enjoyable respite!!

Even though it didn't rain, we still got soaked walking through all the wet foliage, and the wind blowing more moisture from the trees. :-(.

We had to pull into WoodsHole because we had a mail drop sent there. When we got there all they had left was bunks in the bunk room, so we took it. Wanderer, a work for stay, gave us a great tour. We then showered and got into loaner clothes (pajama bottoms and various shirts). Then we put our laundry into the provided laundry bag and gave it to the Hostel owners, who did all the laundry. The upstairs bunk room was nice, and warmer than downstairs. They had cookie bars, crackers, and sodas for sale. They even offered smoothies (for $6.00).

Before we ate, the Hostel owner had us all form a circle and hold hands (not my first choice before eating...holding some other hiker's hands...ewww!), she had a moment of silence and the asked each of us to state our names, where we were from , and one thing that we were thankful for. Then, everyone got a plate with eggs, ground sausage, French toast covered in yogurt, and a piece of watermelon, along with orange juice and or coffee. Since there wasn't a lot of room at the table inside, Bushy and I sat at a table out on the porch. The breakfast was delicious! Before we ate, the owner informed us that after breakfast we all needed to perform one chore (jar in bunkhouse had clothes pins with the chores written on them), plus, we had to strip our mattresses and bring the sheet and pillowcase back to the main house, and put the new sheet and pillowcase on; plus the one chore. :-o. Bushy and I did our chores, shocked as we were, and then I went to settle up. When they told me the price I was shocked again...$18 each to stay in a bunkhouse, and have chores (one of the chores was to clean the toilet)! I told them that we were not work for stays, and the last time I cleaned a toilet was back in the Navy! The owner was gracious enough to give us a discount and that we didn't have to do the chores; too late, the chores were done. Anyway, be aware of this request before you decide to stay they don't tell you when you arrive. I must say it is a nice establishment very clean and organized. They also made it clear they are more interested in older customers.

We bought a micro fiber twin sheet set last night from Walmart, for only $5.00, and plan on using it for our sleep system now that it has gotten warmer. The fitted sheet wraps over our two thermarest pads perfectly, and then we can use the flat sheet for covering. I kept my mummy bag because the temperature has dipped back into the 60's; worst case, we can both use it for cover if necessary. Later, I will send my mummy bag to our son also. We plan on picking our winter gear back up from our son when we get up to NY. Bushy also ditched the brain from her backpack. We then walked over to the mini-outfitters they have here. We looked for Permethrin, which they didn't have in Walmart, but the outfitters didn't have it either. After that we all went to lunch. We got some Shoe Goo and I put it all around the soles of Bushy's trail runners; these New Balance Minimus trail runners are not holding up too well. :-(.

The trail started out pretty nice, packed dirt and in some parts the wonderful trail maintainers removed rocks; thank you! There was a section of road walking, with a protective barrier and you go down stairs to pass under the freeway. Then the trail became rocks, the kind that are embedded and make the feet twist and turn. Water was in several locations; some actually running down the trail, so we climbed large rocks to get around it.
Luckily, Bushy suggested that we stop earlier at Rice Field Shelter for a hot Mountain House meal for lunch (usually we have the Mountain House for dinner), so we wouldn't have to cook when we got to the campsite; she is one smart cookie!!  Mmmmm, cookies!!!  Oh, back to the journal. Lol

Today we got packed up before it started to rain. There was a good possibility that our tent was set up on top of some poison ivy or oak, so, after packing up the tent we both wiped our hands off with a wet wipe.  Again, it was wet and misty most of the way, with numerous PUDs (Pointless Ups & Downs), but this time with lots of rocks. We crossed paths with Grateful2 again and after we moved on, Bushy and I got to thinking more about the key swap idea that he had, and we called him to tell him that we were interested.  We need to start picking up some miles, and unless we do some slack packing, I don't think that I (Sparks) will make it to Katahdin. So, we only hiked from Campsite at 649.2 to Stoney Creek Valley parking lot off of VA 635 (655.0) for a total of 5.8 miles, because that would put us at the same as Grateful 2, so we can all proceed together from this point; the intent is to start doing twenty mile days. 
We also ran into Wanderer and she hiked with us down to the parking lot; very nice young lady.  She too was interested in the slack packing idea with Grateful 2.  
As you can see in the photo, while walking with Wanderer, we came across a beautiful salamander! 
When we got to the parking lot we had no signals to our cell phone.  After a bit, Wanderer walked down the street a little ways and didn't find cell service, but did run into Michael Brown who offered to let all of us use his phone; what a fantastic guy, he even offered us sodas while we were there. Grateful 2 was going to come pick us up after he finished his hike, but that wouldn't be until 6:00 PM, so we called a shuttle to take us back to Pearisburg.  The Plaza Motel didn't have any vacancies, so we called the Holiday Motor Lodge; they had a room.  We showered and wash the clothes again, and are just chilling until we can meet up again with Grateful 2 to plan how we will proceed.","Campsite at 649.2

Today we zeroed in Pearisburg so that we could work out the logistics of our new hiking strategy with Grateful 2; he showed me how to plug in the coordinates to each of the upcoming trailheads, into his truck's GPS.  We planned our hikes all the way to Daleville, VA (728.1), hiking between 17-21 miles per day, slack packing. :-) Then, he let me drive his truck to Walmart and back, to get used to it. Since we are going to be slack packing, we picked up a few extra food items to keep in the truck, including a couple of Monster Coffees! :-p. So, we are all ready to hit the trail bright and early tomorrow. The highlight of the day was to meet Trail Mom and Mr. Trail Mom!! (See photo). They were at the Plaza Motel giving out trail magic. They are truly special people!!","

Today was our first slack packing day and our first 21 miler!! We hiked from Stoney Creek Valley parking lot off of VA 635 (655.0) to VA 630 (676.5) for a total of 21.5 miles. It was excruciating, two mountains and lots of rocks to walk across! Even young people were complaining about the rocks. It was a nice day otherwise. Bushy packed in our half of pizza that we had left from the night before, in the hotel. It made for a great lunch. :-p. It was nice and cool most the day, and cloudy, always threatening rain, but the rain never came, in fact the sun came out later while we were climbing the second mountain; ugh!! When we crossed VA 42, we ran into 10 and Goalie! They followed us to where Grateful 2 had the truck parked and we gave them a ride to the small grocery store up the road, then we picked them back up after we met up with Grateful 2. 10 was kind enough to buy us a ice cream bar! Yum!!

She also bought Grateful 2 a half gallon of mint ice cream! We looked like hiker trash, packing our packs with all the goodies. Afterwards, we drove back the the trailhead where we were going to start tomorrow and set up camp. Sleep was difficult because the locals kept driving back and forth on the road by where we were camped with ATVs. :-( When we got to the parking lot where the truck was parked we ran into the Konnarock trail crew, who were just wrapping up from doing some trail maintenance; great group of folks!!

Today we got up as soon as the birds started chirping, 0530, and packed up our stuff. I used some of Grateful 2's milk and had two packets of Carnation Instant Breakfast. Then we hit the trail. This time we hiked from VA 630 (676.5) to VA 620 Trout Creek (694.5) for a total of 18 miles! Again, excruciating, because we had two mountains again with lots of rocks, and we even had to do some boulder walking. On the way out we got to see the Keffer Oak tree, the largest tree on the AT.

We stopped at Niday Shelter to eat lunch, and then got back on the trail. We crossed paths with Grateful 2 and he told us that if we got back in time maybe He, his wife Carol, his son A.J., and us could make it to the Homeplace Restaurant and have dinner, but the trail was too harsh for us to hike it fast enough.:-(. We did get to meet Grateful 2's family, and we came back to the trailhead, fixed dinner, and discussed tomorrow's plan...only 14 miles. Whew!! 
Carol and Grateful 2
We hiked up to the Audie Murphy Monument, at the top of Brush Mountain. Audie Murphy was one of the greatest war heroes of all time, and my idol when I was a kid.

Today we got started early and figured that 14 miles would be easy; wrong! Hiking up to Dragons Tooth took 2-3 hours, because of the rocks. And then, coming down was about the same. The trail was slabs of rock with thin ledges we had to walk across and down, at one point it had rungs to climb down.

But, we got to Dragons Tooth, and the 700 mile mark!!

We hiked from VA 620 Trout Creek (694.5) to Scout Trail west of Dragons Tooth parking lot (702.0) for a total of 7.5 miles. 
Coming down, we met up with Grateful 2 and told him that we couldn't do this anymore, and asked him to drop us off at the closest hostel so we could rest and regroup. He said that Four Pines Hostel was full, so I called to confirm. The guy on the phone was rude, and I told him never mind. At this same time, Carol was hiking down with her two dogs and said that she had a place nearby where we could stay, with its own bathroom, for free! We thanked her profusely and said yes. She said there was room for Grateful 2 and his family too! She offered to take us there now, so we cut today's hike short and walked down to the parking lot with her. She pointed out a couple of upcoming trailheads and then took us to her home, where we met her husband Dean. She showed us the room and then we spent the rest of the day talking with her and Dean; what great people!

We waited for Grateful 2, got our stuff out of his truck, and then we all drove to Golden Corral for dinner; it was fantastic!! Later, we all took showers and sat on Carol and Dean's front porch and talked some more; a very enjoyable evening!","VA 620 Trout Creek (694.5)

Today, Carol was kind enough to get up at 6:00 AM to take us back to the trailhead; she even brought Biba (the mama dig) to walk us up to the AT trail! Thank you again Carol and Dean!! 
We hiked from Scout Trail west of Dragons Tooth parking lot (702.0) to Lamberts Meadow Camp Site (719) for a total of 17 miles; that included McAfee's Knob and Tinker Cliffs!
We took a break at the VA 311 crossing and ate lunch; there was a gentleman there playing his guitar. It was a very enjoyable lunch! Then it was time to hike up to McAfee's Knob; what a long hike! We get up there to a ledge, and I thought that we were there! But Bushy realized that it didn't look right, so we asked a couple of passing hikers and they pointed a little further to the right. When we got to the right spot there were quite a few others there and people were kind enough to take our picture while out there on the Knob; so cool!!

So many nice people up there having lunch, offering to take photos of the new comers for them. Two Chinese men came up and we showed where they should sit, they went over and STOOD on that tiny ledge with no fear!!! Sparks took their pictures for them.
When we planned the day our thought was to just hike to the nearest shelter but it was such a perfect temperature and just beautiful skies we hiked on to McAfee's Knob, then after a restful lunch in our chairs we hiked on to Tinker Cliffs. After so many steep ups and downs we thought we may have pushed too far. :-( Then, weather did a freakish turn and the leaves on the trees were blowing so their under sides were showing, we donned our rain gear, to have it just sprinkle and just as fast we were back to blue skies. Finally reaching Tinker Cliffs we enjoyed the views, only seeing three guys on one. One of them showed Sparks where McAfee's Knob was.

We hiked down to the Lambert Meadows shelter but the weeds were waist high making it quite buggy, so after talking with Chip and Cruise, we moved on down to the campsite a little further down the trail. The campsite also has a bearbox due to previous bear activity and a small stream runs right next to it so it was a perfect place to camp. Other tents belonged to a small Boy Scout group run by Yule, a nice gentleman. Later, Blue Stem and Old White Beard (not the 80 year old) joined us. We also saw Lucky and Javier, they kept going on down the trail.
After a nice dinner we did our evening chores and packed it in for the night. Had a great night's sleep listening to the rain tapping on the tent.","Scout Trail west of Dragons Tooth parking lot (702.0)

After a great nights sleep we woke, as we always do, to one LOUD chirping bird; what a great alarm clock! 
We pack up in about fifteen minutes, it is now a mindless routine. We both deflate and pack our pillows, next Sparks stuffs his sleeping bag in its cinch sack, I fold my sheets and put them into their Peregrine waterproof sack. We both deflate and roll up our Thermorest pads and all is stuffed into our backpack while inside the tent, so we are well versed for rainy days. Lastly, I take down the tent and pack in my backpack while Sparks puts Propel into our water bottles. Propel contains potassium, vitamins, and sodium, items that after heavy sweating need to be replaced and you definitely know it when you are depleted you feel tired in your muscles.
We headed down the trail on this clear beautiful morning doing GTT (Going to town) speed. Thinking nine miles would be easy we had quite a bounce in our step....okay then we woke up! There were the usual ups and downs plus another ridge walk that requires rock scrambling. We hiked with Blue Stem for a bit; we find it most interesting to hear about where folks come from and little bits about their lives. There were beautiful views one of which we found Lucky and Javier camping, what a couple of nice guys.

While hiking, we came across some awesome rock formations!

We walked right up to, and close by, the top of one of the huge power lines! You could hear the electricity through it; the buzz/crackling!!

After four and a half hours we finally made it to town. We stood just outside the trail head and tried hitching, with our ""Hiker to Town"" banner, but no takers. Other hikers (Swiss Miss, Hot Sauce, Cruise, and some others) came stumbling out of the forest blinking and such smiles, some even whooped so we were not the only ones fooled by the short miles. Many hikers stay at the Howard Johnson (there is also a Super 8) right by the trail head with many eateries nearby, however, we opted for the Holiday Inn Express, which was further away. There is a four lane busy highway that you have to cross to continue on the trail. We called Homer Witcher shuttle driver, listed in AWOL, and they arrived in minutes telling us no charge since we were on their way, but we still gave them money for gas; it is important to give the shuttle drivers support or they go out of business. 
We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express that is not in a very easy place to walk to Walmart or the trail head but there is a Cracker Barrel across the street. :-p
We hoped to go to trail days on June 2 but it doesn't start until 4:30 PM, and that is just a free dinner; we will pass on that since the event is way out of town and all roads are highways that are a bit scary to hike on. They may have a shuttle but we haven't found how to access it. I guess we will just go back to the trail I had hoped to see the vendors, we want a Steripen Ultra that will do away with mixing chemicals and the twenty minute wait time required with chemicals. 
We quickly get into our room, ahhhh so nice, there is a Kurig machine in the room, so we have great coffee! After a refreshing shower, switching into our town clothes (laundry can wait we are hungry), we hurry over to the Cracker Barrel for lunch. I can't believe I can drink four glasses of soda, we don't even drink soda at home. Once we are filled, back for a nap, even with a ""lead foot"" trotting around upstairs, in the room above us! This hotel has a new washer and dryer so laundry is a breeze only a dollar to wash and a dollar to dry, they sell soap at the front desk.
The only local shuttle driver is going out of town tomorrow evening but was kind enough to take us in the morning to Walmart to resupply before they go.

Today we hopped on the free shuttle (that runs folks back and forth to Trail Days here in Troutville), driven by Jerry (aka Hot & Juicy) and rode it to the trail head at US 220. We hiked from US 220 to Daleville, VA. (728.1) to Wilson Creek Shelter (739.3) for a total of 11.2 miles. We were hoping to go further but we got off to a late start; 08:30, and by the time we got to Wilson Creek Shelter it was almost 4:00 PM, so we opted to stop here and chill.   While hiking today we ran into Crudedog, Disciple, Hot Sauce, Ziplock, Black Bear and Shortcake. We all stopped at Curry Creek to get water and break for lunch. What great weather we had today with blue skies and beautiful sunshine! The trail was awesome with few small rocks but mostly a tiny gravel. We were amazed how quickly the miles sped by. There was water in a couple of locations but we didn't need to stop until noon at Curry Creek. 
It was a great day and we were hiking at a pretty good pace, even with PUDs (Pointless Ups & Downs).  Now we have our tent all set up and are getting ready to eat! Oh, and we had good signal here so we laid in our tent and watched the Season 2 finale of Sense8. :-)","US 220 (Troutville, VA)

Today we got up bright and early and packed up our stuff; while packing the tent we saw a deer, so beautiful. We hit the trail at 06:30, with the intent of hiking a 13 miler. The weather was nice and cool, but humid. We hiked to Bobblets Gap Shelter, supposedly only 7.5 miles away, but with about three PUDs (Pointless Ups & Downs), it felt like forever.  :-|. While hiking we kept crossing back and forth over the Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP), and at one point, we saw a doe and her fawn. They shot off down the bank and crossed the BRP; we were so afraid that they were going to get hit because there was a guard rail on the other side. Momma jumped over it and bambi found a place to go around it; whew!!  
The trail started out very steep and covered in small gravel, when the trail would level out for a stretch it was slanted away from the mountain so caution was required to keep from slipping. No boulders to climb the trail actually passed them by yippee! Eventually the trail was of a very nice tread where rocks in places had been removed you could see them off the side of the trail thank you trail maintainers!
Finally, we made it to Bobblets Gap Shelter, which had water, and we had to decide if it was worth the .3 miles to go down and get it or risk going further where the water source was skeptical.  We decided to get out our chairs and break for lunch and talk about it. I finally left my pack there and hoofed it down for the water.  When I got back Bushy and I talked about whether or not to continue hiking the trail.  We decided that now that we have enjoyed the trifecta (Dragons Tooth, McAfee's Knob, and Tinker Cliffs) there really wasn't any more icons of the trail to look forward to, that now, all we are doing is hiking for the miles; that maybe the fun is over and now it is time to start a new adventure...motorhome.  We both agreed and texted our son; he said that he would come and get us and take us back to his place in NY to visit. So, we planned on getting to Middle Creek Campground and stay until he could come get us. We got off the trail at VA 43 Bearwallow Gap and because there was little or no signal there, we got out our ""Hiker to Town"" banner and started hitching. A very nice gentleman in a jeep stopped and asked where we were heading and we told him Middle Creek Campground, he said he would take us there; how cool was that!!  
The photo is of Sparks relieved about getting off the trail.
While here we ran into Bambi, Ziplock, and Hot Sauce. 
We get checked in at the campground and go to our cabin and find that it is nothing but a private bunk house, no water or bathroom; the bathroom/showers were way back by the main building.  So, I called Homer Witcher (Shuttle Service) and he said he could come right now and bring us back to Troutville! We jumped on it. I cancelled the cabin, and since all we did was set our packs in the cabin, they didn't charge us for the day; whew! 
Homer came and got us and dropped us at the Super 8.  We are now officially off the trail and are waiting for our son to pick us up.
We are sorry to let everyone down that was following us on our journey, but we are okay with stopping at 749.7 miles, and are now considered LASHes (Long Ass Section Hikers) and are ready to get our motorhome and start traveling around the US, with sections of the trail still in our future. :-)","Wilson Creek Shelter
