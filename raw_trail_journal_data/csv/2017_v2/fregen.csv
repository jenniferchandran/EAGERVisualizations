fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521177,"HelloBack in the 1970s when Exxon was Esso and gas stations still gave out free maps the Esso map of New Jersey had the Appalachian Trail marked on it. That piqued my interest and I sent away for the NY/NJ section guide. Many many moves and a completed military career later I still have that 1972 edition of the guide. (My wife of 34 years accuses me – correctly –of being a pack rat.) My plan back then was to take a train into lower NY State and hike the trail to the Delaware Water Gap. Sadly school/work/lack of money/lack of time/life got in the way but the desire to hike the AT never went away.A lot of years have passed since then and I am now close to retirement. The dream has since expanded to encompass the whole trail not just the NY/NJ portion. A year ago I set a target start date of March 2017 and started preparing. While not starting quite from scratch (I have done camping and hiking with my son in Boy Scouts) it was pretty close.My first question was am I physically able to do this? After reading a lot of Trail Journals of those who completed the AT and those who did not I firmly believe those who prepare for it are much more likely to succeed. Sadly, my life as a financial planner is pretty sedentary and I have NOT kept up with my exercising as I should have. So, next post will be the training I started last March and what I plan to do before next March.No trail name yet so I am going to use an amalgam of my first and last name - fregen - as a pre-hike name until I am on the trail.Thanks for stopping by.

fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523571,"The Training(I think I have read that 3 Journal Entries are required before they post. We'll see.)My thought was the best way to prepare to backpack was to actually backpack.Living just east of Kaiserslautern, Germany I have access to a large forest preserve just a few minutes from my home - the Pfälzerwald or Palatinate Forest. In March 2015 I hauled out my old Gregory Windriver backpack (what a beast -7 lbs!)filled it with old gear and started walking. About fifteen minutes of walking gets me into the forest proper with a mix of gravel, dirt and pavement. I started slow but was pretty consistent building up my time and distance and pack weight. I would get out early every morning and get 2 to 3 hours in before work and longer on the weekends, some days exceeding 10 miles. It was a learning process. Of course, I had to work my way through calf cramps, blisters and other assorted foot problems. If anyone would like a little advice: Do not use cheap footgear while you are carrying 25 lbs. I think it is the reason I now have permanent low grade plantar fasciitis in my right foot. Good hiking boots and insoles have it under control for now. BTW if you do 2-3 hours of hiking you can lose weight while still eating normally. I lost 25 pounds from March to November. Sadly when foot problems and darkness (not much daylight here in the winter) sidelined me 15 came back. But I restarted hiking in February and am back to pretty much every day. I expect to drop another 25 before I start my thru hike in March 2017. Then I will be merely overweight. More on my gear next post. Thanks for stopping by.

fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528010,"GearA work in progress. Everyone on the trail probably has a different setup. I was starting mostly from scratch. What I did have was old, too bulky and too heavy. Not bad for a weekend out with the Scouts but way too heavy for a long haul. So a complete outfitting was necessary.
I did a lot of research (still am). Trail Journals and You Tube really provided a wealth of great information. I started reading to find out who completed a through hike, who didn’t, and why. What gear did they recommend? What was good? What was bad? What was unnecessary? What did they do right? Wrong? 
Being a ‘mature’ hiker I looked for others who are similar to me: Lucky 2015, Trail Pilgrim 2015, Sisu 2014, and wanderdog 2016 to name a few. Great insights. Thanks for sharing. 
I noticed that gear carried depends a lot on the type of hike planned. A fundamental question seems to be what are you – a camper or hiker? Or to put it another way what is more important, the journey or the destination?
Hey, I’m a Boomer - I want it all. But it did make me think. When push comes to shove my goal is to get to Maine. But along the way I want to enjoy the camaraderie of fellow hikers, trail angels and trail towns. If the journey isn’t fun why bother?My goal is to complete in about 5 months and to avoid as much of the winter/snowy weather at the beginning and also be through the Mid-Atlantic States before the dog days of summer.   So starting in late March I will need to average 15 miles a day. Approximately 100 days should see me in Vermont. (Men plan, gods laugh.) Terrain, weather, injuries or illness could all make a hash of it. Keeping weight as low as possible is also a factor. I am not an ultra-light hiker. I do want a certain amount of comfort (back to the fun issue). I have been training with 25-30 pounds daily and my body seems to be able to handle that weight so my goal is to hike with 30 pounds or less.But some key points:
Lightweight, sturdy, or inexpensive: Pick 2. Okay, lightweight and sturdy. I will trade money for less weightI want to start in late March 2017. I expect probable cold weather for another 6 weeks.    So initially my load will be heavier than when the weather gets warmer. Crampons, down jacket, 20 deg sleeping bag, gloves.
To average 15 miles a day I intend to have done enough training before getting on the AT that I will not need a long conditioning period. Hopefully I will be hitting my goal after the second week. That also means I should reach resupply points quicker and be able to carry less food.I am going to tent a lot. I will be departing at a very busy time and shelter space will be questionable. Also I am a Universal Blood Donor to the insect world. Hopefully it will help cut down on Norovirus exposure too. I also can afford and do plan to make liberal use of hostels and hotels.So with these factors in mind I started buying gear a year ago. To be continued.   Thanks for stopping by. ""Go for it now.

fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528900,"Time to test that gear I have been buying for the last year.
(BTW Hoozuermama was right. It does take 3 Journal entries before they post.)
My wife has decided to visit our daughter who is stationed in Sicily with the Navy. That leaves me without adult supervision for a week. What better time to actually use this gear rather than just backpacking with it?I immediately made reservations at two approved camping sites in the Pfälzwald: The first is north of Imsbach and the second is east of Ramsen. For those of you unfamiliar with the German milieu they are somewhat sticklers for rules. ""Wild"" camping as they phrase it is pretty much frowned upon. You have to sign up on line and get a permit. €10/$14 a night. Then they send you the coordinates of the campsite. Hope I can get my new Garmin eTrex 30 to work.The route will keep me in mostly forested areas for Friday/Saturday/Sunday. About 20 km/12 miles for the first 2 days and a short 6 miles back in. I want to make it as realistic as possible and as you can see from the profile I was able to get some vertical climbs in.Weather is decent right now with temps around sunrise about 40F and warming up quickly. And it looks like rain on Saturday so that should really be authentic.Wish me luck.Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.

fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529755,"I get it now. If it was easy everyone would get to Maine.
This past weekend was educational. I have to admit to being a bit overconfident. After all I have been training for this for over a year and the past two months have been religious about doing 6-8 miles a day with a 25+ pound pack without stressing. This weekend was an eye opener.
With 3 days food, fuel and water I was hefting 33 pounds. It was a huge difference. It slowed me down, my 22-23 minute miles went to 30. My strides shortened. My GPS told me I did 30 miles but I had enough steps for what would have normally been 36.
But I am in a conundrum. I would consider most of my gear this weekend as essential for comfort and safety. It rained all day Saturday. The rain jacket was definitely required. Temperatures were close to freezing at night (it snowed on Sunday)and the 20 degree down sleeping bag was needed. And I also used a base layer and down jacket to stay warm both for sleeping and hiking. 
Most of my gear is lightweight but to have to room to carry it all I used my Gregory Wind River backpack rather than my REI Flash 62. That added 4 pounds there. This will require more careful packing. My mild disdain for those who weigh their gear using a gram scale is now gone.
But this was valuable. In addition to relooking at my gear I will also need to scale back my mileage expectations at least while I am carrying cold weather gear.

fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549113,"Well, this has been annoying. Gleason score numbers took a turn for the worse a few months ago which mandated prostate surgery 6 weeks ago. I had been putting off until after I finished my AT hike because of the side effects but needs must.Surgery went well (Thank you Army Hospital in Landstuhl, Germany) and I have just gotten first post-op PSA results. 0 which is exactly what it is supposed to be. I am walking again and have just been given okay to start carrying a load. I will rebuild back to 30 pounds over the next couple of months.So everything is looking good to start next March as planned...except for those side effects. Not fun. My doctor tells me I am expecting too much too soon. Yes. But I am working on it. Marginal improvement but not enough. Still I have 6 months and I am motivated. Wish me luck.""Go for it now.

fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553236,"Decided to get back on as I am about 2 1/2 months out from heading to Georgia. While the weather has been frosty here I have still been able to keep up the training generally getting out at least a few times a week. I have been experimenting with different layerings and the cold is not severe negative. New Years Eve I managed to get in 13.5 miles over 5.5 hours. The last couple of weeks have been bad with weather and visitors but I am breaking in a new pair of Oboz boots that I think I will be using to start the hike. They have done well in the recent snow we have had here.New update for my start: Work has me in Las Vegas in 3 weeks. Looking at the long range weather forecast for New Jersey indicates a fairly decent stretch (for January) for the week after next. Temps are in 40/50s and do not dip below freezing at night. So I am going to try to do a flip and hike from the Hudson to the Delaware River. Not sure which way yet. N to S looks like an easier start for the first couple of days. This should give me a chance to do a good shakedown on the gear and since family is close by I can do a bail out if the needs arise.I am liking this idea.""Go for it now.

fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554101,"I was back in the US for 3 days of training and, after checking the weather reports, decided to do a trial run on the actual AT in NJ. It was going to be about 45 to 50 degrees all week. A piece of cake. I also decided to go north from Delaware Water Gap rather than south from NY state line. In retrospect it was probably not a the best decision in either case.After driving up from McGuire AFB I got a very late start from DWG. Trail is quite rocky and more difficult than I was used to in Germany which slowed me down. I wound up only hiking 4 miles and was setting up camp in near dark. Fortunately the Big Agnes tent is color coded for easy set up. It was very windy but not much rain. Used the bear box at the campsite.

I knew from the day before I would not be covering the same miles as I usually do but this was the most difficult trail I have yet walked. At Sunfish Pond the trail went from rocky to just plain rocks. Great care had to be taken with each step placement to avoid injury. By the time I reached the Mohican Outdoor Center at 2:30 PM I was whipped. And it started to snow and rain.
I have frequently read comments about 'Rocksylvania' in TJ and the camp manager at the MOC told me this section of NJ is just as bad. I have to agree. She promises me better trail conditions tomorrow. And I have to give a big shout out to the MOC. I stayed in the bunk house and very comfortable.

Finally after a call to my wife who reminded me it might still snow in April and I did have the gear I went for it. But it was after 9 AM when I got going. Trail conditions did actually improve although I did think it was a little unfair for the trail to always go up with no downs. The part where the trail went straight up a rock face was really fun in the snow. Wind and snow all day. Absolutely no one on the trail but me today. (I saw one person the day prior).
I was trying for Brink Shelter but came up short even though I went until dark. Made camp in the snow and the wind was wicked. Turned out to be a nor'easter. Not unheard of but definitely not in the weather report. Not what I was looking for in a trial run.

fregen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554105,"A short day. I had spoken to my wife Debbie from my tent that morning. I explained that based on trail conditions and the difficulty I was pretty ready to wrap up this experiment. My intention that day was to walk to Culver Gap and have her meet me there.Unfortunately I spoke to her when I was on top of the ridge and could get coverage. That was it for T-Mobile. I had no coverage for the rest of the day. Trail conditions were indeed miserable and I fell a number of times. The snow covering the sheer rock was very treacherous. The ice covered branches were frequently over the trail and required me to push through them. By the time I reached Brink Shelter I was sodden and exhausted and decided to not push on to Culver Gap even though it was still early afternoon. But I had no way to tell Debbie.I set up my tent in the shelter (yes, I know that is ordinarily a no no but again I saw no one that day), filtered water, ate and was in my sleeping bag by 6 PM. At 9:30 PM I was awakened by a very nice Park Ranger who at Debbie's request came by to make sure I was okay. After assuring him I was and speaking to Debbie on his Verizon? phone I thanked him for checking on me and went back to sleep.Thanks for stopping by.""Go for it now.

But the trail was now slush instead of snow which did not make it any safer or easier. I was really careful on the descents and had to go very slowly. I do not think I could have done it without my hiking sticks. They were invaluable. Actually made better time than the previous day. Met up with Debbie at Culver Gap, had a nice lunch, and headed to my sister's home for a shower and to dry out my gear.

After renting a car we had a two day dry to Georgia. Tomorrow I resume my hike but starting at Springer this time.Debbie has been super supportive of my hike and has offered to help me get started by dropping me off and picking me up in the gaps. This will allow me to carry less weight at first while trying to get my legs conditioned. A huge benefit. Of course, this is a limited time offer probably not to exceed a couple of weeks but I fully intend to use it to post some better mileage than I would be able to do otherwise.My January hike taught me a few things to expect:   1. My daily distance will not be as much I would do in Germany. 2, The AT is much rockier and more difficult than what I am used to. 3. I still overestimate my capacity and 4. I need to adapt as necessary.

There were a lot of hikers coming and going. We introduced ourselves to Otter who also started today. After the obligatory photos we returned to the parking lot and I headed up the trail. I was not anticipating how warm it would be. The morning started out cool up it rapidly warmed to the high seventies. My jacket went back into the car at the parking lot and my long sleeved shirt went into the pack 30 minutes later. The trail was rocky in spots and I was very happy with my mileage today. Over 13 but the 1 mile up to the Springer summit doesn't count. However, the climb up Sassafras at the end of a long day was very tough. I was bone tired coming down and the trail was pretty rocky.

Again the day was unseasonably warm and sunny. I was hiking in a tee shirt right away. Unlike the day before I stopped and took time for lunch at Gooch Gap. I am carrying a hydration pack and still found it difficult to drink enough water. Fortunately water sources are still very frequent and I stopped, filtered and refilled my pack. I am sure I drank about 3-4 liters but am also sure it was not enough.
I found the trail a lot smoother for the most part but the climb up to Preaching Rock was a challenge. I met Rose from NC there. She is former Air Force and also doing a thru hike. We are both very slow on the ups.
Henry Gap is not marked on the trail but there is a sign at the street end for some reason. It was very close to the trail and Debbie was waiting for me when I finished up around 6 PM. As I had lost a rubber tip off one of my hiking poles we headed to WalMart to see if they had a replacement. No joy. But we did have pizza for dinner!
