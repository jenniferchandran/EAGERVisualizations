Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554052,"I am a recently retired Electrical Engineer who started hiking the Appalachian Trail back in 1974 with my wife for our honeymoon! The plan was to hike the whole thing, but several things conspired to keep that from happening.We had very heavy packs, no experience and little money. We dropped out after entering North Carolina and returned home. After forty three very active years, we both have retired and the trail is calling again. My wife's knees don't like the impact from down hill hiking and she will only be able to hike sections with me.We have covered all 48 of the 4000 foot mountains in New Hampshire and I have covered all but about 20 miles of the AT in New Hampshire. We have covered some of the AT in Vermont and several sections in Maine. We climbed Mount Katahdin via the Knife's Edge and can understand why it is a superb end for the north bound hike.I hope to provide weekly updates to let everyone know how it is going. We have almost all the gear and travel arrangements in place and we're getting the mail drops set up now.I have been saying ""we"", because my wife will be my support team. She will meet me at several places and hike as much as her knees will allow.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Wed",0
Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554151,"Working on food to take with me to start at Springer Mountain and resupply packages. I will be bringing a bear vault even though it weighs 2 lbs, 9 oz! The good thing is it takes care of the 5 miles section in Georgia and simplifies having to find a tree to hang a food bag from. I can also use it for a seat.I am still working on cutting down my gear to lighten up my load.I tried a short 3 mile run a week ago only to end up with heal pain the next day.My doctor gave me a cortisone injection to cut down on the inflammation. The diagnosis is acute plantar fasciitis and we hope it will resolve quickly.I guess that is what I get for not running for the last two years after doing it for roughly 20 years, Monday thru Friday during lunchtime at work.""You pay for your sins!""",,View Entry,"Feb 02, Thu",0
Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554186,Yesterday I picked up a bottle of 10% concentration Permethrin from Tractor Supply. I have set up my outside storage shelter to allow me to soak and hang my gear outside in it. The quart bottle costs $17.99 on sale and to make 0.5% I will add 19 parts of water to one part of the concentrate. I am following the directions based on this web site:http://sectionhiker.com/permethrin-soak-method-guide/I Picked up a five gallon bucket and lid at the same time to mix in and soak my garments in. After soaking I will hang the item on a line over the bucket and let the excess drip into the bucket. I will use rubber gloves and wring the garment out to aid in drying. I am considering if I should treat my base layer. I am still undecided at this point. More on this later....,,View Entry,"Feb 05, Sun",0
Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554396,"I was told there is a possible problem with the Velcro that holds the waist belt on some Osprey backpacks at a training session by a local sporting goods vendor.It seems the Velcro can let go if it gets wet! Knowing it might rain on the AT (!) I wonder if other people have had a problem with their Osprey packs?I contacted Osprey customer service they mentioned some models had a problem and it depends on when they were made. I sent them the PO# on the tag in the pack and I am waiting for a reply.Has anyone had a problem with this?We have been putting meals together and doing some work on the exact gear selection over the last few days. I am getting anxious to get started! Thanks,Fred","

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554583,"Customer service at Osprey is sending me a new type of buckle to fix the potential issue of the Velcro coming apart if it gets wet.

The new buckle allows the strain to be placed on the end fixed to the pack and removes the strain from the Fit on the Fly Velcro end.
 
If anyone is having trouble with Osprey packs Velcro coming unfastened after it gets wet from sweat or rain you should give customer service a call.
 
After reading about possibly losing a bear vault if a bear knocks it about I wrapped two rows of yellow and black reflective tape on mine. The yellow part of the tape reflects light back towards the source much the same as road warning signs do. This should help find it if it gets moved around. I am also thinking of securing a small cable around it so it can be secured to a tree.

Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Back to putting my meals together...still looking for ideas on the WEB.","

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555100,"I mixed up two gallons of 0.5 percent permethrin in a five gallon plastic bucket from Tractor Supply. I soaked my zip off hiking pants, my rain pants and jacket, and some other outerwear. I wrung out a lot of the excess and hung the clothes on a line in my canvas car shelter. It has above 60 the last two days and I will let them dry and air out a few more days. I made sure no cats can get in since permethrin is toxic to them. There is more than one and a half gallons left and I plan on spraying my tent fly and ground cloth. I may spray the outside of the screens also.

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556982,"We flew into Atlanta Friday and drove up to Dawsonville Georgia for two nights. The rental car was making a noise and we ended up returning to the airport and exchanging it. We are now at the Amicalola lodge for the next two nights. Barbara and I drove to the intersection of forest road 42 and the AT which is a mile north of Springer. We hiked to the start of the trail and took some photos of us next to the plaque and the 1st white blaze!
Our relatives from Jacksonville, FL arrived and we plan on relaxing tomorrow with them and then we all will hike to Springer by the forest service road early Tuesday. We will do another photo shoot and my hike will start. 
We drove to the Top of Georgia hostel in Hiawassee and left a resupply package there. The service was great and the place looks real nice. 
Time to get some sleep. It was a busy day!","

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557564,"Fred, oops, ""Toast"", has asked me to update his journal. Hello everyone, I'm Mrs. Toast.Toast is having a great time. He started the trail at Springer Mountain on Tues, March 21st and last night he tented near Low Gap Shelter, mile 42.9.The first night on the trail he was tenting near Hawk Mountain campsite during a thunderstorm...lightning, hail, and high winds included. The weather has been comfortable since then. The forecast for tonight is possibly a thunderstorm with 1-2 inches of rain. (www.atweather.org)Toast said one reason he is enjoying this so much is because it reminds him of when he used to run at lunchtime with his co-workers. He's getting ""into the zone"" and challenging himself. He's also meeting some incredible people. His fellow hikers are fascinating. He is thoroughly enjoying hiking with them and sharing stories.While I was typing this, he just called me. The cell signal from the trail has been good so far. He has decided to do a relatively short day today to give his feet some rest. He thinks he'll be losing a toenail soon. He'll be tenting near Blue Mountain shelter near mile 50. He sounds great.Happy trails to all!(The trip miles should say 50, not 10, but the system generated that and so I don't know how to correct it. Sorry about that!) ((The FAQ section of this site explains how to correct the trip miles.))","Springer Mountain

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557991,"This is Day 8 for Fred on the AT. He hiked 16 miles today. The photo shows him at the NC/GA border. He's tenting tonight at mile 86 near the Standing Indian Shelter.Yesterday he got a shuttle into Hiawassee to take a shower and do laundry and eat a hamburger. He also waterproofed his tent again because he has been in some heavy rain storms. Plus he got his supply box that we had dropped off for him at the Top of Georgia Hostel.The chest pack he is wearing is a fly fishing pack that he is finding very helpful. He keeps his lunch and snacks in it as well as a map, flashlight, compass, and whatever else he needs during the day. This allows him to hike while he eats during the day and he doesn't have to stop to take off his pack very often.Before he started the trail, he decided he would use Smart water bottles instead of a water bladder. But he didn't like the idea of reaching back to grab the bottle each time he wanted a drink. Here's what he did.....he bought some 5/16"" clear hose from the hardware store and put one end of it in boiling water. Then he put that end through the hole in the pop-up cap of the water bottle. It fits really snugly and doesn't leak. He then connected the mouthpiece from his water bladder to the other end of the hose and has that end on his chest. The total length of the hose is about 2 1/2 feet. The rangers who saw this at Amicalola were quite impressed. Once an engineer....always an engineer!While he was packing for the trail he was trying to decide how many pages of the AT Guide he wanted to take with him for the beginning of the trail. He checked online and found out he could download pdf versions of both ""The AT Guide"" and the ""Thru-Hikers' Companion"". There was a small fee for both. He's very pleased to have those with him and said he can read them real well on his phone. Happy trails to all!","Dick's Creek Gap

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558215,"I have been having a great time out here in Georgia and North Carolina hiking and getting in shape. I was the 1045th hiker to register at the Amicalola visitor center. When I registered a young woman did a pack shakedown for me. She suggested I send home my gaiters, an outer shell for a jacket and the outer case for the CPR kit I got at work. My pack weight is about 36 lbs and changes as I eat or drink water. The weather has been overcast most of the days, but not raining. The trail is in very good shape mostly with some sections wet and rocky. The rocky downhills are very hard on my plantar fasciitis in my heel. I hiked with Rabbit Hole today and got a ride into Franklin, NC. Mrs Toast had set up a room so I could pick up the package she sent and take a break. We went to Outdoor 76, a well-known outdoor supply place and I had a shoe specialist check out my boots. He told me my boots were entirely the wrong size. My normal shoe is a 9.5, but the last time I bought my boots they sold me 11.5s . I have been having to over tighten the laces to keep my feet from sliding around. I am back to a 10.5 like my older boots were. I will see how my heel does now. After walking about an hour it feels much better. I climbed a fire tower on top of Albert Mountain only to do it. The view was covered in clouds. There was a large photo on a plaque showing what we should have seen. It cleared up later and it was great hiking weather. I have to pack up now. ..more later.","Standing Indian Shelter

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558294,This is Day 11 and Toast is tenting at the Wayah Bald Shelter (mile 120.5).He and Rabbit Hole hiked together today and saw some good views from the tower at Wayah Bald.They've also seen long sections of the devastation from the last year's wildfires in the area.The new boots have been OK but he does have a couple of hot spots. They expect it to be cold tonight. How cold? He didn't say. (At least they aren't having the snow storm we're having now in New England!)  In a few days they will be at Fontana Dam which is the southern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  Happy Trails to all!,"Winding Stair Gap near Franklin, NC

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558431,Today is Day 12 on the trail and Toast said he had the best views on the trail so far. He climbed to the top of Wesser Bald observation tower where he had views of distant mountains all around. Stunning!He did leave his hiking poles at the tower but another hiker was kind enough to bring them to him when they all stopped at the shelter for the night. Thank you Trapper!It was rough terrain and several hikers found it hard on their feet on the descent from Wesser Bald Shelter to Rufus Morgan Shelter. Toast is dealing with a couple of blisters.He has a nice level campsite tonight and the water sources have been really good.Tomorrow the plan is to go 1 mile to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) for breakfast and a shower and then hike a short day to Sassafras Gap Shelter.Happy trails!,"Wayah Bald Shelter

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558518,"This is Day 13. The attached photo shows the Class of 2017 board for hikers to sign at the Outdoor 76 store in Franklin, NC. Toast signed it under the AT symbol. He also sent me a photo taken while he was at the top of the observation tower at Wesser Bald yesterday and I added that to yesterday's post. Toast hiked 1 mile to the Nantahala Outdoor Center this morning and had a delicious breakfast. That looks like the place to be for anyone interested in rafting or kayaking. Then he went another 6.7 miles to the Sassafras Gap Shelter where he is tenting tonight.He mentioned how much he is appreciating the little things....like a dry place to sit for a break during the day. It was a grueling hike yesterday at the end of the day coming down into the Rufus Morgan Shelter area and several hikers are having trouble with their feet. Toast said he stops 2 or 3 times a day to air out his feet and change his socks. He is having trouble with blisters and is using moleskin and bandages.  The temperature today was in the 70s. He is planning to be at the Fontana Dam in two days. The shelter there is known as the ""Fontana Hilton"".  Happy trails and comfortable feet to all!","Rufus Morgan Shelter

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558821,"Rabbit Hole and I started from Sassafras Gap Shelter and hiked to the Cable Gap Shelter. It started raining lightly when we were finishing packing. We had light rain up to about 1:00 and then a heavy thunderstorm started. Rabbit had a ten minute head start coming out of Stecoah Gap, since I had to take care of business and digging a hole in rock and root filled ground is tough! It started to pour and continued with some lightning and thunder for the next few hours. Water found any spot available to seep into my pack and most everything was wet or damp. The rain jacket kept me warm enough even with my clothes getting wet from sweat.I caught up to Rabbit Hole at Brown Fork Gap Shelter. The shelter was crammed with hikers getting out of the rain and staying. I told Rabbit Hole I was moving on to Cable Gap Shelter, another 6.1 miles ahead. The rain stopped after about an hour and we had been covering ground well. A few hikers we passed had fallen on the wet, muddy and rocky trail. One snapped his expensive carbon fiber pole and was less than pleased! I got a line strung between trees and dried out most of my gear. My boots are still wet and my feet looked like prunes with several new blisters when I took the boots off.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558829,News from Toast.....he hiked hard yesterday and he tells me his feet suffered. He and Rabbit Hole had a short hike today to Fontana Lodge where they are staying tonight. He was able to dry out his boots and feet and his feet feel better today.The sun came out today and the Fontana Resort is beautiful. There are flowers blooming along the trail. The forecast for some of the higher peaks is several inches of snow and high winds in the next few days. He found out the fly fishing chest pack he has been using is not meant for continuous use. It has ripped and he decided to leave it in the hiker's box. Another hiker took it and decided to give it a try.He got the required hiking permit today which gives thru hikers 7 nights and 8 days to hike the 70 mile trail through the Great Smoky Mountains NP.,"Cable Gap Shelter

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558930,"Wed, April 5th--Day 16Update from Toast:We did a zero today waiting for Rabbit Hole's resupply package. One of my packages was waiting for me and other was at the Fontana Village Post Office. I had shipped several meals and some extra gear from an outfitter in Franklin and Mrs Toast had shipped enough meals when combined with mine will make up enough to hike through the Smokies.The hike in the rain a few days ago has done a number on my feet. I bought some Epsom salts at the Fontana General store and soaked each foot for 20 minutes in warm water and the salts. The blisters on my right little toe have broken and covered the side between the toes and all the bottom. I cleaned the area after removing the flap of skin. I then resoaked that foot another 10 minutes after climbing off the ceiling from the sting from the salts.I bandaged the area after putting some triple antibiotic cream on it.Mrs Toast is flying in tomorrow night and I hope she has some ideas since it is very difficult to walk on my right foot.Taking a few zero days at the Fontana lodge is nice. The resort just opened for the season a week or so ago and is still awakening for the season. Even with the rain we are having it's a nice place. We are holding up here an extra day or maybe two to avoid hiking into some bad weather up in the Smokies. There is a storm dropping 6 to 8 inches of snow in the higher elevations. This is accompanied by high winds and cold temperatures. Not a good idea to get caught up in that! I am really looking forward to seeing Mrs Toast tomorrow! Happy hiking to all and good night! (This is Mrs Toast......And I'm really looking forward to seeing Mr Toast tomorrow  My idea for his foot is to rest it and find a clinic and have a it checked by a doctor. Originally the plan was for me to spend some time at Fontana Village while he was there for some zero days and then I was going to meet him on top of Clingman's Dome. I would drive up, if the road is open, and Fred would hike up. At this point, I think it will be a few days before Fred is hiking again. Stay tuned.)","Fontana Lodge

Toast ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559364,"After soaking my feet in Epsom salts and removing most of the skin from my right toe I bandaged it with triple antibiotic ointment. I found walking on my right foot was difficult and even after several days it is still uncomfortable. I am heading home with Mrs Toast after going to the highest point on the trail this morning. We are waiting for the road to Clingmans Dome to be opened after being closed for several days due to snow and ice. After having hiked over 160 miles and spent two weeks setting up my tent and sleeping in some very sloping spots I have decided I would much rather hike and camp with Mrs Toast in select areas rather than trudge through miles and miles of the same terrain and seeing the same thing over and over. It has been a learning experience for me and I have enjoyed the challenges and the people I have met. Hiking with Rabbit Hole was very enjoyable and we covered many miles quickly. I want to thank so many of the hikers, Trail Angels and all the people I met in towns and other places that made my hike a special experience. I hope I helped make everyone's hike a little better.The best of luck to everyone and thank you very much,Toast","Fontana Lodge
