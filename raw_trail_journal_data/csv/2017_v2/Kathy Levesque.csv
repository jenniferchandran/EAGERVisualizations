Kathy Levesque,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557600,"Bev & I was dropped off by Dan & Marcel at Amicalola Falls this morning at 7:30 am. Then caught a ride up to Springer Mountain with Alpine Hiker, a former AT Hiker. He was full of knowledge about the trail and gave us tips on how to succeed, things to watch out for and most importantly wished us luck and ....we got kisses from his dog. Sorry Alpine, we forgot his name, but what a beautiful dog. I miss my girl, Cabella already. Today's hike was fairly easy, met about 8-10 people on the trail throughout the day, no wildlife except birds singing away, it was very peaceful. 
Sitting up my tent the frame broke on my Big Agnes UL1 so thankfully I had the repair splint with me that came with the tent so I could still set it up. Once I had cell service I called my trail coach, and friend Sharon, aka Trail name Cozy to call REI where it was purchased to see what I should do. Cozy called Neel Gap, at mile 31.4 at Mountain Crossing, a full service outfitter. They had the same tent so they are holding one for me.Thank you!
Our first night was a real learning experience, one, our tent site was about .4 miles away from the water source.... downhill & to the privy..(outhouse).. and the bear box. After walking all day with packs that weigh 34 & 36 lbs, that extra walking stinks! My pack weight is 34, Bev's 36 with 1liter plus 16 oz of water. We had no tree limbs to hang our food bags so glad for the bear boxes at this campsite. Two, we both up set some of our cooked food right by our tent....that's a no no with ?? bears everywhere! Then I opened up a packet of peanut butter which spilled out all over my dirty hands and onto the ground!!! With no paper towels I decided the only thing I could do is lick my hand clean, the best I could and then washed some with my drinking water and dry off on my one and only towel. Then I had to dig hole and bury the peanut butter that was on the ground. We had a great nights ??","Springer Mountain

Kathy Levesque,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557655,"We were up at 7:00 am and on the trail about 8:15..we will get better at packing up as time goes on. It was warm today, 65-70 but no complaints from me, I just strip down to my tee & zipped off my converter pants to shorts. We haven't met many hikers and the 10 or so that camped with us last night haven't caught up to us....We are doing great! As Bev & I keep saying, ""we've got this""! OK Cozy, we must say, you were right about Sassafras Mtn., yes it was soooooo awesome! I may go back one day and try it again...NOT! Ha! Ha!  We stopped for the night early because everyone is saying a bad thunderstorm was coming in by 8 pm. We could already here thunder off in the distance. We sat up our tents and had a quick bite to eat, then hung our food bags and anything with a scent up in a tree. If you go to my photos you may see a picture of our first bear hang. We are pros at it I must say, practice before going out on the trail did help. Bev even gave a guy, Everest a lesson on the PCT bear hang, check it out on YouTube! The night was wild...thunder, lightning, rain, hail and high winds for over 3 hours! My wind lifted my tent sideways at one point! I'll be putting all 4 tent stakes in from now on. Bev & I got to poop in the woods for the first time while on the AT, lol... For those that don't know, the Appalachian Trail has a, "" Leave No Trace"" policy...which means , dig a hole do your duties & bury it!! No littering either, carry in carry out!!! I've even picked up some on the trail which probably fell out of someone's pockets or pack.   I didn't sleep last night very well, but the light show was great! Life on the trail is wonderful! Good night. Look at my photos , hopefully they are posting... I'm having a tough time journaling on my iPhone.","Hawk Mountian campsite

Kathy Levesque,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557667,"We had another great day, again we were up early and on the trail in record time for us, 45 mins. without breakfast. We've been stopping after a couple hours on the trail and eating cereal or a power bar or trail mix. No wildlife seen except birds again. Seeing a Red Cardinal first thing was emotional, I know its one of my Angel's. Thank you for watching over me. I ended up with a blister on my left foot near my arch area which is a weird place to get one but that's ok because it doesn't hurt too bad. I can't wait to get to Neel Gap, to exchange my tent and take a shower and Dr up my blister. Bev has one in the same place so we are blaming it on our inserts...SuperFeet, we both put new ones in before we left. I almost forgot...We had ""Trail Magic"" today from Twelve Tribes, Jeremiah, Nathan, Skillet & others. Lentil soup, homemade bread, apples and drinks! Thank you very much!!!","Justus Creek

I'm really tired this morning but we got up early and started walking. Blood Mountain was a killer today, glad for the cooler temps! What gorgeous sites at the top, no picture captures the beauty of this place.... All I keep saying is look how beautiful Bev! We are so blessed to be here. Thank you Dan for supporting me on this journey, I really wish you & Cabella were with me. 
We arrived into Neel Gap to get my new tent and mailed the broken one back to REI to get my refund. That's why I purchased most of my gear from them, they are great about replacing stuff that may break, tear or whatever. Thanks REI. We got to see Alpine Hiker working at Mountain Crossings were I got the tent they held for me. 
We stayed at Blood Mountain Cabins and enjoyed the night there eating pizza, sub sandwiches & sitting on soft chairs & sofa....plus slept in comfortable beds. Oh, yes...the hot shower was amazing!!! The owners even did our laundry, thank you! 
I slept like a baby too.","Lance Creek

We were once again too far from our water source & privy but we had a great meal cooked outside with no spills, just watery mashed potatoes because I added too much water. The chicken was very tasty though, thanks Mountain House! 
We left early knowing we had a long day. It was a beautiful easy day, nothing important to report.

We talked about margarita's for two days so we had a 20 oz one!! The food was delicious too. We did laundry & I tried most of the day to catch up with my trail journals....which has been a pain!! If I could journal every night it would help. I'm all messed up on days. If something on my entries doesn't look right it's because I'm learning and behind doing it.

Now I'm in my tent exhausted, ready for bed but it's only 7:30.    Oh, I forgot, Bev's lens fell out of her glasses today which could of been bad, she's almost blind without them. The screw was still in the frame do I used my handy mini Swiss Army knife and fixed them for her.    No wildlife seen today either. Bev and I only saw about 5 people all day today, it was great! Here at this campsite there are 20 tents though, 3 dogs so the bear won't come near here.     It's supposed to cool off tonight and it's calling for thunder showers towards early morning.

My tent underneath was a muddy mess again! My tyvek was even worse so it took time to pack up this morning. Our hike today wasn't bad, mostly downhill to Dicks Creek. Highway 76 runs by here.     When we arrived at the parking lot there was ""trail magic""! Former AT hiker, Parachute had McDonald's hamburgers for the hikers.... Bev & I inhaled two each!

Thanks to a morning power bar & some powdered propel mixed in my water helped get me going. We hiked most of the day in the clouds, which was kind of eerie but beautiful at the same time. It was so quiet & peaceful. We had a great afternoon except the scenery of burnt forest wasn't pretty. At about 2:00 we stopped to have a power bar for lunch while filtering water and sat a chatted with, King & Wide Sky. I made a comment to them, I think we are almost to a parking area, wouldn't it be great if there was some trail magic. Well, it was there at Deep Gap!!! Granny & Old Goat had so much food for us hikers! Beans, rice, cooked broccoli & carrots, pastas, drinks, Oreo cookies & so much more!!! Thanks again for your generosity! Their daughter hiked the AT a few years ago. This is were we heard that a bad thunderstorm was coming in about 8 pm so we decided to say in our first shelter for the first time! This is a three sided hut. Look through my pictures you'll see what one looks like. There ended up being 6 of us in the shelter, one being a Ridge Runner, her name was Shelo (? Spelling).... she patrols 60 miles of trail, as a volunteer! I think that's so amazing. Thanks for your kindness & stories. It was a wild, stormy, cold, damp night.... I got zero sleep! The thunderstorm started about 8 pm & didn't end until 7 or 8 am! Bev & I was so thankful we stayed in the shelter, others who stayed in tents had a muddy mess to clean up. Thank you Lord for keeping us all safe.","Bly Gap.

It's another overcast morning but the AT weather forecast calls for partly sunny skies, temperatures 58...Perfect for hiking! We are still at 4,742 feet and will be at this elevation or higher all day. We climb Albert Mountain today. I almost stepped on a bright red salamander on the trail....I posted it in my photos. Later on down the trail I found someone's bread, yup there it was laying in the mud. I picked it up and wiped it on my dirty towel and had Bev attach it to my backpack! Lol. I believe it was dropped by a guy who stayed in the shelter last night, trail name, Milk Jug. I decided to carry it in case we caught up to him. Then down the trail about .05 I find two huge beautiful, delicious looking fresh tomatoes!!! Bev & I laughed so hard??. Again, assumed it must be Milk Jugs. We wipes them dry and stuffed them in on top of the bread bag. Ok, now my pack weighs probably 1lb more but ....being the Good Samaritan I am, I carried it, lol We are still in an area that burned last Fall, makes me ill looking at it. We walked 8 miles to the next shelter thinking we'd see Milk Jug but no one had seen him,...by now I was tired of carrying this bag dangling and swinging on the back of my pack.... I started thinking if we don't see him soon I was going to have a tomato & tuna sandwich! I mentioned it to Bev and she thought oh my God, yes let's do that!!! So we did. Sorry MJ but thank you, it was delicious! God forgive us.We arrived at Betty Creek Gap and there were two women there, after talking only a few minutes asking were everyone was from, they say, ""Oh, you two are the Maine Sisters"", everyone is talking about you! So it looks like our trail names might be, the Maine sisters, that's too funny, one of these ladies was from Winslow, Me., her sister Betty from SC. Sorry I forgot the name of the one from Maine...We'll probably see them again. We sat up our homes, I mean tents for the night and cooked Chili mac & cheese with beans....It was yummy. Off to bed we go because we have another 12.2 miles to go to get into Franklin, NC for a zero day!!!!Cant wait for a shower, it has been six days! Oh do we ever stink!!

We walked 12 or more miles today, tough last 4 miles into Franklin, NC for our zero day....Resupply, eat, stay in a motel....shower, relax and rest our feet and legs! We hitched a ride into town, 10 miles from Winding Stair Gap...yup Bev stuck out her thumb, just like back in high school in the 70's! It wasn't too scary because there happened to be a retired police officer trying to catch a ride too. No one was stopping for him so Bev said, let me try! Right off a very nice lady with a pickup stopped and took all three of us right to our motel. Thanks to another wonderful person, it was so much appreciated. Our feet were killing us....just very tired. 
We went to a brewery after showering and putting on our clean camp clothes..(shorts & tee shirts with our Croc shoes). We had one beer and met a nice couple Laura & Sean who found out we were AT through hikers. They offered to come pick us up at the Sapphire Inn tomorrow, take us to WalMart to get our food & let us do our laundry at their house. That's so amazing!

Our bathroom shower won't turn off completely so the extremely hot water it leaking a lot! Management knows about it and someone is coming to fix it. Sean & Laura came to get us to go do our laundry at their house. Bev, Laura & Sean had yummy looking Bloody Mary's but I opted not to have one because I had too many things to do that day, once I have one of those I need a nap, lol!!! We went to WalMart to pick up supplies & then we went back to our room to repack and organize our gear. Our shower still hasn't been fixed so our bathroom is like a steam room. Bev slipped on the floor and almost fell down! Water is dripping off the ceilings and running down the walls! We once again complained so we'll see if it gets fixed.Bev & I waked 2 1/2 miles to a Verizion store in our crocs/camp shoes so she could get an adapter for her new cell phone charger. We then bribed an employee to give us a ride back to the motel, ha! ha!.... Funny two people walking over 2,000 miles home and we asked for a ride! I can see that after 5 to 6 months on the AT we definitely will have walked a lot more than that. We hit the trail tomorrow!!

We told him this was something we'll be doing a lot. 15 mins into our up hill hike it started pouring and then came the thunder & lightning!!! Bethany St Pierre, I thought of you! I prayed really hard to God, Adam & all my Angel's to keep us safe! We did stop once along the trail and covered up with my tarp until we thought the storm passed. Another thunderstorm started again shortly after staring out again! We had about 4 miles to get to the nearest shelter so we hiked on as fast as we could. That darn shelter was a mile off the main AT trail! The trail was like walking in a stream it was raining so hard! Once at the shelter ....which was over filled with hikers,Bev & I had to get out of our wet clothes, we we're soaked, so right there in front of other drenched hikers doing the same thing, we stripped out of our wet clothes to put on dry ones. I poured water out of my boots! I was so cold and miserable. When the rain stopped for about 15 mins we quickly helped each other put up our tents, the wind was blowing too hard to do it alone. We threw up my para cord that I hang my food bag with around the inside of the shelter and Bev, I and others used it to hang up soggy clothes, socks, etc.!!It was a long scary night, with high winds & pouring rain but we made it through it again. The next morning I took down my clothes line so I could hang everything outside in the sunshine & breeze. We left about 11:00 am, everything was dry except our boots. Like when I was a kid, I put plastic bags over my socks and put my foot inside my wet boots.One other thing, I want to thank Laura back in Franklin for the emergency blanket.

Its tough finding a level spot to pitch our tents.When we first went to bed we heard an owl, he/she was so comforting to here...better than thunder and howling winds! This morning is looking like rain again, NO!!! I forgot to tell everyone, I have one of those fancy, Suunto watches that has a compass, time & date, altimeter/barometer....which has an alarm to alert us of severe weather. Well, guess what, this thing hasn't alerted us once yet!! The face has been steamed up for two days and it's supposed to be waterproof. Maybe it's defective. I'll have to contact REI about this. So frustrating! We didn't get far this morning before we realized it was going to be another miserable day and a few hikers we've seen today say it's going to be another bad one. We stopped at the next shelter, Cold Springs, for the rest of the day & night. It stinks to stop this early 10:30 am and only 5 miles. :-( but after getting our stuff almost dry we didn't want to put our tents up in the rain, and not to mention, my boots are still wet!

Or, maybe it's because we laid around all day yesterday...I'm just glad to be back on the trail again!! Once on the trail I called NOC at 9:00 am when they opened to reserve a room for two nights, we hear it's going to be really cold until Saturday. We did get a room, yay!!! It was a tricky walk into NOC, lots of mud on top of rotten wet slippery leaves and then slippery rocks on Weser Bald.

We've cranked the heat to 75!! The washer and dryer is being used so we've decided to go eat real food! We went to the outfitter store because Bev needed a new pair of boots, hers have been hurting her feet. Bev's debit card wouldn't work again! She called the bank and come to find out the person who stole her credit card information two weeks ago was trying to find out why her old card wasn't working. I guess since it was phone fraud Bev has to go into a bank, show her ID and other forms of identification before they issue her a third card!!

I can't remember all their trail names but they had hiked before; Packman, DOC Holiday & one other. Thank you so much!!We left there and hiked about 1/2 mile in the rain when we spotted a cow barn in a field that looked very inviting!! We went closer to check it out and it was empty but most importantly, dry!!! There was no signs saying, No Trespassing, so we sat up our tents....

I told her I was thinking about going home, She looked at me and said,she thought the same thing yesterday herself...We both agreed to wait a few days first, we will probably change our minds.
Today is going to be an emotionally tough day in more ways than one,... First, the trail is like a river it's rained so much, it's a little foggy and second, my Gram Vera's funeral service and burial back home in Maine is today. She passed in March just before I got on the trail but since it was winter her service is today. My siblings are all home and here I am, on a muddy trail thousands of miles away. Gram's birthday is today too, she would of been 104!!! She was an amazing woman, I'll miss her terribly. I talk to her & Adam daily,
Oh, ya.... these rocks stink, rocks everywhere.... our feet are killing us!
When I finally get a signal I get messages from home, thanks Jason for the nice message for Mothers Day! I called and talked to Dan, Pam & my parents. 
Dave sent me pictures of Adam's gravesite, they had put flowers by his headstone. I cried. Gram is buried near there with my biological dad Albert & grandfather, George. My dad passed when I was barely two years old. We believe he probably had Cystic Fibrosis like Adam had. 
We both just walked all day & fast, and was quite.... we both had an attitude problem, lol We weren't mad at each other but ticked we were here on this Rocky Mountain!!!  We hiked 20.0 miles though so if we keep this up we'll be in Maine in no time! Ha!Ha!

It's really hot out today, 81 by 11:00 am.We stopped to put our hot tired feet in a stream late afternoon. Bev even took her shirt off and wet it in the stream and put it back on. I just soaked my buff and put it around my neck to cool off. Just having our feet in the water helped get us the next several miles.I was a little freaked out once on the trail.....I looked up and all I could see was this big black thing running towards me on the trail! My first thought was, a bear!  I was about to turn around and scream to Bev but then realized what it was, especially after seeing about 8 more of them coming towards me....Cows!!  lol   I scared them as much as they did me.  They all turned around and started heading back the other way but did keep stopping to see if I was still coming towards them.  I was talking to them and encouraging them to keep on going. We finally got to a field were they must of come from and they finally got out of our way. Several hikers have warned us they've seen rattlesnakes on the trail so I've been trying really hard to pay attention and watch for them. The warm weather is bringing all the snakes out, I've seen several black ones. I'm not a fan of snakes either.We arrived at the shelter/campsite about 6:45 pm. We quickly put up our tents, made our beds, cooked our meals, hung our food bags, brushed our teeth and in our sleeping bags by 8:00 pm totally exhausted.

I called my husband, Dan first and told him about Bev going home and of course he said, please come home too. I told him I was going to think about it tonight and make my decision by morning.  I called Cozy and she gave me a lot of great advice, she asked me not to go home to just take a few days off and stay at the hostel before I make any decision because I was doing great and these emotions are all normal. I did remind her....and she knew I've been thinking about wanting to go home a few weeks now and how homesick I've been. I promised her I'd sleep on it.We made it to the hostel at 4:30 pm.
