Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570265,"2 days until our departure... I stubbed my toe walking into the doctor's office today. It was bleeding all over the place and my toenail dug into my skin. On a normal day, this would not be a big deal. But 2 days before a long distance hike, I am a bit concerned. My feet really took a beating on our section hike last year without having a foot injury, so it's going to be tough starting out with this issue already. Believe it or not, one of the main reasons that hikers get off the trail is because of infected foot wounds. Hiking 15 miles a day on a stubbed, bloody toe and sensitive toe nail is not going to be pleasant. In addition, infection is a real issue due to sweating in socks day after day without showering.  I plan to nurse my toe as much as possible in the next two days and while hiking to prevent infection and further injury. I could not imagine having to get off the trail because of a stupid toe! ",,View Entry,"Jun 28, Wed",0
Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570486,"We made it through our first day! The day started off through a rocky, unmarked mess called Devil's Racecourse. Then, we hit our first big climb. I must admit it was really hard. My legs were on fire! By the time we got to the top, I was ready to set up camp and we had only gone 3 miles. It was an easy jaunt to Raven Rock Shelter, where we had lunch with Mya and Daniel who we met along the way. After lunch, we had 5 miles to go. The terrain wasn't too bad, but the bottom of my feet were getting sore. I'm not sure why that was. Thank God, I didn't have any problems with my stubbed toe. Water has been flowing great down here, too. We're able to fill up every 2-3 miles for the most part. During the last few miles of the day, we were caught in a thunderstorm for 45 minutes or so. I thought that was going to be the miserable end to our first day, but it actually wasn't too bad.  I wasn't completely soaked and we made it to Cowall Shelter for the night before it rained again. At this point, all I can do is hang my clothes and boots in the shelter and hope they dry by tomorrow. Overall, my body is beat. My feet are beat. And I need to adjust my pack because it's killing my shoulders. But it was a good day!","Pen Mar Park

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570606,"My night at Cowall Shelter did not quite go as planned. I had a bad case of dehydration and lost a lot of electrolytes over the day. I went to bed with a horrible migraine and woke up with nausea and cold sweats every few minutes. Finally around 12:30, I had to jump off the top bunk and run out of the shelter to throw up. Honestly, I thought I was going to have to crawl down to the nearest road to get a ride to urgent care. But, I brought my sleeping bag out into the grass and slept under the stars in the breeze. I was finally able to sleep until morning. Everyone at the shelter was so kind, giving me salt tablets, electrolyte chews, and helpful advice. When I woke up, I actually felt okay so we decided to continue with our original plan and hike 8 miles to the next shelter, an easy day. It may have been too easy because we reached the shelter at 1:30 in the afternoon. We had a whole day yet to take advantage of. After waiting out a small thunderstorm, we chose to extend our day and do another 7 miles, almost double what we originally planned. The blisters across the pads of my feet popped like balloons near the end. I was dragging myself along, but we made it to the HIKER'S ONLY campground. There is a great sense of community here. A woman even brought some trail magic for all of us that consisted of fresh berries, whipped cream, and ice cream sandwiches. I also got a hot shower and got to chat with a few people I was missing at home. I'm looking forward to the next two days where we will only be hiking a 10-mile day and a 6-mile day until we reach Harper's Ferry! Yay for a town and a hotel!!!","Cowall Shelter

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570715,"Since Yardsale encouraged me to hike the 14 miles yesterday to get to the hiker's campground, today was meant to be my day. I woke up at 9:30 and we headed to a fabulous brunch at a Old South Mountain Inn. I loved being able to have orange juice and eggs. We rolled out at noon for a ten mile day. It seemed to drag on and on. The heat definitely got to us today. I had sweat dripping off of every part of my body. The best sight today was a war correspondence memorial with ruins and an empty tomb. We also saw an old tombstone along the side of the trail. It was very cool to be walking through hallowed ground from the Civil War. It makes the trip a lot more meaningful. I started to feel a bit dehydrated again towards the end of the day, so I was thankful for the electrolyte packet the woman gave me yesterday. I will definitely be buying more of those and some comfy insoles in Harper's Ferry. The Ed Garvey Shelter is packed tonight!","Dahlgren Backpack Campground

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570780,"I woke up with the sun this morning around 5:30. We hiked 6 miles down the mountain and along the Potomac River to Harper's Ferry, WV. Mom and I have now completed two states on the AT! Tomorrow we will be finishing West Virginia and heading into Virginia. We are doing two ""Neros"" (nearly zero miles) in Harper's Ferry. HF was such a welcome sight. We ran into so many hikers that we made friends with on the trail as they finished their journeys. My mom's friend, Deanna, met us at a pub where we ate plentifully and I drank 3 cokes! I headed to the hiking outfitter to get some advice on my blisters. She hooked me up with some blister-free socks and gel pads for the balls of my feet. She was a life saver! I believe we were the 386th and 387th section hikers this year to register at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Having someone in town to take care of us is such a luxury. What would be incredibly difficult tasks for a hiker are made so easy with a friend in town. Drinking a soda, using shampoo and body wash, buying groceries, and just being able to drive in a car are some of the little things that we take advantage of in real life, but are such a blessing on the trail!","Ed Garvey Shelter

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570862,"Since Dee was in Harper's Ferry, we had a nice breakfast at our hotel and a nice lunch in town. I had a refreshing few beers to get my mind off having to return to the trail this evening. The climb out of HF was a steep 1.5 mile ascent in 90 degree weather. My clothes were soaked in sweat! That being said, I can feel my body getting stronger every day. I can go longer without taking breaks and the hills have less of an effect on me. While Yardsale was hanging our bear bag tonight in a nearby tree, I was laying down in the tent. As she walked back to me, she saw a furry tail sticking out from my side of the tent! I had no clue, but there was a skunk two feet away!!! Yardsale chased it away, while I laughed my ass off in the tent. Wish I would have got a glimpse of it though. At this point, I'm struggling to find a reason to continue on the trail. I just don't see the point of exerting myself to sickness. The heat is really getting to me. In addition, Yardsale ends up doing most of the camp setup because I'm just so exhausted. I may feel different in the morning, but at this point, I might be home earlier than I thought.","Harper's Ferry

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571068,"This morning I was still ready to go home. It was hard to find the will to keep going because my body hasn't been cooperating. However, I'm using that as a reality check and choosing to listen to my body and know my limits. A flat, pleasant trail led us to our shelter for the night at Blackburn AT Center. On the way, we saw 4 or 5 deer very close to the trail. I even walked up on a mama turkey and her 10 babies! I almost ran into her because I wasn't paying attention. It was amazing to see them so close. The shelter here consists of a stone house for the caretaker and ridgerunner with a screened-in porch for hikers to eat, charge their phones, and relax in some adirondack chairs. It is luxurious. Then there is a hiker cabin with bunks to sleep, but many of us chose to sleep on the porch to be close to all the amenities. Falling asleep to the rain is quite nice on the porch with the breeze. Tomorrow is going to be another story. I'm not sure what we'll end up doing if it rains all day long. Pray for nice weather!","Key's Gap
",Blackburn AT Center,"Jul 05, Wed",6
Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571070,"I was too chilly sleeping on my lawn chair last night at Blackburn. And it was still pouring when I woke up. Thankfully, the caretaker left coffee and donuts for us to enjoy. Since the rain didn't look like it was going to let up, we tightened our boot straps, threw on a poncho, and continued south. I was suprisingly optimistic for such a crappy day and it stopped raining after about two hours of hiking. This was just in time for us to enter the part of the trail called the Roller Coaster, a 13.5 mile section of repetitive inclines and declines with no flat trail. We are now in the middle of the Roller Coaster at Bear's Den Hostel. It is an old, stone home with bunks on the lower level for hikers. The caretakers open the house to hikers from 5 pm to 9 am and offer a Hiker Special consisting of a bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, ice cream, and soda, as well as access to the hiker lounge with a tv, bathroom, couches, and fans. There are about 15 hikers bunking here tonight. Only 5 more days on the trail!","Blackburn AT Center

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571271,"With a wonderful night's sleep in a bunk at Bear's Den and pancakes and coffee for breakfast, I was ready to face the rest of the Roller Coaster. We climbed and descended 6 peaks in 10 miles today. It kicked my ass, but we did it and made it to Rod Hollow Shelter. That is one ride I never want to ride again. Not much to report today except it was the first day that I felt strong and could put in a lot of miles.","Bears Den Hostel
",Rod Hollow Shelter,"Jul 07, Fri",10
Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571315,"I did not sleep well at all at Rod Hollow. I was freezing because it rained, and I heard that there were centipede and ticks in the shelter so I was freaked out all night. Plus, my hips hurt so bad from doing the Roller Coaster that day. Reluctantly, Yardsale got me out of bed because there was a weirdo at the shelter and we didn't want to be there alone with him. I started off very clumsy, slipping off stones into the creek and peeing right down my leg. Our first climb opened up into rolling fields of grass and wildflowers on top of the mountain. It was beautiful. On our way down, a big black snake was layed across the trail sunning itself. Later in the evening, we heard a crashing in the woods and out popped a young bear 15 feet in front of us! It was so scared, it scrambled across the trail and into the woods. I felt so bad for scaring the poor thing. That was our first bear encounter on the trail. We also reached our highest point in elevation on the trail, too. It was a long day after hiking 13 miles, but I chose to set up our tent so I stay warmer and a little more cozy than in the shelter.","Rod Hollow Shelter
",Manassas Gap Shelter,"Jul 08, Sat",13
Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571475,"I woke up to a hiker shaking my tent to wake me up thanks to my mom. He was a funny guy, though. It was a long day out there. We are getting into bigger and bigger mountains as we reach the Shenandoahs, so every day is tougher than the last. At 10 miles, we stopped at Mountain Home Cabbin, a B&B for hikers that also provides a small food resupply. They had a little kitchen for hikers to hang out. We heated up some pizza for dinner while we recharged. It was a very cute place, and it was very tempting to stay the night there. But we trudged on another 3 miles into the mountains to stay at Tom Floyd Shelter which is at the Shenandoah Nat'l. Park's northern border. It's obvious we are near the park because hikers have been seeing bears everywhere. There are even a few roaming around the shelter tonight, though I haven't seen any yet. I'm a bit nervous to sleep here surrounded by bears, but I'll be keeping my glasses and flashlight on all night just in case. I finally feel like I have my hiker legs again, and we only have two more days out here. However, I'm looking forward to curling up on the sofa, reading a book, and doing nothing all day long.","Manassas Gap Shelter
",Tom Floyd Shelter,"Jul 09, Sun",14
Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571630,"As the sun was coming up, I sat up in my sleeping bag to see two bears huffing down the trail towards the stream. In this area, water is scarce so hikers have to share with the bears. We crossed into Shenandoah State Park early this morning. It felt so bad ass to get my backcountry permit to camp in the wild. Out of the 16 miles we hiked today, at least 10 of them were going up hill. My legs are mush after today. I couldn't make my legs go any further at times. But the views were amazing. We were so high, it was like we were in the clouds. At each view point, we could see all of the mountains we climbed since the morning. The reason we pushed so hard today was to reach Elkwallow Wayside Restaurant. All along Skyline Drive are waysides for tourists and campers to eat and resupply. I was looking forward to a great burger and a milkshake after having such a long, slow hike. Sadly, another hiker told us the wayside closed at 6:00 pm, not 7:00 pm. We were 45 minutes too late. I can't think of many other things that are so defeating as purposely putting in big miles only to find out you won't be getting your reward at the end. Instead, we ate couscous and a tuna packet. Luckily, there was a nice cozy spot under a pine tree for us to camp tonight. I hope I can walk tomorrow after the beating my legs took climbing those mountains!","Tom Floyd Shelter

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581534,"Well I survived the first day of freezing, snowy hiking. I managed to stay dry and warm, despite my shoes not being meant for winter hiking. That was my only worry going into today because they’re not waterproof. George, our shuttle driver, dropped us off at Culver’s Gap where we left off in November. We started north from there. At the beginning, we could follow other hikers’ footprints through the 1 1/2 inches of snow, but those eventually disappeared until we were walking on fresh snow. The most difficult part of the hike today was staying on the trail because the white blazes blended in with all of the white on the ground and trees. Eventually, the snow got deeper and deeper, to about 3 inches. With each inch, it became harder and harder to lift my feet through the snow. Yard Sale and Campbell are both tall, so I was hiking so fast with my little legs just to keep up! We climbed up to Culver’s firetower and Sunrise Mountain, where there is a beautiful stone pavilion. At one point, a fox or coyote entered on to the path, and we were following his tracks down the trail for several miles. It was like he was leading the way for us. After 8.7 miles, George was waiting for us at the next road crossing. We arrived back at our motel for the night, only to be freezing cold after the sweat dried on our skin. It felt like forever waiting for the heat to turn on in the room. Tonight, we will be getting a warm meal and recovering in order to hit the trail again tomorrow.","Culver’s Gap (U.S. 206)
",Deckertown Turnpike,"Dec 26, Tue",8.70
Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581618,"I woke up this morning with my hips so sore. I took some advil and continued getting ready. Before we knew it, George was at the door to pick us up, but I rushed out the door without my hiking poles! I rely on them so much to stop me from slipping or falling, to help me up steep hills, or to rest on. I was so pissed I forgot them! I did feel more like a mountain woman with my makeshift walking stick, though. The first four miles of our day were rocky and hilly. We had to climb down two rock faces which definitely slowed us down. Much to my surprise, however, we came upon the state park headquarters for High Point along the trail. Being able to warm up and eat lunch comfortably was such a luxury. The secretary even made us coffee to warm our bellies. There are such kind people along the AT. Again, we headed out in the cold to reach High Point monument, the highest point in New Jersey. It was all down hill from there. Eventually, we came out to rolling meadows where we climbed over countless stone walls. Back in the day, these walls used to denote property lines. It’s amazing to see such history that no one else would see unless they were walking the trail. Originally, we told George to pick us up after 10.7 miles, but feeling confident, we decided to go another two miles or so before dark. We walked through farm fields and along several private ponds, continuing our journey north. The fields turned into swamps with wooden planks to walk on in order to get through. Some of the planks were two feet above water underneath. It would have been very dangerous for me to slip and fall into the water in 18 degree weather. And with two inches of snow on the planks, they were very slippery. After a mile of plank walking, George was beeping his horn at us from the road as the sun was setting. It was a long day, but necessary in order to reach New York before the end of our trip.","Deckertown Turnpike
",Unionville Rd,"Dec 27, Wed",13.20
Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581651,"Ken, our shuttle driver today, dropped us off at Unionville, where we left the trail last night. It was six degrees. After a few rolling hills through the woods, we ended up on a road which we followed for a half mile. The road led to a wildlife refuge consisting of marshy land for bird watching. I ate some Gu and a granola bar. The AT followed the perimeter of the whole refuge. It was very pretty. At this point, I realized my water bottle spilled in Ken’s car, so I ran out of water. From there, we climbed Potchuck Mountain, scrambling over boulders in the snow the whole way up. The Potchuck shelter was a welcome spot to rest and have some lunch. I had been carrying a water bottle full of snow inside my jacket, hoping it would melt so I could drink it. It was still frozen when we got to the shelter. Then, I tried to melt some snow in a pot on our cook stove, but the stove would not stay lit due to the cold. After five minutes, our bodies started to get cold again, so we had to keep moving. I knew we would be crossing a few streams, so I could get water there. It didn’t register that all of those streams would be frozen solid. Then I began to worry. Towards the end of the day, the trail opened up to a long boardwalk through marshland again. It twisted and turned throughout the flatlands. The boardwalk was such a welcome sight after climbing Potchuck. We were almost at the road crossing to get picked up. I was definitely starting to wear out. However, after a short way, Yard Sale realized she lost her phone. The last thing I wanted to do was walk backwards, farther away from our shuttle drive home. Once she found it, we turned around again, crossed a railroad track and climbed a stile into a cow pasture headed towards Route 94. The trail passed through many different sceneries today, some very difficult parts and some so simple you wouldn’t believe it was actually the Appalachian Trail. I’ve learned to embrace every piece of this long journey north. Today was also a day of lessons learned, being that there were many factors I didn’t consider when winter hiking that I will be sure to take into account next time. Looking forward to completing New Jersey tomorrow and stepping foot in New York!","Unionville Rd

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581659,"As soon as we entered the trail this morning, a daunting mountain laid ahead of us. It was very intimidating. Boulders as big as cars were strewn along the path. It’s crazy that after hiking 400 miles of the AT, these big climbs still intimidate me. Slowly, we made our way up the “stairway to heaven.” It was well worth it. We could see everything we hiked so far. The rest of the day was bunch of ups and downs, with every ascent feeling excruciating because of the huge climb we had done at the start of the day. At one point, we had to climb up a rock face one by one. By the end of the day, the scenery was green and the stones were beautiful shades of maroon, green, and white with snow on top. We had decided to take a side trail down the mountain to Greenwood Lake at the New York border so our day wasn’t so long. Not being familiar with this blue trail, it was a gamble to, first, be able to find the trail and then, how reliable it would be on the way down. We found the trail easily but had to touch the NY state lime before we left the AT! Slightly ahead, there were three yellow blazes around a rock. In the middle was aspray painted line with NY on one side and NJ on the other. We made it! The blue trail down felt like miles because I knew our journey would be over once we got to the bottom. Ken, our shuttle driver, came walking up the trail with his dog to meet us. We came out right at Greenwood Lake Marina where his truck was warm and waiting for us. I felt a ton of emotions finishing my 4th state on the AT. I felt proud and accomplished, but also didn’t want the trip to end! Til next time!","Route 94

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595761,"Amanda and Bob dropped us off at Thornton Gap around 1:30 after a 5 hour drive from home. We immediately climbed 1,000 feet to Mary’s Rock which had an amazing view. By that time, my clothes and backpack were soaked with sweat. However, I was happy that I was able to climb the uphill so easily compared to last summer. It feels great to know that I am in such better health! Slowly we climbed, up and down, up and down. When I first started hiking the AT, I would always mistake dark tree trunks for bears and jump out of my skin! Ironically, as I was strolling along with my sunglasses on today, I mistook a bear for a tree trunk. The bear was 20 feet off trail, pawing at the ground, looking for food. Later on, I walked up on a bear who skirted into woods before us. It turned out there was a hiker on the other side of him, too, who was taking a video. It could have been a potentially dangerous situation if the bear hadn’t taken a left into the woods. Nearing the end of a 10-mile day, Stony Man Cliffs felt like such an accomplishment. It’s the highest point in Shenandoah National Park. Two friendly deer greeted us at the top, as well. Descending to Skyland Resort, we set up our hammocks just past the entrance. By that time, I was getting hangry. It felt great to indulge in a sweet potato and pulled pork melange with grilled shrimp as the sun set. Tomorrow morning, we will return to Skyland for a big breakfast before continuing south.","US-211, Thornton Gap
",Skyland Resort,"Jun 29, Fri",9.50
Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595924,"Last night, I slept perfectly content in my hammock, only waking up once or twice to readjust. Yard Sale woke me up at 6:45 this morning. We planned to break down camp and pack up in time to be at breakfast at Skyland Resort at 7:30. For once, I woke up on time. I had a delicious breakfast of eggs, potatoes, bacon, apple juice, and coffee. A good breakfast on the trail is rare, so I enjoyed every second of it. The morning’s hike consisted of walking a ledge along the side of the mountain. Water was trickling down the rock face to our left. Having frequent water sources makes the whole day better. First of all, I didn’t have to carry an extra 3 lbs. of water like I had to yesterday. In addition, I was able to maintain hydration throughout the day, improving my energy level and stamina. Usually, we chug water at the water source and only drink from our bottles when necessary because we have to conserve. We had to fill up at Byrd’s Nest #3 hut, where much to our surprise, a ton of trail magic was in the bear box! Supplies for smores, candy, and even fresh cherries were left for us hikers. Yard Sale loved the cherries. A little later, the trail bordered Big Meadows campground and, we thought, brought us right to Big Meadows Wayside. However, we came upon the sign that led to the wayside which told us it was 0.4 miles away, uphill. The decision between eating a great meal or avoiding a climb was difficult, but lunch was so worth it. Hiker hunger kicked in immediately. I got a BLT, fries, and even a blackberry milkshake! The wayside was busy with flocking tourists, so it wasn’t the relaxing siesta we had hoped for. I was happier in the woods even if I was exhausted from the miles already under my belt. From there, the trail became flat and smooth, a direct route to our intended destination for the night. Along the way, we approached a family who pointed out a buck resting in the shade under a tree. He was in full velvet with an eight-point rack, scratching at his antlers. Nature sure blessed us today. A mile later, another buck jumped off the trail. He, too, was in velvet. Feeling upbeat from all of the treats we ate today, Yard Sale and I decided we could continue a little farther than we planned. We flew past our destination without thinking twice. Three miles ahead was Bearfence Mountain Hut where we could be comfortable for the night. Shortly after passing Bootens Gap, I spied a bear on the hill, intently watching us. It felt odd. A few hundred yards later, rustling through the woods, a yearling hopped out onto the trail in front of us. The first bear must have been it’s mother. For some crazy reason, we decided it would be fun to do Bearfence rock scramble after already hiking 14 miles. It was a lot of fun, though, and the view was 360 degrees of the Shenandoah range. Bearfence Mountain Hut is full tonight. We ran into Snow White who we met hiking through Pennsylvania last year. In addition, 3 thru-hikers, a section hiker, and 10 over-nighters are staying here, too. Til tomorrow! Hike on!","Skyland Resort

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595956,"This morning, I awoke to a screech owl and another owl talking back and forth at 5 a.m. It sounded like a girl screaming. Thankfully, I fell back asleep until the overnighters were frying bacon and brewing coffee which they were kind enough to share with us. I could have sleep another three hours. My body needed the rest after yesterday’s sixteen miles. My legs were pretty tired. It felt like I was moving in slow motion along the trail. Finally, there were raspberries along the trail that were ripe enough to eat! I am obsessed with wild raspberries. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one because a bear was eating the berries on the other side of the bush, too. Yard Sale and I were dreading the last three miles of the day because the guidebook showed a huge climb up Hightop Mountain. Our legs were already dead from the day before, and my feet felt like they were being hit with a meat tenderizer with every step. The climb was not fun. It was rocky and washed out, so I was basically hiking in a drainage ditch for 3 miles. The view was beautiful, though. Once we arrived at Hightop Mountain Hut, I soaked my feet in the spring to alleviate the swelling and tenderness I felt. It was so cold, I only lasted 4 minutes. I debated hiking on a few more miles, but I think my body needs the rest. Hopefully tomorrow, we will be back to hiking big miles. i also learned that the bug bites I have been getting are from black flies. So that’s lovely. Too bad I sweat off any bug spray within an hour.","Bearfence Mountain Hut

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596060,"I awoke at 8:00 with the sun shining in my eyes. It was a quiet night and I felt well rested after 11 hours of sleep. I took some time to stretch my legs before starting out today which helped a lot. The day consisted of several climbs and dips, probably 4 mountains in total. I was flying up those hills! At one peak, Yard Sale and I took a rest at a lookout over the hollow. Four thru-hikers soon joined us. They were fun to hang out with for a little while. Soon enough, one climb took it all out of me. I was already out of breathe and soaked with sweat, when the gnats started buzzing around my face and my ears. I had three different bugs fly in my eye, and every time I tried to get them out, the sweat burned my eye so bad. My eye burned for hours. I finally got pissed off enough to put on my bug net after all that. At the top, we arrived at a nice lookout where some bikers were taking a break, too. The view was shortly ruined when I got stung by a bee. My luck eventually turned around when we crossed Ivy Creek. The creek was flowing fast. It looked so refreshing, I immediately started dumping cups of water on my head. From there, the last climb would lead us to Loft Mountain Wayside, but it looked like the worst climb yet. There were two side trails that led to the wayside, but the first one was .6 miles long. Therefore, I assumed we’d take the shorter one that was all the way at the top of the mountain. To my amazement, the longer side trail was downhill! It was so worth the longer walk, and the trail spit us out directly in front of the wayside. I got a cheese dog, cheese fries, blackberry ice cream, and dr. pepper. From there, I assumed we’d have to get back on the AT for another two miles to Loft Mountain Campground where we planned to stay for the night. Actually, there was a paved trail that led right to the camp store. At the store, there were bathrooms, showers, and a laundry room. However, the showers were occupied, so we decided to continue walking up the dang hill to the campground, only to find out we needed to find our own spot. I did not want to continue walking, looking for a spot that may or may not be available. I was annoyed already by the day I was having. So, we walked back down to the camp store to wash our clothes. It felt so good to take a shower and be clean after four days of hiking, even though the shower was timed for only 5 minutes. Instead of staying at the campground, we had to walk back down to the AT to find a place to setup for the night. I was hoping for a change of pace tonight, but once again, we are alone in the woods.","Hightop Mountain Hut

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596142,"Well last night was a little scary. Around 11:30, I woke up to an animal walking through the leaves near my hammock. I listened and waited. It got closer. I was too nervous too peek out from behind my tarp, so I just shut my eyes really tight and prayed it would move on. That probably wasn’t the smartest strategy. Yard Sale actually got up and turned the light on to see a pair of eyes staring at us about 20 feet away. She yelled and yelled, and it finally scampered off. It sure sounded like a bear, but we weren’t able to see anything but the eyes. I spent the next hour straining to listen for even the smallest noise in the woods but eventually fell back asleep til morning. Typically, we’ve been seeing bears in the evening, but this morning, three little cubs came scampering through the woods. Mama bear was close behind and intently watching us while the cubs climbed the tree. They were adorable peeking out from behind the limbs. A few yards further, another bear (maybe papa bear?) was to our left. We are in a section now that does not have a water supply for twelve miles, so we filled every single bottle we had at Blackrock Hut. We also decided it would be wise to make our dinner while we were there, so that we didn’t need water for that later. I’ve never tried a cold soak on the trail before, but many hikers do it. I poured 2 cups of cold water in my ziploc bag of rice and let it soak until I got the camp tonight. It was perfectly hydrated by that time and tasted like cold pasta salad. I’d definitely do a cold soak again, rather than soending the time to cook at night. In other news, the heat this afternoon was ungodly. My lunch did not settle well. I thought my tuna was going to end up on the side of trail. Both mountains this afternoon were broken into three peaks where the trail climbed for a while, dipped down, and climbed again. The step-ups made it feel like I climbed the mountain three times in a row. I couldn’t wait to collapse at camp. After surviving today, I am excited we are over half way finished! And tomorrow, we will be picked up by Stanimal’s hostel to stay in Waynesboro for the night. Hopefully, there will be some Fourth of July activities to get our mind off the trail.","Loft Mountain Campground

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596258,"After having a bear in camp the other night, I had a terrible time falling asleep last night, jumping at every little sound. Then, I actually did hear something walking around. I purposely slept without my tarp and with my headlamp and glasses on my head, just in case. I whipped open the zipper to my hammock and saw a deer wandering about the woods. This deer circled our campsite all night long. Eventually, I got so tired of jumping up to see what the noise was.  I now consider this a sign of comfort from nature. I slept soundly knowing the deer was doing circles around us. GRAPHIC LADY DETAILS AHEAD. MEN, DO NOT READ. In the morning, I got out of bed and noticed some blood on the ground where I was standing. I said, “Mom, there’s blood on the ground,” without realizing the blood was my own. I typically don’t get my monthly “visitor” due to being on a specific birth control, but it came today. I was utterly shocked and unprepared, so I had to get creative to stay sanitary until I could get to Waynesboro tonight for supplies. I happened to be out of toilet paper, too, so I placed a dried out wet wipe down there. Once I started hiking, I prayed I would come across another female to ask for some tampons. The first girl didn’t have any, but five minutes later, a thru-hiker gave me one. The trail does provide! I got over my chagrin after that. The rest of the day went pretty quickly besides the last two miles. It felt like we’d never get out of the woods! My guidebook wasn’t accurate in the mileage either. Finally, the trail spit us out at Rockfish Gap where we were to be picked up by Stanimal’s hostel for the night. They had burgers and beer waiting for us and a few decorations for the holiday. It felt great to stand in a long, hot shower, wash my clothes, and get some supplies for the rest of our trip. Many of the hikers here are injured and taking time off to heal before returning to the trail. I have so much sympathy for them, not being able to achieve their dreams. For tonight, I get to sleep in a bunk in an air conditioned room. It’s better than heaven.","Turk’s Gap

Fireworks and partying were going on outside my window, but I slept soundly in my bunk all night long. In the morning, Stanimal gave us day packs to do a 19-mile slack pack. We were able to leave all of our gear at the hostel, and only brought snacks, water, and bug spray on the trail. Many hikers suggested doing this section northbound for the sake of the ascents, so we heeded their advice and flipped for the day. I was shocked how fast I could move without my pack on. The first ten miles flew by. It was overcast and dark in the woods. We didn’t see daylight all day long. The Paul C. Wolfe shelter was a nice spot for lunch. It was a very cool shelter with windows and a privy with a half door! I began to tire out after 15 miles. We came across a small cemetary with unmarked graves and ruins of a cabin. A few miles later, we emerged from the woods at Rockfish Gap again after a 19-mile day, my longest day on record. Our shuttle driver then took us back to the hostel where I showered, ate a whole frozen pizza, and watched netflix. Again, I was in bed at 8:00. This morning, we rose early to get on the trail before the rain. I hate hiking in the rain.","Reed’s Gap

We were dropped off at Reed’s Gap again, this time headed south. Three Ridges Mountain was the first big mountain to summit. It went fairly easily, but I was still worn out from the day before. Then, we climbed way down into a valley to Harper’s Creek. It was very pretty and the shelter was a great spot for lunch. I could have fell asleep there for hours. Luckily, the rain held off all day for us! The breeze was fantastic, though. I was slightly less sweaty! The Priest loomed over us, then. It was intimidating to see a mountain over 4,000 feet in front of us with 4 miles of incline. It felt like we were never going to summit. Just when I thought we were close, the trail turned again. Then, it started to rain. At first, the rain was refreshing. I was able to cool off, but I began to worry if it was ever going to stop. Continuous rain would have made for an even more miserable climb. I prayed the rain would stop again until we got to the top and it did! Yard Sale and I still had 2 miles to climb. My legs burned with every step. I felt like collapsing along the side of the trail. Somehow I completed the climb. The shelter at the top was a relieving sight to see as it was raining once again. I can rest easy knowing I will be dry for the night.","Reed’s Gap

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596597,"This morning, the temperature dipped down to 50 degrees. I only had a little down-feathered quilt for warmth because the forecast did not call for such cold temps. It took me a while to emerge from my covers and start getting ready for the day. I only packed shorts and tank tops for the trip, but Yard Sale let me borrow her rain jacket for a while. All morning, my hands were cold, even while hiking. Our first stop for the day was at Spy Rock. I ate a snack at the bottom, but didn’t feel like walking to the view because my legs were awfully sore from hiking the Priest the day before. However, I got too cold sitting there, so I decided to climb up the rock scramble to the lookout. It was one of the best views, looking up at Three Ridges Mountain and the Priest which we had climbed yesterday. After that, it seemed like the day dragged on forever because it was our final day in the woods and we were excited to get picked up to head home. The last view from Tar Jacket Ridge was so pretty. The sun was shining; the breeze was blowing. I collected wildflowers on our last mile down to Hog Camp Gap, where Deanna was waiting for us. At the bottom of the hill, we walked through a beautiful meadow where a family was having a picnic. There Dee had the car filled with water and snacks for the ride back to the hotel. I had not planned to have wet clothes from the rain we encountered yesterday, so I didn’t have any clean clothes, but I enjoyed a hot shower. Since many hikers raved about Devil’s Backbone Brewing Co., we decided to head there for dinner and drinks. They were also putting on a festival, Music on the Blue Ridge. The place is a town in itself, with a band stand, campground for hikers, and multiple bars. It was well worth the wait for dinner! At the end of the night, I had to get my favorite milkshake from Cookout, a vanilla malt. I basically passed out in bed with my milkshake in hand, thus ending another once in a lifetime trip on the AT.","The Priest Shelter

I wanted to start my hike on a good note, with an early start and a full belly. After some scrambled eggs and coffee, we jumped in the car to drive 45 minutes to Hog Pen Gap. My uncle, Bruce, and cousins, Lorelei and Sam, were nice enough to drive us all the way to the hotel last night and stay over to drop us off at the trailhead this morning. (Thanks guys!) As we said our goodbyes, Yardsale and I crossed through the split rail fence to start an easy climb to the top of Cove Mountain, through a forest of ferns. The weather was a brisk 56 degrees. The top of the mountain opened up to a grassy bald with a 360 degree view. What a nice way to start the day. We quickly descended the mountain only to climb another with an equal amount of elevation, Bald Mountain. Bald Mountain isn’t actually bald, like Cove Mountain was. Go figure. Before we knew it, we had hiked 8 miles before 12:15. That was one of my fastest hiking rates with a pack, so I felt pretty great rolling into Brown Mountain Shelter for lunch. The shelter sits along a well-flowing stream that we followed for a couple miles. I laid my head back for no more than 30 seconds, and a little head comes bobbing up to the shelter. It was Platypus! We met at Trail Days last month and got to know each other because she is hiking for Hike for Mental Health. Only pure coincidence led us to having lunch together at the same shelter in the 500 miles of trail through Virginia. The rest of the afternoon, the trail meandered through the woods along the side of the mountain above a stream with little room for missteps. By 3:00 pm, we had made it to our intended destination for the night, a suspension bridge above a nice creek with flat grass for camping. Sadly, we left that perfect spot behind since it was still early in the day. Instead, we chose to hike another two miles uphill to Rice Mountain in order to get ahead on the big elevation change that is awaiting us tomorrow. Let me tell you, those two miles felt like they would never end. Every time I thought it was over, I saw more trail heading uphill. I was drenched in sweat. 0.2 miles from the top, Yardsale and I laid out in the middle of trail, completely worn out. We got our bearings and hiked the last bit to the top in order to set up camp for the night. I discovered a few blisters on the tops of my toes. I’m not sure how that happened, considering I haven’t had a blister for two years now. Hopefully they don’t get worse over the next few days. It’s quite breezy up here, but the sun is hitting us perfectly as it sets. I have a feeling I’m going to sleep like a baby in my hammock, tonight.","Hog Camp Gap

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616545,"I tossed and turned in my hammock for most of last night, mainly due to my legs and hips being so sore. We packed up camp, and I chugged my protein shake as we hit the trail. Descending Rice Mountain, we passed a ton of other hikers. Yardsale and I were both dreading the ascent to Bluff Mountain’s peak, as the climb consisted of 1100 feet of elevation gain. It was actually a slow and gradual path to the top which made the amazing view so much better. At the top of the mountain, ruins of a fire tower overlook the lower mountains and towns. There is also a mysterious memorial site of a 4 year old boy who was found dead there. Apparently, he wandered away from his school and ended up 7 miles away at the top of Bluff Mountain. Creepy. I began to feel the excitement of getting off trail for the night, so my pace quickened from there. However, the weather suddenly became extremely hot and humid, slowing me down again. I struggled more through that than any ascent up a mountain. We stopped for lunch at Big Rocky Row overlook which seemed to be the meeting place of the day, as 5 other hikers joined us. From there came an extremely long section downhill. It took over 2 hours to get off the mountain. We zigzagged, rock hopped, slid, and ran all the way to the bottom. Spider webs and gnats waited there for our arrival, while the air became more and more sticky. I, finally, had to stop at John’s Hollow Shelter. We only had 1.7 miles to go, but I desperately needed a break. The trail is a good teacher. No matter how bad I wanted that shuttle ride into town, I couldn’t push my body any further. I had to be patient with myself. By turning my outlook around, I was graced with a beautiful 1.7 miles along a creek, all the way to the James River. Donna, our shuttle driver, was there to take us 6 miles into Glasgow to stay at Stanimal’s Hostel. It felt so good to get out of those sweaty clothes and take a shower! The trail also works in mysterious ways. As soon as we arrived in town, our friend Pringles posted a photo of herself at the shelter here in Glasgow. We quickly ran over to the shelter, and Pringles jumped out of her tent to hug us! We enjoyed a great meal at Scotto’s restaurant together. The hostel is pretty quiet tonight, so I will be spending my night catching up with friends and family at home. Til tomorrow!","Rice Mountain

Our shuttle picked us up at Stanimal’s hostel at 7:00 am for a slack pack which means we only had to carry a day bag with our water and snacks. Because of that, we aimed to complete 20 miles. We hiked into Cornelius Creek Shelter around 8:00. It was a busy shelter the previous night, so many people were still lingering in the morning. The next shelter was also full of thru hikers who stayed at Cornelius last night. Yardsale and I played leap-frog with this group for the rest of the day. I was surprised we kept a steady pace with them! The first view from Thunder Hill overlook was incredible. However, we had many more miles to go. We came up to the FAA tower, a giant satellite sphere, at the top of Apple Orchard Mountain. Then, we descended into The Guillotine, where a spherical rock hangs stuck between two rock faces. It’s quite the wonder to behold considering there aren’t many other rocks in the area. One incline remained, to the top of Highcock Knob. It looks easy on the map, but it was tough considering the sun was beating on us as we climbed through multiple rock mazes. By the time we got to the top, I felt ill with heat exhaustion. I, carefully, walked to the next water source and soaked myself with water and popped another electrolyte tablet. Just as I felt well enough to continue on, it started storming. The sky burst open and poured on us. Trashcan, a thru hiker, reminded us to “embrace it.” It ended up being a great cool down, but my soaked shoes and socks only made my blisters worse. I cringed with every step for the last 4 miles of the day. As we crossed the foot bridge above the James River, we completed a record 20-mile day! The thru hikers were there once again, trying to hitch a ride into Glasgow. We all hopped invthe back of a guy’s pick-up who was nice enough to stop for us all.

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616805,"Just as I was about to fall asleep on the ride to Cornelius Creek again, we pulled in at the trail. The steep down slopes have really done a number on my legs. Because of hiking downhill with so much weight on my back, my knees were painful with every step; my feet felt like they were wailed on with a meat tenderizer; and I think that’s also what caused my blisters. I did change my socks, though, which did the trick! Hopefully, no more blisters. After the descent to Bryant Ridge Shelter, we had three big climbs ahead of us. And only one with a view! We had to hurry because the forecast was calling for rain again, starting at 4:00. At lunch, Yardsale and I swam in Cross Jennings Creek and laid out along the rocks. It felt so good to freeze my feet in the cold water to reduce the swelling and soreness. As we climbed out of the gap to our next peak, I came across a sign saying there was no water at the next shelter. That meant we had to hike a little extra to get to our next water source, so a 13-mile day turned into a 15-mile day. But we beat the rain! And the view from Cove Mountain, looking over all the terrain we hiked today, was beautiful. I set up camp just in time for the rain to start. All we needed was some dinner, yet, which was easy. Yardsale dehydrated stuffing, chicken, and craisins for us. It was delicious for a backpacking meal! Usually, I’m stuck with rice and tuna every night. For the rest of the evening, I will be snug in my hammock, staying dry. However, I’m a little nervous about the weather tomorrow. If we have to hike all day in the rain, my sleep system might get too wet to sleep in and my clothes and boots may not dry out for the following day.

The earth was still wet due to the rain the night before, but we packed up our damp gear in hopes of beating the rain once more. Thankfully, the rain pushed back to late afternoon again, so Yardsale and I hiked a good ten miles without an issue. I felt the best I’ve felt since the first day out, probably because I fell asleep at 8:00 pm the night before. Early in the day, we met two SOBO hikers and ran into a SOBO hiker we met the other day. It was fun to have people to talk to at every stop. We all enjoyed talking to each other because we had experienced the same trek. It was a relatively flat day compared to the last 4 days. We crossed Blue Ridge Parkway several times at different view points before we stopped for lunch at Wilson Creek Shelter. We met a bunch of hikers there, too, including Smiley, who was so nice he put us all in a good mood. Yardsale and I had thought about stopping there for the day, but since the rain was holding off, we decided to continue another 6.7 miles to Fullhardt Knob Shelter, knowing we might get caught in the rain. There was quite a climb to the shelter, but I felt strong. Near the top of the first leg, I started to feel raindrops. Honestly, it felt great. It wasn’t raining too hard, but it was just enough to cool me off. It stopped just long enough for me to dry when it started coming down again. It was chilly enough for me to put on my poncho until we climbed to the shelter where I could change into comfy pants and a jacket. I am hoping the skies stay clear tonight because my clothes are hanging above my hammock, drying out. Yardsale and I dreaded seeing a boy scout troop at the shelter. Usually, they take up so much space and make a lot of noise, but these boys were polite and quiet all night. I actually enjoyed talking with them about the trail and our favorite backpacking meals. Yardsale is letting me sleep in tomorrow because we will be having a shorter day. The area we are hiking into only allows camping at designated areas, so we will be quitting early to stay at the shelter at the base of Tinker Cliffs.","Bearwallow Gap

We breezed down 3:6 miles of trail to Troutville, where Silverfox was going to join our adventure. She took us into town to wash up in her hotel room and refill on water since we had to hike 10 miles to the next water source. While we were there, we couldn’t pass up an opportunity for a meal, so we gulped down some McDonald’s and hit the trail before the rain. It was easy to keep pace with the powerline crossings every few miles. We counted them as we went. And there was even some wild blueberries and blackberries along the trail! My day instantly gets better whenever I come across wild berries. The afternoon passed without any rain. The breeze actually kept us cool for most of the day. We eventually ended up at Lambert’s Meadow Shelter at the base of Tinker Cliffs. By that time it was already 7:00 pm. It’s against the rules to camp anywhere other than a designated shelter, but we made it our mission to watch the sunset at the top of Tinker Cliffs. It was only one mile away, but it was a grueling climb, the steepest we have done on this trip. Along the way, we came upon four or five deer which is always neat to see. They aren’t very scared of people around here, so we got pretty close. The last half mile of the climb consisted of cliff walking above a 30 foot drop. The wind was crazy! The sunset was well worth the risk of stealth camping at the top, though. And now we get to enjoy it again tomorrow. Somewhere along the way, I tweaked my left knee pretty bad. I feel a shooting pain under my knee cap every time I step up or down. Now that we stopped hiking, it’s getting pretty stiff. I couldn’t even squat to go to the bathroom!

I have no support whatsoever. Although, I learned how to hike on it without inflicting too much pain by locking my leg straight or walking sideways down the hills. Our first climb today was to McAfee Knob, the most photographed site on the AT. It’s also the second point of Virginia’s Triple Crown. It did not disappoint! We got some amazing photos. We also met a trail maintainer there who asked us where we stayed, etc. to make sure we were following the rules. Luckily, we were able to cover for our illegal camping the night before. Again, bad idea. The rest of day seemed to drag on. There weren’t any points of interest to look forward to, and we were all excited to get to Four Pines Hostel to relax. I put in my headphones to grin and bear it to our final road crossing at VA 624. As we walked up to the road, a former hiker was dropping some people off. She offered to give us a ride to the hostel. That was our 3rd hitch hike on this section! I’m becoming a professional. Four Pines is quite a unique place. It’s a donation-based hostel in a guy’s garage in which he built a bunch of bunks and set up old couches. It kind of feels like a homeless shelter with all of the bunks lined up in rows. They don’t offer towels, toiletries, food, or drinks. If you want to shower, you have to bring your own stuff or drip dry. They do offer laundry, but no dryer, so all of our clothes are going to be wet when we leave. I am wondering if it may have been simpler just to stay on trail, but everyone here is very hospitable and welcoming. The guys shuttle to The Homeplace, where I had all you can eat fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuits, and peach cobbler with ice cream. How divine! And being able to shower and charge my devices was worth the trip. We’ll be hiding out here tomorrow to get some sleep and avoid some of the storms coming in the morning.

Nature Boi drove us to VA 620 where we started the five-mile climb up. It was so pleasant to hike without a pack and with a group of other hikers! Dragon’s Tooth is no joke. The monolith is about 30 feet tall. I climbed half way up to see the view but didn’t dare go any further, especially with a tweaked knee. The climb down was precarious, sliding down rock faces, climbing down ladders, and stepping down over large rocks. Back at the road, we walked the .3 miles back to Four Pines.

Murphy was the most decorated soldier in World War II. He died in a plane crash at that site.

Sidewinder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/628225,"Our stealth campsite turned out to be a good spot for the night. I was warm enough with leggings and a long sleeve shirt. It was quiet until morning when I woke up to rain. Luckily, I brought my pack in my hammock last night. The short, rocky climb from our campsite led to a nice ridge walk over flat rock slabs. The air was cool and refreshing. After a while, I noticed a sharp pain from the ball of my foot into my arch. It was hard to walk over rocks or extend my foot to climb. We made it about 6 miles before I had to wrap it with KT tape. Since we were halfway through the day, we ate lunch and I elevated my feet for a bit. The KT tape was enough to get me through the rest of the hike, but it wasn’t pleasant. Plus there were a lot of inclines from the gravel road where we ate lunch to our parked car. It was hot, too! I sweated a lot but felt pretty good clmbing the ridges. My jeep was such a welcome sight. I could finally take my shoes off and rest my feet. Only one more section of NY for me!","South Mountain Pass

But our hostel was still a half mile away by road, so I gritted my teeth and made it there. I tried to shower the day away, and soaked my clothes in a bucket, hanging them to dry. The hostel owner’s friend was kind enough to drive us to Mizza’s Pizzeria where I hounded down some penne alla vodka and wine. Now, as I lay in bed, my feet continue to throb and flinch from the pain, reminding me of the day they endured.","Belter’s Campsite
