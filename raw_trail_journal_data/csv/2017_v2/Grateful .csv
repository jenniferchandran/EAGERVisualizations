Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553093,"More encouraged today after about four friends have talked to me about my planned AT hike. A group had prayed for me. ""Have you camped before?"" was the common question. ""No, I haven't,"" was my answer. And the more they are interested to know why I want to do this long distance hike. All of them expressed care to make sure I have thought about this carefully before going. I know this is not a joke so I have to better keep up with the expected difficult hike before me.",,More friends are asking ,"Jan 08, Sun",0
Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552997,"I plan to start my hike on April 17, 2017 and preparations had started since October 2016. For someone like me who haven’t done long distance hikes before, it would be a long haul to even prepare for such an ardous mission – yes, mission the purpose for which is still unknown. At least for me, I don’t know what’s attracting people and now that includes me, to do it! And, inspite of that, I feel excited to be part of this crowd who are charmed by it!So the next days and months will surely be a search and research thing for me with a bigger portion of it directed inwards – yes, inwards, for that is what I seek.May God grant me wisdom to discover, understand and confirm my motivations, that my hiking this mysterious and charming trail be according to His will and glorifying to His Name!",,Searching to understand own motivation,"Jan 17, Tue",0
Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553035,"I'm always excited when weekends come. It's because I could practice my hikes for the AT with my husband. It's always nice of him to help me with my backpack whenever I feel tired. And so he did again today after 2 hours when I felt I can't go no farther with the 17 pound on my back.I found our hike particularly difficult today either because the hills are steeper than last week or I need to practice more. The latter I guess. But there is always time to stop and rest, and appreciate the surrounding beauty of nature. The few trees had their leaves all covered by snow individually and beautifully! The trails glowed in white and the actual feel of -7 degree celcius are overshadowed by the beautiful blue sky!""The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."" - Psalm 19:1",,Seneca Ridge Trail practice,"Jan 18, Wed",0
Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553431,"The temp yesterday morning was about 30F and I wanted to test if I could stay out there in that cold temp. So I set up a temporary tent using an old tarp and a shower curtain that was in the storage for a while. I stayed out for about an hour with 4 layers of clothing plus a sleeping bag that has lower comfort level than the one I bought for the AT. I was able to stay in my tent for an hour without feeling uncomfortable and that made me feel good! But I want to do it at night, so I asked my husband if I could sleep in my tent the whole night. My husband said yes so I did. It was 41F with real feel of 40F. But the rain made me cut my mini camping out short. I will find another time when it is not raining to further build my confidence that i can do it even with 30F temps out there.",,Testing the cold,"Jan 18, Wed",0
Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553036,"I received my backpack yesterday, an Osprey Exos 38. I quickly tried it, put all my gear inside and whoah...it's small! While I tried to choose the lightest gear I could within my budget, they just can't fit into the 38L bag. So I got the bag ready for return and ordered the 58L exos. I will get it on Monday, so excited about it!",,"My backpack, trial and error","Jan 19, Thu",0
Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553528,"With my practice some days ago, I feel more confident I could sleep outside at 30-40 temp. Now, I would like to try if I could do the same under rainy condition. Today, in the afternoon, my husband helped me with a better and stronger tent making sure water will not get in and ruin my sleeping bag. There is no rain today but tomorrow it will. At least the forecast says it will. It is 36 degrees outside right now, and I hope I will be able to sleep. I unpacked my bag again, and packed and unpacked, trying to find the best way to arrange my gear and stuff. I'm deciding between putting the bear canister inside my backpack or just empty it and carry it outside my bag. The advantage of having it ourside is that I will have easy access to it and use it as a chair when I rest along the way.   Would be good to know how others carry their bear canister.",,Excited by the day!,"Jan 20, Fri",0
Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553555,So I did for my sleeping ultra light bag which claimed to have a comfort level at -3C (26.6F) but last night it was 41F and I could feel the cold coming inside the bag even after I completely closed the opening and had myself fully covered. I was even wearing a down jacket. It was different the other week when I used my husband's old coleman's cotton-stuffed sleeping bag which we believed has a lesser comfort level than the one i bought but it gave me a comfortable night at 33F outside. So my new sleeping bag is on its way back to the seller today.,,It's advisable to test your gear,"Jan 20, Fri",0
Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553735,"This week had been full with training not for my hike but for a volunteer work to help low income families prepare their income tax returns. I don't know why I can't resist the urge to do something to make use of my time while waiting for the day of my hike - it must be from my belief that life has to be spent in serving others with the hope and prayer that God will be pleased and glorified. The commitment for this volunteer work will be between February and April so time-wise, it will not affect my thru-hike plan.
The training is heavy as a multiple day course was lumped into a a four hour-session! I'm not sure if I will pass the certification test but will try. Would be good to do this before I spend full time hiking the AT. I did some hours on the tread mill, though!",,Volunteering while waiting,"Jan 24, Tue",0

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553866,"The day seemed too long. Sitting in our sofa the whole day, I felt like I needed someone to talk with. Someone who could take my mind away from boredom. So I thought of talking with AT.Me: Why have you started giving me the bug of hiking you?AT: Because I am beautiful, fun, awesome and I can help you forget your boredom and fill the emptiness, if there’s any within you.Me: How? I might be even more bored hiking your endless trail and get too tired to have fun!AT: If you just look around you as you hike, you will not be bored. In fact you will be overwhelmed with awe at the creation of the great Creator who designed me, you and the rest of the world. That sense of awe will fill you with gladness!Me: Oh?AT: Yes, and you won’t be tired if you listen to your body and rest when you want. Enjoy the walk, rest if you may, because I will be there for as long as the great Creator wants me to be there for you and others.Me: Please go on, tell me more.AT: You will see endless trees, endless mountains, endless trail and endless beauty of nature! In it you will see all the combinations and perfect harmony of the perfect God who designed life you are enjoying. You will be filled with food for your spirit that longs to be filled. Just trust the quiet and serenity of my trail and the mountains and hills and valleys that will give you time to commune with your great Creator. And you will be filled with gladness!Me: You get me inspired. But how did you know I am bored or feeling something is empty and needs filling in?AT: I don’t know why I know. But I know. I am just one of the instruments of the power that created you. For some reason beyond my understanding, I knew I am being used or will be used to help you.Me: But why you? Why not another means?AT: Your great Creator is using many means, I am only one of the many. So you see, you have many to choose from. But for me, you will not regret it, don’t you see God’s chosen places of worship for His people are the mountains and high places? I have many of those that God created. You will feel closer to Him as you walk, be wrapped in awe of the beauty of His creation and reach the high places. Only few are able to do that.Me: What if I am not able to make it and give up?AT: As I said, I am only one of the many ways your Creator have to help you with your boredom, or let’s say to help you fill the empty hole you feel inside. If you can’t make it through my whole length, God will always find another way to help you.Me: What could it be, do you know?AT: No. I only know what God has assigned me to do. So you are welcome to accept me and take me and enjoy me.Me: Ok, ok. I admit just looking at the pictures of those who have thru-hiked you, I am charmed. I want to know more about you. But let’s do that later as my husband and I are going to Costco to do some grocery shopping for the week. Bye, AT!AT: Ok, have a good time.",,Dialogue with AT,"Jan 27, Fri",0

Yes, been thinking of doing it alone these past several weeks but always put it off due to my husband's concern that it might not be safe to walk in the woods all by myself. But today, I did it!

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554273,"I've read in some journals about some parts of the trail being narrow and having deep cliffs on one or both sides. The thought scares me as I have altophobic tendencies and can't keep my balance if I know that I'm close to a deep side of the path or point. I feel like I am being pulled down by the depth of my location. For instance, in climbing up a tower during one of our vacations, I can't look down to see the height of my location as I feel like I was falling down! So in the past days, I tried to overcome my fear by walking on raised logs or fallen trees. At first I cannot balance myself and fell many times. But as I practiced, I saw improvements in myself. Today, I walked back and forth in the log in the photo and in some other logs along the trail and I was doing ok in balancing my weight. I didn't fall in any of those! I will try some more, maybe higher and smaller logs in the future. I hope the trails will be wide enough though so as not to scare me!",,Seneca Trail,"Feb 07, Tue",0

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559668,"Saturday. We arrived Rock Fish Gap at almost 1 pm after missing our turn on US 250! Rick typed in similar address -Rockfish Gap instead of Rockfish Gap Visitor Center! I promised him i will give him the exact coordinates but forgot about it! Obviously excited to go, that was why!The hike from the parking lot to the self-regitration kiosk up the side of the hill was not bad – just an elevation gain of 298 feet – but it was our pack that made it strenuous! I carried 39 lbs, don’t know what happened to my practice packing of only 26-29 lbs these past months! I guess it was the fear of getting cold and running out of food that I packed more than what I planned! So here I am struggling to carry 10 lbs more uphill!The first shelter is about 8 miles away and with the limited time before it gets dark plus the feeling of being pressed down by the pack on my back, I told Rick we won’t make it to the shelter. So we replanned. There is a parking area just 2.5 miles from the shelter so why don’t we drive there instead and start out hike there. 2.5 miles sounds reasonable with our pack weight! So we did!But…After the day's experience, I realized that the next shelter which is 13 miles away is too much for me to at this stage. I am not sure i can do it yet. So I decided I will move to North Virginia the next day where shelters are comparatively closer.","Beagle Gap Parking

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559670,"So early this morning we packed our bags and went back to Beagle Gap Parking where we left our car last night. My pack is lighter because my caring and loving husband took some 9 lbs out of it, wrapped them in a separate plastic bag and carry it on his shoulders in addition to his pack! What a sweet hiking companion he is. I wish he will hike with me through out the AT! But he can't - he has a job to go back to on Monday. I just have to wait one month to have him join me for three weeks when I flip flop to Georgia at the end of April. We droved another hour or so up north to start my solo hike at the Tucker's Lane in Linden. The reason for the change from Shenandoah to here is that the shelters in this part of the AT are set closer and fits my slow pace.
It was past 1 pm and the forecast says it will begin to rain in 60 minutes. So I got myself ready for the rain with my poncho and mind (for I honestly was nervous to do this hike alone) set up to go up the mountain of Manassas!","Tucker Lane, Manassas Gap

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559674,"Monday. Last night was my first time to camp alone. The shelter (or lean-to) has only 3 sides walled and the front side wide open. Never in my life I would go to bed without making sure all doors and windows are locked. But here I am this time in the middle of the forested mountain going to sleep alone and in an open house! No lights so I have to depend on my headlamp and cute pen lite Rick gave me. (Oh, I pity seeing him yesterday breathing real hard after running uphill to catch up because I forgot the penlite in his car! Sorry dearest hubby for causing you that trouble yesterday but I appreciate your care and love big time! <3)As I lay awake last night, my prayer was non-stop, asking God that no bear will find his way to the shelter, or any danger! In between prayer, I recalled and compare my situation in the shelter with my normal life - i saw how people including me draw their sense of security from the people around them, from their protective shelters, locked doors, electricity that illuminates every dark corners of the house and around it. Sometimes forgetting the real source of our security. Forgetting to thank Him who provided us of those security. As i was thinking of these, I decided this situation in this dark and doorless shelter is one best chance to fully trust the Lord for protection. I asked forgiveness for the many times I forgot to thank Him for the continued protection He had provided me and my family in many ways.So I survived the first night! Grateful to my Lord for locking my ""imaginary door"" while I sleep! I love the Lord!And today, on to the next shelter - the Dick's Dome/Whiskey Hollow Shelter!","Manassas Gap Shelter

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559676,"I was worried at first about the distance of 8.4. I thought I won’t be able to do it given that my pace is still very slow. Good a fellow hiker who is southbound and had gone that way encouraged me to do it as it was easier than the previous terrain I did. He’s right. I was able to reach the next Shelter without difficulty and while there was still a lot of daylight.
I met two girls, both college students who were on their spring break and doing section hikes. Another guy in his 50’s and two younger men in their 20’s. All were nice and considerate. They made a bonfire right in front of the shelter and talked a lot, laughing and having fun sharing stories.
The next morning, one of them offered to have me cook my lunch in his stove after he learned that I ran out of alcohol fuel. I forgot his trail name now so it is really good to journal right away so no names are missed or forgotten. I’m really getting bad in remembering names, blame my age for that, but I am grateful for my first trail angel*! I wrote about him in the shelter journal so his good deed is recorded on the AT!
* For my readers who asked what is a trail angel: A trail angel is someone who do good things to hikers on the trail. Some offer food, bring or leave food and drinks on the trail. Some invite hikers to their place for shower or stay overnight, or offer a shuttle service.","Dicks' Dome/Whiskey Hollow Shelter

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559677,"I did the 8.4 mile quite well yesterday. I thought I will do better with this 6.9 but I was wrong. Why? Because it is the start - the southern end of the Roller Coaster Challenge of Northern Virginia! The slopes up and down felt endless and strenous - in fact most strenous for my level! So when I arrived at the Sam Moore Shelter, I felt like I won't be able to walk anymore! 
Despite the tired feeling, very tired indeed, I still have to cook my dinner. Since I didnt have any alcohol fuel left, i used the skills I learned from my parents. With the use of 2 stones and dry sticks, I was able to prepare my dinner - rice and beef jerky!","Rod Hollow Shelter

But my husband (is a doting husband, I love him for being so!) convinced me to go and rest and eat pizza and ice cream at Bear's Den so I listened and did what he advised me to do.

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559699,"(Friday). It was raining last night and forecast to rain the whole day today. We knew it will but decided that it's part of my practice. This time, our practice because my husband is coming to join me today and tomorrow! Yay! It also means I get my resupply especially that I ran out of alcohol fuel since Wednesday. So with poncho and my husband's new rain coat from Walmart, we set to go in the rain. Not quite an hour of going up and down the slopes when my husband said he feels weak and would like to check his sugar level. He is diabetic and on insulin injection. He knows when he is low on sugar. It was a hollow part after going down a steep slope, with a stream before us and another uphill after the stream. I was going to go to relieve myself so I told my husband I will go up the trail ahead to find a place away from the stream. I will wait for him there. It was quick for me to return to the trail and looking down on the stream, I saw that my husband was still working on his sugar meter. I had to tighten my shoe lace so I sat down on the nearby rock while waiting for him to come up. Turned on my phone to see if we have a signal up there. Then suddenly I heard one shout. I can't clearly figure out the words but a big echoing shout. I stood up and looked down where my husband was and I couldn't see him there. I looked up on both ends of the trail. especially the south where we came from then to the north ahead of me incase he passed me by but he's not there. I called back. He replied but I cannot tell whether the voice come from the south or from the north. I was almost at the base of two mountains that stood side by side and the sounds that came from me and from my husband echoed back and forth. Where is he? Did he pass me by? Or did he go back?""Rick, come back! You are heading to the wrong direction!"" I shouted as loud as I could. I didn't hear any response. I shouted again. Calling his name. The silence in between my shout and the beating of my heart was deafening! I started to panic. He's definitely on the other side of either moutain I was not sure which. What if he continues walking? I started to panic. The rain continued. Suddenly I heard another shout from him. I'm sure it's him for there's no one in that part of the mountains but us. But the shout sounds like going farther. The more I panicked. I started to want to cry. Where is my husband? I decided to wait. I sat on the rock beside the stream where he checked his sugar earlier. I will wait here, I decided. If he keeps walking he will pass by Bear's Den Hostel where we left our car for sure and he will realize he was on the wrong direction and will come back. If he happened to go north and passed me by without me noticing him, I pray he will realize that he should come back where he lost me. Or each other. I saw a couple coming from the north. I asked them if they saw someone (I described what he was wearing, what his pack look like, etc) on their way, they said no. I asked them that if they see someone with the description I gave as they continue south, that they should tell him i am waiting at the stream. Then as I was sitting there, sad and regretting why I did not wait for him before going for the toilet, I saw a guy coming down the slope south of me. Then another. Though it was foggy, I'm sure it was Rick! I leapt with joy seeing him. Oh, Lord, thank you for bringing back my husband! I told him I heard him shouting or calling me, and I kept calling him back. He said he didn't hear any of my shouts. He just decided to come back when he asked the guy if he had seen a woman and he said no. That's the time Rick decided to come back. I promised I will never leave my husband on the trail like that again. He had his sugar went down to 58 and that could be the reason he lost direction.

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560433,"Thankful to spend the Sunday with my husband and meet church friends yesterday. Grateful too that my husband's colleague, Kim and their boss were ok with my hubby swapping start time with Kim so he can drive me to the trailhead at Keys Gap. 7:30 am is a good time to start. I was first to hit the trail that morning and took me an hour or so to see a couple then a solo day-hiker with her three dogs. In less than an hour, passed by a tentsite for two tents, and a fire ring, Must be an unofficial tentsite. Then after about 2 miles, saw another wider tentsite, with a firering. I won't stay in this site unless I happen to underestimate my hike and it's midnight when I reach this site. But it looks like a good site, only that i'm not fond of staying out if I could make it to a shelter. The terrain is not bad, except for my foot getting tired of the rocks that lined most of the trail length up to Harper's Ferry. Had my lunch before the bridge at Shenandoah River, a very relaxing view of the rushing waters and the mountains at the backdrop. I re-started walking toward the Harper's Ferry's Hostel which says on the map as a little more than 3 miles from HF. Trekked the steep slope from the C&O Canal to the hostel for about 20 minutes only to find out that the hostel is still closed for the season! I had no choice then but to continue walking to the next shelter - the Ed Garvey Shelter! My feet are tired and hurting, my right ankle feeling some blister starting to form out. I didn't want to go back to the C&O Canal as going down that steep slope would be more difficult than coming up and I don't trust my knees anymore than my ankles which I feel like crambling down anytime! But I have to walk, I have to, otherwise I will be standing there on the trail or setting up a tent where it is not legally allowed! I followed the winding road from the 'still closed hostel' to the point it meets the AT, a 1.2 mile stretch. Narrow and without a pedestrian sidewalk, I nervously shared the road with speeding cars on both ways! For who would not be nervous walking alone, surprisingly for those drivers Im sure, with blind curves on both sides so narrow, with steep drop on one side and a rock wall on the other. I was praying all the time!It was almost dark when I reached Ed Garvey Shelter, what for the tired knees and legs, blistered feet and already very slow pace! I was releived though that I won't be spending the night alone - two guys and a woman in their mid twenties were there ahead of me and were jolly! 
The night was windy and I din't regret choosing to sleep on the second floor despite a steep and narrow stair going up. I heard the wind woozing back and forth during the night and could imagine the cold the other three people sleeping on the open first floor must have. 
I slept well, not alone but with another guy just 2 feet away on the same floor. He was there before me, but went down and chatted with the other guys quite late that I did not notice anymore when he came up to sleep. I woke up early and got ready early, not cooking anything because I didn't have enough water left and the water source is .4 mile down a steep slope from the shelter so I decided to go and cook my food in the next shelter, the Crampton Gap Shelter which is only 4.1 miles north. 
Yeah, 4.1 miles for the day is enough after the 13 miles of yesterday made me feel so worn out!","Keys Gap

Of course I look forward to go back tothe trail the next Monday. 
Along the way, I stopped by the White Rock Overlook and took a picture using Keith's gopro cam and then continued my hike. There were about 6 people I saw hiking, most of them southbound.

We intended to drive straight to Springer but since it is late, we stopped by Haiawasee, Georgia and stayed overnight at Budget Inn Hostel. It's a decent place, clean and staff (David) was very helpful. He Allows us to park our Car here for 2 weeks. He also gave us contacts for shuttle service to Springer.

He said he too didnt sleep well but the three hours of sleep was good enough for him. I left at 6:20 am for a slack pack for 8 miles with the help of my husband. He met me at PA 183 parking area.

There were a lot of trail magics that day: drinks from Earn Hart who gave cod drinks, another old guy gave out starbucks coffee, a couple gave water and galaxy gave me some coffee! I met Don Gunthook, Galaxy and Milky Way, Spiderman, and many others! We all (eight of us) stayed at the Pavilllion of Port Clinton Hotel.

We planned to start at Tuckers Lane and go to Jim and Molly Denton Shelter then back to our car but later decided to continue hiking towards Rt 522 where Moutain Home is to spend the night or get a taxi back to our car if there is still daylight when we arrived. So we did and by God's blessings, while we were trying to call Uber, a bus was going back to town and the driver even went down his bus and asked us if we want to go to town for a $.50 per head. We thought it is a good idea to get a taxi there since it is just 2:30 pm so we did. He dropped us at the Goodwill Store beside the grocery store in Front Royal and we tried (3x) to get Uber but when we did not succeed we tried Front Royal Taxi. We learned that Uber is banned in Front Royal for some issues we were not clear about. We paid $20 plus $5 tip to get us back to Tucker Lane (which was 7 miles from Front Royal) where we parked our car. 
I feel good about being able to go back to the AT and hike. I hope and pray I will  be able to do this every weekend.","Access Point at Tucker Lane

My wrist problem has improved but my congestion has gone worse! I thought hiking will help so I asked Rick if he could take a week off from work and accompay me to hike the AT. So he did. 
We reached the trailhead at 10:00 am and after registration or checking in our car for a pay parking at $3 per night at the Mountain Home Cabin, we started our trek south bound to Tom Floyd Wayside Shelter at 10:40 am. It was a rough, uphill trek all because we werre out of practice for a long time! My pack weighs around 25-30 lnbs and pulls down on my back, making my hips feel numb! 
We started at 950 feet and reached the shelter at 1,050 feet elevation after three hours! It's a 3 mile distance so our pace was one of our slowest at 1 mile per hour! 
Because I was so weakand tired, we stopped every now and then. Rick is so patient in waiting for me each time. When we were near the shelter, he hiked faster and came back to carry may pack for me. He's such a helpful, thoughtful, and loving husband! 
There were around six people in the shelter that night. One is a 74 year old lady who had been section hiking for 10 years and she's alone! Another hiker who did not stay with us, was from Holland. She too, is hiking alone!
Water is one important supply we always look into when hiking. The guide book says that there is a source two-tenths of a mile down from the shelter, but when Rick wennt down there he didnt find any.

We plan to take two weeks off and do a section hike either starting at Shenandoah Mountain towards south or drive 8 hours to the end of Georgia section and hike north. I also think that it will help us better if we just take a max of 5 miles a day because we really are not as fit as before.

We arrived Franklin,  NC before 3 PM, we thought it's a good 10-hr drive! and was supposed to stay in Baltimore Jack's Place (7 Derby St.) where we have a reservation for 2 bunk beds, but when we arrived, we were informed the hostel is full.  At $20 per head this is not bad but had to check Budget Inn and Sapphire In for available rooms. We got one from Sapphire at a hikers' rate of  $59 per room plus tax. 
Sapphire Inn is a small hotel but clean and the staff was accommodating.  
Franklin is a small town with a little less than 4,000 population. Their roads were narrow and traffic is quite scary because there are no pedestrian paths, and I feel like cars run so fast!

Grateful ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616881,"It was a difficult decision to go back to the Trail but looked like circumstances had worked together to lead me back to hiking and set my priorities straight.
I thought I would fly back to the Philippines straight from leaving my job to attend to family concerns but as soon as I have informed my employer and was getting ready for my air tickets, my daughter found a friend who could help us settle the main issue that have at first required me to go home! It's too late to go back to my job and my lingering health issues of shortness of breath, overweight, elevated sugar level, wrist, joint and back pains were haunting me to do something! These made it easier to make that desired decision - go back to the Appalachian Trail and achieve my health goals of throwing overweight and health issues away!
So on April 12th, my husband and I drove 10 hours to Georgia to continue where we left off in 2017. We finished 67 miles in two weeks, stopping at NOC (Mile 136.8) and went back home to Maryland. And yesterday, May 4th, after a week off trail, we left again to go back to NOC for me to continue.",,View Entry,"May 05, Sun",0

I still have the idea that the trail from here will be a very difficult one, with 2,978 feet elevation gain over a 6-mile steep slope up straight to the top of Swim Bald! But I did it and as I write about this, I cannot remember how I did it! In total, I finished 6.9 miles in 7 hours today. I arrived ate dinner, hang my food bag, and gone to dream of the next day by 7 PM!

Finished the target miles, didn't mind the terrain but this - a snake was sunbathing and relaxing on the trail! I remember growing up hearing from my old and everyone discussing the subject of snakes that whenever one sees a snake that he/she should kill it! Not me, though. I'm always scared of snakes and besides, I learned they are afraid of us more than we are of them! So today, I just asked the snake to let me pass! Still took me 7 hours to reach my destination but that includes stops to rest, take pictures and enjoy the beauty along the trail! ??Lonni picked me up at the gap and I spent the night at his hostel, The Wolfcreek Hostel where I left most of my stuff so I could semi slack pack.","Sassafras Gap Shelter at Mile 143.8

Unlike two weeks ago when Rick and I constantly see other hikers both north- and south- bound, today it took me 3 hours to see some hikers.I love my breakfast on the trail - hotdog sandwich! It's rare to get real food while hiking so last night I bought a hotdog from the diner next to the hostel where I stayed. My favorite picture of the day is of the butterfly which stayed on the leaf for me to enjoy for a while! Hiking at an average of 1 mile per hour due to very steep and long climbs, I reached the Cable Gap Shelter at 4 PM. No one was there. No phone signal. Prayed for more hikers to come and thanked God, around 8 came and became friends - a couple, a woman called Wrong Way (she was lost force hours I heard, and today lost her direction again!), Chuck Norris, wild Bill and others.","Stecoah Gap at Mile 150.6

We dropped my resupply box last week on our way to Wolfcreek Hostel and I know I will be charged $5 for that. It's free for their guests but I would prefer to pay $5 than the room of $79! I will be staying at the Fontana Dam Shelter where there is shower anyway, and it's free! The 'Hilton', which is another name they call the shelter for it's high level amenities compared to other shelters. Not only did I enjoy the hot shower at the Hilton, they also have a full and clean toilet, charging ports and a very nice, resort-like location surrounded by amazing views of the lake!Another thing I love about Fontana Dam was that I was also able to get my favorite banana muffins from the village's general store!","Cable Gap Shelter at Mile 159.2

When I got out of my tent, I don't see the other 4 or 5 people I saw the night before. They all have gone. I don't know where they went - nobo or sobo I don't have any idea. I got ready, and when I was about to go and tested my water filter with the small dirty water I took from the stream yesterday, my filter did not work. I panicked! I called my husband and asked him if he could bring me water and new water filter. We agreed to meet at the next road which is wolfsville rd which is just 0.2 miles from Ensign Cowall Shelter. It was an easy, short hike. I set up my hammock to relax while waitiing for Rick. A policeman stopped by and asked if IO was ok. I said yes, and that I was waiting for my husband. He left and on his way out to the road, he picked up the thrashed spread on the corner and straighten up the fallen thrash bin. He's a good policeman. At around 11 my husband came. He brouhgt coffee, egg Mcmuffin, cheetos puff, water and water filter. I am so blessed to have a supportive husband! At 12:30 I started my trek up the mountain towards Pogo Memorial Campsite. Again, it was a strenuous hike up, with big and medium sized, sharp rocks that you have no choice but step on them, muddling your footsoles and straining painfully your leg muscles. The 4.8 miles hike was  just enough for the remaining strength I have, for what I have enough for the day. It took me 3.5 hours to complete the 4.8 miles and arrived the camp at 4:00 pm. There was as spring just 200 yards west of the campsite so I refilled my bottles, washed my face and hands with soap and did some body clean up. Not bathing, just used wet wipes and a little of splashing my face with water. I found what I think is the best tent site, set it up and by 5 pm I was ready to settle in. But not after I cooked my dinner of noodles, dired spinach, protein substitute and beef jerky. Then I hung my food. Glad I still remember the technique of tying, throwing up the rope and making sure the bear won't be able to reach it. Past 8 pm, I got out of my tent to see whether there are other hikers that camped nearby. There was none. I was a bit afraid, knowing that I am in the middle of knowhere. The nearest road is 4 miles and it's my first time to sleep alone! No neighbors, no one passing by, just no one! I woke up several times during the night and distracted my fears by praying, then chatting or reading.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Filled out the SNP permit which is required if you are to spend the night anywhere in the park. Since Rick was looking for our hotel, I just included him as a group member in my registration. By the way, there is a fee when you enter the SNP in a car, good Rick has a lifetime card which he got 3 years ago when I started hiking.  It was very cheap atty that time for only $10. Now it's $80! 
I walked slow up the about 1000 feet up to the Bear Den Mountain, passed Mcormick Gap where I found a gallon of water left NY a trail angel. Oh, when hiking,  bring enough water. I brought only 750 ml thinking i don't drink water that much anyway. But i was wrong.  I finished my water after 2 miles! I was very thirsty after tackling the slope and some rocky parts. 
I reached the conmunications Tower then the Bears Den Mountain and with 1.5 miles per hour I reached  Beagle Gap after 3 hours and 20 min. The colors were fading it would have been at peak if we came a week earlier.
Rick booked us at Holiday inn for $100 a night. It was a  very nice hotel and we did not mind paying  what we thought was beyond our budget as we treat this trip as a vacation.

I had a good speed today, about 2.4 miles per hour. And I don't feel lonely or bored nor scared, feelings i had when hiking alone before. I think it's because it feels like Rick is hiking with me although not all throughout, the sense of having him waiting atty the next road crossing or hiking to my direction makes a lot of difference making me feel like I'm not hiking alone!
