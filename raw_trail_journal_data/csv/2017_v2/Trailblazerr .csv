Trailblazerr ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519582,"Well it's getting close , my dream odyssey trip that I have always talked about since the 70's will hopefully come to pass , starting Mid March,2017. I have read many books , followed thru-hiker on YouTube and even hiked different sections of the AT over the last 40 years and soon I will have the time to actually attempt it all 2190 miles of it . I 'm currently hitting the gym and hiking the local trails in preparation. I have always heard the saying,"" to heavy , too fast , too much"" ,where it comes to hiking long distance. Back 40 years ago , my back could take a 50lb + pack , not anymore . The new gear is lighter and your trail experiences give you better insight into what is necessary and what can be used for more than one purpose , that's the key to getting the pack weight down. My base weight (everything but food water and fuel) is 12.5 lbs. Food(4 days) , water and fuel (isopropyl alcohol) will weigh another 12.5 lbs = 25 total pounds for 4 days on the trail . Very manageable and less stress, physically speaking. I haven't decided weather to take the flip-flop approach , to avoid over-crowding campsites. One would peak Katadin in late Aug and greyhound back to Harpers Ferry and head south. Would be in the Smokey in October,or just head Northbound as I had hoped to do many years ago and still would like to do. Exited .

Trailblazerr ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520549,"I have started hiking the local park trails w/ backpack at 90% full. The trail has several hills and am up to 5 miles in 2.5 hrs. Will start doing 10 miles soon and hope to do that in 6hrs. My total pack weight on trail will be around 30lb max. w / food and water. also exercising in the gym with focus on cardio and strength. My goal is to be as prepared as I can be at start and let the rest be up to the trail.See you on the trail.
