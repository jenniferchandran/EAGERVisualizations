Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574510,"Here we are, less than a week away from the trail! I'm devoting the entire week to making last minute adjustments and plans. I put everything into my pack last night and weighed it. My base weight comes out to exactly 20 lbs. This includes everything I'll be carrying except food, water, and the clothes on my back. Which is a lot better than I was expecting, I cut out a lot of the luxury items but there were a few things I couldn't do without. Finishing a long hike is as much a mental task as it is a physical one. So i'm keeping that in mind while I pack and repack. ",,View Entry,"Aug 08, Tue",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574652,"I can barely sleep. My pack is ready, I'm ready, and I finished my prep work for the trail today. Using AWOL's guide I mapped out how far I would like to hike each day and where I should stop if I want to make it back in one month. I also highlighted my resupply points for food, hot showers, and maybe a soft bed if I feel that I need it. I reserved 3 beds at Woodchucks Hostel in Damascus VA, Saturday night for my dad, my brother, and I. We will spend the night after driving 9 hours and dropping my car off at Springer Mountain along the way. Sunday morning we are driving to Grayson Highlands State Park where I will say my goodbyes and start my hike! I've given a lot of thought to my trail name and I've settled on Navigator. Not only is it my unofficial job title for the Air Force, but Papa Chris gifted me a walking stick with a compass in the top  because new LT's do tend to get lost easily. So... Navigator it is. ",,View Entry,"Aug 10, Thu",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574868,"Tonight is my last in my soft bed at home. Tomorrow we head for adventure, onward to Damascus! I've done all the planning and prepping that is possible, from now on I learn everything the hard way. For anyone planning their own long distance hike I want to recommend the YouTube series Darwin on the trail, a thru-hiker himself, Darwin's videos have probably helped me more than anything else while planning this trip. Do yourself a favor and check it out! A dozen hiking books, at least a hundred trail journals, and regularly checking whiteblaze forum gave me everything else I needed. Finished my final gear weigh in tonight. For my pack weight I was shooting for around 30 lbs with food and water. I came in at 29.8! Which begs the question.... What the hell am I forgetting?",,View Entry,"Aug 11, Fri",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574947,"We woke up bright and early this morning and drove all day. We dropped my car off at Amicalola Springs State Park where I will be finishing my hike. The park ranger was very sweet and took all my information down and asked when I'd be back, I told her September 13th which they saved for their records and gives me a self-set goal of hiking 500+ miles in exactly one month. I jumped into the truck with dad and we rode towards Damascus.Driving along I spotted a flashback from the past. Mercier Apple Orchard! I gave dad a heart attack and almost caused a wreck when I shouted, ""STOP!""  as we drove past. (In retrospect not my brightest move) I haven't been there since my rafting adventures down the Ocoee River with my freshman ROTC class back in 2013. A very good memory and an even better meal.When we arrived in Damascus we stopped at Woodchucks Hostel and paid for our beds and then walked through town. The official Appalachian Trail actually goes right through their Main Street and white blazes are painted on power lines along the way. So you could say I hiked a bit of the trail today. After our walk around town I decided my dad and I deserved a beer and luckily Damascus has their very own brewery, they happened to have a bluegrass band playing tonight. What better way to celebrate the start of an adventure than good beer and music? A good start to a great adventure and I'm glad to have spent the time with both my brother and dad.",,View Entry,"Aug 12, Sat",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575135,"I threw up blueberry waffles. A mixture of beer & greasy pizza from last night mixed with nerves and the never ending curves and twists of mountain roads led to an unpleasant start. Once arrived at the park Andrew and Dad walked with me to the start of the AT. We said our goodbyes, and I headed off on my journey thinking I had a nice easy day walking through the Highlands and maybe even running into some wild ponies. I was only half right.About .5 miles in I walked into a pasture with a large group of ponies grazing. They were very sweet and let me pet them and even take a selfie or two. As more day hikers came through I continued on. The Grayson Highlands look exactly like the Sound of Music scene where she sings the title song on a hill, it's absolutely beautiful. I took a lunch about 8 miles in and ran into Glassman who has hiked all of Virginia and is about to finish, I walked the rest of the way to Lost Mtn with him as a partner. By the time I arrived after pulling 16 miles on the first day, my whole body was fatigued, blister were starting to form, and I had no appetite. At the shelter we ran into tree hugger & claw hammer, a Canadian couple who carried a banjo, mandolin, and an extra mini guitar just in case they ran into someone who can play! What luck! We 3 jammed the night away as Thor and his dachshund watched and Glassman played a mean harmonica solo. It was challenging, rough at parts, and I asked myself what the hell I was thinking at least a hundred times but today was exactly the kind of experience I was hoping for, interesting people and great memories. -Navigator","Massie Gap

Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575141,"Today was a reality check. I've read about people coming out here and doing 20 mile days, everyday, like its no problem. Well the most dangerous part of the AT is your mind, I thought I would do another 15 miles to get back to Damascus. That didn't happen. I woke up, ate breakfast , made coffee and then waited so I could say goodbye to my new musical Canadian friends, eh. Left the shelter with that new day energy and got a mile down the trail in record time before I realized..  I left my walking stick back at the shelter. I just turned a daunting 15 mile day into 17. It was rough going after that, the blisters on my feet were causing havoc, I bruised my left ankle on a rock, and my legs were fatiguing rather quickly. I started to realize that my ambitious plans may need a little toning down or my hike would turn into a dreaded chore instead of the fun adventure I had in mind. I've stopped at Saunders Shelter, taken care of my feet, and strung up my hammock. I'm going to rest and fill my body with some well needed calories. I haven't been feeling hungry even though I know I need the energy. I'm forcing myself to eat. When I left I weighed in at 164 lbs, I really can't afford to lose a lot of weight so I'm about to make some delicious pepperoni and cheese burritos, then it's tuna & rice for dinner again. -Navigator","Lost Mountain Shelter

Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575228,"Left from Saunders Shelter headed for Damascus. Rained last night so I had some wet gear to put away. Hoping to arrive in town around noon so I could call home, dry my gear, and take care of some personal business. Started to rain pretty hard about 3 miles from town, put on my rain gear and kept on. About 2 miles from town there was a downhill section where I picked up some speed, wanting to get to town and out of the rain I was pushing it. Well... I landed on my right ankle (the same one that I sprained back in February) and landed hard on the ground. I could tell I'd sprained it pretty bad having dealt with this not long ago. Limped into town, got a bunk, and now I'm icing the ankle. I'm honestly not sure if I'm going to be able to hike on it right now. So in the morning I'll make the decision. Not feeling great about this.","Saunders Shelter

Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575791,"So quick update. I decided it was best not to continue the hike, I was getting pretty beat up and that last fall I took had my ankle swollen pretty bad. I decided to be cautious and head back home to rest and continue my hike another time. Picked up my car from Amicalola Springs (pictured) and now I'm back home trying not to think about the trail too much. I'm not happy about ending my journey so quick but it's the smart thing to do for now. On the bright side, I had a good time and when I go back to the trail I'll have experience and a better mindset to tackle the challenges of the trail. Also, better ankle support...-Navigator",,View Entry,"Aug 21, Mon",0
