RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546202,"Next year will hopefully be my third attempt to complete the AT after two disastrous beginnings. I've been following the entries of several hikers this year, And I can't wait to begin again. Early April sounds appealing but haven't picked the exact date yet when I intend to start. I'll spend this year doing more gear research.","

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560825,"Left home this morning at 6 am, flew to Atlanta and arrived at Hiker Hostel about 8 this evening. I was picked up along with 8 other hikers and shuttled to Dahlonega, Georgia. Terrible traffic! 1 1/2 hour ride to get here and am enjoying the fully bloomed azaleas and rhododendrons. Interesting people - one hiker is out to break a speed record, another is celebrating a 40th birthday. Had intended to come back around here on Saturday night but there's no room at the inn.",,"Dahlonega, GA ","Apr 19, Wed",0
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561015,Started out at mile 2.8 this morning and arrived at Hawk Mountain (mile 7.4) about 11 this morning. My goal tonight is either Justus Creek (mile 14) or Gooch Mountain (mile 15.8). There's a 3300' climb at Sassafras Mountain between here and there so I don't know how tired I'll be. Had my first calamity - my sleeping pad blew a hole near the valve so my patch kit probably won't work. They sell them at Neel's Gap so just two more nights on the ground. Could have been much worse like the guy who left his cell phone at the hostel and realized it after a 45 minute shuttle ride. This morning I left at the same time as the woman who hopes to break the speed record for completing the AT. Her goal is about 50 miles per day. When I said good-bye I told her I'd probably never see her again.,"Stover Creek Shelter

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561195,"Tough day today - very hot and humid. Hit a wall from the heat and not being able to eat much. Met a very nice group of Cub Scouts who invited me to join them. They fed me lunch and then invited me tonight for dinner. Steak on the grill! As we don't eat much beef at home, this is really a treat! Terrain is very tough here and I'm going to sleep on the couch at High Valley Resort. I'll even be able to take a shower. No towels, but that's okay. Weather is supposed to get crazy tonight - thunderstorms with possible hail. Haven't been sleeping well on the ground since my sleeping pad got a hole. I'll be in Neels Gap day after tomorrow where I can resupply with a new pad. Think I'm also going to buy shorts and sun screen. Just too hot for long pants!","Hawk Mountain

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561386,"Non stop pouring rain, knees that are really hurting, soaked equipment and clothes, and no sleep have pushed me to my limit. I've decided to leave the trail and head home. Met a very nice person who's going to drive me to Charlotte, North Carolina tomorrow. I'll catch the train from there very early Tuesday morning and hopefully be home late Tuesday night.","Neels Gap
