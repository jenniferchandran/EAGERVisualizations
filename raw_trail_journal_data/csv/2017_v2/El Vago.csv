Because, you see, gentlemen, these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. … Carpe, carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.” -- John Keating (aka Robin Williams) in Dead Poets SocietyMy life has been extraordinary. It's been graced 35 years by the love and support of my wife Diane. It's been blessed by three children, Lauren, Matt, and Dan, now adults and fellow travelers wending their own ways in the world. And my early retirement seemed to be the capstone. Every day is Saturday, who can complain about that? Apparently, I could. While it may seem idyllic, leisurely sipping a morning cup of coffee with no need to rush off to work, it wants for adventure. I’m not ready to run out the clock; I’ve a bucket list to work on. At 58, I still yearn to make my life extraordinary.   For as long as I can remember – and that’s not long these days – I have wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. This ambition has held a prominent place on the bucket list, next to taking a road trip across the U.S. Last summer, after Diane warmed to the thought of my going on a five to six month jaunt along the Eastern Seaboard, knowing she would have to run the household, care for the dog, and send me vittles along the way, I started preparations. I read several books about the trail, watched countless You Tube videos, and accumulated gear. The Appalachian Trail, or AT, winds its way across fourteen states with terminuses at Springer Mt. GA and Mt. Katahdin, ME. The mileage currently approaches 2,190 miles. The total distance changes from time to time. In 2010, it was only 2,179.1 miles from end to end. Oh, for the good old days. Someone estimated that it’s 5 million steps, the equivalent of 83 marathons. Fortunately, I don’t have to walk them all at once, just one step at a time.",,Temporary Leave of My Wits,"Feb 18, Sat",0
El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555002,"“What's in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet” -- Billy S.Though sweet will not aptly describe how I will smell on the trail, I will be called by a name other than my given one. Trail names are part of the AT experience. Hikers generally do not refer to each other by their given names.   Rather, for the short(?) while they are on the trail, and even afterwards, they answer to an alias. It reminds of the CB radio days, when truckers had their own handles.   Either you give yourself a trail name or your fellow hikers will give you one, sometimes based on how you look or on some stupid act on your part. I prefer to give myself my own trail name and beat my trail companions to the punch.After wrestling with various names the likes of Don Quixote (the absent-minded wanderer), and Scarecrow (if I only had a brain), I decided to go with El Vago. It’s pronounced “el bah-go”, the “v” sounding like a “b”. I took the name from the Spanish idiom “el vago siempre trabaja doble,” which translates loosely to “the lazy man always works twice as hard.” As an illustrative example of the El Vago principle, consider returning from the grocers with one bag too many to carry from the garage to the kitchen in a single trip. A wise man takes two trips. But not El Vago! Determined to avoid that second visit to the car, El Vago awkwardly scoops up all bags in his arms, establishing a firm grip on none of them. Invariably, one or more bags slip his grasp and fall. If he’s lucky, the damage is minimal. Typically, though, the contents spill, eggs break, apples roll under the car, or the cap pops open on the milk jug. El Vago has managed to create more work for himself. It’s a phrase our family uses frequently whenever we catch someone doing a bonehead move. “You’re doing an El Vago” is a common refrain in our household, usually directed at me. I fully expect the trail will give me ample opportunity to live up to it.",,Call me Ishmael,"Feb 22, Wed",0
El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555266,"In two days, I will be on a midnight plane to Georgia, Atlanta specifically. I've booked a shuttle ride to the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega, where I have a bunk reserved for me. I pity my prospective roommates, for rumor has it I can make the walls rattle with staccato bursts of thunderous snorts. The next morning I will start the hike from Amicalola Falls, taking the approach trail to Springer Mt., where the AT officially starts for north bounders. To ascend the Falls the approach trail has 604 steps. That's over 30 flights of stairs. The difficulty level is considered strenuous. And I'll be carrying 35 pounds on my back. (I'm thinking it's not too late to book a return flight.) I expect it to take me the full day to reach Springer, a distance of almost 9 miles. What's a measly 9 miles when you're hoping to walk 2200? Besides, the Falls are the tallest in Georgia. Wouldn't want to miss that, especially since I'll be in the neighborhood!",,Georgia on My Mind,"Feb 27, Mon",0
El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555403,"A travel day today. After an early morning flight from Logan -- thanks Diane for the 4:30 a.m. ride to the airport, I know how much you love early mornings -- a train ride on MARTA to North Springs Station, and a shuttle ride to Dahlonega, I am now chilling out in the Hiker Hostel living room. It's pouring buckets and thundering. Sure am glad I am not walking the trail at the moment. When weather like this pops up, the phone at the hostel starts ringing incessantly, hikers caught in the storm looking for a ride back to a warm, dry, well lighted place. Well, my turn will come tomorrow. The forecast is for sunnier climes. Met three young hikers in the shuttle. Their combined ages barely exceeded my own. Though we are all starting from Amicalola Falls tomorrow morn, chances are the last I will see of them will be the backs of their packs as they speed off into the distance. All are looking for fellow hikers to give them trail names. I hope our fellow hikers will be kind.",,"Planes, trains, and automobiles","Mar 01, Wed",0
El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555507,"A seasoned AT hiker who shared my room at the Hiker Hostel tried his hardest to persuade me not to take the approach trail, which brings you from Amicalola Falls to the top of Springer Mountain. It is a grueling way to start the journey, he said. You'll kill yourself before the hike even officially starts; it's very steep. But I had my heart set on it. I'm glad I did not listen to him. He was right, the trail was grueling and steep, but the Falls were magnificent. And completing the climb boosted my confidence. Scotty, a humorous man from the UK, about to celebrate his 50th birthday next month on the trail, and Cody, a youngster of 23 from Indiana, accompanied me. Both felt the extra effort was worth it.Setting up camp in the cold was a new and fumbling experience, as was hanging my food bag on a cable to keep it out of reach of bears. Cooking dinner on a small stove was also novel and awkward. And sleep did not come easy. A screech owl cried out in the middle of the night. It's screeching went on for about twenty minutes. It was eerie. What else lurked out there in the darkness? So far, so good. Sore, but having a blast.","Amicalola Falls

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555541,"The body put up mild resistance this a.m., but after a hot bowl of oatmeal with dried cranberries and walnuts, I was fueled and ready. My camping skills are rusty, very rusty, and it seemed like ages for me to break down camp and repack the rucksack. I was last one out of the shelter. Scotty graciously waited for me and we hiked the distance to Hawk Shelter together. A bit chilly when the wind blew, but the weather was clear and sunny, and the terrain only mildly strenuous. The trail is rapidly filling with hikers. Another 40 plus came out today. Over 100 are expected to join this weekend. We will be racing each other for spots at the shelters. The chatter around the fireplace tonight is boisterous. I'm being anti-social, tucked into my sleeping bag, warm, comfortable, and quite exhausted. I find myself going into the tent before dark because it takes me so long to slip into my camp pjs and arrange my pack's contents within the tent. I have to take care not to have any packets of food, even empty wrappers, lest I attract the pesky and destructive mouse. Looking forward to see what tomorrow will bring.","Springer Mountain Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555777,"Great hiking weather, not too chilly, not too warm, nothing but blue skies. Georgia is surprisingly mountainous. The trees are still bare and cast long shadows in the woods. The only color is the green from the occasional pine, abundant rhododendron, and holly. Hiked most of the day with Scotty and caught up later to Cody. Shortly after Cody fell to one knee and badly bruised it. His hobbling earned him the trail name Wounded Knee. Coincidently, the youngster has spent time at Wounded Knee and is a font of information regarding Native Americans. The trail name appears to be sticking.I saw my first wildlife - a grey squirrel. Could have seen one of these from the comfort of my living room recliner, but then I would have had to listen to Archer bark madly at it.Still getting used to making and breaking camp. I'm getting the reputation for being rather pokey at this. It's just that there are so many loose odds and ends that go in this bag or that one that I haven't quite established an efficient system.

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555778,"The first comfortable night for sleeping - I did not see my breath within the tent - and yet sleep eluded me. Even the slightest slope causes the sleeping bag and it's restless contents to slide to the lowest point. I got about six hours of sleep in 20 minute segments, despite being in the tent for almost 11 hours. Hiker midnight comes early for these weary bones.Today's hike was the best thus far. Could not have asked for better weather. I hiked in a shirt sleeve, a rather gamey one, the full day. Again I set off with Scotty, and within the first few miles we experienced out first trail magic. A young man who had thru hiked in 2015, trail name McGiver, presently living in Atlanta, stood behind a table having the most delicious food. He fed us breakfast of scrambled eggs, cheese, sausage, English muffins, and pastries. I sampled every item and returned for seconds on the eggs. I even had my first Coca Cola before noon. Must be developing an appetite. At Woody Gap we caught up with Wounded Knee and Wind Walker, we're joined by Fireweed, and had lunch at a picnic table, the five of us. The laughter around the table was contagious, much of it at the expense of a supposed thru hiker who has been begging food from every one he meets. The trail name we've given him is Sponge Bob. It was one of those memorable moments.The view from atop Big Cedar Mtn was another highlight. We spent 15 to 20 minutes taking every permutation of photo, with the outstanding view of the mountains as the backdrop. If only every day was like today!","Gooch Gap Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555779,"Rain fell for the first time on my thru hike. Packing a wet tent is low on the list of pleasant activities. Again, I dawdle while breaking camp. I did not want to set out without my bowl of instant oatmeal and cup of Folger coffee. Wounded Knee, Wind Walker, and Scotty eventually went off, while I finished my fine dining.Hiking solo is a spiritual experience. I find myself communing with nature and talking aloud to God, not worried I'm going to be overheard and considered off my rocker. The ascent of Blood Mtn was the big task of the day. It stands at 4457 feet. It stood between me a Neel Gap, where a reserved cabin awaited. I was to share the cabin with Scotty, Wounded Knee, and Wind Walker. The hiking conditions were fickle. When the ridge passed along the East side of ascent, the wind blew cold and I had to don my wool hat and gloves. But when the trail moved to the West and the wind did not reach me, I needed to remove them. The climb entered a thick, chilly fog. When I reached the shelter at the peak, visibility was poor. Too bad, because the view from Blood Mountain is apparently outstanding. Guess I'll have to catch this view next time.I somehow managed to catch up to the troupe on the descent. We entered Neel Gap together, hiked the .3 mi to our cabin, washed 4 plus days of grime off ourselves, had our laundry done, and fed our faces until we could eat no more. Then we took a .3 mi hike back to the outfitters at the top of the hill, where I paid a king's ransom for an inflatable sleeping pad. The foam pad I was using wasn't working for me. I felt every pebble under my sleeping bag. Looking forward to a good night's sleep tonight in a comfy bed and on a comfy pad here on out. Fortunately, Fireweed was at Neel Gap with her puck up truck and shuttled us back to the cabin.Btw: rain coming tomorrow. Uggh.","Lance Creek Campsite

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555816,"The trail passes through the doorway of the Neel Gap outfitters. The day started drizzily and got progressively worse. Most of the morning hike cut through a dense fog, where I could not see more than 20 yards ahead of me. Trees became tall ghostly sentinels lining the path. Silouettes of birds, flushed by my presence, darted about in the woods. A cold wet wind caused me to pull my hood tight about my face. My view of the world had become myopic. I saw only the path at my feet. I could also hear nothing except the rush of the wind and my panting. If someone had come up from behind and touched me, I would have jumped out of my skin.Scotty, Wounded Knee, and I reached the shelter about 4 p.m., with the rain falling steadily. Thoroughly exhausted, I now had before me the novel chore of setting up my tent in the rain. It was another fumbling affair, but somehow I managed to limit the amount of water that fell into the tent. I was not as successful keeping out the mud. I realize now that I must get used to living in squalor. Presently it's 6 p.m., I am cozy and warm in my bag, and it's still coming down hard out there. But I still have to hang my bear bag. Maybe I'll just use it as a pillow tonight. What bear in it's right mind would go out foraging on a night like this?","Neel Gap

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555913,"Mercifully, today brought sunshine and no rain. Not sure how well I would have coped with two soaking days in a row at this stage of my hike. As it was, last night's rain induced me to make two bonehead mistakes.The first was going to bed without dinner. I simply did not want to leave the protection of my tent to stand in a cold rain while my pasta cooked, especially since I had gone through great pains to warm up. Besides, I wasn't hungry. I figured I would double down on the instant oatmeal in the morning. However the extra servings of oatmeal did not give me enough energy. After two miles I bonked, my legs felt like lead. I plied myself with gorp and energy bars, but I never felt myself for the rest of the hike.The second brilliant maneuver was to put the foot of my sleeping bag into a trash bag, thinking it would keep it dry. My concern was that the foot of the bag might touch the end of the tent and wick in some of the rain. My preventive action had the opposite effect. The sleeping bag is designed to breathe, but the trash bag held in all the moisture. This morning the foot of the sleeping bag was soaking wet. But mercifully it was a sunny day, and I was able to dry it in the sun.Tomorrow Scotty, Wounded Knee, Wind Walker, and I are going to hitch to the town of Helen. We're hitchhiking in pairs. None of us are familiar with the practice. Admittedly, the idea has me a tad anxious. It's hard to imagine anyone stopping for an old homeless looking man.It's all part of the adventure!","Low Gap Shelter

At Unicoi Gap, Wounded Knee found at a trail kiosk a business card for John's shuttle. We quickly abandoned the uncertainty of hitchhiking in favor of the more sure shuttle service. He arrived in a mere matter of minutes. We were in the town of Helen within half an hour.We checked in at the Helendorf Hotel, which offers special hiker rates. The friendly gal behind the counter also extended the hours of continental breakfast and invited us to help ourselves to the buffet. Our worn faces and emaciated frames must have elicited her charity.Helen is a beautiful town with one main street running through the center and crossing over a clear fast moving stream. It's shops, restaurants, hotels follow an Alpine motif (German, Swiss?), with red tile roofs and pointed eaves. Many of the shops have flowerbeds at the storefront, signs that Spring has already come here in the South. Tonight I am sharing a hotel room with Scotty, who has rummaged through his pack in search of earplugs. I,too, will be using earplugs so I don't wake myself up.Tomorrow we will back on the trail. Betty's Grocery Shop runs a free shuttle back to Unicoi Gap. It leaves at 10:30 a.m. Can't beat that price; we'll be there.","Blue Mountain Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556061,"After consuming about 8000 calories of steak, baked potato with sour cream, butter and bacon bits, potato chips, homefries, eggs, bananas, bagels with cream cheese, coffee, juice, and Gatorade, I was adequately fueled to face today's two four thousand footers. Our gang of four got a free shuttle ride to Unicoi Gap. In the parking lot a church group had stoked up a barbeque, but we were full from our second breakfast and anxious to be on our way. So we started our ascent of Rocky Mountain, Wind Walker in the lead, followed by Scotty, Wounded Knee, and myself at the rear. Some might say I'm in this last position because I am the slowest, but truth be told I walk at the end in order to collect all the items dropped by my compatriots walking ahead of me. It's that important a role.We plodded up Rocky Mountain, down the other side, up Tray Mountain, and down the other side to the shelter. Our mileage for the day was light, but the hike was strenuous. I'll be taking some vitamin I before bed tonight.The best adventure of the day was our free shuttle to Unicoi. The four of us expected a van to pick us up in front of Betty's Country Store. Instead we were surprised to find a Dodge pickup truck was our means of transportation. The driver apologized, saying he had no room in the cab, and asked if we minded sitting in the flatbed. Our course we didn't mind, right? Scotty and Wounded Knee jumped in first with their loaded packs and found choice seats behind the cab. In next went Wind Walker. I jumped in last and noticed immediately my limited options for settling my carcass. At my left side was a hairy, moist, huge cat turd. In front of me was a sizable puddle of water, I hope. And to my right was the tailgate which closed with a faint weak click. Wind Walker, sitting directly across from me, held the door closed with his left hand and warned me not to lean on it. He did not have to tell me twice. Once we settled down, the driver sped off, and I sat there wondering how is this legal and hoping that I would not die.The drive to Unicoi is windy, with many a hairpin turn. Each time the truck banked right the puddle flowed closer to my buttocks. I sacrificed my bandana to save my pants. Also, a truck moving at 35 mph creates quite a windchill for those who cannot hunker behind the cab. The tip of my nose was frostbitten, or so it seemed. It was the longest 9 miles of my life. No such thing as a free shuttle ride.","Unicoi Gap

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556146,"Last night at the Tray Mt. Shelter was our coldest yet. Temperatures in the 20s and a steady wind made it uncomfortable outside the tent and barely tolerable within. Sleeping came fitfully. We broke camp with the break of morning. We ate breakfast on the move, a snickers bar, fig bar, and gorp, because we had a long Hike ahead of us. I wore four top layers at the start and never wore less than three. It was cold all day.Today's main challenge was Kelly Knob, another 4 thousand footer. It was a mile of steep inclines to reach the top. No switchbacks. I climbed at a snail's pace. I've come to appreciate that Georgia can be hard.Descending has it's own set of challenges. Knees and heels and toes get quite sore, and you must carefully watch your every step. After a brief eternity, we arrived at the parking lot of Dicks Creek Gap, where we found, to our delight, trail magic. Members of the Baptist Church cooked us hamburgers and hotdogs, and a father-son team made an outstanding stew. The son thru-hiked in 2016, and remembers Santa and Northstar well. His trail name is Goose.Getting to Hiawassee presented another challenge. We were 9 miles from town, and our shuttle arrangement had fallen through. Just as we were scratching our heads and getting used to the thought that we would need to hitch hike, an enormous extended van pulled into the parking lot. Emboldened by the cold and the prospect of standing on the side of the road for who knows how long, I walked to driver side window and waited for it to roll down. ""Do you give shuttle rides to Hiawassee,"" I asked. ""I suppose I can,"" the woman driver replied. ""Isn't that why you're here,"" I asked. ""No, I just came into the lot to turn around,"" she said. ""But this always happens when I pull into a lot, the zombies come to the van. How many are you?"" ""Five""""OK. Pile in.""Two more zombies appeared, and all seven of us piled in, packs and all, that's how big the van was. I was the last one in, and the only remaining seat was the floor of the front passenger seat - there was no seat. I could not see above the dashboard. Another denizen of the van was a small French Bulldog that took a liking to me. He was a crazy licker. It crawled onto my lap and gave my forehead a thorough cleaning. We bid adieu at the Holiday Inn, where we plan to wash up and recharge our batteries. Tomorrow will be a zero day. Good timing, too, because snow is in the forecast for Sunday.

This morning a dusting of snow covered the treetops and the hoods of automobiles in the hotel parking lot. We (Scotty, Wounded Knee, Wind Walker, and I) timed our day off from hiking - referred to in AT vernacular as a zero - just right. No camping in the snow for us last night. A warm and comfortable bed at the Holiday Inn Express gave me the best night of sleep since the hike began. I'm certain being utterly wiped out also had something to do with it.Though we had a few chores to do, such as laundry and grocery shopping, the day was spent stuffing our faces and relaxing. We availed ourselves of the heated pool and hot tub on multiple occasions. Since I did not think to pack a bathing suit, I had to discretely slip into the water in my scivvies -- clean ones, I assure you.We're back on the trail tomorrow, scheduling a shuttle to pick us at 9:30 a.m. and bring us back to Dicks Creek Gap.

No sooner did we cross the border than we ran into a steep rise, with no switchbacks to ease the pain. Only one mile across the border and I was longing for the good old days of Georgia. Our group is down to three. Wind Walker was called home to Austin, Texas, to deal with family matters. He seemed resigned to having to leave the trail so early, keeping his emotions bottled up, but I can't help believe he was terribly disappointed. He sent us a farewell text, saying goodbye y'all, and nice hiking with y'all. Apparently he types with an accent.My wildlife count is up to 3 gray squirrels. At Muskrat Creek Shelter I was bragging about my squirrel sightings to a group of diners - we all cook and eat under cover of the shelter building- when the man sitting across from me at the picnic table described how he saw wild pigs cross the path in front of him and disappear down the side of the mountain. He lost count, guessing there were as many as 25 in the herd (or is it a pack, gaggle, flock, or pride of pigs). I was stunned; no one likes a braggart.","Dicks Creek Gap

He was getting off the trail and heading for Franklin. The cold temperatures were getting to him. Then again, he was hiking in shorts and had no gloves, having accidentally left them behind at Holiday Inn. He said he'd meet us in town.The cold temperatures are also getting to Scotty and me. Temperatures at Carter were in the teens, and the wind was blowing steady. Everything is more difficult to do when your fingers are painfully frozen. It's all but impossible to tie and untie knots. Water filters freeze. Gas stoves ignite with difficulty and don't burn efficiently. And sitting on a ice cold seat in the privy - words can't adequately describe.

But I awoke with a new resolve; I would get to Franklin today, no matter what. I could not imagine spending another evening of winter camping. Scotty echoed these sentiments. He slept not a wink, and much of his clothing and sleeping bag were soaked from condensation within his tent. We got off the trail at the first road we came to, expecting to call a shuttle to drive us to town. Unbeknownst to us, the road was closed for the season. A shuttle could not reach us. So we decided to walk to where a shuttle could. We walked and we walked. Eight plus miles we walked. We eventually reached a parking lot where several cars sit. Scotty pounced on the first person he saw in the lot and managed to persuade him to give us a ride into Franklin. The trail angel's name is Woody. He would not accept payment. That's how folks are here, giving and kind.We're staying at the Microtel hotel, where, to our surprise and delight, we found Wounded Knee.

Pampered by a comfy bed with comfy pillows, three square meals cooked by someone other than me, and a toilet that has no cold air blowing from below and that actually flushes, my will to return to the snow covered hills weakens by the hour. But then I hear that still small voice which says, ""You better not come home for at least a month after all that money you spent."" And so I must trudge on; it's only been two weeks.Franklin is a gorgeous town. It is surrounded by mountains. The population is about 3800, so I'm told, half of which provides shuttle services for AT hikers, or so I believe. We (Wounded Knee, Scotty, and I) rode around town in Macon County Transit vans, for a dollar each, visiting outfitters and the post office. Not exactly riveting stuff, but we did get to see much of the town without having to walk. It didn't take long, though I vowed to myself that I would not submit until at least mile 750, but this morning I ate at McDonald's. No regrets. Their coffee is excellent.We also used our zero day to dry out our tents in the hotel bathroom. So much crud fell off the tents into the tub that it no longer drains.

Since we got off the trail at Mooney Gap, AT hiking convention has it that we resume from Mooney Gap. The eight miles, I figured, would take the morning to complete, leaving just enough energy to climb Albert Mt. (5250') and reach the next shelter. So we'd be walking almost 12 miles, with only the last four counting towards the AT. It was difficult getting excited about today's prospects. We hired a shuttle to bring us to the barricade from where we would start our Bataan march. Our driver was 45 minutes late. On the ride to our drop off point, he had difficulty staying in his lane, yawning profusely, fussing with a coffee mug on the dashboard, and taking calls on his cell. As we neared the drop off point, I noticed a white US Forest Service truck parked in a turnout on the side of the road, with someone in the driver's seat. ""Let's ask him to open the barricade,"" I suggested, not expecting to be taken seriously. To my surprise, our driver did just that, saying something to the effect of hoping to show us a little trail magic. He shortly returned, ""Good news, they are going to open the road today. If it's not open by now, it will be open soon.""We checked, it was not yet open, so we returned to Franklin to kill time over a Kountry Kitchen breakfast. Afterwards, our shuttle driver brought us back to the drop off point, and lo the gate was open. I heard the chorus of angels singing ""Hallelujah!"" Our driver was able to bring us right to Mooney Gap, saving us eight miles of misery, allowing us to reserve our energy for Albert Mt., and enabling us to hike an additional three miles to the next shelter on fresh legs.

The fog cleared in time for us to see the punishing inclines to the tops of both Siler Bald and Wayah Bald Mts. Bald means the peak is mostly rock, and often there's an impressive panoramic view from there. Don't ask me how a Bald differs from a Knob or from just your generic mountain.At the top of Wayah Bald is a stone firetower. The upper part of the tower was made of wood, but it burned during the forest fires of 2016, leaving only a single story of stone. The trees, earth, and bushes on the surrounding slopes are charred, and the smell of a recently dowsed campfire fills the air. Last Autumn this part of the trail was still closed to the public because the fires were still burning. The devastation is widespread; you see it everywhere you turn.We also bade farewell to Wounded Knee at the tower. He had received word that his grandfather was on life support and was making every effort to get back to Florida to be by his side. It was a somber moment. We will miss his company on the trail.

Fortunately, the peak of Wesser Bald was high enough to give me two bars on my phone, just enough to get through. It made my day to hear her voice, probably more than it made hers. One of the downsides of being on the trail is that some important life events happen, and you miss out on them.One of the upsides, however, is the fantastic views with which the trail rewards you after you've huffed it one or two miles to the top of a Bald, or a Knob, or a generic mountain. Wesser Bald had a firetower at its peak, which, with wobbly knees I forced myself to climb, and from which I could see in all directions miles of forest covered foothills and mountains, many with fire-blackened slopes.

It sits on a steep hill that requires technical skills to scale. It's easily 0.2 miles from the center of activity, meaning the laundromat, restaurant, and outfitters. Doesn't sound like much, but I've climbed that confounded hill three times, twice in crocs. Also the shower and bathroom are in a separate building, a considerable distance away, at least 36 steps downhill. I hope and pray I won't need the bathroom tonight, but my track record is not good.

The next shelter was another 9 miles away, and we didn't have the legs to reach it, especially since the climb of Swim occurred at a crawl of about 1.5 mph. So we (Scotty and I) spent a leisurely afternoon at the shelter with Einstein, his brother Little Cheese, Pogo, and a husband-wife team of southbounders in their late 60s. Einstein hales from Denver and Little Cheese from DC. You can tell these guys are bros by the way they verbally abuse each other, all in jest of course.

My bravado however wilted with each blinding flash. Its brightness pierced even closed eyelids. The crack and roll and echo of the thunder was deafening, vibrating the thin walls of my tent, even my teeth, and yet not threatening. I convinced myself that the monstrous sound was harmless. It was on those occasions when the flash of light and sound came together that I winced in my bag and whispered a prayer of thanks. I could not fall asleep until the end of the light show. All the while a heavy rain fell. Rain. There's nothing like camping in the rain. The rain had stopped when Scotty and I broke camp. The storm had brought cold air with it.

My first fall, which took place several days ago, was entirely unremarkable. It was a minor slip in the mud affair. Both feet slipped from under me, and I fell to my hands and knees. Aside from muddied pants and hands, I brushed off the event. It was no big deal. Really.My second fall was a more dramatic affair and happened because of a momentary lack of focus. I was making heady progress towards Fontana Dam, moving downhill at a good clip, when I thought to check the time. My cellphone, which is my timepiece,is in my front right pants pocket. To free my right hand to get at it, I went to transfer my hiking pole in my right hand to the left, while still walking. Instead of a smooth, seamless transfer, the pole bit into the earth just in front of my left leg. The pole stopped the leg mid-stride, and I was airborne. Luckily, my landing was a relatively soft bed of dead leaves and a few small stones. While I was lying on the ground, eye level with the turf, my backpack tried to climb over my head because of its momentum, and my hiking pole launched a half-dozen feet. My first impulse was to look around to see if anyone noticed. No witnesses -- good. Then I did a quick body scan. No pain -- that's good, too. I got off easy, this time.

If all goes according to plan we'll be through the national park, a 70-mile trek,in 5-6 days.

The grounds include tennis courts, volleyball, horseshoes, multiple swimming pools, baseball field, and a children's playground. Most of the resort is closed at this time, it being too early in the season. It strikes me as a fun place to bring a family for a summer vacation. The Lodge treats thru-hikers well, giving us reduced rates, having on-site resupply store and an all-important laundromat. I have come to appreciate such simple pleasures.

I prepped for it with the ""Hungry Hiker"" special at the Lodge's restaurant. The usual breakfast fare, but lots of it. The first 8 miles of the hike went well enough. The trail took us over the top of Fontana Dam. The water level was about 25 feet below the high watermark. Couldn't tell you if it's the result of water control or drought. Another highlight was the Shuckstack firetower. It provided an unequaled panoramic view of the region, but I was not comfortable climbing it. The stairs were rickety, a couple of side railings were missing, and the viewing platform was made of warped, moldy, and thin plywood, some of which was torn up. I did not trust it could support my weight, so I walked on the perimeter where I figured beams would be located underneath. Frankly, the tower should be closed to the public. It's a four-story high accident waiting to happen.Beyond this point, the hike gradually took a difficult turn. I had just eaten a peanut butter fajita that just didn't sit right. Then I became insatiably thirsty. I drank the last of my wster. My feet were like lead. I moved like a tortoise. My stomach ached, which I attributed to a tight waist strap of the backpack. The few miles left to reach the shelter seemed interminable. Another hiker named Tumbleweed saw me struggling and gave me his extra water. I made it to the Shelter exhausted and was greeted immediately by a ridge runner. His first words to me were ""There's a stomach bug going around.""The wind on the ridge was blowing strong, and I had difficulty setting up my tent, my energy was so depleted. Scotty gave me an assist. I crawled inside and laid down, hoping to recover strength. I was drained. Scotty came by after a few minutes and gave me some water, suggesting I eat. I had no appetite, but I forced myself, and the smell of the food nauseated me. All I wanted to do was sleep, though it was scarcely 7 p.m. I dragged myself out of the tent to hang my bear bag and filter water, and crawled back to the tent for the night.

In my short time on the trail I've learned that camping anywhere with the word ridge in its name is going to be windy. As I lay in my bag I could not decide whether to take the day off from hiking or push on to the next shelter as planned. As though in answer to my question, I got an urge of a different type suggesting I get out of my tent, quickly.They say you haven't walked the Appalachian Trail until you've shat your pants. Well, today I've walked the trail. I also knew definitively that I had the stomach bug. I saught advice from the ridge runner who said most people who get the bug leave the trail until they recover. He suggested I return to Fontana. I wanted nothing of that, Fontana being 12 miles in the wrong direction, and a hellacious climb when coming back. So he then proposed I go up to the next shelter and take a series of side trails down to the Cades Cove campground. I was concerned about phone reception there, but he assured me personnel at the ranger station could call a shuttle for me.The path to Russell Field Shelter was an easy hike, thank God, because my stomach felt like the day after doing 500 situps. The side trail supposedly branched off from the shelter, but I had difficulty finding it. At that moment a hiker came out of the shelter and started an idle chitchat. He had just come up from Cades Cove using the side trail, and he showed me where it was. Thank God for little favors.The side trails to the campground were easy hiking, predominantly downhill. My trouble was the frequent urge to race behind a tree. How fortuitous it was that I had just borrowed a whole roll of toilet paper from the Lodge. Not going to lie, but after several hours of this I started thinking about how nice it would be to be back in Massachusetts. The trail crisscrossed a large stream numerous times. Under different circumstances, I might have found the trail to be downright beautiful. But my every thought was focused on keeping my butt cheeks watertight. At last I reached the campground. Of course the ranger station is at the farthest end of the park. And of course the restrooms are closed, although the place is full of picnickers.At the Ranger Station, the ranger behind the counter said ""I know why you're here. You're sick. Don't come any closer."" She called a shuttle service for me, and, after I agreed to pay the extortionary rate, she said the shuttle would be here in 90 minutes.

By day's end, I had surprised myself with 19.4 miles - a new El Vago world record.During the course of the day I passed through Newfound Gap, which is on the border of NC and TN. The Gap has a busy parking area, with scores of visitors and day hikers milling about in addition to thru-hikers. There are also several trash cans at the parking lot, which offer a priceless opportunity to dump dead weight. I availed myself of this gift - I cannot fully explain why ridding myself of 4 ounces of garbage can bring so much pleasure.The joy was shortlived, however, when I came across a dry sack lying next to the trash bin. It was obviously accidentally dropped by a thru-hiker because it had an AT tag dangling from it. The owner was nowhere in sight, so I picked it up and attached it to the outside of my pack. Perhaps, I thought, I will bump into its owner at the next shelter. It weighed more than the trash I had unloaded, so I had not done well with this exchange.As I hiked up out of Newfound Gap, I found myself amidst many of the day hikers, some of which took a special interest in me.

Truth is this was a real ego booster. I didn't have the heart to tell them the hike is not as glamorous as it seems on paper.One family of four, a husband, wife, and two youngsters, kept pace with me and peppered me with every question imaginable. How do you get food on the trail? Water? Where do you sleep? I loved the attention. While we were chatting, I saw a young man, in his twenties, racing down the mountain, leaping from rock to rock at a reckless speed. He wore no backpack and carried in one hand a wooden walking stick that was long enough to push a gondola through a Venice canal. He wore a frantic expression. When he came alongside me I asked if he had lost a sack. He stopped dead. I turned to show him the bag on the back of my pack. You're a lifesaver, he said. He unclipped the sack. So you're UPS, too, cried the husband who watched the event unfold. I laughed and said, No, just you're everyday mule.

We each had our tale to tell about the happenings over the past 7 days after we went separate ways. Tomorrow we will set off together for Erwin, TN, about a five days hike from Hot Springs. I look forward to walking with him again. In stark contrast to yesterday's miserable weather, today's was ideal. Sunny, in the 70s, not a cloud in the sky, it was the perfect day for hiking and the perfect day for taking a zero. Unable to do both, we chose the more perfect option to rest our weary bones, dry our equipment, and increase our calorie intake. I learned from yesterday's soaking and bought myself a rain kilt. It's quite the fashion statement. The weather this week should put it to the test. Rain forecast for tomorrow and Thursday and snow mixed with rain on Friday promise us a challenging week. Makes me glad I rested up before the next onslaught.","Hot Springs

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558920,"I've been out on the AT for just over a month now, and I've covered nearly 285 miles. But I know there are some astute mathematicians out there who have calculated my daily mileage and are wondering whether I'll make it to Katahdin before the turn of the New Year. Well, I'm wondering, too. But here's how I think it will happen. First, I have just about developed good trail legs, which means I can average about 2 mph. Presently, I can do this for about six to eight hours per day. So, barring any injury, illness, or other setback, I should be able to average 12 to 15 miles per day this month.And summer is coming, which means more daylight hours. Not to mention, warmer temperatures allow me to unload the heavier gear in exchange for lighter stuff, like clothing and sleeping bag. A light backpack is a hiker's friend. These things can only help to beef up that daily average.Finally, I understand it's mostly flat or downhill from here on out, so it will be a breeze. Therefore, no worries. That said, I ""only"" did 11 miles today. The first day out of a resupply town normally has two disadvantages. One is that I'm carrying more food, in this case five days of food. That amounts to an extra 10 pounds. The second is that it's predominantly uphill. Towns are normally situated in gaps between mountains. You descend to enter them and ascend when you leave. It also did not help that it rained for part of the day. While I looked marvelous in my sporty new rain kilt, it did cut down on my mobility. These are my excuses, and I'm sticking to them. Just wait and see what tomorrow brings!","Hot Springs

Normally 15 plus miles is a challenging enough, but the terrain was the most difficult we've seen thus far, climbing up and down an exposed rocky ridge line for an eternity. Moreover, rain turned to hail which turned to sleet which turned to snow. The going became slick and slow. My new kilt passed the test, keeping my pants dry, but I was still uncomfortably wet and cold at my core. As long as I kept moving I was fine, but one can't walk forever. Under such conditions we decided to go over to the dark side, to sleep among the mice, to share my snoring with the multitude, yes, to sleep in the shelter. It was a much faster way to warm up than pitching a tent. Also, two denizens of the shelter, named Frodo and Nopoles, hung their tarps at the front to block the wind. With seven guys inside, one more than the shelter's capacity, it got toasty and comfortable, even if it smelled like a gym. I slept well, which I attribute to the level flooring of the shelter. And no mice made any guest appearances, which my fellow shelter sharers attribute to my chainsaw snoring.Lastly, we went over the 300 mile mark today. We're almost 13% done!","Spring Mt. Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559526,"When the urge comes upon me, no matter how warm and comfortable I am in my bag, I know there is no going back to sleep, though I have tried. When I'm sleeping in the privacy of my tent, I find my trusty Gatorade bottle and settle matters discretely. But when you're packed like sardines in a shelter, shoulder to shoulder with your neighbors, the Gatorade bottle is out of the question. So I must don my headlamp, which has a red light feature, unzip my bag, quietly, so as not to wake anyone, lest they know the old geezer's getting up to pee again, shimmy down my air matress, jump off the raised shelter platform, hopefully landing onto my crocs, and stumble out of the shelter into the bracing air and snow covered ground, looking for just the right place to relieve oneself, about two feet away from the shelter entrance, and then fumble back into the bag. Did this twice last night. Still haven't figured out this sleeping thing. On the upside, I could see that the snow had stopped and could feel that the temperature had risen. There would be better hiking conditions today.At about 7 am, before anyone else in the shelter stirred, Scotty and I started packing to go on our way. For the first time on the trail, I had to dress myself in frigid, damp socks and shirt (my pants were warm because I wore them to bed). My Marmot rain jacket was frozen stiff. It was a rude awakening. But within a few minutes of hiking, I had warmed up considerably. O the marvels of the human body combined with good clothing.The AT trail is well marked and easy to follow, except when a few inches of snow obscure the path and cover the white blazes on the trees. At various points we paused to make sure we had not gone off trail and forged on without incident. Our footprints served as a guide to those who later followed us.Walking through snow, even only a few inches deep, is tiresome, like trying to run through sand on a beach. In some drifts the depth was over a foot. Our pace was slower than usual. When the trail descended into a grassy meadow, we encountered no snow, just mud. But the trail doesn't stay in the valleys long, and soon we were pushing through snow again.The crowning achievement of the day was summitting Lick Rock, a 1600 foot climb in 2.9 miles. I count my steps to distract myself from the relentless uphill misery. As long as I keep my feet moving, however small the steps, I eventually get to the top. It's not as difficult as it used to be.At Hogback Ridge Shelter all campsites lay covered in snow, so we opted for our second consecutive shelter stay. Again, it was a full house. Frodo and Nopoles set up tarps across the entrance, which improves the experience immeasurably. A mouse taunted us before sundown, from the safety of a crack in a shelter wall, watching and waiting for us to fall asleep in order to wreak its havoc. We crossed paths with several Nobos who were slack packing south that day on a 21-mile jaunt to Laurel Hostel. Slack packers travel light, leaving their tent and sleeping bag at their destination, carrying food and water for the day only, and extra clothing for safety. Every one of them looked exhausted, worn out by the tough going through the snow. Each rued their decision to slack pack that day.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Our objective was to split the remaining 26 miles into two reasonable sections so we could reach Erwin by midday on the second day. There were two shelters along the way, Bald Mt. Shelter and No Business Shelter, but Bald was too close to us, only 10 miles, and No Business was too far, at 21 miles, so we chose Whispering Gap as a suitable midpoint.The day started magnificently. We came upon two trail magic stations within tenths of a mile of each other. Quiet Paul -- aptly named, since it was like pulling teeth just to have him tell us his trail name, he hardly spoke to us --manned the first station and served huge helpings of scrambled eggs and hash browns. He had coolers filled with soft drinks and beer. I had a Coke with breakfast, go figure. Scotty hesitated above an open cooler, gazing longingly at a Pabst Blue Ribbon can, his mind calculating the time in England as being well past noon. But he thought better of it, it being only 9:30 am after all. After filling our gullets to overflowing, we came upon an elaborate table arrangement, with fruit of various kinds, hot cocoa, and hot dogs. I had a Del Monte can of pears; its syrupy juice never tasted so good. I couldn't bring myself to have a hot dog, but I did run off with a banana in the brain of my backpack. Thank heavens I did, because that banana helped counteract the turmoil Quiet Paul's greasy hashbrowns were causing in my lower intestines. Reaching the top of Big Bald Mt. was today's highlight. The peak offered us a 360-degree view. The wind blew hard and cold up there, so we stayed just long enough to snap a few photos and fire off some text messages.Coming down from Big Bald Mt. was touch and go. The decline was steep and ankle deep in mud because of the melted snow. Each step was uncertain. Sometimes I was skiing through it. I narrowly averted falling at least a dozen times. The campsite at Whispering Gap was excellent for setting up tents, relatively flat, sunny, snowless, and mudless. Seven of us camped there that night, Pogo, Maple, Dead Guy Ale, Baseman, Toodles, Scotty, and I. I noticed the trousers of a few of them were covered in mud.

It had been a grueling four days, and we were ready for a refreshing zero. The weather was ideal for hiking from the start, sunny, warm, short-sleeved conditions. Best yet, the trail to town was mostly downhill.I had a remarkable amount of pep to carry me the distance. My ipod shuffle had something to do with this. With Queen's ""We are the Champions"" booming in my ears, I felt like running up the mountains. The only downer of the day was the lack of privies along this final stretch. Some hikers have described crapping in the woods as a spiritual experience, a moment of becoming one with nature. I describe the experience as a colossal mess, causing a shameful waste of toilet paper and leaving an environmental hazard. I've yet to achieve the required 6 inch deep hole in the ground. Who has the time to dig that deep? And I've yet to hit a bullseye.

We walked over five miles visiting the various pharmacies, grocery stores, and restaurants. Not having to carry a 35-pound sack made the walking easy. Surprisingly, we were the only persons in town walking about, despite the gorgeous weather. Scotty is astounded by the love Americans have for their cars, particularly large ones, and how rarely we walk. Guilty as charged. I'm reminded how infrequently I walk into my MA town though it's only about a mile away from home. On a different note, I'm trying something new. It's been no secret that a good night's sleep has eluded me on the trail. I do fare better in hotels, but even then I rarely sleep through the night. So I picked up Advil PM. Let's see how it goes.

It was going to be a tough uphill 12 mile climb, and the sooner we started, the sooner we'd be done. We left the Super8 by 7:30 a.m. But first a stop at Huddle House for a quick breakfast. Mistake one. The diner was understaffed. Service was slooooooow. I had to get silverware myself from behind the kitchen counter. The lone waiter saw me and seemed appreciative of the help. While we waited for coffee, I used the idle time to call Uncle Johnny's shuttle service to bring us back to the trailhead, only 2.3 miles away. We understood that Uncle Johnny's made a scheduled stop at Huddle House. How convenient for us. Mistake two. Whereas the shuttle van would arrive at somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00, it would not leave until 10. Yikes. I dialed other shuttle services and found nothing better. Just as well, we might not even get our coffee by 10.At around 9, midway in our eating, the van pulled up to the diner and out poured 8 hikers and the van driver, a gray beard wearing a coyote hat with earflaps. He deliberately looked the part of a southern hick. They came into the restaurant and occupied two tables. They had come for breakfast. It was inconceivable to me that they would be fed before noon. I introduced myself to the driver to make sure he had space in the van. He did, and there would be 13 of us.When Scotty and I finished breakfast, we decided to wait on the front lawn in the warm sunshine. I watched the front door to the breakfast house, wary that they would slip out and leave us hanging. They did not slip out until half past ten. We joined them to reserve out spots. The group then huddled by the van and waited interminably while three other passengers finished their meals inside. Finally, 13 of us piled in (the driver made 14), and we pulled out. We were on our way, so I believed. Instead he drove us directly across the street to a fast food drive-thru window, where he proceeded to place a large order. Scotty and I looked at each other in amazement. Luckily it was a fast food joint.We then drove about a city block and stopped at Walgreens, where a passenger jumped out and disappeared for a dog's year inside, while we idled in the parking lot. We idled so long the driver turned off the ignition. I laughed aloud. At last, the person returned and we were truly on our way. We reached the hostel at 11:15, 45 minutes after getting in the van. Oddly, I was relaxed and resigned to the laid back ways of Tennessee.

Initially today's itinerary was to stop at Overmountain shelter, a converted barn that sleeps 20. Our path took us over Roan Mt., another 6000 footer. I started off ahead of Scotty, as I tend to have my most energy at the start of the day, during the cool of the morning. Lunch consisting of tuna and cheese on a tortilla was served at the Roan Mt. shelter, said to be the highest shelter on the AT. This building had a door and windows, quite elaborate as shelters go. Met a father (King James), two sons, two daughters, and their dog Moja at the shelter. Mom was missing. They inquired about her, but I said I had not passed her. I later saw her waiting for them at a parking lot about 2 miles down the trail. She had missed the turnoff to the shelter. Easy to do, as the sign was none too large.It was another fine day for hiking, warm and sunny, and I was in rare form. I arrived at the Overmountain before 3 p.m., too early to stop for the day, and pushed on though i had already traveled over 15 miles. The toughest was yet to come. Ahead of me were two massive grassy bald mountains called Hump and Big Hump. The general direction was up. It took me an hour to climb Hump and 90 minutes to climb Big Hump. But the views from atop made the profusive sweating worth it.My new objective was Doll Flats, a campsite at the TN-NC border. The descent carried me over a open ridge with vistas in every direction. It was heavenly. To top it off, later four deer dashed down a wooded hill in front of me. Their thrashing through leaves and bushes made me aware of their presence, otherwise I might have missed them.Doll Flats turned out to be an idyllic campsite, an open grassy meadow nestled among mountains. True to its name, the area was flat, well suited for pitching a tent.

Also, I don't have enough food to make it there, so I will need to resupply today. It's going to be a busy day.I reach the Black Bear Resort by 11:30 a.m., a hostel about 0.4 miles off the AT. It has a store where I buy enough supplies for two more days. On the porch outside of the store, I take off my pack, lay done my poles, take off my boots, and sink my teeth into a microwaved cheeseburger. Yum yum. I polish of a Klondike bar. I chitchat with a few hikers entering and leaving the store. After resting for 30 minutes, I prepare to return to the trail. It's then I notice my poles are gone. Full panic ensues. There's no chance of hiking without them. On countless occasions they have restored my balance. I ask everyone in the vicinity if they noticed anyone taking my poles. No witnesses. I become resigned to the situation. I will need to buy a new pair at the nearest outfitters. Just as I arrive at this conclusion, a shuttle van pulls up in front of the store, and Ho Chi Minh jumps out holding my poles. (He got this trail name because of the hat he wears, a cymbal shaped cap famously worn by Vietmanese villagers.) At sight of the poles, my heart leaped for joy - my lost poles had been found.Restocked with goods and with poles restored, I return to the trail. The trail takes me through a deep chasm leading downwards to Laurel Falls. It is beautiful to see, and dozens of hikers have stopped to enjoy the view and feel its cool mist. A fast moving and deep stream flows from its base. I remove my boots and socks and soak my steaming feet in the cold waters. My feet are pleased and thank me profusely. I thank them for having gotten me this far and gently inform them they must still carry me over Pond Mountain. Pond Mountain: the person or people who decided the AT should go over this mountain are sadists. It's a 2.6 mile vertical wall, or so it seems. It takes me 2 hours to reach the summit. As soon as it reaches the top, the trail goes back down to the same elevation I started from. What is the point of this? To convince thru-hikers to go home.I go to the Boots Off hostel, rent an upper bunk, and take an outdoor shower. Water is piped into a tin wash basin with a dozen holes in it. I stand under the basin, and the water pours through the holes onto my head. It works like a charm.
That night the Boots Off hostel surprises everyone with an Easter dinner of ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, salad, pecan pie, chips, and pizza. Over 15 of us eat from their buffet. I go back for seconds. I love this hostel and give them two thumbs up.
The hostel also is a site of many reunions. I see Pogo again. And Hopalong, who I have not seen since Georgia. And LowTech, who I've not seen since Standing Bear Farm.

I pass Watauga Shelter, which is closed because of bear activity. Rumor has it a hiker staying at the shelter rubbed coconut oil on his body before tucking in for the night and later discovered he had become the center of a bear's attention. Note to self, use coconut oil in hotel room only.The trail takes me to Watauga Dam, a small earthen road perhaps 3 car lanes wide and 0.3 mIles long. On one side is the lake, on the other a vertigo inducing droppoff. The lake is enormous and stretches for miles, and I am surprised how such a little dam holds the entire thing in place.As I cross the dam, 8track catches up to me. This is a shock because I thought he was at least a day ahead of me based on the dates he signs in the shelter registries. Turns out he's got the date wrong, signing one day earlier than the actual date. Easy mistake to make. One loses track of dates and days of the week out here.He gives me a breakfast burrito, made by his wife. She's providing trail magic at Watauga Lake.

I'm reluctant, but when he explains the logistics, that his wife is driving a mobile home and will bring the bulk of my pack's contents to the town and have them waiting for me, I am sold. We part ways because he is currently slack packing and moving twice my speed.I find today's hiking tough going. The first half of the day involves a steady climb. My legs resist I suppose because of yesterday's ascent of the monstrous Pond Mt.

Besides, it was her reward for having walked 14 miles in two days.Two scoop marvels in our mitts, we sat under a covered porch and marveled at the rain, which now had become a torrential downpour. This only encouraged us to eat our cones even slower. But the trail doesn't walk itself, so we ventured out from our cover to find the rain had all but stopped. When we reached the center of town we saw over a half dozen state trooper autos, a few with flashing blue lights. Some were parked in front of our B&B. We could only wonder what our host was up to. So much commotion for such a little town. Turns out a funeral was in progress, being held for a local policeman who turned his own revolver on himself. Apparently things were not faring well in his professional and family life. We got the sordid details indirectly from the town barber. Tragic, really. Quite sad. When the funeral ended, traffic was at a standstill for about 15 minutes. There's only one road in and out of town, and everyone was on it.","Stealth Site

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561418,"Time passes so quickly, and Diane is heading back to MA this morning. The thought flashes through my mind, how nice it'd be to go back with her. But I'm too far along to bail out now. And I know she wouldn't take me anyways. Before she goes, she drops me off at the trailhead where we started our southbound hike two days ago. I will resume my northbound journey from that point. It is raining again, the fifth consecutive day with some precipitation. This is getting tiresome. My raincoat has become my second skin, and gills are forming behind my ears.I disappear once more into the depths of the wilderness and into my circular thoughts. Since I've had so much time to think on the trail I've discovered I tend to think about the same few things ad nauseum. I try to force myself to think novel thoughts, but eventually I start thinking again about how many miles I have left to hike today and what time I expect to arrive at my planned destination. Today's destination is a shelter just north of Mt. Rogers, which is the biggie in VA. I pass by the blue blaze leading to its summit - the clouds are ominous and a drizzle is in the air. Chances are there is no view from atop anyway. The questionable weather leads me to stay in the shelter tonight. I'm joined by Little Cheese, Einstein, Pogo, and Tailgate. As dusk settles in, four ponies come to the shelter entrance. I'm sure they are up to no good, noticing they are paying keen attention to our bear bags hanging low nearby off hooks at the shelter's front. Tailgate bangs his poles together, shooing them away. They ignore him. It becomes dark. One pony stays, waiting us out. Luckily, I think, a troup of night hikers arrive at camp, with a dog. Surely they will drive the pony away. The pony ignores the dog; the dog ignores the pony. The pony stays. Then it starts to pour, and the pony runs for cover. I fall asleep fully expecting my bear bag of food to be missing come morning, or at least to find its contents on the ground, scattered and shredded. As I doze I realize, worst case, I could head into town at Massie Gap should I awaken to find myself a food pauper.","Damascus

There's no line for the privy before the sun is fully up.I'd not traveled more than 100 yards when a brown and white wild pony accosts me. I see it emerge from the woods, so I pull out my camera. It then occurs to me that the pony is heading straight for me, fast. At that moment, I was glad I had visited the privy before heading off, or there might have been some brown blazing. The animal goes directly for the waist pocket on my backpack, where I keep my energy bars. It starts nibbling at it, so I give him a thwack on the nose with my hiking pole. It stares at me in wonder, as though saying, ""Now why did you go and do that?"" After a moment's pause, it pushes at me again. I crosscheck it with my pole, keeping it between me and the beast. It leaves, heating towards the shelter. I leave a proud and mighty victor.Today's march takes me through the Grayson Highlands, the land of the wild ponies, but I see only one more though I walk through the park for hours. I pass through a rock formation known as fat man's squeeze, with no trouble at all. Perhaps 7 weeks ago I'd have experienced a little more difficulty, but I venture I have lost at least 15 pounds since March 1st. In the park I pass the 500 mile mark, another noteworthy milestone. Shortly after it starts to pour, coming down sideways, driven by a stiff wind. The ridiculousness of the situation makes me laugh. I ask a passing hiker, going southbound, also caught in the deluge, ""What are we doing out here?"" I hear a response muted by the wind and the rain pounding on my hood, ""I'm asking myself the same question.""Every dark cloud has a silver lining, and this one is trail magic down at The Scales, a corrall where cattle were in times past weighed. Another hiker heading southbound tells me about it, as encouragement. ""How far away is it?"" I ask. ""About one and a half miles,"" he replies. ""Oh, that's a little too far for me to run."" But I do pick up the pace.After devouring a hot dog, two meatball subs, a package of yodels, potato chips, and I bottle of water, I am refueled and ready. But the skies are a fury. Gusts are all but ripping the canopies from their stakes and water is falling in sheets. In comes Pogo, followed shortly by Tailgate. They feast, too. We chitchat about the miserable conditions, I eat an oatmeal creme cookie, and the wind abates. This is my chance, I say thanks to my gracious hosts, toss a nightmarish 35 pounds onto my back, and lumber on my way.About two hours later, Pogo and Tailgate catch up to me. Both are about 35 years my junior, so this is no surprise. We are all heading for the same shelter tonight, Hurricane Mt. Shelter. Its name is troubling. The youngsters get their well before me, but I find they have not gone to the structure. Rather, they wait for me on the trail and ask if I'd be interested in doing 5 more miles with them. Flattered that they think I can do 5 more miles, I say yes. We knock those miles off in two hours. But now it's raining hard, and I'm thinking we probably should have stopped at the shelter. I set up my tent in pouring rain, spending about 30 minutes mopping up rainwater inside my tent with both my bandanas. My air mattress raises me above the damp tent floor. Bear bagging is a foregone conclusion; any animal out in this mess is welcome to my food. I sleep with my bag of food at my side. The other guys are sleeping with theirs, too, so I figure my odds at 33%. I fall asleep quickly to the patter of raindrops on the fly of the tent and to the occasional drop of mist that falls to my bag.","Thomas Knob Shelter

It takes me forever to break camp in rain, me trying to be careful to pack the bag without soaking every item. It's a fruitless effort.A road is not far, about a tenth of a mile away, but it's pitch dark. We walk to the road using our headlamps, thinking we can call a shuttle from there. We move on to a small grassy patch where a paved road intersects a gravel road. I have AT&T, which is utterly useless, so bad I hate them. He has Verizon, so perhaps he'll have a signal.His signal is weak, one bar, momentarily two. It's 5:15 a.m.. He gets through to a hotel, and they don't shuttle. Another hotel has a recording.

We walk 0.3 miles, and now Guthook says we're 0.6 miles away. Spirits crushed, we return to the grassy patch. Pogo is starting to shiver and decides to lay out tarp and his sleeping bag. He crawls inside. The rain is soaking his bag, and I'm feeling desperate. About 5 minutes pass, and I see headlights coming our way on the paved road. I start waving frantically, doing jumping jacks.

""The driver is on his way to fish. He can clearly see Pogo prostrate in the grass.""I don't have cell service, either,"" he says. I can tell he has no idea what he's stumbled upon and is trying to move on. ""Well, if you could at least get help for us, drive to town, call us a shuttle, anything. We're desperate. The town is only 2.6 miles away.""This must not seem too far because he invites us into his truck and drives us to Troutsdale, leaving us in a parking lot in front of a church. I thank him profusely. It takes some doing, but I find the church's hostel nearby. It has a shower, of which Pogo avails himself immediately, while I speak with the caretaker about Pogo's condition. He tells me he will take care of him. I bid farewell to him and Pogo and walk the lonely road back to the trailhead. It's still raining. A big dog barks at me from a nearby house, but I pay him no heed; I'm too emotionally drained to care.It's 8 a.m. I begin my hike for the day. The goal is the Partnership Shelter, maybe even the city of Marion. I'm soaked, and would like to dry out.The rain never lets up. The trail becomes a stream several inches deep or mud just as full. At first I sidestep the puddles and mud, but my waterproof boots are no longer waterproof. My feet squish about in their socks. Can't get much wetter, I reason, so I start splashing directly through the mire. You can get much wetter, and I did. The shelter seems like counties away. I curse each hill. It's an interminable hike. Then suddenly I come upon the shelter. It's gorgeous as shelters go, but I'm not staying. I move on to the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center. It has a landline phone - they must know AT&T sucks - and I reserve a hotel room and call a cab. No longer moving while I await the cab, I start to shiver. An outdoor thermometer says 48 degrees, prime conditions for hypothermia. To warm up I eat a large chocolate bar and do a few jumping jacks. Even a slight touch of my raincoat on my skin causes me to shake. At long last, the cab arrives and I jump inside. He has the heater running and the car is toasty. The first words from my mouth, before I tell him where I want to go, are ""Thank you for having the car warmed up.""I lay in a comfy hotel bed, my clothes and equipment strewn about, and the heater blasting in the dim hope that all articles will dry overnight.

The forecast for today calls for more rain, but not as heavy as yesterday's. The region experienced flooding as more than two inches fell. Some schools are closed, others have a two hour delay. 
I call Marion Transit to bring several of us back to the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center, from where we fled the day before. This bus service charges only 50 cents. In contrast, yesterday we called a cab to drive us from the Visitor Center to Marion, and that cost 20 bucks.
The terrain I face this day is relatively easy, though fog obscures the forests and the views. It is a chilly fog, and the occasional gusts bring cold drops from the treetops. The dank weather wears on me. We've had rain during some part of the day - and all day yesterday - for over a week now. Hoping to see the sun, any time now.
We find the streams swollen from the rain. In many places, rushing water covers the trail, and I have to find another place to crossover, a place with enough stepping stones to reach the opposite bank. In one instance I cannot find a dry way across, so I remove my boots, gaiters, and socks to keep them dry, and stumbled through barefoot with my pant legs rolled up high. Not sure why I bothered, because my boots and socks become soaked further down the path by the deep water in the meadows through which I must walk.
Little Cheese and Einstein and I take a room at the Relax Inn, a one-star gem with a laundry room. Laundry is important tonight as my pant legs are covered with mud past the knees. It's messy out there. In the evening we walk to the Barn for some ""homemade"" cooking. We suspect much of our meals came directly from cans. 
On a disappointing note, Scotty pulled me aside this morning to tell me he was leaving the trail. He says he can no longer deal with the boredom of seeing the same trees and rocks for hours and days. And he misses his missus and pooch. I will miss him. He has been great company.","Mt. Rogers Visitor Center

Before dozing off last night, we talked about food.  It's astonishing how often food is the center of conversation.  Corky praised the food he had eaten the previous day at Trents Grocery.  The burger and fries he described were mouthwatering.  He also extolled its wondrous campsite.  That settled matters, I was going to reach the Grocery today.  So I pack up early and head off by 7 a.m.
Morning is to me the best time of the day to hike.  The birds are singing madly, and the sunlight is picturesque.  The heat of the day is yet hours away.  I startle a deer, which walks away behind me, almost in a constant arc, until a tree is between it and me.  I let it be and continue towards the burger waiting for me 16 miles away.
On the way I pass the 600 mile mark. Wow! The number is getting big.  I later cross a suspension bridge spanning the Kimberling Creek.  It bobs and sways as I walk across so I cannot walk a straight line.  That brings me within 0.5 miles of the Grocery.  It is off trail, but I don't care, there's a burger up ahead waiting for me.
Trents Grocery is actually a gas station with a grill inside. The lady behind the counter is gruff.  She seems annoyed that I place an order. She's so rude to me I almost ask her if she's from Massachusetts, but I don't dare, for the fate of my burger is in her hands. I notice there are tables inside where I can eat, however, I don't want to leave my pack ouside because of all the auto traffic. So I work up my nerve to ask the lady if I could bring my pack inside.  She just says no. Period.
I eat outside on a bench near the door.  The burger is delicious.  As are the fries.  There are no other customers inside, so she comes out for a smoke and stands two feet from me. I decide I will not camp here tonight. That will teach her a lesson.
After my meal I realize I have no legs left to go back to the trail.  I will camp here after all.  I meekly approach the shrew and ask for a site.  She collects my 6 bucks and goes about her business.  I stand there lost in confusion.  She notices me and says ""Just go into the field."" I look out the window and see fields everywhere.  Noticing my befuddlement she adds, ""Go through the gate."" I see no gate, but can't muster enough courage to ask. Instead I ask, ""How much for the shower and laundry.""  ""Included,"" she says.  Now that's good news.
I leave the store, grab my pack, and wander about looking for a field behind a gate. The best candidate is a gravel road that leads into a trailer park.  There are no tents, just several abandoned looking trailers.  There is hiker trash everywhere.  There is a trash heap with appliances piled high at the end of the road. 
A tractor drives slowly by.  Two men are riding in it. I flag it down and ask if I have found the campsite. They tell me I have.  ""Can I set up my tent anywhere?"" ""I can,"" they say, but that's no help because this place looks unsuitable for tents. They also show me the building with the showers and laundry room.  It gives me the skeeves. They leave, and I watch as they go to the trash heap to drop off a rubber tire.  I peek inside the showers and discover there are no towels. The tractor comes back, and I ask for a towel.  They tell me towels have been walking off.  I promise them I will leave it when I'm done.  They acquiesce, say they will get me one, and motor off.
While they are away, I find an open area equidistant from the showers and hulk of trailers, and set up my tent. The tractor returns, and the driver hands me a towel that's the size of a washcloth, and a washcloth that's the size of a postage stamp.  I am profusely grateful.
I take a shower, an immeasurable delight, and I start my laundry.  There is no detergent, but I find fabric softener.  Afterwards, my clothes still smell nasty, but they feel great. 
As I am doing the laundry, Hookset and Razorback arrive and set up their tents near mine.  Hookset is effusive.  ""Isn't this place great? A campsite, shower, and laundry for just six bucks.""  Razorback is equally ecstatic.  He FaceTimes his wife and shows her the nearby mountains, creek, and horse in the neighboring field. He is genuinely delighted.  I am amazed at their attitudes and disappointed at my own.  They see the bright spots in the situation; I focus on the negatives. I am humbled.","Helveys Mill Shelter

I find myself nearing the top of a ridgeline while the skies slowly darken, not exactly where I ought to be. Calling upon some unknown source of reserve energy, I dash to make it to the downward side of the ridge.

I had wanted to travel to Pickle Branch Shelter today, but pulled up short because of the weather report. Big rain was due at 2 p.m. The wind was strong and the sky overcast.  It felt like it could rain at any moment. So I set up my tent at Niday shelter and waited.  The showers came at 5 and continued in earnest for the next 13 hours.  Most of the night the rainfall pounded the tent. Turns out to have been a good choice to turn in early.  Packing up a wet tent is tomorrow guy's problem.Earlier that day on the way to Niday Shelter I passed the Keefer Oak, over 300 years old and the largest oak tree in the south on the trail.  I also came upon a sign identifying the Eastern Continental Divide.  On one side of the divide, water flows to the Gulf of Mexico,  on the other, towards the Atlantic Ocean.  To put it to the test, I poured water at the base of the sign.  It pooled and went nowhere.  Such a disappointment.","Laurel Creek Shelter

I would not have wanted to climb down while it was raining.After surviving the Dragon's Tooth, I reached the 4 Pines Hostel, just in time for a shuttle ride to the Homeplace restaurant.

They give thru-hikers free banana pudding.  It was better than my appetizer and entree.

I also took particular satisfaction in knowing my Guthook trail guide considers me to be in Northern Virginia. These small milestones add up and keep me motivated.  
It's unseasonably cold, which makes for good hiking weather actually, except when the wind blows at higher elevations.  When walking the high ridges, I rue having sent my gloves and wool hat back home.

Just outside of Troutville I crossed a meadow where dozens of cows were munching. The one in the photo blocked my path and had no intentions of moving aside.  I gave it wide berth, especially after seeing it lick its chops, as though I was some delicious hamburger.
A section of today's hike crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP) several times. Each crossing occurred near a parking lot, typically with a grand view of the surrounding mountains. Being near the BRP makes me realize how far north I've come - not quite in Yankee territory yet, but now its within walking distance.

",Johns Hollow Shelter,"May 10, Wed",16.30
El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564339,"Key to my plans today was calling for a shuttle once I reached US 60, a two lane, paved highway leading into Buena Vista.  To get there from Johns Hollow Shelter entailed 10 hours of hiking, including a 2000 foot climb up Big Rocky Row and another 800 foot climb of Punchbowl Mountain.  I left the shelter at 6:30 a.m., because I wanted to have enough time in town after I arrived to get dinner.  
True to form, it rained in the morning for about an hour and again in the late afternoon for another hour.  I was thoroughly soaked, pants, drawers, shirt, and raincoat.  My rain gear keeps the rain out, but makes me sweat profusely, especially during the climbs. At least the temps were in the 60s, so I was not chilled by rain or sweat, just uncomfortably wet.  But I was going to town tonight, and the prospects of a warm meal, a hot shower, and a warm bed were incentives for enduring the momentary unpleasantness.
I was pleased to reach US 60 at 4:00, 30 minutes ahead of plan. Buena Vista was 9.3 miles west.  Now was the time to contact a shuttle service to pick me up.  Across the highway was a picnic table, where I dropped off my pack and turned on my phone (I had turned it off to save power). When I needed it most, AT&T failed me -- I had no service, not one stinking bar. 
I was alone. My only resort was to hitchhike.  As instructed by a hitchhiking pro, I put my poles in front of me and my pack on my back, so that it was clear I was a hiker and not a homeless man.  I picked a spot where traffic heading into Buena Vista would be moving slowly because it would be climbing a hill. Also, the spot where I stood was located just before a wide shoulder, so that a prospective ride would have space to pull over.
Nobody stopped. Some sped up as they passed, me with my thumb held boldly high in the air and a stupid grin on my face.  I became despondent.  Walking into town was unfeasible, it being 9 miles away, I would be walking in the dark.  And I was exhausted.
I looked at my useless phone again, hoping that somehow it had acquired service.  No such luck. Might as well keep trying to hitch a ride. I looked about me for a place to pitch my tent.  If all else fails, I'd set up camp.  
I returned to my post and experimented with my facial expressions as cars went by.  I smiled wide, I grinned, I looked serious, I looked desperate, I looked the drivers in the eyes, I looked away demurely, all the while in my thru-hiker pose. Imagine my surprise when an SUV pulled over onto the wide shoulder.  I ran to it, fearful the driver would have a change of heart. Its back door swung open, I threw in my bag, a jumped inside an elated man.
My driver was Wayne Wingfield,  an 80-year old minister.  I don't normally pick up hitchhikers, he said. Neither does anyone else, I said. The Holy Spirit told me to stop, he said. I'm sure thankful you listened, I said.
The road into Buena Vista was tortuous.  The many curves, the narrow shoulders, the fast moving traffic, I could not have safely walked this road.  He drove remarkably well for an 80-year old, but I was nervous just the same.  He was in the oncoming lane about as often as he was in the proper lane.  At one point he passed a lumber truck, honking his horn madly as we went by it.  I don't know why.  
Wayne was friendly and talkative. After asking me many questions about what I was doing out there, where I was from, what I did for a living, he opened up about his own life.  Presently he is caring for his ailing wife who is in the last stages of dementia.  She no longer knows who he is.  Sad.
Upon reaching Budget Inn, he asked if he could pray with me.  Surely, I said.  And we prayed together in the car.  Godspeed, good man.  You are indeed a trail angel.
That night in Buena Vista, I ate two Subway foot-long subs and a double chocolate chip cookie.  Not a warm meal, but quite satisfying. 
As an aside, after crossing the Pedlar Bridge I soon also crossed the 800 mile mark. One step at a time is actually turning into something.","Johns Hollow Shelter

Can't say much of note happened while in town.  I ate breakfast at Burger King and afterwards searched for the town infirmary to have my stomach pumped.  My body was upset with my brain all morning long.  Unfortunately, no lesson was learned, and I was gobbling a Hardee's Jalapeño double meat cheeseburger by 1 p.m.  I've eaten more fast food on this hike than I could ever have imagined, and loving it.
I also went ""yard"", having eaten my third foot-long Subway sandwich in two days.
Lastly, Family Dollar provided all of the nutrients needed to reach Waynesboro. To my dismay, there had been a run on the Little Debbie honey buns, and the shelf was empty.  I had to settle for a 210-calorie knockoff, scarcely half the calorie count of the real thing.  I'll need to eat two of them to attain the same sugar high.

Avoiding Friday's rain, although it did not reach the apocalyptic proportions forecast by Chicken Little on the Weather Channel, was a morale booster.  My feet were pleased to wear crocs instead of boots (which are still holding up well after 850 miles).  And my tired legs thanked me for the day off.
A shuttle driver brought me to the US 60 trailhead at 8:15 a.m., and I thus began a 2000 foot ascent out of town to the top Bald Knob, which is actually not bald.  I find it more palatable to deal with climbs first thing in the morning than later in the afternoon.  It's an energy issue; I have less and less as the day progresses.  At higher elevations, fog obscured the woods. The bellowing of cows somewhere below on some unseen farm followed me along the climb. 
Long ascents like today's have one endearing characteristic; they have many false peaks.  When you are trudging upwards for what seems like eternity, and your brow and chest are soaked with sweat, you long to see the slope lessen because this tells you you're getting close to the top.  Each crest brings hope. Often, though, the terrain continues to rise beyond that crest, and the hope of having reached the peak is temporarily dashed. The not-so-bald Bald Knob had numerous false peaks. But, eventually, even if you move at a snail's pace, you reach the top.  Some wise man once said, ""It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you don't stop."" 
Later in the day I took a short side trail to Spy Rock.  It was a sizeable rock scramble, so I left my pack at its base.  For me it was not a trivial climb.  But the 360° view from atop Spy Rock was worth jeopardizing life and limb. (It wasn't that bad, but falling off would have left a mark.)  
I reached The Priest Shelter around 7 p.m., with plenty of daylight remaining to  set up camp.  My bear bagging, however, was done hastily and poorly. The food bag hung within arm's reach from the ground, which would elude Boo Boo's grasp but be easy pickings for Yogi.  Still, this was better than sleeping with the bag tucked by my side.  And I was too weary to look for a better tree.  Besides, there are no bears out here, or I would have seen one by now.","Buena Vista

But then I awoke from this dream, relieved greatly.  Yes, I had a dream within a dream.  Very strange indeed.  Truly awake now, I went to my food bag and found it perfectly intact.  I will be sure to take better care of bear bagging from here on out.
In honor of Mother's Day the weather conditions were ideal for hiking, sunny and warm.  Too bad the terrain was tough. Ascending Three Ridges Mountain knocked the stuffing out of me. It was a 2200 foot climb extending 3 miles, and  my legs were still a bit wobbly from yesterday's long haul.  A section of it is called Chimney Rock for the simple reason of its vertical nature. The reward for the effort was a breathtaking view from Hanging Rock Overlook.  It was a huge cliff. Since the National Forest Service had neglected to put up guard rails, I stayed a safe distance from its edge. Anyone unlucky enough to fall over the edge would still be falling even now.

Meanwhile I bought a bag of kettle corn and a Dr. Pepper and waited.  A yellow truck pulled up next to the picnic table where I sat.  In a moment of brilliance I asked him, ""Are you Yellow Truck?"" ""Yes,"" he said, ""Hurry up.""
He was a crotchety old guy who took pride in his crotchetyness.  ""You smell, you're ugly, and I don't want to know your trail name.

Pogo, who I have not seen since I dropped him off at a hostel in Troutville  (or was it Troutsdale?), came into camp.  It was an utter delight to meet up with him.  We revisited all that happened that fateful day.  It was a pleasant way for the day to close.","Bearfence Hut

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565817,"My plan for today was to end the hike at Open Arms hostel.  It provides free pick up and drop off shuttle services from Thorton Gap, a mere 14 miles from Rock Spring. I prearranged the ride into town, and all I had to do was get to the Gap by 3 p.m.Along the way, however, I made a spontaneous decision to eat second breakfast at the Skyland Restaurant. It offered an AYCE buffet.  This was another brilliant choice on my part.  I ate to my stomach's content. I also chatted with Already Stinky and Lucky Penny for well over an hour, sitting on a comfy sofa, sipping coffe, in the restaurant's lobby. When you feel sugar deprived, you crave a soda, protein deprived you crave a burger, and furniture deprived you crave a comfy sofa.  It was time we'll spent, but now I would not make my 3 pm appointment with the shuttle. Fortunately, I received cell service along the way and rescheduled pick up for 4:30.Alison of the Open Arms hostel arrived right on schedule and brought me to the hostel in Luray. After I settled my things and took a refreshing shower, she brought me to Walmart in town so I could do a resupply, but not before taking me to Mimslyn Inn, a 1930s speakeasy. That night, one of the hikers staying at the hostel, Miles, who is a chef, made chicken parmesan and linguini.  I had seconds and slept that night on a Posturepedic mattress a sated man.","Rock Spring Hut

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566475,"The hike started out pleasantly enough, the weather was fine, Alison of the Open Arms hostel dropped me off at the trailhead around 9 a.m., and I had a relatively short distance of 14 miles in mind. About midday I stopped at the Elkwallow Wayside to gorge on burgers and to resupply my energy bars (I easily eat a dozen or more of these per week -- yuck!). I even tarried long at the picnic tables outside of the Wayside, not wanting to get to the shelter too early in the day. Although I killed about two hours there, I still arrived at Gravel Springs Hut with plenty of daylight remaining. 
Already at the hut, sitting about a picnic table in front of the shelter, were several hikers and a trail runner, whose trailname was Blissful. One of the hikers, named ForceFlex, surprised me by knowing my trailname, though I never met him before. I read your trail journal, he said, and I recognize you from your photos. I turned crimson, though I'm not sure why. ForceFlex was doing a short hike with his wife Curly Turtle, a practice run for their planned thru-hike in 2018. I excused myself to set up my tent, but promised to return to the table to eat dinner and to learn more about the folks who followed my progress.
Tent sites in the SNP are quite distant from the shelter, 50 to 100 yards or so. After much deliberation, I chose a site about 10 feet from the trail runner's and set up camp. With my entire food bag, stove, and water bottle, I returned to shelter and cooked my meal (Mountain House Chicken Teriyaki, my go to dinner). It was a terrific social hour, with much joking and laughter. I told ForceFlex about a 2012 thru-hiker I had met on the trail, who had kept a trail journal. One of his readers waited for him to reach a particular section of the trail, greeted him there, and surprised him and his companions with trail magic. After hearing this remarkable tale, ForceFlex simply said, Your trail journal hasn't risen to that level. Oh well, I tried.
In the midst of one of the jolliest times on the trail, Blissful, the trail runner, hurriedly approached me. El Vago, there's a rip in your tent, she said. My initial thought was that a seam in the fly had torn open, perhaps from overtightening it atop the tent poles. Instead I found a new door in the side of my tent, where a door ought not to be. I carefully looked through this opening to make sure that whatever animal did the demolition was not still lurking inside. Once I knew the marauder was not about, I surveyed the mess. The creature had torn another, smaller hole on the other wall of the tent. A ziploc bag with my journal inside had teeth marks, as did a ziploc with my phone recharger and other electronics. There also was a bag with toothpaste in it, left entirely untouched.
Meanwhile, the other hikers were checking their own tents to see if they, too, had a troublesome visitor. Blissful found small bear pawprints on the fly of her. Fortunately, the bear decided not to go for a deeper look. Another woman, Barb, did have damage. The bear had tried to drag her air mattress out of her tent, which was a considerable distance from Blissful's and my own. The mattress was ruined. I don't know about the condition of her tent.
Blissful had seen enough and requested that everyone break down their tents and sleep in the shelter. That night ten of us slept in a hut designed for eight. Blissful called for a Ranger to evacuate her from the site, leaving us a bit more sleeping space. Have a pile of rocks nearby to throw at the bear should it come to the shelter, she said. And after those words of reassurance, the Ranger's truck spirited her away.
That evening was electric. We talked well past hiker midnight (it got dark). I was moved by the comraderie. People who I had never before met were there to help. After I made it known that the bear had poked a hole in my air matress and coincidentally chewed my matress repair kit, I immediately had more offers of repair kits than I could possibly need. A group of strangers had become close knit friends because of our common predicament. We were told the site would be closed until the bear could be captured and relocated. You may have scored big, little bear, but the game's not over yet.","Luray, VA

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566675,"To the best of my knowledge the bear did not return during the night. In the light of morning, though, I realized the beast had wreaked more havoc than initially thought. The handgrip of one hiking pole had chew marks, presumably the result of the critter's taste for salt. I also discovered a one-inch gash in my sleeping bag, which I was able to patch. My Crocs, however, were missing, as were my gaiters, which were tucked into my Crocs. I had tethered the Crocs together with a carabiner, explaining why both were gone. The bear had also run off with a Smart water bottle that had my Sawyer filter still attached to it. This Curly Turtle found in the woods. Many thanks to her and Slip 'n Slide and others for helping me scour the woods. Despite our efforts, we never recovered the Crocs. Now what possible reason could a bruin have for stealing them?
The previous night's drama made me somewhat uneasy. I needed to regather my wits and get new gear, so I decided upon a short hike to the Terrapin Hostel, arriving before noon. As I was relating my plight to the hotel's owner, a gent who overheard the tale loaned me his tent. A true trail angel. Coincidentally he lives just 30 minutes from my home town in MA.
That afternoon at the hostel I ordered a new tent from Big Agnes, with delivery to Harper's Ferry scheduled for May 30th. Fingers crossed, I hope it arrives on schedule. Though I intend to sleep in shelters and hostels along the way, having the loaner tent gives me confidence to keep moving forward to the town. If, for any reason, I cannot find a place to sleep in those places, I always have the tent to fall back on.
That day I met and had dinner at El Maguay's in Front Royal with Influx, Daddy Long Legs, and Blue Steel.","Gravel Springs Hut

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566677,"My night of sleep at the hostel was worse than crummy. The bed was a huge air mattress that amplified every movement I made. It had more ridges than a Ruffles potato chip. After lying awake until midnight, I decided to try to sleep on the futon in the living room. 
Now I'm not particularly tall, but the four foot long futon was wholly inadequate to lay upon lengthwise. I tried the fetal position for a while, but it was futile. Sleep came in 15 minute stretches, at best. At 4 a.m., I returned to the air mattress and may have dozed for two hours. 
In a zombie-like state, I managed to cover 19 miles to reach the Dicks Dome Shelter and was pleased to find a place under its protective cover to park my carcass. Rain was imminent and expected to continue overnight. I did not want to set up the borrowed tent in the rain. The shelter I shared with Grapenut, a 22-year old gent from Houston, TX. He had recently returned to the trail after a 5-day hiatus due to a minor medical problem.","Terrapin Hostel

The rain held off for much of the day, and the sun even broke out for a while, but when we were four miles away from Bears Den Hostel a rainstorm descended the likes of which I had not yet encountered over the 1000 mile stint. Water fell in sheets. Hail pelted my raingear. Thunder rumbled overhead. The trail turned into calf - deep rapids. It was adrenaline pumping insanity.
The sign to the Bears Den Hostel mercifully appeared. It is a stone structure maintained by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. By far it was the best hostel I've yet to come upon. For $30, I received a large pizza, a soda, a pint of Ben and Jerry's, unlimited coffee, a shower, laundry, a comfy bed, and a self-made Pancake breakfast. It also became a grand hiker reunion, many of us looking for a clean, well-lighted place to get out of the rain. We chatted for hours. I was surprised to learn I had become somewhat a celeb, at least my tent had, for pictures of my tent had reached the hostel days before my arrival. People seemed genuinely excited to see in person the victim of the renegade bear. That night I managed to dry all my wet clothes, including my boots, which I stuffed with newspaper and placed on front of the fireplace. Tomorrow I would start fresh and we'll fed, with ambitions to reach Harper's Ferry.","Dicks Dome Hut

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566695,"I know it's an old tune, but the quality of sleep at the Bears Den Hostel was worse than lousy. I could not have been asleep more than a few minutes when I felt a hand on my leg. What's up, I mumbled. Roll over, someone said. I knew he was complaining about my snoring. I'm already on my stomach, I replied. In other words, it is what it is. But the damage was done. I could not fall back asleep, knowing full well that as soon as I did the walls would start rattling again.
On the positive side, I was the first one out of bed, the only one awake, drinking coffee and cooking pancakes when the sun's first rays came through the window. This fine breakfast, however, was not enough to dispel the fatigue-caused foul mood I was in. The foul mood morphed into a bout of self-pity. I hated every root, every rock, every fallen log blocking my path as I dragged my poles across the Loudoun Heights. My foul mood also led to some foul language, but if no one else is in the woods to hear it, is it really foul? I was ready to go to DC and fly home. I called Diane and vented. She talked me off the ledge. You need a break, she said. I sure did. Fortunately I had booked a night at the Econo Lodge. There I would snore as loudly and long as I pleased!","Bears Den Hostel

Later that afternoon, Diane arrived in town. She was in the neighborhood and thought she should drop in to see if I was still in a funk. We had dinner at the Anvil on Washington St. I had a blackened chicken penne that brought tears to my eyes. When no one was looking, I licked the bowl clean. 
We met Shop Teacher, Blue Steel, and Multi-tool at the restaurant. They had just come into town and we're staying at the Teahorse hostel. This being Memorial Day weekend, there was no room at the inns. I look forward to another zero tomorrow. The rest is doing me good.","Harper's Ferry

Surrounded on three sides by lofty heights, and at the confluence of two wide rivers, Harper's Ferry is certainly situated at a scenic spot. That it was fought over so frequently during the Civil War makes it all the more fascinating to me. This town may have become my favorite (or a close second to Damascus).
We ate lunch at Almost Heaven in lower Harper's Ferry, feasting on BBQ pulled pork and smoked turkey. Yes, it was almost heaven. 
Later that afternoon we drove one hour to REI in Fairfax, VA, to shop for new boots. I am retiring my Salomon boots after 1022 AT miles.

At 8 a.m. I went to the post office. To my relief, my new tent was there. This was the last item needing to be replaced on account of the bear.  My new Crocs are a lighter, sleeker model than the ones stolen.  For this I am grateful to the beast.
Diane drove me to the trailhead at 9 a.m., and left to return to MA.  The next time I will see her will likely be late June, when I expect to pass through my home state.  
Within minutes of being dropped off, upon crossing the Potomac River on the Byron Memorial Footbridge,  I was in Maryland, the 6th state that I've entered on this marathon walk in the woods.  This state greeted me kindly, starting with a couple of miles of a canal towpath.  It's flat and straight and parallels the Potomac River.  In general, the AT in Maryland is relatively easy, elevation-wise, but the ground can be rocky. Perhaps this is a precursor of PA.   
I set up my new tent at Dahlgren Campground and before I had even finished dinner, it rained.  It's officially christened now, and filthy with splashed mud.  And, yes, I have a new food handling process -- not a single morsel gets anywhere near the tent.  I check every pocket of my pack for energy bars and wrappers and remove my food bag and put all of it a good distance away from the tent before I unload the contents of the pack into the tent.  My respect for a bear's ability to pick up even the faintest of food odors has increased immensely.","Harper's Ferry

Actually, it's a rebuilt version of it, the original having been demolished over the course of time by vandals and what not.  It's made of stone and shaped like a milk can.  The site of the monument is on a hill overlooking a valley.  The Union used the location as a lookout post. Everywhere you turn in MD seems to have a Civil War story associated with it. I'm fascinated by this.I also took a longer side trip, 0.4 miles round trip, to Annapolis Rocks, which overlooks a long, green valley.  At one end of the valley is Hagerstown, also the scene of a significant Civil War event.  After the Confederates lost the battle in Gettysburg, General Lee's retreat passed through this town.Similar to yesterday, moments after I set up my tent and finished dinner, rain came down.  This eve, though, rolling and sharp crackling thunder accompanied the downpour.  Throughout the storm I reclined safe and snug and dry in my tent.

I made record time, mostly because the terrain was about as easy as any I've come across on the trail, miles upon miles of flat and down hill, and because the conditions were ideal, sunny and comfortably warm.  Along the way I passed the official halfway point, mile 1094.4, and then mile marker 1100 shortly thereafter. A small sign marked the midway mark. There is little point in making the sign more prominent since it moves every year, as the keepers of the AT add distance to the trail every year, often in the form of switchbacks. Along the way I also met Freckles,   who was hiking a short section.  She hiked the entire AT in 2014 with her friend, Drag 'n Fly, who was 74 at the time.  Drag 'n Fly set and still holds the record for the oldest woman to successfully thru-hike the AT. Meeting Freckles was fortuitous, as I will later relate.I arrived at the Pine Grove State Park at 2 p.m., to find Shop Teacher and Multi-tool.   Both had already successfully completed the half-gallon challenge in under 30 minutes.  It was a perfect day for ice cream, and I was famished.  I had no doubt I'd meet with success to.  Success eluded me.  A half-gallon was far more than I could stomach. I also made the tactical error of choosing Coconut Chocolate Almond. It tasted outstanding at first, but the richness of the flavor overwhelmed me.  Sadly, I tossed about a third of it in the trash - the first I can remember throwing away ice cream.Freckles lives in Gardner, PA,  about a 5 minute drive from the park.  In a strange coincidence, she had previously met Shop Teacher in Hot Springs. She and her husband, Rich (aka Hijack, because he was once forced to hike with Freckles), invited Shop Teacher, Multi-tool, and me to their home for the evening.  We quickly took them up on their offer.  I am always astounded by the generosity and hospitality I come across on the trail.At their beautiful home we showered, had our horrid clothes cleaned, and even wallowed in a hot tub.  I couldn't pull myself out until I was pink,  soft and wrinkled like a newborn babe.  My toes haven't been this clean since March 1st.Later I slept in a real bed in a separate bedroom allotted to me because I snore.  Ah, the perks that come with being a pariah. What a way to celebrate reaching the halfway mark.  The second half is showing signs of being better than the first.","Quarry Gap Shelter

We three hiked together, taking a short detour to eat lunch at the Green Mountain Store.  It was another ideal weather day.  The terrain was hillier than the day before.

In Duncannon, we found our primary objective, a breakfast joint called Goodies, closed because it was Monday.  Luckily, just then a woman came out of her home, situated next door to the restaurant,  and saw us standing there dejected.  I'd feed you breakfast, she said, but today is my daughter's graduation.  We thanked her just the same.  We asked her for recommendations of another breakfast place, and she referred us to Mutzabuagh, a grocery store about a mIle from where we stood. When we seemed ready to leave to walk there,  she said the road was too dangerous,  and that she would drive us.  What a wonderful offer, and we quickly seized upon it with feigned reluctance.  Her name is Flygirl, an airline assistant who experienced an on-the-job debilitating blast concussion from which she was slowly recovering.  An airline worker improperly closed the airplane door that created a boom knocking her unconscious. A passenger in the second row of the plane experienced ruptured ear drums.
At Mutzabuagh we resupplied and overloaded our packs with at least 3 days of food.  As usual, I overstocked.  Shop Teacher bought a graduation card for Flygirl's daughter, a very thoughtful gesture, and we all contributed a few dollars. Flygirl returned to the store to pick us up and drive us back down to town.  Shop Teacher gave her the card, and she beamed with appreciation. 
I went to the Post Office and picked up a postcard sent to me by Lex from the AMC.  The card was an encouragement, and I carrive it wit me.  
We three hikers had lunch at the Doyle, an old hotel that one time catered to the wealthy in the early 1900s, with a ballroom and bands, and now caters to hikers, and is running down.  Several other hikers poured in, including the Oklahoma girls and Kickstarter.  At one point we seriously considered staying the night there, but decided to speak first with trail angel Mary, to see what she had available.  Our understanding was that she had a donation-based or work-for-stay arrangement for putting up hikers.  
Though we made arrangements to stay at her hostel, we soon changed our minds because the forecasted rain never materialized. We decided to push on, but not before Multi-tool and Shop Teacher diagnosed an over-heating problem with her van, which she relied upon to shuttle hikers hither and thither.  They determined she had a blown head gasket.  She was crestfallen.  From the looks of her living quarters, we did not think she had two nickels to rub together.  We felt terribly for her and donated a little money towards the repair.
Multi-tool and i started hiking out of town, about one-half mile ahead of Shop Teacher. Just as we crossed the bridge over the Susquehanna, Shop Teacher phoned us to tell us to return to town because the Duncannon Assembly of God offered a free dinner and a free place to sleep.   We returned gladly.  It was late in the day, and the thought of stopping was overwhelmingly appealing.  I ate much pizza, drank 3 sodas, and ate pasta salad.  I took a shower and stayed the night in the church basement.  I found Already Stinky and Lucky Penny already in the basement, making for another happy reunion.","Cove Mtn Shelter

We are clearly reaching densely populated areas now that we're in the mid-Atlantic states.We arrived late to the William Penn Shelter, around 7:30 p.m, leaving about an hour to set up the tent, eat, get water, and bear bag before darkness fell.

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568737,"Shop Teacher, Multi-tool, and I walked 19.2 miles today to Eagles Nest shelter and found nary an eagle or a nest.  How shelters get their names might make for an intriguing topic of independent study.  But that's for post-trail activities. Hiking 8 to 12 hours per day leaves little time for research.
On the way to the shelter, I passed the mark of having less than 1000 miles remaining to finish.  Shortly thereafter I passed the 1200 miles traveled mark. Though I know I'm making progress, these numbers still mean there are still many miles to go before I sleep.
My backpack doesn't fit as well as it once did.  I've cinched the waist strap as tightly as possible, but the belt is still slightly loose, which means my hips don't bear as much weight as they should.  This puts more strain on the shoulders because they bear weight not carried by the hips.  After ten hours of this, they are sore.  But I hardly notice because my feet are more sore, and my simple brain can concentrate on only one pain at a time, usually the one that hurts most.
At the shelter I spoke with my sister, Lynne, to wish her a happy birthday, my wife Diane, my daughter Lauren, and my son Matt. Having cell service has restored my connection to the civilized world.  I find solace in this. 
The path today was generally flat.  Southern PA has been kind.  But it is getting rockier and rockier.  I've stubbed many a toe, turned many an ankle (just two, actually), and stumbled innumerable times, my poles saving me on those occasions.  Naturally the rocks slow my progress.  I've learned, however, that you take what the trail gives you; there's no point in complaining; but I don't let that stop me.
I'm camping tonight again with Shop Teacher and Multi-tool.  Lucky Penny and Already Stinky came to the shelter late, near sunset. We talked of today's exploits.  These evening reunions at a shelter are often a highlight to the day.  One never knows who might turn up.","William Penn Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568744,"Stopping at Eagles Nest yesterday left a short hike into town today. There are two prevailing strategies for entering town: 1) lay up short before the town, leaving a nero for the next day, which leaves enough time to do all the chores, stay overnight and then leave early the next day; and 2) hike almost a full day into evening just to get into town, stay overnight, then do all the chores the next day, going immediately back to the trail when the chores are done. Shop Teacher, Multi-tool, and I followed the first strategy.  Multi-tool outstripped us because he was planning to meet his sister and her fiancé in town.
At 11 a.m., Shop Teacher and I crossed the Port Clinton railway station and walked through town - all of it, it's not that big - and went directly to the Port Clinton Hotel.  Shop Teacher and I intended to share a room to split costs, but the hotel had single bed rooms only. We're fast becoming friends, but that's a little too fast. So we got our own rooms. 
At the hotel we came upon Multi-tool, already sipping a brew in the hotel's Pub, Tugboat, and Hoochiemama.  I had not seen the latter two since Gravel Springs Hut during the infamous bear crisis on May 22. Moments later Multi-tool's sister and her fiancé came in to pick him up. We bade him farewell for the time being.
Shop Teacher and I ate lunch in the Pub, which entailed a massive steak and cheese sub with fries, walked to the barbershop, spoke with Frank the barbershop owner, who welcomes hikers with open arms, coffee and cookies, and walked to the pavilion at the far end of town.  Hikers staying in Port Clinton are free to stay there.  As we approached it, I saw a squirrel scampering away.  It had ransacked a brown paper bag filled with shelled peanuts. Apparently I had interrupted a feast fit for a king squirrel. Water near the pavilion is deemed contaminated, so hikers were advised to avoid it.
Later I dove headlong into a pasta dinner in the Hotel restaurant.  The Hotel, it seems, is the only game in town, and hikers are a large part of its clientele. 
Back in my room I watched Saving Private Ryan for the eleventh time long, too long, into the night.","Eagles Nest Shelter

It was a blast. Then I watched Hacksaw Ridge long, too long, into the night.","Port Clinton

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568757,"Matt went off to early church service, while his Pops slept off a late movie night.  While he was out, I tried to catch up on my trail journal, a hopeless task since I am typically seven days or more behind when I have cell service, time, and I'm not too tired. Uploading photos alone is onerous. When I'm in town I prefer a little TV over typing into my phone. I think I managed to catch up just three days. Nonetheless,  I consider it an important duty.  Some day this hike will be over and my ""real time"" notes will be precious to me.  Besides, I know some family members use it to determine whether I am still alive and have not become bear food.
Matt got us back to the Port Clinton trailhead at 1 pm.  We had an ambitious hike ahead of us, fifteen miles to Eckville Shelter. No problem, he assured me, for he was in the best shape of his life. But hiking uses different muscles.  And it takes at least three days for the youngsters to get theirs, and three weeks for us older folks.  To his credit, he slogged over and down hills and dales, albeit with rubbery legs, to reach the shelter by 8 pm.  We set up camp, he in an open field and I on a raised tent platform, and cooked dinner, though he did not have much of an appetite (he did have some of my packaged tuna fish,  which he found delectable).  I left the fly off my tent so I could observe the stars at night. This sounds like fun, but I need to sleep on my back to appreciate the view, and wear my glasses, two things I don't do. But I still like to say I did it.          
We also bear bagged.  It had gotten dark so we bumbled through the dark forest looking for just the right tree, never a simple task in the light of day. The ideal tree has a horizontal limb about 12 or more feet above the ground that reaches at least six feet away from the trunk. My tosses of the rope over an ideal branch failed, so i gave Matt a go. His first toss was a winner, beginners luck, and we were ready to go. The night was warm, and fireflies momentarily appeared and disappeared into the dark.","Port Clinton

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568760,"After a sumptuous breakfast consisting of two Nature Valley granola bars, a Clif bar, and Gatorade, Matt and I set off from the shelter on our second day of hiking. Today's hike was less ambitious.  I had arranged for a shuttle to pick him up at PA309, only 11 miles away, to drive him back to Port Clinton, where he had parked his car. He was astonished at how well his legs recovered from the night before. They were not quite 100 percent, but they were refreshed.  The recovery, however, was short lived. Eleven miles is a long hike for someone still waiting for their trail legs to kick in.  He was elated to reach the rendezvous point, knowing his misery would soon be over.  The shuttle driver was punctual.  I bid Matt a fond farewell.  The three days with him were among the most enjoyable of this odyssey. After he left, I trudged for six more miles to Bake Oven Knob shelter, appropriately named as temperatures were adequate for baking cakes and bodies.  
Matt's departure was opportune for him, as these six miles crossed rocky, strenuous terrain, including Knifes Edge and Bear Rocks. To climb these bare rock structures required climbing, careful navigation, patience, and balance. They got my heart pumping and adrenaline flowing.  Over the course of a long day, it's these challenging segments that I remember most and talk about with fellow hikers.","Eckville Shelter

In my tent I was the oven stuffer roaster.My initial plans were to hike 23 miles to Leroy Smith shelter, but the climb out of Lehigh Gap was astounding.  All boulders, piled a mile high, greeted me once I crossed the Lehigh River.  Hand over hand scrambles had me clinging to the boulders, knowing full well a fall would have hurtful consequences.  My pack was no help, because it tended to pull me backwards, not a pleasant feeling when the path in front of you is mostly vertical. My poles were useless, too. Temps hit the mid 90s, and there was no shade on those rocks.  My entire body dripped sweat.
I drank some of my water at the top of the climb, though i knew the next refill opportunity was 10 miles away.  I would have to make my remainig liter last.It didn't. It was so hot I ran out of water four miles before I could reach Delps Spring, identified in the guidebook as an unreliable source located 0.4 miles down a steep rocky path.  It mattered not to me.  I needed water badly and figured the wet season thus far would bode well for the chance of water, even at an unreliable spring. Anxiously I descended the slope, hoping I was not walking 0.8 miles roundtrip in vain.  
Eureka, there was water, lots of it, cold and refreshing.  I filled up my water bottles, slugged about a liter, but I was done hiking for the day.  Hopefully, tomorrow won't be as hot.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

I was packed and ready to hike by 7 a.m.  My day's objective was Kirkridge shelter, just shy of 20 miles. The terrain was relatively flat so I was confident I could get it done by 5 p.m.
I'd not gotten more than a tenth of a mile when I came upon a whitetail.  It ran immediately into the thick brush beyond my sight. Then came one of the strangest sounds I've yet to hear any where, let alone in the woods.  From where the deer vanished I heard a loud bleating, like a dry cough.  I could only imagine the cry came from the deer, but I did not know they uttered any sounds. They always struck me as the strong, silent type.
My pace today was slower than usual on account of the ground being so rocky.  I measured every step and could maintain a constant gait.  My ankles twisted, my toes pinched, and the heels of my boots rubbed against my raw blisters. Notwithstanding, I make progress and started entertaining the thought of going all the way to the town of Delaware Water Gap.  It is near the PA-NJ border, and now I wanted desperately to leave this state.  My boots, my toes could stand no more.
Today I took better care to hydrate.  I stopped at the Leroy A. Smith shelter, just 6 miles from my starting point, to fully load up on water.  As usual in PA, the water is 0.4 miles away the shelter, down a steep rocky path, but it's worth the 0.8 mile roundtrip. I also feast on  a Ramen noodle and tuna brunch. Another hiker, Echo, is there to keep good company.
The food and water energize me, and I march through the forests like a man possessed.  Wolf Rocks, a line of boulders along a ridge, provide an uphill challenge, another rock to bolder jumping exercise.  This never fails to exhilarate.
At 5 p.m., I power past the Kirkridge shelter, fully committed to make it to all the way to town.  I arrive at 7:30 p.m., gratified, and find Echo and Don Gauntlet, the trail angel, sitting at a picnic table in front of the Church of the Mountain hostel.  Don has food and drinks.  I slam down a cold Ginger ale, three applesauce cups, a banana, five tangerines, gobs of chocolate, and handfuls of pepperoni, mumbling my gratitude between chews.  I made a pig of myself, and Don seemed utterly delighted by it.

He offered me water that day, which I gratefully declined; he was going to need every drop.After breakfast I visited the Edge of the woods outfitter to have my pole tips replaced.  During my climb out of Lehigh Gap, the metal tips of both poles broke, more specifically, were driven up into the hollow of the poles as a result of my pounding them frequently into rock. The young man who repaired them also fixed a pair of levers, which had broken or was about to break.  My poles are as good as new.
My next task was to do laundry - the last four days of heat and sweat rendered them horrid.  The church has two buckets, which I used to hand wash and rinse my pants, shirt, and soiled unmentionables.  It's tough to get filthy clothes fully clean by just wringing them in cold water, but it's a marked improvement.  Besides, by this time tomorrow they will be Stinky again.

We headed out of PA about 9 a.m., joined by a fellow hiker named Kickstand, who had a prosthetic lower leg.  While most hikers were whining about how the rocks of PA were destroying their feet, he complained of how they mauled his stump.  To leave PA and enter NJ we crossed the Delaware River Bridge.  Eighteen wheelers roared by at breakneck speed mere feet away, separated from us by a puny three-feet high cement barrier. A sidewalk painting noted the moment of our crossing.  So did the several dead fish in the river below and an odor of rotting trash (not kidding).We climbed out of the Gap into the New Jersey highlands.

I'm okay, I assured her, but I was having trouble pushing the protruding bone back under the skin.  Later I sent her a photo of my elbow to prove that I had no protruding bones. It doesn't even need a bandaid, she said.  My ego wilted under her scorn.For the remainder of our hike, I approached all wet rocks suspiciously, and still fell yet again, this time on my rump.  Yet another time I spun 180 degrees, dropped my pole, and put my hands on the ground to remain upright. Since it would not have qualified as a legitimate football tackle, I don't count it as a fall.In the afternoon we stopped at Gyp Tavern, where I devoured a bacon cheeseburger, sweet potato fries, an ice cream sandwich, and a root beer. The tavern abuts a pond and has outdoor tables and a marvelous view, yet we ate inside so that we could recharge our phones.

Then they invited us (which included Daddy Long Legs) to share their food, an offer they did not need to make twice.  I had shrimp, a roast beef sandwich, mixed nuts, ice tea.  Then they played more music, taking requests.  We sang along with them. It was getting late, we had enjoyed their company (and their food) far too long and had to resume our hike, lest we hike in the dark, so we bid them farewell.  We reached our shelter an hour before sunset, enjoyed a snack, and told ghost stories.

My clutching a handle on the back of the front seat helped me keep myself upright.  What was the driver's rush?  I, in turn, kissed the ground after I exited the car, but in my haste to evacuate, I left my water bottle in the van.  Unknowingly, I climbed Wawayanda mountain, a 900 foot ascent called ""the stairway to heaven"", without any water.  I became immediately knowing once I reached the top and for my bottle in a side pocket of my pack, only to discover it missing.

Bear Mt. bustled with day hikers and bikers, several of which wanted their photos taken with Shop Teacher, as if he were a celebrity figure, just because he was thru-hiking. As we climbed, we enjoyed views of the Hudson. You could even see the New York City skyline, over 30 miles away. 
The zoo was lame.  Most of the animals could not be seen, perhaps inside escaping from the heat or perhaps having escaped their cages. The bear den was at the lowest elevation on the AT, a mere 120 feet above sea level. This is appropriate because it was a low point of the hike.  The two penned bears looked miserable, one of them hobbling as though it had a broken back, the other walking listlessly.  Dozens of turkey vultures filled their pen, as though waiting for them to die.  I couldn't help make the contrast between them and the three bears I saw earlier that morning in the woods, bears that were active, healthy, and free.Early in the morning we crossed the Palisades Parkway at 8 a.m., rush hour. It was insane.  Cars flashed by at well over 60 miles an hour.  Crossing was more dangerous than meeting 3 bears in the woods.  Something needs to be done to improve hiker safety at this crossing before someone gets killed.

Tomorrow I will have an even shorter day, as I plan to meet my sister, Michele, and my mother at a parking lot alongside the trail.  They will drive me to mom's place near Poughkeepsie for a day of good eats and good company.","Clarence fahnestock state park

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569985,"Going to Pleasant Valley to visit mom today.  My sister, Michele, is picking me up at the Nuclear Lake Municipal Parking Lot at 9 a.m., a mere 3.4 miles from last night's campsite at Morgan Stewart Shelter. The day is sunny, warm. A few thin wisps float by overhead.      
I arrived at the lot early, at 8:30 a.m.  I tried to text Michele that I have arrived, but,  lo, I have no cell service here.  AT&T knows when I need service most and manages to fail me at those critical moments.  One of my first acts when this journey is over will be to find a different service provider. 
Michele and mom pulled in at 9 a.m. on the nose. They had brought Dunkin Donuts coffee and an egg sandwich for me. They also had a box of donuts.  I wept tears of joy, eating the entire drive back to mom's house. Michele could not resist telling me I looked emaciated and stunk to high heaven. Mom said she would not have recognized me if not for the photos on my journal. Family can be so blunt.  On the bright side, Mom said she could not smell a thing, but I noticed her car window was open. 
In the afternoon, I did a small resupply and saw Michele's new apartment (it's perfect for her) on our way to picking up my son, Dan, and his fiancé Julie from the train station. The couple made a herculean effort to see me and mom, travelling well over 2 hours by trains to get into town. Their faces still glowed from their recent engagement announcement.  I can't begin to describe how wonderful it was to see them.  
Later that evening we all four feasted on Chinese food and ate apple pie. All this normal food is creating great gastric distress. Give me a good old Clif bar over a plate of General Tso chicken any day.  Needless to say I was hungry again about an hour later, but that is typical for me after eating Chinese food, and is unrelated to hiker hunger.
After dinner, we had a harrowing ride back to the train station.  We cut it too close, timewise, but they made the return train with four minutes to spare. Tomorrow I return to the trail, but not before a decent breakfast!","Morgan Stewart Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570628,"I slept last night comfortably, with an overhead fan turning slowly over my bed, a window opened slightly allowing for a cool breeze, and an overwhelming skunk smell wafting in, so strongly i expected to find it at the foot of my bed. But I've learned from the trail to get used to bad odors, particularly my own, and soon I no longer noticed the stank of the skunk.
Mom, Michele, and I had a scrumptious breakfast at the Village Restaurant in Pleasant Valley. We feasted leisurely, this meal being a memorable highlight of my adventures that I did not wish to rush. They brought me to the trailhead shortly before 11 am. Parting was such sweet sorrow.
Hiking conditions were nigh perfect, sunny, warm in the 60s, a slight breeze, and friendly terrain, mostly flat and smooth. New York came in like a lion and out like a lamb. I crossed into Connecticut around 6 p.m. and reached my destination, the 10 Mile River Shelter, at 7:30 p.m. My tent sat in a campsite near the junction of two rivers, the 10 Mile River and the Housatonic River. So did the tents of about twenty 12-year old boys, who were out on a youth group trip. They were energetic and charged with adventure. I vaguely recalled being that young once, and I fully understood their excitement; here they were, away from home, camping and joking with their best buds! At 10 p.m., they were still going strong, their voices and laughter filling the woods. Some tried to talk in muffled tones, but sound carries far at night. Even whispers I could clearly hear. There's no telling how late they stayed awake because exhaustion caught up to me and knocked me unconscious despite the clamour.
Earlier in the day I had eaten at Roseann's kitchen, a food truck that served burgers and milkshakes just two tenths of a mile from the Appalachian Trail RR station. A laminated flyer on the boardwalk leading to the station had alerted me to its existence, demonstrating the power of a well placed advertisement. Later that afternoon, I had also enjoyed trail magic at the Wiley Shelter, courtesy of Captain Jack's aunt and uncle. I mooched a coke, root beer, and about a half pound of watermelon. I have become an unabashed partaker of trail magic, which has abounded in the mid-Atlantic states. The downside of trail magic, if there can be such a thing, is that I don't eat much of the food I am carrying. In other words, I am carrying extra weight unnecessarily, a hiking no-no. Notwithstanding, I cannot resist the instant gratification brought about by treats I can't ordinarily carry with me, so extra weight be damned.","

I checked the time on my phone : 6:45 a.m. I was surprised; I couldn't recall the last time I'd slept that late. Perhaps the soothing sound of the nearby Housatonic had hypnotized me. I broke camp with a sense of urgency; I did not want to get caught behind a group of twenty hikers, which I could hear stirring. Soon they began pouring out of their tents like bees from their hives. Fortunately I was more focused then they were. Most milled about aimlessly until told directly what to do by their counselor. I did not envy his job.
As I departed, I heard behind me a chorus of goodbyes. I turned about to find almost all of them standing together waving goodbye to me. I laughed aloud and waved farewell in return. My smile did not dim as I crossed over the 10 Mile River Bridge and started the day's trek.
The trail today crossed back into NY and then in two short miles back into CT. Rumors had it that CT was ""nice."" Nice it was, but not easy. It had so many ups and downs, the cumulative effect was wearing. Also, the descent from Calebs Peak was downright harrowing, a long, steep descent on stone steps down to the Housatonic river. I came down at a snail's pace, being careful of each footing before taking the next step. The trail is not without its perils. I considered how lucky I was that the stones were dry; rain threatened throughout the day, and there was occasional thunder, but no precipitation.
In the late afternoon the trail became a hiker's delight, effectively flat and parallel to the gently flowing Housatonic. Connecticut was a friend indeed. Then, as I've experienced all too frequently, I hit a steep incline on the day's final leg to reach the Silver Hill Campsite.
The campsite was impressive. It had many flat spaces ideal for a tent, a pavilion with a picnic table, a privy, a deck with bench seats along two sides, a bench swing, and pump. Cell service was best near the swing, so I did my texting as I swung gently back and forth. One of the other hikers pumped madly at the well. The guidebook indicated that it would take between 35 and 40 pumps to raise water, a bit of a deterrent to someone whose trailname translates to ""the lazy man."" When water gushed forth, several of us ran over with our water bottles to capitalize on his labor. Apparently I was not the only lazy man present.","

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570667,"Who needs an alarm clock when there is an abundance of woodpeckers and songbirds about?  At 5:45 a.m., the birds made sure I was fully awake; two hours later, I was retracing last night's steps into the shelter, this time up the steep rocky steps, but at least in daylight.  Again, the weather was accommodating. 
These days I find it hard to pass by a town that is anywhere near the trail.  Salisbury, CT, is one such town, a quaint, well-to-do town, with a fine-looking town hall and far more eating opportunities than Falls Village.  It was still early morn when I took a 0.8 mile detour to have coffee and pastries at the Country Bistro.  To mask my hiker funk while in the shop, I put my raincoat over my sweaty shirt -- it had been 3 days since my last shower and laundry.  I am very self-conscious about my not-so-pleasant odor when I go to public places, so I picked a table in the corner of the diner, far from the other patrons, and close to an electric socket for charging my phone.  Golden oldies played over the sound system.  With close attention I could hear the lyrics ""Don't let the sun go down on me.""  Three cups of coffee, two pastries, a full phone recharge, and two hours later, I was headed back to the trail, truly a sated hiker.  
Two milestones came today: 1) I passed the 1500 mile mark; and 2) I entered Massachusetts, my home state, the 10th state of this odyssey.  Both facts boggle my mind.  However, it was not easy accomplishing these milestones today.  For one, Connecticut finished with a bang.  Though it had turned into a somewhat subdued hike, mostly flat of late, the state required a steep ascent of Bear Mountain (I think every state has a mountain by this name) and an even steeper descent before I could leave it.  Bear Mountain is the only mountain in Connecticut on the AT above 2000', coming in at 2316'.  Atop Bear Mountain is a rock observation tower that provides an outstanding view and an excuse for taking a long break.  
Further, Massachusetts started with two significant challenges, Mt. Race at 2365' and Mt. Everett at 2602'.  Now while the mountains of the South dwarf these mountains, it has been quite some time since I've been above 2000'.  I hate to say it, but I may have become a little soft, pampered by the lower elevations of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and lastly Connecticut.  Massachusetts has come at the right time to whip me back into shape for the greater challenges and higher elevations of Vermont, New Hampshire, and, ultimately, Maine.
The climb of Mt. Race was a rocky one, long, relentless.  The trail skirted ledges with sheer drop offs that gave outstanding vistas but also vertigo.  I stood as far away from the edge as the trail would allow.  Admittedly, I felt a sense of relief when the white blazes led me away from the cliff edge back among the trees.  Mt. Everett was also rocky, but not as troublesome to descend.  Coming at the end of my hiking day, these mountains took what energy I had left in me.  My spirits lifted, though, when I reached Glen Brook Shelter and found Shop Teacher.  He and I are heading to Westborough, MA, tomorrow for some much needed rest.","Limestone Spring Shelter

At the shelter were members of Camp Becket, including three counselors and eight twelve year old, out on a two-day hike.

Today was one of them.  Shortly after a breakfast of pancakes and coffee, Shop Teacher and I came upon coolers in the woods containing sodas, Gatorades, water, and beer, a common thru-hiker staple. I drank a Gatorade and filled my water bottle with another.  Around lunchtime we dropped in on the famous ""Cookie Lady"", who lives on Washington Mt. Rd, near Becket, MA. She gives free cookies to hikers who ask, like me.  I bought hard two boiled eggs, soda, and a Klondike from her, and a dozen of us enjoyed a relaxing lunch on her lawn.  We hikers are akin to nomads, moving from oasis to oasis to eat, drink, replenish resources, exchange news about the trail, and inform each other of the next good place to visit. Word had it, the next good place was just around the corner.That corner was three miles later, where we came upon Rob's Friendly van and wallowed in more soda and snacks.

Our hearts skipped a beat.  Pretty steep, I thought.  I'll have a banana instead.

Greylock, the highest mountain in MA. Shop Teacher reserved for us bunks in the Bascom Lodge atop the peak. The first half of our 17-mile hike brought us into the town of Dalton, MA.  Picnic tables aside Diane's Twist, an ice cream and sandwich shop, served as a fine resting place.  We supplemented our pack lunches of peanut butter and crackers with ice cream and pasta from the store. Food you would not normally mix in a single meal have become the norm for me.Lunch ended late in the afternoon, so we wondered about our chances of reaching Mt. Greylock before nightfall.

At the car were two young hikers (brothers ""OK"" and ""Chugga"") and two young women, who were assisting the first who beckoned us.  Indubitably, the charm of the young ladies had captured the attention of the young men. A table lay spread full of sandwiches, pasta, pastries, hummus, and chips, and coolers full of beer, sodas, tea, juices, powerade, and water. Though still full from lunch, I managed to avail myself of their generosity. Shop Teacher and I grazed long enough for several other hikers to join our gathering, also young men, drawn by the alure of the trail angels.  Some made the grevious error of grabbing a beer and settling into a lounge chair set up on the side of the road.  Soon the one beer became a second and then a third. Their resolve to continue hiking ebbed like a receding tide. Keen to the trap, Shop Teacher and I left for Mt. Greylock. We both hazarded a guess that we would not see any of these hikers again that evening. We were correct.Though long, the hike up was not difficult.  Atop Mt. Greylock, we checked into the Lodge and moved into our bunks.  Showers were available and immediately used - typically my first act is to get out of my filthy clothes, saturated in sweat, and put on my camp clothes.  We afterwards cooked our dinner in front of the Lodge on a picnic table in a blustery wind, not a simple task with the flames of our stove frequently blowing out. And it was suprisingly chilly, giving me a foretaste of what awaits us in VT, NH, and ME.After we managed dinner, we visited the War Monument at the summit, dedicated to the men and women of WWI who perished in the Great War.

This was not the kind of trail magic to which we had grown accustomed. Then a male hiker came in.  He was completely naked, and I was afraid.  I could not look either of them in the eye (or anywhere else, for that matter, in case you're wondering).
Is this hike naked day? Did we not get the memo? Shop Teacher figured they did not want to get their clothes wet. I chalked it up to this being Vermont, the land of nudist colonies. The couple chatted with us as though nothing was out of the ordinary. They clearly were comfortable in their own skin. So, we, too, acted as though nothing unusual was happening. We would show them that we were comfortable in our own clothes.  But, in truth, it was awkward.

Because there are many new hikers on the trail (they are hiking the Long Trail, which extends from the MA border to Canada and shares the same path as the AT through So.

Admittedly, I'm not in this camp. Though there are still many breathtaking mountains to climb, streams to cross, and towns to visit, part of me is looking forward to returning home. I think it's the El Vago nature in me that longs for the creature comforts and the lazy mornings. This has been a long, very long strange trip, and one-quarter of it has yet to be traveled.  So close, and yet so far. But I'm in it for the duration. Shop Teacher and I are still racking up the miles together.  We did a near 20 miler today. After a foggy start, it turned into a gorgeous day for hiking, and since the forecast for tomorrow is none too good, we decided to make hay while the sun shined.  The morning saw us climb Bromley Mt., where we found a ski lift chair to relax upon. The big challenge for today was Baker Peak, a rocky climb along a steep ridge, a rarity for the trail in VT.  For the most part, VT has been a long, muddy, green tunnel.","VT Rtes 11 & 40

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572091,"I awoke to the sound of rain pounding on the tent. It was 5 am., scarcely light. I had a decent, refreshing night of sleep, but I couldn't imagine breaking camp in the middle of this deluge.  I waited a while in my bag for the rain to subside. When it did, I hurried to pack in a light drizzle.  The entire campground of about ten of us huddles in the shelter because it has covered benches and a picnic table.   Everyone is wearing rain gear.  One couple complains about water in their tent.  You can sense everyone's reluctance to begin hiking. We eat breakfast slowly.  Yet, the rain falls harder, as if to spite us. And the weather forecast is discouraging. A first brave soul ventures out, then another.  Eventually Shop Teacher and I leave the relative comfort of the shelter, covered in raincoats and rain kilts. We move cautiously, every rock and root slick as ice. Mud abounds. Countless times I slip, but catch myself from falling. We are satisfied to reach Clarendon Shelter, though it's only 14 miles for the day.  Progress slows down considerably when everything is wet. You also feel chilled when all of your clothing is soaked through. Granted, it's not hypothermia conditions, but you can get cold in a light drizzle and a breeze.We climbed another Bear Mt. Every state must have one by this name.  Unlike those in NY and CT, VT's Bear Mt. had nothing particularly noteworthy at its summit, not a tower, not a monument, not even a view. Vermont is not quite winning me over.  One person said it's his favorite state.  Another said it started off crummy but became a surprise enjoyment.  For me it's been mud, rain, and a green tunnel, meaning, the path cuts through the trees and gives few views from the mountain tops. At the end of the day, it's quite pleasurable changing into dry clothes and crawling into a warm sleeping bag.  Putting on those soaked clothes for tomorrow's hike is tomorrow guy's problem. For now, it's a well deserved rest in my simple creature comforts.","Little Rock Pond Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572095,"Killington, a 4000 footer, came between us and an overnighter at the Inn at Long Trail.  It is perhaps the most famous of Vermont's peaks, having a top notch ski resort and slopes. We had to climb over 2000 feet to reach the summit.  The last 0.2 miles was a hand over hand rock scramble.  It was exhilarating.  It mattered not that the mountaintop was cloaked in clouds.  The air was cool, and we had accomplished something great.
We passed the 500 miles to Katahdin marker, a sign nailed to a tree commemorating the achievement, and later passed the 1700 miles traveled milestone. Slowly but surely the miles add up though each individual day's contribution may be small.  I can't wrap my head around it.  Northstar, a 2016 thru-hiker whose acquaintance we made in Rangeley about a year ago, drove an hour from his home to meet us at VT Rte 4 and take us to Rutland to eat and resupply.  For this i am most grateful.  It was a pleasure seeing him again.  He spoke fondly of the trail and said he misses it. I hope to soon reach that point where I, too, can look back at the trail and say I miss it.Tonight we sleep at the Inn.  Presently it's raining, but it's warm and dry inside, making me realize we took a break from the trail at just the right time.","Clarendon Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572212,"The Inn fed us breakfast that excelled in quality and quantity. Several cups of coffee later, I sat about the lounge to call Diane and catch up on my journal. Turned out neither Shop Teacher nor I was in any particular rush. Such is the power of a big meal and easy chairs. It was close to half past eleven when we reached the trailhead. I couldn't help notice skies looked ominous as we entered the woods. 
We had a fairly uneventful start, the usual rocks and roots and plants and things. A minor milestone was reaching Maine Junction where the Long Trail and AT split off from each other. The Long Trail continues north to Canada, while the AT turns east towards NH.
 As we approached Gifford State Park the skies let loose a deluge. My clothing was drenched in minutes, a mere half day after I laundered it.  But I have grown accustomed to wearing wet clothing; such is the trail life. However, I have yet to get used to putting on wet clothing in the morning.  Instantly you feel clammy.  But, once again, that's tomorrow guy's problem. 
To escape the downpour, we took cover under a kitchen tent in a campsite, and sat out the storm for 20 minutes.  At first we thought it was a campground shelter, but it turned out to be someone's campsite.  Fortunately, the residents were not there and did not return while we squatted under their tent.  In short order the rain stopped and the sun reappeared.
Later we climbed Quimby Mt., which was a strenuous, a 1200 foot rise in 1.3 miles. Shades of things to come.
After we reached the shelter, we cooked dinner and contemplated pushing on, particulary because a rogue bear had visited this shelter for the past three days. But then it started raining hard again. Daddy Long Legs pulled into camp, and set up his tent in the rain.  I waited for the rain to let up and did the same.  Bear bags were hung with great care.","VT Rt 4

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572215,"From the onset, our intention was to go to the On The Edge Farm for some homemade pie, ice cream, and drinks.  We did not plan to stop for the night.  But we did.  Hiking weather was ideal, the sky blue, with an occasional white puffy cloud floating lazily by, and a nice warm temperature.  As we approached the store, we found Daddy Long Legs was already sitting by a picnic table. He got trapped by the idyllic scene of delicious treats on a nice sunny day.  We were soon trapped, too.
Just down the road from the store is a hostel where Mr. Quinn allows hikers to camp in his yard.  The grass is green, flat, and soft to walk upon. I set up my tent near a creek. The white noise should help drown out the sound of passing traffic (we are on VT 12). Shop Teacher and Daddy Long legs also set up in the yard.
The Northern Lights are supposed to be visible tonight.  It's an additional excuse to stop; Mr. Quinn's yard has a good view of the northern sky.  Now, if only the low lying clouds would go away.
Lastly, before we reached VT 12, we stopped at the Lookout, a privately owned shelter made available to hikers.  It has a 20 foot ladder leading to a deck built upon a roof. From that vantage point you can see for miles, even to the Whites.  It was intimidating to climb up to the deck, but it was well worth it. The view was breathtaking; one could see for 60, 70, 80 miles.  I couldn't tell what that HUGE mountain was in the distance. I hope we don't climb it. Mt. Washington perhaps?","Stony Brook Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572330,"So much happens in a single day on the trail, I can't capture all of it in a blog entry.  At best, I focus on highlights. The play of the day goes out to my friend, Foghat, who waited at mile marker 1738.8 to greet me and bestow gifts of drink and snacks. He's been supporting me with text messages throughout the trek, but I didn't expect him to hand carry his well wishes to me personally.   I cannot adequately thank him for such encouragement.  I wish I could have spent more time chatting with him, but we were trying to outrun a thunderstorm that had been chasing us throughout the afternoon. Soon after we went our separate ways, having gotten no further than the bridge over the White River, the very same bridge from which hikers regularly jump 25 feet into the waters below, the thunderstorm caught up with us.  At that moment we spied Daddy Long Legs at a hostel across the street, run by Linda and Randy.  In his rather persuasive manner, he convinced Shop Teacher and I to stop for the day.  His most effective argument was that Linda had just brewed a pot of coffee. Sold! She also cooked us burgers on the grill and provided soda. The kindness and generosity of people on the trail continue to boggle me.  It's followed me from GA to VT, selfless altruism. On a lighter note, I dropped my bandana into Pomfret Brook this morning. The brook was flowing strongly, and the bandana got trapped under the water by the flow's force.  I balanced myself precariously on rocks and reached for it with my poles, but I could not free it. Then I slipped, and both feet went into the stream up to the ankles, above the boot line.  My feet were drenched.  I abandoned the bandana, aggravated that I would have to hike the entire day in soggy shoes. Someday, when the water level drops, someone will find my bandana, I tell Shop.  Yes, he replies, and then they will dredge the entire stream looking for the rest of the hiker.","VT 12

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572756,"We vacated the blue house early, shortly after seven.  The rainy skies had cleared overnight.  Our magnificent hosts left a pot of coffee and muffins for us on their porch.  I don't ever want to take for granted such generosity, and yet on the trail it's become so commonplace, the number of selfless people you run into.  
Case in point: from a published list of trail angels who live near or in Hanover and who were willing to house hikers for a night, we chose Warren Thayer because his home lay right on the trail. As soon as you pop out of the woods, you are on Elm Street, and his house is the first one you come to.  Can't miss it. He keeps a blue cooler filled with soft drinks at the bottom of his driveway. Yesterday we called ahead to ""reserve"" our spots - he advertised that he had enough room for three or four hikers. 
The morning hike to Elm St. was a short one, just over 7 miles, so we arrived before noon.  Warren greeted us warmly and then apologetically said he did not have space for us in his hiker room.  A group of five SOBOS had stayed the night before and had asked if they could zero today.  Having a generous heart towards hikers, Warren granted them their wish.  Shop and I were welcome to stay, but the only remaining available space was in the garage. We took it. 
After we washed - often our first act upon reaching civilization - Warren drove us all about, to New Lebanon so I could buy new boots at EMS, to Hanover for resupply, and to Norwich for lunch. So unofficially we've made it to NH, but the official crossing over won't occur until tomorrow. That evening we met Warren's wife Toni, and the four of feasted at a Mexican restaurant. Toni is a hospice nurse, and gave us useful information about the symptoms of Lyme disease, a topic that comes up frequently among hikers.  We all have met someone on the trail who has been afflicted by it.  Easily treatable if caught early. Warren is in the publishing business and publishes a magazine about food. Gracious hosts, the two of them, for whom I am grateful.","West Hartford

Fueled by the caffeine, we strolled into Hanover, the home of Dartmouth, to find it bustling with pedestrians and auto traffic. The trail passed by bookstores, clothing shops, the Dartmouth Green, and several dining establishments.  We stopped at Lou's Bakery to get our free pastry, given to all thru-hikers, and another cup of coffee. We took care to keep our hands over our cups lest a passerby drop in a coin to help out the old homeless men. The free cruller was a brilliant marketing move, because we craved more and entered the diner for a full breakfast.  A full belly and a warm sun are not conducive to hiking.  While Shop Teacher moved in and out of sidewalk stores, I sat soporific on a park bench, eyes closed, the sun warming my face.  I may have snoozed.  Then we shopped at a Co-op for drinks and snacks. It was near 11 a.m. before we finally returned to the woods. We could have easily zeroed in this town. Was I subconsciously resisting the inevitable? The White Mountains are coming! The White Mountains are coming!  It is said that by the time a thru-hiker has reached the Whites, he has covered 80% of the distance but done only 20% of the work.  Well, the road to Katahdin passes through the Whites.  It's nigh time to get it done.","Norwich, VT

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572936,"A member of our trail family, Daddy Long legs, reports he has fractured his tibia and is off the trail. It's disheartening to hear, especially because he was so close.  He is experiencing what everyone fears at this late stage, a mishap that prevents you from reaching that long sought for, that long fought for goal. My heart goes out to him. We shared many a mile and experiences.  I will miss him.                 With a pensive heart, I trudged through the woods.  I could tell Shop Teacher was also thinking about the quirks of the trail.  We moved on in silence for some time.  Then he said he was grateful for present the moment. Unfortunate things happen. They elude explanation.  But for now, we are well and still making progress, and we should be grateful for that.  I was.The hike today was tough, too.  Smarts Mountain tops 3200 feet.  It was a tough climb, a harbinger of things to come.  I'm not sure why it's not considered one of the Whites.  It had many of their features, including a respectable elevation and a rocky steep rise that went on forever.  At the top was a firetower, which is an obligatory attraction to me despite my trepidation towards these metal structures. The view from above was outstanding.  I could see a rainstorm moving across a mountain range just south.  Thunder in the distance and dark clouds motivated me to descend quickly back to the forest floor.That evening we stayed near the Hexacuba shelter.  To reach the shelter required a nasty upwards climb off trail for 0.3 miles. Uphill and long off-trail hikes are partcularly odious at day's end. But you must sleep somewhere. I found the tenting sites to be sub par. The hexagonally shaped shelter was magnificent, but I don't like donating blood to the skeeters, so I set up the tent in a passable site, atop roots and small stones, figuring my air matress will buffer me from such bumps.","Moose Mountain Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572937,"We're in the land of cairns, manmade piles of stones, ranging from a few inches to feet in height. They show the way of the trail across the treeless mountaintops, which is a good thing, because NH is stingy with the white blazes. Cairns are particularly helpful when visibility is poor, such as in dense fog.  We came upon several such pillars yesterday on Smarts Mt.
Our challenge of today was Mt. Cube. It was tough, taking us one and one-half hours to climb the final 900 feet. Soaked in sweat and panting, I did not think twice about taking the 0.3 mile side trail to its summit. In fact, I did not think of it at all.  Folks find it funny that hikers who are walking over 2000 miles do not often take these very short side trips. To me it's a matter of energy; the reason for expending it needs to be compelling, otherwise, it is better spent getting you to that day's destination. Compelling reasons include badly needed water, a privy, and coffee.  Gorgeous views of mountain ranges and waterfalls have become commonplace, and I will pass them by if they are inconvenient to reach.
Two thrills today along the way.  The first was brought to us by Carl the Omelet Guy. He set up a kitchen tent in the woods just north of NH25C. His specialty is making omelets for passing hikers.  As many eggs as you please, he will make an omelet of that size. One trooper asked for a 24-egg omelet and got it and ate it entirely. I was happy with a three-egger filled with green peppers, onions, and ham. The Omelet Guy also fed us no-bake cupcakes, bananas, oj, and coffee, entirely at his own expense.  You meet amazing people out here.  Eight of us hung about his tent scarfing down the victuals. 
Cheryl and Kelly Collins, longtime friends from my home town, provided the second thrill. I had texted Cheryl from the top of Mt. Mist to give an estimate of our arrival time at NH25, where she would meet us. As a surprise, both hiked in about one-half mile from the trailhead to greet us and escort us back to the car. Knowing full well the cravings of mad hikers, they drove us directly to an ice cream shop, before taking us to their country home in Pike. The home sits high and has an breathtaking view of the mountains. 
Kelly cooked up some cheeseburgers, Cheryl set before us a sumptuous table, and we ate until the point of bursting. I cannot adequately thank them for what they did for us. That evening Kelly gave us options for slackpacking the Whites. My eyes gleamed with hope. They showed me my room for the eve, and that night I slept wonderfully, with visions of the Whites dancing in my head.","Hexacuba Shelter

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572938,"We slack-packed today, going northbound over Mt. Moosilauke.  It was a tough, unrelenting ascent of 3500 feet in just under four miles.  Not carrying a 30-plus pound pack, though, made an enormous difference.  Shop Teacher and I reached the summit, a peak at 4802 feet, in under four hours.  I can't say enough about slack-packing.The summit of Moosilauke was mobbed with scores of hikers, predominantly day hikers. We had to wait in line to have our photo taken in front of the summit sign. I thought thru-hikers got preferential treatment and were moved to the front of the queue (I've become a hiker snob). No such luck.Going down the north side of the mountain was an entirely different experience. It was nosebleed steep. At certain places, wooden steps were secured into the side of the granite mountainside to make steps for ascending and descending. Rebar was strategically placed in the sides of banks to give you something to hold onto as you walked down. A beautiful falls ran parallel to the trail, but it received only passing glances from me. I could not afford to lose a moment's concentration. A misstep and I would still be sliding and bouncing, and yesterday would have been my last blog entry. It was slow going and rough on my ancient knees. At one point, it took thirty minutes to descend three tenths of a mile.  On a typical hike, this distance would have taken less than ten minutes. We had almost reached the bottom of the mountain at Kinsman Notch, when Cheryl and Tyler, their six-year old son, greeted us on the trail, once again lugging soft drinks and snacks.  I asked her to compare the difficulty of Moosilauke to the other Whites.  It's one of the easier ones, she said. These words were like a punch to the gut.  I had hoped to hear that we'd encounter none tougher.  Nonetheless, the first White down, umpteen more to go.On our way back to their home in Pike, she brought us to Walmart so we could resupply.  As usual, I bought too much. Haven't gotten the food thing figured out yet, despite having gone over 1800 miles. Oh, yeah, I crossed the 1800 mile mark this afternoon. Now I'm getting somewhere.Again, I'm so grateful for Cheryl and Kelly's hospitality.  The breakfasts, the lunches, the dinners, the slack-packing, the taxiing, the comfy bed (special thanks to Casey), the bathroom amenities, and, most importantly, their friendship, are powering me through this, and, dare I say it, making the Whites fun.","NH25 -- Kelly and Cheryl's home

Yesterday's nine-miler took all day, so we expected the 16-miler to be a marathon. Kelly drove us to Kinsman Notch, to resume from where we had left off yesterday, and told us his truck would be waiting for us at Franconia Notch whenever we got there. Climbing So. Kinsman Mt. was a bear, but it was exhilarating.  Hand over hand, steep rock climbing, forever, so it seemed, is what it demanded of us. I effectively put away my poles, they becoming more of a nuisance than an aid, and relied on roots, small tree trunks, and rocky grips to pull myself up and over the rocks. Going up steep rocky inclines I find easier than going down them; I don't have to worry as much about falling. And it's better on my knees.  But it does get the ole ticker pumping and the perspiration flowing copiously.  When this hike is over I'm going to have the heart of a thirty-year old and the knees of an octagenarian.The views of the Whites from So. Kinsman Mt. made the suffering worthwhile. You could see Mts. Lincoln, Lafayette, Cannon, No. Kinsman, among countless others. I could not see Mt. Washington, it residing directly beyond Lafayette and Lincoln.Coming down from the No. Kinsman was not as difficult as expected. It was tricky at points, but it was not the endless drop into the abyss recently encountered on Moosilauke. The descent even brought us to Lonesome Lake and the AMC hut by the same name. The spot presented additional photo opportunities, with the deep blue lake in the foreground, Mts. Lafayette and Lincoln in the background, and their reflections in the still water.Close to 7 p.m., almost 12 hours of hiking, we reached the Liberty Springs parking lot and found Kelly's truck where he said he'd leave it. While I fiddled with the mirrors, Shop Teacher was busy ""saving"" a woman's life. Looking frazzled, she had driven into the lot and parked alongside the truck just moments after we got there. She complained of dehydration, and Shop gave her one of the Gatorades in Kelly's truck. The woman was profuse with gratitude. Then the story got odd. Shop jumped into seat next to me and calmly said, ""Quick, lets get out of here."" It seems the woman had eaten a chrysalis mushroom, mistaking it for a pumpkin mushroom. Didn't see that coming. What in blazes was she thinking? (I assume all mushrooms in the wild to be poisonous and leave their harvesting to those in the know). I then noticed the woman sitting on the curb, looking squeamish, clutching the Gatorade, one blink away from losing consciousness (I exaggerate, of course). I put the truck into reverse. As I merged onto the highway, I said to Shop, ""What if she dies? You realize that your fingerprints are all over that Gatorade bottle.  You'll be the number one suspect in a suspicious poisoning.""""I gave her one of your energy bars, with your prints all over it,"" he said. ""Now there will be an APB for two disheveled drifters, last seen in a stolen rust-colored Silverado.""We drove to El Greco's in Lincoln, enjoyed a huge pizza, and had no run-ins with the law.","Kinsman's Notch

I confess having some trepidation. Now we faced Mts. Little Haystack, Lincoln, Lafayette, and Garfield, all well above 4000 feet, with Lincoln at 5089' and Lafayette at 5263'. And we were back to nearly full backpacks.
Yesterday's rain had ceased, but a low ceiling of clouds remained.  We got above treeline at Little Haystack.  The wind was blustery, and the air was moist and cool, so I donned my shell, gloves, and wool hat. It's odd to be wearing winter garb in late July, but such is the Whites.  We walked along the Franconia Ridge and marveled at the splendid view of Franconia Notch below, masked in thin wisps of clouds that drifted heavenwards, like ghosts rising. Across the Notch stood the Kinsmans and Cannon Mt., atop of which was a ski lift and an associated building. The Ridge was exposed for two miles, across the peaks of Lincoln and Lafayette, but we had no concern from the weather. Lafayette was socked in by thin clouds, and a nippy wind encouraged us to take cover behind a wind break, where we ate lunch. About a half-dozen hikers huddled with us.  A jet black, large raven with wings ruffled by the wind took a liking to the crowd because of the frequent morsels tossed its way.  One woman started talking to the raven, calling him Edgar, and praising him for his magnificent bearing.  We took this as our cue to get off the mountain.The descent from Lafayette brought us back into the cover of the trees. Immediately it was too warm for our winter articles. Then we climbed Mt. Garfield, another steep, heart pounding ascent.  But the mountain rewarded us with astounding views of where we had just come from, namely those peaks on Franconia Ridge. Surprisingly, there was no wind, and it was warm and quiet, peaceful even. Again, we were not alone; a camp of about ten girls was already on the summit, all of whom were engaged in some camp exercise that involved sitting in silence and basking in the majesty of the mountains. Thank heavens.The descent from Garfield was harrowing. At times I turned about to climb down near vertical rocks as though descending a ladder.  Progress was at a snail's pace, but safety came first. When we were within six tenths of a mile of Galehead Hut we stealth camped, my legs tired and rubbery from the 12-mile day.  Tomorrow, first thing, we would go to the hut for breakfast.","Franconia Notch

Washington in the distance, you could even see the observatory buildings atop the grand peak.  Shop Teacher and I hope to ascend that peak soon, hopefully on as clear a day as today.
Our hike today had several side tours. We first visited Galehead Hut at 8 a.m., and hovered like vultures just outside the front door, waiting for the paying guests to finish feeding and for the signal to descend on the leftovers. When the moment came, the crew of the Hut placed this morning's leftovers on a kitchen table, and we dove in. 
Our second layover was Zealand Hut, another AMC shelter, this one situated adjacent a cascading stream.  We bought a big bowl of bean and vegetable soup for two bucks, a tasty supplement to our normal lunch fare of peanut butter sandwiches.  
Just beyond Zealand, the trail leveled off, almost becoming flat, for several refreshing miles.  It was an astonishing contrast to the difficult terrain that we have encountered these past four days in the Whites.
 Our next detour was to Thoreau Falls.  A rapid stream flowed through wide grooves carved in rock by the water and over a precipice.  We soaked our feet in the cold water.  My feet thanked me.

After bidding Kelly farewell, Shop Teacher and I started our ascent of Mt. Webster. It proved to be a doozy. I could not recall so much rock scrambling.  Sections of NY came to mind.  But today the rock climbing continued endlessly. Our pace is near 1 mph now, about half that of our normal rate. Why does no one speak of Mt. Webster when the topic of tough climbs in the Whites is discussed? The views from atop Mt. Webster, however, were worth the effort.

Each morning and evening, Huts feed their paying guests breakfast and dinners, and save the leftovers specifically for thru-hikers. It's a symbiotic relationship. Hikers get desperately needed nourishment, and the crews at the Huts have less uneaten food, i.e., garbage, to carry out back to civilization. We joined them and enjoyed a hearty lunch.Visiting the Lake of the Clouds Hut has been a long-term wish. On previous occasions, I'd seen it from the Mt. Washington summit and wanted to go down there and explore it. But, of course, it was remote and not worth the three mile roundtrip across rugged terrain. Now, though, the path to Mt. Washington went through the Lake of the Clouds, so this wish had become a reality.It's a large hut, able to sleep about one hundred.  Because of the Hut's remoteness and because it is above treeline, the crew of the Hut will not turn thru-hikers away. They will allow several hikers to work for stay and will ask any overflow to sleep in the dungeon, for a fee of 10 bucks.  When we arrived at 5 p.m., the crew had already selected the maximum number of workers. We were relegated to the dungeon, located in the basement.The dungeon reminded me of slthe prison in Papillion.  I swear I saw a rat scurry across the floor with a piece of bread in its maw.  The bunks were moldy, the walls made of dripping stone, the floor was sweating, and it was dark, cold, and cramped, supposedly designed to sleep six. There was no possible way I was sleeping there, and I returned to the crew to request better arrangements. They permitted us to sleep in the hut, provided we pay the 10 dollar fee, which I did.  My sleeping quarters was on a bench in the dining area, not terribly comfortable, but at least dry and warm.","Crawford Notch

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573664,"After a dismal night of sleep -- one fellow hiker poked me with his hiking stick to stop me from snoring -- I left the Hut with Shop Teacher at 6:40 a.m. and started the 1.5 mile climb to the Mt. Washington summit. It was chilly, but the skies were clear blue and the wind was an unusually mild 10 mph. The summit came easily and offered beautiful panoramas of the surrounding peaks and valleys.  Several of us, Action Jackson among us, wandered about the mountaintop waiting for the concession building to open, taking in the sights and snapping photos, including the iconic shot of each hiker next to the sign on the actual peak.When the concession opened, we occupied a few tables with our gear, bought ourselves some coffee, and enjoyed second breakfast, our first happening at the Lake of the Clouds Hut. Afterwards, we started a long, arduous hike among the Presidentials.The trail brought us close to the summits of Mts. Clay (who was Pres. Clay?), Jefferson, and Adams, and up and over the summit of Mt. Madison. This last mountain was a half-mile, near vertical ascent. Before attempting the climb, we fueled on leftovers at the Madison Hut, situated strategically at the base of the climb.The descent from Madison took an eternity, being exceedingly rocky, particularly steep, and extending for miles before dropping below treeline. When we stopped for the night at the Osgood tentsite, it felt as though a hammer had been taken to my feet.  My knees felt none too good, too.  Within moments of crawling into my bag, the fly of my tent was rising and falling in synchrony with my snores.  The Whites are tough.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573665,"On the heels of two tough hiking days, Shop Teacher and I thought it advisable to have an easy day. We hiked 4.7 miles to the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, a familiar sight, as I have started many a Mt. Washington hike from here over the course of my lifetime. We had reserved beds at the Libby House in Gorham. The owner of the House picked us up at the Visitor Center and brought us to the residence, a ten mile ride.  Once I saw the spacious lawn, I changed my arrangements to tenting. The owner later shuttled us to Walmart for a quick resupply.  The weather remained spectacular, making me slightly regret not doing more miles, but my feet approved of the rest.  It is Sunday after all.","Osgood tentsite.
",Pinkham Notch,"Jul 30, Sun",4.70
El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573667,"Last night I tented on the back lawn of the Libby House (aka the Barn) because I preferred the privacy of my tent and accompanying freedom to snore over the upstairs bunkhouse.  Besides, the lawn was flat and mown nicely. I had also decided to leave the fly off the tent so I could gaze at the stars in the night sky. What I did not know was that a nearby church rang its bell every hour on the hour throughout the night. I heard every hourly set of chimed bells, from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.  I also did not realize US 2 was such a heavily trafficked road, by roaring, barrelling 18 wheelers, at all hours of the eve. Lastly, I had not noticed the two lampposts that illuminated my flyless tent so brightly that the night sky was not to be seen. Needless to say, it was not a restful night. Hence my day started with some trepidation; I had the Wildcats and Carter Dome ahead of me, and I was already exhausted.
Shop Teacher and my intentions for the day were to hike the aforementioned mountains and camp at the Imp Campsite. Then on the following day we would return to the Barn for another night in Gorham.  Paul, the proprietor of the Barn and our shuttle driver, drove us to Pinkham Notch by 8 a.m.  We bought an AYCE at the Visitor Center, a breakfast prepared by the AMC. It was not worth the expense. The pancakes were rock hard discs and the pan of potatoes was empty and never refilled. We enjoyed the coffee, however, leading to a late hiking start, for which we could never make up.
The climb up Wildcat E was bruising, another NH treat. The views along the ascent though were fantastic.  The sky was cloudless blue again - we've had an astonishing streak of ideal hiking weather.  As Shop is fond of saying, ""Somebody has paid the preacher"".
The Wildcats D, C, and A were also challenging (no Wildcat B), again hitting us with the difficult rock scrambling, up and down. Carter Dome was more of the same, a brutal heart-pounding climb. Up to this point, our rate of travel was just over 1 mph.  As a consolation, it probably was the last of the toughest Whites (though I subscribe to the opinion that the last toughest White is the one I'm currently climbing, no matter its height). On the Dome's summit we sat for lunch, but soon heard thunder and saw rainstorms in the distance sweeping the mountaintops. Since we were on an exposed crest, we thought it prudent to move the banquet below treeline. This took some hustling, however, because the trail remained exposed all the way to Mt. Hight, about a mile distant. Fortunately the thunderstorm held off until then, giving me time to put a pack cover over my rucksack and to don my raingear. It rained for a short while only, but long enough to make everything soaked (raingear keeps the rain out, but traps the sweat, so you are just as wet). 
Eventually, we recognized we would not be able to reach Imp Campsite before nightfall, so we chose to stealth camp at our earliest opportunity.  This only meant we would have a longer hike back to Gorham tomorrow, but it did not have as many formidable mountains to go over as today had.  In two more days we should be through NH. Incomprehensible!","Pinkham Notch

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574349,"I left for Atlanta, GA, five months ago. My initial plans were to finish by Aug. 2. Since I have 298 miles to go, and I'm still in NH, it's unlikely I will finish on schedule. But it feels darn good to be nearly done with this state and on the threshold of the last one.  The Granite State has been hard on me.            The objective of today's hike was to make it to US 2 and to shuttle back to the Libby House. Ascending Mt. Moriah was the big challenge of the day, a typical NH climb, virtually straight up. Near the top were huge stretches of bald faces to walk up. It was also a typical NH descent, virtually straight down.  The last four miles from the Rattle River Shelter to the highway were sweet, a gradual, almost smooth path, quite unusual for NH. You take whatever the trail gives you and be grateful for it. I overhead a southbounder saying you can easily tell who is hiking northbound. They're the walking zombies. Admittedly there's much truth to this. Not only is my equipment wearing thin, but so is my energy.  What stamina I have left I am preserving for the miles I have remaining.  I rarely stop now to swap trail stories with people I pass on the trail. I take fewer blue blazes to see the views. And I've grown weary of telling people my trail name and answering questions about my adventure.  It's not their fault, they're naturally inquisitive; it's that I've one overwhelming focus right now, and that's to complete the task. Anything not in line with this focus is simply draining.That said, one goal I had for this AT hike was not just merely to survive, but to thrive. However, NH has been a challenge to this goal. The state has me questioning my ability to do more than 10 or so miles on any given day. Am I running out of gas just as I'm nearing the finish line? I'm counting on ME to be my badly needed booster shot. Tomorrow! I should be in Maine tomorrow.","Stealth site 
",US 2 -- the Barn,"Aug 01, Tue",11.30
El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574370,"Based on my track record in NH, I wasn't at all confident that I could hike 17 miles today, key to the plan to reach ME by day's end. Paul from the Barn drove Shop Teacher and I to the US 2 trailhead at 7:30 a.m., for an early start. Mt. Hayes came first on the agenda and was surprisingly manageable. Surely, we were no longer in the Whites. Perhaps 17 miles was doable after all.
The succession of lesser mountains afterwards started chipping away at this optimism.  Cascade Mt., Wocket Ledge, and the mountain prior to Dream Lake were bringing back recent memories of the Whites.  (At Wocket Ledge we hit the 1900 mile mark.)  Then came Mt. Success, a beast of a steep climb coming late in our day, an ascent worthy of being put in the class of a White Mountain. It took hours to reach the summit (Mt. Success was the last mountain in NH that we summitted, and it was a doozy). And we pushed on, pig headed about reaching ME and Carlo Co. Shelter.
A wooden sign on the trail told us we had just crossed the NH-ME border.  If I had expected a dramatic terrain change in the new state, I was sorely mistaken. ME picked up where NH left off.  
The climb down to the Carlo Col. Shelter was short, just one-tenth of a mile, but frighteningly steep.  At one point I had to remove my backpack so that I could more nimbly descend in reverse, hanging by my fingers from a rock lip while my feet dangled inches above a ledge I was hoping to land upon.  Once upon the ledge, I reached up to grab my pack and bring it down to where I stood. It was an awkward maneuver.  I sensed this was a prelude to the upcoming Mahoosuc Notch.
At the shelter, I set up my tent on a wooden tent platform, a first-time event for me. Water at the shelter was scarce to come by, but I managed to filter two liters, enough for tonight's dinner and tomorrow's breakfast.","US 2 -- the Barn

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574462,"So Maine is taking over where NH left off. Before we even reached the infamous Mahoosuc Notch, it took us 5 hours to cover 6 miles, much of it over the various peaks of Goose Eye Mtn. The snail's pace and steep rocky terrain have become frustrating. Now I was mentally prepared for Mahoosuc Notch, called the toughest or the funnest mile on the AT, depending on your frame of mind.  I resolved to call it the funnest mile.  I had to remove my backpack at least six times in order to crawl through rock tunnels, pass through tight crevices, and climb over massive boulders.  Some of these boulders were bigger than busses. Holes between rocks were so deep and dark you could not see their bottom. A misstep could result in a long fall.  I even saw snow in some holes, which made it cool in the Notch, like refrigerator air.  It took us 1 hour and forty-five minutes to get through the Notch.  Long before then, though, I was ready for the fun to be over.As our reward for surviving Mahoosuc Notch we had to immediately climb Mahoosuc Arm, an endless ascent reminiscent of the rock climbing in NH. When we finally reached the top, a rainstorm began rolling our way. We descended toward Speck Pond Shelter as fast as we could.  We reached the shelter, a brand new log cabin construction, mere moments before rain fell.  I scarcely got two raindrops on me before I was under its roof.  Then it poured, inducing me to decide to sleep in the shelter rather than pitch my tent in the rain.","Carlo Col.

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574466,"The early part of Maine is proving to be as tough as NH.  Today it took us 11 hours to cover 14 miles. Our pace has fallen upon hard times. This reminds me of a young man we encountered in VT, who mentioned he had gotten Lyme disease. He said an early symptom of the ailment was a marked drop off in the number of miles he was able to hike on a given day.  Whereas he used to hike 20 miles per day, he discovered he scarcely had energy to hike 15. This tale has me wondering if I have Lyme disease now.  I, too, have noticed a big drop off in my miles per day. Then again, the terrain has been brutal.
For instance, Mt. Baldpate was borderline insanity to climb. The last 300 or more feet of elevation was ovet exposed slabs of layered rock. And a strong wind blew.  As I ascended I dared not look down. Midway in the climb, Shop said to me, ""If my wife saw me now, she would sh*t."" I would have understood if she did.
The rocks were slick with moisture from yesterday's rain. I fell hard, the hardest yet, scraping up my left arm.  I landed on one of my Leiki hiking poles and bent it. These poles have taken a severe beating and are ready for the junk heap, but they still have to carry me to Katahdin.
I reached my fatigue limit and called Diane to ask her to pick us up one day earlier than planned, which she readily agreed to.  We met her at East B Hill Rd.

Instead of finding Diane, we found a husband, wife, and their two daughters waiting for us at the South Arm Rd parking lot. The man thru-hiked (NOBO) in 2015. They offered us trail magic.

Never before had I seen or eaten hot dogs of this color.  I slathered generous amounts of mustard and relish on them. After I devoured the first of the dogs, a stiff wind flipped the plate over, and the other dog landed on my lap, mustard side down. I cleaned it best I could, but my beige hiking pants now had a huge swath of mustard yellow on my crotch. Mustard stains, I later learned, are difficult to remove.

He's an older gent - I'd venture even older than I - from the Northwest, who loves to hike. It's his second run at the AT; he completed it about 16 years ago.
The three of us hiked together for much of the day.  In nine miles, we summitted three significant peaks, Saddleback, the Horn, and Saddleback Junior.  We parted ways with Socks at the Poplar Ridge Lean-to.  He has managed to hike over 1950 miles without carring a shelter, that is, a tent or a hammock. While this means less weight to carry, he needs to be mindful of the weather and lean-to locations. He can't ""cowboy"" camp (sleeping bag under the stars) if there's a prospect of rain. So he stops at a lean-to if the chances of reaching the next one within a reaonable time are slim.

The reason for the last minute food purchase is that today is the start of our hike through the infamous 100-mile wilderness, and I wanted to have enough food to carry me through our planned six-day traversal -- Shop and I had decided to carry six days of food rather than schedule a food drop and pickup at some midway point, something we found to be both expensive ($80) and restrictive because we did not want to be tied to a rendezvous schedule, not knowing how difficult we would find these woods.  Six days of food. Yikes! The thought of its weight made me apprehensive.  I hadn’t carried that much food since the Smokies.

Breakfast at Shaws was a fiasco.  Too many of us signed up for the well beloved feast, and the hostel could not find seating for us all.  So several of us unfortunates had to sit in the living room and await an opening at a dining room table.  By the time I got seated most of the food had been inhaled by the earlier diners.  I got one pancake, a smidgen of syrup, a whiff of home fries, an eyedropper’s amount of orange juice, a spoonful of scrambled eggs, and a bad attitude; not exactly how I wanted to enter the Wilderness.  Not only that, we did not get a shuttle ride back to the trail-head until 9:40 a.m.  Perhaps the hostel should feed its guests in shifts, one group at 7 a.m. and another at 8 a.m., limiting the early shift to folks who want to get back to the trail first thing, while the later start time serves for those who plan to linger about the hostel premises.  
Despite the late start, we managed to reach an unofficial tent site at mile 2089.6 aside the Long Pond Stream, a 14 mile accomplishment.  It was a fine day for hiking, sunny, warm, and breezy.  We passed several ponds along the way, confirming what many have said about the Wilderness being a beautiful stretch of real estate.  I rank the difficulty level of our first day in the Wilderness as moderate because the backpack was heavily laden with so much food and the terrain had countless pesky ups and downs.","ME 15, Monson

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576295,"It was a tough day.  In addition to the various steep peaks to climb, such as Barren Mt., Fourth Mt., Three and a Half Mt., Third Mt., Columbus Mt., and Chairback Mt., it starting raining about 10 a.m. and continued throughout the day, making the rocks and roots especially slick.  My worn out boots gained little traction on these surfaces.  I went down hard, twice, the first onto my right elbow and hip, the second into an awkward position with my right leg bent under me behind my back.  Gratefully, I suffered no serious injury – I certainly do not want a season-ending injury at this late stage.  But my hip stung from the first fall.
The difficulty level of the 100-mile wilderness surprised me.  Everything I’ve read and heard about this stretch of the trail extols its beauty and the ease in crossing it.  The peaks I encountered today, however, were by no means trivial.  It took Shop and I twelve hours to cover sixteen miles, that’s how hard we found them to be.  To ratchet up the misery level, it started pouring just as we set up evening camp.  Not wanting to cook in a deluge, I had a cold dinner of energy bars and peanut M&Ms within the confines of my tent, fully cognizant of the potential downside of leaving food odors within, namely, enticing another unwelcome visit from those furry beasts that don’t trouble themselves to use the front door. 
On the upside, I went to sleep knowing I have less than 100 miles to go to reach Baxter Peak.","Campsite at mile 2089.6

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576298,"It rained hard all night, but let up just before morning, just in time for me to break camp without getting soaked.  Our first challenge was to cross the West Branch Pleasant River without taking our boots off.  The branch was wide, about 60 feet across, and there were too few rocks above water level to step on.  We walked up and down the stream looking for other places to cross. Finding none, I took off my boots and socks, put on my crocs, rolled up my pant legs, and splashed through the cold water.  Not wanting to change shoes, Shop went through in his trail runners.  Frankly, I believe I made the better call, for I walked in dry boots today.

Though today’s hike carried us across four high peaks, Gulf Hagas Mt., West Peak, Hay Mt., and White Cap Mt., the last three being above 3000 feet, it was not as difficult as yesterday’s.  Granted, the rocks and roots were still wet and slick (I face-planted once, in slow motion, and broke my fall with both hands), the streams were swollen, I was somewhat undernourished from last night’s “meal”, and my packed weighed more from the wet gear, at least it was not raining.  Further, the terrain after White Cap Mt. leveled off, making it a sweet section to traverse.  White Cap Mt. is the last of the biggies; until I reach Katahdin I will see no more peaks above 2000 feet. This alone propels me.  As an aside, supposedly you can see Katahdin from White Cap Mt., but I could not distinguish it in the distance amidst the blue haze.  That night I tented reveling in the knowledge that the next three hiking days would be over relatively flat terrain.  To keep me humble, mosquitoes in biblical proportions plagued me while I ate and later congregated just outside my bug netting, buzzing and knocking, asking to be let in.","Campsite at mile 2105.5

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576299,"My hiking is becoming faster; I am feeling stronger, more confident than when I passed through the Whites and southern. Maine, and I’m getting increasingly excited as we draw closer to the destination.  My backpack is getting lighter, too, my having eaten already three days of food, this being our fourth day in the Wilderness.  Because today’s terrain is mostly flat, I was able to reach 3 mph, not mind-numbing fast in our world of rapid transit, but for me this pace nearly pierces the sound barrier.  And every uphill along the way I was able to power through.  
The day passed quickly, almost a blur, with essentially nothing noteworthy to speak of, just more miles of woods.  Several people have reminded me to enjoy the remaining miles, but I’m struggling with this.  By now I’ve seen enough mountains and streams and lakes, I’ve slept enough times in a tent or a hostel or a hotel, I’ve eaten enough Ramen noodles and pasta sides and tuna, and I’ve spent enough days in clothes soaked from rain or sweat.  Now I’m yearning for my own backyard, my own bed, my own brewed coffee, and dry clothes.  It’s time to finish this.  One person said, “No one who has completed the hike has wished they had done it one day faster.”  I’m sure I’d be the exception that disproves this rule.  This is, I think, my 172nd day on this mission.  I would have done it twenty days faster if I could have.  That’s not to say that hiking the AT has not been one of the greatest adventures of my life.  I’m just saying it still would have been a great adventure even if it had been shorter.  My hat’s off to those who have fallen in love with life on the trail, who loathe the idea of it ever ending, and who are already planning their next long distance hike, perhaps on the Pacific Coast Trail or on Continental Divide Trail. I have met many of these people along the way, and they are a marvel to me.  But I know my limitations, and the AT has brought me to those limits many times over.  That I haven’t quit is a marvel to me.","East Branch Lean-to

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576301,"The hike today was our fifth consecutive day in the 100-mile wilderness.  While the lay of the land was not as flat as yesterday’s, and some sections of rocks and roots and mud were downright difficult, it still proved to be a relatively easy day’s work.  The shore of Pemadumcook Lake and an outcropping on Nesuntabunt Mt. both treated us to unobstructed views of Katahdin.  We also tried to glimpse the solar eclipse from our vantage point while on the mountain, but failed to see any definitive darkening of the sun.

The biggest surprise of the day was running into Norseman, who drove his white pickup truck one hour along a gravel road, to bring trail magic to hikers in a remote area where you least expect to find people, let alone free food.  He, too, was a thru-hiker, but was sidelined with an ankle injury.  Rather than sit around ruing his bad luck, he decided to help other hikers complete their journeys by providing much needed nourishment.  After five days in the woods, I knew I was running a serious calorie deficit.  Hence I made a gallant effort to recoup some energy, downing two Gatorade drinks and two honey buns. Some might not consider this nourishment, but it fueled the remainder of my day.As for surprises, I have been asked on multiple occasions what has surprised me most about the AT.  Perhaps the biggest surprise has been the general lack of wildlife that I have seen from the trail.  Certainly there’s been no shortage of squirrels and chipmunks, but I was anticipating gaggles of deer and moose, flocks of bear and wild pig, herds of mink, beavers, marmots, and bobcats.  However, the wilderness surrounding the trail is so vast, I suppose the wild animals have no difficulty staying away from this narrow corridor traveled by humans, well out of sight.","Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576302,"The trail today was about as flat as any encountered thus far, with a brief climb of Rainbow Ledges from where we saw Katahdin, the top of which was covered in clouds.  I had another day of strong hiking, moving as though I had wings, the level ground making great athletes of us all, but I banged my left shin hard against the blunt, sawed end of a branch lurking at the edge of the trail. The branch did not budge and I sounded off with a vociferous “ouch” or something innocuous to that effect.  I hobbled for some time afterwards, but soon thought nothing more about it.
Shop and I emerged from the 100-mile wilderness and reached the Abol Bridge by mid-afternoon.  The view from the bridge was picturesque, the Penobscot River flowing strongly beneath it, a slower moving tributary joining the Penobscot in front of the bridge, a loon swimming in an eddy, a young boy standing up to his knees in the tributary, fishing, a young lady standing on the shore, looking on, and Mt. Katahdin looming large in the background beneath a deep blue sky.  I was spellbound and felt something inside strangely akin to joy.  
We crossed over to the Abol Campground and its General Store. An active logging road goes over the bridge and passes in front of the store.  Several trucks loaded with lumber rumbled by, kicking up plumes of dust that coated everyone and everything. Foremost on the agenda was to shower and then to launder.  For a time I walked about in my black long johns and Marmot rain jacket while my every day clothes spun and rinsed and tumbled dry.  It was exactly the wrong gear to wear, for it was hot, 86 degrees, a temperature unheard of in late August this far north in Maine.  The propane-fueled generator that provides electricity to the entire Abol Campground complex failed on account of the heat, delaying our laundry.  I tried to sit inconspicuously in front of the store while we awaited power to be restored, but I received many an odd glance from people staying at the Campground, mothers hurrying their children along, admonishing them not to make eye contact with me.

After laundry completed, we went about setting up camp at Abol Pines.  Again we bumped into Norseman and his white pickup truck full of beverages and snacks.  The mosquitoes were again voracious, so we sought safe harbor in the Northern Restaurant, which is attached to the general store.  There we ordered dinner and set about discussing plans for tomorrow, including our approach to the base of Katahdin.

Afterwards we returned to the Abol Pines campsite and retired early, as we are wont to do, particularly to escape the hoards of mosquitoes that were patiently awaiting our return and working up their appetites.  Shortly after dark, it started raining, hard.  Fine, I thought, as long as it does not rain two days from now, when we plan to summit Katahdin.  More than one person has warned us against climbing the mountain in the rain, a caution I fully take to heart.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576303,"Again it rained hard all night and stopped just before we needed to break camp.  We’re down to the last 20 miles of the hike.  I cannot put my feelings into words. Happy? Proud? Anxious?  None adequately captured the jumble of emotions I had this morning.
We signed our names to the registry, posted at a kiosk just inside Baxter State Park, for staying at the Katahdin Stream Campground.  Only 12 thru-hikers are allowed to stay there overnight on any given night, so we went early, 6:30 a.m., to assure ourselves a place.  Then we returned to the Northern Restaurant to enjoy a leisurely breakfast before heading out over the 10 miles that took us to the Katahdin Stream Campground.  
When we returned to the trail, a trail runner who worked for Baxter State Park met us at the footbridge leading into the park.  He asked for our trail names and then, after crosschecking his list, told us we had improperly registered for the campground.  Apparently, we should not have gone back to breakfast after signing the registry, but continued on through the park. We apologized for our innocent error and promised never to do it again.  
While we were talking to the trail runner, Outsource arrived at the footbridge.  He was a thru-hiker who started in GA in mid-march, his name deriving from the fate of his last job.  He turned 65 years old on the trail.  He said his wife was supporting him over the next two days, had a van, and would gladly drive us to Millinocket when our summit was over.  Later that afternoon, we met her in the park, and she treated us to baloney sandwiches and Cokes.

Again, the mosquitoes were savage.  For the first two miles I was preoccupied with swatting my arms, face, and neck instead of being concerned about where I placed my feet.  One swat killed three mosquitoes, they swarmed so thickly.  Much of the trail paralleled the Penobscot River, and I watched several rafters floated by.  I made a mental note to add that to my bucket list, it looked so much fun.      
We reached the Birches Leantos around 3 p.m., and set up camp, joined by MacGyver, Trinity, Sir Linear, Princess Bubblegum, Superman, and Scarecrow.  Baxter State Park quarantines thru-hikers at these leantos, keeping us separate from day visitors and campers.  It has two shelters, each supposedly capable of sleeping six and tenting accommodations that are meager; the nearest water is a quarter of a mile away.  Though we were treated like second-class citizens, nothing could dampen our spirits for we were on the cusp of reaching our goal. That night several of us sat around a fire pit, reminiscing, swapping stories of our travels over the many miles.  Princess Bubblegum and Superman were trying to convince others to start the ascent of Katahdin at 1 a.m., in order to reach the summit before daybreak, and thus to watch the sunrise from the top.  Since this amounted to night hiking up a very steep mountain, I declined quickly, this not exactly fitting my idea of prudent.  During the night I heard them pack and leave on their quest.  I slept like a kid on Christmas Eve, meaning hardly at all.","Abol Bridge
",Katahdin Stream Campground,"Aug 23, Wed",9.90
El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576305,"I started to break camp around 5:30 a.m., so anxious was I to get this day going.  The weather was fine, ideal for summiting.  Soon, I heard MacGyver and Trinity disassembling their tent and Shop Teacher his hammock.  As Shop and I walked to the trailhead, the only word that came to mind was surreal.  Was this really the last day of the thru-hike?  My left shin ached as we walked, and I recalled the hard knock from two days ago.  I lowered my sock to look at it and noticed a considerable bruise.  No matter.  I can worry about this bruise tomorrow.
The climb up Mt. Katahdin started easily enough, but soon it turned into a steep ascent.  Once above tree line, the climb became technical, requiring much hand-over-hand scrambling and the clutching of rebar to get over and through boulders.  Despite the ache in my shin, I climbed energetically.  I surprised myself with the vigor with which I raised myself over some of the rocks. Pure adrenaline at this point, of this I am sure.
The steepest section of the climb led to the Gateway, beyond which the terrain leveled off at a region called the Tableland.  While on the Tableland, off in the distance, I could see the Katahdin sign on the summit, shrouded in fog.  I then moved like a man inspired.  When I reached the sign, I patted it several times, as though to convince myself it was real and to signify to myself that I had in fact reached the end.  What surprised me though was my stoicism.  Last night I half expected to be emotionally overcome when I reached the sign, but to my surprise I was all business.  The job was done; time now for picture taking.  Perhaps, though, in the back of my mind the job was not yet done - there was still the business of getting down, and I was a bit worried about this getting down business, since it was especially difficult going up.  Perhaps I was bottling my emotions until I arrived safely back at the campground.

A mob scene greeted us on the summit.  I’d not seen so many people on any given peak since Moosilauke (or perhaps Mt. Washington).  All of the thru-hikers currently on the summit, Outsource, Sir Linear, MacGyver, Trinity, Fireball, Shop Teacher, and I, gathered for a joint photo at the sign.  Then we each had our photos taken individually, and in groups.  On the peak, the wind blew cold and steady.  I had to put on a third layer, my trusty Marmot rain jacket, which I relied upon throughout the hike.  Clouds appeared and dissipated, revealing magnificent views of the surrounding mountains, of Knife’s Edge, and of the trail leading back down.

The descent was hair-raising.  Not once did I pull my poles from the backpack, rendered useless by the rough, steep terrain, using instead my hands and the strength of my arms to steady, lift, and lower myself down the precipitous boulders I not too long ago clambered up and over.  My aching shin throbbed now, making the downward trip feel like an eternity.  Eventually we reached the Katahdin Stream Campground to find Outsource, Sue his wife, MacGyver, Trinity, Fireball, and Scarecrow waiting for us to go into town.  Katahdin proved a fitting finish to an epic journey.  I would not have had it any other way.

Sue drove us to the AT Lodge in Millinocket, where we inquired about available rooms.  After being told only bunks in the bunkhouse remained, I bristled.  A bunkhouse was not to be the final note of this opus.  So we signed up for the shuttle to Medway in the morning, where I planned to catch a bus to Bangor to meet Diane, and returned to the van, asking Sue to bring us to the Katahdin Inn.  Shop Teacher and I split a room, and then we wandered about Millinocket seeking sustenance, which I found in the form of burgers at McDonald’s and a foot-long sub at Subway.  I guess I’m not entirely through with life on the trail.","Katahdin Stream Campground

El Vago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576306,"Sue, Outsource, Shop Teacher, Scarecrow, and I had breakfast in downtown Millinocket, a last meal before she drove us to the AT Lodge to catch our 9 o'clock shuttle.  It got us to the Irving gas station in Medway, the official bus stop, fifteen minutes before the arrival of the Cyr bus heading to Bangor.  I still found it difficult to fathom we were heading home.  It started to sink in, though, when Shop Teacher and Scarecrow got off at the first bus station in Bangor, the connector stop for Concord Coach lines.  I bade them farewell, giving Shop Teacher the standard thru-hiker fist bump. He had become my good friend and constant companion these past months and many miles. We first met back in North Carolina, sitting on a bench on the trail with a view of Hump Mt. and Big Hump Mt. We then hiked together for a spell with Multi-tool in Pennsylvania, and then with regularity after the Delaware Water Gap. I promised we’d have him and his wife up for a vacation in Rangeley, ME, next summer.  Until then, have a good hike my friend.Diane picked me up at the second bus station in Bangor, used by the Greyhound bus line.  She drove the entire way home to MA, through the thickest traffic -- which stirred in me great revulsion -- I being too fatigued to drive, with my left shin aching terribly (I cannot imagine that I would have been able to climb Mt. Katahdin the way my shin currently felt, but I am certain the ascent and descent of the mountain is what aggravated the injury).  Once home I plopped my backpack into the corner of the foyer and collapsed into a sofa, not a smidgen of adrenaline remaining to carry me another step. Oddly, it felt like I had never left home. Was it all a dream?  Did I really spend nearly 6 months in the woods and on the road, walking from GA to ME?  Inconceivable.  Then again, there are those photos in my camera, 4350 of them, concrete proof of El Vago’s most excellent adventure.",,Home,"Aug 25, Fri",0
