Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542491,"Welcome to my 2017 AT Hike journal. I intend to keep this updated as I go north, so family and friends will know where I am at and can get some flavor for what I am experiencing. I have been thinking about an AT Thru Hike for about 5 years and have been day/section hiking for almost 10 years now. I have targeted the date I will quit work (retire) and what date I am going to start out from Springer Mtn. We will see how those dates stick. I will try to update my equipment and share a little bit more about my hike prep in later entries. Thanks for taking the time to show interest in my journal.",,View Entry,"Jul 17, Sun",0
Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552885,"I am ramping up training and reading anything I can get my hands on regarding thru hiking. Also, still working full time, so cardio and time on the trail is challenging. I have not been able to get into the mountains for a couple months, but have been going up to the state park just north of my home, with 22 lbs. on my back and doing an easy 5 mile loop. Not many ups and downs, but beats banging the treadmill at home. I plan to start out with pretty low miles, so hopefully I do enough before Feb 20 to not punish myself too much in the first few days. I was fortunate to attend an ATC presentation at the Charlotte REI before Christmas. Great job by the young lady talking about her 2015 Thru and her job as a Ridge runner in the GSMNP last year. She gave me some things to think about regarding leave no trace. I went ahead and got GutHooks App to supplement AWOL's guide. I should have plenty of information, no excuses in that area. Counting down the days before I quit work and start this adventure.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Tue",0
Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554657,"I am staying very busy with last minute preparations. My last day of work was 2/6, so I have more time to train and am checking off the long list of things to do before I head onto the trail, and away from home for months. Trail prep is going well. I have been able to ramp up my day hikes around the area and can tell my legs are getting stronger (let's keep this in perspective) and my overall conditioning has gone from ""prone on couch"" to ""moving around with some purpose"". I know I will suffer on the first ascents in Georgia, but that comes with the territory. I did my final pack ""stuffing"" today. It was like trying to cram 10 pounds of manure into the proverbial 5 pound bag. Looks like those insulated booties are going to be staying home. I don't recall ever carrying 6 days of food, so that was a rude awakening. Oh well, nothing that thousands of others have not dealt with before me. I head down to Atlanta on Friday to spend some time with family and then get dropped off about a mile from the Springer summit on Monday morning. The weather has been improving as it gets closer, but unless a polar vortex slips down, it's a go on Monday morning. Gotta learn to hike in the rain, the snow, the cold, etc. When I committed to a February start, I signed up for some crappy weather at times. I will probably post a couple more updates before I start, but I am excited and ready to ride the roller coaster.",,Not Much Time Left,"Feb 15, Wed",0
Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554702,"Not a lot to update on today, but I thought I would go ahead and provide some general information regarding the AT and thru-hiking it for anyone following my journal that is not familiar with the trail. I have gotten a number of questions from family and interested friends and thought I would provide them some background. If you are a seasoned AT enthusiast you can probably skip the rest of this entry, as I doubt you will learn anything. - The Appalachian Trail is a public footpath covering 2190.3 miles- It is maintained primarily by volunteers of local hiking clubs- It runs from Georgia to Maine (or vice versa) through 14 states- People who hike it all in one year are called thru-hikers- People who hike it all over several years are called section hikers- It pretty much runs up the spine of the Appalachian Mountain range- It was designed and constructed in the 1920's and 1930's- Most of the trail is in the ""backwoods"" and not real wilderness- There are three sided/roofed shelters generally 8-10 miles apart on the trail- Most people sleep in shelters or in a tent they bring with them - Food must be carried in your backpack, but there are usually towns close to the trail about every 3-5 days to re-supply, shower and get some hot food- It is common for thru-hikers to start out alone, they may hike alone during the day, but generally hikers camp around others- Over 4000 people will likely attempt to thru-hike this year, one in four will finish, less than 15,000 people have thru-hike the AT all time. - The average length of time to thru-hike is about 6 months- Despite urban legend, ticks and water-borne bacteria present more of a danger to hikers than black bears and venomous snakes- While the highest elevation on the AT is 6667 feet above sea level, the trail has many, many ups and downs, that are estimated to be the equivalent of climbing and descending Mt. Everest from sea level 16 times.",,AT Thru Hike Primer,"Feb 16, Thu",0

Many of the Rhodi's look like skeletons with their leaves gone and root systems all charred. In Franklin, NC tonite, watching it rain.

Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556099,"Day 3 in the Smokies was my biggest challenge to date. When I woke in the shelter at Siler's Bald the wind was whipping and it was in the lower 30's. Some in the shelter were saying they were just going to stay in their sleeping bags all day and not deal with it. I shoved out about 730 and headed up Mt. Buckley and then then up Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT at 6667 feet of elevation. The wind was blowing about 30 mph and the rain was coming sideways. The clouds were rolling by quickly and the fog was very thick. On the windward side gusts had to be 50 mph and would almost knock me over. It was, in one word, miserable. I was wet with rain on the outside of my rain suit, and wet with sweat on the inside. Clearly, there was no one else up there, except for Chef, who was about 20 minutes behind me. I made it over the top and walked in the rain the rest of the day. I did slip into the public bathroom at Newfound Gap, use the facilities and relish the warmth of indoors and being out of the elements. The thought crossed my mind, that it might be a pleasant place to just spend the night. I chose otherwise, and moved up Mt. Kephart and got to Icewater Springs Shelter just as the skies opened up and it started pouring. Chef, Nope, Wick and Haiku were my shelter mates for the night and we had some enjoyable conversation. It was good to be out of the rain and wind.","Siler Bald shelter

Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556100,"I awoke on day 17 of my trip to cold temps, blustery winds, but bright sunshine. The shelter sits on a bluff that looks to the East and you can see miles of mountains, including the Black Mountains east of Asheville, where Mt. Mitchell is found. The temps had dropped into the mid-20's and all of the rain from the day/night before had frozen solid. I included a picture of my frozen sock in yesterday's journal. I head out and found sections of the trail to be like a hockey rink. It was slow going as I picked my steps away from the ice and tried to stay upright. The wind was blowing strongly from the west at about 20 miles per hour, but the views were stunning, by far the best day in the Smokies. I passed Charlie's Bunion and continued to deal with ice patches all day, but it was worth it. I only did 12 miles this day, but the miles went slower than expected as I stopped to take several pictures and had lunch on a rock outcropping with Chef as we sat in the sun and looked out to the mountains to the East. I made it to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter around 330 and Lucky Charms, Chef, Wick and Haiku piled in as well. There were several others in the shelter including 3 ETSU students from Abingdon, VA. At dusk, Switchback showed up after hiking 28 miles that day. That dude is a beast. Good guy, though.","Icewater Springs Shelter

Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556104,"Day 18 started early for me, as I hit the trail before 7am. I had a high mile day planned, as my brother was going to meet me at I-40 for a couple days of R&R in his Knoxville home. It was all the incentive I needed. The weather was perfect. A little cool to start, gloves and stocking cap; but those soon came off and it was shorts on a windless, warm day. There were still great views to the East and West for the initial 10 miles. I passed and got passed by Switchback, LC and Chef several times throughout the day. There were section and day hikers aplenty around the Mt. Cammerer trail. The last 7 miles or so, were all downhill and pounded my ancient knees. I ate lunch with Lucky Charms on a rocky view. I traded my week old leftover tortillas and beef jerky for a cookie with him. A good deal in my mind. I finished the last few miles with Chef, who is a great kid from Atlanta. He is starting Law School in August and is a super person to spend time around. My brother was waiting for me at 4pm and we headed to K-town with a stop in the McDonald's drive-through. My hiker appetite has kicked in. My sister-in-law made a dinner fit for a king and I got ready to enjoy my first zero. I included a picture of some plane wreckage from a jet that crashed in the early 1980's on Snake Den Ridge right next to the trail, less than 100 ft. from the top of the ridgeline. Both pilots lost their lives. Sad reminder of the dangers these mountains can present in many different ways.","Tri-Corner Knob shelter

Even though the forecast is for snow tonight on the trail and this week looks to be very cold, I decided to swap out my 5 degree bag to my 20 degree bag. I need the space in my pack, especially with the 7 day resupply I will start out with tomorrow. I swung by the REI in Knoxville and picked up a pair of snow gaiters this evening. My hope is that there is no snow at the trailhead and I can just get them returned. I would like to thank all of those that have put placed comments in the Guest Book. Your well wishes and encouragement are appreciated. It is great to hear from those that I am disconnected with on this journey.A few reflections so far from about 3 weeks on the trail:- The people are the best part, folks really bond and help one another- The trail seems to get progressively more challenging as your stamina improves- I learn something every day about how to deal with this new challenge- Weather is big damn deal. It forces me to adjust when it goes bad- My support from home has been fantastic, thanks!!!My favorite moment from the trail so far was when I was descending down Clingman's Dome in the rain toward Newfound Gap and met two Southbound Hikers coming in the opposite direction. We talked for a moment and they told me they were finishing up the last 200 miles of their 2190 mile journey. They were in their mid-twenties, had the scraggly beards of thru-hikers and were clearly enjoying their time on the trail despite the lousy conditions that day. They wished me well and gave me some encouragement. I congratulated them on the feat they were about to achieve and told them I wished I were in their shoes. They both smiled and shook their heads. ""No, we wish we were you"", they replied. ""You are about to have the best time of your life"".

The weather was sketchy with a few sprinkles here and there, but mostly just cloudy, windy and cool. The climb up Virginia's highest mountain was not too bad, and the AT is excused from going to the lackluster summit of Mt. Rogers. The trail through the Mt.

We fought rain off and on all day. That really sucks. Hiking in a rain jacket is like hiking in a sauna all day, especially on uphill climbs. I guarantee, there is more perspiration moisture on the inside than rain on the outside. Oh yea, our sweat is starting to get kind of pungent by now. Putting on and taking off rain gear slows down the progress and is very annoying. Remember the pack has to come off for all clothing changes. The biggest issue was making the Pizza cutoff. Well, the brothers got there just after 3:30 and I rolled in just after 4:00. Needless to say, pizzas were ordered and 2 liter sodas added. Slogoen also was at the shelter while we ate. He had one piece of my large meat lovers, but I took care of the rest. The brothers each had their own large. Not the typical trail meal. Later in the evening we were joined by 4 other thru hikers.

They were long miles, in part because of the annoying rocks that littered almost every step of the first 6-7 miles. You have to concentrate on every foot drop and cannot reach a favorable pace. It was mostly top of ridge hiking for the first half of the day, then twisty turny paths down to Atkins and I-81. As a transportation guy, I do not have any love for circuitous routes. While I was glad to be going home for a few days, I was saddened to know that I would probably not catch up to Highliter and Sarlac again. They are flyers and don't take a lot of zeros. They have been very good trail friends to me and have hiked off and on with me through some tough times and over 250 miles. I wish them well and know their journey will end in Maine. I got to Atkins early enough to eat the Hiker Burger at the Barn Restaurant with a couple other young thru hikers. Then I laid in the grass next to the highway exit and got some sun in true hiker trash style. My wife arrived in mid-afternoon and I am enjoying my time at home for now.

I plan to take 3 days at home, which will give me some time to review my gear as the weather is improving and my trail knowledge has grown. In these days I will share some observations and thoughts. I have lost 22 lbs. so far. That is not too surprising, but I recognize that I need to find some better answers for my breakfast and lunch diet. At my age, it is nice to drop some weight, but I honestly think there was as much muscle as fat that got dropped. I haven't weighed this little since college. I want to continue to have cold breakfasts and lunches, but I need more value from my food intake. Almost every hiker on the trail is fighting some physical issues. Typically lower extremity. I saw one hiker in Damascus that had just finished a 25+ mile day on a lower leg that was purple from his toes to his mid-calf. Every day most hikers inspect their feet for new or enhanced blisters and go through the daily ritual of popping blisters and taping feet. It adds about 10 minutes to my morning routine each day. My feet are pretty banged up right now and I hope the 3 days at home will give them some time to heal. I do feel fortunate that at my age, my overall health on the trail has been very good. My knees are hanging in there, although the last week or so of high mileage days made them quite tender on the downhills. I have recognized that I need to make a philosophical shift in my hiking approach. I have been treating each 3-5 day section as a trip with a reward at the end. I have focused on the destination of each section. To make it the entire 2190 miles, I need to enjoy each and every day. I will reduce my mileage a bit going forward and increase my time with other hikers at shelters and hostels. It's really about the journey and not the destination.","Interstate 81 exit at Atkins, VA

I lunched up there with Henry, while the clown that was sitting at the photo spot finished his lunch.

It is filled with jumbled boulders that have fallen off the cliffs over millions of years. Some are the size of large cars. There is still frozen snow and ice between some of the rocks and there are voids, crevasses and caves. It is like something from Jurassic Park.
The only way through the notch is to put away the poles and crawl, jump or pull yourself. It is an absolute full body workout. We did it in less than 2 hours, which is pretty good.

It would be a wet trail, but I knew I would be out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness in 10 miles, and sitting at the base of Katahdin by mile 21. The last full day of hiking had finally come.
There were no significant climbs and the only issue was the nasty thunderstorm that accompanied me in the last 3 miles to The Birches Lean-to. They are reserved for long distance hikers by BSP. I interacted with several BSP Rangers during the day, and they were all informative and supportive of thru hikers. 
I included a picture of one of the BSP waterfalls. It was very impressive and probably had more water than any other falls I saw on the trail. Zen Master and Preacher are the only other thru hikers at The Birches tonight.
Tomorrow I plan to summit Katahdin and finish my hike. Tomorrow will be all about me. I am a pretty selfish person and this hike was about me alone. However, I would not be here without the phenomenal support of my wife, Michelle. No one, nobody, on this trail had the level of support she gave me.

Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571440,"I was awake at 415 this morning, but did not want to disturb Zen Master. Then he spoke, ""you wanna go climb a mountain today?"". I replied into the darkness, ""we got nothing else to do"". So we packed up to mostly sunny skies and headed out for the last 5 miles of this 2190 mile adventure. He was about 10 minutes ahead of me, a much faster hiker and planned to spend some time on the highly exposed Knife Edge Trail after he reached Baxter Peak. I have no appetite for heights and that was never a consideration for me.
I was out by 530 and the Hunt trail to the top started getting sketchy above treeline. There were a lot of exposures to long falls, some Rebar pull ups and one just scarey crab crawl over a rock with nothing to grip. By 815 I reached Tableland and knew the worst was behind me. As I approached the iconic sign there were lots of thoughts swimming around my head. This hike is the most difficult thing I have ever done. Fortunately,  I was the only person there for about 20 minutes, so any emotions will remain a secret. A family came up one of the other trails and took my pictures. The wind gusts were approaching 45 mph, so additional layers were necessary after climbing ceased. I stayed about half an hour at the summit, and took the slightly less harrowing Abol Trail back down. I was back at the ranger station by 1215.
Katahdin is the most stunning mountain on the AT, and climbing it cannot be considered hiking. It is frighteningly beautiful.  The rock scrambling is straight up at times and slips can be fatal.  The reward today was crystal clear views of hundreds of lakes and ponds, plus the other rugged peaks within BSP. It was the best view in 2190 miles. 
I got a ride into Millinocket with the first car I stuck out my thumb for. No one can resist a pretty face. 
As an update on my hiking partner, Wiz, he plans to let the meds work on his Lymes Disease for about 10 days, then finish Maine and make his flip.
My trip is over. I will reflect for a few days and make some more entries over the next week. I head home to NC on Wednesday. I will provide my opinions on the hike, my equipment choices, my hiking style and most importantly thank the many people who were so helpful and inspirational to me. I have also posted a few more photos from the last day.

Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572157,"I have been asked some questions on equipment and give opinions on what I used. If you are not a hiker, this may not be of any interest to you.Pack - Zpacks Arc Haul - good, mice chewed a hole in the belt in VA and a belt pouch loop broke along the way, Zpacks replaced the entire belt quickly in flight and I did not miss a beat.  The pack is incredibly light, I never used a rain cover, but did use a trash compactor bag as a liner. My gear never got wet. When I finished I noticed some wear on the back panel straps and Zpacks is sending me replacements no charge. Great service and a good pack. Zpacks are not cheap. I did see a lot of Osprey packs out there and they seemed to satisfy those folks. Trekking poles- BD Ergo Cork - started with my 10 year old BD poles. The tips broke in VA, so I decided to get new ones. The Ergo Cork poles were fine, but straps began to fray within a week. I continued to use them until ME, because the replacement straps they sent were very difficult to replace. Finally in Rangeley, I replaced the tips on the new poles and got some help in getting the replacement straps put on. By the way, the replacement straps are starting to fray. I would probably buy Leki next time. Shoes - 6 pairs - I think shoes are all personal preference. I used Merrill Ventilators, Brooks trail runners and a Merrill trail runner at the end. They all had their advantages and disadvantages. I would probably go with trail runners the entire way, knowing what I know now.  Trail runners are light, even when wet, and they dry quickly. Merrill replaced a couple pair for free when they wore out before 500 miles. Cook system - MSR Pocket Rocket and Dualist cookset. This was a 10 year old stove and it never failed to do the job. light and I had no problem finding the fuel along the way. I pretty much boiled water and ate MH dinners each evening on the trail. My wife gets a great MH discount. I never cooked Rahmen. Sleeping pad - Thermarest Neo X-therm - this thing was great in cold weather and I didn't see any downside when it warmed up a bit. No leaks and it supports side sleeping. Pretty light and packs up pretty small. The noise issue is overblown. Tent - Lightheart Solo - this was an 8 year old tent that uses trekking poles. I didn't tent very many times, but it did fine. Lots of space, but I did notice the foot of my sleeping bag usually had some condensation on it in the morning. This tent is a great all around value. I could get all my gear inside the tent. Sleeping Bags - I started with a 5 degree bag, swapped out to my 20 degree bag at Davenport Gap (too soon), and then used my 40 degree bag from Daleville north, until Hanover, when I got the 20 degree bag back. I think the transition of bags depends on when you start. I started in Feb, and the 5 degree bag gave me confidence, but did take up a lot of space in my bag. I had to use a compression sack on the 5 and 20 degree bags. I only bought one new bag, the 5 degree, for this hike. I had the others. As far as equipment, I think people overthink how important it is. You need the basics and you need to think through what is needed for your schedule and calendar. I don't think anybody's equipment choice made a big difference in whether they made it or not. If you go with heavy equipment, you will pay the price, however. I cannot understand why anyone would be out there with a base weight approaching 30 pounds or greater. Do your homework and give yourself a break. My base weight was around 23 when I started in Feb and got down to around 15 by the time I was in the north.",,View Entry,"Jul 16, Sun",0
Salesman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572325,"When I started out on my AT Thru Hike in February, I gave myself about a 51% chance of finishing. That number seems like a copout, but I had done a lot of research and had hiked about 350 miles of the southern AT in weekend and section hikes over the past decade. I knew what the trail looked like, I knew what it took to move along it and I had made some recoverable mistakes, but I had never spent more than 5 days at a time out there. I also had some physical history, a heart attack at 53 and ACL reconstruction on my right knee a couple decades ago. I felt I needed some mental advantages to help me be successful. I will share some of my strategy in this entry. I do not feel this is the right way or the best way to approach a through hike, just another option for others to consider and tweak as they attempt to beat the ""percentages"". For the first 1500 miles, I treated the thru hike like a series of section hikes. I started out with a focus on the 30 miles to Neel Gap and a reward of hot food and indoor sleeping when I got there. I did not think about anything beyond Neel Gap. When I got to Neel Gap, my focus was on making Dick's Creek Gap and Top of Georgia Hostel. Hot food, a trip into town, a resupply from home and a night sleeping inside were my rewards. I used that approach well into the northeast. Finish one section and focus on the next with a reward at the end of it. I probably took it to the realm of silliness, but I never used the words ""Maine"" or ""Katahdin"" until I got well into the northeast. I was very focused on small sections and did not allow the length of the remaining journey to enter my mind. I relied on mail drops, primarily into hostels, about every 7-10 days from home. My wife got discounts on Mountain House freeze dried dinners and they were my staple choice for hot evening trail meals for the entire hike. She would also put in other food for about 4 days and send me my requests for equipment additions. I supplemented these mail drops with trips into town, primarily to get breakfast and lunch items to round out the menu. I remember my late father telling me that if you ever started having thoughts about quitting anything, you had already quit. I struggled before the hike to find actions that would help me deal with trail depression, hardships and general missing home, before it became a problem. It must have worked.  I never thought about quitting the hike. Not once. I did find that interaction with other hikers was important to me. Not just at night around shelters, but being able to hike with someone else during the day was a huge pick me up in my case. I probably hiked alone about 40% of the hike, but it sure was more enjoyable with someone else. I had some great hiking buddies for extended sections - Lucky Charms, Wiz and Freight Train. Once I started the hike, I felt additional pressure when former co-workers, friends, neighbors and trail journal readers communicated their support and interest in my hike.  Other hikers also commented on this added mental burden to complete the hike. Overall, I was very lucky. At 58 years of age, I did not get injured or even caught a cold during the almost 5 months I was out there. I fell about 20 times, a couple times drawing blood on my head, but fortunately none of my falls were serious. Everyone falls, it is just luck on where you land. I also did not have any knee or leg injuries. Considering I spent the last 36 years in cubicles and offices, my body was good to me. I cannot offer any advice here, other than I did spend quite a bit of time before starting by going on daily, short training hikes around my home. As someone that has been very disciplined about work for decades, I treated hiking the same way. I answered the bell every morning. I did not take a lot of zeroes and treated hiking like getting up and going to work. You just do it. I also hiked within myself, most of the time. My hiking pace was slower than most, but I got up early and generally hiked a ten hour day or so. I also learned that mileage is more related to what the trail gives you, than your own pace. Toward the latter stages of the hike, I became more concerned about injuries that would end my hike and became a bit more cautious in the tougher terrains of NH and ME. To close, thru hiking the AT is a long and arduous journey. Those who say it is easy, have never done it, or are being cavalier with their experience. I would recommend one get exposed to as much information as possible and take some section hikes to test their equipment and their own ""know how"" before setting out. Make mistakes on weekend hikes, when you have a car waiting for you in 10 miles. It was a great adventure.  I can say I really enjoyed the first two thirds of the hike. By the time I reached VT, I was like most other NOBO's, I was ready for it to be over with, but was too invested to not finish. Maine was absolutely the toughest part of the hike. Southern Maine humbled me and challenged me to do things I could not have done in Georgia. I can say that climbing Katahdin was the best day of the entire hike. Not because it was the finish, but because the trail required me to use all of the skills I had acquired over 2185 miles and then some new ones. Scrambling and climbing up the rocks above treeline with numerous exposures was not something I could have done 3 months earlier. When I reached Tableland, a mile and half from the terminus sign, I knew I had it. I cannot begin to convey the sense of joy and accomplishment I had in that last hour or so, as I made my way to Baxter Peak across that most reasonable terrain. I did this hike for myself and to see if I could accept a challenge that most do not succeed AT. I had the bug to thru hike and it wasn't going way until I at least tried to do it. At my age, there are not many things one can do that prove to themselves they still have some grit and toughness left and they are not quite ready for the rocking chair on the porch. I was never lacking for confidence, but this hike was one of the 4 or 5 most notable accomplishments in my life. I am glad I took it on, and fortunate to have been successful.  ",,View Entry,"Jul 17, Mon",0
