Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518473,"I’ve officially begun planning a 2017 thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. This will be my first long distance hike and I’m excited to share my plans and hard work with anyone who reads. My start date will be April 4th, 2017… here we go!Starting off with a bang, I’ve already been able to acquire my first bits of gear. Backcountry was offering a great sale on several items that I couldn’t pass up. Those first purchases have cemented the fact that the trail is truly happening. I’ve been working tirelessly to perfect (to the best of my ability) my gear list.Lots of time has been spent researching new backpacks in search of a lighter one that will suit my needs perfectly. Along with the debate of rain cover // no rain cover, I’ve decided to forgo the cover for now and line my bag instead. Finally, some gear bits will be purchased as I get the money whereas some will be purchased at pre-determined times later in the year.Mustang xx",,1 year & 5 months,"Nov 04, Wed",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518479,"I have spent the last month updating and lowering my pack weight for winter/summer; the lists will continue to be updated as I make changes. My goal is to keep the winter weight under 20 pounds and summer under 17 pounds.Have a five day shakedown hike set for late June at Devil’s Lake State Park in Wisconsin. It’s not crazy tough, but it’s the best I have around to practice. I will have most of my gear to use for practice and will allow me plenty of time to weight train.Have enough saved for my backpack, the ULA Circuit. The limit on the pack is roughly 35 pounds, which I feel is a good goal to stay under. I know you’re supposed to select a pack based on your finished weight, but if I don’t set a limit, I may end up with 300 pounds of stuff. Furthermore, I’ve purchased a bit more than planned due to holiday sales but it was all well worth it!Mustang xx",,1 year & 4 months,"Dec 04, Fri",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518751,"More gear purchased this past month! Received some gifts and cash for Christmas that I will put towards my savings for hiking clothes to lessen the impact it will have later.Strength and flexibility conditioning will begin in February and practice hikes will begin in late March. Final dates decided for a lot of things in the coming months…1. Backpack to be purchased in March2. Clothing to be purchased in March3. Food to be purchased in July/August4. Other items to be purchased in JanuaryFinally, my birthday is this month! I will be turning 19 on January 15th!Mustang xx",,1 year & 3 months,"Jan 04, Mon",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521237,"I have not bought any new gear this month as I’ve had a bad cold and missed a few work days leading to smaller amounts of money being put towards the trail. With winter coming to a slow end here in the Upper Midwest, this should not be a problem for much longer.I’ve decided that instead of just posting a big block summary of everything I can remember from the past month, I will break it into four updates. That way anyone who reads this can feel more included and see a more in-depth account of any planning (or rambling). Updates will still come monthly.I will be making some large purchases in March to get the bulk of remaining gear. By getting it all now, it allows for plenty of time to train and practice loading/unloading my backpack.I’ve registered for a class at REI where we will be discussing various equipment and food details for an AT thru-hike. More to come on that next entry.Training is off to a slow start as I’m having a hard time balancing work and school. Hopefully I will be able to work something out in the next month that will allow me to get started.Mustang xx",,1 year & 2 months,"Feb 04, Thu",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522857,"I’ve purchased my warm weather sleeping bag, backpack, and most of my clothing items. They will be arriving in the coming weeks. Training is still off to a slow start but I’m attempting to get it into motion this month.The REI class I took was fun and informative but nothing I hadn’t really thought about myself. I enjoyed hearing other people’s positions on gear and food selection. Only myself and one other lady were planning thru-hikes (she left March 4th).After much thought and reading, I’ve decided that if I come upon any blue blazes that interest me, I will attempt to go down them (even if I may miss a mile or two of white blazes). This was a ‘hard’ choice as I considered myself a purist but missing stunning sights seems like a poor choice.Lots of consideration going into how I will work with the bubble around my start time. Have some ideas but will continue to think and read journals of those starting to get a feel for how busy it is.Mustang xx",,1 year & 1 month,"Mar 04, Fri",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523050,"Update 1 - 12 months & 3 weeksFinishing up on purchases this month and will be starting the savings fund for food. Exciting that I've come so far and I've learned so much and yet I still have so much more to learn and discover. Some new plans may switch up my summer and I might potentially lose my shakedown hike... I will talk more on this if it goes through.Update 2 – 12 months & 2 weeksTomorrow will mark the end of gear purchases… I can’t believe I’ve been planning that long to have reached this point. My shakedown hike is still in question at the moment and hope to have a definite yes or no on that shortly. My next goal is to save towards my food fund as I plan to have dehydrated meals as the bulk of my food and then use towns for snacks and lunch. However, this means I won’t have much to update on in the future so expect shorter entries.Update 3 – 12 months & 1 weekI’ve got some money into the food funds already… hopefully it doesn’t feel like it’ll take forever but it should help time to past faster. I’ve begun walking for the hike now and am excited that it’s finally nice enough to get outside and train. Walked about four miles with a roughly 18-20 pound pack on… relatively easy hike but was quite pretty and I enjoyed it. It’s close to my house so I think it’ll be nice to go once or twice a week as it has three loops (3.7 miles, 3.2 miles, and 2 miles) that are all connected.Update 4 – 12 monthsFood fund is over 50% completed. Unfortunately this week’s practice hike may be cancelled as my car has been acting up and I don’t want to risk driving to the park only to become stuck there… (at least I’d have the gear to live for a little bit). Think I may end up buying a pack cover… I can’t decide. If anyone has thoughts on that, leave a comment in the guestbook. Think my shakedown hike is still a go, as I haven’t heard anything about the possible job. Once April ends, I’ll know for sure… If I do end up hiking, I’ll add some pictures under the photo tab!Mustang xx",,12 months,"Apr 04, Mon",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528021,"Update 1 – 11 months & 3 weeksWent hiking twice this past week... did about six miles altogether with roughly 20 lbs in my backpack. Plan to continue going twice a week until school ends, then I will increase to three times per week. More photos under the photo tab. Finally, I'm about half way through the food supply fund... so that should be done sometime in June!Update 2 – 11 months & 2 weeksI'm continuing to train once or twice a week with roughly 20 lbs & hope to up mileage to four miles per hike. Still working towards food savings fund. I've also worked to create a rough budget book towards each category (lodging, postage, ect…) and made a very rough outline of how long it would take me to complete the trail. It turned out to be a lot longer than I wanted… so may need to work on that.Update 3 - 11 months & 1 weekTraining was quite rough this week as I did not get out very often. Next week will be better... especially with the fact school ends in about two weeks. To continually further my training I will most likely add about two more miles every two weeks or as soon as I feel comfortable. My goal is to successfully be able to hike 18 miles in a single go. Secondly, my outline I made for time expectations on the trail will be left alone for the time being, as I'm okay with it for now.Update 4 - 11 monthsContinuing to train at least two times a week, if not more. I aim for about 4.5 miles per go and sometimes I make it, sometimes I don't. I hope to be doing around 9 miles per hike by the time I go for my five day shakedown hike as the trails are of much harder difficulty. It will be nice knowing that the months to my hike are in the single digits... makes it seem a little bit closer even though it seems so far away. Lastly, I reserved my room at the Lodge at the park... went for a 'Loft Room,' which has two beds and a bed up a 10 ft ladder to a loft located on the top floor of the lodge with pretty views... I couldn't resist it.Mustang xx",,11 months,"May 04, Wed",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533645,"Update 1 - 10 months & 3 weeksNot much to update here... I go out hiking three or four times per week average about 3-4 miles per trip. My goal is to hit 9 miles by the end of June for when I go on my shakedown hike. Being in the single digit months really makes this whole adventure seem all the more surreal and obtainable, however, I still have a ways to go... so let the race to the start line begin.Update 2 - 10 months & 2 weeksI cannot believe that time is going as fast as it is. I feel like every time I blink a month passes... this is not a bad thing but it's crazy because I can feel that my start date is going to be here so quickly. On the topic of training, I've worked out a game plan and am putting that into work now. My shakedown hike is under a month away (exciting) but continues to prove my feeling that time will fly. Cannot wait for this all to begin...Update 3 - 10 months & 1 weekAnother week down, another week closer. More saving, saving, saving... what else is there to do? Training is coming along and my practice hike starts June 20th. Doing a lot of remedial work to continue to balance and smooth out kinks for the trail.Update 4 - 10 monthsJust keep swimming... it'll be here soon. Just a few weeks off from my shakedown hike. I can't wait! It will be meant for practice but also as a vacation, so it won't be to hard of a trip. More food to be purchased shortly.Mustang xx",,10 months,"Jun 04, Sat",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538453,"Update 1 - 9 months & 3 weeksLast of my bulk food has been purchased, now it's onto saving for everything else! My practice hike starts Monday so next weeks update will come a few days late and will cover the trip. It won't be posted on here directly but will be readable on my other blog due to length. Exciting!Update 2 - 9 months & 2 weeksSee my hike (link) below...Update 3 - 9 months & 1 weekTraining is back full swing. I need to get the mileage up well also adding more weight to my pack so I don't adjust to only carrying 20 lbs when it'll sit closer to 30-32 lbs.Mustang xxhttps://trailmustang.wordpress.com/2016/06/25/5-day-vacationshakedown-hike/",,9 months,"Jul 04, Mon",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542785,Update 1 - 8 monthsNothing crazy happened this month. It went by as quickly as the rest. My excitement continues to grow!Mustang xx,,8 months,"Aug 04, Thu",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548088,Update 1 - 7 monthsSorry for no other updates this month! Not a lot has been going down so I didn't feel it was needed. Hiking is going good and I hope that with my lack of hilly training grounds I'll be able to adapt to the trail quickly. Summer is tapering off to its end here and fall is starting to creep up... ready for the cooler weather but not snow. Let's hope these final six months go as quick as the rest. It'll be a lot of saving for on-trail expenses and training and I know that before I can blink I'll be standing at the bottom of the approach trail.Mustang xx,,7 months,"Sep 04, Sun",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550184,"Update 1 - 6 monthsThe trail is growing ever closer and my excitement is increasing way too fast for the amount of time left until I begin it. I watch Instagram for recent photos and check into other's blogs on occasion... I find the less I read, the faster time goes (which is a battle sometimes). My training is going strong and I'm adding in additional time at the gym doing whatever I can to try and strengthen myself for the mountains that will become my home. I would also like to thank any of the hikers that have given me tips and advice, it's all appreciated! Here goes to another month... another month closer.Mustang xx",,6 months,"Oct 04, Tue",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551320,"Update 1 - 5 monthsWow... another month closer. I can't believe how close the trail really is now. Even more so for those early January hikers... Not to much to update on again since it has just been a training month however I have been doing research (as always) on gear I want in the future. I absolutely love a ton of the ZPacks products and eventually hope to switch over most of my gear to their items. The Altaplex tent and the Arc Haul are great gear selections, just really expensive ones so that will likely NOT be used on this thru-hike attempt. Talk to y'all next month!Mustang xx",,5 months,"Nov 04, Fri",0
Mustang,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552257,"I will no longer be super active here - you can find me @ http://Postholer.Com/TrailMustangUpdate 1 - 4 monthsHey guys! Wow, I can't believe it's three months until I get to step foot on the trail for the first time. I've made a couple changes to my gear list and other things. A few things in relation to clothing and little things but I'm pretty happen with where it currently stands. I've also decided that I will likely be vlogging my time on the trail which will be a fun and surely difficult experience. Another big change is that I will be hiking the Approach Trail the day before I start and then start officially at Springer the next morning. My family will be driving me down and we will spend the night at the Lodge. Once school gets out next week I will begin my final crackdown on training (all indoors now) and just hope for the best. I will do this!Mustang xx",,4 months,"Dec 04, Sun",0
