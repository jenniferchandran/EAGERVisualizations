We liked it so much that we didn't want to leave so we slack packed so we could come back. It was amazing.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574883,"Today we hiked the bigelows it was very beautiful at the peaks. We are splitting it up in two days, but I think that I could have hiked it in one day, because I wasn't tired when we got to our campsite, but our campsite was very beautiful we had a platform so that was a great blessing and our water source was amazing. It was a spring and it was almost like it came right out of the fridge and it tasted so good. :)","

The people are very nice and friendly ecspecially a guy named Tree hugger ,he shuttled us in and out of town ,and played card games with me. My favorite part was probably eating dinner, we ate at the white wolf and there food was amazing.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575546,"We hiked the saddleback mountains today. I especially like it when we climbed huge slabs of rock, right by waterfalls and how we were exposed above treeline for over three miles. At the top of the mountain the view was amazing and it was so windy that the wind blew of the sign that told us the elevation of how high we were off the wooden post which was crazy ,and Starshine was leaning forward and was not falling because the wind blew her really hard.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575547,"Yesterday we hiked two miles from the lean to to get to the farm house so when we got to the highway parking lot we had no cell crevice so we couldn't contact the shuttle so we were about ready to put our thumbs up but then a trail angel offered us a ride to the farm house ,and her name was sister bear. So that was a big blessing.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575846,Today we stayed at the farm house and it was really nice and the people were friendly and there were kids so Izzy had really fun. We took a zero day so we got to get to know the town and we ate a this place called the red onion it was almost like a American Italian restaurant and it was really good I had pizza and chilli I know it's a weird combo but I was craving both and was surprisingly good. Then when we went back to our room we got ready to hike tomorrow and I was so tired and ready to go to sleep.,"

It was very pretty we stopped at a waterfall to eat lunch and it was amazing. We went uphill for a while to get to a shelter called the bemis mountain leanto, and it was my first time sleeping in a leanto and it was quite nice because my mom were way ahead and after setting everything uP we didn't know what to do so it sportive felt like a zero day. And we didn't have to take our tent Down so it was really nice. That was my first leanto expirience.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576758,"Today we did the mahoosuc notch and the mahoosuc arm. We slaked packed ,which means we only carried enough stuff for one day so our packs were way lighter except for izzys. The notch was like a rock jungle gym. When I first saw the boulders I had no clue how I was going to do this ,because they were just so big and steep ,but once I started climbing I thought it was really fun. Sometimes we had to take of our backpacks and go under boulders and drag them through and papa bear spotted ice so I walked back to him and saw the ice block it was really cool [: . The notch took us about 2 1/2 hours but it was so much fun I wanted to do it again. Papa bear had a banana in his pocket during the notch because he had forgot about it and at the end it was like banana pie filling. and then the arm was a lot of rock slabs and some boulders but we were going up into higher altitude but it wasn't as hard. We stayed at this really nice lean to and it had a cooking area ,so that was cool. Good night","

As soon as we got to New Hampshire we had to go down a slab of rock and there was mounds of mud and papa bear said welcome to New Hampshire ,we all laughed. The need day we hiked seven miles to town we could tell we were close to town when we started to smell the good scent of laundry soap on every body that walks up so our noses are our gps.","

It's been a week so I didn't know how I was going to do and it was rainy and we were doing slabs of rock so it was slippery. I slipped and fell head first over the treeline with my head hanging, then my moms instant reaction was go and save him well she did . She had to scrape up her hands by rubbing them in the rock to stop herself from killing me by pushing me off the mountain. Well that was my first day back on the trail in a week.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578824,"today we hiked to zealand hut, our goal was to get to a campsite a little further to a stealth site but when we got to the hut we took of our shoes, sat and ate a bowl of soup and we found out that they were shooting a tv show so we had to wait outside and we were waiting on the bench deciding if we were going to hike further to the tenting spot and then a trail runner came and started talking to me and I had asked him how many miles he had done and he showed me on the map that he had done 25 miles and he asked me and I said that I was actually a thru hiker and he was so impressed and was like k Mr humble that's crazy, I'm just training for the pct . So then we talked and i found out his name was Justin. so we ended up working for stay and played in the water and had stuffed shells and it was really good , but i had a rough nights sleep and went to sleep at 10 so i was tired.                            lightning bug","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578426,"Today we hiked from the Zealand falls hut to the Galehead hut it was 7 miles and we hiked 8 miles the day before so I was beat and I didn't fell so good the day before + we did work for stay so we didn't get to go to bed until 10:00 and my nose was runny so it was real hard to get a good sleep. I woke up at 3:00 cause I was restless and then I went outside and papa bear set up my stuff and went to sleep better. We did south twin mountain it was a pretty good hike when we went down it it was tough because me and my dad stopped when he had service to watch the highlights of the Chiefs game , during that it started drizzling and we ha a steep down hill with slabs of rocks and they were slick so we fell a few times and it hurt our knees. Then when I saw the hut I was happy but it was very deceitful and I was running but it was still really far away. The hut was really nice it was almost like a home but not a home in the same way it was really cool the workers there were called the croo they were really friendly. It was cool because you get to sleep above treeline and watch the stars at night. Since I woke up at 3:00 I looked at the star and saw a shooting star/ dead star,so that was cool. Over all it was a good day.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580151,"Hello just got out of Vermont we are now in The middle of Massachusetts. Going to try to finish up Massachusetts next week then we're going to be in Connecticut. When we were in Vermont our friend Justin hiked up the trail and met us when we were near Bennington. He lives in Brattleboro so we got to stay with him and his roommate Courtney, they made a really good fillet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus it was really good. We had lots of fun and played games together on the Xbox and stayed up till like two in the morning. So we took a zero day the next day and went to this coffee shop called mocha Joe's and they had a really good hot chocolate and maple latte made with real maple syrup. I had lots of fun. Two days ago it was Starshines birthday and we went into town and had some crepes ,we walked around but there wasn't really anything fun to do, so we came back to the hotel and found that a big birthday present shipped to us from home from all her friends ,it was like a party in a box. It was such a fun surprise. She loved everything that's was in there it was like a party in a box. Justin also drove out here to see Starshine for her birthday. We had dinner at a sushi ,hibachi restaurant and it was really good. Today we are either going to stay one more night and get an early start ,or leave in the afternoon. I can't wait to see the Cookie lady.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580302,"Today we didn't get an early start but we had to go out on the trail so we got dropped off at Washington mountain road right by the cookie lady's house and I was so excited to see her and eat a delicious cookie ,but she wasn't there and I was so sad. So we walked to the next shelter and the terrain of the trail was nice because it was tiny hills the whole way, so that was kinda nice. When me and Starshine started"" singing we are at the shelter , and we are at the shelter ,we are at the shelter. "" I was thinking I can't wait to make a fire ,eat and sleep. So we got here and we met two other so is who's names were Tomcat and super tramp they were nice ,and had gathered wood before it rained so we had a lots of wood and made a nice fire. For dinner I ate shepherds potato stew with vegetables. It was really good. And we put all of our other food in the bear box and had a little conversation around the campfire,now I am going to go to bed. The end","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580303,"Today it was super warm when we woke up so it was much easier to get up which was nice. I forgot to buy breakfast, so I ate a bbq beef stick, which gave me some gas to power me up the mountain. It was a little more uphill than yesterday so that through me of a little bit. The shelter we were going to was like a cabin but it was closed for the season, but you could still sleep in the enclosed porch which is what I wanted to do but everybody else wanted to stay at this lodge .1 off the trail. so after we discussed we decided that the lodge was our best option. So we crossed the highway and went to the lodge and it was actually pretty nice. We had pizza delivered to us for dinner. It was really good. Then we watched Thor. We went to bed around 9:00.","

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580304,I am really happy that we stayed in the lodge last night because the breakfast that they had was fruit and muffins so we took a muffin in our backpacks and at our two mile mark me and Starshine split it and it tasted like a chocolate cake. It was really good. The terrain was a lot of marshes and going through cow pastures and over barbed wire. When we were walking through the pasture I fell and I got up so fast because I thought I fell in a cow in a patty and that would've been really bad because there was this one time I set my backpack down on the ground and it landed on dog poop and I didn't realize that until it got all over my clothes and it was nasty. We stayed at this campsite called shaker campsite. Tomcat was there and two other guys to. It was pretty cool.,"

Lightning Bug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580305,We started a a campsite called shaker campsite today. There were a lot of bog bridges and they were wet from the day before and we went up this straight up this slick wood bridge and my mom and dad slipped into the marsh and mama pajama got soaked and I helped them up. We saw cat footprints and saw the bees nest that a bear had pushed down. I was by myself when I saw that and I was on top of the mountain and heard sticks snapping so I thought oh shoot is that a bear and waited there until the rest of the fam got there. It wasn't a bear it was just a squirrel that fell from a tree. Towards the end of our day when we passed this nice Brooke we saw a nice big trout in there so we stopped and filled up our water bladders and we met this guy named Tom cat and he filtered for us because our filter broke. When we got to the shelter they had the old one and the new one we stayed in the old one because there we already people in the new one. We had a big fire so I Cooked some tortillas an they were so good. Goodnight,"
