Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/368120,"Well, here I am again. Looking forward to my next big section hike of the AT. I will be starting sometime between September and November 2012. I plan on doing 210-280 miles in 14 days starting from Dick's Creek Gap in Hiawassee, GA and ending somewhere in Tennessee. I am starting the training now. A friend of mine is planning on going with me. He is starting his prep now also. I have already decided on some gear changes and started purchasing. I am listing them in my gear section. I will write as I can on my preparation.",,First Entry,"Feb 28, Tue",0
Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/370139,I am really excited. I am already doing massive planning for this hike. I am keeping busy buying new gear to lighten my load. I am currently serving in Afghanistan so this journal and planning my trip is keeping me sane right now...,,View Entry,"Feb 29, Wed",0

We are still in the early planning phases but we will see how it will all shake out. I have purchased some new equipment for this hike. I have added it to my planned gear list and updated the pictures. It is still a work in progress so bear with me. I am so excited I can't wait!",,I can't wait,"Mar 21, Wed",0
Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/371499,"Training has started for the trail. The goal now is a minimum of 300 miles in 21 days. Maximum is trying to reach the Virginia Border. Training is key to this planning. That would mean averaging 19-20 miles a day. I have 5 months to prepare so I think this is attainable. Another friend is thinking about going. Right now it looks like Beau, Lope, Rosson and myself (maybe Lope's wife) are on the list. This morning I ran 3.5 miles in 33 minutes at 5000ft elevation. I plan to start walking with a pack more and continuing to hit the gym. I have purchased most of my gear. I still lack my waterproof/breathable jacket and trail shoes. I will be buying the jacket around July and the shoes right before I hit the trail. My gear has changed considerably this year. My old gear list is under my old trail name (Facetious (2011) - on the option menu on the left if you would like to compare). I have strived to get some lighter equipment. My gear list is dependant on when I can actually hit the trail. The range is between September to November. If it is September I may drop a few things out but towards November I don't want to take any chances. Let me know what you think?",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Mon",0
Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/371911,"It looks like the list of people has changed again. Beau, Lope and I are definitely going. Rosson and Penny are still hopefuls but it looks like that is the list for now. I can't wait. Beau, Lope and I did a practice hike this morning of 5 miles with packs. Everything is on track so far. I changed all my bags out for Cuban Fiber. My base weight right now is around 15 pounds. Not bad for a winter weight for me (I know I could go lighter if I had to). I still have a short list of stuff I want to buy before my hike. I really hope I get to go in September. I will be going regardless of when I get home. My 11 year old Son may be doing the first day with us. That would be fun. That's all for now...",,View Entry,"Apr 05, Thu",0
Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/373352,"I am looking at changing cameras. I think waterproof and shockproof may be a good idea. I am looking at a Fuji model. The XP20 (14 MP) to be more precise. I think I can get a pretty good deal on one. 
Looks like the list of people going is now down to Beau, Lope and I (maybe Rosson too). I am sure it will continue to evolve. 
More preperation has been done. Hiked a mountain in Surobi with combat gear for fun and ran 5 miles this morning. When I actually get back on the trail it will be surreal!",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Sun",0
Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/377166,"Well, I am still here in Afghanistan. Doing as much prep as I can from here. I am always thinking about ways to lighten my pack. I like my creature comforts so I can't imagine that I will ever get down under 10 lbs (except for maybe summer). One of the ideas I have been thinking about is I usually carry 1 more full meal when I am hiking than what I am expecting to eat. I have been doing this for safety reasons. I am now rethinking this and may begin to just carry 2 small pouches of Lipton soup as a light weight alternative. Let me know what you guys think of this? I have put up a pretty comprehensive list of gear with pictures. I would also be interested to hear your opinions of my gear including ways to shave weight. Every time I think I am as light as I can go I think of another way to lighten it some more. Right now I have my base pack weight down to right at 15 lbs with about 4 pounds of clothing worn (including hiking poles and shoes). It looks like for family reasons I may shorten my hike back to 14 days. The plan is constantly evolving. This would still put me through the Smokies which is my goal for this hike. It is still Lope, Simmons and myself going. Lopez said his wife is seriously considering it again. I haven't heard from Rosson if he is still going or not. In the end it doesn't matter to me. I will go all by myself if need be. It would be fun to go in a group but isn't necessary. I can't wait!",,Me again...,"May 09, Wed",0
Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/386847,Still in the Stan. Updated my gear entries with a few last minute changes. The clock is ticking!!! I can't wait. It may be down to me and Beau now. Lopes is still hanging on. We will see what happens. The plan is back to 2 weeks through the Smokies starting at the GA/NC border. I can't wait. I have my meal plan and resupply planned. The plans are becoming finalized. It is almost time!!!,,View Entry,"Jul 20, Fri",0
Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/387038,"Let me clearify a few things. First I have purchased all equipment except my shoes. I will buy those and make sure they are broken in right before the hike. I am looking at the Inov-8 X-Talon 212. I have heard good things about them and figure I may give them a try. I have purchased some of my food. I am going with Mountain House Pro-Packs and Packit Gourmet meals for some of my dinners. I have a full list of groceries to buy right before I leave. The trail has pretty much been planned and everything is as ready as I can get it from here (Afghanistan). I have detailed spreadsheets with everything that needs to be done as soon as I get home. It is settling into the 14 days of hiking starting at Dick's Creek Gap Hiawassee, GA and hiking through the Great Smokie Mountains National Park. Hopefully starting in mid September. The temps look like they will be between 70-80 during the day and cool at night. Taking a minimum amount of cold weather clothing for elevation. I am so pumped. Enough for now. I will write more soon...",,Time is dragging...,"Jul 21, Sat",0
Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394193,I got to the trailhead at Dick's Creek Gap around 9 am. I was waiting for Beaux to show up when he called and said he was still an hour away. I made a few gear videos at one of the picnic tables and then repacked my food and backpack while I waited. Beaux finally arrived and we got started a little after noon. We started North Bound from Dick's Creek Gap at Hiawassee which is where I ended my last section hike of Georgia (6 days North Bound from Springer to Dick's Creek Gap in 2010). The climb was steeper than I remember. Funny what your memory does to things. We crossed over the Georgia/North Carolina in roughly 9 miles. We stopped and took pictures at the sign and then took pictures of the bent tree just into North Carolina. We easily made it to Muskrat Creek Shelter and decided to call it an early day and started to get settled in. Muskrat Creek Shelter is pretty run down. I would not recommend staying there unless you have to. It was quiet though and we decided to bear hang our food bags more for the practice (there were no bear poles at this shelter) than anything else. We ate dinner and turned in for the night. This reminded me of how tired you get every day and how a good night sleep can change things for you.,"Dick's Creek Gap, Hiawassee

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394235,"Beaux and myself left Muskrat Creek Shelter around 7:30 am hoping to make up the miles we were short the day before. The terrain was a little easier so we made good time today. We passed Standing Indian Shelter (our intended shelter the night before). I was so tired I did not even go check it out. We had a good day though and decided to continue on to Big Spring Shelter to make up for a few miles. Albert Mountain was more than I expected! It is straight up and became a crawl up on hands and feet up the mountain. I should have known when I saw the bypass trail. I was exhausted when we reached the top! We got to the Fire Tower and decided to climb it to take pictures. We were disappointed when the top was locked but we got some great pictures anyway! We then limped towards camp, both exhausted. We agreed to stay in the shelter to ease the camp chores at the end of the day. When we got to the Big Springs Shelter we found only 2 guys already there. Unfortunately hey had already set up their tents in the shelter and pretty much had taken up ALL the space. Beaux and I set up our tents, cooked dinner and turned in for the night.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394253,Beaux and I got an early start again around 8:15 on the trail. We agreed to do around 15 miles today after yesterdays climb of Albert Mountain. Once out on the trail we took a rest stop at Siler Bald Shelter. There is a sign there warning of an 8 foot black snake in the rafters. I looked but I didn't see the snake. When we left the shelter we ran into a guy going Southbound on the trail that asked if we could take a dog he found down to Wayah Gap Rd and give it to the owner. He said he had called her but was going in the wrong direction to deliver the dog. Beaux and I agreed to do so. We walked the dog down to the roadway. We waited for a time and then called the phone number on the dogs collar. At first I got a ring no answer. I called back and the owner answered but said she wasn't on the way. She said it was too far and she was trying to have a friend come and pick the dog up. She told us she would call the friend and then call us back. We waited about an hour or so and called the number back. There was no answer on the phone. By this time it was starting to get dark and I needed to get water. We left and headed Northbound and could not get the dog to remain there. The next 2 listed water sources were dry so we ended up going much further than intended. We finally found water at a campsite near the Bartram Trail about 3 miles South of the Wayah Bald Shelter. As we started to set up our tents it began to pour down rain! I quickly set my tent up and began to dry up the inside. I looked over at Beaux and he looked like he was already in his tent. I buttoned up for the night and hoped it would clear by in the morning. Amazingly I slept dry and warm. My legs are finally kicking in.,"Big Spring Shelter

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394254,"I woke up this morning and could still hear the rain beating on the fly of my tent. I unzipped the screen and then unzipped the fly and was amazed to see the dog sitting in front of my tent soaking wet! He had slept right in front of the tent fly all night long. I packed everything up into my pack inside the tent and then I got on my rain jacket and pants and got out my umbrella. I stepped out of the tent and I noticed the dog had gotten into my trash bag. I picked it up and then went to Beaux to see how he was doing. His fly on his tent was not fully pitched and the bottom (the foot) of his tent still had mesh showing allowing water to run into his tent. He said he was completely wet and wanted to wait until it stopped raining to move on. I got my camera and headed back down the trail to see and take pictures of the historical landmark listed in the guide book about a mile and a half back down the trail on a short .2 mile side trail. WIthout my pack I moved very quickly back to this site. The blue blazed trail was short and ended at a road. Across the road was the first ranger station in Nantahala. I took several pictures and realized the dog had followed me to this location. I even took pictures of the outhouse that accompanied the main house. I returned up the trail and back to camp. When I arrived the rain slowed and then stopped. Beaux climbed out of his tent. He said he had a horrible night and needed to take a zero day to dry his clothes and sleeping bag. We discussed options and he decided to stay at the campsite and explore for a few days and possibly try to go into the city of Franklin. I packed up my tent and headed North down the trail. I stopped by Wayah Bald and took pictures of the tower and tried to take pics from the tower. It of course was very foggy and not much to look at (at the time). I then pressed on to the Wayah Bald shelter. There I met 2 guys already in the shelter. I ate a quick snack and decided to move on to the next shelter. As I began to move out one of the guys informed me the next shelter had been closed for renovation. After looking at the time and options I decided to stay at this shelter and try to dry my equipment. We built a fire and the 2 guys dried their boots. A guy stopped in the shelter and said he was going to take a short break and head on to the next one. He said his trail name was ""Shiva"". He was trying to hike as far North as possible as late in the season would let him. He had started at Springer Mountain Georgia. I told him the next shelter may be closed and he said he would head for the one after that one. He asked if we had seen a girl pass by and I told him we hadn't. He then left. I settled into the shelter with my stuff spread out all over to help dry it the best it could. After dark I saw a headlamp headed toward the shelter. The dog ran out to greet them. It was the girl that Shiva had asked about. She had gotten onto the wrong trail and had to walk a total of 25 miles that day to get to us. She asked how far the next shelter was and I told her it was closed. She set up her tent outside the shelter and we all went to sleep.","Campsite near Bartram Trail to the West

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394258,"I woke up, got packed up and readied for the trip into the NOC. I ate quickly. Janna, the girl who came in late was ready to leave also. We left the shelter and said goodbye to the 2 guys in the shelter. We made time quickly. It was pretty flat for most of the way with a few climbs and descents with good views. We stopped and snacked for lunch. We made it into the NOC around 2:30 pm with the dog in tow. When I crossed the street to the NOC I saw Shiva on a bench next to the river. We all crossed and got rooms at the hostel. When I came out I noticed the dog was missing. Once we settled into the hostel we all took showers and changed into our cleanest clothes. As I walked back to get my resupply parcel from the outfitter I noticed one of the employees had the dog. She said they had called the owner and if it didn't work out one of them would give the dog a good home. I was glad to hear that. I knew I couldn't take the dog through the Smokies. At least he was well taken care of. Afterwards I met up with Shiva and Janna and we went to the local diner and ate dinner. After dinner we went to get our clothes and take them to do laundry. As we walked to the laundry Shiva said he was thinking about eating again at the diner and I had been thinking the exact same thing! When we arrived at the laundry Janna said the same thing so while we waited on our clothes we walked back across the street and ate another course! On the walk back after dinner I noticed a headlamp coming down the trail from the mountain. Shiva said the hikers would be very upset when they got down because the hostel had closed for the night and the diner had just closed. We decided to wait for the hikers. When they arrived it was the 2 from Wayah Bald Shelter! They had force marched in. They were both completely worn out. They said it was the first leg over 15 miles they had ever done! I was impressed! They were a little upset the stores were closed although I think they were most upset they couldn't get a beer. We all went back over to the hostel and I laid all my equipment out in the hostel to dry and went to bed. I was so tired I didn't even unbox my resupply.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394259,"We all left the NOC around noon. Shiva and Janna led the way out and were soon gone. I apparently had developed some bad blisters on the back my right foot. I stopped most of the way up the first hill and did some blister care. The 2 guys that made it in late caught up to me. One was having issues with his knee. I moved out much slower than before. It seemed like it took forever to get to the first shelter. I got water there and ate lunch around 2pm. I moved much faster once I left the first shelter. I made it to some switch backs that had huge rocks dispersed sporadically down the slope. I slipped and fell on one set. I realized late I wasn't going to make my intended shelter before dark. I tried to pick up the pace. I made it to Jacob's Ladder right at dusk. I was not prepared for the climb. It was brutal at the end of my day. 3/4 of the way up I was wiped out. Two Australian girls passed me going down and told me I was .3 from the top and the shelter was a short .2 from there. That was the longest .3 I have ever been on. I was lucky enough that I got to the top just as it really got dark. I hiked in the dark for more than .2 miles. I began to get concerned that I missed the shelter sign. I dug my headlamp out of my pack and decided to keep pushing forward. I hiked another .2 miles and I saw the shelter sign. I was VERY happy. I turned off my headlamp and headed down the shelter trail. Shiva was at the shelter when I got there. He said I scared him to death because he saw my headlamp on the trail he started calling out to me. I didn't respond and when he called out again I shut my headlamp off. when He thought I was coming to get him like in some ""B"" horror movie. I laughed and explained I never heard him and only turned my headlamp out to save battery. We laughed and stayed up late laughing and reminiscing about the Dave Chapelle Show. There was a mouse that kept running around in the shelter.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394260,We woke up early and set out for Fontana Dam. The patching on my blisters on my right heal held up but today I noticed my left ankle is hurting. I took it slow and Shiva went on ahead. I ran into him at a shelter. We sat while I ate lunch and got water. I left and he decided to stay behind. After a short time he caught up with me on the trail. As we neared Fontana Dam he moved on ahead. I made it into Fontana Dam around 3 pm. I watched the backpacks and Shiva caught a shuttle into town. He came back with 2 hotdogs for me. Those were the best hotdogs EVER (lol)! It is hard to believe I am at the beginning of the Great Smoky Mountains! I walked down and soaked my feet in the cold water. I came back up and made dinner and prepared for bed. Around 10 pm more people showed up and the shelter filled up. I am praying my ankle holds up.,"Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394261,"My ankle REALLY gave me problems today. I decided to just keep pressing on. I hiked the entire day alone. When I got to ""the Throne"" I heard a commotion behind me on my right and saw the tail end of a small bear running away from me. He was WAY to fast for me to get my camera out. I pressed on to Millies Ridge Shelter. I got there kind of early and decided to eat lunch and press on to the next shelter. I met a guy in the shelter who said the rangers told him there was a lot of bear activity between Millies Ridge and the next shelter. As I made my way about 200 yards from the shelter I heard a bear breaking branches as he ran away. I only caught a small glimpse of him. I noticed a large amount of bear scat on the trail. There was a large pile every 75 yards or so. As I neared the second shelter I passed a Southbound thru-hiker named Daniel who warned me he saw a bear near the shelter. The shelter was empty when I arrived. I decided to push on to the next shelter which was Spence Field. There was hardly any scat between the last shelter and this one which obviously made me feel better. When I made my way into the shelter I was greeted by Shiva! I figured he had went past this one. I quickly ate dinner but was informed there was no water at this shelter. Luckily a weekend hiker graciously offered me some. He said he had been hiking the Smokies all his life.There were several other weekend hikers in the shelter. Afterwards I hoisted my food up the bear cable and tucked in for the night.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394262,"I rose early but was slow moving with my ankle. I noticed my ankle was swelling quite a bit. As I hiked my shoe laces began to cut off the circulation. I had to loosen them. Early into the hiking Shiva was right behind me and said ""bear!"". I was looking long but quickly realized the bear was about 15 yards in front of me to my left! He was moving right towards the trail in front of me. He saw me and there ws a moment of us just staring at each other. He then turned and ran away. Shiva and I were talking about it when I noticed a bear ahead in the trail about 50 yards downhill. I tried to get my camera out but he ran away before I could even get it turned on. We continued hiking. The views were awesome but It seemed like forever to get to the shelter. When I arrived at the shelter there were already 2 guys there. It was still early and I wasn't sure what to do with myself. I ate dinner. I built a fire. Shiva tried to call a friend so that he could get picked up in New Found Gap. He planned to get off the trail tomorrow and take a few days and spend it with his friends. He suddenly got the idea he could get picked up from Clingmans Dome tonight. He left the shelter determined he would hike to the dome and his friend would pick him up. I decided to wait and hike to New Found Gap the next day. I had been warned there was a loud squirrel at this shelter. When I arrived I was greeted by a very angry chipmunk who was very upset I was sleeping near his nest in the shelter. I plugged his entry hole and this seemed to quiet him for the night.

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394263,I awoke and unplugged the chipmunks hole. I ate breakfast quickly and set out for the short trip to New Found Gap. I was doing what I always do which is look for landmarks to tell me how far I have gone. I was looking for a shelter so I could eat lunch at it when I saw a sign pointing towards another trail with the shelter sign on it. I assumed this was the AT and followed it. When I got to the shelter it had a sign saying it was .4 miles from the trail and I didn't want to go that far just to eat lunch. I hiked past the shelter trail noting I has just under 5 miles to go to New Found Gap. I saw a sign that had the name of a trail I didn't recognize and I thought it must be past the gap. I continued down the trail. The next sign I was at the side trail name. When I looked at the other side it said Appalachian Trail <- 4.8 miles. I had taken the wrong trail. My second mistake was I had run out of water and failed to fill up at the last water point figuring I would get water in Gatlinburg. I hiked back 4.8 miles to the water point. I was EXTREMELY thirsty! It was horrible. I made it back to the last shelter but was confused because there was no other trail. I continued back and found a sign that said Appalachian Trail <- .3 miles. I continued back to the original sign for the shelter. I realized the shelter was NOT on the AT but a side trail. I had made the wrong turn when I turned towards the shelter at its sign. I turned back onto the AT and hiked the remaining 4.7 miles. All in all my easy 10.8 mile hike stretched to right at 21 miles for the day when it was said and done! So much for taking it easy on my ankle! It was almost 6 pm when I walked into New Found Gap. I called a few hotels and finally settled on the Grand Prix Hotel. The $29 hiker rate fixed it for me. I called the shuttle and was told they don't run on Sundays and Mondays so I called a cab the hotel recommended. The fair was $30 but you can split it if you have multiple hikers. They gave me a ride to the hotel and I settled in. The hotel was nicer than what I expected. I took a shower and changed clothes and went into Gatlinburg for dinner.,"Double Spring Gap Shelter

From there I again headed North on the AT. After a short time I rounded a curve and was shocked to see a doe standing 6 feet from the trail not 16 feet from me. We both startled! As she began to run I called out to her like I was speaking to a pet and said ""It's okay girl, it's okay"" and to my amazement she stopped! She slowly made her way back to the bush she was nibbling on when I startled her! I got my camera out and took several pictures of her. Finally when I went to leave she spooked slightly again and when I again spoke to her she settled and moved back to continue eating! It was one of the most incredible things I have ever seen!

I looked at the sign that asked if you killed a bear (a National Park add about using safe back country practices in bear country) and I saw a piece of moleskin taped to it that had ""Charley Murphy killed this bear"" written on it signed by Shiva! I figured he was behind me on the trail because he was saying he was going to spend several days with his friends off the trail but apparently it didn't work out and he is ahead of me by a day. I continued on. The trail followed beside a nice stream for a way and then it dumped out onto a road. The road crossed a bridge with white blazes on the curb. I crossed the bridge and made a right turn on the road following the white blazes. It was different walking on concrete for a change. I followed it down and turned left going under the underpass of I-40. About 100 yards past the highway the trail went back onto the dirt and climbed stairs up the hillside. I was a little confused by the lack of blazes on some of the turns during this leg. Thank God for the AT Guide during this section. The next mile of trail seemed pointless. It had several pointless up and downs (PUD's) and turned in a needless direction around a corner that could have been much shorter in my opinion. it emptied back out on the same road it left. I turned left on the raod and headed the 200 yards up the road to the Standing Bear Hostel. It had a old fashioned, rustic, air about it. The hostel is in the front building closest to the road. The owner was very nice. He is a veteran. When I walked in he was talking to one of the patrons about many veterans hiking the trail when they return from combat for decompression. I paid the $20 for the hostel (there was a cabin available for $25). There was 1 Southbound thru-hiker, 2 section hikers doing work for stay and Janna at the hostel. The 2 section hikers doing work for stay had obviously been drinking heavily when we got there. Janna asked if I would play a game of horseshoes. Neither of us could remember the rules. We just winged it. The 2 section hikers challenged us to a game and we skunked them. There was no doubt their drinking contributed to that. The hikers drinking continued throughout the night. I was worried it would cause an incident but that never occurred. They ended up taking mattresses out of the bunkhouse and sleeping in the floor of the kitchen. Showers are available at the hostel. The privy is a standard AT moldering privy. resupply is not readily available but some small items are available. Some frozen microwave meals are for sale and available from the freezer in the kitchen area. There is a microwave, stove and potable water available in the kitchen area. There is a fire ring if you feel the need for a fire. The hostel is a bunk room environment and has a pot belly stove for heat in the winter. Overall it was a fun experience.","Tri-Corner Knob

I was surprised to find out one of the section hikers who was drinking heavily the night before was vomiting into the privy. I packed quickly and headed back down the road to the trail. I hadn't really paid attention the day before to where the trail went after it crossed the road. It actually travelled down the road and back into the woods about 75-100 yards further down. The trail climbed pretty steeply immediately. My ankle started giving me problems immediately. The Naproxin is definitely helping though. It started raining this afternoon right before I got to Max Patch. My umbrella has definitely been worth the weight. It only weighs a little over 7.5 ounces. People often make fun of my umbrella but they don't understand the advantages. It allows basic rain protection (and wind protection I might add) without restricting ventilation. People often get wet beneath their rain gear. They think their rain gear is failing them but what actually happens is the rain gear restricts ventilation (yes, even expensive waterproof/breathable rainwear). This is not to say WPB fabric isn't worth it. I look at the umbrella as 85% usable in bad weather. If the rain is really hard then rain gear is still required. The umbrella only covers the upper half of my body. My shorts and legs still become wet. My legs are usually the warmest part of my body, do to the activity of hiking, so this is rarely an issue. Unless it is cold I don't usually bother to put my wind pants on (unless I expect really cold weather I do not take WP/B pants because my wind pants work in most situations). I strap my umbrella to the outside of my pack so it is easier to get to and quicker to deploy when it rains. This also keeps me drier. Since the umbrella doesn't restrict ventilation I don't have to slow down. Since the water isn't hitting me in the face my morale is easier to maintain. I also use it for wind protection in all but really high winds and use it to help strengthen my rain fly on my tent when needed or my tarp if using one. I resisted carrying one for many years due to the weight and the stigmatism associated with them. Once I hiked with one I discovered the advantages of them and now I rarely hike without one. When I reached the top of Max Patch the rain stopped. It was still very foggy though. I sat on the top and wished my view was better. As I decided to leave I started hiking down and noticed the fog clearing some. I waited a few minutes and took several pictures. The view almost completely cleared when it started pouring down rain so I again deployed my umbrella and headed for the next shelter. It was an easy two miles downhill to the shelter. Once there I hung my pack on the wall. Most of my gear was fairly dry. I changed into some warmer clothes. I made Packit Gourmet's ""Texas Chili"" for dinner. It was delicious. I definitely will be ordering more of them. A group of 4 guys came into the shelter right before dark. One setup a hammock, one setup a tent and 2 stayed in the shelter. I realized this is my last night on the AT. I am not ready for this leg to be over...","Standing Bear Hostel

Cool Breeze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394268,"I woke up and set out early. Two of the guys in the shelter last night said they are injured and unable to continue. They have a plan to get back to their vehicles parked in the Max Patch parking lot and drive to Hot Springs, N.C. to meet the other two in their party. The other two packed up and are planning to make it into Hot Springs later tonight. The morning is a little foggy but at least the rain has stopped. The trail started was fairy level starting out today. My blisters are better and I tried to start out with no blister care this morning. That was a mistake. I stopped quickly and bandaged my foot. Not too long after I bandaged my blistered foot my ankle started giving me problems. I reached the first shelter at around noon right as it started to rain again. There was a character in the shelter (he occupied the whole shelter with his gear) that said his trail name was ""Crazy Joe"". I could see how he got his trail name. There was also a group of hikers camped behind the shelter that were finishing packing up. Crazy Joe told me the trail consisted of PUD's (pointless ups and downs) before it reached Hot Springs. The trail was flat for a ways. Right before I got to the first good uphill my ankle started really hurting. At the same time the group of hikers from the last shelter caught up to me and I moved over to the side to let them pass and rest my ankle. This was the first time I had ever been passed while moving. About half way up the group was stopped. They appeared to be arguing over the tactics they were using. I passed them and one of them said ""I will see you again shortly"". I wasn't sure what he meant by that and I never saw him again to ask. This was a weekend and I was surprised how many people were on the trail today. Several groups complained about how wet they were and looked like they were trying to get off the trail. The last part of the trail was all downhill. I arrived in Hot Springs sooner than I thought. I stopped at the first hostel that is right at the spot the trail arrives at Hot Springs. I opened the door and asked if anyone was there. I got no response. I decided to check out the other hostel in town. The trail was a little confusing as it entered the town. It actually goes right down the sidewalk down the main strip. I stopped and ate lunch at the diner in town. It was very good and the cost was reasonable. I then crossed the street to Elmer's Hostel. I had been told on the trail to go around to the back and take off my shoes and enter through the back door. I walked around back and there was a note on the door from Elmer saying he was at a function out of town and would be back around 9pm. It said for hikers to take either room 5 or 6 and make ourselves at home. There were several hikers in the house. 2 I hadn't met before and Shiva! He had made it in the day before but was taking a zero! Janna also stayed at the hostel. Janna had family friends pick her up and take her to dinner and the rest of us walked to the local outfitter. Shiva negotiated and bought a hat and t-shirt for fairly cheap. Afterwards we crossed the street to the local pub for dinner. The atmosphere was nice and we listened to some local live music while we ate. Afterwards we returned to the hostel. The hostel was quite unique. It is an historical landmark. It was built in the late 1700's I believe. It has 14 rooms. It mainly caters to hikers. Non-hikers can stay there but I have heard accounts of them being refused service or asked to leave. Elmer is quite a character himself. I met him the following morning as we ate breakfast the following. We all were required to sit around the table (if you chose to eat breakfast at the house. It was an additional charge of $6) and introduce ourselves, tell where we from and why we were on the trail. The breakfast (and all meals served at the house) are vegetarian. It was quite nice. They serve breakfast at the diner across the street that I have heard is good also. After breakfast I walked back down to the outfitter and used the Internet and then walked across the street and washed clothes. Once done I walked back to the hostel and finished packing up. My ride arrived and my trip was over. I am already looking forward to the next one!",,"Elmer's Hostel/Hot Springs, N.C.","Sep 29, Sat",18
