AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567908,"This summer we (my wife and I) were scheduled to go to Spain for the third straight summer to walk the Camino. Unfortunately she had rotator cuff surgery in April, so that ended her trip. We had planned to be gone from July 4th to August 18th, so I looked for a good alternative. (We do plan to head back to Spain in 2018)
Last summer (2016) I herniated a disk in my lower back a couple weeks before we left. I hoped the pain would work it's self out. After walking 300+ miles I could not take it anymore. I had seen a doc in Spain and was taking prescription meds, drinking and had a cortisone shot. Nothing helped. We returned a couple weeks early and two surgeons told me I needed surgery and that I should not wait since I risked permanent nerve damage. I had successful surgery and am now ready to go again. 
We will be in Vermont for a family wedding on July 1. My wife will fly home to Arizona on the 3rd and I will drive to Connecticut. Ironically I was in Kent, CT on July 4, 2014 and summited Katahdin on August 16, 2014. My plan is to basically walk the same pace this summer.
I do not intend to do any more preliminary posts. This journal is really for family to know how I am doing. Feel free to contact me with any questions, whether they be AT related or Camino related.",,View Entry,"Jun 08, Thu",0
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570777,"started the morning in VT. Drove almost 5 hours to Danbury, CT where I got a ride to Kent. I walked this section on July 5th in 2014.
I am not sure of my plans. Plan A is to walk to Katahdin. Plan B is to walk north till the first week in August, then attend my 40th high school reunion in VT. Plan C is to walk north for a while and see what happens.
I saw only one person on the trail today. A SOBO section hiker. At the shelter everyone is in their tents because of the mosquitoes,  so no socializing tonight. I didn't start till 4pm today, so not surprising it was quiet on the trail.","Kent

AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570849,"A beautiful day to be on the trail. The woods are still very damp from the rains, so the humidity is very high – so very sweaty hiking up the hills. The shelter was busy last night with a boy scout group. At least they quieted down by 8:30 and noise was not an issue. Our tent site was very close to the Housatonic river. The river is in a valley with fairly steep hills on both sides. Turns out there is a train track on the other bank. About 9PM last night a train came through. It sounded like it was going to go right through our site. It was funny how the noise stayed in the valley.
Today started with an easy walk along the river. Three years ago I was almost 1,500 miles into my hike and in great shape. I remember this stretch being easy and doing 20+ mile days with no problem. Today – not so easy. The back is fine – no post surgery pain. It is still just trying to get in shape. It is actually a big reason I am out here, to get in shape. With the heat of Phoenix and all the available food at home I do not have the discipline to lose weight. I feel I must have lost a couple pounds just today. I know, wishful thinking.
Day 2 and I already am on a salt kick and not so much on a sugar craving. I gave away a cookie and a couple Snickers bars today. Met my first thru hiker. He is on the exact same pace I was on in 2014. He started April 11. I started April 13th and I hiked this section of trail on July 6th in 2014. It was fun chatting with him. Everyone else I have met has been on the trail less than a week.
Connecticut has lots of small climbs, no big ones. The trail is well maintained and marked. There are lots of good tenting options. I am at Belters Campsite tonight. I was at this same place 3 years ago. I did pick a different location to set up my tent, just to change things up a bit. CT also has lots of good water options, especially with the recent rains. This campsite is in a pine forest. It seems much dryer than the deciduous trees we have been in lately. I have all my stuff hanging to dry and it is actually drying, unlike last night.","Stewart Hollow

AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570952,"Last night was very noisy. I was in my tent ready for bed when fireworks started from 2 sides. We were in the forest, so could not see anything, but could sure hear them.
While walking you have plenty of time to think. Since I do not have firm plans I think about different options. To get to Katahdin by August 16th would take a pretty good commitment. I basically will have to walk the same pace I did in 2014 from here. I am only 3 days in and have been impressed with what I did 3 years ago. I want to enjoy the journey and not feel pressured to walk big miles. I am 10.2 miles in today and enjoying a long lunch. I have only 4.4 to get to the shelter I plan to stay at. The eastern humidity has been tough. My body is used to heat, being from Phoenix, but this humidity just soaks my shirt. So the thought of the day is to walk to Hanover, NH then jump ahead to Rangeley, Maine. I hiked that section in 2012 and again in 2014 during my thru hike. That is 220 miles, so roughly 2 weeks. I am not going to put letters by my plans anymore as I would probably run out of letters.
My wife and I were talking about the law of attraction the other day. Right now I am just outside Salisbury, CT (it is 1:30 – stopped for lunch). I am carrying too much food so did not want to hike the half mile into town because I knew I would buy lunch. But I was craving a cold soda, or any cold drink. I had decided to give up on the cold drink and keeping walking past the town. I get to the road and someone had placed a cooler full of drinks on ice. That made my day.
I have met two thru hikers so far. The trail has been quiet. I have seen a few hikers go by while sitting here eating lunch. 
Shortly after lunch I caught Al, a gentleman from the Yukon Territories. I told him he should go with Cornelius for a trail name – Yukon Cornelius from Rudolf. Anyway we had great conversation hiking along. I reached my destination about 4PM – 14.6 miles. I sat there for about 15 minutes and decided to keep walking 1.7 miles to a camp site. Al had taken off when I stopped, but he had stopped shortly after the shelter so we hiked together again. When I reached my second destination I still felt good so only 1.8 miles to the next camp site. Bottom line my 14.6 mile day turned into an 18.1. Al is tenting right next door so we will probably hike together again tomorrow. I am doing a short day tomorrow (12.9 miles) so he will continue on.
We made it to Massachusetts with the extended day. The first bit of Mass is beautiful as you follow a river gorge. Not my first thought when someone says Massachusetts.","Belters Campsite
",Laurel Ridge,"Jul 05, Wed",18.10
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571067,"Since I did a few extra miles yesterday it made for a shorter day today. I had called ahead to stay with Jess – a women who opened her house as a hostel a few years ago. She can take 7 hikers inside and allows tenting in her yard. Good thing I called, as she is totally full plus 2 people tenting. I had stopped at the side of the road (Route 7) at 2PM when a car pulled up and asked if I needed a ride. I said no – I am about to call for a ride. Turns out it was Jess, so no phone call needed. 
After a shower and getting the laundry set, I walked into town – less than ½ mile for lunch. The BBQ/Pizza place was closed so had to go to the MarketPlace. It was good, but not a hiker place – no fried food, salt or beer. Another hiker I had met previously walked in and joined me. We then walked across the street and bought beer and sat at a picnic table and watch the world go by. Chick Fil A then also joined us. I had met him yesterday while eating my lunch in the cemetery. Both of these guys are planning to through hike, but both started in Harpers Ferry. Today they passed 500 miles for them. Once they get to Katahdin they will go back to Harpers Ferry and hike south to Springer. It is called a flip flop hike. It seems quite popular this year as I have met several flippers. 
Everyone staying here ordered pizza for dinner. We all sat around a table, so it was nice to socialize. This area is full of section hikers and mosquitoes, so there is not much chance to meet people in the evenings. The two times I have stayed where there was a picnic table there was a boy scout group at one and a family with two teenage girls at the others. Thru hikers go to their camp site, eat and go in their tent to get away from the mosquitoes.
Massachusetts continues to be very pretty. Today we had a nice ridge walk. I really enjoy being out of the trees where there are views and a breeze. I did say good bye to Al. He has a mail drop in Dalton that is at the post office. To get there before they close at 1 on Saturday he has to do a couple 25 mile days. I did walk the first 5 miles with him, but I then stopped to filter water and he kept going. He and his wife are both lawyers in the Yukon Territories. He has travelled all over the world including 3 Caminos. 
The trail had a few rocky descents today. A small taste of what lays ahead for the thru hikers.","Laurel Ridge
","Sheffield, MA","Jul 06, Thu",12.90
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571168,"Today was a short day. I had booked a hotel room for tonight to take care of some business and it was good to slow me down so I do not over do it early in my hike. That said I plan to do 19.5 tomorrow to Upper Goose Pond and would love to do the 20 to another town (Dalton) the day after that.
I slept well last night. Turns out I got a private room at Jesses hostel. She had a nice breakfast with her neighbor’s eggs, fruit, etc. She dropped three of us off at the trail about 8 – O2, Minnie Mouse and I. We walked together the entire 8.6 miles together to my road crossing. It rained almost the entire time so the rocks were quite slippery. With the rains today I did not take a single picture. I am starting to feel better on the trail – just conditioning. The back has been totally fine – no issues from my surgery. 
This afternoon the skies cleared and I was able to dry everything out. Even my sleeping bag and tent were damp, just from the high humidity in the woods. I went out for a nice steak and potatoes dinner. Well, actually it was a McDonald’s burger and fries. Still tasted good and when you are walking, the closer the better. Great Barrington is not an inexpensive town. I am in a “cheap” hotel – the Travel Lodge and it is $150 a night. The Super 8 was $180 and the Comfort Inn $250.
I hitch hiked into town with no problem. Going out in the morning I have arranged a ride with a 6:30AM pick up. It is about 5 miles from here to the trail head. There is another hiker staying here at this motel who is going back with me. There are several other hikers staying here tonight as well. It rained today and is forecast to rain again tomorrow, so that increases the trail business for towns like this.
The rains tomorrow will probably be good for me. I sweat so much that I am drenched anyway, so the rains are cooler. It also keeps you moving because you tend to not sit down as much in the rain. The long range forecast is good, so that is nice.
I have met quite a few hikers the past few days. Makes the journey much more fun. O2 I have seen 3 days in a row. He recently retired and is doing a flip flop hike. Al is probably long gone as he wanted to be in Dalton (40 miles ahead of me) by noon tomorrow. O2 and Minnie Mouse are both planning to be at Goose Pond tomorrow, so hopefully I will see then there. Two other guys from the hostel last night are also planning to be there as well.
I know when I was hiking it was great to receive trail magic. I may hike to Hanover and rent a car and do some day hikes of my favorite spots and do trail magic along the way heading north. We shall see – one day at a time.","Sheffield, MA
",Great Barrington - Mass Route 23,"Jul 07, Fri",8.60
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571442,"Last night was productive in Great Barrington. I got all my obligations taken care of. Jess was outside at 6:20 this morning to take SongBird and I up to the trail. It has rained most of the night but the morning looked to be off to a good start. The trouble is we climbed into the hills so we were in the clouds for the first two hours. I was soaked very quickly with sweat. It was better yesterday with the rain since it kept me cool. SongBird and I stayed together for about 5 miles before he took a break and I moved on. We were both headed to Goose Pond Shelter so we knew we would see each other again. The middle of the day was great for hiking. The sun came out and it stayed fairly cool. I hiked a bit with several different people – Chick Fil A, Potter and Stretch. All seem to be nice young men. Massachusetts continues to be very pretty. A farm we walked by installed a little kiosk by the trail. They had all kinds of hiker items that you paid for on an honor system. I stopped for a cold soda before moving on. 
Shortly after it started to rain again. It was a brief shower and cleared up nicely. The miles were going well. I finished the 19 miles before 4PM. The Upper Goose Pond shelter has bunks for 14 people and is right on a great pond. (Yes Upper Goose.) I grabbed my dry clothes and headed down to the pond to swim and clean up. Just as I get there the skies opened up and it poured. Now I have nothing that is dry to wear. Bummer.","Great Barrington - Mass Route 23
",Upper Goose Pond,"Jul 08, Sat",19.10
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571450,"Counting the side trail to the Upper Goose Pond cabin I have done 41 miles the past 2 days. That was a piece of cake when I was thru hiking through here. Not so much this time, especially since it is my first week out still. Tomorrow is 16.2 to the summit of Greylock. I sure would love to do that, then back off the miles after that for a bit.
Not a ton of vertical today, but not great footing either. It rained hard again last evening, so everything stays wet in the woods. The trail continues to be well marked and maintained. Tomorrow we have a 2,000 foot climb up to the top of Greylock. It is the real start of the return to the bigger mountains for the through hikers. It has been since Virginia for them to have a big climb. The other states have plenty of vertical, it is just made up of lots of 500 foot climbs.
In the middle of today I stopped at the Cookie Lady’s house. She is just off the trail and has been supporting hikers for almost 30 years. She gave me 3 home made chocolate chip cookies. I also bought a soda and an ice cream. Three miles after that a gentleman was parked with his van with tons of cold drinks and food. He used to run a hostel and now he is retired and enjoys providing trail magic.
Only met a couple people today. Only one new northbounder. I was one of the first to leave Goose Pond and only a couple people came as far as Dalton.
Another short entry as I am tired from a long day.","Upper Goose Pond
",Dalton,"Jul 09, Sun",20.60
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571572,"Today was 16.4 miles to the top of Greylock, the highpoint of Massachusetts. The morning was up over a typical mountain of late, about 800 vertical, into the town of Cheshire. Not much going on this morning, so onward and upward. The total vertical to the top of Greylock was 2,500 feet. The biggest climb since mid Virginia for thee thru hikers. I hiked today with Minnie Mouse. We did not see a single NOBO thru hiker today. It was surprisingly quiet. We are staying at the Bascom Lodge at the top of GreyLock. There are two other women here who are section hiking, otherwise it is tourists. There were several other hikers in Dalton last night, but I have a feeling they all stopped at the shelter back 3 miles. Hopefully tomorrow will bring more familiar faces.
The climb was quite gradual. We knew the snack area closed at 4:30, so that was our goal all day, to arrive by 4PM so we could get a burger. Mission accomplished. I am getting low on food so tomorrow there is a road crossing about 5 miles in that I will go the .5 miles to a nice grocery store and stock up. I almost did that last night but it was .5 one way after a 21 mile day, so decided to rest instead.
It is interesting how it is much more difficult to plan as a section hiker. The distances didn’t seem to matter thru hiking. If I needed to do 23 miles it just meant I would get a good start and keep walking. Now 16 seems to be a big day. I looked at my notes from 2014 and then I arrived at the summit at 2:30 with the same start location and time as today. Today was a 4:00 arrival, so not too bad, 90 minutes longer. The back continues to be fine, no side effects.
Tomorrow we will be entering Vermont. I am still on the plan to finish Vermont and then rent a car and drive along the trail doing trail magic. Elizabeth would love to do that as well, so she will probably fly east and join me. Ironically today is the day were we scheduled to watch the running of the bulls in Pamplona. We are planning to return to Spain next summer, but we will go a little later so I can pick the blackberries along the way. 
I do have wifi tonight but probably not again till the weekend. Not sure where I will be able to post the next few days.","Dalton

AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571759,"No reception tonight so this will be posted tomorrow. Today turned out to be a good weather day. The forecast had called for afternoon rain. We were in the clouds when we left Greylock a little after 9. As we descended the clouds lifted. It stayed cloudy most of the day, but no rain. Mid afternoon the clouds got quite dark, but stayed dry for me. Dry meaning no rain. I was drenched in sweat all day. 
The trail continues to be quiet. At 7pm there were just two of us at the shelter (both of us tenting). While typing this a group arrived. I think they are all thru hikers that I have not met. I am in my tent away from the mosquitoes. Mid afternoon we arrived into Vermont. I was born and raised here, so fun to be hiking through here again.
Short post – all is good.","Mt Greylock

AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571764,"I have regular cell reception for the first time in 3 nights. We did have wifi on Greylock. We did not get any rain last night but the dew had everything soaked this morning. I had rinsed my clothes off in a stream last night and they were just as wet this morning. I remember the humidity being high during my thru hike, but it seems to bother me more this go round. The original plan for today was to go about 13 to a shelter, but 11 miles in there is a road to Bennington. I am able to catch up on a few work things, laundry is done and the pizza is ordered. Life is good. By doing these two short days I am hoping a few of my trail friends will be in my neighborhood tomorrow when we all keeping going north.

 

Many of this year’s class have been asking me about NH and Maine. I love sharing my stories and advice. There are quite a few flippers this year. I saw 3 SOBO thrus today. This is the beginning of when there will be lots crossing paths. I met a woman today who’s son did a SOBO thru hike in 2014. I did not remember meeting him. 
 

The trail was Vermont muddy today. There has not been much rain the past few days, so not super bad. I just read my journal entry from 2014 and I commented then, that the trail north of here was not nearly as muddy. I am looking forward to that. Of course the forecast is for rain the next two days. The plan is a 19 and a 21 to get to Manchester for Friday night. Being a tourist town there are no rooms available so I have a room booked at Bromely. Makes the food harder to figure out so I stocked up today.

 

Tomorrow I should pass the half way mark of this 280 mile section. I will also pass the 600 mile mark of AT section hikes. At this point I do not see ever finishing a section hike. While thru hiking I was in the mode of going north and very little bothered me. This section hiking is much tougher, getting new trail legs each time and staying motivated. With the rains forecast for tomorrow I am debating staying here. While thru hiking I never really faced that decision, I just kept going, the weather never really mattered. I met a couple women a few days ago who took 17 years to do a NOBO section hike. Now they are doing a SOBO section hike.

 

I am shooting to get to Hanover on Friday or Saturday July 22nd. Elizabeth is looking into flights into Manchester, NH. Once I get past Manchester Center, VT she will book them. My Class of 2014 buddy Slim will hopefully meet us in NH to do a trail magic day hike. That would be a lot of fun.

 

It is 4PM now and pouring outside. The rains were forecast to start in the morning. Hopefully they are early and will be done by morning. You can always hope.","Seth Warner Shelter
",Bennington,"Jul 12, Wed",11.10
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572035,"It rained quite a bit again last night. It was nice being in a dry motel. The plan for today was 19 miles to Story Spring Shelter. The forecast was rain in the morning, no rain during the middle part of the day with the rain returning early evening. We were dropped off at the trailhead a little before 7:30. We were in the clouds, but not raining. The trail continues to be very muddy. I think the local trail maintenance clubs have it that way on purpose.

 

We had several 1,000 foot climbs today, but nothing super steep. The miles went by fairly quickly. The trail continues to be quiet. We did see a few SOBOs. One woman lived in Phoenix for 10 years. She loved it there. It was fun chatting with her. Sir Linear was the only NOBO all day. We are tenting in the same spot as I write this.

 

With the forecast of rain I was hopeful to get a spot in the Story Spring Shelter. Since the trail was so quiet we figured it wouldn’t be a problem. When we arrived about 5PM there was a group there and they wanted nothing to do with us. I almost said something but decided to move on instead. It will make tomorrow a shorter day.

 

It was an additional 2.7 miles at the end of the day and meant tenting with rain in the forecast. The crew at the shelter had all their stuff spread out. They said they had 7, then another guy said 8. They were sure it would be too crowded for anyone else to jump in. The shelter is designed for 10, so that is 12 or 13 in thru hiker thoughts with a rainy night. Oh well. There were no real good tent spots there so Minnie Mouse and I moved on.","Bennington
",Black Brook,"Jul 13, Thu",21.70
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572036,"It rained most of the night. I stayed relatively dry, though everything is very damp. My tent is soaked. All three of us – me, Minnie Mouse and Sir Linear left at 6:15. At least I have a hotel room tonight to dry everything out. Common theme lately. The Vermont trail continues to be full of mud. No more comments about VT trails. See Thumper quote a few days ago.

 

Today started with a pretty good climb up Stratton Mountain. We were in clouds all day so no views. It did not rain, but was very wet all day. The temps were cool – 50s. I saw my second PF Changs marathon shirt today. Today was a guy who lives in Phoenix who is hiking southbound. The other day was a woman who had raced in the marathon but who lived in the east somewhere.

 

I have been having trouble with my water filter and I left my bear bag hanging rope at the campsite the other night. Manchester was full tonight so I am staying at Bromley on the other side of the hill from Manchester. I called the local gear shop and they had what I needed and an employee lives on this side of the hill so she will drop it off to me on her way home. Great service, Thanks Mountain Goat shop.

 

I am thinking I will get to Hanover next Thursday or Friday. The forecast calls for a 50% chance or better of rain on 6 of the 8 days. Elizabeth is planning to fly to Manchester on next Saturday the 22nd. We will then drive along the trail doing trail magic.","Black Brook

There were a few sprinkles during the day, but mostly dry. Late afternoon the sun even came out. Been days since we have seen the sun.

Sir Linear, Minnie Mouse and I started walking just after 6am. My goal for the day was 21.6 miles to Governor Clement shelter. Minnie Mouse was in, Sir Linear dropped off but soon after we caught Sassafras  he he hiked with us all day. He is another AT thru hiker. He is a few years older than me. Mid day we walked a bit with Bear Bait. She is tenting with us now. She is a Long Trail hiker. Tomorrow she will continue north on the LT and us AT hikers will turn east to Hanover, NH.
The terrain was a bit tougher today. Some steep ups and downs. It was actually sunny all afternoon and the sky is clear as I type this at 8pm. The forecast is for rain tomorrow afternoon.","Big Branch River

AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572309,"I typed the last couple entries on my phone in my tent, so they have been short. Tonight I am dry and warm at the Inn on the Long Trail. I got my first restaurant food of the trip. I have had McDonalds and take out pizza, but this was a good salad, burger and cold beer. 
 

Last night was dry all night. Been a while. The forecast for today was for afternoon storms. I got to the Inn about noon and sure enough by 2 it was pouring. T is now 4 and appears to be stopping. The next two days look to be dry, so hopefully. This trip has been planned around the towns and weather much more than when I thru hiked. Seems like I do a couple big days so I can have a short day into a town. 
 

Yesterday was a tough 21.6 miles, but sure set me up for today – 9.9 to a hotel with a rainy afternoon forecast. The forecast was accurate from3 days ago since we have not had reception the past 2 nights. I have had reception at different points on the trail, but I just check my work related stuff and move on. I have rehired two employees the past few days. It is nice to have the technology so I can be out here walking in the woods and still able to take care of things at home.

 

Last night was fairly busy at the shelter. Eddie Spaghetti rolled in after I typed my journal for yesterday. He started in Harpers Ferry and intends to flip after getting to Katahdin and hike south to Springer. I am amazed at how many flippers there are out here.

 

My Mother was on top of Mt Greylock in Massachusetts today and met Cauldron. I met him a few days ago. (He is hiking SOBO) She saw his Arizona T shirt and asked him where he was from. (He was the second hiker I saw wearing a PF Changs marathon T shirt.) He remembered meeting me a few days ago. These small world stories are fun. 
 

This morning we had a pretty good climb up Killington. The trail does not go over the summit. Last time I did hike the spur trail to the top, but today I was looking forward to a short day, especially with the forecast.

 

I am 47 miles from being done – so 3 days of hiking. I will have Friday off, then Saturday drive to Manchester to pick up Elizabeth. We still do not have any firm plans. I have quite a few acquaintances out here now, so should be fun if we can track some of them down.","Governor Clement

I saw a group of thru hikers getting water at Gifford Woods State park. They were off on a detour to the local outfitter but are camped nearby. This shelter is quite busy. Met a thru hiker couple as well. Seems like there lots of people around. When I did this section 3 years ago it was pretty quiet.
With the late start - 8:30 because of breakfast,  18.5 miles was an agreessive goal for me. I rolled in at 6pm tired and ready to be done. Today was sunny and dry, but also quite warm. It had rained hard for much of the night so the humidity was high in the forest.","Inn at Long Trail

AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572564,"Last night turned out to be busy at the shelter. Typical in that the section hikers tend to stay in the shelter and the Thrus tend to tent. It was a nice night, so I tented. All told there were probably about 15 of us at the shelter. Minnie Mouse was there and said how she had a friend picking her up in West Hartford and they were headed to Quechee. She offered for me to tag along. I am in the same hotel as them now. I am a day ahead of schedule, so will zero tomorrow and do the last 10 miles to Hanover on Friday. I twisted my ankle early on this journey and have been fighting it ever since. It will be good to stay off it for a day, then have an easy day to Hanover on Friday. I pick Elizabeth up at 4:18 on Saturday afternoon in Manchester, just over an hour from Hanover. I will probably pick up supplies on Friday afternoon and do trail magic on Saturday morning before heading to Manchester.

 

Today’s hike had pretty good treadway all day. Lots of little climbs and descents, but nothing too steep. Lots (10 or so) of SOBOs today. A few NOBOs. A couple guys passed me during the day. They were at the bridge in West Hartford getting ready to swim in the White River. Brrr.

 

I have been meeting quite a few hikers so it will be fun to do trail magic with Elizabeth. Yukon Al is ahead of me now, most of the others are a bit behind. It will be hit or miss if we can be in the right place at the right time. Should be fun either way. Taking a zero tomorrow will give me a chance to figure out and plan a basic itinerary us. She bought a one way plane ticket, so we have no return date at this time.

 

Since this journal is really to keep my family informed of where I am, I will probably do an entry for Friday and that may be it.","Winturri Shelter

Friday I had just under 10 miles to get to Hanover and complete this section of the AT. In 2012 I hiked from Hanover to Rangeley, Maine. The walk was pretty uneventful. I had a nice lunch and headed over to Enterprise Rent a car. They offer a great discount for hikers which worked out well. I then headed out and bought a cooler, pan, etc. and a bunch of food to do some trail magic in the morning.

 

Saturday morning headed to the trail ready to greet and feed some hikers. After about an hour the first two people showed up. Shortly after that a couple hiking SOBO showed. It was fun sharing stories. I cooked eggs for everyone. I had bought a package of cookies and they were basically gone. Over the next couple hours 4 more hikers showed up. I honestly was surprised there were not more. After noon I packed up and headed to Manchester (about 90 minute drive) to pick up Elizabeth. I had time, so off to do more shopping. Elizabeth was right on time (4:18PM) so after getting her luggage we went out to dinner in Manchester. We decided to stay the night in town there. We did go out to get a couple chairs to sit on.

 

This morning (Sunday) we drove almost 2 hours north to the middle of the woods. I had downloaded coordinates from my AT guide into the gps for a road crossing, but when we arrived at the listed coordinates they were not correct. Fortunately we saw the name of a dirt road and it matched the AT listing, so we just followed the road north 2 miles till the trail crossed. Within minutes of parking we had 8 hikers there. It stayed busy for the next 4 hours. There was never a time we were alone. Elizabeth loved it. I cooked 2 dozen eggs before running out. The chairs we bought and the home made 7 layer bars Elizabeth and her friend Sherry made before coming east were a big hit, unfortunately a couple NOBOs were telling some SOBOs about the eggs, but we ran out before they arrived. We still had drinks store bought cookies, bagels with butter and fruit, so still a good stop for them. At the first real break we packed up to go for a walk ourselves. We had minimal supplies left at this point. We walked south on the AT and ran into 6 hikers heading north. Overall an awesome day. All the hikers are so appreciative. I had met 5 or 6 of the hikers during my section hike so it was fun seeing a few familiar faces.","VT 14, West Hartford

AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573281,"Here is another multi day recap. I am done hiking – now full time doing trail magic with Elizabeth. Sunday while feeding the 30+ hikers that came thru, we met Monkey Man. His package had not arrived by Saturday when he walked thru Hanover, so he was planning to hitch the 25 miles back on Monday morning. The forecast was for rain all day, so we offered to pick him at a road crossing and drive back to Hanover and wait while he completed his chores. Sunday night we stayed in Lyme, NH and ran into Hunter again. I met him at the Inn at Long Trail last week. We had dinner with him and another local gentleman.

 

Monday morning it was raining as predicted and we headed off to find Monkey Man. He was at the road crossing right on time. After dropping him off in Hanover we drove over to Norwich, VT so Elizabeth could visit her mother’s grave. It was then off to resupply. We also bought a big tarp so we could be outside and not get soaked. It worked very well. We dropped Monkey Man back where we had picked him up and headed up the trail 5 miles to another road crossing. We set up our tarp by a beautiful stream. It was pouring out and quite cold – 55 degrees. We did have 5 hikers stop by, but all moved on after a quick break because they cooled down quickly once they stopped. We did not stay long ourselves. We then headed off to Lincoln, NH and the Holiday Inn Express. Just after receiving our room keys the fire alarms went off. Instead of waiting we decided to just head out for dinner. All was well when we returned.

 

Tuesday morning we figured we would get a leisurely start and get to the Kinsmans Notch trailhead about 11, go for a short walk and expect hikers about noon. We figured most would be hiking over Moosilauke so noon would be the first arrivers. While eating breakfast we noticed 3 obvious hikers hanging out in the lobby of the hotel. Of course we go and talk with them and they need a ride to Franconia Notch. We can do that. Elizabeth thinks no way can we fit 3 big guys with packs in our rental. When thru hikers need a ride it is amazing how many can fit in a small space. The normal drop off spot requires a 1 mile walk just to get to the AT. Fortunately I knew this spot so we literally pulled over on I93 at an overpass that the AT goes under to save our hikers the extra mile of walking. We ended up driving 5 miles north to turn around to head back south. They were very appreciative. We then headed over to the Kinsman trailhead. As we are setting up we realize we forgot food in our room’s fridge. Oh well, back to the hotel I go. Our first hiker arrived at 11:55. He is a triple triple crowner. He has hiked the AT, PCT and CDT 3 times each. This is his 4th time up the AT. This year he started in Key West Florida at midnight New Years Eve. He walked the Florida Trail to the Benton KcKay Trail to the AT. Quite a journey. He has almost 40,000 miles hiked on various trails. Soon after he arrived it was a steady stream of hikers. We had a great time. It soon became obvious we did not have enough food, so Elizabeth drove the 8 miles back to town to load up again. We had several repeat hikers from our previous stops. Again we had 30+ come through over a 4 hour period. At one point we thought we were done and cleaned up. Monkey Man was the only one there so we were just chatting. Just as we were about to load the car a couple brothers I met on Saturday rolled up. Then another few stopped so we brought everything back out and cooked some more eggs.

 

Today – Wednesday we moved up north a bit into the heart of the Whites – Crawford Notch. I was not too sure how many thru hikers we would have. Turned out only 3, but it was great having more time to chat. They all stayed for quite a while enjoying the food. Last night we had gone to Dunkin Donuts at closing time, so they gave us a 2 for 1 special, so we bought 2 dozen and they gave us another 2 dozen. The hikers today enjoyed the cold milk, donuts and eggs. Elizabeth brought one of them up the road a few miles to pick up a package he had delivered there. We packed up at noon and then drove up the auto road to the top of Mt Washington. Today was a perfect weather day – clear, almost no wind and the temperature was 54 degrees on top. Elizabeth appreciated getting back down the road as it’s a very curvy, narrow 8 mile drive up with lots of drop offs and no guard rails. The top was packed with people. I already miss the simplicity of trail life.",,View Entry,"Jul 26, Wed",0

Yesterday we were at Crawford Notch in NH doing trail magic. We met  'British Detective', he's from the UK and is a detective! He's 73 and had never backpacked before starting the AT. Over 2,000 miles is an ambitious 1st long distance hike! He started out with a 50lb pack, was convinced by other thru hikers to drop some serious pack weight and has gradually gotten it down to 30lbs but has lost 40 lbs of body weight too! Keeping enough calories on, especially for older men, seems to be a reoccurring theme we have heard.

Today we drove to Grafton Notch trailhead in Maine.  We soon found out it is a very popular start and end place for groups of short distance hikers. At least three groups of 8-10 young adult chaperoned groups were in the parking lot while we were there (8am-11am). We catered only to the thru hiking crowd. We had over 25 hikers in the 3 hours. The big hits were scrambled eggs, chocolate milk, Cokes and Dunkin Donuts. They were so grateful for hiker supplies like Duct Tape and safety pins! Loads of thankful fist bumps and hugs good bye from yet again, these fabulous, interesting and ambitious hikers. Just as we ran out of food, 4 people that had just finished their thru hikes come up in a pickup truck and unload the beginning of another round of great Trail Magic for the remaining thru hikers today.

Re: the hiker box/supplies we had to give out...the rewards for us are how excited and appreciative simple items can be to thru hikers! One young man took some toilet paper we had offered him. He replied  ""thank you so much!"" and after looking more carefully said with a big smile ""And this is the good stuff!"". Another hiker took a single rubber band and made a point to tell me he was so grateful! Today's hikers benefited by receiving homemade, dried, individually packaged food. I drove a guy, yesterday, to get a box he forwarded to himself. But, since he packed it back home 5 months ago, he realized he over estimated what he wanted to carry over the Whites. He gave me a good amount of nice, organic, high protein food to pay it forward.

One last day tomorrow of being Trail Angels here in Rangeley, ME : ) Gary (AZ) will be hiking with Slim tomorrow, a buddy driving up from Boston. They met while both guys were thru hiking in 2014.",,View Entry,"Jul 27, Thu",0
AZ Cruiser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573589,"Slim (a 2014 AT thru hiking buddy) drove up from the Boston area on Thursday afternoon to meet Elizabeth and me for dinner. We all stayed at the Town and Lake Motel. There were five 2017 thru hikers staying at the motel so we had fun sitting on the patio, looking out at Rangeley Lake and comparing AT stories.

 

Friday morning Slim and I had a great hike up Saddleback. It is always fun reconnecting with fellow members of our 2014 class of thru hikers. The hike up was 5.7 miles and gained about 2,600’. We were in the clouds when we first arrived on the summit but it soon cleared and we could see all the way back to Mt Washington. The peaks north of us remained stuck in the clouds. The day brought back so many great memories of Maine and the completion of our journeys. 
Elizabeth spent the morning in the trailhead parking lot socializing with other hikers and handing out drinks, fruit and cookies. We met several NOBOs who had chatted with Elizabeth as we were on our way down. Part way down was a typical beautiful Maine lake. We took the short side trail to sit on the shore. Train Wreck was there hoping to find a moose. No luck today. Train Wreck has 215 miles left to spot a moose. In 2014 I did not see a single moose on the trail. I did see several travelling from towns in the morning heading back to the trail. Slim had seen 3 moose during his hike. It was a glorious day to be in the mountains.

Friday evening we had a great dinner while sitting on a patio overlooking the lake. Four of our new NOBO friends were also there. Slim agreed to bring them back to the trail at 6:30 the next morning.

Saturday morning we packed up once again. We headed to Height of Land overlooking Mooselookmeguntic Lake. A beautiful spot to hang out for a bit. Only 2 hikers came through while we were there. Mid morning we decided to head to Andover for a late breakfast. We ended up on a logging road, which made things interesting. We were headed the correct direction and did in fact end up in the right spot. After a wonderful meal at the Little Red Hen – I had been there in 2012 and 2014, we walked the town. As we are passing a house a gentleman called out to us. We were confused at first, but it turned out we had met him a couple days before at Grafton Notch. He had been dropping off 3 hikers while we were doing trail magic there. It was then back in the car and off to Freeport to visit my brother form a few days before flying back to Arizona. 
It has been a fabulous month being on and around the AT again.",,View Entry,"Jul 30, Sun",0
