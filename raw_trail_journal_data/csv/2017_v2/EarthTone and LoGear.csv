EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540497,"If I haven't already pulled the trigger of announcing a long distance hike, making it official, I am pretty much locked and loaded.  Lisa and I have discussed the possible plan of heading down to Georgia and getting back to Springer, to then hike North, towards the place where Pamola resides.  

In my current line of work, I get the question all time of ""have you hiked the whole trail?"" from a lot of our visitors.  I immediately point out that I have done a decent portion of the trail, but next year, my bride and I will set our sites north on an adventure in walking.  Each time I say it, it feels more real to me.  It builds my excitement, my need, to get on the trail, become an outsider and hike north into the mists.  

Being immersed in the Trail Culture and hiking whenever I can squeeze in the time, I have a decent idea of what to expect.  I also expect to experience a lot of things I haven't yet and might not have thought of.  That's what adventures are.  A voyage into the unknown.  

So, as the idea becomes more real, things resembling obstacles keep throwing themselves in front of us.  We deal with each challenge as it comes and think that this might jeopardize our plan, but we fight on, taking care of the problem and for now, continuing on.

First, there is the ""wedding"".  Daughter number one is tying the knot in October.  Once that financial ruining, er, glorious event happens, we can set our sights towards Georgia, and Springer and ""The Hike"".  

Another recent situation was my back going out more than it ever has before.  With a months long recovery that signals to me that my body isn't getting any younger.  I got to see what I have left in the tank.  I have to get out there before my back says ""unuh,  you done.""  

Some more recent perceived barriers (omens) are some equipment failure issues at the house.  Not long ago the washer gave up the ghost.  Last week, the dryer decided it was its turn.  Yesterday, the computer's power supply started giving off a very smokey smell and won't power up the unit anymore.  I seems as if Pamola is already challenging me.  Already scoffing at my audacity of assuming I would be allowed to start this Quest.  The Quest of Pamola.  

But attempt the Quest we will.





Brandi, (daughter number two), will be our home base support team leader.  Her team of one will tend to the house and its furry occupants.  Ensuring the lights stay on and the trains run on time.  She is predicting we will be home in a month at most.  She may be right, but who knows.

I'm not obsessed with the job title of Thru Hiker.  If we go all the way, great, but I really don't care if we make it all the way in that calendar year.  I have already realized that I will be hiking the trial until I can no longer walk.  If I do go and finish the trail in one season, I still won't be done.  I won't be finished hiking. 

So, if I find myself pulled back to the ""other"" world during the hike, that's ok.  I will do what I have to do and get back to the trail when I can.  I'm a hiker until the end.

You might be wondering what is this Quest of Pamola.  What is this ""Pamola""?  

Pamola is an indigenous god, (sometime labeled a demon), who can control the weather.  Actually a storm god.  He has the head of a moose, the feet and wings of an eagle and the body of a man.  He resides in Katahdin.  You must appease him if you think you can summit that greatest mountain.  The ones who feared/worshiped him, thought it taboo to enter his domain.  The mountain...





To appease Pamola you must sacrifice ""fat and oil"".  I plan on making that sacrifice using bacon and olive oil.  Seems like that will work.  Add a little to the fire.  Say a few words and you might found worthy. 
If we make it to Pamola's domain, and if we are found worthy, we will summit in glory and celebrate the event.  But it will only be an event.  Not the first, not the last, just one point in time, where we were found worthy.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541265,"They say there is never the perfect time to do a Thru Hike. That serendipitous confluence of happenstance and preparedness that tell you, Now Is The Time. You must make the decision to ""just do it"" to steal a phrase. If you don't ""cease the day"", you will possibly regret it. Or you just won't do it. Since I Need to do it. The time is at hand. 

It won't be easy. Adjustments will have to be made in every sector of our lives, but now... is... the... time... But that is the challenge that I seek. To get out of my comfort zone in areas that I haven't had to go out of for I don't remember how long. Financial... Mental... Physical... I'm ready to ask the question and see what the answer is. 

It's time to shit or get off the pot. They say that there is never the ""right"" time to attempt a Thru Hike. Each time I think of doing a Thru Hike, about a dozen reasons why now isn't the best time enter my head. So as many advisors say, ""you have to just do it"", it is time for us to just do it.


The Mission: To traverse the length of the trail, having adventure, challenge and fun along the way. To be a Long Distance Hiker (LDH)

So in what has become almost a prerequisite to starting a hike according to ""The Good Badger"", Zach Davis, of Appalachian Trials fame, here are my ""lists"":“I am thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail because…”(I amended to) Why I want to Hike the AT:1. To be an Outsider for a time.2. To join the ""club"" of 2000 milers.3. To experience extreme challenge.4. To rediscover my wild spirit. 5. To commune with the Mother and her environment.6. To live simply for a time.7. To immerse myself in the Hiking Culture.8. Sorry to copy JFD, but I too feel that I am meant to hike the whole trail. One way or another, I feel a need to do every mile. 9. To spend quality time with my bride.10. To have an adventure.What's not important to me: (a list I thought of all by myself)1. Being called a Thru Hiker and expecting special treatment.I don't let the term Thru Hiker hold any power over me. It is defined in so many different ways, that it has lost a lot of meaning. I choose to not use it to describe myself. Here are some terms I am thinking about: Just starting out I will be a THA (Thru Hiker Attemptee). This lasts until you enter Virginia. At Damascus, I will become a Long Distance Hiker. Not until I have started the down hill slope of the mileage chart will I even consider being called a Thru Hiker.2. Being a purist in any way.If I want to take the other trail out of a shelter area, so be it. If I want to Aqua Blaze, I will. Blue Blazing? Maybe. Yellow Blazing? Most likely not, but I have learned in hiking that you never say never. This is an adventure, I don't want to constrain it by trying to be a purist. That's too much like the ""other"" world.3. Worrying about making miles.4. Worrying about not ""finishing"".
5. Earning that special ""2000 Miler"" certificate by strictly following their rules.  I can always make a ""HYOH"" certificate on my handy dandy computer.  It's just a piece of paper.“When I successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trail I will…”...have a feeling of accomplishment....start looking for my next adventure....continue to be a part of the A.T. Culture in many different ways.“If I give up on the Appalachian Trail I will…”...be dead, because the trail will be with me for the rest of my life. I'll never ""give up on"" the trail as long as I draw breath.

I made a Blog Post back in 2014 that I called That List of Failure.  I know Zach meant that third list to be used as a motivational tool to help a hiker find the strength to keep going, but I couldn't stop feeling that it was just a lot of mental brow beating.  My list became a positive thing because, as you can see above, completing the Thru Hike isn't my be-all-end-all goal.  The adventure is the goal.  Here is my list from that post.  It still rings true two years later.

 ...most likely try again. ...know that the trail will always be there... waiting for me... to come back. ...realize that being ON the trail is the place to be.  Why rush the journey? ...believe that a goal not yet achieved, is still a challenge to be taken.  ...still have a bucket list item to strive for. ...still love the trail with yearning.  Wanting to be hiking on it, experiencing the world of the AT, always. ...not be afraid to adjust my goals and work my way towards them at a life enjoying pace. ...not think of myself as a failure. ...learn a lot about myself that I didn't know. ...know that I did so much more than those who never leave their front door.Remember: The journey is the destination.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543503,"Since
I started seriously hiking the trail, I have always enjoyed sharing my journeys
with the world.  I’m sure only my family
and a few friends actually read my shit, but I really write it for me.  I like to be able to go back and read what I
wrote and have it bring back memories and good feelings from my
adventures.  Sometimes, it also brings
back the pain and that is a good thing. 
It’s good to remember the pain.  





I have
used various methods of logging my hikes. 
Trail Journals (TJ) is one where I have recorded all of my hikes, both
on the A.T. and elsewhere.  The website
has good and bad attributes.  It is
really good at keeping track of your miles and your stops. Where you sleep and
pictures you take and a few other good things, but you must fill out the entry
form correctly and string them together properly.  The bad is that it is a little hard to
navigate using a phone with spotty signal out in the bush.  Many times I have abandoned posting from the
trail and just took good notes.  When I
returned home to my computer, I would update the journal.  I have seen long distance hikers use the app
throughout their hike.  Updating from the
mountain tops and staying fairly close to real time.  I will try this during our long hike, but
make no promises.







I also
have maintained a blog using the blogspot (blogger) website.  The site has an easier interface both at home
and on the go and has a better layout than the TJ site.  What I have learned is I can create something
here with pictures and links and then copy its html over to a TJ entry and it
will look the same.  Pictures and links
and all.



So
this blog has all of my hikes on it too with additional content about the weird
and special things I think about, then write about in this world.  This is sort of my Central Information
Center, my Home Base.







Facebook
has also come in handy where it is really easy to post a quick update with a
little bit of signal.  You can even post
pictures if the signal is strong enough. 
This is the old go-to if I’m feeling lazy, but still want to
update.  I have created this Like Page to
also track our journey.  We will see how
it works out.



There
is another site, not unlike TJ, called Postholer.com.  It could do a lot of things and had a great
app for your phone, but it was spartan looking and the app disappeared from
Google Play.  (I heard that the author of
the app died and when the license ran out, the app was removed).  I have an account on postholer, but I don’t
plan on using it any time soon.





There are multitude of other sites to use.  Snapchat, Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter and Wordpress to name a few.



Regardless
of which site(s) I choose to use, I will always have my handy dandy lo-tech
notebook where I record the particulars of the day and can refer back to when
it is time to write the journal entry, which will be written into my phone in
the Google Keep app.  From there I will
be able to cut and paste to whichever app or site I want.  



The
big question is, will I be able to maintain my journaling while we are
hiking?  I have seen it happen countless
times.  The hiker starts out updating
every day, then it falls off to a couple times a week.  Before too long, the hiker is updating about
once every week or two, before they throw in the towel and admit that after
hiking for 10 to 12 hours, getting water, eating dinner and any other chore
that needs to be done, writing a journal entry loses to sleep.



If
that happens, so be it.  I will have my
notes and eventually, I will be able to tell my story.



Peace

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544147,"Baltimore Jack was once asked what he did in the ""Real World"" and his answer was, ""I Hike"".  For him (and for me, too) the Trail (no matter which one it is) is my ""Real World""  I have started referring to that world of cities and concrete and highways as the ""Other World"".  I hike in the ""Real World"" and when I'm not hiking and I get pulled back to that world of cities and concrete and highways, I'm pulled back to the ""Other World"" (OW).



Now that we have that terminology covered, I'm here to talk about that shady huge octopus that has at least a dozen tentacles that are continuously waving back and forth, searching for a part of me to grab and pull me back to the Other World.  There are so many things that can do that and when you are on a long distance hike, those tentacles are everywhere.  



Just off of the top of my head I can think of things that will demand our return to the OW.  First there would be the family emergency.  Both Lisa's and my Fathers aren't getting any younger, so, (god forbid) something happens, we will be coming back.




Then there are the major household casualties/emergencies.  Something major breaks that Brandi (Home Base) can't handle and we will have to come back to take care of it.  In the last few months, we have replaced our hot water heater, washer and dryer, so we are hoping that the rest of our major appliances will last the six months we plan on being away, but you can never be completely prepared.  

I am diligently trying to teach Ms Home Base all the little things that she will need to be able to handle as the head of the household, but when I start to make a mental list, it grows to outlandish lengths.  I will need to start writing stuff down.  Bills that need the old fashioned check and snail mail payment, grass cutting, dog and cat care, grocery shopping, dish washing, laundry, trash day, etc.  I get a little anxious just thinking about it.  

I don't know if our life in the OW will ever settle down enough to enable us to spend time in the RW tentacle free.  As long as we have people and things that can possibly draw us back, the potential will be there.  We aren't selling the house or getting rid or our cars or anything major like that.  We will have to maintain our life there, even while we have left it for a time.  

I'm guilty of letting the OW suck me back in.  When I retired, Lisa and I headed down to Georgia to hike for three weeks from Amicalola to Fontana, but when Lisa twisted her ankle as we were coming down off of Springer, I immediately gave up the plan.  I decided that I didn't want my bride limping through Georgia in pain.  I decided to get us back to our truck and then go from there.  I know now that that was a major fail on my part.  First of all, I really didn't ask Lisa if that was what she wanted to do.  I fell into the ""protect my baby"" mode and just wanted to make it ok for her, giving up on the plan to hike around 175 miles.  What we should have done was rest for a couple days at a Hostel and then decide what to do.  There was no hurry.  I regret that I did that.  My baby is a lot tougher than I give her credit for.  A lot tougher.  So lesson learned and score 1 for the tentacle.  

My Ultimate Goal for this hike is to become an Outsider and have an Adventure.  Completing a Thru Hike is a secondary goal.  If it happens, fine, but I'm not going to obsess about it (too much).  The Journey is the Destination.  As I said before, getting to Katahdin will not be the end of my hiking.  Just another memorable mile post along the way.  I will hike until I can no longer walk.  

So have at it tentacles.  I will avoid you if I can, but I like to think I'm flexible enough to be able to be pulled back for a  time and then to return to the Real World, when I can and hiking on.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551638,"While my Subaru sits in the shop with a leaking transmission, our preparation plans continue.  That current repair may dig into our gear purchasing fund, but we only have a couple of things to buy to make our kit complete.  Truth be told, we could hit the trail today with what we have and be OK, but these last purchases can cut more weight while making us a bit more comfortable.  All we really need besides a few consumables are some quilts (both top and under) and maybe some new hammocks.  These items will cost somewhere over $1000 for the both of us.  




That's tranny fluid all under the truck

Something I had been thinking about was the best way to check our packs when we fly down to Atlanta.  I don't want to just throw the pack as is, with its hanging stuff onto the luggage rack at the counter.  I want to lessen the chance of losing things or having them messed with.  I found a nice duffle bag made specifically for that purpose at REI and purchased two of them.  They arrived yesterday and I threw all my gear into one to see if it fits.  Not only does it all fit (including trekking poles and crocks), but there is still room to spare.  Now, it looks pretty huge, so I don't want to fill it to the brim and risk being charged for oversized luggage, but these should work nicely.  One thing I really like about them is they collapse into their own zippered pocket that is pretty small.  We will mail them back home once we get to Georgia.  




From this, to this.

I also pre-ordered two copies of AWOL's A.T. Guide.  (one for us and one for home base).  They have a nice early bird deal going and having two copies will help with coordination with Brandi ""Home Base"".  I also plan on getting a pdf copy for my phone when they are available.  



I have started to make some inquiries down in Georgia as I plan our arrival and transportation to the trail.  We plan to fly into Atlanta and take the MARTA train up to the northern terminus where we will be shuttled to either a Hostel, Amicalola Falls or Springer.  The planning continues. We will also need to pick up some fuel and any last items that we are missing before starting the hike as you can't pack canisters filled with a highly flammable gas.  We have some tentative plans to get some help from a friend down in Georgia, but those plans are still in their infancy and are still very nebulous.  When they firm up, I will talk about them.

The preparations continues and will most likely do so until we head to the airport.  As of today we have 158 days until we hit the trail, but who's counting.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552260,"Oh man, do I love buying gear. Being able to lighten my pack by about 3 pounds was a fun, if expensive endeavor. I have had quilts on my ""to buy"" list for awhile now and was seriously thinking of moving from the Hennessy Hammock to the Warbonnet Blackbird Hammock for some time. After receiving a Blackbird as a parting gift from the A.T. Museum, I was on my way to our last major upgrade of gear. Well, $1200 or so later, we now both have Blackbirds (I'm really loving this hammock), new Edge tarps and have top quilts and under quilts being made for us by Enlightened Equipment Elves as we speak. I can't wait to get this gear out on a couple training hikes and see how comfortable I will be in this new setup. I'm confident that I will be cozy and comfy. A lighter load with no loss in performance is always a plus.Our starting gear is just about set. We are both doing minor tweaks to the other gear like clothing and the other little things that go into a pack and add to its weight. Keeping meticulous track of what each item weighs really lets you know where to work on it. LighterPack.com is helping with that a lot. I'm trying to get my base pack weight around 20 lbs. (LoGear is already there), but I have about 2 more lbs to go. I have found that my clothes weigh a bit more than hers.

Our purchase of four quilts (two top, two under) were in the area and ""out for delivery"". When I received the email a few days ago of the shipment of our order, it noted that the 31st was the expected ETA. Luckily, the postman was still busy this Holiday season and they came a day early. The box hadn't even cooled from where the delivery person had carried it and placed it on my stoop before I was picking it up and bringing it inside. This was an $876 investment that has saved us a lot of weight and will greatly add to our comfort. The top quilts are 20 degree and the under quilts 30. We should be nice and toasty on the trail and in our hammocks. This purchase is our last (major) one until we head out. It is also what I will be calling my luxury item as they will be the most expensive things in our packs. I have done a quick setup with them and slept with the top quilt once. I can't wait to get them out in the woods for a night or two. I have been building (and rebuilding) my pack contents for six years now.

I will write all about it after it comes to pass, but I'm so happy to start our adventure this way, with some special ""people of the trail"". My A.T.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553624,"Since we upgraded our sleep and shelter system, I have been chomping at the bit to get out in the woods and see how it feels.  We decided that last weekend would be good, as the temperatures were going to stay in the 40's for a couple of days.  Rain was in the forecast, but weather never interferes with our plans.  In fact, a couple rainy days were perfect to test our gear (and ourselves) to possible wet conditions.  We were also bringing Ginger our Golden Doodle (now trail named Mama Bear).  She loves to come out with us when we head out, so we thought it would be good to bring her for our short hikes. 




Mama Bear and LoGear heading down the misty trail


The original plan was to drive to old Rt 40 at the Old South Mountain Inn, hike into Rocky Run shelter, overnight, then hike back to the car, drive to the Rt 70 overpass parking and hike to Pogo Campground for a second night.  Plan B would be put into effect on Saturday after an unexpected challenge. 



LoGear works a night shift, so she usually doesn't arise until after Noon.  She had Fridays and Saturdays off.  We had everything ready to go and got on the road at around 1240 on Friday.  The drive was a little over an hour and after a quick stop for lunch at McDs, we were at the A.T. Parking lot next to the Inn and on the trail around 1400.  



The weather was damp.  Scattered showers had been coming through for a while and even though we didn't get rained on, everything was a little drippy.  We arrived at the shelter after the quick, easy 2.1 mile hike at 1455 and set up camp.



LoGear wanted to test her new sleeping pad along with her new quilts, so she set up in the empty shelter.  The plan was for Mama Bear to sleep with her.  We brought a couple of blankets for her.

  


LoGear's set up




I wanted to see how my new under quilt and top quilt worked in my new hammock, so I set up right outside the shelter where Mama Bear could see me.  She likes to know we are safe.  




EarthTone's hammock set up




It was still pretty early in the day, so we puttered around the shelter area, getting water and gathering wood.  The temps were in the low 40s, but felt comfortable with a puffy on.  



Darkness comes early in the winter so we ate dinner as darkness settled in the holler.  Even after a nice fire, we were contemplating heading to the quilts at around 1830 and we did just that.  



Here is my notes from Friday:

Moonsday, 30 Afteryule:Left home around 12:40ish. Parked at South Mountain Inn. Hiked about 2 miles to Rocky Run Shelter. Arrived at 14:55. Set up hammock, gathered wood, fed Ginger. Make a fire and dinner as it got dark early. Went to hammock around 1830. Lisa is in shelter with Ginger. It's about 40 degrees with rain off and on all day. Nothing while we were hiking and only a few minutes when we were up on the hill top checking out the camping area. There is a breeze, but the woods are calm and quiet. Ahh, winter in the woods. I can feel some cold on my back, but it isn't too bad. The setup probably needs adjusting. This is why we are out here. To test the new gear and learn how to use it.

 I went to my hammock and read for a while and then tried to get some sleep.  My sleeping was sporadic and not very fitful.  I don't think I had my under quilt set up exactly right and from time to time I would feel cold under me.  I also need to get used to the top quilt.  It isn't like a sleeping bag where you can zip yourself in and virtually eliminate most drafts, but acts more like a blanket.  It sure does feel warm though, but I will need to adjust to how it works.  I hung out in the hammock until I was ready to star the next day which was around 0530.  11 hours in the hammock.  Nice.

Mama Bear seemed to have a restless night.  She wasn't content to just sleep next to LoGear, but had to patrol the area and check on me every so often.  She seemed just as content sleeping in the shelter, under my tarp or in the middle of the blue blaze trail coming into camp.  In the morning we christened her Mamma Bear as she seemed to be protecting and watching over her ""babies"" all night.  

I got up in the darkness and just took it easy.  I knew it would be a while until LoGear rolled out as I could tell she was up a lot during the night checking on Mama Bear who was checking on me.  She also needs a couple of days to adjust to a schedule that has you getting up with the sun.  But the sun wasn't going to be seen all day.

I started the day with a couple cups of coffee with some Carnation Instant Breakfast stirred in.  Next we went down to the spring to fill up the bottles.  There was a super dense fog.  We were in the midst of the cloud so to speak.

Next I gathered some wood for a morning fire.  Everything was damp to wet, but my nice fire starters never let me down.  I ate breakfast and started breaking down my camp.  I know my tarp was going to be packed up wet because nothing was drying in this damp, drippy weather.  


Mama Bear enjoying the foggy morning


The woods woke up, but the quite remained.  It was super peaceful and I glorified in being outside and enjoying the day as it was given. Eventually LoGear had enough of laying in the shelter and came out for breakfast.

Here is my Saturday morning notes:



Treesday, 01 Solmath:Slept kind of cold. Up around 0530. Made coffee, got water, collected damp wood, ate bfast, etc. 38 degrees with fog and dripping trees. The metal shelter room is like a drum beat for every drop. I need to figure out my under quilt. I'm not sure I have it set up right. We headed out of camp at 1048.
Just before we left, we met two hikers coming in.  We chatted a bit.  They had just come in from where we had parked for the night.  They went up on the ridge to set up as we headed back down the blue blaze to the trail.

We hiked back out in the foggy morning, passing about seven others coming in, stopping at the Dahlgren campground for a bit to use the porta potty.  This site is really nice in the warmer seasons, as it has showers and running water.  

We were quickly back at our truck.  Yesterday we had been the only vehicle in the lot, but there were already four or five vehicles parked there now.  I was a little surprised that so many other were coming out on this dreary day, but I guess there are a lot of others who are like me and don't let weather be a factor in whether or not you go out.  This would be an omen of things to come.

We headed to the next parking lot.  A pretty large lot on Rt 40 just before it passes of Rt 70.  I followed the GPS instead of going a somewhat longer, but straighter route which turned out to be a twisty, windy series of back roads that I feared would upset Mama Bear's stomach.  

She used to get car sick when she was young, but had pretty much outgrown it for the most part, but we were asking for trouble by risking it.

When we arrived at the parking lot, it was completely full.  Even the overflow area had a car in every slot.  This sucked pretty much.  We decided that we had learned a good deal from our one night out and would schedule more as we can.  It was time to end this adventure and head home.  

Mama Bear was acting thirsty and LoGear gave her a little bit of water.  Just as we pulled away to head to McDs again, she covered my middle console with some nice dog puke.  

After a clean up we were on our way.  This was not the first time she has done this, but last time I was able to catch most of it in her bowl.  Oh well, next time we will get out of the vehicle and let her drink, then let her stomach settle.  

We had packed basically our whole kit for this test that we will be bringing on our Hike along with some extra stuff for the dog and our packs weighed in at 28 and 29 pounds.  My pack felt good on my back and LoGear said she felt good too.  

Some Lessons Learned:
1.  Learn the proper way to set up that underquilt
2.  Adjust to using a quilt instead of a bag
3.  I will be bringing my crocks.  The DIY ""sandals"" I had made were OK for slipping them on for a quick walk to piss, but I just like having the crocks, so I will take on the extra 12 oz or so.  
4.  Mama Bear doesn't sleep well when we are separated in the night. 
5.  Don't give Mama Bear water inside the vehicle any more.

I look forward to our next gear test.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555111,"60 Days until we head out.LoGear and I went to REI to try to complete our gear list with a purchase of two pairs of Altra trail runners. After trying on a few different styles and sizes, we both picked the Lone Peak 3.0s. ($120) They are a zero drop shoe (toe and heal are at the same level in the shoe) and we have seen a lot of hikers using them. LoGear always has a lot of trouble getting the right shoe, so hopefully this will work for her. We went out yesterday for our weekly pack-on hike in nearby Patapsco State Park, which is pretty much the only park around here that has substantial elevation change. The loop is about 4.6 miles with some decent ups and downs. We worked our way around in the summer, uh, spring, uh, late winter 70 plus degrees, taking breaks a few times, mostly for Mama Bear (Ginger) who still has a bum knee and had recently had some minor surgery to remove some fatty cysts. It was a good hike.We were both somewhat sore after the hike. I'm thinking that our bodies need to get used to the shoe. I'm personally considering returning my pair as my past issues with plantar fasciitis might be compounded with this type of shoe. We both had a weird soreness in our backs. This is different from my usual back pain, (which is chronic for me, but not too bad) and we were hobbling around a bit. My feet are still a little sore this morning, but they pretty much always are after a decent hike. I'm not sure if I'm imagining more pain and relating it to the shoe, or if it is actually making things worse.Regardless, I will give the shoes at least 50 miles before I decide to return them and revert back to my cheap New Balance shoes, which have always served me well.   We sit and read others heading out on their Adventure and can't wait until it is our turn. It is nice to see how those already out there who post videos or journals are doing. We are taking notes in our Guide as they point out certain things like shelter conditions, etc. After watching another installment from the ToeSalad family hike, I purchased a few items for foot care. Some Deep Blue, a really nice smelling, but somewhat expensive doTERRA product that will rejuvenate our feet after a long day and some more friction reducing cream. I'm being extra careful with foot care on this hike. I used to never get blisters, but that has changed as I have hiked more and I'm hoping to minimize that as much as possible at the beginning of this hike. LoGear always has issues with blisters. So, my first aid kit is mostly foot care products. We continue to count down the days, fiddle with our gear here and there and keep preparing for our Quest. It can't come fast enough.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556016,"While Mama Bear was in surgery at the Vets to get her knee repaired, LoGear and I headed to Patapsco State Park to do an approx 7 mile loop with about 400 feet of elevation gain. The day was perfect and the bikers and hikers were scattered throughout the day. The temps were in the high 60s and a warm breeze was flowing through the forest. We parked at our normal place and headed down the trail. It was weird not having a leash in my hands and we constantly reflected how strange it is to come here without Mama Bear.We worked our around our normal loop, with a few changes, but instead of heading back at the connector trail, we continued down to the Cascade trail to make it a bigger loop.We took a couple breaks along the way. These are always short, but refreshing nonetheless. We finished back where we started and had the strong feeling that this is near our starting limit of distance, for now.Luckily, we plan on starting off slow in Georgia with plenty of days at this length until we firm up our bodies a bit and gain some trail legs.When we got home, both of us were a little sore. Now, we just need to figure out how to take our hot tub along with us as a nice soak after the hike was very restorative. I tested out putting our new doTERRA Deep Blue cream on my feet and I must say it really makes them feel special after a day of pounding on the trail under load.Here is what we learned:Both of us will need to build our mileage up slowly again. It isn't what it used to be, but I feel confident we can build it up again rather quickly. As long as we don't go too far too soon. This hike was about three hours. If this is going to be our ""day"", we will need to take longer breaks or start later. Sitting in camp for too long isn't our thing, but naps are nice any time of day. We get antsy sitting around.I need to take pictures, even on practice hikes. I didn't take any on this hike, but should have. After a decent night's sleep, I feel refreshed. I could do it again today, if I needed to. 47 days and counting.Peace,EarthTone and LoGear",,Practice Hike - Full Packs,"Mar 09, Thu",0
EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558452,"We loaded up our packs and headed North to the AT Museum area.  We took the movable Halfway Sign up to Dead Womans Hollow Rd and erected it for the season.  Jen and Tom 




2017 Halfway Point - Dead Womans Hollow Rd.



After that chore was complete, we went back to Shippensburg Rd and started hiking North.  It had rained all the way up from home, but had stopped by the time we arrived in the area.  It was a chilly day with temps on the upper 30s and everything was drippy.




A misty, drippy day



We made our way down to Toms Run shelter, where we would set up our new hammocks and spend the night.  The hike in had been good at an easy 4.8 miles, but we still felt that soreness you get when you first start carrying weight along uneven terrain.  



I took a time lapse video of our antics as we worked to figure out our new gear which was amusing.  I'm glad we did this trip as it was enlightening to say the least.  We are still climbing up the learning curve.




Our hammocks await us



We ate dinner and gathered some wood for a fire, but everything was pretty wet and we were tired enough to not want to fiddle with it much, so we didn't waste the effort.  As the light faded from the misty forest, we both headed to our hammocks to read, then sleep.



My night seemed restless, but I wasn't cold at all.  LoGear didn't fare as well as she said she was shivering all night.  She is ready to go back to her warm, but heavier bag.



Eventually, a Pileated Woodpecker announced the new day.  I opened my eyes and saw dawn had arrived.  



We slowly got up, made some breakfast and packed up.  LoGear headed out first as I was puttering around, in no hurry.



She was motivated by the hot tub and warm bed back waiting at home as we headed back the way we had come the day before.



We quickly got back to the truck and started for home.  Both of us sore and tired.  This was a good dose of what we will have to face on our hike and even though we didn't get actively rained on, we were able to experience some less than ideal weather.   



We will now make our final decisions on gear, finish up our food bags and Fontana resupply and be ready for the start of our Quest.






As always, we will stay flexible and make any needed changes to gear and technique as we start the Adventure.  25 more days until the Quest for Pamola starts.

I also noticed my first blister when I was changing my socks.  It was on my outer heel and not painful at all. 
Once again, we slowly made our way up and I used musical motivation to finish again. We arrived at camp and Brad, Eileen and Maggie were there setting up.  We found some good trees, set up, ate dinner and made a fire.  I showed the others the PCT method of bear bagging and Lisa showed them what poison Ivy looks like as they had tied their rope to a tree that had it growing on it.  We watched the sun set, put out the fire and went to our perspective beds, feeling happy to be out here.

Rattle, rattle, rattle.  That was the sound my tarp was making as the winds roared through the camp.  After such a peaceful sunset, the winds had arrived right around the time I had falllen into a pleasant slumber.  The temp had also dropped quite a bit.  I got out once to make sure my stakes were holding and to chase down my clothes which had blown down and again when LoGear suggested that we should strike the tarps since it was clear out.  We slid the tarps into their snake skins and that helped some, but most of the night was restless with the still roaring wind and the cold.  My underquilt didn't seem to be doing its job and even though I wasnt cold per se, I could feel the cold clawing at me.
Morning arrived and we all slowly crawled out of our beds, made bfast, packed up and headed out.  
Today was going to be challenging, but not impossible. We were trying to get to thw shelter close to Dicks Creek Gap, where we hope to be whisked back to the matrix for some rest and resupply.  There were several ups and downs, as usual, with an 800 foot climb and descent at the end of the day.
The five of us would leap frog each other all day along with Yves, an older frenchman who speaks little to no english, but is a nice guy.  We mostly communicate with hand gestures and the few words I remember from freshman French and his few words of English.
Tray Mtn was our highest peak of the day, with some decent views.  I was able to try out my app, Viewranger the superimposes markers of mountains and other landmarks. It was cool.  
I was slow today.  My feet are unhappy that I am pounding them each day, all day.  The down hills are more painful than the ups, but by the end of the day, they are screaming for to just stop already.
We arrived at the shelter after five.  Happy to be done for the day.  We set up then ate dinner at the table.  A man and his several kids came in for an overnight.  They are a very efficient unit. Each doing a job as they set up, prepared dinner and gathered wood for a fire. Two other hikers came in later that we had met at Blue Mtn yesterday.  
I went to my hammock after eating to rest and read some and pretty much just passed out. My body had had enough.
It's now 0530 on day 8 and I have just had the best night's sleep of the Quest. The wind stayed away last night and the deep gap is calm and silent. I'm ready for a nero day and a Hostel stay.
We have just 3.6 to walk to the Gap and the Hostel is just .5 down the road.

I had an intersting conversation with Pocahontas, one of the kids from the family. She told me all her brothers and sisters trailnames.
We were first out again.  We took the short side trail to the vista on Powell Mtn and had a nice view.  By the time we got to Dicks Creek Gap, the five of us were together.  Honeybuns, Cheesie and Nimeria were headed to Hiawassee for a zero and we were headed to the Top of Georgia Hostel.  The TOG van showed up quick and Odometer, the driver said they had a couple of bunks left but they were filling up fast.  We checked in and met Bob and Carrie, got our showers, changed into provided scrubs and turned in our laundry for cleaning.
We took the shuttle into Haiwassee and ate lunch at the mexican restaurant with Ken, Cool Breeze and Mike.  Cool Breeze amazed us by picking up the check.  We next walked about .6 to the Ingles to shop for resupply.  We probably got too much food, but it isn't too bad.
We hung out until the shuttle picked us up and then finished sorting our food and repacking our clean clothes.  There were lots of hikers there.  Barb (now trailname Life) showed up as did Emily and Kasie. 
We talked and laughed and ate until about 8 when I realized I was tired.
Tomorrow we expect rain amd some cold temps.  We take each day as given.

Floating on air.
People started moving around 6 and I got up and started getting my stuff together out on the porch. I weighed my pack after loading it up, and it was 31 lbs.  Not bad with about five days of food. We went into the main area for breakfast and Bob was giving his talk with lots of good advice for hikers. 
LoGear, Life and I caught the 0800 shuttle back to the trail with several others and we headed up the trail
The Hostel was full last night and was all booked up today too due to an impending storm that was due to arrive.  Sitting in a hostel for another day to avoid Mother Nature's weather was not our style, so hike we did.
The weather was actually perfect for hiking.  Overcast with a slight breeze, but no rain yet.  We thought we would get a couple miles in before the storm hit.
We hiked for almost six miles before we felt the first drops and they never got worse than a sprinkle until just before getting to the shelter. 
At 9 miles, we crossed the border from GA to NC. We took our pictures and Life made a short video for her kids. 
After Bly Gap we had about 900 feet to climb before getting to the shelter, so we went at it slow and steady.  It would be steep for a time, then level off, then go down some, before climbing again.  The wind steadily picked up as we moved higher and the storm threatened to start.  I kept throwing pieces of buttermilk ranch pretzels into the forest as an offering to Pamola to spare us until we were done hiking.
We filled up our water at a spring right before the shelter and headed in, just as the rain picked up.  The storm had arrived with us at the shelter.
LoGear decided to sleep in the shelter.  I don't have my pad yet and wanted to sleep in my hammock anyway, so I set up my tarp first, using it to block the rain and then put up the hammock under the protection of the tarp.  It worked pretty well. I put on pretty much all my clothes as it is supposed to get cold tonight and got everything ready in the hammock. I had purchased a space blanket at the Hostel and spread it out in the double liner under me.  It appears to be working well so far.
In the shelter tonight are LoGear, Life, Nicole and her dog Leo and Bruno.  There are a couple campers out in their tents and I'm snug in my hammock as the rain falls on the tarp and the wind gusts.
We  made our best time today, hiking 11.8 miles in 7 hours and 29 minutes. My feet didn't hurt as much as two days ago.  Maybe our bodies are starting to get used to this constant pounding.
Tomorrow we might try for a 12.5 mile day two shelters down, or we will stop earlier if we aren't up to it.

We all got up and got ready for the days work.  A possible 12.5 miles to Carter Gap shelter. LoGear and I headed out after Jack and Morgan.  We moved along well in the light sprinkle. We made our way past Chunky Girl trail and started up Standing Indian Mtn. We came quickly to the shelter and sat for a rest and lunch.   Fia and Life stopped too.
We had to get moving to keep warm.  The rain has stopped and the sun actually came out for about 30 seconds.  We got a quick view on Standing Indian Mtn and then we were socked in.  We made our way down and continued the days hike.  It wasn't too bad, but more sun would have been nice.  
During the last leg of the day, I was hiking alone behind LoGear.  A bird flew out near my feet and moved into the underbrush on the other side of the trail.  I looked to my right and there was a nest of eggs in a stump.  I saw this two more times before arriving in camp. It was a small grey bird that I didn't recognize. This was in one of the burned areas.
We arrived at the shelter as the rain was starting again and a hunting dog with radio collars on was hanging out.  LoGear has been fussing with her all evening.  They even tried to call the Vet listed on her collar. We gave her some of our food.
Dinner, drying, etc. The usual camp chores.  LoGear is in the shelter with about 5 others and I'm out in the yard again.  It supposed to get cold again tonight.

One by one we headed out.  The coon hound was still there and LoGear gave her more of her food. 
LoGear left before me and I followed after finishing my business.  I found her at a view, crying. She was upset about the dog, which I dubbed Lucy. She seems like a Lucy.  I expressed my hope that her owners will find her and she will be ok.  She would be upset for a couple more miles, but would soldier on.  
In my mind, Lucy will be ok.  I think she knows she can get fed there and visits regularly.  I know I have read about these dogs hanging out at shelters before.
We made our way up Albert Mtn. Very near the 100 mile mark.  We ate lunch. Sat in the sun.  Waited for Life and Bruno to catch up.  We talked to a nice Sobo who was finishing up his hike after taking off the winter.
We worked through the next six miles pretty easily and soon were weaving our way down a valley to the shelter site. Life and Bruno had continued on to the road to get a ride into town.  Life has to stay until Monday when the post office opens again.
The shelter area is ok.  There isn't a covered area at this shelter. I think it was damaged by a tree. It is also on a slope with a few tent pads leveled out.  We found some good trees up the hill and set up.  Of course the rain had arrived.
We both laid in our hammocks and I am trying out an emergency blanket burrito and I'm actually hot now, after shivering a little when the rain was coming down. 
There is a group of weekenders hiking along with us and now there are tents everywhere. I decided I didn't feel like cooking, so I just ate some salami and fritos.  Ahh, Saturdays on the AT.

I awoke around midnight, seeing the moon casting shadows on the tarp.  I got out to look at it and water the tree and noticed the burrito doesn't let my moisture escape and my quilt was a moist mess.  I altered my set up and continued my nightly rest. 
Morning came with the call of some bird. It was a distinct song that was pleasant, about six stanzas long. We packed up as usual and headed out.  Just one hump to hump and we were at the Gap.  There were a couple other hikers there and we all waited for Ron Haven to arrive.  Not too long later, there he was.  We all piled on and enjoyed a pleasant ride into town.  Ron has a great monologue on the drive and had some great information to bestow on us.  Most touching was his tribute to Baltimore Jack and what had transpired on his last days.  It was something that was special to hear.  
We arrived at the Budget Inn and checked in with Sly  of ALDHA renown.  We headed to our room for a shower, then hit the laundry to freshen our reeking clothes.
We were hungry, so we headed to Martha's Kitchen for some AYCE lunch.  It was great and after filling ourselves, we headed to the Lazy Hiker Brewery for a couple beers, signed the sign and then headed to the Ingles for some resupply.
We headed back to the room to sort our shit and get ready for the morrow.
It looks like five days to Fontana.  I probably have too much food still, but that leaves me room to share.  
Our Tramly is down to two right now, but we hope to see some of those behind us again.

Mmm, breakfast bowls.
Our shuttle didn't leave until 10, so we fiddled about, in no hurry. I went over to the outfitter store and bought a canister of fuel.  I also purchased and printed out our Smokys permits.  We are committed now.  We should be heading up there in about five days
Before the shuttle left, Ron told a story of Standing Indian Mtn and how a Cherokee chief was up there and was struck by lightning and turned to stone.  I'm hearing so many cool stories on this adventure. 
We got back to the trailhead at 1030 and headed up the mountain.  It was an easy day and even with the late start, we would make our 11 miles before 1730.  The terrain wasn't too bad, but there were a couple of long climbs to the balds.
We ate lunch at the bottom of Siler Bald.  We didn't feel like climbing to the top, which was a bit of a climb. Lazy hikers.
We leaped frogged a couple other hikers all day. Wayah Bald was a nice rest stop.  The views went on forever.  
After that, it was an easy 0.9 walk down to the shelter area.  I was actually the first to arrive, but had to go get water down the blue blaze.  
We found some good spots and set up.  The area filled up fast as hiker after hiker came in. Fia is here as is Nichol and Leo. The others are new. Some we first met yesterday at Winding Stair Gap, others we are just seeing now.

My canister finally bit the dust, so 18 was the magic number.  I will make sure I start looking for a new canister when I hit 15 burns.
We headed out at 0820. The track was pretty nice as we headed down then up again.
We stopped at Cold Spring Shelter for a snack and rest, then went a couple more miles to Rocky Bald for lunch.  We ate by the trail and then headed up the .1 to the view.
Fia came down just before we headed up and Grade School was up there eating.  We chatted a bit, enjoyed the view and then went back down to contunue the day's hike.
Coming down to Tellico Gap, we were both hurting, but when we got down there we got a nice surprise.  Sled Dog was there with donuts, cookies, water and beer.  He is with two other friends, where one drives the truck and the other two hike. They trade off who is doing what every few days. I had a donut and a Shock Top and I motored right up that mountain to Wesser Bald.  
We climbed the tower and enjoyed another spectacular view.  There was a local couple up there who were telling me what was what. I was even able to get the ViewRanger to work.  We thought we could see part of Fontana Lake.  We also met the two other guys, Sled Dog's friends.  Flash and Slick.
We continued down towards the Shelter, getting water at a nice spring fed cistern.  It was still relatively early, so we weighed the possibility of contining on, possibly as far as the Rufus Morgan Shelter, but decided to stay.  This 10.6 was the planned  mileage for the day, so we are on schedule. 
We set up, rested, then made dinner in the shelter.  We met Moonshine, another prospective Thru.
It feels a little warmer tonight, but I won't let that lull me into not preparing for a cold night.
Tomorrow we pass through the NOC and then climb out of that Valley of the Midday Sun for a hopefully 12.6 mile day.

I woke up with my shirt soaked in sweat.  I guess sometimes preparing for the cold can be a little overkill, but I adjusted.
We got out of camp before 08 and started the long downhill to the NOC. We had visions of burgers and beers to entice us.
It started out ok. Not too bad, but six miles of anything can suck after awhile. Eventually we came down into the NOC.
LoGear had found a dropped Go Pro on the way down so the first thing we did was ask the hikers if anyone was missing a piece of gear. One guy asked if it was a camera and we said yes.  He said a guy was asking and took me to him.  He was very grateful and gave LoGear a hug when he met her.
We ordered big burgers in the River's Edge restaurant, sitting in the back patio area with the river rushing by right outside. I had two pints of their Noon Day IPA and it all was delicious.
Next we picked up some tortillas at the general store and then headed across the river to sit by some picnic tables and soak our feet in the cold river.  We ended up spending two hours and 15 minutes at the NOC.
Eventually, it was time to head out of the valley.  We started up and at first it was ok, but again, this was going to be six miles. We soldiered on and eventually we got up and then headed down to the shelter.  My feet were throbbing at the end and are still hurting now.
This was a good day and our longest so far.  Tomorrow should be an easier one and my feet are ready for an easier day.
Someone built a fire, so we sat around that for awhile.

After my usual cup of Joe and a quick breakfast, I headed out just as LoGear was finishing packing up.  I mozzied along until she caught up.  We slowly made our way up to Cheoah Bald. The view was decent, but some clouds were rolling in.
Continuing on, we slowly descended into Stecoah Gap.   The last bit seemed to take forever.  We ate lunch at the picnic tables and I called the Fontana Lodge to make a reservation for tomorrow night.  I asked for two doubles, just in case we find a couple hikers that might want to share.
We started to climb again, because what goes down has to go up again.  This time our challenge was Jacobs Ladder. This is a very steep section that goes up 600 ft in .6 of a mile.  It was hard, but we just stuck at it until we were at the top.  It was also good that once finished, our short day of the section would be complete in a few tenths of a mile.  We came into the empty shelter. All of the others we started with today, were going further.
My feet were telling me that we had gone far enough for the day. Tomorrow will be 11.6 for the day, with a room waiting for us at the Lodge.

As things go out here, we finally arrived at our final downhill and I fell behind doing my slow ramble. Finally, I could see the road at the Marina, where we could call a shuttle for a $3 ride to the resort. Just as I took my last step onto the road, the shuttle comes pulling into the parking lot and stops in front of LoGear asking if she had called for the shuttle. She said no, but we needed one.  
The whipper snappers had made the call, so we let them board first, but we were whisked off to the Lodge to check in, take showers, walk down to the General store area to mail off some extra gear, eat ice cream, shop for some resupply and do laundry.  It started raining as we walked down the road and came down pretty hard while we sat on the porch and watched.
When all that was done and the rain had let up, we went to dinner and are now relaxing in the room.

We took our time as today was going to be a short one. We eventually checked out around 1000 after a nice breakfast and the shuttle took us back to the trail.
The first mile was really nice following the shoreline of the lake. We came to the Fontana Hilton and saw a couple of hikers hanging around.  We continued on to the Visitor Center and got our passports stamped.
We crossed the dam and started up the road. We had entered the Great Smoky Mountains. The road continued to rise above the lake until we turned into the woods and dropped our permit halves into the box.
The climb was steady, but not real steep. We just took our time since we didn't have far to go.  We saw a nice view at Open Ledges, but when we got to Shuckstack fire tower the fog was rolling in.  I dropped my pack and walked up the .1 to the top.  The ruins of the old cabin were cool, but the view was all white.  I went back down and we ate lunch at the trail junction.
Scrambles and The Grouch ate there lunch there and we pretty much stayed together until we turned off at the camp and the girls continued on to the next shelter.
We checked out the camp and I really liked it.  Good water flowing and we found some decent trees on one of the pads. Bear cables for our food bags. There was also a nice fire ring and since it was still early, we started collecting some wood.
We set up, relaxed and then went over to the fire ring to make dinner and a small fire.  It was good.
I had a really good hike today.  I seemed a little faster and felt terrific all day.  Doing only 7.4 miles probably had a lot to do with it, but I might be getting some trail legs finally.

We packed up and headed out and just did our thing.  The terrain was good and just took each hill as it came.
I saw a nice area to do my morning's business and went up to dig my cat hole and make a deposit.  All went as planned to spare you the details and I headed back to the trail and continued on.  About a mile later, I realized that I had left my tent stake at the cat hole.  
Oh well, I thought.  I'll either find another one before I need it again, or use a rock, like I do all the time in PA and MD. I thought to myself.  The trail will provide.
About an hour later, LoGear says, there's your tent stakes.  Sitting along the side of the trail was a green bag of, you guessed it, tent stakes.  Since this was certainly someone's lost gear, I wrapped them up and put them in my pack. It was time to an agent of Karma again.
We continued on and saw a couple hikers along the way. Today didn't really have any vistas, so we looked close in the forest for today's VOD.  Some ferns were casting a nice shadow of themselves, so I snapped that and called it today's view.
We arrived in camp early in the day again and claimed our places in the shelter.  19 days without sleeping in a shelter and now it was time. We have to sleep in the shelters in the Smokys unless they are full.
Vicky is here again and three others on a section hike.  Let's see if anyone else shows up.
Tomorrow we will either do 11.8 or 13.5. If we can go the extra 1.7, it will shorten the next day's hike.

A number of hikers had come in around 2130-2200. Some came into the shelter and others just tented.
We are starting to get used to our routine and were out on the trail shortly after 07.
We headed up Rocky Top for a nice view and continued on. On the way up we heard a couple gobbles and saw a Tom right next to the trail.  We also saw a couple of bunnies.
Todays hike had a number of ups and downs, but nothing too  hard or long.
The original plan for today was an 11.8 mile day, but we decided to go to the next shelter which was close.  This would reduce tomorrow's mileage to a more reasonable 13.4 instead of 15.1.
LoGears feet were hurting but we made it no problem.
There are a number of people here. Some familiar, some new.  We might have a fire tonight.

There were no heavy snorers in the shelter.  I slept longer between rotisseries.
We packed up and were out just after 07. There was a doe hanging out by the shelter last night and she was still there when we headed out.  No fear. One if the guys said she was hurt.
We moved along good and before too long we were on our way up Clingmans Dome.  The slope wasn't too steep.  We came to the side trail to the parking area.  It was .3 on the AT to the tower and .6 to the parking lot.  We wanted to dump our trash and maybe get a soda at the visitor's center.  Since we would have to do another .5 after the lot, up to the Dome, we deemed it an authorized blue blaze. 
We took the trail, dumped our trash in the lot and saw we were too early for the visitors center.
He headed up, climbed the tower, then continued on up Mt Carter where we ate lunch.
My lunch turned out to be pbj with pine needles and sticks when it flipped off my lap and hit the ground.  I scraped off the extra ingredients and added fritos.
We came down into Newfound Gap and there were muggles everywhere. We hung out for awhile, but no one fed us. We did get asked a bunch of the usual questions though.
We continued on towards the shelter and passed a lot of the muggles along the way. I saw a couple just standing by a side trail and looking at something on the traol.  I came up and saw that it was a mama grouse playing hurt on the trail. It fluttered there for a minute while I took a photo, then got up and walked into the brush.  I looked around for the babies that must have been hiding nearby, but couldn't see any.
We took one last break at a view then headed for the shelter.
There were a few people already there and more would roll in every couple of minutes.  When we had more than 12, we set up our hammocks.  I'm very happy to be sleeping by myself on air again.
Tomorrow we have an easy 12.1 miles. We are over halfway done with the Smokys.

We hiked on.  Today's hike had several nice views and wasn't too strenuous.  We are generally heading to lower elevation, but there were plenty of ups too.
We made 7.2 by lunch and were walking into the shelter area around 1530. 
LoGear was running low on fuel.  She will have to pay more attention on her calories.  I still have a lot of stored energy, so it isn't hitting me as hard.
The day usually goes with a slow start to warm up, then qe trudge out a few quick miles until lunch. After lunch, I seem to be slow for awhile then I do ok.  The last mile or two, I just grind out at a steady pace until we get to the shelter.

The trail was fantastic today.  At times a pine needle carpeted path. We made very good time and were at the shelter 7.7 miles away a little after 10.  
We are an early lunch. Mmm, mayo, hot sauce, bacon bits, cheese and Fritos on a tortilla. Then headed out for phase two of the day.
After continuing to make good time, we decided to evaluate our bodies at the shelter and possibly push on to Standing Bear.
LoGear saw a black snake along the way and I came across one basking on the trail a little later.
We arrived at the shelter and still felt good, so we decided to move on.
We came down to I-40 and did a little riad walk. After that it headed up the hillside and that last mile was the hardest of the day.  We had descended to about 1800 feet and the temp down here was in the upper 80s with some high humidity. Up in the Smokys, it was cooler and dryer.
We arrived at the Hostel and grabbed a bunk.  Next it was showers, hand washed laundry, pizza and a beer. Later we did a short resupply in their little store. 
They have a scale here and LoGear said she lost 15 lbs and I have lost 25.  Not too shabby.
Mouse King, Tiger and Gnome showed up later and there were a couple other hikers at the hostel, including a couple Sobos.
Tomorrow should be an easy short day to the first shelter.  There is rain in the forecast, but I won't complain. After the wonderful weather we had in the Smokys, it is time for some rain.

Everyone eventually got up and we did our morning routine. We headed out just after 08.  Rain was in the forecast for the day.  
We had originally planned just ab easy 6.9 day as we climb back up on elevation, but had discussed moving on from there either 13 miles or 15 depending on how we felt.
The day was pleasant early on and we made our way up Snowbird Mtn.  Just as we got up there, a short rain storm started.  We headed back to the woods and after 20 minutes the rain stopped.
We stopped at Groundhog Creek Shelter for lunch.  Mouse King and Tiger were there too.  It was way too early to stoo for the day, so we elected to keep going.
As we walked along,we started to hear thunder.  It started raining shortly after and kept getting harder and harder.  
Since it was pretty warm out, we didn't put on our rain jackets, we just co tinued on and got wet. My ziplock for my guide must have more holes in it as the book got a little wet, but not too bad.
After about 45 minutes or so, it started slacking off and another 20 or so, the sun was trying to come out again.
By the time we got to Max Patch, it was very pleasant out again.  We walked along the Patch and enjoyed the view.  
I was ready to get my wet shoes and socks off, so we continued on to the shelter.  Mouse King, Tiger, Ham Jam and Packman were there and Gnome came in later. 
We found some good spots and set up.  Dinner at the shelter and some good conversation, then it was time to relax in the hammock.  
Tomorrow looks like a 14.7 to get to the shelter near town. Then it's a qui nearo.

We packed up and were out before 08.  This morning didn't start with a climb so we moved along nicely.  We were walking along, mostly keeping our eyes on our footing, LoGear was in front, me right behind. I looked up and there was a wide eyed deer looking at LoGear.  I said look and she moved off the trail.
We got to Walnut Mtn Shelter around 10 and had an early lunch. After that we climbed our second mtn of the day, Bluff Mtn.  Coming down was some good track and we made good time.  
We thought that the rest of the day would be easier with some short ups and downs, but a couple of them were a little tough. When we were about 1/2 a mile or so from the shelter, I was in front. I heard a rattle behind me and to my left.  It was a beautiful rattle snake that had let me pass, but had had enough when LoGear passed.  Of course we took pics. We soldiered through and arrived at the shelter at 1530.
As usual, we set up, rested, got water and made dinner.  Packman and Ham Jam are here. The rest moved on to town, I guess.
There are also a group of scouts behind the shelter and a couple of them were hanging out talking with us.
A couple of older Gals rolled into camp just before I came to my hammock.  They had started in Mar, but had to get off trail for injuries.

We headed out before and just cruised down the mountain to the town.  It was drippy out, with some sprinkles, but not too bad.  We got down and right next to the trail is the Hostel at Laughing Heart.
We got a private room, showered and got ready to head out for lunch.  The rain was pretty heavy as we headed down the road.  
We arrived drenched at the Spring Creek Tavern. Had some good burgers and a beer (after Noon).  We checked out the outfitters then headed to the Dollar General to start our resupply.  Next we finished off at the Hillbilly Market and headed back to the Hostel.  
Laundry is almost done and we are hanging out with the other hikers on the porch.  Good times.

We got our stuff together and headed over to the Smoky Mtn Diner for bfast.  It was good and we hit the trail at 0830.
They had a scale at the Hostel, so we checked our packs. With 5 days of food and 1 liter of water each, mine was 33 and LoGear's was 34.  We will hopefully be lightening up soon. Sending our cold gear and sleeping pads home, but for now, we carry them.
After leaving town and walking along the swollen French Broad River for a bit, the trail starts heading up.  We made our way to higher elevation, passing Lover's Leap rock, our only semi-view of the day.
As we went up, the rain started coming down. It only fell hard for a few minutes, then slackened off and after awhile, only the trees were dripping.
The sun actually tried to come out a few times. We ate lunch by an old dammed pond halfway up the mountain.  We wondered who had put in the strange concrete dam some time ago and why.
We decided to walk up to the lookout tower on Rich Mtn, but you couldn't go up into the observation area, because there were holes in the floor.  We came down and continued on.
The final push up Spring Mtn wasn't too strenuous and we arrived at the shelter just before 1530.
Tonight the area is full of hikers we don't know.  They are mostly people who went to Trail Daze. 
I'm mostly sitting in my hammock as it helps my back.  It keeps hurting when I stand, so that sucks.
This is really the first day that I was kind of low for most of the day.  I blame it on my back and I know there will be plenty more low days, but I'm happy it took 27 days for it to happen.

I probably have another day or two until it's  back to normal though.
We packed up and were on the move at 0815. As usual the morning was a comfortable pace as we headed mostly down. 
After a short break about four miles in, we decided to try for the next shelter for lunch.  The rain started just before Noon and we were pretty wet by the time we got to the shelter.  We ate and continued on.  A girl at the shelter read us the weather report.  It was a pretty wet forecast.  
The rain would go off an on for the rest of the day.  I was pretty much soaked through all day.  There was a weather bypass around Big Firescald Knob and we took it.  The main route had some rock scrambles and with everything wet, we decided to go the safer route.
While on that route I slipped on a rock as I tried to catch myself with my poles, the right one went down a hole and I went down. The pole had a 70 degree bend on the bottom piece.  Needless to say, it broke off when I bent it back. I was still able to use it, but it looks like I need to get to a Walmart soon, or maybe the trail will provide me one.
A little later I was walking behind LoGear and I saw something move from around her feet.  It was two baby birds that must have been hiding on the trail.  They scurried past me and their mother started calling from the nearby thick brush.  LoGear said it sounded like a hurt dog.
We got back to the AT and the trail was pretty nice for the last couple of miles. I was in my end of day push, but LoGear was getting cold.
We arrived at the shelter just as the rain was picking up again and had to set up in the rain.  We just put up the tarp first, then work underneath it.  My pack and hiking clothes are still soaked, but I'm warm and mostly dry in my hammock at the end of another successful day on the trail.
As I was sitting under my tarp watching the rain, I saw the water spills off my tarp every so often.  I was able to fill up my water bottle with the fresh rain water.
I was glad after I saw a couple guys come back from the water source with yellow looking water.
Tomorrow we do 15.5. I hope it is a dryer day.

My semi dry socks were wet in a minute and would stay that way all day. I saw a woodpecker poking at the tree near my hammock and watched him awhile.
We headed out a little after 08 and did our first climb. It wasn't very long and we made good time for the first few miles. There was a stiff breeze and the sun did try to come out a few times, but it didn't quite dry the clothes punned to my pack.
We stopped for lunch at the shelter. It seemed like it was going to be a niceish day. Boy, was I wrong about that.
We headed down hill to cross a few roads. There were a lot of snails on the trail. I guess they like wet weather. I also saw a mouse dart across the trail and disappear in the middle. When I got to that point, I saw the small hole he had ducked into.
When we hit the roads, a vulture was on some roadkill and the rain began. We had a long climb to do and as we headed up, the rain kept getting harder and harder. Before very long, we were both drenched to the bone. Any drying our clothes had done during the day was erased.
When we neared the top, near Lick Rock, the rain finally stopped and the sun actually came out.  We had a nice view there, the first in three days.
We were a little chilled from being wet and the wind was blowing, but we kept moving to Keep warm and finish the day.
We arrived at the shelter before 1700, ready to get our wet clothes off. There were lots of people here that we hadn't seen before.  We set up, got water and got into dry clothes.  Just as we were going to cook dinner it started to rain again. 
We moved under my tarp, but LoGear got splashed alot as the rain came down and spilled off the tarp.  We retired to our hammocks until there was a lull, then I put our food bags up on the cable.

We were hoping for a decent day, but that was not to be.
The morning was ok.  A little cold, but we kept warm by moving. We had a decent view at the first hill top, but could see Big Bald where we would be soon and it was covered in cloud.
We stopped for lunch on some rocks halfway up the Mtn and it startrd to sprinkle.  We packed ip quick and hit the trail.
The wind picked up as we climbed higher and the sprinkles continued. We came to another weather bypass of the summit and decided to take it. On this section we have taken all three bypasses offered. This has definitely been our most challenging section so far. Four days of shitty weather maked me cranky.
After the bypass we still had to cross a bald area and the wind was wicked. It was actually blowing me sideways at times.
We continued down into slightly sheltered forest, but now had to deal with slippery mud in a few places.  LoGear went down first and I had a slow fall a lite later.
We came to the shelter and there were only two people there. Pixey and Blaze who had both passed us earlier.  We were contemplating calling it a day, so we could stay in the shelter and get warm and dry.  And that is what we are doing.

At lunch, we decided that a zero was in order.  We just hoped that we could get a bunk or hammock space.  I thought it would be a regular Friday business, but Ham Jam reminded me that it was Memorial Day weekend.  
We continued on as the weather became perfect.  It was warm and the breeze was refreshing and not chilling, but I didn't care.  I just wanted to get down this damn mountain.
As we started our final descent, I decided to put on some music and it really helped me notice how beautiful the day had become and I was able to finish strong.
I arrived at the Hostel right at 1600 and asked about a bunk/cabin/hammock space. She said they were all booked, but I could check the hammock space to see if there was any room. I checked and there was, so we checked in and set up.  
We took a quick shower and got ready for the 1730 shuttle to Walmart and a couple restaurants.  
We ate at the Italian place, got a six pack and walked through Walmart planning our resupply for tomorrow.  I wasnt sure how many days we needed yet, so we decided to come back tomorrow.

When we came back, I took a little nap in the hammock and awoke refreshed.
We took the Walmart shuttle, had a margarita and nachos at the Mexican restaurant, then finished our resupply at the Walmart.
Back at the hostel, we relaxed into the evening.  The forecasted rain never showed up during the day, but a good storm blew through overnight.
It was a very good and much needed zero. Tomorrow we head north. Not sure how far. Most likely 12.3 to a campsite.

The trail was pretty nice heading out of Erwin. It rose above the river gradually, with only a few steep climbs.
As we were walking along the river, a guy caught up to us and asked if we would give a guy he was hiking with some food as he thrust a couple of cinnamon pinwheels and a granola bar in my hand. He said the guy hadn't eaten in two days and he had hiked on into the night without him. He showed me a photo of him.  I said sure.
We stopped for a break at the first shelter. Sprout was there doodling in the register. Her hiking partner was sick, so she said they were probably zeroing there for the day. We asked if she had seen the guy and she said she thinks he stayed at the shelter last night.
LoGear had been dragging all morning. I could tell she was having a hard time. I asked if she wanted to go home and she said yes.  She is just missing her girls too much and doesn't like being this seperated and out of touch with them. It was weighing her down and affecting her hike.  It was time for her part in this Quest, this adventure, to change.
I went into protect my baby mode and started figuring out how I could get her to a bus station and get her home.  I figured we could use the shuttle services of one of two hostels that we would be passing in a day or two.
We stopped for lunch halfway up the mountain and I took my phone out of airplane mode to check for signal and I amazingly had some.  I sent a quick text to Miss Janet, the best Trail Angel I know, who happens to live in Erwin.  She responded back in a few minutes that she would be at the gap in an hour or so.
 We walked the 1.4 miles down to the gap. On the way I was able to book a space on a Greyhound leaving Johnson City tomorrow. 
Shortly after we got to the gap, Miss J pulled up with a couple of hikers that were heading out from there. They kindly took the food for the hungry hiker to attempt that side-quest for us.
We headed north first and picked up three more hikers and then headed to Johnson City where we hit an AYCE Chinese place that had us pigging out before checking into an Econolodge next door.  Miss J and the hikers headed to Damascus where they would continue their hike.  
We checked in and I had my third shower in three days. LoGear got her pack ready for a bus ride and I started to plan my next few days of hiking.
Miss Janet will be coming to pick me up in the morning and take me back to the Gap and LoGear will now be home base.  Her 350 miles of experience will help a lot in knowing what I am going through and what I need.
It has been very special having my Bride with me for the beginning of this Quest. Her Adventure was to help me get this far. Now, her supporting me from home base puts my worries at ease as she has had plenty of experience doing that when I was deployed in the Coast Guard and it only strenthens my resolve to continue this Quest.
The Adventure continues...

We Ubered over to the bus station and went inside. 
John, the dispatcher helped us get everything sorted and we just waited for the bus to arrived.  
It came basically on time and before I knew it, my baby was gone. I waited outside for a bit and Miss Janet drove up and whisked me back to the trail.
After getting dropped off, I put on my pack and took about five minutes to get going.  I just stood there feeling like I was forgetting something. I realized that what I was missing was LoGear. I no longer had anyone to say ""those mountains aren't going to climb themselves"" to. I was alone.
I finally started to get my rhythm going and made my way up to Beauty Spot.  It was nice and had a cool view. Next I started up Unaka Mtn. On the way up I stopped for lunch at a campsite. There was a guy there hanging out. I went over to say hi and saw he had a familiar looking walking stick. 
It looked like the BohDi sticks we award the inductees into the AT Museum's Hall of Fame. I asked him about it and he confirmed it was made by Bodacious. They are friends.  His name is Jim.
I headed on after taking his picture and entered the enchanted spruce forest at the top of the mountain.  I had some good track coming down the mtn and made decent time.
I arrived at the shelter at 1441. It was too early to stop, so I went on another 4.3 miles. At 1650 I arrived at the campsite that used to be an apple orchard. You could see the old apple trees in the meadow. They are all twisted and rotted, but still alive.
I found a spot near the water and set up. Theresa (Snickers) and her husband Rob came in after me and are camped up in the meadow. We met them at Uncle Johnnys the other day.
Dinner is done and I'm now in the hammock relaxing and avoiding the bugs. I'm away from the others, alone.
Tomorrow I may try for a bigger day, so I can have a shorter one for the next Hostel stop for a small resupply. I'm not sure I will stay there, but we shall see.
I miss my baby already.

I rolled out at 06 and was on the trail at 07. I have a process now and just do one thing after another until I'm ready to hike.
The morning was overcast, but the day felt like it was going to be a good one.
I moved along good towards the first shelter for a break. I followed deer prints on the trail for miles. I guess they use it too.
After the shelter I went up to Little Rock Knob that had a decent view. Next I passed General Hendrix getting water.
I started climbing towards Roan High Knob, the longest climb of the day and stopped most of the way up for lunch at a campsite.  
I felt like I was having the Day Two Blues during the climb. The DTBs are from my section hike days. I would be all hyped up and ready to go on day one, but on day two, I would always ask why I was out there doing this.  It usually passes, but I was really missing my baby during that climb 
I finally reached the top and checked out the place where a large hotel used to be back in the late 1800s.
I started down and didn't bother climbing the .1 to the Shelter, since I figured I could get water along the way.  I did fill in a bit and continued down.
I came out at Carvers Gap where it opened out into a very pretty and large Bald. I climbed over Round Bald, then Jane Bald.
I had some signal on the bald, so I texted LoGear and checked my email.
After another short climb, I headed down hill to the shelter.  I set up and rested a bit. Coach, a guy I passed up on the Bald came in and we had dinner together.
A few other hikers came through, but were headed to Over Mountain Shelter just 1.9 away.
Tomorrow, it's just 11.1 to the Hostel. I think I'm gonna stay the night there tomorrow.

It's an easy system and I can get it done fairly quick. 
Today promised to be a nice one and it did deliver.  I headed down hill for awhile until I saw the turnoff for Over Mountain Shelter. It is a large barn with plenty if space. I didn't go check it out, but got a good view of it as I climbed out of the gap. 
I came along and saw I was going to be entering an open space, so I applied some sunscreen.  I was at the Hump Mtns.  Little Hump was first.  It is completely open and you could see forever.  I saw a couple deer grazing up there. Hump Mtn was also open and I rested at the top of each to take it all in. 
I had some signal, so I texted LoGear Happy Birthday and downloaded my email. It was a perfect day up there.
It was all downhill after that and some of it was pretty rocky, so my feet weren't too happy. On the way down, I left North Carolina for the last time. Two states done, 12 to go, but TN will be done in about five more days.
Eventually, I came to US19 amd walked down the road to the Hostel. It is very nice, but the bunkhouse was full (some hiking group), so I'm camping by the creek. It was cheaper. I got a shower and did some cowboy laundry, while I was in there. Supposedly their Bfast is a great deal. I will confirm in the morning.
Tomorrow, 16.7 planned.

It truly lives up to its hype.  Very good and plenty if it. I ate up and hit the trail before 09.
The track was pretty nice today, with no long or steep climbs.  There were some open meadows I walked through, but the day was mostly a walk in the woods.
The terrain generally rolled up and down with lots of water crossings.
After checking out the impressive Jones Falls, I stopped for lunch when the trail started running beside the Elk River. It was a very pleasant and shady site.  A couple of hikers came by and said they just passed a sign on the ground made of sticks saying it was the 400 mile mark.  I said ""that's funny, I just passed one a couple tenths back."" I would see one more reference to 400 miles on a blaze another tenth north.  (And they say there are a lot of Halfway markers up in PA.) 
The afternoon would be basically the same and at just past 1700 I crossed a stream at the campsite.  
I found a spot, set up, gathered some wood in case I wanted to have a fire (I didn't. Too lazy/tired) and made dinner. A couple came down the trail asking if there were any more sites south and I said no.  They are camping nearby.
This campsite must get used a lot on weekends. There is evidence of poor potty habits here and lots of broken string on all the potential hanging trees, along with foil in the firepit.  I had to hang my food the old way as the tree doesn't look high enough to do a proper pct method hang, but it will do.
Tomorrow I finish this section with another 16.6 to the Boots Off Hostel.

Along the way I came to an old rundown cabin. In the distance, there was a sound I couldn't place. As I came closer, I saw there was a pond and the noise was a bunch of bull frogs.
After having lunch at Laurel Falls, I continued on to the challenge of the day. The last six miles was climbing and descending Pond Mountain.  There were lots of switchbacks, but it was still a bitch.
Eventually I was done for the day and walking up the road to the Hostel. The boys were here and staying the night. Also here were Tripp and Tiger, a dog and her woman, who I had been seeing in the registers for awhile.
I ate a pizza, set up amd got ready for a 1800 shuttle into town. We all went in, hit the Dollar General, then the beer store, then McDs for second dinner.
Back at the Hostel, they started a bonfire and we enjoyed the night. I stayed up way too late.
They have a thing here. It's a five pound Gnome that if you carry it to Damascus and present it to the Broken Fiddle Hostel, you get a night free. Early Bird has accepted the challenge.
Tomorrow should be a little later start for a 15.9 mile day.

The Hostel serves a light bfast, so I headed out after indulging in some of that. 
The trail makes its way up from Watauga Lake and you keep seeing this very long lake almost all day. It was fairly pleasant as I made my way up.
I ate lunch at a small overlook that had a decent view of the lake. I also stopped at a shelter to rest and there was a very good view behind the shelter
In the afternoon, the trail seemed to get a little harder. There was one hill that was steeper and longer than I had thought, but you just keep putting one foot in front of the other and eventually, you get to the top.
The end of the day was the same. My feet were hurting and I just wanted to het to the shelter.  I powered through the last two miles and soon I was at the water source near rhe shelter. I massaged my feet even though I was almost done, then headed to the shelter.
I found a nice spot, set up, then made dinner. Worm and Early Bird showed up shortly after.  Thomas, from Canada came in too. He is low on food, so we gave him some of our extras.
Gazelle also came in and ate, then headed out again. 
I'm ready to catch up on some sleep tonight and get closer to town tomorrow with another 15.9 mile day.

I moved through them. The young ones would come towards me like they thought I was going to give them something and then would shy away. It was cool.
I continued on to the first shelter and had an early lunch. After that it was just walking up and down a bunch of short hills until I was at the shelter.
As I walked, my mind continued to harrass me. It kept asking if I really wanted to do this all summer. I was coming to the realization that the answer might be no.
I'm headed to Damasucus tomorrow, where I will take a zero and see how I feel, but right now I'm about 80% sure that it might be time to get off trail.

As I approached the VA border, I heard the boys from Mass behind me.  We took pics and moved on. I kept pace with them for awhile, and then they moved on as I got some water at the last source.
I came down into the edge of town with a light drizzle falling.  I continued along towards the Post office to pick up my package. 
I called Crazy Larrys to see if he had room and he did. I headed over and checked in. 
There was some drama with General Hendrix that was some bullshit accusations about him stiffing Hostels or something. It got all straightened out and the General was real cool about the whole thing, but the guy who blew up Facebook with the crap was wrong and had to apologize. 
I went to dinner with the Boys at Bo Bo's and when we came out, it was pouring down rain. I had my rain jacket, but still got soaked coming back. My laundry was ready when I got back, so I quickly got into toasty warm and dry clothes.
After it stopped raining, I picked up a six pack and went and hung out at the Broken Fiddle where the Boys were staying.  
Phase I of the Quest for Pamola is complete. It is now time to get off trail, head home and recharge my mental batteries. There are still a lot of different things to do this summer.
The Quest will continue. It has no time limit. I just need to walk the trail from Springer to Katahdin (I'm pretty sure I will connect all my sections together now) then after climbing to Baxter Peak, proceed across the Knifes Edge to Pamola Peak. There I will present the Talisman of the Storm and my Quest will end.
Tomorrow, I will shuttle to Marion, VA, spend another night in another EconoLodge and then take the same bus home LoGear took a little over a week ago.

We sat around on the porch talking and I saw Grade School again, who now has shorter hair. I headed down to the local coffee shop for a cup and sat with her and Arackne and Yard Sale.  On the way back, I saw the Boys from Mass heading out and said bye once again.  
Even though I was done hiking for a time, I still felt the need to walk.  It was much easier walking through town without any weight on my back and it felt good.  I walked all the way out to the Food City, just to buy some deodorant, pretzels and chocolate milk.  It was mainly just to walk, but them having my favorite pretzel pieces was a pure bonus.  My underarms were a little shocked that I tried to spruce them up a bit, but I was preparing my body to sit by strangers for several hours.  I didn't want to be annoying them with my natural smell.

I checked in and settled into the room, preparing my pack for a bus ride instead of a walk in the woods.  I went over to the nearby Walmart and McDonalds to get some beer and the ingredients to make a McGangBang, which Early Bird had taught me to make.  
I watched a couple of episodes of Better Call Saul on my phone with the spotty wifi and went to sleep, content that my Adventure had turned to this and I felt good about it.

I partook of the Motel's continental breakfast and then checked out.  As I headed down the sidewalk, I could see another hiker in front of me a few hundred yards.  He disappeared into the McDs and I continued on.  
I found the bus stop, which was just the back of a heating and AC repair shop.  I was early, so I took a seat outside.  The other hiker came walking up a few minutes later.  His name was Poco, and he was heading off trail to attend a wedding.  We had some nice conversation, comparing who we knew from the trail.  
The bus arrived basically on time and we were off.  Poco transferred at the next stop and I settled in for the long ride home.  When I had first got on, the bus was mostly full.  At least there were no rows that didn't have at least one person sitting in it.  I grabbed a seat and noticed too late that this was one that didn't have an outlet.
At the first stop, I didn't leave anything to mark my seat and when I came back, some lady was sitting in it.  I found another seat, this one with an outlet and settled in.  The dude who was next to me was cool and we continued on.  
I spent the time listening to some book on tape that I found and checked out from my local library.  It helped make the long drive tolerable.  
We transferred to a different bus in Charlottesville, VA and continued on.  This bus was less filled and we pretty much each had our own row to sit in for the rest of the trip.  
In DC, we had to exit the bus again for the layover and it was a little cool out.  I stood in the ticket area to keep warm until it was time to reboard.  
We arrived in Baltimore on time and LoGear was waiting for me in the parking lot.  I threw my pack in the back and was home in about 20 minutes.  
I jumped in the shower (because I could) and headed to bed.  I wondered how my back would appreciate the move from the hammock, but it wasn't bad at all.
Precious welcomed me home, by perching on my belly to suck my warmth from me.  
The next morning I weighed myself on the same scale I had before the hike and I had lost around 31 lbs.  Not too bad.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570805,"Just as we suspected. LoGear and I will be heading back to the Trail after about 30 zero days or so.  The focus of the Quest has evolved.  We will be jumping up to northern VA, skipping about 400 miles of the state.  For now...  We will return and hike VA.  Maybe in the Fall.  Maybe next year.  
We will be heading to Rockfish Gap on July 6th and continue hiking north through Shenandoah National Park.  Once we finish that part, we will take a couple more weeks of zeros, then head up to PA at Lehigh Gap to continue north from there.  Most likely into CT or MA.  Then back home for stuff before most likely doing a few more Pushes into the Fall.
The requirement of the Quest is still the same.  To walk the whole trail, then go to Pamola Peak on Katahdin and present the Talisman of the Storm to Pamola.  I still have many pieces to add to the Talisman as it grows in power.
I have been hiking sections of the Trail for several years now.  I am going to incorporate those miles hiked into this Quest.  LoGear hasn't hiked all that I have, so we will be doing what we can to get her miles in where we can.

We ate our Sheetz sandwiches in the parking lot then headed out.  We took our time along the way, but the terrain was not too bad.  Gentle inclines on good track. The rocks were a little slick, so caution and vigilance was needed to avoid falls.  There were a few other hikers making their way north with us and we would leapfrog all day.
We took plenty of breaks as our bodies were saying, ""What the fuck? Not again!"" After the first few miles, we started feeling the old pains that we are so familiar with.  The fading of the memory of the pain is part of why we came back out, but it didn't take long for the memories to come back. We are both stiff and sore, but also happy to be back on the trail.
The only water today was on the approach to the shelter and I was low when we arrived. Tomorrow looks similar and we hope to do 13 miles.
There are a lot of hikers here tonight, both north and south bounders. Sectioners and long distance hikers. A good mix.
We were hit hard by the difference 30 days make.  The heat and humidity had us soaked through with sweat within the first mile.  We kinda wished it would rain some more.

The trail today was pretty nice. No long or steep climbs until the end of the day. There was a nice breeze blowing about and enough clouds to keep the sun hidden a lot of the time.We still got soaked with sweat during the day, but that is expected in Summer in the mid-atlantic. The pain of yesterday had faded and we started out fresh. We once again took lots of breaks. We were in no hurry and the miles did their thing. I saw a toad on the trail and not much else during the day. As we were starting to get near the shelter, our water was low. I saw on the map that a stream crossed the fire road where we were resting and I headed down to get some water for the final push of the day. I also cleaned up a little and felt refreshed. We finished the day and arrived in camp. I felt better today. My body still needs to get back into the groove, but there was improvement today. We prepared dinner and hung out for awhile at the shelter with the group that we have clustered around. All good people.

I was still up at 06 and we were out after 07 again. After a good climb out from the shelter and up the mountain, the terrain smoothed out again. The Blackrock summit was pretty impressive. A whole hillside of rocks. A lot like near the Washington Monument in MD and Blue Rocks in PA.We dumped trash at Dundo picnic area and headed for Loft Mountain and its camp store. We arrived at lunch and got a sandwich and a beer. We found a few food items in the hiker box and LoGear bought a few things. We took a $1.75 shower and hung out with the other hikers watching the muggles come in and buy firewood and ice. One of the campers named PJ gave us all a beer after chatting with us a while. He was pretty cool. Red Bull came rolling in, which was cool. I had last seen him in Damascus. We caught up and he continued on.We finally headed out, but weren't going far. We headed to the Wayside, which was about a mile down trail and .6 off trail. On the way down the blue blaze LoGear spotted a mamma bear and two cubs. We checked them out for awhile and they faded into the forest. We went down and ordered some more food for dinner, then headed back to the trail. On the way back up the trail, the bears were there again. The momma didn't seemed concerned with us at all. She just treed the babies and slowly put herself between us and the cubs. It was very cool.We made our way the last few miles and arrived at the shelter. We found our trees, set up with a doe grazing at the edge of the field. Also not concerned with us.

We got out of camp a little later than the other days, but still a good time.The shelter maintainer, Larry came in. He has lots of stories. He told us about a nice camping spot about 15 miles out. Since we were pretty sure we wouldn't want to stop early at 8.2 miles, we thought this might be a good place to stop for the night.We made our way along pretty nice, but the climb to the first shelter was pretty steep. When we got there, LoGear said that she was beat and maybe we should stop. After eating lunch, she felt better and we continued on. We stopped for a break at the crossing of US 33 and found some ripe wineberries. Next we stopped at a picnic area and took a long break and cooked dinner. We only had 1.5 to go to this camp, but never found it. We decided to keep going to the Lewis Mtn Campground. We had to pay to camp, but figured 19.8 was enough for today. This basically puts us a day ahead of schedule.As the sun was getting low, we saw a couple of deer near and on the trail. The one on the trail just looked at me as we approached and then finally hopped off the trail about 10 feet.We got to the campground and walked through looking for sites with good trees for our hammocks. We found one and self registered at the entrance.We set up as darkness fell. LoGear can't get her stakes in the ground for her tarp, so lets hope it doesn't rain tonight. As we were setting up, we saw an owl flying around the camp and it landed right above us across the road.  Soon, other members of the owl family came flying up and landing in the trees of the campsite.  They all started talking to each other in a screechy voice, that entertained us for at least an hour.  I think it was a hunting training session for some young'uns.  They were probably looking for some easy ""prey"" from the campers picnic tables.  Tomorrow we hope to hang out at another wayside amd camp store.

I packed everything up and took it down to the shelter as I didn't want to walk back up that hill again where we had set up.We headed out after 08 again and continued hiking north. The day was a little overcast, but it was still a fine day.We rested by the horse stables around 1000 and saw that if the Skyland Resort was only .6 away and they serve breakfast until 1030. We hurried along and made it there with plenty of time to spare. The hostes put us in a corner, which is understandable as this is one of the classier places in the park, but we have sropped apologizing about our odor. They are used to it I guess. I did pitty the couple that were seated next to us though.They had an AYCE breakfast buffet and we had a great second breakfast. It was awesome. After resting a bit we continued on. We passed the highest point on the trail in the park at Stony Man and then climbed up to Little Stony Man cliffs that had a great view. As we walked along I came to a gap in the rocks and there was a man down there in climbing gear. It was a little surprising to see him down there.Next we took a nice long break at Pinnacles picnic area. There was a large group of summer camp kids going out for a three day trip and I was relieved when they said they were headed south. I hope they have fun.We took a short break at Byrds Nest #3 Hut and then went on to Marys Rock which had another great view. We could see where we had to go next which was quite a ways down and could imagine where the shelter was up on the next mountain.On the way there I was out in front for a while. LoGear caught up to me and told me I walked right past a bear that was about 20 feet off the trail sitting on a rock. She got pics so it did happen.On the final descwnt to the highway crossing she said she came upon a snake that had its head in a hole and was squirming around. We found out later it was hunting a frog.We rested one more time at the parking lot that had a very nice restroom. We cleaned up a bit and got water for the last mile to the shelter. We talked to a couple that we had passed going down, who told us about the frog.The trail was very rocky today and our feet were hurting as a result. The trail was painful today, but the trail is the trail.We did call the nearby hostel to see if they had room, but they were booked solid. It would have been nice to get another shower, but showers are overrated and we have embraced our Adventure Stench.One more mile and we were in camp. We saw another deer right in the trail on the way and when we were setting up our hammocks an eight point buck lingered near us the whole time we were setting up.We made dinner as darkness fell and talked with a couple of hikers, G and Runaway, then came back to our hammock for the night.The next two days are less miles each day, so the finish of this push should be pretty easy.Flora: Black CohoshFauna: Deer, bear (LoGear), snake (LoGear)VOD: Little Stony Man and Mary's RockSmell: MugglesSound: Blue JayHigh: The awesome breakfastLow: My hurting feet at the end of the day from the rocky trailHope: For a good day of hiking and another awesome Wayside visit.","Rock Spring Hut

It was very peaceful. We headed out at 08. Our first important goal was the wayside for lunch, but first we needed to walk around 7 miles. We took a break a few miles in and soon we were ordering chicken and hot dogs and drinking 24 oz Yuenglings. Finishing with some Signature Blackberry Ice Cream and one more Bud for the road (trail).We relaxed and charged our devices and I even enjoyed a presentation about bears by a ranger.But eventually we had to pull free of the whirlpool of the Wayside and start walking the last 5 miles. Chipmunk arrived just as we were getting ready and tried to pull us back in, but we escaped.I unlocked my drunk bushwhacking ability by stupidly thinking I could take a fire road for a short distance as it looked like it intersected the trail in the woods. Well, it didn't so I had to bushwhack up the hill to find the trail. I had a nice bloody arm from a blackberry bush to initiate me into the ability.

Some needed to get to the Post Office, some just wanted to resupply and head back to the trail for a HERO stop. We were still first out and no one passed us during the day, so I hope they all made their goals for the day. We had said our so-longs when we left the shelter. It would be cool to see these guys again up the trail. They were all pretty cool to hang out with. Your Vibe truly does attract your Tribe. Also, the fact that we were all walking about the same distance each day.The day started warm and proceeded to hot. As we descended in elevation, the humidity seemed to increase and the air felt heavier. Luckily our packs were as empty as they were going to be, with nothing but today's food left in our food bags. We stopped for lunch in one of the many parking lots along the Drive and after a nice forest road walk, we steeply descended into Tom Floyd Shelter. We decided to take our last break of the hike and saw two hikers hanging out in the shelter with their packs exploded. We met Wanna b and his son Flashback. They were just starting a southbound traverse of the Park and had realized on yesterday's hike that their packs had too much shit in them. They had decided to take a zero at the shelter and do a pack shakedown. LoGear gave them a bunch of pointers and we has some nice conversation. Telling them about the magical Waysides and all the good trail info that we now knew and they were headed for. As we got up to go, I offered to hump out his extra gear. From our conversation, I thought it was just extra food and some cooking utensils. Wanna b, enthusiastically agreed to let us take the bag, which was quite heavy (later weighed at 7 lbs). I asked several times if it was ok that he never see that stuff again. I planned to take the 1 lb of Starbucks coffee as payment for the haul and hiker box the other stuff somewhere. He was sure that it was a beneficial boon for the both of us. We took the bag, packed it away, said our goodbyes and headed out. On the way down the trail, LoGear said we should have gotten his address to send the stuff to, as we were sure we didn't need it and he may want it for camping down the road. I had been thinking the same thing and we discussed a few fanciful ideas on how we could still possibly get his info using the Trail Grapevine.We finished our hike and arrived back at the truck. I took my phone out of airplane mode and saw I had a messenger request from someone named Rob. I ok'ed it and saw that it was a photo of Wanna b's contact info. I was floored. It seems he had put a rented satellite hot spot in the bag and forgotten that it was in there until after we had left. I made contact with Wanna b ensuring him I could send him his stuff back and he messaged me his address. The Trail really works in the most perfect way.We headed to Front Royal, ate some Pizza Hut Express and drove the 2.5 hours back home. Phase II-a of Pamola's Quest is in the books.

Log: After another 16 zeros filled with car travel, beach, family visits, a lake and a concert, I headed back to the trail, skipping another 2.5 Pushes of miles I have hiked in the past. This would be Push 17b, The Push to Delaware Water Gap. 
We got home from the concert after midnight and I had my usual prehike restlessness. I was up around 0630 and we were on the road at 0745. We arrived at Lehigh Gap where I had completed a section a couple of years ago.
I said goodbye to LoGear and headed up the trail.  I had just started up and was reading a interpretive sign when I saw two hikers.  They recognized me. It was Scrambles and Grouch who we last seen around the Smokys. It was cool as we caught up while we picked our way up the rock face. The climb out of Lehigh Gap is fun and challenging. I had to stow my poles for the ascent.
I moved ahead of them near the summit and didn't see them the rest of the day.
Once we were up the trail was pretty good. Not too rocky at first.  As soon as I mentioned that, it started to get more rocky. It is an anoying kind of rocky that is a lot of sharp, small rocks piled on the trail with a little dirt mixed in. That's just the way the land is here.
As I walked along, I would stop at the views of Palmerton and I guess the old zinc plant that killed all the nearby hillsides.  This side had received some reclaiming work and had some good young trees growing. Across the valley, those hillsides still looked pretty dead.
I would also stop for the wine berries that still had a few ripe berries left. I met Bonnie along the way. She is out for a few days solo.  
When I was heading for a lunch spot, I was passed by a guy that I recognized from Push 14 in Shenandoah.  He was also at the lunch spot and we ate together.
I learned his name is Lazy Boy because he carries a chair to sit in when he takes a break.
After lunch I saw Bonnie again and let her use my nail clippers on one of her toes.
I made my way to a campsite where I decided to take a long break and consider stopping early for the day or trying to get the whole 15.7 done.
I set up my hammock and took off my shoes. After resting for awhile, I decided to eat dinner then try for the shelter. I fugured that I could always just stop along the way if I got tired, but I was able to make the last six miles at a good pace.
When I got in, I was rather low on water, but the source here is flowing very good.
At the shelter were Bonnie and Tortoise. There is another guy whose name I haven't asked yet. After I set up and got my water, there was another hiker who had come in and was cooking dinner.
She looked familiar, but it was getting dark and I didn't have my glasses on. Tortoise was asking her about her hike and other stuff and when she said she had started in late April, I knew I knew her.  I asked her her name and she said Camp. She is part of the duo from Canada of Dragin and Camp.  We had last seen them in the Smokys too. It was so cool seeing Tramily from our earlier hike. She didn't recognize me at first, and had remembered me as Half-Crocked.
We caught up some as darkness deepend and I eventually said goodnight and headed to my hammock.
I feel ok after a decent length day over some rocky terrain. My body feels fine and my feet only hurt the normal amount.
Tomorrow will be another 13 something. 
I didn't put my tarp up after confirming there is no rain heading out way. Fingers crossed.

Log:
I was up at 06. My sleep had been hindered by an off and on headache. Maybe from dehydration. 
I left before 08 with three liters for the day. Water sources would be iffy again today.
The first challenge of the day was Wind Gap. The going down wasn't too bad, but the uphill was a bitch. It was the only real climb of the day, so I just kept at as the sweat poured off my body until it was done.
At the parking lot in the Gap there was a large group of kids heading out with packs. I asked where they were going, but didn't hear any answer.  I figured I better make it to the shelter before them so I could get a spot, but when they came they moved ahead .1 and set up away from the shelter.
The trail was its usual PA rocky most of the day, with a few spots of good trail. It can be painful after a while stepping on all those sharp rocks.
After checking a stagnant pool for a water source and rejecting it, I moved on to Wolf Rocks.  It is a nice scramble with a decent view.  After awhile it became rather tiring, but the only way was forward.
Late in the day I saw a hiker ahead looking into the woods. There was a rattle snake just slowly going about his business next to the trail. I watched him for a few minutes as he moved about. He never rattled.
There was some pretty nice trail at the end of the day and before too long I was pulling into the shelter as I drank my last swallow of the three liters.
The water here is from a tap, so that is cool.  I set up above the shelter next to another hiker named Ashes.  He has been hiking for about two years straight. Just going from one trail to another. Basically living out here.  We had some good conversation.
There are other hikers down at the shelter that came in later in the day and Bonnie and Tortoise is down there too.
Tomorrow I plan to head onto Delaware Water Gap to resupply and hopefully shower. I may stay the night, or get everything done and head out to a campsite 5.3 into New Jersey.  We will see how it goes.

Log:
I was up during the night as happens a lot out here. I rolled out at 0620 and was Oscar Mike at 0730. I wanted an early start as today was town day and I had things to do and town food to eat.
I moved along pretty fast and passed Coach Sunshine (Bonnie) fairly quickly. Todays track was very nice, with lots if forest road and not too many ricky areas.
I could hear I 81 as I moved along as I started to descend into the Gap.
I stopped at Lenape pond for a break and finished off my salami and cheese.  I cintinued along and soon I was turning into town. There is the Church if the Mountain Hiker Center within the first block and that was my first stop. 
This donation bases hostel had all I needed for now.  I started charging my electronics and took a shower, doing a little cowboy laundry. A few other hikers came in and we had some good conversation. Lakes had read my The Trek article about pack lists from the past and remembered me. So at least one person read my article :)
I headed down into town around Noon. I stopped at the Sesame Grille for a nice burger and a couple of brews, then headed to one of the gas station convenience stores which is the best of the slim pickens fir resupply and got a few things. I'm going to try and eat a couple meals along the way on this Push as I know we pass a few stores and delis.
I hung out for awhile and then got everything together and headed out. It was time to leave PA and start NJ.DWG finished Push 17b. This end/beginning would be a Hero Day. You have your Zeros and your Nearos. A Hero is when you come into town, do all your chores and then head out of town all in one day. Push 18 begins.
I crossed the river and entered the next state.  A light rain started to fall, so I stopped in the visitor center to check it out and then moved on. The rain had stopped.
As I started the climb up the ridge another hiker joined me.  Sweet Boy was out for a day hike and we had a good talk. He asked me that if I could have anything I wanted, what would it be?  I thought about different food items and then answered a beer. He immediately took off his pack and pulled out a Lager and offered it to me. I happily accepted it and thanked him thrice.
I continued up the awesome trail passing a group of Outward Bound hikers along the way and arrived at the campsite just after 1700. 
This camp is huge with plenty of great sites. I found Coach and Tortoise and set up nearby.  I took the beer down to dinner and shared it with Tortoise.
The evening is very pleasant and I have good signal here.
Tomorrow may be another easy day or I may add some mileage if I feel good. Rain is in the forecast, so that may affect some of the day's decisions.
I'm really enjoying being an Outsider once again.

 Log:
I was up in the middle of the night again, but it was positive. I felt rested and my mind had lots of thinking to do. I read, wrote some notes, planned the next day's hike.  I was feeling good.
I finally fell asleep for awhile and I rolled out at 0620 again.  I packed up and headed down to have coffee with Coach Sunny and Tortoise. 
Coach and I headed out together, but she fell behind at Sunfish Pond and I didn't see her again. Today was her last day on the trail.
I headed to the Mohican Outdoor Center for some lunch. I wrote a farewell note to Coach and walked to the Center. I ordered a sandwich and charged my phone. They only had rye bread, but it tasted delicious.
I hung out for awhile and got ready to leave when a group of summer camp hikers came in. We talked a bit and I packed up and headed out.
The first target was a campsite at 11.4 miles, but I was pretty sure I would want to move on from there to another campsite at 15.6.  That turned out to be the case. 
At around 1500 the temp dropped several degrees, the wind picked up and the slow roll of thunder, rumbled in the distance. Soon the storm arrived and I continued on. I had been saying that a little rain would be a relief in the constant heat and it was, at first.
The rain got heavier and heavier and I went from sweaty wet to downpour drenched in about 10 minutes. I continued on. Stepping through the puddles and flowing stream that the trail had become was actually refreshing.
When I came to Crater Lake, I decided to take the trail into the picnic area parking lot. I was hoping for a pavilion or restroom to hole up in to wring my clothes out.
There was only a small pit toilet restroom, but in true Hiker Trash fashion, I made myself at home. I traded my wet shirt for my rain jacket and decided to make dinner in the shelter of the building. I propped the door open with my trekking pole and cooked my dinner in the doorway.
By the time I was done, the rain had stopped and the sun was trying to come out. I packed up and headed out. Continuing along the lake then up another trail back to the AT. This is the section I had hiked two years ago, so I wasn't skipping any un-hiked trail on this weather bypass.
I arrived at the campsite and started setting up as the mosquitos started to find me.  I got everything set up in record time, got out of my wet clothes and jumped into the hammock.
Tomorrow I hope to spend some time in Culvers Gap, eating more town food and maybe enjoying a beer.

I was awake early and started doing my morning chores in the hammock as the mosquitos were waiting for me. Breakdown time is much faster when the bugs are biting.
I was out before 07 and on my way.  I stopped at Brinks Shelter for some water, a snack and to use the privy.
The next stop was in Culvers Gap.  I stopped at the closed deli where we had eaten two years ago and took off my still wet shoes and put on my crocks and my camp shirt.
I ordered lunch and something to go for dinner. I also had a few pints of Lager. I just relaxed and enjoyed the view of the lake. There were some nice bluegill hanging out by the dock.
I finally pulled myself away and headed up out of the Gap. I stopped at the Sunrise Mtn pavilion and ate my dinner then continued on.
I arrived at the shelter and set up. I talked with a Sobo, Coo coo for a bit then headed to the hammock.  There is a large group of kids here. Very talky.
I'm not sure what I will do tomorrow. I guess I'll figure it out as I go.

I was up and moving early today. Headed to the privy before the kids woke up.
I packed up, ate at the table then headed out. Within 30 minutes I heard a noise and saw a yearling bear working at a rotten log. He was so intent that he didn't see or hear me. I took a pic and video and then he must have smelt me and he moved away.
My first stop was at High Point State Park HQ. I got a free soda and filled my water. Next I headed to Marcia Lake for a swim. I turned the wrong way when I hit the road and ended up walking all the way around the lake. I should have followed the sound of the swimmers voices. 
When I finally got to the lake, I took everything out of my pockets and went into the lake.  It was very refreshing.
Next I went up to the concession stand and ordered a second lunch. The lady let me charge my phone in her stand. She was very nice.
I headed out in anticipation of the rocks getting better and the track was very good off and on as I made my way to Unionville.
I stopped at the secret shelter for water and met the owner of the place.  Supposedly, the shelter had closed as of June 1, but when I asked him about that, he just said that he has had hikers in almost every night.
I made my way to the road crossing and then walked the .75 into town.  I first found a place for my hammock and then went to the General Store to register to stay in the park for the night and to get a few resupply items.
Next I went to the Pizza place and ordered a medium for myself. It was delish.
I haeded back to the park and settled everything, then went down to the Tavern where the other hikers had gone to.
The Katydids are singing and I'm not sure how tomorrow will go, but I know it will work out.

I was up early. It had rained during the night (the only thing that silences those Katydids), but was all done by 0630. I packed up and moved to the gazebo to make my coffee and eat breakfast.
I had decided to bypass Vernon, NJ and do 16.8 to Wawayanda shelter, so I needed to resupply at the general store before heading out. That task finished, I headed out.
The first five miles were super fast track and I got it done in two hours. The trail was mostly flat and ran through a marsh wildlife refuge.  The next two hours I would only do 2.5 miles as the trail climbed two rocky hills.
I broke for lunch at a road crossing, sitting on the steps that exited the road. Next I made my way to NJ 94 where the farm store was.  I had some ice cream, chocolate milk and a donut. All very good.
I met the Ridge Runner, Padfoot, who gave me some cherries. She is here at the shelter tonight.
You have to climb a pretty high mountain here. They call it the stairway to heaven as there are a lot of rock steps. It being a Saturday, muggles were everywhere.
I met Scrambles and Grouch as I started up and stayed with them until the spring, where they stopped for water.
I made it up and continued on.  My feet were grumbling a lot, so I rested a few times to massage the dogs.
There were a couple of trail magic coolers today. Mostly water, but at one there were sodas. The root beer hit the spot.
I got into the shelter and set up. Padfoot came in and I cooked my dinner at the table, but had to reture to my hammock to eat as the mosquitos were eating me.
When I was at the farm, I called the motel in Warwick and asked about a room for tomorrrow.  It is time to do a short day and rest the feet, do laundry and take a good shower.

Log:
The original plan for today was going to be a short walk to the next road in .5, then road walk/hitch about 4 miles to the Motel, but in the gray light of morning, I checked the map in Awols and it looked like a better plan would be to finish NJ and do 10.1 to the road on the other side of town.  So I rolled out and started packing up.
My feet were ok in the AM, but I could see two deep blisters on both balls of my feet. I taped up and went back to double socks to provide as much cushion as possible.
I headed out before 08 and felt pretty good.  I passed the two bail out roads quickly and with confidence. I continued on to the border and finished my 7th state. 
New York welcomed me with several long rocky ridgetop walks with several scrambles up and down. It was cool, but seemes to go on just a little longer than I wanted it to. At one point I did something that bent my pole a bit, but I was able to bend it back almost straight.
Two different day hikers told me about a must visit creamery at the next road, which would be my stopping point for the day, so I figured I would check it out.
Another guy heading in my direction stuck with me for awhile and we had some good conversation until he reached his turnaround point at the view.
The trail finally came off the rocks and I passed several day hikers coming up. I got to the road crossing and took a break while I studied my guide and app.
I walked down to the Creamery, which was mobbed. I saw a couple hikers and went over to say hi. One was Woodpecker who we had met for about 5 seconds in the Smokys and she remembered me. We caught up for another 5 seconds and then she moved on.
The line for ice cream was longer than I wanted to wait and I really didn't want to inflict my stench on the muggles so I didn't bother. I was actually hungry for a real lunch since I hadn't eaten yet. I was hoping to hit the hot dog stand,  but it was closed.
I fired up my Uber app and saw a driver 8 minutes away, so I pushed the button. He arrived quickly and swept me into the town of Warwick and the Warwick Motel.
The Motel was a small thing with evidence of recent renovations. No one was around, so I called the number on the front desk sign and left a voice mail.  I helped myself to a soda in the fridge and plugged in my electronics. I settled into the comfortable sofas and waited as it was still early in the day.
Harry the proprietor showed up soon and checked me in.  I got the hiker rate with a 10% veteran discount thrown in. He gave me a nice toasted bagel.
The room cleaners were nowhere to be found, but Harry gave me my key so I could go shower and get my stuff in the room. I still needed some lunch.
You could tell the room was still in the process of being turned over, but I didn't  care. I showered and unpacked, changing into my somewhat cleaner camp clothes. 
There was a deli about a quarter mile away and I headed there to see what they had. I grabbed some beer and a few resupply items and ordered a chicken parm hero (as they are called here) and headed back to the room.
The cleaner finally came in and took the sioled linens that were sitting there, but that was it.  I was happy in my little room and had all I needed.
I went to the laundry and washed everything except my camp shorts, which I had only worn a couple times. The laundry was free and he even provided the soap.  
I got caught up on my DVRed TV shows and had a relaxing night.  I stayed up to watch Game of Thrones then hit the hay.
Tomorrow is supposed to be full of heavy rain, so a zero seemed like a good idea.  I need to give my feet a break from the pounding. 
I plan on being pretty lazy tomorrow with maybe a walk into the area with lots of shops. I still need to resupply my stove fuel. It still has some gas, but won't last much longer.

I was up pretty early, ready to get back on the trail. I took one more shower and packed up. 
I went down to the lobby and the door was locked. I rung the bell and Harry came and let me in. We started the coffee and got my bagel toasting.  Harry told me a bus comes at 0655 and the stop was right on the corner.  I ate up and drank my coffee, caught the bus and was on the trail a little after 07.
My feet felt better after the rest and also still felt pretty good at the end of the day. I had taped up and double socked and all went well.
The trail was pretty good to start and I made good time. I was on track for another 10 by 12, but the continuious climbing slowed me down some.  
As I passed Wildcat shelter three hikers were coming out.  I stayed ahead of them until the falls. At this point I started following a well used trail that I thought was the AT.  It wasn't. I had missed the turn by the falls that climbed up using lots of stone stairs.  I quickly noticed my mistake and backtracked. The guys were taking a break and I headed up and away.
I seemed to walk off the trail several times today. There are so many other trails here, that, if you aren't paying attention, you will find yourself off trail.
There was a lot of water magic at several of the road crossings. I kept filling my bottle, ensuring my pack stayed heavy with water. I stopped for lunch at one place that had a few chairs and a bug candle.
When I was almost at the lemon squeezer I passed a group of hikers.  They asked me if I wanted some almonds. Of course I said yes.  They kept giving me stuff. In addition to the nuts, they gave me chocolate, gatorade, a strawberry and a banana.  Yum.
I met Buckle and Lucky Star at the squeezer which was a challenge to get up. I had to take my pack off and I helped Buckle get hers up.
I entered into my final push of the day mode and arrived at the shelter at 1635.
I found a spot and a tree to hang my food and set up.  There is supposed to be a bear hanging out here taking food. 
Firefly and another hiker came in and soon others. Buckle and Lucky Star and of the others I have only met Pearl before. 
The biters are out,  so I'm in my hammock. It's time to zip myself in.
I'm not sure how far I'm going tomorrow. We shall see.

I headed out at 0620 and was at the lake before 07. I made some coffee and charged my phone. When I went to check my phone, I didn't pay enough attention to where I set my cup and spilled all of my coffee. 
I got back on the trail and headed to the next shelter for a break. Time seemed to be going slow today for some reason. The trail was only moderatly hard, but I seemed to be dragging. It felt like the day two blues. Loneliness was creeping in.
As I was finishing my break at the shelter, two guys from the last shelter came in. We talked a bit and when I mentioned my concern about finding fuel, he stated our favorite motto out here. The Trail will provide. 
Of course I lost the trail again leaving the shelter. I saw some faded blazes that must have been blue at one time, but looked white to me that led to a water source. The real trail climbed straight up the huge pile of rocks behind the shelter of course.
The next challenge of the day would be West Mtn. This was the place that had kicked LoGear's and my ass two years ago. It would kick mine once again today.
I got turned around once again up at the top somehow and luckily I quickly saw a couple I had just passed and verified that I was an idiot before turning around and continuing on in the right direction.
After West Mtn was Bear Mtn. I was really low on water and in a foul mood, so I decided to take the old road shortcut that bypassed the Mtn top. We had already hiked that part, so I didn't  give a shit about skipping it.  
It was still a long way down to the park and some water, but I persevered  and was drinking water out of a fountain before too long.
The picnic area was rather crowded for a Wednesday but no one offered me any of their delicious smelling food.  I decided to buy a hotdog, but they were out, so I opted for an expensive hamburger.
I sat for awhile trying to decide what to do. I was feeling down and exhausted and didn't really feel like climbing another mountain to a campsite listed in the book, so I decided to try one of the motels in Fort Montgomery. 
I walked through the zoo and came out by the bridge. I saw two women hikers sitting in the shade and asked them if they were waiting for a ride.  They said yes and it was from the same motel I was thinking of going to.  I made a quick call to confirm they had a room and was able to catch the same ride with the woman. Mud Face and Fuss Bus were their names.
They were finishing up a 30 day hike going south.  When I asked Kurt, the driver (and proprietor) if he knew where I could find some fuel, Fuss Bus said she would give me their leftovers.  The Trail provides. 
We checked in and I took a nice shower then went across the street to the BBQ place for dinner. The girls were there and I sat with them. They were very nice and it was nice to hear their stories of the trail north of here.
I went back to the room and relaxed. Texting with LoGear and watching TV.
Later I saw the girls out on the porch enjoying their wine and sat and talked with them until the bugs started biting.
For the next couple of days, I am going to take it real easy. The Greymore Center is near and I want to check that out, so tomorrow may be a nearo with free camping.   The next day may be a park that lets you stay one night free. Hopefully I can pull myself out of my funk.

I was in no hurry and would be able to get a ride back to the trail up to 09.
At around 0830 I was ready to go and Kurt took me back to the bridge. I headed out, crossing the bridge and heading back up the next mountain.  
I was happy to take my time and was happy I had saved this climb for when I was rested and refreshed. I probably  could have made it there last night, but was glad that I hadn't made yesterday harder than it had already been. 
I made it all the way to Route 9, where a Deli sat perched between two roads.  I hurried over and dropped my pack at the tables where three hikers sat. 
I ordered a cheese steak and grabbed a couple beers for lunch. Outside I hung out with Firefly, Swamp Donkey and Sleeping Beauty who I had last seen down in Damascus before I got off trail the first time.  She had done a flip flop and was going to be done in a day or so at Greenwood Lake.
We hung out for over an hour before hiking the last .5 to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center. They let you camp at the ball field. There is electricity, a pavilion, porta potties and a cold shower.  All we need or want. 
Since we arrived at 1335, the rest of the day was pretty lazy. There was a hiker here, Pumpkin, who had a stress fracture in her foot and had been here for a week. She had decided to go home as it didn't seem to be getting any better.  I carried her pack up the road for her where she was waiting for her ride. 
I made dinner of something I took from the hiker box. It was home dehydrated mushrooms, ham and mashed potatoes. I added some stuff and some spoonfuls of a dried veggie medley that Firefly gave me.  It was good, but I should have used a little more water.
Tomorrow I head to the State Park where you can stay one night for free.

I was up early and quietly pittered about to get my gear together and do breakfast.
I headed out at 0700. I bit of a climb had me wet with sweat quickly. Today was just one of those days where you have just keep putting one foot in front of the other to get it done.
I seemed to be low on energy today. Some of the climbs were steep, but they all seemed to kick my ass a little.
After lunch at a road that had a water spicket to use, I saw a hiker walk by in the distance, as I sat resting, but couldn't tell who it was. When I started on, I came to a stream where the hiker was resting. It was Red Bull. I keep seeing him on this Quest. He said he had gotten off trail for awhile and had just come back.
I pushed on and after what felt like a very long time, I was at the beach of the lake at the park. It was a bit of a walk to the concession stand for a quick bite, drink and ice cream. After that it was another long walk to the campground, where we can stay free for one night.  
I found the sites, but there wasn't much pickens for hammocks, but I managed to find an acceptable space and set up. 
I took a little walk around the camp. There is a guy here who likes to feed hikers and talk to them at Site 16. He came down and I went up and he made me a sandwich. He was really cool. His name is Joe. He is a Viet Nam Vet and likes to tell his stories and hear yours.

The first five miles went fast and I was pulling into the RPH shelter a little after 09. I had been thinking that it would be nice if there was some leftover pizza, but didn't think it would happen. As soon as I walked into the shelter, I was offered a slice.  Awesome. 
I headed to the next stop, a deli that was .4 off trail, but hiker friendly. Getting there was a little harder than the first five miles, but before too long I was pulling off my pack and going inside.  I just got some chips and a beer to start. 
We hung out behind the store where they had a picnic table and an outlet for charging. At some time after two, I headed the last 3.8 or so to the shelter.
Firefly had gotten there before me and another couple were setting up nearby. 
Dragin, Camp and three other hikers came in for water and we had some good conversation until they headed out for the next shelter. Boston came in and also 10 steps, who just got back on trail.

I was up before 06 and did the normal routine and headed out after 07. The trail was pretty nice today. Lots of good grades and some pasture walking. 
I took my first break at Nuclear lake.  It is very pretty. Next I went for another 10 by 12 and just made it.  I pulled into a garden center for lunch. They are real hiker friendly and let you hang out, charge your phone and even have a cold shower out back to refresh yourself. I bought a Klondike and a soda.
That family that is hiking with the one year old baby came in. They flipped awhile ago. It was cool to meet them. 
I moved onto what I had planned to be my final push to the shelter at 16.6, but Firefly caught me just before the shelter and inspired me to do four more to the next shelter to make tomorrow's hike shorter before the town stop. 
I had stopped to dig out my bug net, which I had been carrying for hundreds of miles.  It was time to see how it worked as the gnats had become very bothersome. 
I stopped at the first shelter and made dinner while Firefly hung out.  Afterwards, I watered up and we headed the last 4 miles to the next shelter. 
I made good time for the last miles and pulled in to the shelter. Dragin and Camp are here. The river look so inviting, so I went and took a quick dip after setting up.
Tomorrow, I hope to get to a real grocery store for some resupply. Then to find a good place to eat that maybe isn't a deli.

I was up before 06, but it was cool out and I didn't want to get up after troubled sleep and aching feet. But I was up and heading out before 0730.
The trail followed the rivers for awhile and then headed up Shaghticoke Mtn. I had put my bugnet on and was flipping it up every so often to drink and somehow I must have knocked my hat off without realizing it. After I did realize, I put my pack down and went back down hill about .1 to try and find it.  I didn't want to climb that mountain again, so I want on.
Not long after Dragin and Camp caught me. I asked if they had seen my hat. They said the had, but weren't sure it was mine. What the fuck? They have seen me wearing that hat since NC. I'm a little pissed at them for robbimg me of that best thing that can happen on the trail, reuniting a hiker with lost gear.  I have carried stuff for several miles when I find it on the trail. Sometimes even if I don't know whose it is. Oh well, shit happens. I'm bummed to have lost it, but I just need to let it go.
After dragging myself over two more steep hills, I came to the road to Kent.  Firefly arrived shortly after and we headed into town. Somehow I lost my buff in the short time we were sitting there. Today was becoming a real shit day.
We stopped at a outfitter/ice cream store and I bought a new very expensive hat, a tent stake (one had broke) and some ice cream. 
Next we went over to the pizza place and ate lunch. After that we stopped at the small welcome center where you can use the rest room, take a shower for $2 and charge your electronics.
We left our packs and went to the IGA for resupply. We hung out at the welcome center for a while, sorting our food and drinking a couples brews.
A hiker stopped by as I was getting ready to leave and showed us a road walk along the river that avoids some of the annoying hills in the afternoon's walk. Since I was tired from lack of sleep and the morning's hike and was having such a bad day losing all my gear, I opted for the river walk.  It falls under EarthTone's Appalachian Trail Inclusion Corridor  which extends 1 mile to either side of the Trail. It was a very pleasant walk.
I arrived in camp before 1900 and set up. I was pretty tired and had eaten my leftover pizza on the walk in, so I hit the hammock as soon as all the other chores were done.
Tomorrow will be a short day where I will be picked up and taken to Hudson's Bearded Woods Hostel.

I wasn't in a hurry to get going, but when I'm ready, I'm ready. So, I was on the trail at 0730 and moving leisurely along the flat riverside trail.
Eventually it started to climb and I had to climb three or four hills, some with rocks of course. I didn't mind too much as this was going to be a short day.
I took my first break at a road and while I was sitting there Hudson pulled up to drop off some sobos. I talked to him a bit and said I would see him in a couple of hours as I had two more mountains to climb. 
I texted him when I was 2 miles out and hit the road at exactly 1200. Hudson pulled up a few minutes later and soon I was washing the trail off me, gathering my nasty clothes that hadn't been in a washer since Warwick, NY and relaxing an the couch. They have loaner clothes, but most of them were sized medium. I may have lost weight, but I'll never be a medium again.
They have a scale on the porch and I weighed in at 205.  15 less than when I started this Phase and 35 less than when I started the Quest.
I pretty much just took it easy the rest of the day, eating ice cream and chips and Hudson made me a salmon salad sandwich which was delicious. 
Hudson offers a free slack pack if you stay a second night, so I thought I would try it out.  He will drop me at the road tomorrow with a small pack of just the days essentials and pick me up in Salisbury after about 17 miles. I'm looking forward to some light hiking tomorrow.
The day's slack packers came in later in the day and we caught up. One is Babbit who had been hiking with Firefly for awhile before I came along.
They said the trail is real nice tomorrow. I hope it's true.

Sleeping on a mattress is just not the same as the hammock. It is comfortable enough, but my arms get numb. I woke early and went out into the common room to watch the rest of GOT with less load on the wifi.
I was up before 06 and drinking coffee on the porch. Breakfast was great and filling.
He all headed out after all the bills were settled with those leaving today. I got to my part of the trail at 0824 and headed up the hill with a very light load.
This was my first time slack packing during the Quest and it felt great. I moved along at a decent pace, feeling like I had nothing on my back. All I carried was the days necessities and a couple contingencies.
I made decent time for the first 5 miles, not needing any lenghtly breaks other than taking drinks when needed.
I had brought leftover pizza for lunch and I ate the three pieces spaced out over time.  I took a longer break around 1230 to eat the last piece and rest my feet near the hydro electric plant.
I broke out the tunes and just blazed the rest of the miles. After the last major climb, I just flew along, enjoying my music.
Before I realized it I was at the last road of the day.  I did the short road walk and then moved off trail to follow the Rambler rail trail into town. 
I texted Hudson when I arrived at the store and then did some quick shopping for a couple breakfast items and some drinks.
Hudson came by about 30 minutes later and we were transported back to the Hostel. Kitchen Sink was already on board and we talked on the ride back.
Dinner was steak and corn on the cob and was delicious. 
Tomorrow it is back to regular hiking with the full pack. I enjoyed the slack pack, but now we move on. 
Bearded Woods is an awesome Hostel. I can't say enough good things about it.

Time stop and miles: 1608/13.17. End point: Glen Brook shelter Log:I have noticed that when it comes time to leave a Hostel, I get both antsy and reluctant. It seems that I really enjoy being that plugged into the Matrix at these places. But I know that I have trail to walk, so I also want to get going.So as Big Lu dropped me off just outside Salisbury where I had left the trail yesterday, I was a little bit car sick and a whole lot home sick. I started slowly, wearing my rain jacket to keep warm until I got the sweat flowing. I soon shook off the unhappy feelings and started to enjoy the morning. I made pretty good time up past Lions Head and two close together shelters. I soon passed Kitchen Sink who was heading sobo today. Descending Bear Mtn was a bear, as it was steep and rocky for quite awhile. It was slow going for a long while and then the grade moved towards level and I started cruising. Just around the border of MA I came to a bunch of roots exposed across the trail. A half second of lapsed concentration and my left foot hit a root off center and tried to turn on me. My natural reaction when this happens is to quickly stab my poles in the ground to shift my weight. I did this, but my momentum kept me moving forward and I started to go down. These things always seem to happen in slow motion, so, as I started falling I opened my hands and fell onto my pole handles. My right knee also took some of the fall. I lay on the ground for a couple of seconds waiting for any pain to tell me if anything was damaged. I seemed ok, so I unbuckled my pack and slipped my hands out of my pole straps. I stood up and assessed the damage. My ankle felt fine. The weight shift had worked. The heels of my hands hurt a little, but there were no abrasions. My right knee didn't fare so well. It had taken the brunt of the fall, but again no abrasions and it wasn't too bad. I continued on, saying to myself that I must have tripped over the border. I would survive.Sages Ravine was pretty cool. There were a couple of real nice water holes that would have been refreshing, but the day wasn't hot enough yet.I stopped for lunch at one of the campsites and after I got going, I caught up to Scrambles and Grouch. I stayed behind them as we climbed and descended a few mountains.Eventually we passed a couple of hikers who I remembered from yesterday. They were Q-Tip and Donkey. They were also with ""Kris"" aka Sinatra the notorious serial killer hiker that has been blowing up the Class of 2017 FB page by the cyber hikers. Or so they want you to believe.I got behind the others as we started climbing the last Mtn, Mt Everett, which totally kicked my ass.Near the shelters, there is a picnic area by a pond and someone left several gallons of water and two coolers with very cold water in them. We all rested here for awhile and then headed on. All the others were heading to Great Barrington, another 8.5 miles, but my day was ending in .5 at the shelter area.I came in a little after 1600 and found a nice spot for the hammock. I had dinner and am ready to get a better night's sleep than I did the last too nights in a bed.Rain is in the forecast for all day tomorrow. I can't wait to see how that goes.Fauna: garter snake, squirrel, chipmunk VOD: Top of Bear MtnSmell: bacon at breakfastSound: My panting breath High: Finding a nice setup spot at the shelter area.Low: Climbing Mt EverettHope: That the rain is manageable tomorrow","US44 - Salisbury, CT - Bearded Woods

I heard the first drops on the tarp at 0500, but it remained light and in the trees while I broke down camp. I was out a little after 07 and heading for a long descent into Great Barrington. It was slow going as it was pretty rocky and everything was wet.The rain picked up for about 30 minutes, so I donned the rain jacket, even though I was already wet. It mainly just keeps me from getting chilled.I took my first pack off break at the Shays Rebellion monument at about 6 miles. There wasn't too many places to stop and rest today. I actually sat at the base of the monument and leaned against it.Next I walked to an antique store on US 7 and bought a coke. I ate a quick lunch in front of the store sitting on the ground and looking like a homeless man. It had started to sprinkle again.I had about 5 miles left and it involved a pretty long climb and I entertained some ideas to go further today and maybe get to Williamstown a day early, but as the rocks and rain had their way with me, I knew I would be done when I hit the shelter.My feet were yelling at me by the time I got to the shelter. They had been wet most of the day and wanted to dry out.I found a spot quickly, set up, got out of my wet clothes and just laid back in the hammock. It started raining again, just as I got everything set up. I didn't care, I was warm, dry and safe for now. It had been a good decision to not continue on.Tomorrow will be a short day of 11 miles.

I got up and had breakfast before breaking down camp today. Thought I'd change it up a little. I chatted with three kids from Boston College who were out for a few days, then hit the trail.I needed water and since today was a short day, I headed down to Beartown State Forest for a longish break. It turned out to be a great decision. After eating a snack, filling my water and walking around a little, I started heading out.I went to ask the guy about a nearby town and whether it had a food place, since I had figured I might be one dinner short. He was over by a camper and they turned out to be 8 Track, who I had met several days ago and his wife, Cathy aka Angel Princess. They ended up making me a second breakfast and giving me lots of food. It was awesome.I headed up the trail fueled and feeling good. I ate lunch near one of the shelters. Lunch was two peaches and a cup of peaches, courtesy of 8 Track and Angel Princess. Yum.The track was pretty good the rest of the day. It was pretty steep coming down that last mountain, but it was not very rocky with several switchbacks.I got behind a couple day hikers who smelt real nice and saw them taking a photo of something. It turned out to be a large owl in a nearby tree. We all got pics and it flew off as we got close.I got to the empty camp and found a spot. I set up and am waiting for dinner time.

I did have to eat lunch early as my hiker hunger has really kicked in.The last few miles were rather pleasant and before I knew it, I could see the pond. I had to walk all around the pond to reach the trail to the cabin. I arrived at the cabin and it said it was open, but the door was locked. I went up the stairs to the bunk room and it was open. I looked around then put my gear in the bunk room.I went down to the lake and took a swim, while rinsing out my clothes. Now I'm just relaxing until the caretaker comes back.I hung out during the day as hikers arrived and the new caretaker showed up. Later I took another swim. I guess I lost my bug net in the pond. I must have forgotten to take it out of my back pocket and it came out and floated away.I was thinking of hanging my hammock up at the camping area, but just went with the bunk.

It was a peaceful, calm morning and a great way to start the day.Before too long, the bunk room was stirring and the smell of coffee and pancakes wafted through the cabin.I had a helping of cakes and a coffee, then hit the trail. Today looked pretty easy elevation profile wise, but you never know how rocky it will be.It turned out to not be too bad and I made pretty good time throughout the day. I stopped for an early lunch at the October Mtn shelter then thought I would hit the Cookie Ladies place for water and maybe a treat of cookies, blueberries and cookies, but no one was home. All I was able to get was some sulfur tasting water and a few blueberries that were in a container on the table.I arrived at the shelter at 1630, set up and relaxed. I went down to get some water. When I headed down the shelter was empty. When I got back it was filled to capacity with a freshman orientation group from Yale. I had some good conversation with the leaders and some of the students until it was time to retire to the hammock. I'm looking forward to hitting Dalton tomorrow.

Time stop and miles: 1850/16.97. End point: Mark Noepel ShelterLog:I was up at my usual time and on the trail a little after 07. I could taste the second breakfast I was hoping to have in town. A quick 2.5 miles later, I was walking down the streets of Dalton, which the trail goes through. I stopped at a Cumberland Farms store for some coffee and chocolate. They had Ice Cubes, a favorite treat from my youth.I headed down Main street drinking my coffee. Mary Jane stuck his head out of a coffee shop to say hi. I continued down to the Dalton Restaurant and had a wonderful 3 egg omelet and charged my electronics some. I was able to reserve a room at the Williamstown Motel for Wednesday night and buy my bus ticket home. It was time for this Phase of the Quest to come to an end.Next, I crossed the street and got a nice hot shower at the Community Center. I was clean underneath, but had to put on my still nasty clothes, but it was all good. The next stop was the Library, where I was able to print my bus ticket. It was so funny. I went to sit down at a computer and the guy next to me moved his seat, monitor and keyboard as far away from me as he could. I guess the shower didn't help with my overall stench much. I definitely earned my Stinky Hiker Badge with that comic reaction. I worked my way back to Angelina's for a sub that would be my lunch and dinner after I picked up a couple of Genny Cream Ales for the walk out. I'm pretty sure those two 24 oz cans and the stuffed sub added about 5 lbs to my pack.I picked up a last few food items for the next day's hike and headed out of town, after a nice three hour stop.There were thunderstorms forecasted for late in the day, so I was hoping I could get into camp and set up before any rain started to fall.As I was climbing the hills between Dalton and Cheshire, I came upon Fairy Baby and Cave Bear who were enjoying their own tallboys so I joined them to lighten my own load. We leapfrogged each other until Cheshire where I left them at the ice cream shop after enjoying a cone myself.Coming out if Cheshire, you start the climb up Mt Greylock. It starts out mild, then got pretty steep fir awhile then a little better for awhile.I arrived at the shelter just before 1900 and it was pretty full. For a second I thought it was going to be tough finding a spot for my hammock, but I quickly found a spot where a guy and his two sons were camped. They were really nice and kept offering me stuff. They had come out for a few days, but the trail and the mountain had proved a overwhelming challenge and they were heading down in the morning.I was set up and had eaten the rest of my sub and drank my other beer as dusk settled on the camp and finally the rain started to fall.It would rain off and on throughout the night, but would be done by morning.Tomorrow, I complete this Phase of the Quest.

It was going to be a cool and windy day.I packed up and said bye to the guys and finished my climb up Mt Greylock.The rain had made the footing extremely slippy and I took a second fall of the trip on a muddy and rocky down hill section. I managed to roll and land on my shoulder with no ill effects, except a muddy shirt and hand.The clouds were skittering across the mountain top as I arrived at the war memorial to war casualties. I climbed up the 90 steps to the top and was treated to a very nice 360 degree view of all the mountains of the area.The descent of the mountain wasn't too bad, with a few steep or rocky parts, but I was feeling good. I had been able to recharge my ipod some with the last of the juice on my battery pack, so I enjoyed some good tunes until it once again ran dry.I finished the hike just after noon, but I wasn't done walking yet. Check in at the Motel wasn't until 1400. I could have called them for a ride, but decided to walk the 1.5 miles as I had only done 9.6 and still felt good. I walked to a pizza place near the Motel and had a meatball grinder, then checked in. First order of business was a shower. Around 1600, I headed into town to get some dinner and drinks. I had been here around 3 years ago for The Gathering and remembered that it was a cool campus with lots of old buildings.I walked another 1.5 miles or so to Spring St where the shops and pubs are and stopped at the Purple Pub for a beer and some fries. Next I picked up a sixer and started back towards the room.

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576156,"I had converted my pack to ""bus mode,"" removing all the outside, hanging stuff and discarding my old crinkly, water bottles.  I also retired the Half-Crocks.  The right one had taken more damage getting snagged on a tree while hiking, ripping off the heel strap on one side.  They served me well, but it was time to let them go and find something new during this next ""off-trail"" time.
I had some breakfast at the Motel, then walked towards the bus station.  My pack was nice and light and the morning was cool.  I saw four other hikers going the same way.  They turned out to be some locals that had been out for a couple days and were heading to the first stop on the bus trip.
I waited at the Hotel for the bus and boarded on time.  There was plenty of space on the bus and I had two seats to myself into New York City. The ride was pretty pleasant.  The day was nice, with some pretty clouds and the windows were big.  I watched as the landscape turned from rural mountains to city streets.  Going through Manhattan was a fun exercise in people watching.  So many strange fauna did I see.
We arrived at the Port Authority at least 30 minutes later than my transfer bus was scheduled to leave, so I headed up to the Greyhound ticket booth and tried to figure out what to do next.  The ticket girl, updated my ticket to a 1700 bus and said I may be able to get on the 1600 bus if it was still there.  I headed down the busy passageways and found Gate 70, confirming it was the place for a bus to Baltimore.  
I headed to the food place to get some quick dinner then got back in line for the bus.  At around 1630 or so, a bus was there and we boarded.  I'm pretty sure it was the 1600 bus, that was also late.  A common occurrence I would imagine in that city.  I got a good window seat with an outlet and settled in to continue to listen to the last book of the Lord of The Rings trilogy on the trip home.
The ride was uneventful as the light ran out of the day and we arrived in Baltimore some time after 2030.  LoGear was waiting in the parking lot for me once more and in 20 minutes I was carrying my pack into the house and leaving it for the next day.  Phase II-b was now complete.
Now, I plan on once again enjoying the Other World activities that I had been missing and just taking it easy for a few days.  No miles to walk, no camping spots to find.  Just relaxing and re-acclimating to this world of existence.  
I'm not sure yet what Phase III will be or when it will take place, but I have 392 miles in VA that need hiking and just under 600 in the last three northern states, that I'm pretty sure will be the last series of Pushes of the Quest.

Day 289 of Pamola's Quest.  The Quest continues, even though I'm not currently hiking.  I'm having fun watching all of the Class of 2018 go through all the preparation, questioning and nervousness that we felt last year at this time.  I can look at it now with a more experienced eye and am much calmer myself with what is ahead of me.  I know what the trail is like and what I'm like when I'm on it.  I'm looking forward to getting back out there to continue this Quest, gathering all the elements of the Talisman of the Storm and delivering it to Paloma on his peak up in Maine.  After getting off trail once again at the top of Massachusetts near the end of August, LoGear and I went back out in Northern VA in September to pick up some more unique miles for her.  It was a short overnighter, with me dropping her off at one end, going to the other end and hiking in to meet her at the shelter.  The next day, we retraced my tracks and headed into Harpers Ferry.In October, I went out alone to just do another overnighter from the PA/MD border up to Tumbling Run shelter.  I just needed a trail fix.  We didn't get out on the trail in November or December as I started planning a little longer hike to do after the turn of the New Year.  The original plan was to yo-yo from PenMar down to Harpers Ferry and returning, completing Maryland twice in the process.  I headed out on Jan 2nd from PenMar, but turned around after hitting the first shelter.  The weather was just a little more dangerous than I wanted to deal with.  The temp was 6 degrees when I headed out and my water immediately started freezing.  After stopping at Raven Rock shelter for lunch, I decided that I would head back and wait a few days.  I built a nice fire, relaxed a bit, then headed back to the truck.  A week or so later, I had to head back to PA for the funeral of my Aunt and decided to try again.  I shortened the hike to start at I-70 in MD and did the down and back up in four days.  It was still pretty cold, but nowhere as bad as the week before.  During this hike I found another piece of the Talisman.  When I returned home I also made another small leather pouch to carry the Talisman items as I gather them. During that hike, I made the plan to try and get out onto the Trail every month this year.  I have already figured out where to do my Feb hike.  There is a 1.5 mile or so stretch of ""trail"" going through Duncannon that I haven't hiked yet.  It is the only piece of PA that I have not yet hiked at least once.  I'm hoping to start in Boiling Springs, hike to and through Duncannon, cross the river and head up to the next shelter.  I will then retrace my steps again and head back to the truck.  Four days is the plan for now.  I may do more, who knows.  I just wanted to put a little update on here as I haven't posted anything on this site since I got off trail.I'm not sure where I will hike in Mar and April, but in May, I'm planning on continuing the Quest in earnest.  Hiking new trail again.  The plan is to get a ride back down to Damascus in May, just before Trail Days starts and heading north immediately, getting a little ahead of the mass exodus that will come out of there after the weekend.  My friend Kangaroo Joe may be coming with me for that first week.  He has some time off and hasn't hiked since we did the Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail together a couple years ago.  After that first part, I will continue on to at least Rockfish Gap.  This will complete VA for me.  It's possible that I will continue north, re-hiking some of what LoGear and I hiked last July, but that plan is still very hazy.After that series of Pushes, I will take a little time off and then find my way back up to Williamstown, MA where I will continue the final Phase of Pamola's Quest.  VT, NH and ME.  If all goes well, I will find myself presenting the Talisman of the Storm to Pamola at Pamola Peak on Katahdin.  The Quest continues...Peace,EarthTone",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Thu",0
EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589747,"Today is Starsday, the 20th of Thrimidge, Day 380 of Pamola's Quest.  This will be the last update before continuing the Quest.  Next week at this time, we will be hiking.  The plans have only changed slightly since my last update.  LoGear will now be joining us for the first week of hiking when we head out of Damascus as the craziness just begins.  We are also starting a day earlier to fit her vacation schedule.  No more six month leave of absences for her anymore.  Kangaroo Joe (KJ) will be meeting us down at the Relax Inn on Wednesday (Earthday), the 16th of May.  We will spend the night at the Inn.  We aren't picky and we will hopefully get a shuttle down to Damascus the next morning.  We will walk through town, seeing the preparations for Trail Days and then head out of town to the first shelter.  The final gear adjustments have been made and our food is bought for the first Push of Phase III of Pamola's Quest. I am chomping at the bit to get back out there and it will be good to have LoGear with me for that first week.  The hard part will be that second week after she has gone home.  It was hard watching all those vloggers head out this year.  I enjoyed following them for the first couple hundred miles, but eventually have stopped watching most of them except a few.  I plan on continuing to update here, when I can, as I head up the trail for this next Phase.  Phase III will consist of Pushes 10 through 13 and will take me to Rockfish Gap.  At that point I will have now hiked all of the trail from Springer to Williamstown, MA.  After some time off trail (not sure how long), I will head up to Williamstown and finish the last three states with Pushes 21 through ?  (I haven't worked them out yet) Maybe 27 or so...If all goes as Pamola allows, I will be on Pamola Peak somewhere in late August with the rebuilt Talisman of the Storm.Wish me luck...Peace,EarthTone and LoGear (and Kangaroo Joe)",,View Entry,"May 10, Thu",0

Rolled out around 0630 and hit the shower. We headed over to The Barn for Breakfast and all had omelets. They were pretty good.
We packed up and waited for Ms Janet to arrive moving the cars closer to rhe office.
Ms J showed up after 10 and we got rolling around 1045 or so. There were 7 of us. We went to a Walmart and picked up 3 more and continued along after another stop at another Walmart, we arrived in Damascus around 1230. We walked through town heading to the trail. 
After a quick stop at the Osprey booth and a visit to the ALDHA tent to say hello to some friends, we were at the end of town and heading up the mountain.
We didn't have far to go, but we had a late start. We took our time and ate lunch at a campsite around 1430 or so.
The biggest challenge of the day was the 2 mile climb to the shelter. There were 19 switchbacks making it easier, but it still kicked our ass.
We rolled into camp at 1825 and found our spots.  There were a few others here and we had some good conversation at dinner.
I noticed that my cap for my filter smelled bad and Amber, a hiker heading to Damascus gave me her extra. I gave her a cosmic brownie in return. A fair trade.
We hung our food, and each retired to our sleeping places.
The forecast all week was saying that it would be raining all day today, but it turned out to be a really nice day. 
After some morning rain, it got sunny and stayed that way until we were in the woods out of town. We had some light rain later on the day and some sprinkles after getting into camp, but that was it. 
It's a pleasant night and we hope for some of the same tomorrow.

I slept pretty well and was comfortable most of the night. I saw KJ up at 0650, so I rolled out.  There was rain off and on all night and it was still sprinkling as we ate bfast and packed up. 
We headed out at 09, not in a hurry. After awhile the rain stopped for a bit and we took a break after 3 miles.
We were heading to a shelter for lunch and the rain picked up for the last mile or so.  We came in around 1230 and there were four hikers just getting ready to head out.
They had a dog that was a little leery of us until we gave him some of our food, then we were besties. 
We relaxed for over an hour. The rain stopped and the sun came out, so our spirits improved.
The last six miles ended with a 3000 foot climb over 3 miles. We headed up feeling good, but after awhile our asses were once again kicked. 
Finally we approached Buzzard rock, the high point and the wind picked up a lot as we walked into a cloud. The wind was crazy as we got to the rocks and crossed over.
About then the rain started up again and was still coming down when we got to camp. We set up our tarps first and prepared dinner under mine. We were all wet and beat. 
After getting some warm food in us and dry clothes on, we all felt better, but were ready to get into our hammocks and wrapped in down. 
It's foggy and the breeze has a chill to it here at 5000 plus feet.
Tomorrow, we plan to hit a general store for some food, resupply and maybe a shower.

It rained off and on all night and moisture invaded everything as we sat in a cloud at the top of the mountain. My quilt was wet, my hammock too. Pretty much everything. I slept pretty good though and was ready to start the day at 06.
At first I just wanted to pack up and go, but I made my usual morning coffee and got all my wet gear packed up.
I decided I could wait for my morning dump at a parking lot nearby that had a pit toilet so I headed out alone to brown blaze the 2.3 miles. 
I made good time and was able to put out some of my gear to dry on the strong breeze and some sun. I hung out over an hour as LoGear and then KJ showed up.
We headed out walking through a beautiful meadow and made our way to the next shelter for lunch.
Our original plan was to Massey Gap around 1400 and get a free shuttle to the General Store. I needed some resupply and we wanted some burgers.
At the break, KJ decided he would just go to the shelter as he had enough food.  LoGear and I moved ahead at a fast clip as we were way behind schedule. 
We moved over a rocky ridge and saw some ponies, just as it started sprinkling again.  We saw some more later and got to pet these ones.
The rain got harder and harder and just after we crossed the highest point, it became a downpour with some lightning and thunder.
Onward we went and the rain finally stopped leaving us soaked through. 
We got down to the parking lot and of course had no signal to call the shuttle. A ranger was able to call for us, but it was going to be an hour. I asked two woman who were leaving if we could have a ride and they were happy to takes us down the mountain.
We got our resupply and a burger and fries. It was very good. They let us dry some of our wet clothes which was awesome, but we had to wait until after 1800 to get a ride back.
We got our ride and walked to the shelter where we found KJ. The shelter itself was full, but we found some good spots for our hammocks.
As dusk settled over camp, it was time to snuggle in my now mostly dry down, with dry clothes on for another night on the trail.

I'm adjusting well to Outsider life. I even saw some stars during the night when I got out to pee. 
We got packed up and were out before 08. There was a guy there who couldn't get his food bag down. He even tried to burn the line with his stove tied to a branch, which almost had it blow up as it flamed up real high. 
We moved along well as the day became beautiful. Sunny with a warm breeze. We saw more ponies and worked our way along a sometimes still very wet trail.
A hiker named Cosmic passed us and I talked to her for awhile as we walked along, but she was fast, so I eventually let her move on as I waited for LoGear and KJ. She was wearing me out.
We stopped for lunch at the first shelter and Fungi, the guy with the food bag problem came rolling in. He had finally got his stuff down by cutting the tree.
He said he was carrying a whole lot of meals that he had found on the trail that someone had dumped. They were Packit Gourmet.  He asked if we would take any of them and we all did. They looked good and turned out to be delicious at dinner. I had the gumbo and LoGear had shepherd's pie. Score!
We only had one longish climb and the trail got real nice for the last several miles of the day. Before too long we were at our turnoff for the campground we were going to for the night. 
We finished our longest day this week at the earliest time so far. My feet are starting to take a beating from the four days of wet walking.
We found a spot and paid our fee, set up then got our first shower since we started. We all did some cowboy laundry in the shower and I was amazed at how much brown water came out of every piece I washed. 
We made dinner, which was delicious and I started a fire just because we could. The site had firewood and it wasn't raining. At least at first. As it got going I felt the first sprinkles of the day. Oh well.
Tomorrow we plan on 15.9 miles.

 Log:
I slept pretty good with Hurricane Creek rushing by not 15 feet away. I rollled out just after 06 and started the day. 
I tried the banana pudding from the meals Fungi gave us and it was pretty good.  I was packed up and ready to go before the others, so I headed out at 08.
KJ was dilly dallying as usual, so I thought of a new trail name for him as I headed up the blue blaze to the trail. Henceforth he shall be called Dilly Dilly.
Not 15 minutes after I got back on the AT I heard a commotion to my right. It was a yearling bear heading up the hill that I had spooked. He went up about 60 yds and stopped stairing at me.
I asked him to wait a sec as I turned on my phone and he said ok and I was able to take a couple of pics. LoGear came up then and got to see him too as he moved across the ridge waiting for us to leave.
We were heading to the next shelter for lunch as some thunder started to roll over us. It started to sprinkle as we got closer and turned into a down pour as we hurried down the trail to the shelter.
We shook off and ate lunch, then talked for awhile until it slowed down and eventually stopped.  Onward we went.
We rested after a couple hours of moving at our usual speed, but LoGear's feet were bothering her. She had developed a couple blisters since we had been walking with wet feet for the last four, now five days. I was wrestling with a couple myself, but my tape job had made them not hurt too much. 
We soldiered on and soon we were close to our destination, pulling 15.9 miles, a new high for this phase. Last year we didn't hike this far (more actually) for 23 days. We definitely adjust to the trail faster now.
I pulled in at 1722 with the others a few minutes behind. There were a lot of people here. Some we had seen before, some new.
There was a nice piney area away from the shelter where we set up. We went over to the table to make dinner and talked with some of the hikers as we ate.
Tomorrow we finish this push and my hiking partners go home. Then I will be on my own again as I finish VA and continue the Quest.

Log:
After sleeping for awhile, I was awake at 0200 thinking about Push 11, so I turned on my headlamp and did some planning.
We all started stirring around 06 and were packing up and eating breakfast. My hiking partners were ready to finish their hike and it put some pep in their step. 
We headed out at our earliest time yet and started our first climbs of the day.  It was a beautiful morning and we made pretty good time, with just a little slow down at one of the steeper climbs.
We ate lunch at Chatfield shelter and continued on. It was mostly down hill from here.  
We came to the old one room schoolhouse and there was some trail magic waiting for us. We talked to the volunteers there as we enjoyed some ice cold sodas and snacks and a few resupply items.  We gave a donation and offered out thanks, then continued on.
The trail was pretty fast now, with some nice meadows, but there were some muddy spots that would surprise you from time to time. 
At one point the mud was on a slope and I slid. As I tried to stop my fall with my pole, I continued to go down and my shoulder took the brunt of the weight.
I moaned, then cursed, then moaned again as the pain shot through my shoulder. I got up and assesed my status as fears of an ended hike went through my mind. At first I couldn't move my arm at all, but I contunued on and the intensity of the pain subsided some. After awhile I could move my arm, but lifting weight still doesn't work.
I got down to the cars where LoGear was already waiting and tested whether or not I could remove and put on my pack. I can, but it hurts.
As I told a hiker that passed me as I walked on, I can still hike with one arm, so I am continuing on of course. 
We threw everything into the vehicles and headed to Marion and checked into the Econo Lodge for the night. LoGear rested for a bit, took me over to Walmart so I could get a new shirt and retire the stench monster I had been wearing and then headed home to her girls.
I was able to fully resupply with stuff I had brought and from LoGear's foodbag, so I will have a heavy pack climbing out of here.
We went and did laundry and got pizza and wings and relaxed in the room as I reconnected to the Matrix, updated this journal and deleted about 100 emails.
I will see how my shoulder goes during this next push and hope it heals up. Only time will tell.
So tomorrow starts Push 11. The Push to Pearisburg. 90.3 with seven days planned for now.  Wish me luck. The Quest continues.

My shoulder kept me up some overnight, but I was fresh enough when I rolled out of the hotel bed after 06.
I got another shower and we went down to a very nice breakfast of biscuits and gravy, a waffel, juice and coffee.
Dilly Dilly took me back to the trail and I started down the road that takes you under Rt 81. I was hit with a wave of emotion as I walked away. I realized I was on my own now. It was bittersweet. 
When I'm with a group, we all work together and keep track of each other. This can be frustrating at times, but it is also nice to have each other to rely on and work with. Alone, I had only myself to worry about and rely on. It was freeing, but also a little scary.
I know that in time this nice feeling of solitude will become a dreaded loneliness,  but today I felt good.
I still can't lift my left arm above my chest without help and can't lift any kind of weight at all, but I found I could operate my treking pole with no problem. It also seemed to loosen up during the day.
The day became beautiful as I moved along some nice trail. I entered a grassy pasture and was extra careful on the muddy parts. I came upon three cows standing on the other side of the creek. They seemed to pose for me, so I took a photo. Two more came up to join the party, so I took another.
I came upon two hikers talking in a field and met Kudzu and Cap. We discussed an interesting smell in the area that to smelled like cherry pie. It was weird.
The day seemed to flow nicely. I leaped frogged all day with Kudzu and a group of four young hikers and saw Fungi again as he broke camp.
I stopped for lunch at a nice stream, but hadn't taken an earlier break. I came to the Holston River and the water was high on the bridge, but not flowing over like I had seen in videos. It was the perfect height for a nice foot soak, so that's what I did.
Earlier I had listened to my iPod for an hour and I guess when I took my phone out of my pocket for a photo, it had fallen out. Luckily one of the group of four was behind me and she had picked it up. I'm such a klutz. She reunited me with my iPod as I pulled off my socks for the soak. It was very refreshing.
The rest of the day went well as I made my up the last of the hills. I sent a text to LoGear at the last peak with my weak roaming signal and moved on to the shelter.
When I arrived, Fungi and Turtle 77 were there. I found a spot and set up. This was my earliest arrival in camp so far this Phase, but I was happy to be done for the day.
A few other hikers came in later. Some moving on, some staying. I hung out at the shelter for awhile,  then headed to my beloved hanging bed to relax and get ready for the end of the day.
My shoulder is achey, so I hope I can sleep tonight. 
Tomorrow is scheduled as a short day, but I will most likely move on a few more miles if I'm feeling good. A 20 is a possibility, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.

I slept decently, my shoulder not hurting too much and was rolling out right at 06. I made my coffee and packed up, hitting the trail at 07. I wasn't sure how far I would go today. Plan A was a short 9.4 to Chestnut Knob shelter, but I was pretty sure I would move on. The far choice would be 20.1, but I was pretty sure I wasn't ready for that far yet. I wasn't.
The day started out easy, with some down hill, then the long climb started. At first it was pretty steep and I slowed way down. Eventually, the incline became less severe and I was able to cruise into the shelter.
I didn't take my first break until almost 10, but I took a second one at a spring by a pond. The bullfrogs were croaking. I also say a young deer as I entered the clearing. After the initial climb in the woods, the trail came out into a meadow like clearing that lasted up to the shelter.
I arrived at the shelter and had a leisurely lunch and laid on the grass for a while. I decided that I would do another 1.5 to a campsite listed in the app that had water nearby. My feet were hurting a bit which confirmed that I wasn't going to do 20 today.
I slowly made my way down the steep trail as I lost all the elevation that I had worked so hard to gain in the morning. 
Near the gap, I saw a car parked next to the trail. As I walked past, I saw an old man sitting in the car doing a crossword. It was Warren Doyle.  We talked for a bit, then I moved on to the trail that led to a small clearing where a house had once been.
It was still early in the day, but I was happy to be done walking for now. At least I had moved further than Plan A. 
I started looking around for a place for the hammock, my first choice not working.  I found a good spot, but there was a dead tree nearby. I set up, then got my bear bag line and threw it up onto the dead tree and shook it until the top 15 feet fell off. The rest feels pretty sturdy.  Fingers crossed.
I laid in my hammock for awhile, then went for some water. The spring was flowing good. I brought some water back up and rinsed out my shirt and underwear, then cleaned off since I was all alone in the clearing.
I made dinner then built a small fire.  
Tomorrow will go beyond Plan A also. I'm trying to shorten the hike to Trents Grocery, where I hope to get some hot food,  resupply a little and hopefully camp for the night. So tomorrow should be 13.6 to Laurel Creek, which is another camping place.

I was alone in the clearing all night. The rest of the dead tree didn't fall on me. My shoulder did keep bothering me though, so I took some Tylenol during the night.
Since I was in bed so early the night before, I was awake in the rack for awhile waiting for the dawn. I rolled out at 0540 as soon as I could see around. 
The first order business was cathole digging. No privies nearby, so I had to dig my first of this phase. No biggie.
Next I made breakfast and packed up. I filled my water and was walking down the trail before 07.
It looked like it was going to be another nice day and it was. My plans were loose today. I wanted to get close to the Brushy Mountain Outpost  so I could get some good food, so I was at least going 14 miles. Yesterday was nice with the short day, but I think I stopped too early. There was too much daylight wasted yesterday, so the plan was to take my time, but go later into the day.
I enjoyed the beautiful day and the nice terrain, not seeing anyone at all except two trail maintainers until I was close to the shelter for lunch.
Just before the shelter a hiker passed me. I followed him into the shelter and we had lunch. He is a young man from Denmark with the trail name Great Dane. He only has a couple months here until he has to start college, so he was hiking fast.  He was hoping to get to Harpers Ferry  before running out of time, but after our talk, he now wants to make it to Pine Grove Furnace for the half gallon challenge.
After lunch I continued on. I only had about four miles to my original destination, so I decided I would push on. First two more miles, then another two.
When I got to Laurel Creek I stopped to soak my feet, drink a whole liter of water and fill my bottles. The campsite I was heading to would be a dry camp.
When I was there another hiker came in. He realized that he had lost his filter. He left his pack and headed back, hoping it wasn't too far back. When he hadn't come back after awhile, I filtered some of my water into his bottle, refilled mine and headed out. (He did find his filter)
I thought the climb up to the ridge was going to be a killer, but it had some nice switchbacks so I made good time.
As I was approaching my spot for the night, two hikers passed me. They were taking a break at the fire ring. We talked a bit and they moved on, trying to get to the store tonight before it closed.
I set up and made dinner. There still seems like a lot of daylight left, but my feet were happy to be done for the day. 
This was the longest day of the phase so far and there are going to have to be a lot more like these as I have to average 14.5 miles a day if I want to finish on schedule.
Right now I'm at 13.1, so not too bad. Tomorrow I want to eat some cooked food, maybe resupply some stuff and then get at least to the second shelter down the trail.

My shoulder hurt a lot during the night, but I got my sleep. Visions of a hot breakfast got me out of the hammock at 0645 and I went about packing up and still made my coffee.
I headed out and did the three short miles to the store. I went in and ordered some breakfast and a sandwich for later amd was able to resupply for the rest of the push. It was delicious.
I hung out charging my electronics and was able to clean up my inbox and sent LoGear a text. I checked the radar and saw a storm was approaching.  After waiting awhile it was only sprinkling and the forecast looked like it wouldn't be too heavy, so I headed out.
After some road walking the trail re-entered the woods and started climbing. As I made my way up the rain came down harder and soon I was soaked. A shelter was close by so I headed there to wring out and wait out the heavy stuff. 
When I got there, there were two people there. When I introduced myself, they asked if I was Coast Guard. Thay had heard of me from someone. They were Snoboat and Grey Goose. Snoboat was retired CG too and Grey Goose was the sister of a guy I had workes with in DC.
We talked until the rain slowed down then hit the trail. The rest of the day was walking through a dripping forest with wet feet. I saw several Red Efts along the way. I guess they like to come out when it rains.
I met another guy from Denmark who passed me and a couple came by as I moved along.
I got water just before the shelter. There were several people there already, but I found a nice spot quickly and set up.
I ate at the table and talked a bit with the others.  When I said my name another lady knew I was from Pittsburgh. It seems someone was mentioning me to others.
I'm hoping tomorrow isn't as wet and my feet stay dry as I get closer to the end of this push I'm not sure if I will walk down to Trents tomorrow.

Once again my shoulder was painful at night, but I got my sleep and rolled out just berfoe 06 again. 
The shelter area was pretty crowded last night. I counted eight tents in the area and came upon a few more down the trail some.
I ate, packed up and was out just after 07. The day looked like it would be a good one and it was. The morning walk was over easy terrain, so I just took my time. I wasn't in any hurry. The day was only going to be 14 some miles with a couple of detours for food and a waterfall. 
I came upon Snoboat and Grey Goose  a ways down the trail and talked a bit before moving on.
When I got to the road to the store I started down the road the .5 miles. The sun was out and it was a beautiful day.
I ordered a pizza and got some other things to snack on and drink and dried out some of my clothes in the sun.
There was a cute dog hanging out that must get fed a lot as she seemed to know what she was doing. Of course I gave her some.
The store was ok, but I'm glad I didn't need any resupply. The pickins seemed slim. If I had wanted to stay there, I'm not sure there were any good trees to hang from. I'm glad I shifted everything forward and didn't need to stay there.
I ate half my pizza and packed the rest out for dinner. Back down the road and into the woods. 
I moved along towards the next feature. Dismal falls. I wanted to soak my feet and change my socks. I don't think the toe socks are working for my anymore. They seem to aggravate my little toe. 
.3 down a side trail was the falls. They were nice and the water was chilly. I did my soak and put on different socks and all was good the rest of the day.
Another few miles and I was turning to the shelter. There was only Fungi and Scraps there when I came in, but others showed up later. Mostly new faces.
I had some good roaming signal so I was able to text LoGear and call the Motel in Pearisburg to make a reservation.
We talked around the table as a few sprinkles would fall from time to time.  I'm not sure if a storm is coming or it is just scattered stuff coming through. We shall see.
Tomorrow I just need to get near the road to town so I can nero in, get my chores done, eat some town food and relax.

The night went as usual with the exception of a surprise visitor. It was around 0300 and I had gotten up to pee and my shoulder was making falling back to sleep hard. The moon was out and keeping things visible. I open my eyes and see a mouse climbing up my bugnet.  I give him a smack and he falls to the bottom of the net. One more hit and he was gone. The hazards of sleeping near a shelter I guess.
It had rained off and on overnight with some thunder and lightning thrown in, but had ended by morning. I had my coffee  and packed up. I noticed a lot of little inch worms around. A precursor of what was coming. 
The morning stroll was pleasant in the drippy woods with a pretty mellow climb up the mountain. It rolled around up top then descended into Sugar Run Gap where the Woods Hole Hostel is.
I made my way to Docs Knob shelter for lunch. There was a maintenance crew there and they had sodas and apples for us. I enjoyed both as we had some nice conversation about the trail.
I hung out for an hour and started on the last six miles to the spot I wanted to get to so I could have a short nero in the morning.
As I made my way up the last mountain before the turn off, the weather turned dark. Clouds were rolling in and rain was imminent. I was getting close and trying to hurry along the sometimes rocky trail and of course I slid again and my shoulder gave a painful reminder that it isn't right. After the pain subsided some, I move on and turned down the side trail. 
There were two hikers already here who had told me they were coming there, Calves and Goldilocks, another Dane. 
I found a good spot aand started setting up, but not before picking off about a thousand inch worms that were everywhere. On my hat and shirt and pants. My pack and everything else. They were everywhere.
After noticing them in the morning, we had been seeing them all day. Hanging in front of you as you walked along. Sitting on the bushes next to the trail. You could see that they were feasting on the bushes.
I picked them off until I couldn't see any more, but more keep showing up. They are harmless, but gross. I'm sure I will be finding them for several days.
So I got set up and debugged and the rain started. My feet had gotten pretty wet at the end of the day as the teail had a lot of water running in it from last night's storm. I laid in my hammock and had a cold dinner of mayo bacon bits and cheese spread on a tortilla. It was pretty good.
I hope to get up and out in the morning and head back to the matrix where a hot breakfast and many other things await me. I'm looking forward to a shower, laundry and more food with a full day in town.

During the night I would look out at my pack and see it was covered in inch worms. All of them standing up and reaching out like thick hairs. My tarp had a coating of worm shit all over it. They were even on my shoes. 
As soon as it was light enough, that is what I did.  Around 06 I rolled out and spent at least 30 minutes picking those fuckers off. I got everything in the pack and tried to clean off my tarp with my bandana.  I has to rinse it twice in the stream. 
Finally I got out of there just before 07. No coffee or breakfast, but that was ok. I was only 3 miles from town. 
I walked up the spring trail and onto the AT. I only had to walk another .5 or so to get out of the infested area. I kept stopping and picking off worms so I wouldn't spread the infestation, but I'm  sure those buggers will be turning up for a couple more days.
It was slow going down the mountain as the trail was very muddy and I really couldn't  risk hurting my shoulder more.
On the way down, nature called, so I made that pit stop and saw Calves and Goldilocks pass by. I got to the road right behind them and we walked the 1 mile to town together. 
Our first stop was Hardees for some breakfast, then the DQ for a blizzard.
At that point I headed out alone to locate my motel and do a few chores as it was still too early to check in.
I went to the post office and got a box to send a few things home that I didn't need (pack cover, toe socks, pant legs, parts of AWOL guide).  I got the 2018 AWOL guide as the 2017 one was bothering me with its minor changes. I cut it down so I only have a small section (Damascus to HF).
I went to Rite Aid to get my bride a birthday card, then headed to the Hotel to check in. 
I was still a little early, but I was able to put my pack in the room and I just hung out in front and started drying out my shoes. 
After a short while the room was ready and I moved in and started unpacking. I gathered all my nasty clothes and took a nice shower. I brought my tarp into the shower and washed all the worm shit off that was still on it, then washed myself.
I took my clothes to the lady at the desk and she washed them for me. Awesome service. I checked my food bag to see what I still had and what I needed for resupply and figured out a rough plan on the next Push. Push 12 - The Push to Daleville. 93.8 miles. I hope to take six days to get there.
I called LoGear and we talked until my clothes were done, then I went back to the post office, mailed off the box, then went shopping at Food Lion.
After sorting all my food and packing my food bag, I walked over to Angels Rest to see if they had any books I could ""borrow"".
On the way over I saw Odie's bus and talked to him for awhile, then continued to the hostel.
I found a nice woman, Commando, who worked there and asked if I could get a book and she said yes, but I had to tell her my favorite quote. I used one that I had been thinking about for awhile and write in registers from time to time.  ""Even your worst day on the trail will be a story you will tell later."" I found a decent book to try and headed to the AYCE Chinese restaurant for some dinner.
After walking out way too full, I headed back to the room to finish this journal entry, do some more planning and relaxing until bed time.
This was a much needed and very appreciated rest and recharge and I will be ready to hit the trail again tomorrow. I don't need no steenking zeros. At least not yet. 
I'm not sure how far tomorrow will be, but I may try that 20, but my pack will be heavy with food and there are places to stop early if I have to that I can make up over the next couple of days.
I'm enjoying making a rough plan, then updating and altering as reality pans out. I go with the flow.Push 12 starts in the morning.

I slept like shit on that motel bed last night.  I'm going to stop mentioning what was the culprit (shoulder). Oh well.
I still was able to get up before 06. I took another shower and ate the avocado I bought yesterday. It was pretty ripe, so I had put it in the fridge, but it had been turned way down so the avocado was a little frozen.
I packed up and headed to Hardees for breakfast. After that, I headed back up the road to the trail. The going was pretty easy for awhile, with some road walking to cross a river. Soon I passed the factory that is the main industry of Pearisburg. I was told they make the material for cigarette filters.
When I was back in the woods, I passed a deer feeding up the hill. She basically ignored me. 
I continued up and came to some signs. This was the place where they are putting in a mountain valley pipeline. I had read some about it, but don't remember the details. I remembered that there are protesters sitting up a pole somewhere nearby. I saw a sign to that effect saying it was a 45 min walk to visit them. Good luck fella.
I went up to Rice Field shelter for lunch.  It is at the top of the mountain next to a field. I thought there wouldn't be a view due to the fog, but I had a pretty nice one looking down into the valley. 
I went a little further and stopped to get water.  I saw a hiker pass me as I came back up. Not too much later Calves caught me and I hiked with him for awhile. 
The terrain was was pretty good and we made good time. There were some rocks from time to time, but not too bad. 
Eventually, we came to a steep climb and I fell behind. That was ok. I didn't have too far to go and my feet were demanding some attention from time to time.
I got to the shelter area and found a spot. Not too long after I set up, another two hikers came in. 
The day had been pretty good all day. After dinner when I had retired to my hammock a little rain came through. This was my first 20 miler of this Phase
Tomorrow I hope to do another long day, which will set me up to finish this push in six days.

I slept pretty good, so you would think the day would go well too, right? Wrong! Today sucked. 
I ate bfast, packed up and headed out just after 07. At first it was ok, just strolling through the woods, but my energy seemed low. Then came a climb that was straight up that kicked my ass. Next, in a rocky section, I slipped and fell and broke my pole. The day wasn't going well at all.
I packed the broken pole away and asked the trail to provide me a temporary walking stick. About 30 minutes later a branch was laying across the trail. I broke off an appropriately sized piece and continued on. It was wet and muddy, but I cleaned it off at the next stream and scraped off the bark where my hand held it and it worked quite well.
I kept trying to send a text to LoGear for her birthday, but signal was nonexistent. Even at the highest points of the day.
After a lunch at Wind Rock, I took a break at the next shelter and was contemplating  stopping early at a campsite up the hill. But first I had to climb that hill. It totally kicked my ass, but one good thing was I got some signal halfway up and was able to text LoGear. I needed inspiration getting up the hill so I imagined LoGear up ahead of me and I kept working to get to her.
When I got to the top I was determined to finish the 18.5 day. I sat down and wrung the sweat out if my shirt, drank some water.
I made it, but it was hard. Tomorrow, I plan on taking it easy and hiking a shorter day.

Slept good and wasn't in a hurry to get up since it was a short day. I rolled out at 0630 and took my time getting ready.
The morning stroll was nice until the climb started. The trails here go straight up it seems. They really tire me out, but the  only way to get them done is one foot in front of the other. That's what I did. I took lots of breaks and after awhile I was on top.
So it's all easy from there right? No, now lets run the trail along the large rocks.  Hikers like that. Not! But the trail is the trail and I walk where it goes.  Complaining doesn't change anything, but I do it anyway.
I needed water at the next shelter and it was .3 straight down. Well they had switchbacks, but it was a climb.
After more rock walking, I crossed the eastern continental divide and started descending to Niday shelter.
This was my original destination for the day, but I decided to move on a mile or two where there were supposed to be some camps. But first, I put up my hammock and lazed around a bit, then ate dinner before moving on.
I headed down the pretty nice trail and crossed a road. I came to the first camp and all the people I have been leap frogging with were there. I found a spot and set up. Tomorrow will only be 15 something to 4 pines hostel.
I plan to be up and out early. The sound of the river is nice and I was able to wade in and clean up a bit after I set up.

I got everything done under the tarp, including coffee and grits and was on the trial at 07, just as the rain was letting up.
I started my morning stroll and saw that the camp I was planning to stay at would have been really nice. 
I started up the morning's climb and it was pretty nice. A gentle climb with lots of switchbacks. It wasn't long until I was at the top and taking a seat on a bench. I figured the trail is so nice because I was nearing the Audie Murphy memorial at the top of the mountain. I paid my respects and moved on. 
The trail followed a ridge road then descended to another road and a creek. I stopped for lunch, filled my water and moved on. The second half of the day wouldn't be so easy. 
As I made my way up Cove Mtn,  the trail did a lot of rock walking. The pinnacle of the climb was Dragon's Tooth which was stunning. Just as I started heading down, the rain started. 
Coming down from the tooth gets Very technical. At first I was enjoying it for the challenge it was, but I almost twisted my ankle in a moment if lapsed concentration. I was happy to see the sign that I thought indicated the end of the rock climb, but the trail kept going over pretty challenging stuff and after awhile, I wanted it to be done.
Well, the only way to get it done is to keep putting one foot in front if the other and that is what I did.
Finally I was at the road and I headed to the famous 4 Pines Hostel. I met Joe the owner and was pointed to the barn where I could hang my hammock. 
Outside the garage (Hostel) there was a barrel that had a bunch of trekking poles and parts. I looked inside and there sat the exact piece that I had broken. My pole was back in business and is now named Frankenpole.
I set up then went down to hang out in the Hostel (garage) and four of us went to the Homeplace for dinner.  It was amazing. Home style dinner with so much food.
We came back, stopping at the Grocery for some short term resupply.
I took a quick shower and am done for the night. Tomorrow I hope to get close to Daleville, where Push 12 will come to an end.

The rooster sent out his first call at 0445. It was far away, down the hill, so it didn't bother me. I eventually rolled out around 0545. Cruze Control amd Tent Cents were already up and moved out early. 
I packed up and went down to the Hostel to use the privy and I was heading out at 07. The walk down the road was a nice warm up. 
I turned onto the trail and started the first climb if the day. It wasn't too bad at all, with lots of switchbacks.
The first six miles were a mixture of forest and pasture.  I only saw a couple other hikers and passed a few sleeping tents. Before long I was at the 311 parking lot.
It was Sunday and the lot already had a lot  of cars in it. After a break I started up to McAfee Knob. The going wasn't too hard, but it is a climb. I got up just in time for lunch. 
Two hikers I had passed on the way up came up and I asked Down Hill to take my photo on the Knob. He is hiking with White Sands.
I continued on, not going fast, just hiking along. After more miles and another long climb, I was at Tinker Cliffs. I met three guys from Ohio there who were out for a three day loop. The day had become beautuful and I enjoyed taking a break there and talking with the guys.
But the day isn't done until the miles are walked, so on I went to Lamberts Meadow Shelter. I arrived at 1650 and found a spot for my hammock. LoGear and I had stayed here five years ago. I don't think I'm in the same spot, but I am in the same area near the creek.
Tomorrow Push 12 comes to an end and I will be taking a zero day just to rest up for the final Push of this Phase.  Push 13 will be the longest one yet of Phase III.

The terrain was pretty nice and I moved along quickly as it rolled along the ridges then descended into town. 
I recalled a few of the places from when we hiked here in 2013 and the day's hike went quickly, with no drama.
I found myself coming to the busy road right at 1130. I saw across the street a smoker going and crossed to go catch a whiff of what was cooking. 
I went inside and bought some lunch, then hung out at their picnic tables for an hour. I crossed the street again and went into the Howard Johnsons and checked in.
Shower, laundry and pack explosion followed and it all felt so good. I called LoGear to catch up and started planning the last Push of Phase III.
This will be the longest Push of the Phase and I'm hoping to do it without having to resupply, but that may be a challenge.
I went for a swim in the pool, then had dinner at Pizza Hut, changing it up with pasta and wings instead of pizza.
I watched a couple of shows on my phone and hit the hay. Tomorrow, I will head to Kroger to buy the last of my food and will spend the day relaxing as much as possible.

At first it seemed I would be alone at the shelter, but others came in including a small group of girl scouts.  After the steep walk back up to the trail I saw the others who had camped up top. The first part of the day was nice as the trail undulated up and down, with no steep climbs or descents.  When I took a break at a shelter, there was a doe hanging out nearby.  Not afraid of us at all.  I ate lunch at Jennings Creek that had a nice swimming hole where people were hanging out, but I didn't swim.  After lunch was the big climb of the day.  It was, as usual, an ass kicker.  I slowly made my way up it as usual.I arrived at Bryant Ridge Shelter, which was my original goal of the day.  It is a huge shelter, but there are no good hanging spots around it.  The terrain is rather steep and the forest is young, with all smaller trees.  After a break where I was able to hang my hammock in the shelter for a bit, I packed up and started up the hill.  After going about .9, I found a established campsite at the top of one of the hills.  There were some good trees here, so I set up.  I had good signal here and called LoGear to catch up.  I watched as a bunch of hikers passed by, trying to get this climb done.  I would wait to finish in the morning.  After I had set up, I saw something behind the camping spot.  It was a deuce of spades. A light, but expensive cat hole digger.  I had looked at them with envy before, but there was no way I was going to pay $20 for a hole digger.  The trail provided me one for free. I was excited to try it out in the morning.Fauna: lizards, deerVOD: overlookHigh: Having signal to call LoGearLow: The climb after lunchHope: Rain holds off","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Time stop and miles: 1426-12.37. End point: Harrison Ground Spring campsiteLog:I slept pretty good all alone. Heard a weird call early in the morning. Sort of a screech. Maybe it was bigfoot. I woke up thinking about my mother.  Today is her birthday and I asked her to give me the strength to get up the day's climbs.  I felt her presence all day. 
I was up early trying out my new deuce of spades I found behind the campsite. I was all packed up and out before 07 to finish the climb. I just took my time as it was another short day, made even shorter by yesterday's necessity of having to move on to find a hang site.  It was funny.  I had just had a conversation the day before with Two Crows.  We were discussing hanging and he asked if I ever had a problem finding a hang site.  I had told him that to that point, I hadn't ever not found a place where I had planned.  I guess the Trail had heard and had to show me some humility.
I had dry camped the night before, so getting water was at the top of the list.  I came to a campsite that had a spring and had to walk down pretty far to get water, but it wasn't too bad.  
After a morning break at a shelter, Apple Orchard Mountain needed to be climbed.  It was another challenging climb, but I had a nice lunch at the top where a FAA tower dominated the landscape.  Shortly after that, the steep rocky descent brought me to the Guillotine. A popular rock feature.  
Today, I was in no hurry and took breaks at a second shelter and at an overlook.  I made it into camp nice and early and would be alone again as all the others were moving further along.  There was nice water nearby, but the bugs were waiting for me.  I just settled into my hammock and closed the bug net to keep them away.  I read a bit and went to sleep early.
Tomorrow will be my last short day and then the challenging days begin as we work to finish this Push and Phase. I am increasingly becoming ready to finish this Phase.  Walking all day staring at rocks gets old after a time. 
I have just about enough food to last me all the way to Rockfish Gap, but I can tell I'm definitely calorie deficient.  I can feel a tiredness creep into me each day as I burn all my calories walking up and down mountains.  I may have to get into Glasgow to load up on some town food if the opportunity presents itself.

It was all over in the morning and I was up and out as usual before 07. The morming stroll was nice. I didn't see anyone for awhile, but a doe stood in the trail and waited for me to turn on my phone and take a pic. I got within about 10 feet before she jumped up the hillside a little to let me pass.There was only one challenging hill of about 700 feet that I slowly made my way up in the morning. The trail was pretty good and I had town food on my mind, so I made good time to the river and crossed the longest footbridge on the AT. I only took one short break at the shelter.I got to the road and put my thumb out. After a few cars had passed me, I saw a pickup with a kayak on a rack start up. I asked the guy if I could get a ride into Glasgow and he waved me over.I jumped in the back and five windy miles later I was in town. First stop was lunch at Scotto's. I got a double bacon cheeseburger and loaded fries. After that, I went to the post office to see if they had any automatic machines where I could sent a box home, but no. But I had an idea. I pucked up a medium box and went to the dollar general for a few snacks and a drink. Next I was heading to the Hostel when I saw a lady waving me over. She was Donna the caretaker at the Hostel. Just the person I needed to talk to.  She said she could mail a box for me and I also made arrangements for her to take me back to the trail.She dropped me at the hiker pavilion and I relaxed there, took a shower and talked with the other hikers. I filled the box with all the things I didn't need for these last five days. Trying to get my pack as light as possible. She picked me up at 1530 and I gave her the box and some money.I was back on the trail before 1600 and at the shelter 40 min later.It's raining a little again, but I'm snug in my hammock for the night.

Time stop and miles: 1625-18.3 7. End point: Brown Mountain Creek shelter Log:I was up early and out before 07. The morning climbs went pretty well.  They were nicely graded and I just went along at my own slow pace and before I knew it, I was done with them.  Once again I saw two deer that hang out on the trail and wait looking at me as if I'm the one who will step off the trail and let them pass.  I also saw a couple of rabbits dart across the trail as I approached.  I like the mornings on the trail.  I'm usually alone as the kids sleep in and catch me later and the wildlife are still moving about.I had lunch at an overlook and had no energy after lunch.  Rice Mountain, which didn't even show up on my radar as a hard climb actually took a lot out of me. The trail was pretty empty today as most of those I have been hiking with have been doing longer days, but I did see myself catching another hiker as I neared Reservoir road, where I was planning another break and getting some water.I caught Triple Rainbow just as we got to the road and we hung out together.  She is nursing a knee issue, so I got her water for her. After the break we both started together, but I quickly pulled ahead. Not a common occurrence for me.  It was pleasant hiking around the reservoir as the trail followed the contour on the hillside.  As I walked along, the rumble of thunder came rolling along the ridge and after awhile the rain came down fairly heavy.  It was actually refreshing and gave me some renewed energy as I was cooled off with the soaking.  The storm only lasted about 10 minutes and the sun was out again with the last of the rain still falling. I'm sure there was a rainbow somewhere, but being in the forest, I couldn't see it.  I arrived at the shelter and once again the pickings were slim for a descent hang, but I found a spot and set up.  This area was interesting as it was an old freed slave settlement back in the late 1800s.  You could see some remnants of a stone wall along the creek, but not much else is left as the forest has reclaimed the land.  Triple Rainbow came in and elected to stay in the shelter and a group of four also caught us at the end of the day.  I had met a couple of them going into Glasgow as I was heading out the other day. The 18.3 went pretty well.  Tomorrow, will be a little easier with 15.8, but once again there will be a climb in the morning.Flora: Fallen Mountaun Laurel flowers looking like spilled popcornFauna: Deer, rabbits, squirrel, frogVOD: Bluff MtnSound: thunderHigh: Sitting on Bluff Mtn after my climbsLow: Rice Mtn surprised me","Johns Hollow Shelter

End point: Seeley-Woodworth ShelterLog:I was up and out quick again as there was another 2700 feet to climb in the morning and getting it done in the cool of the morning was the plan. It was wet and foggy in the woods.  You could feel that something was coming and it wasn't sunshine. The climb actually wasn't too bad.  Once again it was well graded with lots of switchbacks and I was up in due time. It was eerie up on Cole Mountain, where it opened up into meadows and fields and the fog was so thick, it felt as if you were walking in a dream. I could hear hikers coming at me, but didn't see them until they were very close.  I came down to Hog Camp Gap where there were some campsites and water an easy .3 away, so I decided to eat lunch a little early.  I saw Freight Train, who said he was taking a zero in his tent as the day was crappy and his knee was bothering him.  I decided to have a cold cup of coffee at lunch to try and keep my energy up and it seemed to help as I moved on after lunch. As I moved along slowly, I heard a hello from behind.  It was eWolf once again.  I thought they had passed me for the last time a couple days ago.  We talked a bit and he said that he had hit some nettles and his leg was tingling.  He also mentioned that he had heard of a plant that helps that he thought was called forget me not.  I told him about Jewelweed aka Touch Me Not and looked down to see one growing at my feet.  I picked it and showed him how to crush the stem and apply the juice.  He did so and moved on.  It felt good to impart some woods lore on a fellow hiker.  The rain started just after noon and keep off an on all the way to the shelter in the afternoon.  At first I just walked with no rain gear, but when I get soaked, I need to put it on just to keep warm and that is what I eventually did.  Luckily, the terrain wasn't challenging in the afternoon and I arrived in camp nice and early once again after a decently long day.  I checked the shelter where I saw hikers already wrapped in their down, trying to get their core warmed up and I set up fast between the showers and got out of my wet clothes and into my own down.  I cooked dinner from my hammock and went to sleep early once again.  Tomorrow was going to be the long day of this last Push.

The forest was still drippy, but it appeared that the rain was done for now.  I packed up quickly and hit the trail so I could warm up.  The first couple of miles were easy then the first climb was before me.  It was only 700' and I was able to take a break 3/4 of the way up at the Priest Shelter.  This is the shelter where you are supposed to confess your sins in the shelter register.  After reading some other's disturbing deeds, I added my own.  Since confession is supposed to be anonymous, I will keep mine that way.  I tried a new tactic to get myself up the hill.  I told myself a story.  Just a little something that came to me as I walked along.  It kept me occupied and distracted enough to get the hill done.  It was fun to do it that way.The after lunch climb was a challenging 3.3 miles rising 2000'.  I used music to get me up this one.  My iPod battery was getting low, so I just said I would listen until it died, but it ended up lasting all the way to the shelter.For the last couple of days, I have been seeing an insect fly past me that I'm calling a Forest Fairy.  They remind me of the things we called Santa Clause, which are fluffy seed pods that float around in the wind, but these I could tell were being propelled some way.  The thing is, I would see them for about half a second and then they would disappear in front of me. Eventually I was able to follow one and see that it was a larged legged insect with small wings that are invisible when they are flying.  I wonder what they are. When I was about seven miles from the shelter, I came to a sign that showed a blue blazed trail that led to the shelter in only three miles.  I stood there for a minute or two, but I knew I would be climbing Three Ridges and not taking the easy route.  I was out here to walk the trail. Any bypasses I had taken were for a reason and one of the reasons I never use is to cut off mileage.  I continue on.I got into camp and set up. I had completed a long day and was feeling good.  I met Begonia, a southbound hiker with striking blue hair.  She had started in PA and was trying to get to TN, but a tooth problem has laid her up for a week in Waynesboro.  They have a bear pole here, so for the first time in a long time, I didn't sleep with my food.  It was already getting dark as I finished up dinner and headed to my hammock.  It had been a long day.  I was done with the long days though.  Tomorrow would be 15.8 once again and then another five the last day and I would be seeing my bride, LoGear, who was coming to pick me up as I finished this Phase of my Quest. Fauna: Forest FairiesVOD: The PriestSmell: flowersHigh: Seeing the sun come out for awhileLow: Slogging up Three Ridges Mtn Hope: A nice easy day tomorrow","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

Time stop and miles: 1545/15.87. End point: Paul C. Wolfe ShelterLog:There were sprinkles off and on overnight, but it was clear in the morning.  I was out early once again. The morning climb wasn't too hard, but there were a lot of rocks.  As the day warmed up, the rocks started to sweat and made walking over them even more precarious.  I took a break at Cedar Cliffs which had a nice view.  The climb up from Laurel Springs Gap was very steep with lots of stone steps.  It slowed me down quite a bit.  I ate lunch at Wintergreen view, which was a ski resort across the valley. After that I had a long downhill coming down from Humpback Mountain.  On the way down, everyone needed water, so we had a bit of a crowd at the one spring we came to.  We all worked together and everyone got their water and were on their way again.  I kept leapfrogging Dog Whisperer and a group of three slack packers, plus the foursome I had met a few days ago. As I was starting my final descent towards the shelter, I saw Dog Whisperer talking on his phone.  I had traded a couple text messages with LoGear during the day, trying to plan tomorrow's meetup, so I checked and saw I had good signal.  Her last text didn't make sense to me, so I called her.  She answered and let me know that she was about to park near the visitor's center at Rockfish Gap and was bringing in hoagies for dinner.  I was elated.  There were tears.  I was so ready to be done and to see her, that I had been counting sleeps for the last couple of days until I would see here again.  She was coming a day early!  I was so happy.I floated down the mountain the last mile or so and found four trees to use for us.  I put my tarp at one spot to save the spot and my hammock at the other.  I hung out at the shelter with the others who had come in for the night and probably pissed them off a little as I thought about all the ""other world"" things I would be doing the next day, like taking showers and shitting on a real toilet and eating cold, fresh food that I had taken out of a refrigerator.  I was so ready to be done.It was good seeing a couple of the hikers that I hadn't seen since Pearisburg or so.  They are all such good people.  I will be missing them, but I was happy to be finishing this Phase and taking off my pack, unpacking it and not repacking it again the next day.  My itch had been scratched.Right at 1800, I saw LoGear coming down the trail.  She had made great time and I ran to greet her.  I had missed her so much.  I introduced her to all and we sat down and ate our store bought, handmade, hoagies.  Yum!LoGear setup and after hanging out at the shelter for awhile, we retired to our perspective hammocks and I fell asleep with a satisfied smile on my face.  Tomorrow we finish Phase III.Fauna: 2 fawnsVOD: Cedar CliffsSound: My darlings voiceHigh: Seeing LoGear walking into campLow: The climb after Laurel Springs GapHope: Shower, hot tub, food, my bed...","Maupin Field Shelter

I enjoyed a hot coffee up at the shelter talking to Squirrel, Molasses and Smiley as LoGear got up and packed up. I finished my pack up and we were on the trail around 0720. The short hike out was easy and we made good time to the gap.When we reached the road, I walked up to the point where we had started north into Shenandoah last year. As I approached, I saw Big Tuna and Kaleidoscope getting ready to head out. I wished them well and said goodbye before heading back to where LoGear was waiting. I'll admit I had a tear or two in my eyes. I was happy to be done hiking, but this kind of life can be intense.We got to the car amd headed to the ymca for a free shower and got into some fresh non-hiking clothes, then headed over to Mings AYCE restaurant. Google said it opened at 10 and we walked in at 1030. The only thing ready was the salad bar, but we were seated (in the regular seating area, not the hiker area). We got some salad and I checked the website to see that they actually open at 11. We weren't in a hurry, so we hung out until all the other food was out. Squirrel came in and they sat him in the seperare hiker area, but he came over and sat with us. We filled our bellies, then headed out and headed home.Three plus hours later we were unloading our packs in the basement. The final weight of my pack with virtually no food was 22.6 lbs. I wish it was close to that all of the time.Phase III was complete.  I have now hiked 1593.3 miles of the Trail, with only VT, NH and ME to be walked. I'm pretty sure I'm finished hiking for now.  I will rest and reflect some more and I need to get my shoulder checked out, but I think Phase IV will wait for another season (or more).  I'll follow up with another Post-Hike entry in a few days, but for now, I'm enjoying being back in this world of leisure.  I have TV shows to watch and a garden to attend to.  Hot tubs to sit in and showers to take, every day.  Hiking long distance is an interesting challenge, but for now. I may become a camper again for a bit.  Time will tell.  Until then, The Quest is still there to continue.  I'm just not sure when that will happen.Peace,EarthTone","Paul C. Wolfe Shelter

EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597596,"I've been Off Trail for a little over a month and I thought it was time for a little post trail update.So, if you have been following here, you may remember me whining about my shoulder from about May 22nd until I finished Phase III on June 14th.  On the 22nd, only about a week into the Phase, I fell on a sloped grassy and muddy part of the trail as we rushed to finish Push 10.  LoGear was ahead of me and Dilly Dilly was behind and I don't think either of them heard my squeal of pain when I fell, but at that moment a vision of not being able to continue was very clear in my mind.  When it happened, I couldn't move my arm for a few minutes and then I couldn't lift it above my head without helping it with my right hand, but as I continued along, I found that I could still hike.  I just had to be careful to not fall again.  (Good luck with that)LoGear and Dilly Dilly went home at the end of Push 10 and I continued on for another three Pushes. Each day, I could hike with my poles with negligible pain and at night I would deal with the constant throbbing as I lay in my hammock. Vitamin I, Tylenol PM and Naproxen became my new hiking partners. I was able to finish the next three Pushes and completed Phase III on schedule.  When I got to Rockfish Gap, I was pretty sure that I needed to get my shoulder checked out as I was also pretty sure, it would be a lot harder to hike injured up in NH and ME which is all I need to hike (along with VT) to finish this Quest.Also, I won't sugar coat it, I have confirmed that about a month is my limit for being out on a long distance hike.  After about four weeks, that whisper in my mind telling me how much I miss all the comforts of the Other World becomes a scream.  I'm perfectly OK with that.  I have come to realize that I can only handle so much Type Two fun.  With close to 600 miles left, I was pretty sure that Phase IV was going to have to wait for next season (or beyond?)So, back to my shoulder.  A couple doctor's visits, an X-Ray and MRI confirmed what I already was quite sure of. I have a couple tears in the tendons of my left shoulder.  I was given four options.  1. Do nothing and see if it will heal (six weeks of that already, no).2. Physical Therapy: (from what I have seen, it's real hard to fix a tear that way, no)3. Steroid shots: (those don't really agree with me. I tried some steroids when my back went out. I didn't like the feeling, no)4. Surgery to fix the tears.  Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.  The Ortho Dr said I may have an 8 to 12 month recovery time, but I took that as a challenge to be back and ready to go in about six.  Time will tell.So the surgery is scheduled for Aug 16th.  I still have a lot of trouble sleeping every night. A bed is not as forgiving as my hammock was, but I hope to get my shoulder back to working order (or at least start in that direction) next month.  Until then, I will enjoy this Other World and all its comforts like showers, toilets, food that is kept in a fridge, TV, Computers, WiFi, clean clothes, driving and the insider life until I am once again ready for some Type Two fun.I'll let you know how it goes.",,View Entry,"Jul 19, Thu",0
EarthTone and LoGear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609984,"My shoulder is pretty much good to go.  Now, I just have to wait for the calendar to roll around to my start date.  I have about 48 more sleeps until I hit the Trail.  I'm ready now, but the Trail isn't quite ready for me.  In VT, they ask that you don't start using the Trail until Memorial Day, so that is my start date to get back ""on Trail"" at Williamstown, MA.  The hardest part about this multiphase Quest is the waiting to get back on Trail.  
I have a rental car (pickup truck) reserved and plan on heading up to Mass, getting a motel room, drop off the truck in Albany, NY then take an Uber back to the Motel.  The next morning I will head to the Trail and start the final Phase of Pamola's Quest.  ~600 miles and around 50 more days of hiking.  
I'm starting when I am because, this time, I will have a reason to get done by a certain date.  My first born is expecting her own first born and is due mid July.  I hope to be home for the birth or as close to it as possible.
