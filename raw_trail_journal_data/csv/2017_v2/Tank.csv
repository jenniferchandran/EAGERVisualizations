Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/430493,"A dream for a long time, whats the big deal ?Throw some clothes and food in a bag and go hiking, right !!It seemed like that in the beginning. I wonder how many folks drop out of this process long before the hike even begins. With so much to do, just getting to the start at Springer Mountain Ga. seems as daunting as the hike itself. My desire to hike the AT and the opportunity at the same time to give what I can to the Woodall Foundation of Carrollton, TX. is what got me started. Approximately 3000 attempt a thru hike of the AT each year whether hiking north or south. Most follow the seasons north. While most end their attempt early on due to varies reasons such as sickness or injuries. About 10 % are successful each year and reach Mt Katadin in Maine or Springer Mt in Georgia depending on direction of hike chosen.",,"Two years in the making — Research, Planning, Trai","Mar 04, Mon",0
Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/430494,"I started my hike conditioning in Feb/2013. I began with 2.5 miles approx every 3 days. I'm up to 7 miles now for each hike, averaging about every 3 days. My goal will be a max of about 10-12 miles while training. Over the course of the coming year that should give me enough miles under my belt to be at least a half of a real hiker on the AT when I begin. I'm doing most of my training at the Fort Worth Nature Center. They have about 20 miles of trails but primarily just 1 trail that suits my purposes. Currently that trail is 7 miles in length.

I guess that’s progress.Day 3 was very wet with moderate to heavy rain and scattered thunderstorms which made things interesting and wet. I wanted to have some idea what to expect on the AT when I have to hike in the rain…day after day after day etc.Today was a good test for that and I did learn a lot about do’s and dont’s that will help to keep me and my gear dry.

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/430500,"A quick update… I hiked 10.5 miles the other day. It was pretty tough the last 3 but I didn’t give up. I think the humidity made it harder than it should have been. My water was gone by mile 9, the last mile and a half was hiked on empty… lesson learned. I saw my first snake, a copperhead warming himself on the trail. It was a little scary thinking what could have happened had I not seen him. Then, out of nowhere a turtle came rolling down the hill and landed on it’s back right in front of me. It was pretty funny to see actually. I thought about just rolling him over being the big brave game hunter that I am, then I thought better of it. I’m sure he could have bitten off my whole arm. Instead, I used my hiking pole to save him, and on down the hill he went... slowly!",,10.5 Miles!,"May 21, Tue",0

During my some spare time, I’ve been concentrating on gear… making a list and checking it twice… over and over! As you can see, I’ve been wondering how I’m going to get all this into my 60 liter Osprey. Practice, Practice, Practice! I still have a few incidentals to finish but this is pretty much all of it. I feel pretty good at this point to be as ready as I am. Now I just need to hike more. I’m not under any illusion that preparing in TX will get me ready for what’s to come on the AT, but it’s what I have to work with so I’ll make the best of it.March is coming fast… considering it was 18 months ago I decided to take up the challenge, man time flies!!-TANK   : )",,Getting in Gear,"Aug 28, Wed",0

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/435853,"Summer is waning and I’m on the trail again. Today was my first hike with a FULL pack. Most of the past 12 months were spent researching and purchasing gear that will sustain me for 5-6 months. I had a semi-official weigh-in goal of not an oz. over 30 lbs. I came scary close at 31 lbs. As I continue to make adjustments, I’ll replace items with ones that are lighter to reach my goal. I know it doesn’t seem like much and you might wonder why I would even bother, after all it’s just 1 lb. Think of it this way, carrying 1 lb 2185 miles is the same as carrying 2185 lbs 1 mile… every oz. counts!!One other thing I’d like to point out. If you haven’t seen the video in my previous blog post, please take a moment and watch. If you love your children I don’t know how this couldn’t touch your heart.If you would like to support the effort, check out my main blog at thruhikeat.com and look around.

Three miles into the hike I was soaked from the waist down because of the morning dew and soaked from the waist up because I was sweating buckets. I was way overdressed with just a fleece. Hiking provides its own heater. I have to remember if I'm comfortable when I start hiking, I have too much on. Once I packed up my fleece, hiking was perfect!I had the trail all to myself and my thoughts were on the emails that I have received from people the live near the AT and are already giving me words of encouragement and hints of possible trail magic as I make my way north...

To change it up, a few of my buddies and I decided to see how quickly we could cover 2000 miles, exactly how the actually AT hike WONT be!The gear required for this effort was considerable, my wife was going! Everyone else had similar issues to resolve but we managed to pull it all together. We headed out on Oct 10th as planned, minus 1 friend who was stuck making repairs before he could begin his trek. He actually did manage to catch up and was only 4-5 hours behind at the start. We had excellent weather which is always a good way to cover some ground and enjoy it.Anyway, I just wanted to give a quick update to say that actual preparations are going well for the real trek.

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/439903,"It’s been awhile between updates but I continue to plug along. I’m still not convinced that I have the correct footwear for the hike so I decided to go to Georgia and hike the approach trail to the AT and try to get a feeling of what I was in for. The approach Trail begins at Amicalola Falls State Park and ends at the beginning of the Appalachian Trail at the summit of Springer Mountain. Amicalola is the third highest waterfall east of the Mississippi River which is also the tallest waterfall in Georgia.It was cold, rainy, foggy, and very windy as I began my approach trail hike. The 600 steps up the falls actually went pretty well, slow and steady. By the time I made the top I was pretty wet with the rain and waterfall over spray. I felt like Jim Cantorey (sp) trying to stand up in a hurricane segment!Anyway, off I go into the woods following the trail past the Falls Resort and the “Hike Inn 1 Mile” sign. I was determined not to go tree to tree during this initial hike. (Hi Roger).The trail was very wet with lots of water, slippery rocks and mud. Man it was cold!! I actual rolled both ankles a several times, but nothing that caused issues.I met 2 other hikers which was pretty surprising considering the weather.

I have spent quite a bit of time these last couple of weeks saying good-bye to friends and family, having several last suppers, and a few drinks with much laughter. I think I have gained 10 lbs just trying to leave!!! Today I did a final pack and boxed it all up, then off to UPS for shipping to Ga. I don’t know why, but that box felt much heavier today. My final assault on pack weight will happen the night before I get on the trail at Springer. After shipping off my pack and running a few errands, I returned home to see a small pile of items I had left in a special spot so that I wouldn’t forget them…. ha. Its ok, just a small flight bag and I’m good.I had dinner with family last night and as I’m driving home, I thinking to myself that if I can eat just half as good as the dinner they prepared, it’ll almost be heaven on the trail! Thank you Brian and Carly.Thank You to all that have been so generous in giving to help fight the good fight against autism. I’m truly amazed at what you have given in support. My son built the webpage and initially had set up a $10,000 goal. I never once thought we could ever reach that goal. So we began at $5,000 (dad knew better) and a few months later bumped it back up to $10,000 (son knew better). Now we have surpassed the 2nd (original) goal and are still gaining. Thank You Thank You Thank You !!Please continue to tell your friends and family. Link us in any way you can with everyone! The goal isn’t just $10,000 – the goal is to find a cure for autism like it is to fine a cure for so many other ailments. Most of us will never know the pain and struggles that come with medical issues like autism, but to those that do, God Bless You.

Today I left Lance Creek about 9 am and tackled Blood Mountain arriving at Neels Gap around 3 pm... It kicked my butt. I'm definitely the old man in this group. I think my trail name should be Slomo!
Amazing how fast a group will form and a few days later they disperse when in town. So far everyone has been great. Very helpful. Most everyone has lots of trail experience, except me! Tonight 5 of us are holed up in this awesome cabin, then we get punished with days of rain... oh well, maybe it's better than a wind chill of 10.
I resupplied today at an outfitter... And sent home 4 lbs of stuff I hope I didn't need. My bag weight is 31 lbs and I'm thrilled. We are going into town for dinner. It's an all you can eat....!!!! I'm so ready!!!","Gooch Shelter

Another good weather day but again the trail was slush and mud. Tomorrow is a big tough day over cling man's dome... Just under 14 miles in the same trail conditions. In NC you have to stay in the shelters unless they are full, then you can tent near the shelter. I left early for today's hike and saw ""Listener"" a couple times but no one else from our group. Hiking alone made it easier to hike at a tad slower pace which has helped the knees. I know the days are coming when I'll complain about the heat, but something in between would be nice for a while.
Food has become an issue for me. I need to mix it up a bit so I have a little variety. I'll work on that on my next resupply.
I still have my cold but I think I'm feeling a bit better each day. Hopefully that means a little stronger each day too, I need that to happen. I hope that helps with the feet/leg pain each night. I'm so tired it's all I can do to blog... exhausted beyond belief.
It’s 7.30 and there must be 30 people in and around this shelter now, and of course I’m the oldest one here… What’s up with that?
We have a small Boy Scott group here, so there is energy to build a fire. All the shelters in NC have chimneys but everyone is usually too tired to build a fire. The scouts have an interesting definition of old… If you are over 41 you are elderly. … End of story!

I wasn’t getting any younger and the built in flexibility of my job allowed me to juggle the time off..... I’m going!!
There are so many reasons we all do things....big things, little things, difficult things and sometimes things that seem impossible. For me, at that moment, I took my first steps of what was to become one of the most amazing, incredible experiences I’d ever know. I had no illusions about the difficulty that was in store for me and it didn’t take long for those tests to begin.
We are never given more than we can handle, even though the outcome may be different than we planned for. I held on to that each night in my little nylon one man sanctuary in the few moments of quiet before sleep would rush over me and allow me to forget how totally exhausted I was.
I have to be honest and say that in the first week as we ( I mean me) struggled against the snow and ice with temperatures getting down to 12 degrees....while I shivered in my sleeping bag with every stitch of clothing I brought on.... I had thoughts of quitting. I was too cold to get my stove out and cook anything.... I had been hiking with my first group only a couple days and they just prepared some hot soup and gave it to me.... I’ll never forget that moment. It was their kindness and thoughts of the children that I was hiking for that got me through that night. That was the only time the thought of failure would enter my mind.
The days became weeks and the weeks became months.... We had awesome weather and we had terrible weather. We had climbs that sometimes that were so difficult that you would barely move one foot past the other...the death hike! We had downhills that pounded away at your knees for miles and the rocks!!! We had fantastic views and times when you couldn’t see anything. But, the people were unbelievable! The best part of the trail was always the people.... so kind, so honest, and so helpful. It didn’t matter what age you were. We were all family! There are so many people I could name here but you know who you are.... Thank you, I will always remember with such kindness.
Unfortunately for me, due to injury, I fell a little short. When it was time to walk away, I thank God that I was provided a way out in an area that is very difficult to get out of when injured. I will return to the trail in April/May of 2015 to continue as a section hiker. It stings a little not to be a thru-hiker anymore but I will finish the trail and I’ll be in awesome company just the same. The feet are 90% back as are the knees and the ribs have healed well..... I’m ready for more.
In closing we raised over 11 thousand dollars to help children with autism through the Brent Woodall Foundation in Dallas TX..... I’m very proud to have been a part of that and thank all of you that stepped up to make a difference. Count the blessing in your lives...sometimes it’s easy to forget how fortunate we are!!!
p.s. I will continue with my journal as I section hike the rest of the AT.... I hope you will continue to follow me along... I loved your comments....Thank You!
With Love,
Chris...... Tank : )","

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/490588,"In March 2014 I stepped onto the Appalachian Trail with 2 goals. 1) To raise money for a wonderful non-profit organization and 2) to realize a life long dream and complete the AT. With the help of many friends and strangers, I reached one goal. We raised over $11,000 for the Brent Woodall Foundation for Exceptional Children. After hiking over 1,000 miles, injuries stopped me from completing my second goal. I wont let that stop me, I will continue my hike beginning 04/25/2015. I plan to complete approximately 400 miles before I have to return to work and hopefully the remaining distance in 2016. Please continue to follow me on my journey.

I got thru the Whites and almost the Presidentials with perfect weather, my guide/hiker/friend Ethan said it doesn't get any better than that!!

The Cog train was making it's hourly trek up to the top with loads of people gawking at the animals in hiking gear sweating their way to the top...Do Not Feed The Hikers (animals). A quick side story, My wife and I visited here almost 20 years ago, did the cog tourist thing. When we walked into the summit snack bar I saw this dirty bearded guy with a pack and a bad smell standing next to the door. I commented to my wife, ""Why would a bum come all this way??"" LOL... Now I am that bum. If I had known he was a thru hiker I would have bought him a meal!!! Pics today.... The summit of Mt. Washington.... The snack bar where the current bum stood... The Cog train...

With the bad weather forecast today we thought a really early start would be a good choice, So we skipped breakfast and were on the trail by 6:30. We stepped out into moderate rain and possible thunderstorms for later in the day. Fog and clouds were rolling across the mountain tops so we had occasion visibility.... but still had to hike cairn to cairn. The worst part was the winds. We hiked thru 70 mph wind gusts, We were even knocked to the ground by a microburst once. Wee were up and moving then both of us were down hard, unbelievable. I've never experienced anything like it before. Several times we just made a tripod stance and tried to ride out the wind gusts until it was almost safe to move again. We rolled in about noon and quite relieved to be able to tell the tale! Tomorrow will be better weather but still could be challenging. No pics today since I had to keep everything buried in my pack to keep it dry, just one of the hut. They look nice but are cold and only provide the bare essentials. No heat, no electricity, no phone service, no showers, just ice cold water. Dinner and breakfast are the same at all huts with minor variations. I'm ready to move on from the hut system. So thankful for my Trail Angel and making it safely thru the Whites and Presidentials. Tomorrow afternoon Ethan and I part company as he heads home to a hot shower and clean clothes. My blog tonight was interrupted by the dinner bell and I have to mention the very proper couple from New England that were aghast and the lack of table manors in the hut. It was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. They are bunking above us... They are in for a treat tonight... LOL.","

What a day.... Expected another awful day but it was beautiful... I woke up at 5am to blue sky's above and an undercast in the mountain valleys... I have experienced all that the Whites/Presidentials had to offer. I forgot to mention that I even got to hike across the Jefferson snowfield, still there in June. It was slick and scary as it could be! I'm actually glad I got to experience the terrible weather conditions I hiked in yesterday. I never want to do it again... but I did it! Today we started hiking up right out of the hut on a bolder field, very tricky to navigate. It was so beautiful to look down into the valleys and see clouds, hiking down into them was surreal... The descent today was tough, as most are, but for this one we had to drop 3000 ft in 2.5 miles. Steep/Slow and as always... dangerous. My knees were quite sore by the time we got to the lodge. I'm hoping to bounce back overnight since I plan to hit the trail right after breakfast. I'm solo again but so thankful as I have said before to have had a personal guide thru the mountains of NH. I got a shower today and did my laundry. I lightened my pack again to get ready for my run thru Maine. Won't need all that winter gear now so it's heading home! I dropped 5 lbs off my pack weight. That doesn't sound like much but it's weight off the knees and helps with the climbs. Pics today....a beautiful view of Mt. Madison and some trail magic from the laundry place.","

Carter Notch Hut... 7 mi
Last hut in the hut system... thunderstorms forecast for the afternoon today and probably tomorrow too... So I decided I'd rather be soaked for 1 day rather than 2. Tomorrow I'll push for Gorham which will be a tough 15 mi. day on the rain all the way. I hope no thunderstorms. Today I had a wet climb out of Pinkham notch, hand over hand for a lot of the boulder climbing. I was pretty wet from the clouds rolling thru. The descent was 1000 ft in only 6/10 of a mile... that is fast and steep! And that always means a nasty climb out in the morning. I thought the hard part was supposed to be over!! The pic today...a look back at Pinkham Notch before it all closed in. When I checked in they told me I was the only guest tonight and wanted to cook dinner to my liking....cool. Strange at the same time. I'll make the best of it....

Gorham NH... 15 mi.
I left the hut at 5:45 this morning for a tough hike but I needed to make Gorham because the weather moved in. I almost made it... got caught by a thunderstorm about 4 hrs out. It's just water. I've decided to take a zero here. I haven't had one since before the whites and I need one. My feet and knees have taken a beating and need a rest. On Wednesday I'll make my push into Maine, finally and see what challenges await. Hopefully the weather will have moved off and I'll get a good start. Couple pics today. Trail descent.. Steep as usual. Another beautiful view before the weather. I'm glad the Wildcats and the Carter's are behind me now. Hello Maine !!","

The hike on the trail today was 12 mi... getting to the trail was another 4 mi. I couldn't get a ride hitching so I had to walk the extra 4. I've had great luck hitching but not this morning, maybe it was to early. The trail today had more exposed roots than rocks which made the hike very technical for foot placement. I didn't get the result I was hoping for from my zero. I felt very lethargic on the trail, no strength. We will see what tomorrow brings. I did pull a tick off a few weeks ago. I don't believe it was on long enough to cause an issue, it didn't have time to fill up. Anyway, passed a few southbound hikers heading to Ga. Glad I'm not them! They all looked so fresh and clean charging south, while my feet and knees remind me with every step that I still have 246 miles to go.... I'm not hiking the last 40 miles since I've already hiked those, but I will hike Katahdin again since I'll be there. Last time was in the rain and this time I'll feel like I deserve to be there!!! And I'd like to do it in good weather. Today's pics are of Page Pond about half way thru today's hike. The other is the view looking out from the shelter! Tomorrow looks like another long day, it has Mahoosuc notch in it. It's the longest 1 mile on the trail. I've heard up to 4 hrs to get thru it.","

Well, I'm finally in Maine! Did 10 hard miles today...I wanted to get thru Mahoosuc today (the hardest mi on the AT) but I also wanted to have fresh legs when I did it since I've no idea what to expect. I held up 1.5 mi short. In the morning I'll be ready! I Hiked today with a nice young man who returned to the trail today to finish his hike. He got Lyme disease and had to end his hike in NH last year... this is day 1 so he is struggling. We will do the Mahoosuc notch together then he will go off trail for resupply and I'll move on. My resupply is in Rangeley 2 days later. The pics today are crossing into Maine and the other showing hand holds in the rocks... sometimes you just need a little help. 236 mi left!!!
…… Well, when Andy showed up at the shelter before the notch he was feeling better so l packed my bag and of we went. We knew he didn't have legs for the shelter after the notch so we planned to set up camp right after we got thru the Mahoosuc boulder field.... IT WAS TOUGH. We went over under thru just like they said we would. Some places we pushed or pulled our packs thru ahead or behind us, It took us two hours to go 1 mile. You would have to do it to believe it... crazy insane! I'm wiped out, my tent is up... Goodnight!!!


06/23/2017 - Baldpate Shelter... 10 mi.
Stealth camping after doing the Mahoosuc notch seemed like a good idea at the time. It poured rain all night, everything is soaked. Ever try to sleep in a wet sleeping bag? It's awful! It rained most of the morning before stopping, everything is still wet. My legs are spent so only 10 mi today and it's supposed to rain tonight. I think l can still make Rangeley in two days for my resupply. I'm running out of food but I'll eat less… it's not like I need it for anything!!! Heather thank you for the cookies, they are awesome.
I'm in the shelter and it's filling up tonight… planning for bad weather. At the moment I'm missing my solitude!!!
06/24/17 - Hall Mountain Shelter...14 mi.
It poured again last night and well into the morning. At least l was in a shelter for the night. I did my best to protect everything before I pushed out into the rain. Today the trail threw everything it had at me all day long. I slogged along and at 6 pm rolled in. Endless bogs, rain, wet rock faces, rocks, roots… it is slow going in southern Maine. Again bad weather so the camera was packed tight.... I took a couple pics at the shelter... The first is of the shelter, and the second is my first time using my medical kit. I tried to sit on a rock for a snack. When I sat down my pack weight pulled me over and I fell off the rock... a root took a slice at me. Nothing fatal.


06/25/2017 - Bemis Shelter.... 13 mi
Solo again today, lots of mud and it’s starting to take a toll on my feet. Blisters are starting to form... my feet have been wet to long. I need to get into Rangeley to take care of my feet but 18 mi thru this kind of trail will be too much. It’s going to be 2 more days. Pushing my goal of July 15 to the limit... l don't know. Pics... couple views and the trail. Goodnight.



06/26/2017 - Sabbath Day Shelter....8 mi.
The weather was nice today so I took a short hike and stopped early to dry out all my wet gear. I’ll make Rangeley tomorrow... probably in the rain but I'll be inside at night and I'll have real food again. The southbound hikers are flooding by everyday now and filling the shelters... it's nice to meet as many as I can. They are all different in their own ways... all full of stories and goals. It's fun to hear them. They all have many questions about what's coming... I tell them all to go home now...LOL. Not really, many have already left the trail just like those heading north do. All kinds of issues... I'm getting more anxious each day for myself. I will zero in Rangeley to get ready for my push to Monson, gateway to the 100 mile wilderness. Pics today, a beautiful setting of lakes and the rain clouds that plaque me almost daily. The other… LOL my feet after a day of bogs soaking thru my boots!!!


06/27/2017 - Rangeley......10 mi.
Up early and on the trail at 6am, expected rain but it turned out they were wrong... Beautiful hike average 2.5 mph...I was flying. I got into Rangeley at 11 am after a 12 mi hitch. Got my food resupply and checked in to the Rangeley Inn where I will enjoy a zero tomorrow. I wanted to mention that if you are interested in pics of Mahoosuc Notch, google it to see better pics than I could ever get. It's worth the effort. Since I expected rain I didn't have my camera so all I have is where I'm staying tonight. Back on the trail Thursday.","

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570942,"06/29/2017 - Spaulding Shelter - 18.7 mi
You can't predict mother nature. I left Rangeley at 6am and the plan was 10 mi before the rain started. When I got to the first shelter at 1:30 and no rain l decided to push for the next shelter and see if l could best the rain again. l got rained on a little but nothing that caused any issues. I can't believe I did 18.7 it almost made up for my zero. Tomorrow’s next shelter is again 18.6 mi which I am not doing. I will overnight in Stratton and get back on the trail in morning. It's still about a 14 mile day and I'll be inside dry. Overall it was a good day, but hard on my feet again. Still passing south bounders but thinning out. Only a few hundred start north and go south. I haven't seen any northbound hikers for a few days...they are out there! Pic today was me on a peak freezing, tomorrow will be warmer.

06/30/2017 - Stratton - 14 mi
Rain again, why not!!! I’m soaked again from the morning hike. The rain let off as the day progressed but thunderstorms are in the forecast with flash flooding in mountain areas. There was a warning for hikers so I hiked 14 mi and hitched into Stratton for the night. I’ll probably zero tomorrow and have to make it up. I’m still seeing south bounders each day. It's nice to be dry even though it's only a temporary reprieve. Getting closer in spite of the rain. I think I'm at about 150 miles to go. I passed the 2000 mile mark today. I'm in the club! No pics again acct weather.... I had a fellow hiker take this pic as he passed thru Wadleigh shelter in the 100 mile wilderness.... Still there!!

07/02/2017 - Little Bigelow Shelter - 15.5 mi
I'm glad I stayed in Stratton for the weather... it poured !!! One mi into my hike I had a ford in front of me, normally a rock hop but with the storm no way. I saw a tree across the stream about 20 yards downstream so I went for it, and I made it. Beats pulling off shoes n socks... unless you fall in! It was a beautiful day to hike. The trail was horrible but the sun was out and the temp was perfect! As usual the mileage ate up my feet. Tomorrow I may do 18 since my feet hurt so much today. that will put me in position for the ferry across a river that you must not ford!!! And a chocolate shake the next day in town....YUM. Today I climbed my last mountain over 4,000 ft. until Katahdin....Yahoo !!! The pics are views today... I'm getting there....a little closer each day now....I'm starting to feel it....



07/03/2017 - Pierce Pond Shelter - 20.1 mi
18.1 is the actual trail mileage... The other 2 mi is because I missed a turn and had to backtrack....dang it! That is the worst feeling. Anyway, I'm in position for the ferry ride tomorrow morning. I have 3.5 mi to hike to the Kennebec River for my ferry ride. After that I'm diving into a chocolate milk shake!! Then back on the trail. I'm 3 days out of Monson. Then into the 100 mile wilderness. Still planning on a summit of Mt Katahdin on the 15th. You will never guess in a million years what I saw on the trail yesterday. Moms trail name is Kanga and the 16 month old baby she is carrying is Roo. Dads trail name is Sherpa because he is carrying everything, and I mean everything !!! Amazing !!! Today I slogged along in a minimum of 5 miles of bogs...awful ! I can smell my shoes from here and they are 10 ft away.
I saw another 2000 mile sign so here it is. The other pic is a mushroom I saw as I hiked. I'm not sure if I had a flashback or not! And the other is roots on the trail....try to hike over these for mile after mile....lotto fun!



07/04/2017 - Pleasant Pond Shelter - 10 mi
Up early and headed for the ferry.... I arrived at 8:15 for a 9am ride....I'm always early. Short n sweet...then on my way to that chocolate shake....Yum. After that I headed to then next shelter and plans for the one after that.... Guess what...Rain again! Forecast for partly cloudy....lol it's been raining for 6 hrs now ! So I'm stuck at 10 mi today with 8 other hikers in a 6 person shelter. Ughhhh. Tomorrow I'll head north while the rest head south. The pics today....the view from the shelter when I woke. A waterfall .... A good example of a Maine hiker bridge.... My ferry operator and notice the blaze in the canoe...it's the official AT route.... I'm cold...wet, again! And I don't like being a sardine !! Come on sleep....sweet relief !!!","

Ok....I'm just 18 mi from Monson so I'll be there tomorrow afternoon...I'll probably do a zero to just enjoy the moment. I'm ready to finish the hike but at the same time wishing for more... melancholy moments. The shelters are full of southbound hikers night now... I wish them well. I'm on track to summit earlier than I planned... only by a day maybe two depending on weather of course. Rain In the forecast for tomorrow but I'm going regardless... why not? I expect to have a few fords tomorrow, some tough with all the rain, and a bunch more in the 100. The pics today are of: Yuk, who has entertained many hikers, he is traveling on a tight budget so after he entertained me and another hiker I kicked into the budget for his hike, nice guy. The other is me enjoying the view on top of Moxie Bald....really beautiful!!!

07/06/2017 - Monson .. Lakeshore Inn - 18.0
What was supposed to be another wet day turned out to be beautiful, can't say the same for the trail...lol. My boots are rotting off my feet now. If I stand on a wet rock, my socks soak up the water!! They are coming apart everywhere, mostly from rot! I'm sure I'll get another week out of them... I have duct tape. I'm so glad to be in a warm dry place where I can have real food brought to me. This is the last stop before Katahdin. If the weather cooperates I'll be out of here Saturday morning. I've done my resupply and cleaned myself up to a near normal state… didn't have any Borax !! My run thru the wilderness will take about 6 days if all goes well. Then I'll rest a day before I summit Katahdin.Seems surreal to be near the end of a journey! A dream my wonderful wife supported. She took on sooooo much just to let me go for a walk in the woods.
The pic was just a shelter I had lunch at today during my 18 mile hike to get here. As most of you know, I hiked alone most of this hike. I actually came to enjoy the time alone and looked forward to the social aspects of the shelter or campsites during the evenings. A simple picture but it moves me deeply.
The final moments of this hike will do the same when I reach that sign. I did the work and the end of this journey will be bittersweet!

07/07/2017 - Ready Set Go !!!
I've enjoyed my zero in Monson but, it's time to move. The weather forecast is rain next four outta five days....of course it is!! Monson has been really nice and they appreciate the hikers. My hitch-in took 1 car and he was going in the opposite direction... really! The Lake Shore House is a converted home to a nice hostel with a restaurant and a pub. The town folks have been so nice. I've seen a few hikers I've met along the way come and go. I'm ready to go. As nice as it is, it isn't home! I have heard there is trail magic 14 miles into the 100, sounds like a great place for a stop!! It's a full blown hiker feast for 3 days, a local has a cabin there and does this each year....finally some real trail magic....lol. The pic is out my window at the hostel....temp has been in the 70s.....can't wait to melt in Texas!!","

I got off to a good start today, had breakfast at 6am and was on the trail at 7am with sunshine!! By 9 am I was in the rain and for the last 3 mi to the shelter, heavy rain w/ thunder. In spite of being soaked again, the trail magic was good as expected!! Cheeseburgers, hot dogs, and sodas. Anyway, I'm in the 100 and will be on Katahdin by the 13/14 ish. I don't know why I thought this section would be any easier. I did and it isn't! So, one foot In front of the other until I'm done, rain or shine!! The pics are a nice warning sign for the 100 and a lake view I liked before the rains came.


7/9/2017 - Pleasant River (ford) 15 mi.
Pretty good day today....only got rained on for 30 min. I forgot to mention a couple days ago that an AT hiker got rescued from the trail after he fell on a steep decline and broke his leg. He was a day ahead of us at the time. Even this close disaster is still just 1 step away. Tonight I am camped on the bank of my next ford. I'll cross the river in the morning and then I'll work on a seven mile climb over Whitecap Mt, the last big effort before I summit. I'm down to 4 hiking days then a summit climb. Hard to believe after all it's taken to get here. Pics today of you know who....with calves that will deflect bullets. And the other is my hubble for the night.","

Pretty nice hiking today. There was a very fine misty rain in morning but it gave way to sunshine. It was one foot in front of the other... up and over the last 4 remaining mountains. After that... all downhill to the shelter. My feet are hurting pretty good these days. I think it's my boots that are just not able to support my feet anymore since they are crumbling to pieces. The fix in Monson lasted about 4 hrs. The soles have worn down so thin I feel every rock. They will get me up and over Katahdin. I didn't take any pics today... sorry I'm getting lazy. I would have taken a pic of the stone Dalmatian on this side of White Cap but I missed it. I did see other pics of it, pretty cool to see in the woods. This is my last night in a shelter. The next two nights will be at campsites to get me in position to get to Katahdin. I'll try to take some pics tomorrow. Good Night.

Today was the most beautiful day to hike I have had... so the miles. Tomorrow I'll get into a hostel and wait on the weather to summit. It's supposed to rain again but we will see. I'm ready for this journey to come to a close. It is a dream realized... not like I planned but none the less! Thank you to all of you who supported the cause, were kind in your comments, and always encouraged me. My plan is to hike Katahdin on Friday. Rain is in the forecast for Thursday and Saturday. So if I can get all my ducks in a row tomorrow... Friday is the day. I will have my GPS on tracker all day so if you are interested in seeing my track up and back down Katahdin, check out the live map. It'll be slow... haha. I'll update more tomorrow....

Probably didn't look like that with the tracker but I hauled. Next time I saw the other seven hikers who were all southbounders I was on my way back down. They were on their way up...huffing and puffing on day 1 for them. When I approached the summit I didn't think I would lose it but after I asked another hiker to take pics of my moment,,,, I lost it !! There was about 20 people there and my sobbing got everyones attention...and after I did my thing on the sign I actually got an applause from the group...which didn't help my blubbering at all.... I took about half an hr to sit and reflect...answered some questions and just regained myself. The hike back down was quiet for me and passed quickly.
