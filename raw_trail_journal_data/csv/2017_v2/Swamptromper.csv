Swamptromper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554767,"After section hiking for several years I have completed from Amicalola to Dalesville. My generous sweet husband has relented and is encouraging me to FINISH. I will start from Dalesville on April 14 and doggedly head to Katahdin. No one has ever accused me of being fast, just determined. My longest section was 300 miles, so I have some idea what to expect. my gear is pretty much sorted out, though I have not decided whether to bring my stove (alcohol) or go cold. I've carried stove and fuel a hundred miles or more without using it more than once, so I'm leaning toward cold.Just bought my first smart phone so that I can check the weather and text home (I had a really really stupid phone). I became Swamptromper because of all the time I spend slogging in South Florida maintaining the Florida Trail. I considered changing that to the caning lady, since my life has brought me new ""occupation"" to keep me out of the poorhouse during retirement. I restore/repair all kinds of woven seats; sort of like basket weaving. A customer once said it was a hybrid of OCD and Zen. I agree. Hiking is kinda like that too.
""Swamptromper"" came from a dear friend who is no longer with us; my respect for him kept me from changing that, so Swamptromper I will remain.",,Gonna Finish!,"Feb 17, Fri",0
Swamptromper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554825,"I've decided to use a few maildrops so send meds, personal items, freeze dried veggies, and my cold coffee blend - 1 part chocolate boost powder + 2 parts whole powdered milk + 3 parts instant coffee. The rest will come as it comes along the trail and can't be planned. I'm a ""Keep Australia on Your Left "" kind of person anyway, so too much planning gives me a headache.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Tue",0
Swamptromper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557018,"Time is flying. I still have lots of work to finish beforeI leave, and most of my time is being spent on that. I have not even started to pack anything yet, but I think that I have most of what I'll need. Back to work... caning is just a continuous over under over under over under...today it's a porch rocker.",,still working,"Mar 20, Mon",0
Swamptromper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557717,"Leaving my husband, JV & grand kids and critters for four months will be a test for me-especially Jaxson,my 65# catahoula/cattle dog mix . He's a big doofus who is a momma's boy. Soft collar didn't work too well for him, he destroyed it in a day!
I'm getting close to prepared... 7 resupply boxes packed and ready to go. Have said good bye to many of my friends. 6 more chairs to finish and I will be all set!",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Sun",0
