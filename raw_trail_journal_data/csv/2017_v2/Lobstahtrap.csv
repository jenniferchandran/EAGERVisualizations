Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611204,Started by quest to walk the PA AT NOBO. I've been doing a little backpacking here and there over the past couple of summers. Love it. Just wish I had time for more. The temps never warmed up. Started out mid day around 35 degrees and windy. Got to Tumbling Run Shelters just before dark. Gathered wood for a fire. Not near enough available. Getting every scrappy branch possible. Thermometer on shelter shows it to be about 20 degrees. Headed to bed around 7 because the fire is out and it is soooo cold.,"PenMar (Pennsylvania Maryland border)

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611205,"Rough night sleeping last night. Wasn't expecting temps to drop that much. About 15 degrees when I got up. Got a fire going with some leftover wood, ate a hot breakfast, drank coffee and hit the trail. The start was an immediate ascent. After that it was it pretty much leveled off and we walked the ridge line for a bit of the second half of the day. Got to the car around 2pm. Decided not to push further because it was so cold. Didn't pack for sub 25 degrees. I'm hooked though and am going to challenge myself to complete the entire PA AT for 2018. Time to get some lighter equipment in the meantime. That 8lb Marine Corp pack is too heavy!","Tumbling Run Shelter

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611209,"I had a day to hike so I decided to takle the PA AT where I left off in November. My drive to Pine Grove Furnace SP was over 2.5 hours. Halfway there I realized I forgot my trekking poles. Got a ride to Caledonia from Trail of Hope Hostel and Shuttle. Temps in the mid 30s for most of the day. With only a day pack I breezed through the first 15 miles at over a 3 mph clip. There wasn't much to see in terms of views. At some point on the downhill prior to Tom's Run Shelter my left knee started acting up from the stress of a bunch of things - cruising pace, sudden downhill grade and lack of conditioning. The last 5 miles turned into a barely 2 mph pace on terrain that should have been much faster. Got to the car in so much pain. To make matters worse, everything around Pine Grove Furnace SP was closed - specifically the museum and general store. It appears it doesn't open until late April. This knee is a mess.","Route 30 / Caledonia SP, PA

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611234,"Well, after a steroid to relieve the pain in my left knee from the last hike, I'm back at it. Left from Pine Grove Furnace around 11am. Felt good until 4 miles in - then the knee blew up again. I didn't intend to walk to Whiskey Spring today but pushed because I'm not sure if my knee will move tomorrow. The going was slow - very slow. I've got to keep pushing though. My car is parked at Boiling Springs. I am tenting 20 yards off the trail just up the hill after crossing Whiskey Spring Road. Fun fact - this is the point where the Mason Dixon Trail ends (or begins). The other end is in Wilmington, Delaware, where I live. I'll have to tackle that trail once I finish the PA AT.","Pine Grove Furnace SP, PA

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611237,I definitely had to grin and bear to finish this 6 mile section. There were a lot of day hikers out today. Chatted with a few. Met thru hikers Scratch and Funsize on the trail. I thought it was interesting to finish up this part of the trail by walking across farms. It is funny to see a single first-born path going across a field. I think this may be the end of my hiking for 2018. My knee is a wreck and I need to get it figured out. I have a feeling that PT and rest are in order. Really hoping there isnt a tear. Until then...,"Whiskey Spring Road

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611239,"I'm back! No surgery. Just PT, rest and a desire to get back on the trail. The trail was flat for the first 12 miles. The last 2 miles were pretty much straight up hill. Wicked tired. I definitely don't have hiking legs right now. Camped with flip-floppers Lightfoot(Michigan), Pinky (San Antonio), Spanish Coconut -wish I could remember the translation (also San Antonio). Also camped with 22 (don't recall where is from). He is banging out 100 mile sections dedicated to the memory of U.S. service members that have taken there lives due to the effects of PTS. There were a couple other section hikers - just forget their trail names. It was a great way to finish my first day back on trail.","Boiling Springs, PA

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611243,"Definitely feel the previous days hike today in my calves. I'm annoyed because I bruised the outside of my right foot too. Arrived to the town of Duncannon around 1pm. You have to walk through the entire town to get to the other side of the river to continue on the AT. What a sad town. Nothing but a gas station was open. Yes, it was Easter but the town didn't seem like it would very welcoming to hikers - maybe things change as the season gets going. Was planning to tent at Clarks Ferry Shelter. The only tenting there is at the Boy Scout camp about 2 tenths of a mile before the shelter. That campsite doesn't have access to the spring or privy tho. Not sure if it had a bear box either. Stayed the night at the shelter with Lightfoot. The air aas a wee bit chilly.","Darlington Shelter

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611244,Today was the last day of this part of the backpacking trip. Had a lot of fun. Got to the parking area off PA 225 in the morning. I wanted to carry on to PA 325 but was concerned I might not be able to get a ride back to my car in Duncannon because I would be arriving late afternoon. There were a couple cars in the lot but as luck would have it an Uber driver was available too. For $25 I got back to Duncannon right quick. This will be the spot I leave from the next time I get back on the trail as I continue my quest to complete the PA AT NB. Until then...,"Clarks Ferry Shelter

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624302,Drove up from Wilmington late to take Annie (10 yrs old) on her first backpacking trip - Bonus is that it is on the AT. Tent site and a nice grandfather and his older grandson. Pleasant conversation. Downside was that 6-8 local YahHoos were in the shelter. Scared the shit out of us when they started shooting a flare gun 3-5 times at random. Lots of drinking and weed. Didn't help that they had a handgun laying about under those conditions. Temps got down to 32. The spring was about a trickle. Used siringeÂ  to get the water.,"PA 225 Overpass

Lobstahtrap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624303,Slept in until 8. Hit the trail a little after 10 but stopped soon after to make Annie some instant mashed potatoes. Walked the ridge line the whole way until right before the decent to PA 325. Saw a few day hikers - all friendly. No wildlife. Annie did a great job carrying her pack and negotiating the PA rocks. Finished up at PA 325 hoping to get an Uber...but FYI... Verizon does not get cell service there. Luckily a nice couple was finishing up a day hike (Josh & Courtney from Harrisburg) and they offered to give us a ride back to the 225 overpass - thank God. Oh...Annie has a trail name...Midnight Blazah!,"Peter's Mountain Shelter
