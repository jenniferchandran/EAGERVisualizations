Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556049,"It's been a great week! The weather during the day has been awesome, and I made a hiker buddy, Fedex, that hikes at my pace :D She pulls me up the mountain, and I get her down.First night, had an issue with my hammock in the rain and had to sleep in the shelter. It was sooo cold! Luckily, Raid was able to give me numbers for shuttles, and four of us took a shuttle in to Neels Gap from Hightower Gap. Got myself a z-lite pad for using in the shelters. Got some more handwarmers too. I've actually been using it in the hammock too, along with my underquilt. Kept me warm down to 22!The first half of the week, temps in the morning were in the 30s, highs in the mid 50s. Second half has been warmer. Except for one night at blue mountain shelter. It was freezing, windy, raining, and 15 of us crammed ourselves into the shelter. Managed to get warm after I got up in the middle of the night to cover myself with the tarp. That made all the difference! Fedex almost went flying off the mountain in her tent with those winds. (Boo to the college kids that left their trash everywhere. Not cool)Neels gap was full by the time we got there the hiker way, so we stayed in the cabins with Shaggy. It was great. The shower was much loved!!!!!I think my favorite day so far has been the hike from Blue Mountain Shelter to Tray Mountain Shelter. The day was hard as hell, hiking wise, but the weather was great, the shelter was at the top of the mountain, and I finally managed to set up my hammock exactly how I wanted too. Stayed up until after dark for the first time to take pictures, and woke up in time to see the sunrise right outside my hammock! Beautiful.Today though, Fedex and I kicked butt on those mountains. (By the way Kelley, if you read this, look up the info on Kelly's Knob mountain. It was a nightmare of a climb, and since you share a name, I am officially considering it your payback for making you take me to the airport so early in the morning.) We got up at 5am (to the horror of not only us two, but to the other 6 people sharing the shelter) and were packed and ready to go by 6:15. Hiked 4 miles into Dick's Creek Gap in 2.5 hours!!! Record fast for us! Woohoo! Staying the night at Top of Georgia, then attempting to get to Franklin, NC by Tuesday. Crossing fingers!Also, AYCE? Hell Yessssss. Ended up getting two plates of salad. Never craved salad before. Hopefully I can get to a computer sooner next time! Off to more food, a good night's sleep, resupply, and maybe Franklin in a few days!Oh!!!!! Happy news! I got into Penn State! Now I have to look into the two school and see which one I like most. So far, Penn State is winning. Tuition and cost of living is cheaper, and it's ranked 20th in the country for my program as opposed to 39 for the other. I'd have to write a thesis though :/ But hell, I'm hiking the AT, I can write a paper....right!....right?.....maybe..... Still waiting for two more to respond before I really choose though. So very happy and excited right now :DBefore I sign off and follow the others outside the library, thank you McGyver (did I spell that right?) for the Trail magic at Gooch Gap, and Greeter and Bigfoot for the magic at Dick's Creek. Definitely made those days awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS: Congrats Goforth on the promotion! Sad to see you go, but definitely happy for you!","Springer

I've been driving him and everyone around me nuts about the AT for MONTHS. I didn't know these Trail Journals existed until a woman I've been exchanging emails with suggested a few for advice. And I love it! At least this way, I won't be bugging them so much! (I'll just be annoying all of you! Mwa-ha-ha!!!)So if anyone read my ""about me"", I'm assuming you're already aware of how incredibly awkward I am!

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519105,"Hi!!! I figured I would get this out of the way at the beginning, because I'll probably forget later.I've been dreaming about the AT for a while now, of and on for four, maybe five years? Last year I walked the Camino as a test to see if I was capable physically and mentally for something on such a large scale as the AT. I know you can't really compare the two, considering the Camino is mostly done on highways (Don't even get me started), but the walking mile after mile every day, I needed to know whether I was capable of keeping up with it or not. Because if I couldn't do it in the setting of the Camino, which afforded much more luxuries than the AT, then there was no way I was ready to even think of attempting the AT. As it turns out....my mental endurance is much much higher than my physical, (Not surprising, really, considering my size) but getting ready physically is not impossible, not if it's something that I really want.So, in light of this, I decided to make starting the AT in 2017 my goal, giving me almost two years to prepare financially and physically. Now it's finally down to a little more than a year. I honestly can't believe it. All of the research is soon going to start becoming gear purchases. I also have the good fortune to currently be living near the first mountain in the ""6-pack of peaks"" challenge. I'm hoping that in preparing for, and working through, this challenge, I will be preparing my body for what's to come. Hopefully I can find some places not too far from here to practice over night hikes later in the year when I start ordering gear.OH MY GOODNESS I'M GOING TO BE ORDERING GEAR SOON. CAN YOU TELL I'M EXCITED??????????I think I'll leave this one here, and make another entry in a couple of days talking about gear. If there's one thing I'm grateful for in the journals I've read (And believe me, there are many things I'm grateful for, you wonderful people), it's the vindication in that I'm not completely insane for wanting to talk about gear all the time. Even my boyfriend who is a complete techy that has never been camping/hiking (I popped his fishing cherry when we were juniors is high school. SUCCESS I TELL YOU! You wouldn't BELIEVE his mother's face when she found out he was actually going to go fishing), is beginning to recognize the different retailers from how often I talk about this stuff. Days like today I wish I could just time travel to a month before I want to start, just so that I don't have to wait so long! But this is going to be an eventful year and a half!!!

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519169,"This topic has become an almost obsession with me. I am constantly googling different things, comparing weights, finding reviews to see the actual weights, deciding on something, and then changing my mind five minutes later. There are a few, though, that I can honestly say have remained stable these last few months. Hopefully when I start buying/testing them, they'll be what I stick with, at least in the beginning! A girl can dream, right ;DThere are so many options out there! The one thing I'm quite certain about, is that I want to take a hammock system. I was initially wary due to the weight and warmth issues, but my obsessive googling has helped with both of these. On one of the forums, Sgt. Rock posted a way to get the weight of the whole thing, hammock, suspension, rain fly, and cords down to about 13oz!!! Plus, he also has a video and outline of a sub-2oz bug net. HOW AWESOME IS THAT. With the warmth, I have my new friend that I've been emailing with to thank (Not sure if you want your name here, so leaving it out just in case!) as well as ""Certain"" and the information she shared in her pre-hike entries. Mainly, just lower the hammock to the ground and make it a tent-like thing instead! Love that.The amount of advice and information people have shared so freely about all things hiking is incredible. It just makes me even more excited to get to be a part of that community in.....apparently 420 days! I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!I've also recently begun that blasted spreadsheet with all of those wonderful numbers telling me whether or not I'm over-packing. So far so good! If the numbers are adequate, then I am on my way to getting my big three to be just under 3#s. VERY EXCITED HERE PEOPLE O.oThe last thing I'm going to say for now is that I officially have my first piece of gear: Ridiculously expensive, but oh so nice, Black Diamond Trekking Poles, courtesy of my wonderful mother who gave them to me for Christmas. I could not be more thankful! I've never owned any before, so it'll be nice to start going on some hikes where I'm not going to feel like I'm destroying my poor knees!!!! Thanks for stopping by! I again apologize for my awkwardness. If it makes any of you feel better, I am even more awkward in person! :P",,Gear!,"Jan 05, Tue",0
Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519546,"This week has been......I can only refer to it as insanity. My housemate/landlady made our lives a living hell this week. There was constant slamming of doors, any doors, cabinet doors, front, side, back doors, bathroom/bedroom doors, and window thingies since our windows open inward on hinges like doors (Never lived in a place with those before). This wasn't because she was angry. Nope. It was because we were giving off negative energy and that was how she got rid of it. Needless to say, things got worse. I won't get into too much detail, except to explain the climax of all of this.So, watered down version: Three hours (12am-3am abouts) of her playing a reccording of the entire rosary on repeat, more of the typical slamming, and, finally, at the end, the stomping of booted feet so hard it shook the house in alternating speeds. It is now 3am. We left the room to ask her to stop, and before we had the chance to speak, she accused me, specifically, of being a witch that stole her sock and cursed her foot. Needless to say, we started looking for a new place to live. So, as we come to the fourth move in fourth months, I can honestly we have been given some luck and found a place we can move into in a couple of weeks. That is good news. Better news is that she also sat down and apologized for being 'rude' that night. Normally, I could get over this if it was a one-off. But it's not. That was simply the climax to a week that quickly built up to that point. At least she's back to baseline, for however long it lasts. Thank goodness. Unfortunately this means my mom will have to hold off on shipping me the trekking poles until we are settled in the new place.Some good things happened this week though! I'm so very excited to have bought my very own FOOD SCALE! Yay! I told Luis I bought one, and he couldn't figure out why I needed one, since I don't exactly weigh my food. Took a while of me giving hints about hiking before he figured it out, hahaha. Then proceeded to tell me how insane that is :D Gotta love the boyfriend. Told my cousin/godmother on the other hand, and she figured it out immediately! Fun times, fun times. I also bought a nail clipper since we needed one around the house, and it weighs only 13grams! (Target people, awesome stuff) I think I might just take it with me instead of a pocket knife. Still undecided. Also bought a go girl (Funnel thing so I can pee like a man rather than getting it on my legs and/or in my shoes) today. That's going to be fun! That, in addition to my Meluna cup should take care of those girly inconveniences! I don't know if I could handle packing out pads/tampons. Gross. So yay for no waste products! AWESOME. XDSo while the week may have been rough, I'm glad to have gotten a couple more pieces of my kit together, even if it's not much. Just makes things a little more exciting with the hike. Only 413 days to go!

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519728,"One week until moving day! Can't wait :D And 410 days until the trail!!! I keep researching gear and tips and everything (Hence the title) just to keep myself from going nuts! And also to keep from purchasing every piece of gear that I find that sounds useful. I'm working on that list/spreadsheet thing, and it's so preeetty! What I did buy though, was some rope to practice knots on (Yeah, I know. What can I say? My boyfriend did not appreciate me using charger cables.), small thing of sunblock, and the same aloe cream I used on the Camino (Which was amazing on my burns.). On the spreadsheet they go as bought!I'm really happy with my hammock system, I just hope it works out all right. It's going to be the first big purchase I make. SO EXCITED! I'm just waiting for some sales to start, and then it's testing time! Since I'm terrified of it failing as I try to use it, my boyfriend will be my guinea pig. The hammock should be good up to 300lbs, so I trust that with my weight no problem. But the suspension? Not so much. Slings and straps, I know work, but the soft shackles....worried, honestly.

It's also Luis's birthday, SO ONE OF US CAN FINALLY RENT A STUPID CAR YES. Which is good, because he may have to rent one, hahaha. I really hope this is the last time we have to move for a good while. And then! Off on a job hunt! I should have my trekking poles come in about two weeks, which is great! I can't wait until I get to hike some of the trails near here. Have I mentioned how nice it is to live somewhere where there are actual hills????? I love Miami, always will, but that one hill that they built in the park with the dirt they dug up to make the lake is only so tall. :D Really looking forward to putting my hydration pack to use!!! Questions for anyone out there: Have any of you used muletape with a hammock system before? What kind of longevity did you get out of them? How often do they have to be replaced?Thanks for reading!

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520865,"Hi guys!!! It's been a while :D It's been a pretty crazy couple weeks. We finally moved into (what will hopefully be the last until June) the apartment, I got to visit my family this week, and my trekking poles finally made it to Pasadena  I've looked into a bunch of trails that I can start training on, and a couple of campsites I can use that don't have amenities to get some shake-downs done. So so ready to start! Luis is still....um...not so very excited, but at least he's coming around on my having to go out to the mountains to train. THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION YES. I'm so happy and lucky to have my family supporting me. There is no way I'd be able to do this otherwise. They also asked me what I wanted for my birthday, then decided to just get me stuff for hiking. They gave me instructions on how to give them a list of what I wanted (i.e. it had to have the exact name with details, and a link to follow, etc...). Of course, then I told them I have already been doing that, so they proceeded to nag me for several days straight until I'd sent them the spreadsheet, hahaha. Another thing that happened was that Cheri was awesome, again, and shared some info that she learned from people that had thru-hiked before, and I shared with her my love of spam! (I'm going to pretend that was a fair trade of information, even though it clearly wasn't - Shhh!) Oh! And I found a cap in a box in my room that is mostly mesh on the top for ventilation, so YAY WITH FINDING FREE GEAR!!! And my dad took my sister and I to Outdoor World (AKA Bass Pro Shops. My dad always referred to it as Outdoor World. I was 14 when I realized it was actually named something else. Love you daddy!), where she proceeded to buy a gun cleaning kit, and I bought a colorful buff that has enough orange to not confuse me with a wild animal (I hope!). I'm looking forward to getting all the gear I already have together and weighing them. Don't have anything big, but I have a lot of the little things, sunblock, rash cream, aloe cream, antibiotic cream, go girl, meluna cup (Like a Diva cup), buff, and cap. I know, I know, why so much cream, but it's all necessary for me. Everywhere I've read on the what to pack blogs/videos/sites/etc is to down size where you can, take only what you need, recheck to make sure you really need it, and make sure to find a balance that works for you. And that's what I'm going to do. As for the go girl, I'm aware it's not necessary, by any means, and it's going anyways. It's the one 'luxury' item I'm allowing myself.The buff is exciting though! SOOO MANY USEEEES! I was naming them all to my mother, who of course asked me if I was showing her the buff or making an infomercial. What can I say? Training officially starts this week! Everything's coming together!!!!! Less than 13months to go XD (Don't have my count down. It's on my laptop back home)",,Family Rocks,"Feb 08, Mon",0
Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520969,"Guys!!!!! I officially start my hiking training tomorrow! I've been walking with a weighted backpack around town and stuff, but actual hiking is happening tomorrow! Yes!Add to that that the jacket my aunt bought for my birthday will get here on Friday, and my hammock (Thanks momma!) gets here early next week, and I find myself overloaded with excitement! Next year couldn't come any sooner :DNow I just have to load my hydration pack with a bunch of stuff to get some weight in. Luckily, the bladder is large (3 Liters), which, when full, automatically gives me 6.6 pounds. With a sandwich for lunch, sunscreen, and swimming stuff, I should be able to add a couple more pounds. If there's any space left, I think I'll add little ziplocks filled with rice. I want to get it up to 10 or 12 pounds, which is how much I normally carry around town, just with a more compact bag. (My around town bag is a laptop backpack from swiss army that weighs almost 5 pounds empty. It's a heavy monstrosity, but it sure makes everyday training reeeeeaallly convenient!!!!! ;PAnother good thing is that the weather is heating up quickly, so the hike will be in some uncomfortably hot weather. Staying hydrated has always been tough for me, so I need to work on drinking water regularly on a hike, make it a habit. I'm worried that once it's colder, if it isn't a habit, I'm going to go too long without water and end up hurting myself. This hike is short and easy (3.8 miles - out and back, only 500ft elevation, and the trail is wide enough for strollers). Only 384 days to go!

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521014,"Starting with the stats!Miles walked to and from trail head: 2Trail length: 3.8Total miles traveled: 5.8Me and my lazy behind ended up not only NOT packing last night, but also sleeping until 8 instead of the intended 6:30. Between getting ready, grabbing lunch to go from Subways, and the bus/walk to the trail head, I didn't start hiking until 10, just in time for the morning chill to go away! Not the best start, but I think it worked out for the best. The first 1.4 miles of the trail is easy, with the normal ups and downs found in states other than Miami. (It took me a while to get used to everything not being perfectly flat. Other than that one hill in the park, if you want a 'mountain', you'll need to visit Mt. Trashmore.) During this part, there was a tree whose branches and leaves created a dome around it. It had obviously been used as a paintball hold, because there was evidence of a standoff on the trunk. It couldn't have been more than half a mile from the trail head, but I couldn't help myself and decided to climb it. I haven't climbed a tree in a long time! It was kinda fun (In a nerdy kind of way, but I'm a nerd, so woohoo!!)It's at that 1/2 miles left sign they have posted on the trail where things get fun. Creek crossings, rock scrambling, and a modicum of shade! (I'm happy to say that I only became slightly burnt, so the deodorant looking sun block worked!) I really liked crossing the creeks. It was like a detective game where you had to find the driest way across, hahaha. There was a moment after the trickiest rock scrambling on the trail where you get to the top, look to the other end of the canyon, and see the falls. It was so encouraging!!!After taking pictures and eating lunch, I took off my shoes and dipped my feet in the water. It was so cold, and so nice on my heated skin!!!! I love fresh running water. I must say though, I was really upset when I noticed that one section of the canyon seemed to be the designated trash corner. LNT is important. On the way back I had to laugh. Some poor sap was walking with his girlfriend. He didn't carry a pack of any kind, but what he /did/ carry was a one gallon bottle of water in his hand. I don't know how long he lasted with it. I wouldn't have gone very far before the protesting of my fingers on the very thin strap would have had me chucking it in the first trash can I saw. (Too bad the only bins were at the trail head). Many good things from this! First:I'm really happy with my mileage today. I want to be able to hike an average of 8 miles for the first ten days, so I'm happy that I was close to that even though the trail itself wasn't anywhere near as rigorous, nor was my pack as heavy, but I think it was a good start. Second:I drank all three liters of water. Between the walk from the bus stop, the hike, the break, and the walk back, I just finished when the bus stop was in sight. SO YAY NO HEAT STROKE FOR ME! And Last but Not Least!:The trekking poles, although extremely awkward for me at first, help up beautifully. I know for a fact I would have fallen into several creeks without them. They also made scrambling so much easier. I felt much more secure in my footing.I'm hoping to go again on Monday before trying out a new trail on Wednesday. The trail on Wednesday is longer by about a mile as well as a bit more difficult, but not too much more. I want to push myself, but not overexert myself. The last thing I want is an injury to put a stop to the trail next year. I'm also going to spend the rest of the week doing knee strengthening exercises and stairs. That's all for now! Let's see how the rest of the week plays out!!! :DONLY 383 MORE DAYS TO GOSN: My REI Down Jacket came in early, my hammock might get here early as well, and my dad is going to get me the suspension for it!!!!!!!!!!!!

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522156,"Hi everyone!!!!!So, weekend before last, I had planned to go on a long (for me) hike, but it turned out the trail I wanted to try was too far away to get to. Maybe if I had a car, it would have been doable, but I have no car here, so public transportation is the only way for me. That same week, the muletape my dad ordered for me arrived, so that, together with my hammock, gave me the idea to go to a nearby longer trail, split it in two, and try an overnight hike. It was....interesting. Day 1: 4 miles - Chantry Flat to Spruce Grove Campground.I'd wanted to hike further, 7.5miles, but I didn't get to the trailhead until 12pm. I got to the campground at 3 and needed a good break. At about 4/5 I was more than ready to keep hiking, but there was no way that I was going to make it another 3.5 miles before dark. I wasn't well prepared for the nighttime cold. I stupidly left my puffy jacket and extra pair of socks on the coffee table at home. Thankfully, my sleeping bag was enough to get me through the night, just not enough for me to be able to sleep. I definitely won't be overnighting again until I have a sleeping pad. Still, it wasn't so bad. I packed enough food and water, so I wasn't hungry nor thirsty, and there were some pretty views.Day 2: 4 miles - Back the same way, + 3.5 mile walk on roadMuch better, time-wise. I packed up 'camp' as soon as the sun started to rise, and I was out in under 10 minutes. I waited until I'd warmed up a bit with the hike, as well as until I didn't need the flashlight to see anymore, to eat breakfast. The way back took much less time, probably because the only real uphill point was the last .6 miles, which was pretty steep compared to the rest of the trail's gradual change. According to the internet, the total elevation gain from Chantry Flat to the campground was about 800ft, nothing major, but I wonder what that initial dip into the canyon is.Here's where day 2 went.....a little different. I had to take a taxi to get to the trailhead, because although the mountains are just one town over, there is no bus that will take me there, not like the Eaton Canyon trailhead that was about a mile away from a bus stop. The closest bus stop was 3.5 miles away, with a 1600ft difference in elevation. Since there is no way that I'm currently fit enough to hike up those 3.5miles, plus the 4 to the camp, within 6 hours, I took a taxi. To get home though, was difficult because the cab company wouldn't go there to get me. At this point, it was only a little after 8am, so I started walking down the mountain to get into town. Halfway down, I had service, so I called around for cabs servicing the area. The only one that did only accepts physical addresses, not 'cross streets' (I called it an intersection, apparently it's called cross streets here), so to call back when I had a physical address. Okay fine. An hour and a half later (It took about 2.5 hours to get down), I used the number of a house to make an address. The guy found two, so he asked for the cross street, and THEN they sent the cab. So in the end, lesson learned, go during a weekday to make use of the buses, and simply hike up to the trail head and back. :D The Hammock:Worked like a charm. I know the website /claims/ that the hammock can carry my weight, but...you gotta see this thing. The material is nearly sheer. All I kept thinking was, what if it's wrong and it breaks while I'm in it? Pain + embarrassment = terror. Not only did I have to trust the fabric, but also my knots. Knots. I may have practiced it over and over, but I'd never actually put it to use. After many youtube videos and texts with my dad (thank goodness because asking my mom, while hilarious, would have confused the hell out of me. I remember her trying to help me with long division in 3rd grade. Disaster. They set up division differently in Cuba.), I settled on the knots, but trusting them? Let's just say that it took about an hour after set-up along with a slide downhill underneath the hammock before I got into it. It was comfy, to say the least. I don't think I'll ever go back to sleeping on the ground except in extreme weather conditions. I move a lot at night, and although it required a bit of patience, I found that I was able to twist and turn without issue. I need to replace the 'biners with soft shackles eventually, but for now, the whole set-up of hammock and suspension weighs less than 8oz, and when I checked the trees in the morning to make sure that there wasn't any damage done, all was well.So, total miles over that weekend: 11.5Temps: High in the upper 70s, Low in the mid 40s.Elevation Changes: 800 day 1 (Up), 2200 day 2 (down)Need to work my way up to 8, so much training to go!

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522700,"Hello hello!!!!!!!No new gear at the moment, but I've managed to complete my spreadsheet of gear that I need to get, links and all. It's kinda nice, knowing what I need. I've made substitutions here and there and I'll probably make more in the future, but making substitutions is easier than trying to figure things out from zero. I'm upping my daily walking routine today to 3 miles with my pack on. I'll be seeing a lot more of the city, haha. I'm also going to be testing out my grandma's pecan pie recipe for the first time. Somehow, that seems much more daunting than starting the trail! Bright side is that I now know what amaretto is, and I've made my first liqueur store purchase as a result! The poor cashier must've thought my ID was fake until he realized that I clearly look older than 21. It probably didn't help me much when he noticed my phone cover is of a 'cartoon.' (It's an anime)That's all I've got for now. Normally, I would have waited until I had something more, but I'm also testing out my journal since I've been encountering a few glitches with it, e.g. not showing that I updated at the end of February, and not having the new entry the default entry even though that's what it's supposed to do (I re-checked my journal options to make sure).

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534606,"It's kind of funny how my 'why' for wanting to thru-hike has changed over the years. When I first learned about the trail and started getting into it, I really just wanted to do it for the adventure, the challenge. While that is certainly still part of it, it's no longer the main reason. When I continued to push myself through school, that want for adventure grew, but so did my need for a break. Something new that wasn't school. Even after I got my Bachelor's, I still took classes around my work schedule. I have only had about two semesters with no classes whatsoever since my mother put me in pre-school. I love it, I really do, but between finally having the classes I need to apply to grad school and actually applying, my need for a break before that starts has definitely become a major factor in the staying power of my want to thru-hike. Now....now I have another reason, one I wish I didn't have, but the feelings centered around it are so strong, it's probably going to be what helps me make that push on those days where everything hurts too much to keep going, where the weather is rainy and windy and my shoes are still wet from the day before. It's still tied into needing a break though. So it's a feeling that's built on another feeling and really, I can't wait to get out there. Away from what I know, away from pressures, away to a place where all that I need is on my back, where I can think and breathe and meet all of you amazing people.So I guess my ""why"" didn't change so much as grew. It's not one reason anymore. It's a bunch of reasons that keep building up and pointing in the same direction.Or maybe I just want to see the stars.281 days left, and my excitement knows no bounds!",,When the Why Changes,"May 23, Mon",0

Amphipod Cap Light - .5oz reported weight. Won't get here until later this week. I won't be doing night hiking, so I just need something for around camp or the off chance I need the bathroom at night. I'm going to try testing it in the local park or in my sister's room at night.

It's about an hour away from Snicker's Gap Trail Head, so, of course, I said yes :D Now I get to have my first overnight hike on the AT itself XD With the added bonus that although it's only going to be September and not quite as cold as Georgia in March, it's still a hell of a lot colder than Miami (As I type this, it's 91* out, with a low of 81*). I'LL ALSO HAVE MY QUILTS AND TARP BY THEN YES! Obviously I'm quite excited now. We're still having thunderstorms every day here, and the tarp should be here in about a week (Crossing fingers), so I should be able to practice setting it up in crazy weather (I don't know if you've ever experienced a Miami thunderstorm, but they can get pretty intense wind/rain wise). Cold weather is my biggest issue in trying to practice, since it doesn't exist here. I'm still planning on a November hike in Georgia, but that one might be a little more complicated to get to.In family news, a cousin of mine will be getting here next week!

Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550627,"Wow it's been a while!How's everyone getting on? It's almost trail time!!!!!It's been a busy couple of months since my cousin got here. All her paperwork is done, so all she needs now is her license and work permit. Last weekend we took her to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure for Halloween Horror Nights, and we all had a blast :D In training news, I was unfortunately, not able to go to VA, my mom's conference was only for a day, rather than a weekend, so there wasn't any time. I've been doing some walking and swimming, not as consistently as I should, but more than before, so yay! I've also been using a balance disk to help me strengthen my ankles and improve my balance, so that's been fun. Walking-wise, I've gotten to where I can walk 3 miles with a 25 pound pack, with an extra .25 miles without a pack after every mile (To simulate a food/bathroom/""Picture"" break while still moving), for a total of 3.75 miles (Up from 1 miles two months ago). The track that I've been using has bleachers on both sides, so I'm hoping to incorporate some stair climbing with my walks. I've tried using the stair master at the gym, but it's not the same as being out with my pack in the heat pushing myself up and down the stairs. The gym is air-conditioned, can't take my pack, and since the steps are moving, it's not the same. I also can't practice going down. So I'll start stairs come November. Each of the two bleachers has six stair cases, so it's better than nothing! I'll also eventually use the hill at the other end of the park as well, and a little running and yoga, but I'm adding things in one at a time. Anything to stop me from quitting training on myself!!!! Gear-wise! I HAVE MY QUILTS! AND TARP! AND JUST GOT MY PACK IN ON FRIDAY :D It's all great! I took a picture of my hammock setup with tarp and underquilt, showed my mom, and she said it looked like I was in an airplane XP The quilts are gorgeous! I'm treating them as if they are made of tissue paper because I am notorious for accidentally breaking things (Think Hagrid from Harry Potter). They are so well made, though! I wish I could do that kind of thing, but a) Sewing machines scare the life out of me, b) Did I mention the whole, breaks things easily?, and c) my goodness would I make a mess of things O.o The tarp is large. I'll need a lot more practice to really keep the rain out, of course, but I get really good coverage since my hammock is so short (Yay for the short genes!). The cord I was using was the same I used for my ridgeline, but I had to change it out because I couldn't get my taut-line hitch to stay when pulled. The new cord holds well (Both were from zpacks. The one I'm using now is the yellow and black one). The pack I went with is the zpacks zero, 27L. I added in two side pockets, the front mesh pocket, hip belt, and a small front pocket, all of which add onto the pack's capacity. I put in the gear I have so far (Not including the hammock since I'm still figuring out the bugnet and it's currently all wrapped up in it), and I still have plenty of space for clothes and food. So far, with what I have in it, the weight comes out to about 4.25lbs. The hammock and bugnet will add another 8-10ozs, the clothes another couple of pounds (Rain jacket/skirt, puffy jacket, down booties, thermal underwear, normal jacket), and the rest of the things I'm still missing (Camera, batteries/charger, bear bag, etc.) another pound at most. I didn't include my poles or the clothing I plan to wear while hiking in that. I'll put up the total once I get to that final weigh in before the trail.I'm so happy with my gear right now! And while I still have things to get, it's not much, and having my big three complete makes everything so much more real and amazing and exciting!!!!!!!! :DThe most important thing for me to focus on now is going to be reducing my weight. I've gotten my pack weight down about as much as it's going to go, with any changes from here on out being in ounces and grams. More important is going to be getting my own weight down because at this point, half a pound in my pack isn't going to make as much of a difference as losing body fat will. MUST BUCKLE DOWN ON TRAINING! MUST BUCKLE DOWN ON TRAINING! Maybe if I repeat that enough, I'll keep at it. My goal right now is to go down a couple dress sizes while increasing strength in my legs and improving cardio. That's all I have for now, I think! I might be able to get up to 4 miles by November, which would mean I'm in line with my schedule. HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE???????? Oh. Yeah. And grad school applications. Can't forget those.

Always nice for it to be free :P Tuesday I only walked a mile (.75 w/ pack), so I did some exercises in the pool to make up for it. I really felt it in my calves on Wednesday.Wednesday was a killer day weather-wise! It was so hot out. It's the middle of October and still in the 80's. I had observation hours to do, so we weren't able to stay out the full time, but my cousin and I got in 2.75 miles (2.25 w/ pack) while my mom did 3 (She was even running some! Go momma!!!). I didn't feel too wiped out afterwards. A little drained because I forgot my water, but I can feel my legs getting stronger.Yesterday, my cousin was too tired (Slept from 12 all the way until we woke her up for dinner, hahahaha), and my mom had to go with my dad to a doctor's appointment, so I either had to go alone or not at all. Surprisingly for me, I actually went alone! It was fluctuating between drizzling and raining the entire time, and it was awesome!!!! I wasn't getting over heated, I had the track almost completely to myself (People showed up towards the end of my session), and I even got a compliment from one of the people who did come out for exercising with a weighted pack. It was absolutely lovely. I also forgot my poncho at home, and I may have caught a cold, but oh well. Did my full 3.75 (3 w/ pack) or 4 (Not sure. I lost track of where I was on mile two, so I walked an extra lap with the pack on to be sure). I felt like I could easily walk another mile when I finished, so I'm feeling really good right now. The plan for today is to walk after lunch. My dad is having a small procedure done in the early afternoon, so while my mom is with him for that, I'm going to do my walk, then we'll head out for dinner at about 6. I should have enough time to do a full 3.75 miles and shower. NO EXCUSES!!!Maybe I'll be able to drag my cousin out with me, if she's awake long enough, haha.Oh oh oh! I also ordered gaiters from dirty girl for my mom and I, and my mom's underquilt (Enlightened equipment) for when she meets up with me in Maryland. It's 3/4 length to my 1/2 length, and 10* warmer than mine. That way she'll for sure be warm, and if mine isn't warm enough for the winter weather, I can use hers until it warms up a bit. I ordered the down booties for myself along with it.  Now I just need to put in the orders for her pack (Zpacks zero) and hammock (Hennessey).Still working on the bugnet. The first one we made was too short on the top, so I need to go buy more fabric. Other than that, just need to get a camera (Mine stopped working on day two of the camino. Lasted about 10 years. I'm sad to see it go), a watch, a camera mount (The stick pic), and some guide books to go through. And the clothes. Have the majority of my winter clothes.

After that it was work, holiday shopping, and application work, (Plus a healthy dose of laziness, of course) and I haven't even been on here! So, I'll get down to business then, huh?Gypsy J, Raid, and I went on a shakedown hike to test our gear in cold weather. Cold where I'm from is when the temps get into the low 70s, so when the temps got down to (At last check by another camper) 21 degrees, it was definitely a good test for cold weather.The hike wasn't so bad, actually. My body coped better than I expected, so GO STAIRS! As long as I go at a pace that I can keep up over time (Even though I hike as slow as molasses), I should be able to average the 8 miles a day I want to get to at the beginning with little issue. And if I can get my lazy but out of the hammock early enough in the morning, since I hike uphill at 1 mph and downhill even slower, lol.We had initially wanted to get up to Springer, but we weren't sure we would make it all the way before dark. It was also getting really cold very quickly, and don't get me started on that wind! More than one person thought the gusts had gotten up to 40mph (It sounded like there was a hurricane outside! I probably would have enjoyed it more if I'd been able to keep warm). Luckily for us, there was Black Gap Shelter not too far off, and we stayed there, along with quite a few other hikers. I was surprised to see so many people. It was nice :DSo my setup: I had my hammock, under and over quilts, the tarp, and the Fronkey style bugnet (I brought the bugnet along because the woman that was sewing it for me had just finished it the day before, and I hadn't had a chance to test it out. IT WORKED GREAT! Not that there were any bugs around in that weather, but I was able to get in and out of the hammock as well as close the bugnet from in the hammock without issue.Where it worked: Temps-wise, I had enough insulation from my clothes and quilts to be warm.Where it failed (Spectacularly, I might add): I was only warm when the wind wasn't coming in (Which was rarely). The wind was blowing too hard for the tarp to stay in place. The fixed knots held, but the taut-line hitches slid up, loosening the tension. The wind was also blowing right through me. Once I started getting cold, I looked at the thermometer that Raid had let me use, saw that it was 35*, looked at the time, which was only 8 or so, and realized I wouldn't make it through the night. Thankfully, I was able to take up Raid's offer to bunk in her tent with her should my kit fail as it did. THANK YOU!Funnily enough, the night didn't end there. We were in the tent trying to sleep, but it was still pretty cold. At one point she woke up and started to get out. I didn't know why until she told me that the tent had collapsed on her end. No wonder it was so cold! In the end, she was able to get the tent back up by using a log nearby as the anchor since her stake had been lost in the wind like my poncho. (I had tried to use my poncho to break the wind while in the hammock, but I didn't get it fixed well enough. It decided to accomplish its life-long dream of flight, and I couldn't find it. In the morning, Raid was the one to find it stuck on some thorny bushes, so yay!)Where to fix my kit: First thing's first, I needed to find something to help me with the wind issue in case of nights like this. After listening to the different ideas from several hikers, and researching at home, I decided to go with the wintersock from dream hammock. I ordered it in Vader Blue, and while the hammock setup is being referred to as a burrito (Raid's description), we have decided that when it is in wintersock mode, it is an empanada XD Then there's also my rain gear which I won't be ordering until January. I took the poncho along just in case, as well as to approximate the weight and space of the rain gear once I have it. It can't fly away if I'm already wearing it, right???? My down socks arrived a couple of hours after my flight had left for Atlanta, so I wasn't able to take those on this trip, making another layer of warmth I'll be able to add to my kit. The last thing I've thought to include in my kit that I hadn't been planning to bring, but have since changed my mind, are those hand and feet warmers.I'd heard of them, and had been going back and forth as to weather to bring them or not. Gypsy J had brought some of the foot ones in her kit, and when we were hanging out in Raid's tent, she gave me a pair to use. It was too cold in the hammock for them to work as well as they could have, but they definitely helped some, especially once I was in the tent. They should also work better when I have the down socks on. The hike back was cold. We stopped at the hike inn to warm up and eat a bit, before continuing down the mountain. I'm in love with my trekking poles. They made the downhill much easier on my knees. That, plus I'm really slow on the downhill. The offset is that I don't need nearly as many breaks when going downhill as uphill, so it helps to even out the time.Now it's just a waiting game for the wintersock, ordering the last of my gear, and deciding on what camera I want to use (The camera I'd wanted originally is no longer available at a decent price, and I'm not paying 2000$ for a camera whose original price is 250$. Nope. Not happening.)I did get some stuff for Christmas, but I'll put that into a different post, along with responding to a few questions!I don't have my computer with me at the moment (I'm at my dad's house for the holidays using his computer), so I'm not certain of the countdown, but if I remember correctly, it should be down to 63 days now!!!! 63 DAYS!!!

My mom got me AWOL's book for 2017 along with AGG's elevation map set. The maps came in earlier, so I've been going around showing them to everyone, even my coworkers, in my absolute excitement!!!! My dad gave me the 2016 editions of AWOL's book and the Data book from the ATC. He also got me the 2017 version of the Data book, along with two other AT related books. I'm looking forward to reading them through! He also got me some really strong headlamps. The one I have should be more than enough for the beginning, but if, once I've had more experience on the trail, I decide to do a little night hiking, I'll definitely be asking for them to be sent up. Last but not least, my aunt got me the watch I wanted, so more on that when it arrives and I've had a chance to fiddle with it.A coworker of mine also got me a book. Soul....something. I can't remember the exact title, but it seems really interesting. It's by a psychologist that is also a wilderness guide, and it talks about his thoughts on the two together. Since it has to do with two of the things I'm very interested, psychology and hiking, she got it for me. I haven't started it yet, but I'm hoping to get to it before the week is done.Now all I have to do is read, and finish applications. Applications first though.

I am waaaay too white and seriously lacking this infamous tanning ability I have heard of. If my sister wasn't so capable of it, I would assume it to be a myth. (Apparently I didn't get enough genes from my mother's have of the dna. While neither my sister nor I are as dark as she is, I burn like my dad, and my sister can tan so well she can be darker than her during the summer when she tries.) I get burned easily, even when it's somewhat overcast. I'm the only one in my family that gets sunburns where my hair parts. They still make fun of me for it!!!!! So for me, strong sunblock is something I can't leave behind, no matter what time of year, and even though in the winter I'll be mostly bundled up, there will probably be days where it's a little warmer, at least around noon some days. That's how it was in Boston at least. I'm preparing for the worst and hoping for the best!!!!!63 MORE DAYS! (I think.

My coworker made a countdown with the dry-erase board, with a stick figure hiking up a mountain (Trekking poles, too) and my time frame :D I love it!!!!Gear updates:The watch. It's definitely everything I wanted. It's the Casio Pathfinder PAG240-1CR. SN on the band! I wanted to replace it and put in a paracord band because the band is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL, but I knew that when I bought it. I was going to replace it anyway, and at the time, the other band types made it more expensive, so I wasn't going to waste extra money when I wasn't going to keep the band to begin with. Anywho, getting that band off was a mission and a half. I was going to take it off myself, but my mom was paranoid that I would destroy the watch somehow. (It's not like I put furniture together or anything of course.) To appease her paranoia, we went to the mall where we usually get our watch bands adjusted. Everyone we spoke with said they didn't know how. We finally found a kiosk that claimed to do watch repair, but the guy was ridiculously rude, and I didn't like the way he talked to my mom. At all. So we left. We found another watch repair shop, and the guy spent 20 minutes trying to get just one of the screws loose before giving up. End of story, we went home, I got out the screwdriver kit, and took the band off. XPThe jackets. I ordered the mountain hardware ghost whisperer, just waiting for that to come in. Also on the way is the rain jacket from AGG. Got a call from them today at work about shipping details, and it made my day!

Not really feeling up to it at the moment.With schools, I am happy to note that all of my applications have been submitted, and I've heard back from two schools already! The rest won't get back to me until the trail, but I won't be too stressed anymore. While one of the two said no, the other said yes! And it was also one of the ones tied for my top school :D I'M GOING TO BE A GRAD STUDENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course it definitely means my trail window is going to be until the end of July, maybe the first week of August if I can do most of the prep work online ahead of time, so I'll see where I can get to, and if I don't finish, do what I can during breaks from school. Work-wise, my last day was Thursday, and my boss took us all out for lunch to say good-bye. My coworkers are awesome :D On the family side, my dad's in the ICU. He's been there since Wednesday. At the moment he's stable, and we're crossing fingers for him to get better. So glad he was down here when everything went to hell, you have no idea! Of course, his only concern up until we left that first night was taking care of his cat, which we made sure was alive and well. At least his snarkiness is completely intact, as evidenced by his silently telling us to shut up and get him some ice  And the finger wagging. Believe you me, he makes his displeasure known quite readily! We're taking that as a good sign.It's a short one for today. Happy trails to all those having started last month and to those starting this month! Only 23 more days~",,News and Updates,"Feb 05, Sun",0
Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554640,"My daddy died on Monday.It hurts and it sucks and the viewing is tonight...His house is about a four hour drive from ours. It takes a couple different highways and county roads to get there. There's this one part of the trip that eventually leads to four different routes that take you to his house. Whenever I got there, I would always call him to ask him which way to take, and he'd tell me why two of them sucked and which of the other two he suggested I take. Then he'd tell me to be careful on the part that I'm on because it was full of crazy people passing other cars at fast speeds and they don't always know what they're doing. (It's a two lane road, one for each way of traffic, with a high speed limit). I had to drive up there yesterday to get clothes for him for the viewing. Luis went with me so that I wouldn't be alone. It was the first time I had to go up there without being able to call him, and without him telling me to be careful. Of course, me being me, I'm still clumsy and awkward as hell, which obviously entails my having accidentally broken one of the doors in the house trying to close it with what my daddy called my gorilla fists. (I told you about the broom handle, yes?) It also included that awkward moment while grabbing a sandwich for dinner at Subways before driving the four hours back home when the poor unsuspecting woman filling out our order asked why Luis didn't take me out for Valentine's day and, after an awkward moment of silence I told her that he was my ex. She, of course, looked between us a few times before letting us know that she wasn't going to ""touch that with a ten foot pole."" So. Good luck to all of you out there that are going to encounter the awkwardness that is me.About ten minutes ago, my sister's dog (A husky by name of Midnight) was taken back outside after slipping in when my mom was getting him water. Then we saw pee on the floor so we went to clean it up. The pee? Right next to where I had put my gear to start going through one more time before taking off. Then we noticed the pee wasn't just next to it. Apparently he took my gear to be a tree and marked it. This included AWOL's book. Good news? It was the 2016 version I got for Christmas, not the 2017 version. Bad news? It was from my dad. He would have laughed his butt off if he were here! Definitely would have found that hilarious.Yesterday was also the first Valentine's day where I didn't have a valentine. For as long as I can remember, every Valentine's day, my mom, my sister, and I would find a box of chocolates and a card for each of us from daddy. When he wasn't with us for the holiday, he would call or text us a happy valentine's and told us he loved us. 
Today my mom went over some legal things that we would need to take care of soon, including his car. When she mentioned it, I went to it and took out the faded, old, flower from his car. It is 21 years old. It used to be a decorative piece of a dress I wore on my first day of Kindergarten. When I outgrew the dress, my dad kept the flower and put it on the dashboard of his car. He changed cars twice in that time, and every single time, the flower went along for the ride. It was there on every family trip, every outing to Starbucks, and every visit home once he moved away.
There's so much more. 
I really really miss him.",,Not a Good Week,"Feb 15, Wed",0
Lightweight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555378,"My sister took me to the airport this morning for my flight. Ended up having to take a taxi back (the driver was really funny :D) because the woman checking bags wouldn't let me on the plane. She said I had to have been there three hours early! Which was weird. But there was nothing I could do, so I had to take the afternoon flight. Called hiker hostel to let them know, then I was lucky enough that someone agreed to shuttle me over even though it was late. (Thanks Dave!)Got to meet some people at the hostel before lights out. Well. I mostly sat there not knowing how to interact with so many people at once (So many being 5) and they were really nice, so yay!I WILL GET BETTER!Also met a guy who was in the Navy like my dad. My dad would have really liked him, too. Tomorrow's the day!",,Off to Hiker Hostel,"Feb 28, Tue",0
