To be determined...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570161,"Greetings from Monson.  ATC (app trail conservancy) told me to plan at least 10 days to get through the 100 mile wilderness but I sneaked on some extra jet fuel.  But it's like a black out period cause of the remoteness made even worse because my phone took a crap in the rain.  6 days of walking with extra loaded pack (more food - about 2lbs per day so an extra 20 lbs - than usual) in mostly rainy days and humid was interesting (go ahead and read between the lines).  I was spent when I arrived yesterday afternoon but coke, pizza, beer and a bed did the trick - and a day off the trail today.  Met lots of people on the trail going both ways.  All of us SOBOs (southbound thru hikers) we're bitching and planning and worrying while the NOBOs were like supermen - nothing bothered them and they put on miles like they were wearing jet packs.  Of course they all looked like they'd spent a year at a concentration camp. The majority of folks are very intelligent, educated and normal - not what one might think of considering they have no life but the trail for 4-6 months.  Lots of x-military, youngsters out of college and then a smattering of old farts.  One woman maybe 40 I passed started in Canada and was headed to Key West!  Physically, I'm not fit for this (maybe 50%) but they tell me in 5 weeks, no problem...great, after I hike the White Mountains (check google earth for a preview :) .  Can't get my pics yet cause of the phone issues but it rained or was cloudy for 5 of 6 days so only one day of cool views from mountain tops anyway but very gorgeous and remote up here.  More later...hope all is well in the real world.","Abol bridge

To be determined...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570749,"Well, not sure what to say about this but I left the trail yesterday, yep 13 days in.  Physically, I'm sore but fine - just had enough.  I was not having fun - not that I expected to be deliriously skipping down the trail, but I thought it would be enjoyable most the time.  The trail is very hard but that's a lame excuse.  Truth be told, hiking alone is lonely, duh. I thought of all things, I could handle the alone part, but without being able to share the experience during the day or at night, I became focused on the misery of it all.  The prospect of 145 more days of the same just lost it's appeal.  I happened to cross paths with a couple that I met earlier and the husband was headed home to Michigan to go back to work and the wife was staying and meeting friends to join her.  I was 3 miles into that days walk, and just asked him if he wanted company for the ride home - which he gladly accepted - that's all I needed to hear I guess.  Turned around and hiked back and then he and I drove to Detroit Metro, picked up a one way rental and drove home - 23 hrs later.  So, I'm sucking up the pride but planning to head back with a friend who was going to join me in New Hampshire in 3 weeks and hopefully my attitude will improve and I'll continue on the trail...at least that's the plan.  I added some pics finally now that I have a phone again.  I'll restart the blogging once I hit the trail on July 24th. :)","

To be determined...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573501,"As planned, buddy Bill and I just finished a weeks hiking. Went 5 days on the AT finishing on top of Mt Washington. Next day with the threat of hail (!) decided to move to the adirondacks in NY and hiked three ~5000 ft peaks near Lake Placid. It was beautiful and a great finish to the trip. No more talk of thru hiking for me  - rather be home. The thru hiker culture  is unique and I give them a ton of credit for accomplishing a extremely difficult journey. We camped on a 4000ft peak with a couple and their 16 mo old baby girl ""roo"" (Ellie) She learned to walk while on the trail 4 months ago and will be finishing the whole thing soon. They're a social media sensation. Another couple I crossed paths with a couple of times were engaged in the 100 mile wilderness and plan to be married on the final summit in November! Then there was the ""omelette guy"" who gets on the trail at 7:30am til the last hiker pasts him ...everyday since May 15th!...and makes a huge egg scramble (the record is a 24 egg omelette!) or pancakes , juice, coffee, pop, bananas and potatoes in a tarped hut right on the trail. Says he just likes the hikers and it gives him something to do and makes him happy. He wouldn't accept a dime. I'm sticking to fishing. Thanks for reading - sorry the story was cut short :). I added a few last pics.","
