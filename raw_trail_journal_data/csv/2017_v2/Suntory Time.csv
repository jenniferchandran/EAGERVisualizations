Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554890,"After a lot of thought, I have decided to continue and finish my hike of the Appalachian Trail. Last year, I started on the Amicalola Falls and ended my southern portion of my hike at Possum Creek in Virginia, near Atkins Virginia. I also restarted hiking last summer 2016 at North Adams, Massachusetts, which is the final road crossing before you enter the Vermont section of the Appalachian Trail. I hiked from there into the Whites and stopped at Lincoln, New Hampshire. At the end of October, I hiked a large section of the AT in Connecticut. I hiked two day hikes and a two night trip from Southern Massachusetts to Salisbury, Connecticut. It felt good to be back on the trail and I'm sorry that I had to end my hike in New Hampshire. So, I am going to restart my hike at Possum Creek and hike north in Virginia. I can't wait to restart, and I am going to head down to Virginia from my home in Upstate New York around Mid March. I'm hoping that the weather will be good and that I can get up to speed faster as I weighed more last year. I will share the story of all of my upcoming travels with all of you. I will be taking my iPhone with me and I will write in my blog while I am on the trail. I am looking forward to getting to Maine in late July early August. I want to swim every day which is what I did many times on the AT last year.

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554894,"I wanted to write briefly about the changes that I have made to my gear since I started the Appalachian Trail last year in 2016. First, I swapped my heavy Lowe Alpine Contour Mountain IV backpack and got a new backpack from Hyperlight, which does it manufacturing and sales in Maine. It's a wonderful pack and the people at Hyperlight have great service. Some of the seam sealers came off, and Hyperlight fixed it for me. The only problem with the Hyperlight pack is that I can't carry a huge amount of stuff, but perhaps that is a good thing. My Primus Stove had a burner that was too big and it got clogged, so I switched to an MSR Pocket Rocket, which I absolutely love. I am keeping my Eureka Midori Solo tent. It is just perfect for me. There is a section that is just big enough for one person, and then there is a large vestibule where I can put my stuff and even cook. I love it. I know that so many people like Big Agnes Tents, but I am a huge fan of Eureka, partly because its main research and development facility is in Conklin, NY, near where I live. I also bought a small emergency Petzl Headlamp, which I think is amazing. It has a red light so that you can read in a shelter, without keeping anyone else up. When I got to Hot Springs, North Carolina, I swamped out my hiking books to Adidas Trail Runner, which really helped me achieve a faster hiking speed. My Snow Peak Titanium brew pot worked incredibly well, so I am using it this year. I have transitioned to synthetic clothing. The only cotton that I am taking is a cotton towel that I use to lift my cook pot. I also use it as a pillow when matched with my clothing stuff sack. I will also use a Petzl Tikka Headlamp. I also have a titanium set of utensils and a titanium cup. I'm so happy that I don't have to spend a bunch of money on gear this year. I still haven't consolidated everything yet and I have to do that soon.",,Virginia on the AT,"Feb 20, Mon",0

My hometown got dumped with over 33 inches of snow. I will be starting from where I left off at the south north of Atkins, VA. I am very excited to finally begin hiking the trail again. At the beginning I will just be hiking by myself, but some of my friends have expressed an interest in hiking with me in April/May. It would be great to have some company on the trail. I met one of my friends on the trail last year when we decided to hike together. Another friend is transitioning jobs and has some free time on the AT. Both of my friends want to hike the AT in Virginia. I really want to finish my hike this year. I so sorry that I didn't finish last year, but I have waited many months for another shot at the AT. My father will be driving me down to Virginia on Monday, March 20th. The snow accumulation north of Atkins, VA, should be negligible once spring arrives.

My dad and I drove down yesterday and we stayed the night in Wytheville VA. It was 26 degrees when we left and 62 when we arrived. Got up early today and had an awesome breakfast at the motel (Hampton Inn) and we drove up to the small AT parking area where I stopped hiking last year after starting March 17, 2016 at the Springer approach trail. After hiking the 556 miles, I shuttled north from here to hike from North Adams MA to Franconia Notch NH so this year I will hike from Possum Creek to North Adams and then start in NH where I stopped. So I begin again today. I am hiking my way back into shape again. It worked last year. I was afraid there might still be ice on the trail but didn't find any today. I hiked over two ridges. I saw that a hiker named Billy Goat stayed at Knot Maul shelter last night but I didn't see him today. I am ahead of the bubble but they will catch me. I thought I might get as far as Chestnut Knob Shelter but crapped out at the campsite just before the main ridge. The afternoon turned sunny without much wind. No problems with water now. The creek that was .3 beyond the campsite was gushing. I put up my tent and enjoyed the setting afternoon sun. It's good to be on the Trail again.","Possum Creek Near Atkins, Virginia

There was a steep ascent up Chestnut Knob. A section hiker named Visa overtook me and was really cruising. I stopped at the pond on the ridge. Plenty of water this year. I made it up to the top of Chestnut Knob where I found the shelter to be wonderful. It's fully enclosed and very nice inside. Billy Goat did stay there last night I noticed in the log. I keep hearing that people up north are freezing today but it was a beautiful day without a cloud. Tonight will be cold and I thought about getting to St. Lukes hostel but decided I wasn't going to get to the trailhead in time for the shuttle. So I decided to camp at Walker Gap at this beautiful campsite. Good spring too. It will be cold but I have a 20 degree bag, liner, and heavier down jacket and extra base layer so I think I'll be fine.

I finally got packed and moving around 11 AM. Definitely a late start. After a climb out of Walker Gap the ridge wasn't too much of a climb but it was not level and rocky and hard to make up a lot of time. I decided to head to St. Lukes Hostel tonight. They agreed to pick me up at the Rt. 623 road crossing at 4pm and I was there on time. After a short drive I checked into the hostel. It's an old farmhouse and very nice. I was surprised to find that Billy Goat was there and some other hikers. He was taking a nero and a zero. So we're having a communal dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow.

After a good breakfast of eggs and bacon and hot coffee, I packed up and was dropped off at the trailhead at Rt. 623. The hostel staff seem to be excited that the bubble is starting to arrive. The zero day was a real restorative. I felt rested and ready to hike. The trail seemed more forgiving today. Fewer rocky sections. I passed by Jenkins Shelter and signed the log book. There was a volunteer trail maintainer there and I had a nice talk with him. But I pushed on up the ascent to the next ridge and then on to the big descent to Laurel Creek. Much warmer today. Seems like a good place to camp and last water until my destination tomorrow, Helvey's Mill Shelter.

I quickly found the good campsites and the picnic table that had been described in comments from Guthooks. So much better than my campsite last night. I will provide a few more directions with a comment to Guthooks so others won't have the same problem. After the ascent after Laurel Creek, I got moving. But by 11AM the rain had started. It became heavy though I had been warned and put on rain gear. Somehow rain makes you hike faster. I got through to the dirt/gravel road leading to the RT 52 and I-77 crossing. Another hiker from Zurich, Switzerland conferred with me about the correct trail direction. Then the last descent to the highway road walk and crossing of I-77. I made it up the last ascent to Helvey's Mill Shelter. ReddMage was there when I arrived. He has his own Youtube channel and has been on the trail since February.

Another hiker had showed up around 11PM last night after finishing 25 miles. As for me, I got up around 7:30 AM. I had breakfast and got packed up. As I got back to the trail I met another nobo hiker, Johnny Tsunami. He apparently loves night hiking. I had a very entertaining conversation. Part of what I like about the AT is the conversation with fellow hikers. I got going around 10AM. I was making progress but the going was a bit rough with constant small ups and downs. The threatened rain never materialized. I finally got to the VA 611 crossing around 4:30 and started up Brushy Mountain. The spring shown in Guthooks was dry. The climb was slow going. But I finally arrived at Jenny Knob Shelter around 7:45. Tomorrow I am going to do a nero to Trent's Grocery. Johnny T. said he was heading there. I've got the shelter to myself.

Next morning it was still raining. I waited a bit for it to stop. I got on the trail at 11AM. But then it started raining again. Oh well, no rain no Maine, etc. The trail was in great shape. Thank you Roanoke Hiking Club! I met a couple on a flip-flop hike with their 9 month old baby. That kid will be the youngest to thru-hike the AT.

Beautiful day with sun and temperatures in the 60's. I hiked through a rhododendron tunnel sometimes. There were six stream crossings. I got to Wapiti Shelter around 5PM.

But as I reached the ridge at 3900 feet it was totally fogged in and the fog never burned off all day. So no views for me. Just fog. I got to Sugar Run Road around 4:30PM and hiked down to check in at Woods Hole. I have heard about this place for a year and it's great to finally be here. I was showering up before dinner and found a large tick. Yuck. Oh well, at least these large ones are not supposed to transmit Lyme disease. I am taking a zero day tomorrow.

I am not sure about that. Pretty close to the water from what I could see. There's no water at the campsite but I filled up at the spring we passed at mile 643.6 so we have enough water for the evening. Once we start out tomorrow we will be at a water source before too long. It sounds like there might be a good chance of thunderstorms and severe weather tomorrow.

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559781,The Trout Creek campsite was not the greatest. Too close to the road. I am hoping my water filter worked well with creek water. Got up and packed for a long climb back up to the ridge. Good views. As I approached Dragon's Tooth the ascent was rocky and steep. It was also very hot. Hard to imagine when I was freezing 3 days ago. Some German student day hikers offered me some water and it was appreciated. Another Virginia Tech student offrered me a burrito from their food service at VT. Very tasty! I finally made it to the hostel just as it was getting dark. Most ofb the hikers I met at Niday Shelter are here. Even Peevy and Upchuck! Too bad it was too late for the grill at the grocery store. Iam taking a zero tomorrow and will get to the grill then.,"Trout Creek Campsite

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559875,I had a restful zero day at Four Pines. The van took me to two stores for resupply. I was able to get my supply box that was mailed there. I had a nice burger at the local market. Beautiful day to sit out front of the hostel (sort of like a garage with lots of comfy furniture out front). Now I am wondering when to send my colder weather gear back. Maybe I'll wait 2 more weeks. Not sure if I'm hiking on or taking another zero tomorrow. Then again I am not sure about being on McAfee on Saturday. I keep hearing about the mobs up there on weekends.,"Four Pines Hostel

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559973,Took another zero at Four Pines. Nice to be sitting out front on a warm day. You can see how big it is inside from my photo. Today I got shuttled to the Homeplace restaurant with another NOBO hiker Penguin. It was awesome. AYCE. Great fried chicken. Pinto beans. Gallons of sweet tea. This is a hiker must.

I heard from Reddit that there might be trail magic between Wind Rock and McAfee Knob this weekend. Then again, there was another Reddit rumor that Richard Simmons hiked the AT back in the 70's. Sketchy. But when I got to the road crossing I found two groups dispensing trail magic. So I had a burger and a soda. I got to the Shelter around 5:30 and decided to stop. I plan a short hike tomorrow over McAfee Knob and then staying at Campbell Shelter. I've just got to get one of those iconic photos! I find I've had to run into the woods with my trowel more often today if you know what I mean. I hope it's not the big G. Maybe even a filter isn't always enough.","Four Pines Hostel

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560213,"I had a difficult night at John's Spring Shelter. My dysentery is worse. I had to go running for the woods too early. Then a few more times. I was not in a good place. I decided just to stay here for the day and see if I would get over it. Unlike last year, I did not have imodium or any other anti-diarrhea med. But I don't want to leave the trail. So I decided to wait it out. I began to feel more like a human being again around 4pm. And it rained so I didn't think it would be a good idea to start out to McAfee Knob today. So I think I am on the mend at this point and that it's not Giardia. I will hike on to the summit tomorrow.","John's Spring Shelter

I wanted to enjoy McAfee Knob and the incredible views. It was a significant climb from John's Spring Shelter but it didn't feel as steep as I had expected. I got up there and it did not disappoint. Quite a few others. Once I explained about the iconic photo of the AT everyone up there wanted their own so I got drafted into camera duty. Then a couple decided (the guy did anyway) to actually pose ""the question"" to his girlfriend (she said yes) so I got drafted into more camera duty. After spending a lot of time up there I headed down to Campbell Shelter where once again I was the only one staying in the shelter. That is, until five NOBOs showed up around 7:30.

Had a nice conversation. I awoke to a beautiful morning. People were heading back up Kelly Knob to catch early sun. I felt much recovered since that bout of dysentery. I got underway but had been warned that rain would be arriving. Sure enough it began raining around noon. But it was light and my rain hat seemed to deal with the worst of it. The rain tapered off and I was able to get a decent view from Tinker Cliffs. I got to Lambert Meadow Shelter just before 5PM. I had the place to myself. The dreaded bear did not show up. Maybe he knows that he has no opportunity to get my food from the bear barrel that was installed in 2016. Hikers arrived a bit later. I had a good conversation with a hiker from Paris and shared my experience hiking the GR 65 (Chemin) in France and the various marked trails in Paris. Another hiker was from Munich, Germany. Always a small world on the AT.","Campbell Shelter

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560664,I had a great time in conversation with the hikers last night at Lambert Meadow. Got up earlier this morning and headed out before 9:30. You could say it was downhill but it did take all day for me to get to Daleville. the contrast of the AT in the mountains and sudden reentry to civilization at US220 was drastic. One minute the woods the next a busy strip. I checked into Howard Johnson Express and hit Pizza Hut across the street after a nice hot shower.

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560830,"I had a comfortable night at the Howard Johnson Express. Got up and had the complementary breakfast. I forgot to mention yesterday that I met a hiker from PA as I was close to US 220 at Daleville. He was Will da Beast and he has a popular journal at TrailJournals. We had a conversation about where to stay in Daleville and he ended up staying where I was at the Howard Johnson Express. He said that what he wanted most was a bottomless glass of Pepsi so I think he also ended up at the Pizza Hut where I had dinner. Anyway, I had some chores to do and supplies to buy. My trail pants were shot and a major seam has ripped open so I got new pants at the outfitter. I already went down several sizes. Thanks AT diet. I also stocked up on freeze dried dinners. Eventually I cycled around to Krogers to get a few more supplies and came upon Will da Beast devouring a rotisserie chicken in front of the store. I went to Three Little Pigs and it was very good.

But I did make it before 9am. I decided I still had to mail things back home and hit the supermarket (Krogers) so I decided to do another zero. I had a great lunch at Three Little Pigs and one of the owners picked me up on rt US220 and gave me a ride back to HoJo and I am very appreciative. I have taken care of all the chores now and will be heading out on the trail tomorrow, rain or shine. I did s little reading about the haunted Sarver Hollow Shelter where I stayed. The ghost is supposedly sensitive to when you oversleep and wakes you up. I don't recall any ghost waking me up when I was there but I am sorry I didn't know the story. It would have been great for Don Quixote to put in his upcoming book about the AT for Latin America.","Daleville, VA

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561542,"I was ready to hike on north of Daleville but at the last minute decided I needed a few days off to take care of some logistical issues. It was easy to get a bus from Daleville. I have been struggling with pack weight. It's all the winter gear. Nuptse down jacket, winter sleeping bag, heavy Asolo boots, etc. This is slowing me down. I have the warm weather gear but it's hard to arrange a resupply to swap this out without going home. Also, the glass lens on my InReach satellite communication unit has cracked. I didn't drop it but it must have squashed against something hard in my pack. I contacted Garmin and I have to mail it back to them in Kansas. So I am briefly off the trail and will resume once I get InReach back. I sent it FedEx and Garmin promised 3-5 days so we'll see. I depend on it to communicate with family since AT&T is so spotty on the AT. I may return to Daleville and start where I left off but I am also considering flip flopping and starting further north. I have several AMC hut reservations starting in July and will definitely keep those. If I need to finish some mid-Atlantic trail after Maine during the fall, that's what I'll do. I think I have to reconsider how I've been supplying food. I rely on freeze dried trail food but these are for two people and the weight and expense adds up. I need to come up with a better system for carrying less food and yet not starving. Suggestions from readers would be most welcome.","Daleville, VA

My dad dropped me off and I got underway around 10:30AM. It was still cold and had just rained but mercifully the rain cleared up. It was really windy and not yet very warm. I keep hearing it will be better tomorrow and for days after that. As soon as I got out of the car, I met Tank who started from Springer in February. I met a few other hikers throughout the day including a guy from Australia. The weather gradually improved and I had nice view from ledges on the way to the Tom Leonard Shelter. I reached the shelter just before 7PM. Nobody else so I'll take it even if I reputedly snore. Great to have a bear box. One good thing about all the rain lately is that all the springs and creeks are gushing. No water availability problems.","Egremont-Sheffield Road
