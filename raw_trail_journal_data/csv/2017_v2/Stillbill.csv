Stillbill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555012,"I'm
going to start this log by reviewing how I got to this point. Through
grade school and High school, I do not recall even hearing of the
Appalachian Trail (AT), maybe I was sleeping in class that day. After High school, I went on a weekend trip to the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park with my friends Bob O'Donnell and Dave
Buchele. On one of the stops that weekend, we came across the AT, and
Dave forced us, and I mean forced us to walk it for a few miles. That
hike did nothing for me. Years later, I was dating Penny Morgan and
she had said that the two of us should hike the AT. I literally
laughed in her face. I believe that it was in the summer of 2005 that I read an article in the paper about people hiking the AT. I still
remember my reaction to that article, it was “hmm”. A year later,
I read another article and was asking myself, why anyone would do
that, but after that, each year in the Spring I would start thinking
about hiking the AT. That thought would stay with me until late fall
each year. In 2012, living in greater Detroit, at a normal family
doctor's visit, I asked the doctor a few questions about if I was
physically capable of hiking the AT. He told me that I should have no
issues. 2013 saw two major operations, both of which would help me
with hiking. The big problem that I could see about this hike was
that I was a big city flatlander, and the trail is the opposite.
That is when my friend Larry Barker did God's work by getting me
transferred down to the mountains of Virginia, there each day driving
into the parking lot at work, I could see where the trail was on the
next mountain top. Now living a few minutes from it, I started day
hiking on a regular basis. My job ended in late 2015, so I needed to
start planning for life after work. It seemed to me that it was now
or never for an AT hike. With Any kind of a review, one could see
that I was not ready at any level for a hike like this. So I started
thinking of a 2017 thru hike. Throughout 2016, I was purchasing the
equipment that I would need, and increasing my training.","

My hiking mentor, Ron White (whose trail name is Pack Rat) and I went
to Grayson Highlands State Park and hiked 15 miles of the AT. You
need to see a local map of the AT to know why I did this. The trail
has a big loop in it, and that is what we hiked. Now when I come
through, I will take a short passageway and will not need to redo
this part. The hike was all rocks.

On
2/24/17: Ron and I hiked 6 miles just north of Damascus VA, which has big elevation changes. When I pass this in a few weeks, I will just
bypass this section using the Virginia Creeper trail.","

My friend Annette drove Ron and I 150 miles to Daleville VA , outside
of Roanoke where we hike south 260 miles to Damascus VA. We hiked the
9.5 miles to Lamberts Meadow shelter to find that the wind was
increasing and blowing into the open end of the shelter, so we each
set up our tents on the back side of the hill to get out of the wind.

3/3/17:
We were up before the sun and on the trail by 7 am. Up 1,000' to
Tinker Cliffs which you then have to walk along the cliffs for half a
mile. Anyone with fear of heights should not try this. The wind was
blowing strong into the cliffs. Next comes McAfee knob. This is where
everyone gets their photograph taken with their feet hanging off the
edge. No way, with the high winds and ice around, I was not getting
within 10' of the edge. We knew that it was going to get cold that
night, so we spent the night at Four Pines Hostel which is nothing
more than a 3 bay car garage w/ shower. For $5, and wood heat, it was
okay sleeping. We had hiked 16.3 miles.

Story
of the day: The Dog Story

There
was one other hiker at the hostel, a guy and his 14 year old black
lab. Two days before, the lab had a stroke and was in very bad shape.
The hiker had decided to just stay at the hostel until the dog died.
From what I could see, this seems to be a good idea. That night, the
hiker slept on the cold floor to be with his dog. When I got up in
the morning, he was getting up off the floor. Now the funny part. The
first thing he did was to go over to the sofa and say good morning to
the dog. Even after a stroke, the dog was smarter than his owner by
sleeping on the sofa and not the cold floor.

Story
of the day: Diver from Perrysburg

Ron
and I decided to go out and get a pizza which was about a half mile
down the road for which we would get free shuttle serves there and
back. Ron sat in the back and I was in the front seat. Ron asked the
driver a question about something local and the driver said that he
did not know for he was from Toledo Ohio. After I told him that I was
to, he told me he was born and raised just outside of Toledo in
Perrysburg Ohio, and that he went to BGSU. You just never know who
you are going to meet, do you.","Daleville VA

On the trail at first light. 1,210' Straight up Dragon's Tooth, this
is where we failed 6 months before. It was somewhat better this time,
so we moved on. Next come Audie Murphy monument ( Murphy was the most
decorated U.S. Soldier in World War II). Back down, then backup to
the Eastern Continental Divide. After a total for the day of 22.8
miles, we stayed at the Sarver Hollow Shelter. That night the
temperature was somewhere around 10 degrees.

3/05/17:
Hiking by 8 am. Elevation was up and down all day. We did 12.2 miles
to War Spur Shelter. Another very cold night. Back down around 10
degrees.

Story
of the day: No air at ten degrees

People
have asked me when I know that I was tough enough to attempt this
hike. The answer was that at night at 10 degrees, my air mattress
was not holding air for more than an hour at a time, so I just stopped
filling it up. That meant I was sleeping on a cold hard wood floor
with just my sleeping bag at 10 degrees and waking up feeling good.
Now that's tough.

3/6/17:
On the trail at first light. Right of the bat, was a 1,700' hike up
to Lone Pine Peak. After that it was somewhat flat for most of the
day until we went down about 1,000' to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter for
another cold night. We had hiked 12.7 miles that day.

3/7/17:
The plan for the day was to hike 12.5 miles to Rice Field Shelter on
somewhat flat ground. Early on, another hiker told us that a rain
storm was coming in that evening, and with the weather still being so
cold, it was not going to be a fun night. We changed our plan and
pushed 20.7 miles to Pearisburg, VA where we stayed at the Holiday
Motor Lodge for $20. The rain started in the evening and rained most
of the night. We had made a good plan adjustment.

3/8/17:
Watching the morning news, we saw that there was going to be a 4-8”
snow storm coming that weekend, with more very cold days and nights.
I called Annette, and she picked us up in Pearisburg for a return to
our homes in Abingdon. Ron and I agreed that we would come up with a
new plan after the storm passed.","

Well, winter came in March this year. The last 10 days we have not
seen much snow, but it has been very cold for March. Being at home in
Abingdon VA was also a good place to be for I was sick with a bad
cold for most of the week. Ron and I will be heading out the first of
next week to hike from Groseclose (Atkins) VA south to Damascus,
about 75 miles. This should be Ron's last hike with me.
3/21/17:
Ron and I got on the trail about 11 AM, the first five miles were
somewhat flat, but then we went up 4,113' Glade Mountain. We finissed the day at Partnership Shelter that is behind Mt. Rogers visitors
center. There was a total of 7 hikers in the shelter for the night.
The hike that day was 12 miles.

3/22/17:
Planned on the next two days being big hikes. Hiked all morning on
flat ground, and had 10 miles in by noon. After lunch, we were
hiking the High Point Trail, then down to Dickey Gap by mid
afternoon. We passed 10-12 north bound hikers over the days hike. We
pushed into Hurricane Mt. Shelter by 5PM for a 19 mile day. My right
knee is not doing as well as my left.

3/23/17:
It was cold last night, down around 20 degrees. This is the big hike
day for we are going over the hump. On the trail at first light. We
covered the 7 miles to Pine Mountain Trail by noon. This is the shortcut we get to take for our 2/20/17 day hike. This cuts off 8 miles of
trail for us. It did not cut off the 1,470' hike up a trail of rocks
that we had to take to the top of Pine Mt. Then came the trail of all
rocks up Mt. Rogers, at 5,729' it is the highest point in the state
of Virginia. Down a little, then back up to White top Mt. The second
highest point in Virginia. The last 5 miles of the day were all down
hill, into Last Mountain Shelter, which my right knee was not liking
at all. We saw other hikers all day. We covered 20.4 miles this day.

3/24/17:
Up with the sun, and on the trail around 8 AM. An easy hike day, made
even more so by our 2/24/17 day hike. We picked up the Virginia
Creeper Trail and hiked it into Damascus VA for a 16 mile day.

3/25/17:
Back in Abingdon VA where I need to finish packing and move my things
to Toledo for storage. My friend Dave Ziems will be taking me back to
Pearisburg VA on 4/9/17, for the next part of the hike.","Atkins VA (I81)
",Damascus VA,"Mar 26, Sun",75.30
Stillbill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560148,"4/9: I missed the trailhead and I
ended up starting my hike a couple of miles to the west of my planned
send off point. I spent the night at Jenny Knob shelter with two
north bound hikers.
4/10: On the trail with the sun, I
hiked 12 miles to Bland VA. The town is about 4 miles south of the
trail so I got a lift from a local into town by hitchhiking, which
was the first time that I have done that in about 40 years. I stayed
at the Big Walker Motel for the night.
Story of the day: Free coke from a
trail angel
Coming off the trail to head to Bland
VA, I was on the east side of the road and stopped to look at my data
book to understand where I was going from there. It looked like a
family was on the other side of the road enjoying dinner. The “dad”
came across the road to invite me to join them for a soda pop. When
I did join them, they were not a family, but a group of hikers and he
was a trail angel just giving out soda pops. This was my first trail
magic.  
Story of the day: Hotel room not
made.
When I got to the Big Walker Motel,
the only employees there were both doing house cleaning. They both
stopped to help check me in and gave me the room that they were
cleaning at that time. When I left the office, the two decided to
take a break. I went to the room that had no bedding or towels in it,
and just sat down in the only chair in the room. 20 minutes later the
two came to my room and did not know why I was there. After I told
them that this was the room they gave me, they apologized over and
over. I told them that if they would leave the room just as it was,
it would still be the best place that I slept on the trail to date.
4/11: On the trail early again, and
hiked 16 miles to the St. Luke's Hostel for $20. Rain is coming.
4/12: It rained most of the night, I
made a good call on being inside for the night. It was a big UP
coming out of Burkes Garden Va which is in Medley Valley. By the time
I did the 15 miles to Knot Maul Branch shelter my legs were done. I
very much needed a zero day, but cannot do one yet due to the upcoming Easter holiday weekend. There were 14 other hikers at the
shelter site with me. I slept in my tent.","Pearisburg VA

Stillbill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562584,"Story of the day: How I became
Stillbill
As I was hiking along the trail, a
hiker coming the other way stopped to talk and he asked me my trail
name, which I replied that I did not have one and was still going by
my real name of Bill. I do not think that he understood what I was
saying, for as he turned around to leave he said “Stillbill have a
good hike”. As he walked away, I thought, well I have just been
named. One word, not two.
4/13: Up and moving before the sun. I
MUST do 15 miles to Atkins VA today. There is a 10 AM Friday
Greyhound that I must be on. My legs have nothing left in them to do
15 miles. Where this part of the hike ends for me is a Mexican
Restaurant with very good food. By mid afternoon I was about 1/4 of a
mile from the restaurant and could see it, but could not take one
more step. I had to stop and rest for about 15-20 min. before I could
walk over to the restaurant. I spent the night in Atkins. So far this
year, I have hiked 260 miles of the Appalachian Trail (AT).
4/14: I got to Greyhound in Marion VA
around 8 AM for the 10 AM bus to Roanoke, VA. The bus did not show
until after 11 AM. Had lunch in Roanoke and got a cab to Daleville
VA. I will stay at the Howard Johnson Express for Friday and Saturday
night at $50 per night.
I plan on being back on the trail Easter
Sunday. This time HEADING NORTH.
Story of the day: Ride to Greyhound
Checking into the hotel in Atkins VA,
I asked the desk clerk about how I could get a ride the 5 miles to
Greyhound in the morning. He told me that he could not help me. Just
then, the woman behind me asked if I was hiking the AT and I told her
yes. Well, this 80 something year old said that she and her husband
would take me, and for me to meet them in the morning. The next day,
on the way to the bus station, she told me that the two of them, and
they were both in their 80's were heading to the AT to do trail
maintenance. To this day, I do not know what those two could have done
work wise, but thanks for the ride. 
Story of the day: Man got off the bus
to go to McDonald's
The Greyhound bus only made one stop
going to Roanoke, VA and there was a McDonald's at that stop. The
driver told us that we could get off the bus, but that it would be
leaving in 17 minutes, if we were back on the bus or not. About 15
minutes later the driver came back on the bus and did a head count.
Everyone was accounted for. Just then a guy in his early 20's got up
to get off the bus, the driver asked him what he was doing, and he
said that he needed to go to McDonald's. She told him that the bus
was leaving in two minutes with or without him. He just said again,
that he needed to go to McDonald's. After he got off the bus, she
closed the door and we left. I always wonder what that guy was
thinking/doing as we pulled away.","Daleville VA

Extra zero day in Daleville, my legs were not ready to go.

4/17:
Left Daleville by 8 AM. Did 18 miles to Bobblets Gap shelter. Hiked
some of it with a 14 year old named Mountain Dew. 7 people in camp
tonight. Late in the evening a man named Norsemen came into camp. It
was a good hike day.

Story
of the day: Changed in front of 2 women

I
do not recall why, but when I got into camp I needed to change what I
was wearing right away into my night wear. There were only two women
there and they told me that they would turn around while I changed.
Standing at the picnic table I stripped naked to change and just then
both of them turned back at me. Just a note here, men do not expect
and do not receive any privacy on the trail. Women get as much
privacy as can be provided. 

4/18:
Hiked 14 miles to Bryant Ridge shelter. A good hiking day. The
shelter holds 20 people, I was the only one there this night. Rain
started about 9 PM.

Story
of the day: A family embarrassment.

Before
I started this hike, I had told my Mom and siblings that I hope that
I wouldn't embarrass them with my hike performance. Everyone told me that was not possible. Tonight in camp, I was looking at my
data book and figured out that I had now hiked 300 miles. I sat back
and thought, well that is not a family embarrassment. Three other
hikers that I have met along the way have told me that their hiking
partner had quit on the very first day. Now that is a family
embarrassment. 

4/19:
It rained all night and into the evening this day. It was in the
upper 30's with rain, fog, and a good wind blowing. I did 10 miles
that included a 4,200' climb up Thunder Hill. Hiked most of the day
with Bear Meat. Peace Walker came into camp late. She and Bear Meat
slept in their tents. I slept in the shelter with a few mice.

4/20:
15 miles mostly downhill into Glasgow, VA. Only one climbed,  700'  over High Clock Knob. This was a very steep up and down, very hard. I had
hiked with Peace Walker until then. She just pulled away from me on
this hill. That woman has trail legs. Crossed the James River on the
longest footbridge on the AT. There were 9 hikers that stayed at the
town's Pavilion with me. It rained a couple of times overnight.

Story
of the day: 4 hiker swimming

I
knew that we all needed a good shower, but when I saw 4 hiker's
swimming in a very cold James river, I knew that they must have been
smelling even worse than me.

4/21:
It was very easy getting a ride back to the trail with Wild Flower. I
hiked 22 miles to Buena Vista, VA. It was a good day for a hike.

Story
of the day: hitchhiking with Wild Flower

I
did not know WildFlower because she was in a group of hikers that came
into town after I did. Anyone would notice how beautiful she was. In
the morning the two of us were ready to head back to the trail at the
same time. The trail being a few miles away meant that we would
hitchhike. When we got to the road, she put her thumb out and because
she is one beautiful woman, every car on the road stopped, and all we
had to do was pick one. Now that is how you do it.","Waynesboro VA

I was planning on taking one zero day in Buena Vista VA, but with a
very heavy rainstorm due in 4/23, I added a 2nd zero day. It
rained all evening.

4/23:
Looking for 4-4.5"" of rain this day. The rain had stopped in the
early morning and did not start again until evening. Conversation at
the Food Lion - Cashier to me: Are you hiking the AT? Me: Yep.
Cashier: You must not be very bright? Me: Yep.

4/24:
It rained all night. Rain should have ended early morning. I got a
shuttle back to the trail at 9 AM. From late morning to late
afternoon, the rain was very heavy. I hiked 14 miles to
Seeley-Woodworth shelter. Even with my rain suit, I was dripping wet
from head to toe, inside and out. There were 4 of us in the shelter,
and it was a cold night.

4/25:
It rained all night, plus we are in a fog bank. Everything I was
wearing for today's hike was still very wet and now cold. I hiked up
about 4,100' to the top of ""The Priest"". Taking a photo
there is a must, but it was still raining and adding the fog bank. The
only photo is of me standing in my rain gear. I hiked back down ""The
Priest"" to the Crab tree Falls campground for a 12 mile day. I
spent the night in a $50 log cabin, Well, at least I'm out of the
rain.

Story
of the day: I do not know my name

Now
the full story about the log cabin at CrabTree Falls. When I got
down from the “Priest” I needed to go about a mile up the road to
get to the Crab-tree Falls campgrounds. I was again in very bad shape
and thinking of walking there was not a good thought. Hitchhiking, a
man stopped just to tell me that no one was going to give me a ride,
and that the road was unsafe to walk on. After he did all the talking
for a few minutes he told me to get in and that he would take me to
the campgrounds. Entering the campgrounds front office I can tell you
that I was sub-human. My IQ by this time was 20 to 25, pushing 20. I
did not know my name and could not get my ID or credit card out to
check in. I could only mumble heat – heat. After the owner did all
the work to get me checked in, he led me back to my log cabin in
which there was only a full size bed with no sheets on it, a small
wood table in a corner and a wood bench in front of the table. As the
owner closed the door, windows, and turned on the heat, I just sat on
the bench looking like pure misery. (I now wish I would have had him
taken a photo of me then). So over the next hour, I found the
campgrounds shower and took a long hot one and put on my night wear.
Then ringing out my hiking wear and hunging them around the cabin to
dry. After I was acting like a human being again, I went back up to
the front office to get some comfort food. I'm sure that I was not
the first hiker to come into this place like I did, but the owner
still had to wonder who this “new” person was talking to him.

4/26:
The rain stopped overnight. The owner of the campgrounds gave me a
lift back to the trail. I had a very hard hike up the 4,000' Three
Ridges Mountain. But after a 10 mile day, I stayed at the Devil's
Backbone Brewpub, where hikers get to camp for free. Some of the
hikers stayed up drinking all night. I was not in that group.","Buena Vista

I was up and moving early for a 14 mile day. The overlook view at
Cedar Cliffs is world class. The shelter at Paul Wolfe was very nice,
but I needed to use my tent to dry it out. It rained again during the
night.

4/28:
Only had a 5 mile hike into Waynesboro, VA, which is at the south
gate of the Shenandoah National Park. I will be waiting here until
Monday to see my sister Chris and my Brother in Law Chris. I decided
to stay at the Stanimals Hostel. The first person to greet me was
Peace Walker, it was great to see her again. She and I went out to
dinner and a drink together. We ran into Norseman, and she introduced
me to a man named Crazy Tree.

4/29:
Zero day. Updated my log book and re-supplied. Peace Walker and all
the other hikers at the Hostel moved on. I'm just short of 400 total
miles.
4/30:
One of the hikers that came in last night was a man named Rooster. Him
and I slackpacked (That is when you take almost everything out of
your backpack, only leaving what you need for this hike) from Black
Rock Gap in the Shenandoah National Park south back to Waynesboro
which is a 22 mile hike. It was a good hike day with my backpack only
at 13 pounds. My normal weight is around 35 pounds. I stayed another
night at Stanimals Hostel, 11 hikers spent the night there.

Story
of the day: Meeting Stealth

Since
I was the only hiker at the hostel that was there from the day
before, I was now the old man of the place. Just sitting in a chair,
a man older than me sat next to me and asked if there were any
restaurants down the road by Kroger, and I told him about a place
that I had gone to. This was the first time that I met Stealth.

5/1:
Zero day. I moved from the hostel to the Comfort Inn where I met up
with Chris and Chris. The three of us had a great dinner at
Outback. I gave my sister all my winter gear to hold for me until
mid-July. I will need it back when I get to the White Mountains. In

After breakfast with Chris and Chris, Roster and I were shuttled back
to Black Rock Gap in the SNP. I hiked 22 miles to High Top Hut. It
was a VERY hard hike day, and my legs were very weak all day. I slept
in my tent tonight.

5/3:
On the trail at first light. My legs feel good. Hiked 21 miles to
Big Meadows campground where the Ranger told me that the only food
was one mile down the road and that they close in 30 minutes. After
hiking for 10.5 hours, I got to jog with my 35 pound backpack on the
mile to get a Hamburger. Roster was already there. Roster, Crazy Tree
and I all had our tents right by each other this night.

5/4:
It was cold and very windy last night. I slept in my tent and the
wind was an issue. I have been planning on spending a night at Sky
land resort and it was only an 8 mile hike. I had dinner with Roster
and 2 other hikers. Heavy rain is due in tonight.

5/5:
I’m glad that I went to Sky land Resort yesterday. I had a nice
room and good food. It rained very heavily all night. At breakfast it
looked like the front past, and the sun came out. I set out to hike
24 miles to Gravel Spring Hut. About a half an hour into the hike,
the rain came back. A cold rain then fell for the rest of the day. I
got to the shelter after dark and had to take a bath in the nearby
very cold stream to get the mud off of me before I got into my
sleeping bag.

Story
of the day: A Fall in the mud.

It
was raining and I needed to keep pushing forward to make my planned
miles for the day, but hiking on a trail of wet rocks is not fun. At
one point, I slipped on one of the rocks and went face first into the
muddy ground and a half second later my 35 pound backpack hit me,
again sending my face into the mud. As I was picking myself back up,
I noticed that where my face hit the ground was the only place around
where there were no rocks. Someone up stairs is looking out for me.","

of the day: Washed in full view of 3 woman

When
I got into camp I asked if there was any room in the shelter for me
and a young woman said yes. Then I asked her where the water was and
she pointed to it for me. I very much needed to clean up after my
fall in the mud that day, so I got my night wear out and went over
about 20 yards to the creek to wash up. The water from the creek was
very cold, but I could not get into my sleeping bag the way I was.
When it came right down to it, I needed to take a bath. So within
easy view of three women, off everything came, and I used my shirt as
my cleaning cloth to wipe off the mud, and when I was done, I put on
my night wear and went to the shelter to sleep.

5/6:
I was up by 6 am, and had to put on the same thing that I was wearing
yesterday that was still very wet and cold. The hike today was 13.5
miles in a cold rain to Front Royal VA, which is the northern gate of
Shenandoah N.P. I got the last room at the Super 8 motel.

Story
of the day: Front Royal – Motel or Hospital ?

Going
into Front Royal VA., I was a mess. Like most times that I
hitchhiked, I got a ride from a woman. The women asked me where I
wanted to go, and I told her the Super 8 motel. Just by the way she
was looking at me, I knew she was thinking should she take me to the
motel, or a hospital. 

Story
of the day: “That is not enough”

I
went out for dinner and to watch the Kentucky Derby. When my meal of
meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans which was of normal size
was put in front of me, I looked at it then turned to the server and
said “that is not enough”. I had to add an appetizer. After
dinner, she asked me if I was going to have dessert which is
something I never have. I looked at her and said of course.

Hiked 15 miles to Dicks Dome shelter. It was a good hike. On the way
there, I was closing in on the hiker in front of me, and just when I
was about to pass Matt, a south bound hiker met us coming the other
way. He was a Hare Krishna in full dress. What a scene. He knew the
lyrics of all three verses of “April Showers”. He did a nice job
on the song.

5/9:
There is a part of the trail called “The Roller Coaster” that is
13.5 miles of tightly packed ascents and descends. Early into it I
meet a hiker named The Joker. Him and I did 10 miles of it into the
Bears Den Hostel. This was built as a castle. There must have been
15-17 hikers there. The day’s total hike was 18 miles.

Story
of the day: “He's not going to make it”
 I
met a hiker named Papa who told me that he was going to spend the night at Sky Meadows State park. I pointed out that would require him to go
1.7 miles down the side of the mountain, and he said that he knew
that. The next morning just two miles into my hike, I came across
Papa sitting on a park bench totally spent after coming back up the
side of the mountain. After talking to him for a minute, I moved on
thinking “he not going to make it”. For the next 16 days I was
always running into/around/camping with Papa, and it was always a
great time. PaPa did make it, he thru-hiked the AT. May the best
of luck always be with you.

Story
of the day: The Bears den Hostel

The
Joker and I came into the Bears den first with Matt about an hour
behind us. Much to my surprise, Papa come in later. The Bears den is
a castle- like stone lodge hostel that is owned by the ATC. All
hostels are better than sleeping in the mud, but this was a little
over sold. The Joker and I were put in the basement bunk house where
someone was snoring very loud all night. The Joker is very much an anti snoring person and was very upset in the morning about the
noise. I asked him as a side note if I snored, and he said
“Stillbill, you do not make a sound”. How something change.

5/10:
A nice day for a 20 mile hike and to finish up the roller coaster. I
got to cross my first state line today VA – WV. I was with Matt and
the Joker at the time. I got into Harper Ferry WV in the evening and
met up with Matt for dinner.","

of the day: Read the riot act

Matt
and I come across a teenager just sitting on a rock on the side of
the trail. He was wearing a cotton T-shirt, cotton jeans, and cotton
Converse shoes. He only had with him, a big yellow sleeping bag and a
plastic bag that you would get from a grocery store with some food in
it. Matt though he was 16, and I was thinking 18 years old. He told
us that he had just gotten on the trail by Harper Ferry and was
planning on hiking south to GA. I knew that rain was coming the next
two days and at these temperatures this kid was going to be in very
big trouble. He knew zero about the trail or how it works except that
it went to GA. I do not think that I said a kind word to this
teenager. I would say that I read him the riot act. You do not wear
any cotton on the AT for it does not dry, and he had no change of
clothes.. I asked what he was planning on doing with his food at
night, and he said that he would keep it in his sleeping bag, which
would bring the bears also into his sleeping bag. Which would
endanger him and everyone else around him. He told me that I should
try living like a bum, and I answered back that whatever he was
running from will look like peanuts within 48 hours. After talking to
him, Matt and I headed up the trail. A few minutes later Matt said to
me “I do not think that he is going to die out here”, I answered
back, you're right, he is not going to die, he will just wish he would.

5/11:
A zero day. As planned, Matt was heading home today, so I walked
around Harper Ferry in a cold rain.

5/12:
Due to more heavy rain that was due in, I added another zero day in
Harper Ferry. This was not part of my plan.","

Cold rain due to end around noon. I left the hotel at 8 am to walk
the mile to where I could pick up a shuttle to where I left the trail
in lower Harper Ferry. I stopped at the Weverton Cliffs for the view
and lunch. In came Crazy Tree, and the man named Stealth who I have
met a few times. The trail was water, mud and rocks. Many times all
three. I entered the state of Maryland today. The three of us
finished up a 16 mile day at a new shelter called Rocky Run, and it was
very nice.

5/14:
It rained from 6 to 7 am. The three of us were on the trail shortly
after 7 am for a 20 mile day. There was a lot of history on the hike
today. Maryland’s Washington Monument and a monument for all war
reporters killed in action. I had lunch at Annapolis rocks (very nice
view), and ended up at Raven Rock Shelter with about 20 other hikers.
It was a fun time, but it was “light's” out at 9 pm. The trail
today was ROCKS, ROCKS, ROCKS, and ROCKS.
Story
of the day: “Get up and do what you must do”

A
few of the younger hikers lined themselves up to do the four state
challenge (VA,WV,MD,PA – 43 miles in one day). That is a whole lot
of miles. Stealth, Crazy Tree and I were done for the night in our
sleeping bags when “the Machine” came into camp saying he could
not go the few miles more to complete the challenge. The women in
camp were encouraging him on. “The Machine” finally said that he
was not going to move until two people kissed him and he didn't care
which two. The next thing you hear is Stealth to Crazy Tree – “get
up and do what you must do” I was laughing out loud. Ended up that
a girl and one guy kissed him with Crazy Tree taking a photo of it.
“The Machine” then headed back out on the trail to complete the
challenge.

5/15:
A short 7.2 mile hike into Waynesboro, PA. 5 miles in, I crossed the
Mason-Dixon Line. I am now in Pennsylvania. My shoes are starting to
fall apart.

5/16:
Getting back to the trail was not fast this morning. I was looking
for a ride for about an hour. Hiked 25.6 miles into Birch Run

of the day: Two men with a total IQ under 100

Coming
into the shelter that I was planning on stopping for the night at,
there were two men already there. After about two minutes I knew that
together their total IQ was under a 100 and that staying there would
end up being a big mistake. I told them that I was only stopping for
dinner and water and needed to keep moving. Great plan, for when I
got to the next shelter Papa was there and he told me that is exactly
what he did.

5/17:
Hiked 20.3 miles into Mt. Holly Springs, PA where I met up with
Norsemen at the Holly Inn. Very nice place for $50 a night. I need
new shoes right now.

5/18:
Hiked 23.1 miles in open country, was all sun and in the 90’s. I
stopped in Boiling Springs, PA for lunch and to get out of the
heat/sun for 5 hours. I also got a new pair of shoes that are made to
hike in the rocks.

5/19:
Hiked 11.3 miles into Duncannon, PA to the Doyle Hotel. It is a thru
hikers rite of passage to stay in this hell hole of a place. One
beer, and the room was $25, and that was a little too much to pay for
this place. The place was full of hikers and I had a good time. At 1
am, the local fire Dept. set off their city wide alarm. It sounded
like that thing was in my room.","

Hiked 16.1 miles with Papa and Stealth to a campsite. During the
hike, I went down hard in the rocks. My left foot fell between some
rocks and went down about a foot and a half. I was down for a good
minute before I could get my backpack off and get back up. It was a
good ten minutes before I was back up to full speed again. There was
a military field firing range close by and they were firing the big
guns late. Papa is ex-special force and we had a great conversation
about the big guns.

5/21:
My plan today was to hike 26.3 miles to the William Penn shelter that
holds 16 people because it is to rain tonight. Mid-day I was told that
there are about 25 hikers in front of me also going there to get out
of the rain. That was very bad news for me. Right after that I met a
woman name Boo Boo who was going to go into Lickdale, PA that night
to get out of the rain and I joined her. After a 19 mile day, she and
I had dinner together in Lickdale.","

of the day: Boo Boo and I must be husband and wife

After
Boo Boo and I met, we hiked together the few miles to the highway
that went to Lickdale, PA. When we got to the road, we were not sure
which way the town was, so we got a map out. Just then a guy asked us
if we needed a ride and we both said sure. Boo Boo sat in the back
with me up front. On the way to town, the guy said something to me
about my wife Boo Boo and we both corrected him. Getting to the
hotel, Boo Boo checked in first with me standing next to her, when
she was done, I said to the desk clerk that I also needed a room, and
she answered back that she put us both in the same room because she
thought we were husband and wife. After cleaning up, Boo Boo and I
walked about a half mile down the road to a restaurant for dinner,
again, the server said something about Boo Boo and I being married.
This was all within a few hours.

5/22:
Boo Boo stayed in Lickdale for a zero day. I hiked 17 miles to a
campsite. The trail was a lot of rocks today.

5/23:
Hiked 18.8 miles on a very rocky trail to Hamburg, PA. Norsemen
already had gotten a motel room that he and I split.

Story
of the day: Down the hill with Power House

Coming
up to Hamburg, I was hiking with a woman named Power House. This
little German woman has only taken one zero day to date and was not
stopping in Hamburg like everyone else. She must be a better human
being then me. She nor I had noticed in the data book that there was
going to be a big down just before we got to town. It was a hard one,
I was just glad It was not going up it. By the time I got to the
bottom, I needed to rest, and a few minutes later, Power House joined
me. As I was happy to get into a town for a zero day, she, as planned,
just kept putting one foot in front of the other.","

of the day: Buy me a drink?

After
Power House and I parted ways, I needed to hitchhiked the few miles
from Port Clinton PA, to Hamburg PA. The first car to come by stopped
to pick me up. The woman told me she was a trail angle and asked if I
had a problem if she stopped at the Post Office so she could get her
mail, and of course I said that it would be no problem. When she came
out of the Post Office, she told me the bar right across the street
was her hang out and she wanted to know if I would buy her a drink.
One look at her and I knew she was not talking about just one drink,
so I told her sorry but I could not and asked her again about the
ride to Hamburg PA. She was not happy, but off we went. 

5/24:
Zero day. Stealth and I meet Papa and his wife Mary for lunch. Papa
is now going to Maine to start being a south bounder. I should meet
him again in southern Maine. Boo Boo came in late afternoon, and we
had dinner at the hotel together.

Total
miles to date are 749.4

5/25:
It rained most of the night and a good part of this day, so I added
another zero day along with Stealth, Norsemen and Boo Boo. Norsemen,
Boo Boo and I went out (we got a ride) for lunch.

5/26:
Hiked 14.5 miles to Eckville Shelter. This shelter has a flush toilet
and that’s a big deal. There were 8 of us there including Norsemen,
Boo Boo and I.

5/27:
Hiked 17.4 miles .11 miles in is where “the Rocks” start. For the
next 50 miles, the trail is rocks. Big rock climbs were at The
Knife’s Edge, Bear Rocks, and Bake Over. I am starting to count my
fears. I did manage to get to Bake Over Knob shelter very late with
Norsemen. Boo Boo stopped a few miles back.

Story
of the day: Just one question, what day is it?

Norsemen
and I had set up camp when a dad and his teenage daughter came to
camp with us. After dinner I asked her when they decided to do this
few day hike, and she told me that it was Wednesday when they
decided. I looked at her and said that I only have one question, what
day is today, for I had no idea.

5/28:
Planning a 23.5 mile day. The trail is all rocks. Just past
Palmerton, PA I had to climb over Le-high Gap which is a very rocky,
steep trail. All my fears started bubbling up as I went over the top
of this one. I managed to make 18 miles, but that was a very good
day. Just as I was going into my tent about 7 pm, a little rain
started. A side note. I met a couple today who gave Norsemen and I
apples, and the man asked me if I was Stillbill from Trail Journals.
He has been reading my post. Thanks for the apple.","

of the day: I do not need deodorant anymore.

Knowing
that I was going to meet up with my sister Chris in Dayton Ohio, I've
been thinking about what I can give her to lighten up my backpack. I
need to do this to carry more food and water. My self protection
knife was the first thing on my list. Peace Walker had told me that
she was not carrying a knife because if you can't kill a bear with the
first strike, you are only going to make that bear very mad at you.
Next came my deodorant. I'm sweating from every pore in my body and
not taking very many baths, so I do not see how deodorant is helping
me go to Maine. After reviewing everything in my pack, I cut my base
weight by 3 pounds, and that is a big deal.

5/29:
I did not know that rain was expected. It rained all night with the
heaviest of the rain coming between 6-10 am. I did not get back on
the trail until 11 am. My tent is just mud. After a 10.6 mile day, I
met back up with Norseman to stay at Wind Gap, PA.

Story
of the day: Norseman and I eat at Wendy's
Norseman
asked me if I wanted to go to Wendy's to eat and I said sure. I
ordered two double cheeseburgers and a side salad along with a diet
coke. After I ate all of this and washed it down with 5 or 6 cokes, I
got up and went back up to the counter and ordered a chicken sandwich
which I also ate. A hiker's appetite at it best.

5/30:
It rained all day; I hiked 16 miles to Delaware Water Gap, PA, which
is on the PA – NJ border. I did have to go over 1,500’ Mt Minsi
with all the rock wet. More fears were bubbling up.

Here
is where I stopped to go to Dayton, OH for my nephew Mike’s
wedding. 825 miles of trail are now behind me. I will be back on the
trail Tuesday June 6th
with my friends Dave and Jim Buchele. They will be hiking with
me for about a week.

of the day: Boo Boo asks about the Pocono inn

I
was coming into Delaware Water Gap, PA, and Boo Boo sent me a text
saying that she was going to stay at the Deer Head Inn there. I
stopped at the Inn but it was closed, so I let Boo Boo know that I
was going to stay at the Pocono Inn. Ends up she was a day behind me.
The Deer Head was also closed for her, and she wanted information on
the Pocono Inn for they did not answer the phone. I told her not to
stay there but
She
said she was desperate to get clean and dry. She was also happy that
she could do her laundry there. You have to see this place to
understand what is going on there. The Inn is undergoing a major
renovation and more than 75% of the room are not in use. Also the
restaurant, bar, conference rooms, and laundry are closed, and the
parking lot that you see coming into the inn is also undergoing work
and is empty. After Boo Boo checked in, she named the Inn the Walking
Dead Motel, and barricaded her door for the night.","

We dropped Jim’s car 50 trail miles ahead and returned my rented
car, so we did not get to the trail until noon. We hiked 10.5 miles
to Mohican Outdoor Center where we got a cabin for the night. The
trail today had a lot of rocks. It was very hard for me to return to
the trail after being off it for a week.

6/7:
We hiked 21 miles to The Gren Anderson shelter. Just a great day for
a hike. I was still not happy about coming back out, but was feeling
good by the end of this day's hike. The trail had a lot of rocks, but
tomorrow we turn east away from the rocks. A hiker named Fog came
into the shelter late. Met a young woman named Captain Kirk and her
boyfriend.

6/8:
We hiked 18.4 miles on a great day. I’m back into hiking. The trail had a lot of rocks going into High Point State Park, which is the
highest point in NJ, there is a really nice 220’ tower there. Right
after the park, the trail turned east and the amount of rocks
decreased by 80-90%. We spent the night on Jim Murray field. His
phone number was on a card there and we called him up and asked if we
could stay. He told us yes at no cost, and that the water there was
good.

Story
of the day: Snack for Dave

When
we got to the tower at High Point State Park, we stopped for a much
needed break. I had been carrying a snack with me just for Dave. Not
showing him what I had, I told him that he needed to use his spoon to
eat it, Dave replied back that he was not going to eat any dehydrated
ice cream, and I told him to not make me tell him again to get his
spoon out, which he did. I handed him a sandwich bag with white
matter in it, he looked at it with no idea of what it was. Opening
it, he tasted it and got a big smile on his face. I had taken a
family size bag of potato chips and pulverized it in a blender until
it was nothing but fine particles.

I
had left Jim Miller a phone message about us wanting to stay in his
field, and we were waiting for a call back when his two donkeys came
walking over to us from a nearby barn. I take it they only wanted to
say hi and check us out, for after a 10-15 minute visit they both
returned to the barn. When Jim called me back, I told him about the
donkey's and he told me not to worry because they are not going anywhere.

car. It was another great day for a hike. About two miles into the
hike, we stopped in Unionville, NY for lunch. Fog and Crazy Tree
were there. I told Crazy Tree how hard it had been to come back, and
that I needed Dave and Jim to make me come back. Crazy Tree told Dave
and Jim “Stillbill belongs on this trail, so thanks for bringing
him back”. We made a 2nd stop in Vernon, NJ for some late afternoon
ice cream, and a little rest before we went up Wawayanda Mountain,
which is known as the “Stairway to Heaven”. It is a mountain of
rocks.

6/10:
Hiked 10.1 miles to Bellville, NY. Four miles in we officially
crossed into New York. We climbed up what is called “the Ladder”. At the top, Jim turned back to move the car from Wawayanda park to
Bellville, NY. After the Ladder, the trail ran along the crest line
and was all BIG rocks which you have to climb over. This went on for
around a mile. We ended up staying the night at the Breezy Point Inn
in Greenwood, NY for a great last night together.

6/11:
The heat is going to be on for 3 days. Dave and Jim dropped me off at
the trailhead after lunch, and I hiked 2 hard miles to the Wildcat
shelter where I stopped for what is called a nearo day. That is a day
with close to zero miles. Today was in the 90’s. One of the hikers
that came into camp was a man named Ketchup.

6/12:
A very hot day. I hiked 19.9 miles to William Brien shelter. I was on
the trail at 5 am to hike 14 miles by noon, and then sit the midday
sun out and hike again in the evening. Like all the other hikers I
got damaged in the heat and did not get to the shelter until 3 pm to
find that it was closed due to bear on human contact, so I had to
keep going. I had to go through what is called “The lemon squeezer”
which is a hard rock climb with no energy in my legs. By the time I
got into camp, with Ketchup, I was in very bad shape.

of the day: Drinking a gallon of water
By
early afternoon I was not doing well and was consuming water at an alarming rate. As I came up to a road, a trail angel had put about 40
one gallon jugs
of
water in the woods for hikers to use. I took one jug and filled my
water containers and drank the rest. Getting ready to move on, I
decided that I had not drunk enough water yet, so I opened a fresh
gallon and without stopping drank the whole thing.

Story
of the day: “I not going to rat you out”

Coming
up to a road that a deli was on, I was planning to stop for lunch. I
see Ketchup coming south across the road at me. I called out to him
that he was headed in the wrong direction, he laughed and said that he
had crossed the road going north at the deli, and needed to “clean
up” this missed part of the trail. That is a purest for you. I told
him that there was not a chance in hell that I would do a clean up
like that. Ketchup laughed, and said for me not to worry because he was
not going to rat me out.

6/13:
I left the shelter at 5:15 am and the first thing I had to do was
climb up about 50 yards of rocks. About 40 yards into the climb, I
looked up to see that I was heading right to a bear. The bear was
about 10 yards in front of me just sitting there looking at me. My
heart stopped for a half a second, but then I was okay. I was sure
that due to the poor eyesight that black bears have, it would not come
down into the rocks to me. I had to stand up so that I could get my
phone out to turn it on so that I could take a photo. This is the
part that no one will believe. I asked the bear if he was going to
wait there until I got a photo. The bear went up on its two back legs
where I could see just how big it was. Black bears do that for two
reasons. 1) To get a better look at you. 2) To smell you. I had not
taken a shower in a few days and with this heat I’m sure it ran
away after it smelled me. I also did not get a photo. So I hiked 10.2
miles into Fort Montgomery, NY. It was another very hot day. I have
no legs to hike.

Hiked 21.2 miles into Kent, CT on a hot day. I crossed the NY-CT
border along the way. There was to be no rain today, so you got
it….It rained very hard all afternoon. The whole time it was
raining, the trail was all rocks with imposing abrupt ups and downs.
Let me tell you, there is no happiness when dealing with a rocky tail
in the rain. For a few hours in the rain, I was hiking with a woman
named Rocket Fuel, but she stopped for safety issues. By the time I
got to Kent, I must have looked like a wet cat that had been hit by a
truck. On my way back to the motel after dinner, I ran into Wonder
Women so we had a drink for her birthday.

Note:
I’m not saying that the water in the state of New York is not safe,
but none of it looked or tasted any good.

can also report that I have no legs to hike with.
