Kristine Boutte,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553611,"It's all setting in.Three Saturdays from now we'll be embarking on the greatest adventure of our lives. Throwing all caution to the wind and doing what others regret never having done or wish they had the mental or physical fortitude to do. That's right folks, we just up and decided that we are going to thru hike the AT. Why? Because we can. No seriously, why the hell would anyone want to walk 2200 miles? I'm not sure but I'm willing to find out.","

Kristine Boutte,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553660,"Today we took REIs AT thru hiking comprensive course. Although informative, the only thing I learned from this course is that I am as ready as I'm going to be. I am working on my Appalchian Trials exercises because the concensus is that mental preparation is the key to success. Reinforced again in this course.""Why do I want to hike the AT?"" is the nagging question. If I'm 100% honest I'm doing this for my husband. It's been his dream since he was a boy scout to make this physically daunting trek. Due to rigorous measures to remove cancer, the age of his knee is beyond his physical years and waiting for retirement isn't an option. Now is the time. Besides, I generally operate under the assumption that my time here will be short because I'm a self proclaimed pessimist. So, yolo!","Antisipation Station

Kristine Boutte,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553837,"My last week of work has been bitter sweet. First and foremost, I'm elated at the thought of not making that dreadful commute or smelling the stinky water treatment plants five days a week. Yuk! And there are so many reasons why I'm happy to leave my job but this isn't about that. This is about the overwhelming support and encouragement I've received from my clients as they learned of my departure and my plan to hike the AT. I thought saying good bye was going to be easy but I've formed bonds with these people. How could I have been so non-chalant? I've seen them through having children, losing partners and normal day to day banter which usually lightened an otherwise heavy or stressful day. I'd cry, but I'm way too excited. Instead, I'll friend them all so I don't really have to say goodbye. I love you all. Thank you for making me feel so appreciated.","

Kristine Boutte,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554641,"It was so nice getting to start the trail with family but bittersweet saying goodbye. I learned that my Grandfather may not make it to see us finish which made saying goodbye more emotional. Life is so short and this is why we have decided to do this now instead of waiting for retirement. Tomorrow is never guaranteed.
We started strong and made it to our campsite super early. The site was really nice with a bear box and a privy. We were slow setting up and our first meal was a wash so we went to bed hungry.","Springer Mountain

Kristine Boutte,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554643,"Today we learned a valuable lesson about water management. Don't wait until the next watersource and if a fellow hiker offers you a liter of water, TAKE IT! We hiked Sassafrass with no water and just as we were about to break our cardinal rule (NEVER LEAVE YOUR WINGMAN) we happened across the tiniest trickle of water which we monopolized on. Chuck was so thirsty that when I made a joke about filtering my pee he actually considered it! Anyone who knows Chuck knows that he must've been REALLY thirsty. With that said, because I hike a little stronger and although thirsty still had the energy to hike ahead and get water. Thankfully we didn't have to do that though. The water rejuvenated us and we hiked strong to Devil's Kitchen campsite. We intended to make it to Gooch Gap but the thirst slowed us down and Sassafrass kicked our ass. We were very efficient setting up camp and after learning from our mistake the night before I cooked Spanish rice which turned out great. We put velveeta cheese sauce on a tortilla with the rice and made burritos. It was delish!","Hawk Mountain

Kristine Boutte,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554646,"Brr, cold start this morning. Knowing we had some miles to make up we got an early start. We broke down camp quick and enjoyed a hot cup of g7 coffee before hitting the trail. We both packed food that we could eat while hiking and made excellent time. It was warm enough Just when we thought we couldn't go any further we made it to Lance Creek campsite that we later discover was our intended destination. High fives and adaboys to us!","Devil's Kitchen

Kristine Boutte,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555869,"I've been slacking on my journal updates, haven't I? I'm sorry y'all!We are 3 weeks in now and so much has happened, I'm not sure where to start.Alright, we stayed at Mountain Crossings hostel for 2 nights after summiting Blood Mountain and waited for some cold and nasty weather to pass. Our supply box was way over loaded so we made a generous deposit to the Hiker box which was enjoyed by many hikers. We received our first trail magic from Grateful and his girlfriend Deathzone. We left the hostel early the second morning and hiked in the coldest weather to date. It was so cold my snot froze! Yuk.We've been fairly lucky timing zeros based on inclement weather but after a few days, we ran into some rain at the Cheese Factory where we took another zero and caught up on rest. Since we had cell reception and 4g we were pretty content. We were staying put waiting on a visit from family but life happened so we quickly moved on and did our first big day at 12 miles. We pushed ourselves to get to Hiawasee for resupply and a much deserved and needed shower at the Budget Inn. We smelled pretty rank to put it nicely. We ran into our new trail family Brady and Becca (later known as The Brady Bunch) there as they were heading out. We experienced the beginning of hiker hunger in Hiawasee and together we consumed a dozen taco bell tacos, 3 bean burritos and an order of nachos followed by a salad at zaxbys and a veggie sub at subway. Sometime later we crossed the NC border that seemed like an eternity to reach and reunited again with the Brady Bunch who today we consider ""Tramily"" or trail family. We talked for a while that night and got to know one another and shared real names instead of trail names. We would spend the next week and a half leap frogging with them.We pushed ourselves again to get into Franklin and did 13.7 miles. We received more trail magic from a sweet old man called Intents after arriving by shuttle to the Haven Budget Inn in Franklin. We were immediately greeted by this kind Trail Angel who took us to Shoney's. An all you can eat buffet for a thru hiker is like hitting the jackpot in Vegas. Just remember that what happens at the buffet stays at the buffet. I gorged on salad and veggies and anything else I could fit in my belly. He took us to Outdoor 76 where I got a pack shakedown and foot analysis. We were also shopping for a new tent that would give us more room and would be more efficient in the rain we were bound to deal with moving forward.The weather finally caught up with us as we were approaching the NOC and we were soaked to the bone when we stayed in our first shelter, Wesser Bald Shelter. We learned a 2 valuable things at this shelter. #1 always check your pockets and remove all food trash. A hiker hung his wet shorts on a line and failed to remove food trash from his pockets and awoke to find a hole in his pocket. #2 is to add instant potatoes to Knorr rice or noodle sides to add calories and beef it up.
The climb to Cheoah Bald was very difficult but the view from the top was fantastic. We basked in the sun and had a nice lunch witb the Brady Bunch. We decided to take a short day and camped at a nice site out of the wind because the lows at night made for 2 sleepless nights. We practically ran to Fontana and spent the night with the Brady Bunch at the "" Fontana Hilton"" shelter equipped with showers which is unheardof in a shelter. We departed from the Brady Bunch as they are skirting around the GSM park because dogs are not allowed. Bad weather was expected so wemade the decision to stay at the Fontana lodge where we enjoyed a refreshing stay and ate and showered to our hearts content. We depart today 3-8 into the Great Smokey Mountains. Our permit only allows 7 days to complete 80 miles of trail so we will have to be diligent. 
Will update again once we have wifi or data. Cheers!","Lance Creek Campsite

Kristine Boutte,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556216,"We left the Fontana Lodge on a beautiful day with temps near 70Â° after being spoiled with over budget accommodations. This has the norm so far on this trip unfortunately. Starting so early has definitely hurt the budget but it's to be expected after plucking ourselves from the city life and learning to live without certain luxuries. The hike was easy to the one and only tent campsite in the Smokies which was a little more than 5 miles in. This is a slack day for us but we didn't get on the trail until noon so not much we can do about that. I hiked with a tank top and probably could've gone without my tights but the weather is pretty unpredictable at such high elevations so better safe then sorry.Campsites were nice but we were on an incline which interrupts sleep. Well, more than the usual anyway. Great water source but no privacy in terms of bathroom needs. My new friend BooBoo has been the only other female thru hiker I've seen so far on the trail so the girl to guy ratio is pretty off-skew. That being said, privacy is important so I wait until dark to pee.","Fontana Hilton

I wear my tank again to keep my long sleeves dry for dropping temps rolling in. Looks like snow is in our forecast and dropping temps. That's the Smokies!Pretty much all we do today is climb up and down mountains. Killer leg confusion that you pay top dollar for in your local cross fit gym though. Problem is, it's leg day 8 hours a day!! We","
