Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553176,"Hi my name is John Garbo and I'm planning to start my NOBO thru hike on 3/13/17. I'm busy with trail prep right now which includes setting up my AT Hike Journal. I will only make journal entries when I have access to electricity. This is, in part to save from carrying additional battery weight but also to ""unplug"" from emails and other electronics while I'm out on the trail. More Later John",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Wed",0
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553226,"No one sets out on an adventure of this magnitude without having a fair amount of support from the home front. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge a few people in my life that are supporting my adventure.First and foremost, I would like to thank my wife, Debbie, for allowing me the time away from home and responsibilities to attempt this thru hike. Her support means she is shouldering extra work around the house, tending to our wonderful dog, Cassie, alone and providing support (both physical and spiritual), while I'm out on the trail. I could not have even thought of attempting this hike without her full support, and like so many times before in our 39 year marriage she has supported me and my crazy ideas all the way. My son Greg has also been very supportive and has agreed to hike to the top of Katahdin on my last day. I'm looking forward to summiting Katahdin with him in September.I would like to thank my sisters and brother, Barb, Denise, Jackie and Rod for their support as well. My share of looking after our 91 year old mother will now fall upon them and I appreciate their support of my hike. It is great to have you all as family. I would like to also thank all of my friends and co-workers who have supported and encouraged me over the past 2 years. Thanks, your support means a lot to me and you all often gave me the strength to continue on with my plans even during moments of self-doubt and fleeting bouts of sanity. I feel very blessed to be surrounded by such great family and friends and look forward to sharing my trail experiences with you through this journal.",,View Entry,"Jan 12, Thu",0
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553235,"Several people have asked me why I want to thru hike the AT given the discomfort, pain, physical challenges of the trail. I would have to say that my reasons have evolved over the time I have been planning this hike. The initial attraction was that I like to hike and thought it would a be fun adventure. As I did more research into what was actually involved I also realized that hiking the AT will be a life changing experience. Change is something I have always embraced throughout my life and hiking the AT is a continuation of that life-long commitment. On my walks around the neighborhood a marque outside a middle school reads, ""If it isn't a challenge, then it won't change you"". I think that about sums it up for me.I look forward to meeting the version of me that is waiting for me on top of Katahdin. I’m not exactly who I will find when I get there but one thing is for sure, he will have a longer beard.",,View Entry,"Jan 13, Fri",0
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553267,"As you can see below, I have chosen as my ""signature"" a phrase that our Scoutmaster, Mr. Gold, said to us as he made us ""police"" (clean up) the campsite after we broke camp prior to leaving for home. One or another of the scouts (often me) would complain as we were policing the area that a certain piece of trash was already there when we arrived. His unwavering answer was, ""You always leave your campsite better than you found it"". We did not necessarily appreciate the fact that we were picking up other people's trash but we really did not understand the larger message there. What he was really saying is that you should always leave your world a better place. It wasn't until many years later that I realized that he taught me a lesson that I try to carry out everyday of my life.To that end I am challenging every reader of my Trail Journal to commit to performing one ""good deed"" or act of kindness each day that I'm on the trail. I have gotten into the habit of performing at least one good deed a day and it has changed my life for the better. I find myself looking for opportunities to help or intervene in someone's life in some small way. I find that I'm not as wrapped up in my own ""stuff"" and try to keep other's needs on my radar as well as my own.One of my fears while on the trail is that I will not have the opportunity to perform as many good deeds as I would like. This is why I am now asking for your help. If you can perform a good deed then the whole world will be a little better place. I would love to say that we have performed 10,000 good deeds by the time we reach Katahdin. If you think this is a good idea and are so inclined please ""join"" me by going to the guest book and letting me know you are interested in participating. Also, please feel free to share with the rest of us from time to time a good deed or two that you are exceptionally pleased with. Well, thank you for reading my journal and I hope that together we can all help make the world a little better place, for all of us.   John",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Sat",0
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554781,"I'm down to 23 days before we take off and I'm getting excited. Hitting the YouTube videos pretty hard to answer a few last minute questions, mainly around food and clothing. My gear is all packed and I just made my shopping list for food. I am going to try very hard to not bring too much food on this trip. I always bring much more food than I need and, of course, that means unnecessary extra weight. I'm sure that after a few weeks on the trail I'll have a better idea of how much food to bring. I did decide to bring my UV light for water purification. This replaces the Aquamira that I was going to bring. I will also bring some backup water purification tablets in case I have a SteriPen malfunction. The weight is about the same, I was concerned about finding replacement Aquamira while on the trail. I figured the SteriPen is more dependable. I will be sending out an email to all my friends and people who want follow my trip with a link to this blog about a week before I take off. Until next time.",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Fri",0
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554917,"I’ve received a lot of positive feedback regarding my suggestion for everyone to do a good deed everyday while I’m out on the trail. I am heartened by the great response to that suggestion and hope that many people will take up the challenge. I find that when you commit to performing at least one good deed every day you start to go through life with a different set of eyes and a new attitude. Where once you may have walked by a piece of trash on the ground and not give it a second thought you now see an opportunity to pick it up and make the street a little cleaner. I find that older people, pregnant women and mothers with little children often present an environment rich with “good deed” opportunity. Yes, the old cliché of the Boy Scout helping the little old lady across the street is alive and well. So, if you remain open to seeing opportunities to do your deeds, they abound.Interestingly though, one of my concerns while I’m out on the trail is a potential lack of opportunities for me to do a daily good deed. I will have to remain diligent to identify chances for me do my deed. My hiking partner, Pat, has suggested that I carry his pack as my daily good deed. I want to point out that there is point where altruism becomes masochism, I think that Pat’s suggestion may fall beyond that point.Oh well, I’m sure there will be many opportunities for me to perform my good deeds, I just hope there are lot of pregnant old ladies with children on the trail.      John",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Sat",0
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555809,"Three more days before I leave St. Louis then another three days until I hit the trail! I cannot wait and wish I were already out there. Unfortunately I will have to wait and while I am waiting I would like to acknowledge the huge outpouring of kindness, generosity and well wishes I have experienced over the last several months but especially over the past 2 weeks. My dance card has been filled with lunches, dinners and other get togethers with friends and family all wanting to wish me well and provide words of encouragement. I have been bought dinners, lunches and a drink or two. In addition I have received untold gifts of journals, compasses, a laundry washing kit, and many many more items. I did not expect this and quite honestly I’m overwhelmed by the love and support I am feeling right now. I will start my trek knowing that there are a lot of people rooting for me and I know I will fall back on that thought when the going gets tough from time to time. So, to all my friends, family and well-wishers thank you so much for your support. I hope that you enjoy following my blog over the next 6 months.   John",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Tue",0
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556398,"Deb, Linda, and Pat and I drove to the parking lot one mile from Springer Mountain the starting point for northbound thru hikers. We took some pictures and went back to the Amicalola Falls Lodge where we ate dinner and prepared for our first day of our hike. It was still dark when we woke up and looking over the valley we could see a full moon over a layer of clouds. It was a beautiful site and a great way to start the hike. I will miss Debbie, my friends and family but the next time I see you all I'll have many stories to share","

Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556401,Deb and Linda drove us back to the parking lot for us to start our hike. Since we already did the first mile yesterday we were able to take off from their. It was very windy and cold and our wives encouraged us to leave quickly so the could gather back in the warm car. We took off around 9:30 a.m. and headed to Hawk Mt. Shelter about 7.4 miles away. The hiking was pretty easy and we got there around 1:30 p.m. The shelter was already full so we had to pitch our tents. It was in the mid 30’s with the temp dropping and we stood around a fire trying not to go to bed too early. We tuned in around 7 and around 7:30 it started to rain. We met a father and son hiking a section of the trail while the son was on his spring break. They were both Eagle Scouts so we had a lot to talk about. There were 40 to 60 people camping in the area so it was pretty crude but when the sun went down you could hear a pin drop. I'm going to test my 12 degree bag in colder weather for the first time it is supposed to drop into the 20’s. That’s all for now but the adventure continues!,"Springer Mountain parking lot

Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556407,"Last night was a cold one but my bag kept me warm. We woke to 2 inches of snow today and it was pretty cold packing up. My fingers weren't working very well, a simple plastic clip becomes a real challenge. We were up and on the trail by 8:30, the best way to get warm is to get moving. The temp was predicted to drop to 14 degrees tonight and tomorrow so we decided to cut our hike short today and head to Dahlonega GA. We hiked 4.2 miles to Cooper Gap where we could get picked up by a guy who shuttles hikers to and from the trail. We spent a very cold 5 hours waiting get picked up. While we waited a US Forest Trail Technician named Jake stopped by and check the hikers there. He made sure we were all dry and warm and encouraged us to head to town until it warms up a bit. He was a really nice guy, the taxpayers are getting their money’s worth from him. We will take a zero day tomorrow. We got a hotel room and will resupply while we are in town. BTW a zero day is AT jargon for taking a day off from hiking for a day. It is recommended to take a zero day at least once a week, we just took ours on the third day thanks to Mother Nature.","Hawk Mouton Shelter

Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556655,"We got a ride to Cooper Gap trailhead and slacked packed to Woody Gap. We have been shuttled back and forth from the trail by a nice guy named Richard. He uses his private car to pick up hikers from the trail and takes them to town and then from town to the trail. Slack packing is when you only carry a small day pack with the things you need just for the time you are on the trail. At the end of the day Richard came and picked us up at Woody Gap, he will take us back there tomorrow to start our next leg of the hike. We spent three nights in the hotel due to the cold weather but tomorrow we will take off from Woody Gap and be out for the next five days. The day started cold and windy but once we got hiking and the sun came out a bit we warmed right up. The trail was pretty easy today, a couple of long ups, especially Justus Mountain but that was the first climb of the day and it was soon behind us. The trail early on was very easy walking, all the mud was frozen but as the day warmed up the mud became slippery and we had to watch our step. All in all today's hike was uneventful but full of some great views of the mountains once we got up on the mountain tops. The good views are mainly because the trees have not leafed out yet, those views will be gone in a month or so. Enjoy them while we can! We have met a lot of really cool people on the trail. We met a young man who was hiking the AT alone and will probably join the Army when he finishes. I've noticed a lot of people who have either just got out of the service or are planning to join soon. Lots of people are out just to find out what the next step in their lives might be. I guess that is one of the reasons why I'm hiking myself. After retiring last year I decided that a physical challenge like the AT will give me a lot of time to think and to decide on what to do with the rest of my life. I want to explain the ""Mr. Deeds"" that you might have seen on my page. A lot of people are given ""trail names"", often reflecting their personality or something they have done. Early in my blog I asked people to consider doing a good deed every day. This is something I have tried to do ever since I was in Scouts. When a woman named Jackie from Virginia suggested I call myself Mr. Deeds, several other people agreed so I decided that Mr. Deeds was my trail name. Time to sign off but remember, I will be out on the trial for the next five days so you won't hear from me for a while. Peace to you all.","Cooper Gap
",Woody Gap,"Mar 16, Thu",8.30
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557219,"This is a summary from Woody Gap (3/17) to Dick's Creek Gap (3/21). Today (3/22) is a zero day and I'm catching up on my journal at the Hiawassee, GA Public Library. 3/17: we hiked up over Blood Mountain, it was quite a hike made more challenging by the fact that the trail to the top was rocky, full of tree roots and covered by packed snow and ice. (see picture on my Photo page). At the top were some wonderful vistas which is your reward for the punishing up hill slog. We got into Bull Gap campsite around 5:30 set up camp, ate, hung our bear bags* and went to bed around 7 p.m. Pay attention to this routine because it is pretty much the same every night (so far) on the trail. The younger hikers usually make a fire and sit around talking and socializing but everyone is pretty much in their tents and quite by 9 p.m. 3/18: It rained last night and we woke up to some heavy fog, I went out to retrieve our bear bags and could not find my way back to camp. I knew I wasn't lost but had to call for my partner, Pat, to help me find my way back. He blew his emergency whistle which was music to my ears and I was back in camp in no time. We befriended a nice young couple from MI, Dustin and Veronica (Ronnie). Dustin just got out of the Marines and was hiking to restore his faith in mankind. The trail is a good place to do that. Ronnie just graduated with her Mechanical Engineering Degree from U of MI (the Blue One). They were a great couple who we met several times over the next few days. We had our first Trail Magic** today. Our trail magician was Bobby who served us home made chicken noodle soup, hot drinks and provided all the fresh water our water bottles would hold. The sense of community and support is unbelievable. It was great seeing some of the people we are establishing relationships with. There is a woman named Jane in her mid 50's hiking with a small three pound Chiwawa mix. It is bad enough that Jane starts out later from camp each day that we do and passes us every day but her little dog is trekking right along with her. Hiking the trail is a humbling experience.3/19: We finished the day at Rocky Mountain camp site, the picture above was taken in the morning when we started our hike for the day. Tonight we made dinner with Chelsea, Brooklyn, and a few others. Chelsea is hiking the AT with her dog which appears to be a terrier of some type, high energy and a little shy which sucks big time since I'm going through major dog withdrawal. I'm missing my dog, Cassie, big time and I would love to pet and hang out with a dog, but Chelsea's dog would not cooperate. We ran into trail magic again, this time hamburgers, hot dogs, brats, snacks and water. What a wonderful experience this all is.3/20: We hiked to Addis Gap camp ground and had a very solitary night, just the two of us camping on our own. We agree that having others around to talk to makes the trail more interesting. Setting up camp and breaking down camp becomes a routine and the more we do it the more efficient we become. Some people take 2 hours to break camp and get on the trail in the morning. Pat and I can do it in under an hour and that includes breaking down our tents. 3/21: We packed up camp in the dark this morning (a first) since we wanted to get started on the trail and make it to Dick's Creek Gap by 11 a.m. to catch a ride to Hiawassee. We made it by 10:30 with plenty of time to spare. The first 30 min of hiking today was in the dark and we used our head lamps. The trail was pretty good, not many rocks or roots so hiking in the dark wasn't bad. We had one big uphill slog today, Young Lick Knob, it was about 800 feet rise over about a mile. We were fresh and climbed it pretty fast. We were picked up the by the Hiawassee Budget Inn Shuttle with several hikers. Chelsea and Brooklyn and several others we had not met were on the shuttle. We ran into Dustin and Ronnie, our friends from Low Gap (3/18) it is always fun to see folks you know. I doubt we ever see them again since they hike much faster that we do. There were a cute couple and I will miss them. Well that is about all for now, we will hit the trail tomorrow (3/23) and hike another 4 days, we plan to be in Franklin, NC on 3/28. It will be great to be out of Georgia, not because we don't like the state but because it will feel like we have accomplished a milestone. A huge percent of thru hikers never make it out of Georgia, I don't want to be part of that cohort. So, until next time, happy trails to you!   Mr. Deeds    *you have to put your food, ""smellables"" such as chap stick, sun block, etc. in a bag and hang it in a tree so bears can't get into it. If you leave those items on the ground you will be very hungry since the mice and bears have no sense of private property and don't even think of bringing the bag into your tent, or at least make sure your life insurance is paid up.**people, usually people who have hiked the AT before go to places where the AT crosses a road and they set up tables and chairs and serve food and drinks to hikers. It is truly magic.","Woody Gap

Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557625,"We set out from Dick's Creek Gap around 9:30 a.m. after getting a shuttle ride from Hiawassee. The mountains are still a hard slug up and down, I can't wait to get my trail legs. We hiked to Bly Gap a total of nine miles by 3:00 p.m. which is good timing considering our late start.We crossed the GA-NC border today it feels like a big accomplishment.

I have a very fitful night, not much sleep. I took Tylenol which helped a little but we still had to hike out. I was in so much pain on the way down that I decided I needed my shoulder looked at. My hiking partner Pat did an excellent job finding someone to pick us up from Deep Gap high in the mountains. I am so appreciative of his help, he saved the day. I was very uncomfortable. Ms. Beverly came and picked us up she drove me to the Urgent Care Center and Pat to the hotel. She was the kindest person and you could tell she truly lived her values. She was also helping a very under prepared hiker who came off of the trail with us. He had no pack no sleeping bad, etc. She helped him find free geAR and even put him up at her house for a few days for free. The people down south have huge hearts you see it everywhere you go.

Interesting factoid, the actor who plays ""The Beast"" is the same person who played Mary's first husband in Downton Abby. Ms. Beverly has done a wonderful job driving us around while we are in town. When she is not available the she will find another shuttle driver for us. They don't like to take money, other than gas money, from us. These folks like helping people and it really shows.

Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558366,"Hi all, by now most of you know I injured my right shoulder in a falling accident and because of that I have decided to leave the trail, at least for this year. What follows is a timeline of the events leading to the injury and my subsequent decision to leave the trail.March 23rd: Pat and I had just hiked out of Georgia and were in the first camp site in North Carolina, Bly Gap. We set up camp and while finishing up with our dinner I fell backwards and jammed my elbow into the ground jarring my shoulder. At that time I did not know how bad it was but I did know it hurt like all get out. I spent a very fitful night trying to find a comfortable position with little success.March 24th: I woke up feeling better and was eager to get moving, Pat helped me on with my pack and off we went. We were not hiking very long before the pain in my shoulder got so bad that I knew I had to get off the trail and have it looked at by a doctor. We got to a place where the trail crosses the road and called for a shuttle ride. The very nice woman who came to pick us up, Beverly, took me to an Urgent Care center where I was examined and x-rayed. There were no broken bones and so I decided to rest my shoulder for a few days to see if I could get back on the trail.March 25th - 28th. I spent four very boring days in Franklin, NC mostly taking it easy and cruising the Internet on my cell phone. Pat did a couple of day hikes while I recovered. I would like to point out that the people of Franklin are all wonderful and were eager to help me out in any way. It was boring because I wanted to be on the trail with Pat not sitting in a hotel room flipping channels.March 29th: I felt better (not 100%) and decided to give hiking another go. we hiked 11 miles that day and by the end of the day I was feeling pretty good and very optimistic. Then came bed time. The nature of a rotator cuff injury is such that the pain is not too bad when you are in an upright position either sitting or standing, but the real pain hits when you lay down. And boy did the pain hit! I spent the night wishing I could crawl out of my skin. Somewhere around midnight I decided that I needed to have my shoulder looked at further and that my hike was over.March 30th: Pat and I hiked to another place where a road crossed the trail and we called Beverly (my own personal angel of mercy) to come and rescue me from the trail. Pat decided to continue hiking to the next shelter and we parted ways with a manly handshake and well wishes all around. Beverly took me back to Franklin and dropped me off at a car rental agency. I was able to rent a car and drove home that night. I arrived home around 2:30 in the morning and was greeted by a very happy dog and a very sleepy wife. (only one actually got up to say hi, you get to decide which one)March 31st: After a night sleeping in the recliner, I called my orthopedic surgeon (yes, when you get my age they assign you your own personal orthopedic surgeon, ""just in case"") anyway, he examined me and said that I had a rotator cuff tear or bruise and decided to treat me conservatively to see how I responded. He gave me some prednisone and exercises and told me to come back in 10 days. Which is where I am right now, taking prednisone, doing my exercises and hoping to avoid surgery.I would like to thank everyone who has been following my blog, providing encouragement and support along the way. This turn of events is obviously a bitter disappointment for me but like the saying goes, If you want to make God Laugh, make a plan. I am blessed in so many ways and this little hiccup just helped me realize how many loving, caring, and wonderful people I have in my life. I now look forward to spending some time trying to figure out my next steps, taking prednisone and doing some exercises. Take care and until we meet again, Happy Trails to You!

Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562079,"Hi all, Since my last entry I have had a MRI done on my right shoulder. They found two torn tendons in my rotator cuff that will possibly require surgical repair. I have surgery scheduled for June 26th to repair the tendons. The surgeon will see me a week prior to the surgery to see if I will need to have it done. He is currently hoping that my pain and strength will improve and we won't need to do surgery. I hope so too, recovering from rotator cuff repair doesn't look like a whole lot of fun. As of now, I still have significant pain and weakness so I'm hoping to improve over the next five or six weeks. I am still sleeping in a recliner since sleeping horizontally is impossible due to pain. Anyway, that is about all I have for now, thank you for your continued interest and I appreciate your ongoing concern and wishes of good luck. It looks like I will not be returning to the trail in 2017 at least. Take care and happy trails to you all. John",,View Entry,"Apr 27, Thu",0
Mr. Deeds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568499,"Hi all, I visited my surgeon today and, as expected, we decided to proceed with the surgery.  The laparoscopic procedure is scheduled for the morning of June 26th at St. Mary's Hospital here in St. Louis.  The surgery will be performed by Dr. Scott Zehneder who comes highly recommended even though he looks like (to my 66 year old eyes) to be just emerging from puberty.  I have complete confidence in him and have no concerns other than the normal ones; wrong site procedures, surgical site infections, complications from anesthesia, aliens exploding from my stomach, oh wait, the last one was from a movie I saw.  
I will start physical therapy about 2 weeks following surgery and will not be fully recovered (i.e., putting on my backpack and heading for the mountains) until next summer.  I'm not looking forward to the experience but since I haven't had a full night's sleep since March 23rd I'm more than ready to get the show on the road. 
I would like to thank everyone who has showed so much concern and support though out my 'ordeal' I know no one likes whiners and you have all been very kind in putting up with my complaints and showing your interest in my well being.  
It's kind of weird, when I started the Appalachian Trail last March, the last place I thought I would end up is in surgery, but the trail is never a straight one and it takes you to places you never counted on.  I'm blessed to have so many good friends to help me along this journey and feel like I have a high probability that this surgery will result in a complete fix.  I am now taking names for partners to do some backpacking with me next summer.  So until then, take care and thanks for the support.  John",,View Entry,"Jun 13, Tue",0
