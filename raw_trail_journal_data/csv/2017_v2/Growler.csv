Growler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517442,"The great outdoors has and always will be a part of my life.From the moment I was able to travel, my parents would take me to visit my Grandparents. Luckily, they lived in Colorado. My dad's parents lived in Denver, with views of Mt. Evans, the Flat Irons, and a good part of the Front Range. My mom's parents settled in Allenspark, a small mountain community just outside of Rocky Mountain National Park. Nearly every summer of my youth was spent exploring the forests, creeks, trails, and peaks of the Rockies.A good portion of my youth, as well as a number of my adult years, included being active in Scouting. Beyond the basic outdoor skills, my involvement exposed me to climbing/rappelling, ropes course management, team building, wilderness medicine, Leave No Trace, and backpacking. My participation included treks to the Rockies, Adirondacks, Big South Fork Recreation Area, barrier islands of South Carolina, the Florida Keys, and Alaska. The best part...being able to share these trips with my kids.So what about today? I'm an empty nester with gray hair, aging joints, corrective lens, and the occasional episode of brain fade. But a man with the drive, determination, and desire to get back into the great outdoors.But the AT?Larry",,View Entry,"Nov 01, Sun",0
Growler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517443,"My professional career ended in 1998, when I choose to become Mr. Mom. Everything from homework, cooking, cleaning, sewing, sporting events, choir...I don't regret that choice and would not trade that time with my children for the world!However, like all working folks, my wife dreams of retirement. She would often remark how cool it would be to hike the AT. I would think to myself...that's a good idea...for you. So one day a few months ago, I decided why not expose her to the joys of backpacking. Carrying everything you need on your back is something completely new for her. So I put together some gear, some food, a route plan, and we set out for a quick outing on the AT in western MA.It was hot, humid, steep, rocky, challenging, exhausting! A tough hike, with a nice dinner and great night for camping. The return to the car was uneventful. I'm very proud of my wife for her determination on that outing. She pushed through. The result of the trip was completely the opposite of its' intentions. I managed to extinguish her AT dream and ignite my own.Ever since that trip, the AT is calling me. My head is full of ultralight gear, planning, wishing, dreaming. The start date can't come soon enough! I just need to share my ideas with my love. Fingers crossed.Larry",,View Entry,"Nov 10, Tue",0
Growler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517453,"After countless hours of searching the Internet for journals/videos/gear, days of dreaming of the AT, and weeks of thinking I'm insane for believing...I finally brought the idea to my wife.She is always there for me, believes in me, and encourages me. But I was nervous! I don't know why. I knew she would be supportive, yet somewhat reserved. I knew she would believe I could make it, but worry about the unforeseen. I knew she would be on my side...forever and always. But I was still nervous.SHE SAID YES!!!!Undoubtedly there are many obstacles to still overcome. But none that can't be dealt with. As long as she is by my side, on my side, we will make it happen!Now onto the next biggest step...sharing the crazy idea with my children, family members, and friends. Most already know that I'm little off my rocker. But a Thru Hike? That will probably surprise them all.I will see most of them next week for the holiday. The dream will just get stronger!Larry",,View Entry,"Nov 14, Sat",0
Growler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517885,"The first holiday of the season has come and gone. We traveled from MA to OH to spend time with our family. Over lunch one day, I shared my dream with my kids and my mother. The news was met with stunned optimism. The usual questions arose...""Why?"", ""How far is it?"", ""Is it safe?"", ""How do we keep track of where you are?"", and many more. Strangely, after that afternoon, the questions stopped. I'm not sure, but they may be in shock.The Thanksgiving shopping frenzy gave me a chance to start on my gear procurement. I used the discounts to purchase my sleeping bag, pad, and two jackets. It's not much, but a start. The research and decision-making process continues on the remaining gear. Still struggling with the pack and tent selection. It's difficult to balance the light weight with the high cost. Other planning also continues. My AWOL guide arrived and I've begun studying the first few weeks of the route. My plan is to travel slowly and over shorter distances for the first several weeks. Regardless of how great I feel, I know my old bones will need time to acclimate. On the flip side of trip planning, I'm trying to identify the obstacles that will need to be addressed. Some are easy to overcome. Others more difficult.For now, I'll just keep researching, planning, reading, and walking. The dream lives on!Larry",,Happy Thanksgiving!,"Dec 01, Tue",0
Growler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520381,"The Holiday season is past, it's a new year, and I'm one day closer to the start of my adventure. My travels in the past few months have taken me through PA, MA, NH, and VT. In each state, I was within site of the AT, able to view the ridge lines that I so dream about. In PA, I was visited the trail, albeit for a very short time because it was frigid and windy. It was good for the soul and further reinforced my drive to complete my hike.The other exciting news...I have a trail name. One of my interests is craft beer. Everything from the brewing process, visiting breweries, and enjoying the friendships brought together by sharing a cold one. Besides sampling straight from the brewery, the next best method for enjoying fresh beer is to acquire the beer in a 64 ounce glass jug...known as a growler. I look forward to sharing stories and a few cold ones with new friends on the trail. So i think it's appropriate...call me ""Growler"".Gear, reading, and planning still consume many of my free hours. I've acquired some gear and narrowed the choices down for the rest. As I fret over a few ounces in my pack, my work continues to shed pounds off my frame. Winter in New England isn't the best time to be outside. So I've taken to ""urban adventure hiking""...mall walking. It's better than the stationary wheel of boredom. When the season changes, I hope to be out on a nearby trail testing gear and honing skills.Best wishes to the Class of 2016! I look forward to your stories from the trail.Growler",,"Read, Plan, Gear Up, Exercise","Jan 29, Fri",0
Growler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523477,"This winter in New England has been very mild...YES! In fact, so nice, that it was possible to get out on the trail last week. My four legged hiking buddy, Riley, and I out set out from Lee, MA and headed to the October Mountain Shelter. With the approach trail, it was just short of 15 miles round trip.We had a great time. The trail was everything from dry, to muddy, to icy...flat, steep...clear, downed lumber...but mostly covered in leaves. The plan was to stay in the shelter, but it has been damaged. Someone thought it would be a good idea to build a fire inside the shelter. There is a 6' hole burnt into the floor, right through the support beam and several joists. Thankfully, I brought a tent.Here are some random thoughts from the adventure:1. I walked over 300 miles in January and February. Most of it indoors and on relatively flat surfaces. The mileage adequately prepared me for the uphill sections. However, it did nothing to condition my legs for the downhill sections. Work needs done to strengthen my quads. Plus I need more overall flexibility.2. We covered the 7.5 miles in six hours. With the varying trail conditions, I was happy with the pace. Because of all the leaves on the trail and other slippery forces, I'm not sure it was safe to push any faster. Everyone talks of their ""trail legs""...I hope that with the ""trail legs"" comes ""trail footing"". 3. Besides being too heavy...my old one person backpacking tent is too small. The cramped confines are fine for a few days, but I can't see myself living in that space for months. I must be able to sit up in my thru hike tent and have some room to store stuff.4. I will need to figure out my routine. It seems that it should be simple, but it will take some time to get it right. Everything from when, where, and how much to eat & drink, hiking plans, personal hygiene, camp chores, rest...they all take time and consideration. Plus the motivation to get them done.5. I will need to work on my food planning. Especially early on in my hike, I will need to ensure that I don't over pack my food. So...what do I do from here? The new gym I joined several months ago is scheduled to open soon. Strength training and yoga are in my near future. But nothing prepares you for the trail like being out on the trail. So with the improving weather, I'll be outside hiking instead of indoor urban hiking. Plus, my goal is to take an overnight hike at least once a month, for the next six months.Good luck to all the 2016 hikers!For all us 2017 hikers...get outside and test your gear, your body, and your mind!Growler",,Overnight AT Hike,"Mar 14, Mon",0
Growler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536026,"Greetings everyone! Hope your training, planning, and gear selections are keeping you engaged.The planning process for me won't begin for some time. I'm not one to get in too deep, too early when it comes to the details of the daily grind. For now, there is comfort in knowing the rough schedule and knowing my time is approaching.My gear selections are nearly complete, but not necessarily purchased or finalized. Mostly the clothing remains on the ""buy"" list. Like others on this site, I'm hoping that my size will be slightly smaller later this year. Several pieces of gear have been tested and put aside after finding they don't suit my needs or don't feel right. Even if you think your choices are solid, I recommend you get out there and test every piece in real life. Experience is the true judge.My training is going great. There is a State Forest near my home and I'm out at least four times a week hiking. At this point, for my training hikes, I'm carrying about twenty pounds. My hikes are typically no less than seven miles and have gone as far as eighteen miles. But there is no training like the real deal...so last week it was off to western MA for an AT shakedown.It was a challenging and successful hike. I met a number of this years hikers. Most had started in the first few weeks of February. It was interesting to observe their gear, trail demeanor, camp chores, and food selections. It seemed many of them were adding supplements to their food. With the dietary demands of hiking, guess I need to research this a bit more. My big takeaways from this hike:a) Base weight is important - try to shave a pound from my packb) When it's hot, humid, and hilly, don't underestimate your water sources...HYDRATEc) If you see gnawing or chewing marks on the shelter, beware of the porcupined) Be prepared with the knowledge and supplies to repair your geare) Bugs suck! Be mentally and physically prepared to deal with the insectsTo keep my family engaged and to give them some insight into hiking, I started taking videos while on the trail. It is a way to show them what I see and feel. Initially, I posted the videos to my Facebook page. Recently, I decided to make a YouTube channel so the videos could all be stored in one place.
