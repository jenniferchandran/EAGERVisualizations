Flash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554564,"February 6-8 Torreya State Park to prepare for Appalachian Trail. 
The park has many high bluffs overlooking the Apalachicola River and makes Torreya State Park one of Florida’s most scenic places. The park has steep bluffs rising more than 150 feet above the river, making this topography very unique for Florida. In the 1800s the Apalachicola River was an important interstate highway, when General Andrew Jackson crossed this river with his army. More than 200 steamboats traveled the Apalachicola River. After Florida became a U.S. territory, the first government road, constructed in 1828 across north Florida, met the river here in the park.
My daughter and I spent three days traversing this unique terrain as we tried out some new gear and tried to prepare our bodies physical. Not only does the park offer challenging inclines and descents normally seen in the mountain but offers, swamp, steep head ravine and high pineland forests. The three days was definitely a challenge. 
The first day we hiked to the Torreya Challenge Primitive Campsite. There are two hiking loops in the park that are connected in the middle by a connector trail. We hiked half of each of these circles before ending at our campsite accomplishing just over 8 miles since we did not get started till 1130. We arrived at camp 30 minutes before sundown. My daughter and I were in a race to get the tents put up and dinner cooked before the sunset before all light left us. Everything got accomplished and we sat and ate our staple meal of Ramen noodles with dehydrated vegetables and meat added. My noodles had quinoa added as well. Both meals were delicious to top it off I shared my Oreo cookie pudding. By 730pm we were both in our tents ready for a good night’s sleep. I slept under my cuben fiber tarp and with the rising moon could see quite well with the bright moon illuminating our High pineland forests. My daughter used her new single person tent from Light Heart Gear. She had no problem assembling it and she is well pleased with this piece of gear.
The second day we back tracked our route to put in just over 11 miles to camp at Rock Creek Primitive Campsite. The walk would take us through all the terrain Torreya offers. The climb up and down the high steep bluffs of the Apalachicola River would provide a challenge and sore calf muscles. I would climb the bluff one last time before our camp site to tour the Gregory House and top off our water supply for the night’s meal. The Gregory House originally sat across the river at Ocheesee Landing, was built around 1849 by planter Jason Gregory. After the Civil War and slavery was abolished the plantation declined. The Gregory House was abandoned in 1935 and donated to the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It was then dismantled, moved across the river and re-constructed in its current location. It a a beautifully white washed 2 store home with the trading porch wrapping around the entire house and the kitchen separated from the main house by a breeze way. My daughter and I had set a fast pace all day as sever thunderstorms were in the forecast to arrive around 5pm. The forecast called for gust up to 70mph. Katie and I hiked separately all afternoon. We meet for lunch then I left early. Some how she got turned around when she decided to take a short cut. See realized her error when she arrived back at our lunch location one hour later. To make matters worst her frustration lead to another error. She walked right out the front gate past the US flag, Florida flag and POW flag. She did not realize here error till she pasted a mail box and house one half mile latter. So she did a about face and waked back into the park down the main road ad a connector trail to our camp site.
We both were successful in setting up camp and cooking dinner before the storm hit. I was slower assembling my tarp into a hexagonal shelter for the first time and had to eat my dinner alone inside my shelter. We experienced very high winds and lot of rain till midnight. The blowing rain caused everything in the tents to be damp or wet. I had several seams that leaked and dripped water all night. I had sewn attachment point and forgot to seam seal them! The next day as we were breaking camp Kevin the park Rangers called to check on us. He said they were concerned with all the trees that blown over and they believed a tornado may have swept thought the park. 
The last day we were going to walk till noon but Katie had a few blisters and decided on just one and half miles. I stretched my legs and walked a little over 4 miles. As I hike I saw the damage of the high winds, causing lot of blow downs throughout the park. The park had to call in additional help to cleanup from the prison camp located a few miles away. The inmates ran chain saws all morning cutting up the fallen trees.
We both had a great time and learned a few more things that need to be fixed before starting the Appalachian Train in three weeks.",, Torreya State Park,"Feb 06, Mon",0

Pulse I have experienced the demise of my cellphone, three days into our trip. My daughter and I practiced and tried to prepare but we lack hills and mountains in Florida. Our first day we got a late start but wererewarded with a great breakfast at Amicalola Falls State Park and Lodge. I also had to sew up a rip in my pants before we left. My wife and son walked with us to the top of Springer Mountain were we took some kick off pictures. It was difficult to say our goodbyes knowing the time we would be apart. My daughter and I made it seven miles to HAWK MTN shelter before night fall and slept in the loft of the shelter. When we arrived a young man would not stop talking to us and just kept asking questions. I finally ignored him and he started bothering a couple from Korea. The next morning I asked my daughter what was his problem and was informed he was smoking marijuana and was high. Guess I have lived a shelter life! Everyone in the shelter left together the next morning, our dope smoker lead the way and hit the whacky weed again andupset everyone with his demeanor. He took of and left us all with a burst of energy. Lady bug and I meet our new friend ""Up In Smoke"" walking towards us. He asked if we had seen a glass vase on the trail; it had fallen out of his bag and he wanted to know if we had seen it laying on the trail. I told him we had not seen anything like that on the trail. Our new friend then had a mental break down stomping around and yelling. I thought wow that vase must be important. Ladybug was quick to point out; maybe he lost his bong. We left him beside the trail to deal with it on his own as he stomped and threw things around. When we told our fellow hikers what happened, they all cheered. Today our goal was to reach Woody Gap and sleep in our tent. The day was difficult due to the cold and windy conditions. Ladybug and I walked up on our shelter mate and fellow hiker J.W. around 1500hrs and he was drinking a tall boybeer and talking to a new hiker. J.W. was quick to introduce us and said he had told this trail angle all about us and we deserved a beer as well. The trail angle stated he had tried to give the beer to others but J.W. told him he had to wait till Flash and Ladybug arrived. That was the best hot beer in the world. We finally arrived at Woody Gap as the temperature dropped and the wind howled. We had hidden our food and water cache there. The preposition food was a welcome site as we were out of water and hungry. Ladybug and I dinned on MREs and camped with Raven, Mac and J.W. On Saturday 4 March I cooked Spam for breakfast and served it on tortillas. With a great breakfast we headed off to climb Blood Mtn. the highest mountain in Georgia with a elevation of 4,458 feet. The temperature rose making it the warmest day so far and a pleasant hike. Today we ended our day at Hostel Mtn Crossing for $18.00 we got a bunk and shower. We stayed with the following thru hikers we meet Mac, Floater, Onion and Goat.     Our goal for 5 March was to make Low Gap shelter. This would be a hard march due to the cold weather and high winds. Ladybug and I would be rewarded with Trail Magic as a trail angle was cooking hamburgers for all the thur hikers. We feasted on a burger, chips, chocolate chip cookies and a soda. Due to our late start we had a late arrival at the shelter forcing us to sleep in the tent. Ladybug and I both ate dinner and went to sleep by 1900hrs. The forecast on 7th was for rain so we decided to make it over Tray Mtn before the storm hit the following day. Tray Mtn is 4,400 feet with a steep ascent plus we had to cover 16 miles. This was our highest miles covered in one day and it was hard on both of us. Ladybug and I reached the Tray Mtn shelter at 1700hrs with our feet and legs worn out. The shelter would be packed with eight people sleeping side by side and no room to spare. There was a couple from Sweden, a man from Scotland pulse Onion, Floater and Good Life in the shelter with us. Everyone was tucked into their sleeping bag by 1900hs. I woke up at 2100 hrs as our storm rolled in the wind, rain and fog soaked everything in the shelter. The fog was so thick I was concerned I might not find the privy or not be able to find the shelter when I returned. The visibility was only a few feet due to the thick fog and rain. Everyone rose at 0530 on 7 March and started packing up there backpack in anticipation of the coming sun rise. It was so foggy at sunrise, Onion made the comment “I don't think the sun is coming out today"", which everyone thought was hilarious but looked to be true. We waited till there was enough light to safely walk heading down Tray Mtn. to Dicks Creek Gap. This would mark a mile stone on our AT adventure as we now have walked 70 miles. To reward our efforts we decided to stay at the Top of the Georgia hostel and take a Zero day to give our bodies a rest. We were informed that 20% of thru hikers have quite before reaching Dicks Creek Gap. Tonight we will take a shuttle into Hiwassee, Ga to have our first real meal in five days.     Tomorrow we will leave here and march towards the Ga - NC border. This will be another milestone leaving one state and going to another and will put us at traveling 78 miles. Our goal is to reach Franklyn, NC in four days to resupply. I hope here to also find a replacement phone to better share out adventure.","

Flash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556389,"    The last time I checked in we were at Mile 70 and I was without a phone. I felt extremely guilty since I didn't share with you the truth about what happened to Up In Smoke. Ladybug and I stumbled upon a vase in the middle of the trail that looked a lot like a bong. I started to pick it up but ladybug told me that I shouldn't touch it. I should just leave it where it was. I thought what if this belongs to Up In Smoke, I could solve everyone's problem by just throwing this off the side of the mountain. So after much contemplation I picked up the VASE and threw it over the edge of the mountain. I didn't feel too bad when Up In Smoke asked me if I'd seen a vase because technically I didn't lie to him when I said no I haven't seen a vase. Okay now I feel much better I told you to.          On 9 March Ladybug and I came to Mooney Gap a road crossing with trail magic. There was a couple in their late sixties that in the back of their truck they had set up free food. There was also five chairs formed in a circle for everyone to sit and talk. The couple had hot soup, hot tea, coffee, sandwiches and fresh fruit. I elected elected to have milk cookies and a banana. When I arrived there was no one else there so I set down and talk to them. I quickly found out that they had gone on a mission trip to South America. I shared with them the similarities of their mission trip to the Department of Defense trying to rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq through projects such as agriculture assistance and several other examples of humanitarian assistance. It was the first they had heard of such projects and were quite enthralled to hear my stories of events I had been involved with. I shared with them why I was hiking the Appalachian Trail and that my daughter was with me. They thanked me very much for the conversation and I went on my way after thanking them for the Trail Magic. A few miles later it was great to reach a mile stone at mile 78. We left the state of Georgia and entering the state of North Carolina. It was really such a great feeling to be able to say; you have walked from one state to another I can't imagine what it will be like as we walk through three, four or five states. Our sense of accomplishment will be so high. The evening of 9 March we elected to stay in Muscat Creek shelter at a elevation of 4560 feet. Ladybug and I knew that there would be a fierce storm coming through late in the evening and did not wish to be in the tent. The storm came in around 2 o'clock AM, as I was awoken by the thunder and lightning as the storm approached. The Leading Edge of a cold front raced up the mountain creating a fierce gust of wind up to 30 to 35 miles per hour and dropping about 3 to 5 inches of rain. Some of the unlucky souls that camped around our shelter in their tent had not properly secured there rain flies. There were three individuals that lost the rain fly during the gust of winds dumping water on their sleeping bags and gear. One of the young ladies named Winter walked into the shelter and sat down at the picnic table. I asked her if she was okay and warm enough and she responded ""Yes, but everything I have is soaking wet. I'll wait till sun up to see what I can do."" The temperature that night was down in the thirties so we were concerned about everyone who had wet gear.     The forecast for 10 March was high winds and temperatures in the upper 30s throughout the day with scattered snow showers. Luckily for the people with wet gear there wasn't much snow and it turn to drizzle early and then the sun came out but the wind was deadly cold throughout the day as the temperatures hovered around 37 to 35. The combination of sunshine and wind helped their gear dry after hanging it up in a meadow. Ladybug and I were both concerned about bad weather again due to the forecast so we elected to try to get inside the next shelter, Carter Gap shelter. We both arrived early and by 2 o'clock we had cooked our dinner and we were laying in the sun with five other hikers like turtles basking on a log. The inside of the shelter was in the shade of the trees and was more than 10 degrees difference between being out in the sunshine and in a cave of a shelter. We both laid around all afternoon enjoying the sunshine and speaking to some of the fellow hikers that we met like Gimli, Papa Smurf, Sherpa, Truck, Engizer and her sister Pig Pen. Energizer and Pig Pen are sisters who are both in there 60s. They are hiking the Appalachian Trail together and they are pretty much opposite of each other. Energizer is fast organize and always leads the way. Pig Pen requires guidance and is always dragging into camp late. Pig Pen told us she counts every step she makes during the day and gets more depressed as the count goes higher. She said every time she catches up to her sister during the day on the trail she tries to look pitiful and tired and hopes that she'll stop early for camp.     Around 5:30 that afternoon Ladybug, Pig Pen, Energizer and I start to prepare to bed down. When Sherpa pulls out a set of speakers that looks like a Boombox from the 1980s. Now I know why he has the name Sherpa, because he carries all kinds of stuff that's not require. Papa Smurf starts playing eighties and nineties music as loud as the little box will play plus there's at least 10 people cooking meals inside the small shelter overhang. I continue to bed down put my ear plugs in as deep as they will go and somehow miraculously doze off to sleep.    Sleeping in a Adirondack shelter on the Appalachian Trail makes departing much easier in the morning because there's no tent to breakdown but the Adirondack shelter is small to begin with. The shelter seems to collect everyone to socialize until around 7 or 8 o'clock when suddenly everyone disappears and lays down and goes to sleep. Occasionally some energetic young male are several males with scurried through the woods and bring firewood to the shelter firepit and this will cause people to stay up until 9 o'clock but at 9:01 magically everyone is in their sleeping bags asleep. I on the other hand prefer to be tucked in by 6:30 and asleep by 7pm. We rise 30 minutes before sunset and pack up so we can be walking get at first light.    On 11 March we woke up early and begin our march to Rock Gap shelter. The highlight of our day was to scale Albert Mountain and climb the fire tower. I do mean scale because you had to use your hands and arms to pull yourself up from one rock face to another. Albert Mountain is quite tall and reaches 5,213 feet. The view at the top of Albert Mountain has been one of the best so far as you can see the many mountain ranges that lay ahead of us. The view did not last long as I watched dark clouds roll in that reduced visibility to less than a thousand feet. The temperature quickly plummeted requiring everyone to put on extra layers and continue to walk North to stay warm. When ladybug and I reached Rock Gap the shelter was full and one piece of ground next to the shelter was flat enough for a tent. We checked the forecast and it said four to six inches of snow. I voted to put the tent up and enjoy the snow. Ladybug demanded we depart at the next road crossing and find a room. To say the least she won when she called and made reservations and said she had paid for my room and I was going with her.    Now we are at Mile 106 and have gone into the town of Franklin North Carolina. We departed the trail on 11 March to avoid the four to six inches of snow that dropped in the mountains. We spent Monday the 13th running errands as we had to get a power of attorney for Ladybug and go to an Outfitter to get her some wool long johns.     So that places us in Franklin, North Carolina as more snow falls each day in the mountains around us.","Mile 60

Flash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556536,"With the winter storm taking Ladybug and I off the trail for a few days we looked at the next 40 miles of trail and decided it would be better to try and knock out a few miles with a day hike. The next 25 miles had some step climbs and with all the snowed and ice we felt it would be better to slack pack ie: a day's worth of thru-hiking unencumbered by a full pack. Plus the night time low temperatures for the trail here have been between 17-10 degrees.    We started our day off at 7AM riding the free shuttle to the First Baptist Church of Franklin, NC. They offer a free pancake and bacon breakfast to all the back packers in town. We were given a warm welcome by the preacher and shown these huge poster for each year of thru hikers since 2008. Each hiker is asked to sign the poster with there trail name. He explains there out reach mission during the month of March to all hikers. Everyone was very cordial, I sat next to the preacher and we talked for a long time. Everyone had there picture taken so the hikers could write a short letter and have it mailed to a loved one for free. Overall it was such a warm welcome that Ladybug and I will be going back every day for free pancakes and bacon.      We had decided to slack pack a section of trail between Rock Gap and Wayah Gap (meaning bear in Cherokee). It was a distance of nine miles. The weather in Franklin was sunny but we could see the mountain peaks were under thick cloud cover from the hotel. We road the daily shuttle to start our hike and was accompanied by a fellow hiker named Cap. When we arrived at Rock Gap the ground had around 3 inches of snow. The trail was either really muddy or the snow packed down from all the foot traffic. Thought out the days hike the temperature would drop to the low 30s with a average wind of 15 mph. Our first climb was up and over Wallace Mtn. Within 20 minutes everyone was sweating and shedding layers of clothing. The morning hike was not too bad with the snow falling but as we grew close to the end at Siler Mtn the weather grew worse with a steady wind and snow flurries forced us to out on extra layers. The snow had formed drifts on the west side of Wayah Gap making it difficult at times to follow the trail. I sent a text to our pick up driver one hour prior to arrival at Wayah Gap so when we arrived he was waiting. It was a great feeling to step inside the heated van and out of the cold. When we arrived back at the hotel Ladybug took a nap and we ate leftovers before preparing for the next days slack pack.Link to related pictures. https://goo.gl/photos/zXSM29BiNgxfz6gE6","Franklin, NC

Flash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556605,"    Today was our second day of slack packing we started back at Wayah Gap mile number 115 and set our sights on Tellico Gap miles number 130 a distance of 15 miles. The night prior it had snowed 3 inches so right away we were going slow. There were times as we climbed to Wayah Bald the snow drifts were 3 to 4 feet deep. Lady bug and I were the first to walk this section of trail after the snow and were forced to pack down the snow with each step. We slugged forward for about 3 hours until late we came to the First shelter. Everyone had left and thankfully packed the snow for us. We finally reached the top of Wayah Bald at 5,335 feet and the view was breathtaking. All the cloud cover had dissipated. and the sun was shining bright. Ladybug and I descended down the mountain into Licklog Gap heading directly into the wind. We faced a short climb back up then had a 2,000 foot decent into Wallace Gap followed by a climb back up 2300 feet all in deep slippery snow. There were times when walking uphill it felt like walking up a sand dune, with each fit placement you slide back a few inches. Hands down today's hike was the hardest and most taxing workout we have had to date.
  When Ladybug and I climbed Copper Ridge we meet a hiker named Pop Pop. She was alone at the shelter. Ladybug told her it was suppose to be below 7 degrees tonight she elected to use our ride to town and get out of the weather. We reached Tellico Gap and piled into the van with Pop Pop for a warm ride back to town. Pop Pop could not find any vacancies so we invited her to stay with us since we have a bedroom and kitchen that is separated with a door. She slept on the floor of the living room area and the hotel charged her only five dollars.    That put Ladybug and I at mile 130 and the temperatures will start to warm up tomorrow into the 40s.

We sent 3 days here and avoided sleeping in the 7 to 17 degree temperatures we had in the mountains. Some of our trail mates pressed on and sent pictures of them digging there tents out of fresh snow each morning. My daughter was strongly opposed to this option and had no problem expressing it. We walked 8.2 miles today to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. This was a steep down hill descent with the trail covered in ice and snow. When we got to 3350 foot of elevation the snow had mostly melted leaving lovely slippery mud. The views were tremendous as we walked down to the valley on a narrow Ridge line.

Then the packed down snow on the trail turned to slick ice. There were times it was really dangerous with a straight fall off beside the narrow frozen trail. There were spots that I stuck my hiking stick into the ice and rested my toes on the pole so I would not slide. It was just impossible to get traction. Ladybug and I finally made it to the shelter and claimed a spot for the night. Rain was predicted for 9pm till 7am and we did not want to take down the tent in the rain. We arrived around 2:30 and by 3pm we had eaten our dinner and sat by the fire trying to dry our damp socks. The shelter was full that night with 15 people. Ladybug and I laid our heads down at 5:45pm and both of us were asleep by 6pm. It was lots of noise from the new crow of people who stayed up late talking and laughing. I thought Ladybug might strangle her sleep mate next to her. The lady was a loud talker who seem to need attention. Her pillow would go flat during the night many times and wake up cussing loudly then huff and puff only to repeat 2hours later. When she was not huffing, puffing or cursing throughout the night she was snoring. I estimated she sawed down 60 acres of prime timber. Wow was the gal loud.    The next morning Ladybug and I talked to several of the hikers we had been traveling with. Hercules, Toro, Hawkeye (which is from Switzerland) and Blu-ray they all agreed they didn't sleep well and would walk exit milage to not deal with a repeat night.https://goo.gl/photos/YiyUDqLTZ22MKd848

Ladybug and I were glad we slept in the shelter plus all the tent spots were coveted in snow and frozen hard. The abundance of rain was a blessing as it melted away most of the ice and snow.    We had 20 miles left to reach Fontana Dam and decided to set our sights on Cody Gap because it had a spring for water. Half way through our day we climbed Jacob's Ladder a strenuous climb that ascends almost 800 feet and is almost vertical. That was a real work out for us flatlanders. We made it to Cody Gap by 4:30pm and split our task. Ladybug hiked down the gap to gap water and I put up our tent and hung the bear line for our food bags. The wind was relentless so we boiled out water using a small hollowed out tree for a wind screen. We then both climbed in the tent to eat seeking refuge from the cold. The night time low temperature hit 22 degrees making us both sputtering on a extra layer during the night.https://goo.gl/photos/YiyUDqLTZ22MKd848

Both Ladybug and I were tired from the days climb of Jacob's Ladder a near vertical climb up a 1000 feet. We both slept in not leaving Cody Gap till 9AM. The overnight night low was down in the 20s making for a cold night. Both of us had to put on extra layers to stay warm during the night. Today's destination is the Fontana Dam we will be staying in the Fontana Inn and taking a zero day before we venture into the Great Smoky Mountains. Today hike was mainly down hill with a few ups. The weather warmed up nicely from the 20s to the 50s and we had a moderate wind on the west side of the mountain faces. Ladybug and I were shocked to find hamburgers and hotdogs trail magic when we crossed the road at Stecoach Gap. A young man with the trail name Teeki had set up several chairs with a fire pit in the middle. He was grilling plus offered us chips and a beer. Boy that hot food and beer make my day so much brighter. Ladybug and I ordered a burger and I had a beer while we sat be the fire and talked to Teeki. Many of our fellow hikers came down the hill to the parking lot to include Grumpy, Nuc, Smiley, Sprinkles and Sunshine. We all lounged around for 45 minutes before everyone was anxious to get back on the trail. Ladybug and I arrived in Fontana at the same time as a young lady named Bubbles. We agreed to split the cost of a room. Since the Fontana Village is $77 per night. The ladies stayed in the room to shower and I took all the dirty laundry to the laundry mate. There was a line waiting on the 3 machines. Our friend Sardinia was emptied a washer and a was able to slide my clothes into a washer. We plan on eating at the resorts restaurant once the clothes are clean. Once we have eaten I can't wait to lay down in a real bed in a heated room.

She had a space beside me but 4 people showed up with reservation and I volunteered to moved out and set up the tent so Ladybug would not be alone in the tent..

We arrived in the parking lot around 730AM we had to walk the 1.4 miles to the shelter called the Fontana Hilton due to it's size and the fact it has showers. I made a grave error and left my toilet bag in the vehicle. My 5 dollars for the ride was inside it and when I paid the driver I landed the bag down and forgot the zip lock with my toilet paper, hand sanitizer and trail guide. On a positive note it's less weight. We are carried. 6 days worth of food making our packs the heaviest so far. Between the Shelter and the Dam I was able to get a cell signal and call my wife as soon as I stepped onto the Dam I lost my signal. Today our only option was to hike into the Great Smoky Mountains to the First shelter a distance of 13.1 miles. The first shelter is called Molies Ridge Shelter will sleep 12 people and has a fire place. There was a tarp up when Scarecrow, Hercules, Bubbles and I arrived. In the Smokes the first four AT hikers get a place to sleep if a day hiking group has reservation for the rest of the shelter. We took down the tarp since it was a warm day. The hike up to 4583 foot elevation took me 7 hours and encompassed 13.1 miles. The hike was really hard as there were several steep climbs as we climbed from the valley floor. The weather forecast call for rain around 6pm till 8am tomorrow. I am not sure if I will wait out the rain tomorrow or start walking. 13.1","Day 31

Ladybug and I had a slow start as we did all our morning chores tucked into the sleeping bags. Once every other items was packed up then we crawled out of the bag to start our day. The more we went up in elevation the more accumulation. Eventually we were facing snow up to my knees in the drifts and winds of 20 mph. This made for a long day and whipped both of us out. We decided to go down in elevation before quiting for the day but first we had to get water at the last spring. We stopped at Hogan Back Ridge Shelter and talked to Maple and Rocketer while we filtered our water. The walk down the mountain was a muddy mess. The snow had all melted and turned the trail into a flowing mud pit. It reminded me of walking in a pig pen. There was no avoiding the intrusion of cold ice water mixed with mudd into each shoe. Upon reaching Spivy Gap there was no flat spot found to pitch a tent. On the way down I meet some slack packers, I knew and asked them what was ahead of me. One person had sad there was a cemetery, but no one else went to check it out do they were not sure what it looked like. My first thought was; a cemetery probably has flat ground. My next thought was; there is no way Ladybug is going to want to stay there. Once I found the small family cemetery I was rewarded with a beautiful grassy knoll with the tumbs inside a wire fence and a flat parking area right outside the gate. In order to circumvent my second through from preventing me from using the only flat ground within 30 miles I quickly put the tent up. Of course when Ladybug bug arrived she protested and promised to tell her mom that I made here sleep in a cemetery. In the end we feel asleep by 730 under a full moon by the deceased people.","Day 38

We examined her achille tendon and it was swollen pretty bad and was painfully to be touched. The decision was made for her to take two days off while I kept walking. The shuttle driver arrived within 25 minutes and took her away. On the road to the cemetery was a great surprise of trail magic. A man named Paul was cooking eggs and potoes. I was the first to arrive and he was not completely setup. I put out all the chairs and ice chest with drinks while he cooked me breakfast. To my surprise it was 6 eggs and a huge plate of potatoes. With my new growing appetite I ate it all very quickly. I hurried off as my feet were quite cold in the shoes that had frozen overnight and wet socks. I made it to the top of Big Bald by 1 O'clock the entire morning was either slipping and sliding over ice or dealing with deep snow. Once I was over Big Bald I made much better time with about 3 miles being melt water and mud. Once I crossed Spivey Gap the walking was easier. I enter a long and narrow valley for 6 miles. Today was the longest so far. I walked 10 hrs but was able to cover 18 miles when I arrived at the shelter around 7pm. It was one of the longest since starting the AT.

Flat Foot
Ladybug amd I were on the phone first thing this morning trying to get our healthcare insurance to authorize a urgent care for her swollen achilles tendon. It took three hours on the phone before we had approval. The hostel gave us a free ride to the clinic. There was a couple from the area and because we both had on shorts and short sleeves with trail runners on our feet he ask with a strong southern draw "" did y'all jog here."" I said ""we did not jog here but we did walk here all the way from Georgia."" He proceeded to look at me like I was crazy. He responded ""you mean you walked all the way here to be treated at our clinic."" I said ""well yes it is one of the best but we walked on the trail at the edge of town and aim to walk all the way to the state of Maine."" His response was ""I knew there was a trail but had no idea it went to Maine, and are you really going to walk there. I think Maine is a long distance that might take awhile."" I responded my daughter and I will get there in 5 months.""
Next my new friend asked ""have you ever heard any strange noises when in the woods."" I said ""friend what do you mean by strange, like people noises or mechanical noises."" My friend said ""I don't talk about this to just any one and hardly ever speak of it, but I belive there is a Bigfoot that lives in the hallow."" I decide to use my ability as a great conversation instigator and
expand this conversation. I agree with my new friend that I believe there is something out there and he not crazy at all.
So he commits to tell me an in depth store about his encounter with Bigfoot. By now my daughter is so embarrassed and turning red. I tell my friend that I have heard other people tell me that they have heard these creatures beat their chest like a gorilla and I belive it is a warming or a way to communicate with each other. This sends him off the deep end as he expounds ""your exactly right that is what I have heard. No one has ever been more exact explaining what I heard."" 
My new friend's wife is called back to see the doctor and I try to end the conversation. I say ""it was a pleasure talking to you."" He tells his wife ""I am going to stay here and talk, you go on back."" She got upset and said ""you know I need your help now come on with me."" He did not go with her and they get into a augment but he stays to confine in me more secrets. My dear friend starts into another encounter story. It begins with ""I have never told a sole about this cause I also use this area to hide from the Law. He tells me how he was wanted by the sheriff and he built a hideout site in the woods by cutting up a water bed mattress and making it into a tent that he camouflaged and lived in for a few months and the law never found him. It was at his hide site that Bigfoot found him and scared him so bad he came down out of the mountains to face the law.
My encounter with my Bigfoot loving friend ends when his disgruntled wife came out and yanks him out of the chair and said ""you and I are leaving"" and she gave me a dirty look.
Ladybug was seen by the doctor and her diagnosis was positive. Her achille tendon was inflamed due to the deep snow stressing it and inproper insoles. She was referred to a Orthopedic specialist in the next town of Johnston City.
Now we will wait for our insurance to authorize a visit. I will continue to look for Bigfoot on the trail.","Day 39

Ladybug really enjoyed their attention as each pony tried to like her as the like the salty  hikers. We moved on to Old Orchard Shelter for the night.","

This shelter is super nice. It has a restroom  and shower plus you can have pizza delivered. I got up early and left Ladybug in the tent. It was a super hot day but a hour after I arrived at the Relax Inn it started to hail then turned to rain. Poor Laybug got caught in the rain and hail. The Relax Inn was a true roach motel. The shower was very nasty and had black mold growning everywhere. It provided a hot shower and a bed which is all I wanted.","

Flash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562864,Left the Relax Inn in Atkins after a good night sleep in the nasty hotel. We walked down the road to the Barn restaurant for breakfast. On my way I meet Popsicle who was hiking south bound and ask her if she wanted to join me. We shared what to expect on the trail since we are going opposite directions. We all had a great breakfast together then headed out. Today's was a hot day as we walked 14 miles to Knot Maul Branch Shelter. I ate at 6pm and was in the sleeping bag by 7pm.,"

Flash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562866,Turtle came into the Knot Maul Branch Shelter as I dozed off and at 530 am his alarm went off. I was not going to get up till 6am since we are walking 20 miles to Jenkins shelter. It rained all day and the wind gusts from 15 to 20 as I crossed the ridge lines. My feet and ankles hurt so bad. Going down hill was the worst as every steep as weight is applied it was painful. I was 2 miles away from the shelter and the sun came out so I took off my rain gear and turned it inside out for the sweat to dry. Less than 30 minutes later it was a downpour again. By the time I got my rain gear on I was soaked  from head to toe. The rain quite 5 minutes  later but I let the rain gear on until the sun came out again and it cleared up. When I got to the shelter Turtle was there cooking and a guy from Spain who spoke no English. I laid on my mate and elevated my feet. For one hour and the ate dinner just after 6. Not long after eating I was out for the night my feet needing to recover.,"

Flash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562867,"Today we walked 12 miles to  mile 590.1 on the AT at US 52. I had arranged for Bubba to pick us up and take us to the Greyhound bus stop in Wyrtheville, VA. The walk was fairly easy and mostly down hill. Many of the hikers we were with had to go into Bland, VA to resupply. Ladybug and I found a Motel 8 near the buss terminal and checked in. We were both pretty dirty with mud dried on our legs. The shower allowed us to clean up for our trip to Washington D.C. We are getting off the trail to ride on a Grayhound bus from 12am to 11am. We are going to surprise Jeniffer and spend time with her each night during her business trip to D.C. The bus ride should be fairly painful and we have a 2 hour layover in Richmond, VA. Those bus rides are never fun. ","

Flash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562871,Ladybug and I left the Motel 8 after a hot shower and washing clothes in the tub around 1040p.m. and walked over the interstate to the Greyhound terminal. The exit ramp here on the interstate has no side walks. So when we walked over the bridge  we had to walk in the right lane and it was dark. I put my head lamp on strobe and wore it backwards as the cars and tractor trailers flew past us. The bus ride to Richmond was painful and hard to sleep. We were on some smaller roads with lots of curves and bumps making to impossible to sleep. We smhaf a 3hr ride into DC which both if us slept well on even if it was very uncomfortable and we woke up every hour. When we got to Union Station in D.C. we missed the first two shuttles. We were looking for the van with matching color scheme from the advertisement. Ladybug and I found out that the trolley desined  busses were also out shuttle. So we have to catch the 2:40pm shuttle are both if us are going to kill each other after sitting on the curb for 4 hours.,"
