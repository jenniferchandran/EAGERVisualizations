Magic Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572285,"I'm sitting here on the bus after just leaving my family. The bus top was exactly that a bus stop in front of on a convenient store in a rough part of Salisbury NC. The bus was about 40 minutes late and then it was a rush thru my goodbyes to the girls and off i went. 
It still was very hard to pull away. My heart is still in my gut. There are pieces of me that want to turn around, go back home and forget the whole thing. 
Emotions are a very powerful thing but they do not define me or my decisions.  I know that I am doing the right thing at the right time. I know that there would be something wrong with me if I did not have these feelings of doubt and love for my family. I also know that I need to release those emotions so I can fully experience what lies ahead. I got 27 and half hours of just sitting to do it.
In Durham NC the bus filled up and I lost my double seat set up. I did get to share my row with an 80yr old grandma that feels the need to express her dislike about our chariot to her son at every stop. He gets to hear about it every 27 minutes. His response is always, ""I know"". Needless to say she is never riding on this bus again. At least she is a tiny grandma and not taking a lot of room next to me.

Delaware, I'm in Delaware. My ""chip on his shoulder"" bus driver said we have 2.5-3hrs before we get to NYC. The bus or the driver also seems like it's having a mechanical issue. Like the bus has the ""sup-sups"". My money is on the driver. We are 2hrs behind schedule and making my connector is looking bleak. Listening to the 2 guys behind comparing arrests, prison terms (yes, prison terms) and talking politics is enjoyable and scary at the same time. Needless to say they are not big Trump fans, but who is.?",,New York City,"Jul 13, Thu",0

11 Miles (Mile 5.2)
I made it to the top of Katahdin today. I'm 5 days into my journey, climbed 4000 feet and I'm still at mile 0. The AT actually starts at the top of Katahdin so yeah. 
The weather is perfect. Sunny with high white clouds. The view is spectacular 360 degrees. 
The climb was long and I am very thankful that a spent last year hiking thru Linville Gorge. My knees felt good and I was impressed with their performance. There was about an 2 hours of serious climbing that was very exposed. I am concerned with going back down. That will be the real test.

7:30pm
Well folks I made it but it was TOUGH! Not my knees themselves but the mobility, flexibility and trusting them to work. We did some crazy ass climbing as well. I have done my share of bouldering and scrambling but this was 2 miles and over 2 hours of scary, difficult climbing. Going down was even more stupid. But I made it and if I can do what I did today there will nothing too big for me. 
The two hikers I started out with today are not around tonite. HB the flip flopper finished before me and Josh had not made it back yet. I did meet another hiker and we staying together in his shelter tonite. His name is Phillip ""Sure Foot"" and he is 64 and he is a beast. We could be together until Virginia if we get along and keep roughly the same pace. 
You don't actually hike together with other people because everyone's fitness and effort is different. You may hike with several different people or groups during a day but the people you stay with at camp should be the same. I like Phillip and think we have a lot in common. 
I could not eat all my food I had packed for dinner. I guess it takes a little while for your body to adjust. Besides I put on quite a bit of fat before I left and I will have to burn that off first.
I'm tired and ready for it to get dark. Good night!

Day 2 Hurd Brook Shelter
Mile 18.6
I slept terrible last night. Uncomfortable and my brain trying figure out how to live efficiently out here. I need to make some adjustments to my gear. I also was pretty stiff this morning but not as bad as I thought.
When I rose Phillip and I noticed that Josh never made it back to the shelter. Before I left out for the trail this morning I stopped by the ranger station and his backpack was still there. This really is not a good sign because his whole life at the present is in that pack. I really hope nothing bad happened to him.
Today we hiked 13 miles. I hiked the first 10 alone as Phillip left out earlier than me. I was listening to some music and a song came on that reminded me of Joy. Normally I would try to fight thru getting choked up. But I was in the woods by myself and I let it rip. Being out here makes you realize how much you love your people.
Phillip and I met up at a rafting place that served food and beer at Abol Bridge. I had my last beer for 10 days because right after the bridge is the 100 mile Wilderness. There is a big warning sign posted about having enough food and not being to receive any help. What, wait. No help? 
The trail was relatively flat compared to yesterday but it's filled with roots and big rocks. It's like the forest is continually trying to trip you.
We made it to the shelter and we both put our tents up to keep the bugs off of us. The bugs are  pretty bad. It's like how they are at twilight all the time. They follow you down the trail for minutes. I figured out that if I cover my ears, they buzz by and move on.
My body hurts like the first week of crossfit and I smell awful. I imagine it will take a few weeks to build up endurance and conditioning but I think I'm going to stink for the next 5 months. I have also had to be creative with how I move around out here. I did not realize how much I kneeled out hiking before. I don't kneel now so I have to adapt and think thru things before I do them. I guess that is not all that bad.","Katahdin

Mile 31 (11.6 Today)
I was able to get a good nights sleep last and slept til about 6am. Phillip was up and was out around 6:30am. We planned on meeting at Rainbow Stream Shelter. I did not leave camp until 8am.

I started my hike and put some music on about an hour into the day. Just like yesterday a song came on that is familiar to my family and I just start balling. Again there is no reason to hold back and I think this might actually be good for me. When you do day to day life with the same people, you can really take them for granted. But when your gone and your putting body and mind thru hardcore training, you realize how much you love and need those people.

The trail today started with good pull (up a mountain) but was pretty flat for the rest of the day. The challenge today was about 50% of the Trail was so muddy your shoes would get stuck in it. So muddy there were puddles. And about 30% of the trail was filled with the same damn roots from yesterday. Very hard to make good time when your are having to dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge mud, roots and rocks.

There was a girl in the trail that got stung by a bunch of wasps. They came out of a tree trunk on the trail. In all my planning I had never thought about that happening. She was with a bunch of people and they were taking care of her.

I arrived at camp and Phillip was already there as well as 4-6 other middle aged men. One of them knew Coburn and the Hartsell family (small world). Phillip and I talked some about how we are hiking and about his history. He was in the Air Force and worked as chemical engineer for Exxon. He lives in Texas and from what can tell he has 2 kids. His youngest just graduated from high school and that brought him off the trail for a couple months. Glad to have him out here. We plan on staying together until he finishes somewhere in Virginia.

I don't feel like eating that much. Not sure what's going or what I'm going to do with my food. I'm not cooking at night. I guess after walking all day, putting up a tent, getting water, and getting organized I don't feel like cooking. It's also warm out so having a hot meal when you are sweating and have been all day does not sound appetizing.","

Mile 44 (14.6 today)

Today was tough on the feet. Just like yesterday it felt like most of the Trail was walking thru, over, around or on top on rocks, roots and mud. I had my first angry hike today because of the God awful terrain. Went as hard as I could for about 30 minutes over all that shit and then I was spent and not mad anymore.

Phillip and I hiked a lot together today. Good company and if one of us wanted to stop or go faster the other would just let them go . It works really well.

Believe it or not we crossed paths with some moms and their little bitty kids. Probably around 3 or 4 years old. Of course that triggered all kind of thoughts of my little ones and well you know by now what happens next.

I also stripped down to my undies and washed off in a secluded lake. This was right before I lost my shit on the trail. 

Our campsite for the night is good. Nice cool weather, flat and I seem to be figuring out systems for all my gear. The mosquitos are terrible though and got eaten up tonite. I can see them trying get into my tent as I write. 

Deep Thought
As I was walking thru the piece of shit trail today and complaining, I started to compare hiking the AT to life. With both you can pick your path, you can plan out how to attack it and you have kind of an idea what it's like. You expect the ups and downs and growing pains. 
But when stuff comes into play that you don't expect, stuff that is slowing you down, causing pain and more frustration, what do you do? You can quit and turn around and go back. That gets you nowhere in either situation. You can let it beat you down and let it drag on longer than it should. Or you can get pissed, put in your ear buds, get focused and fight thru it.","100 Mile Wilderness

Mile 60 (16 miles today)

Nothing real eventful on the trail today. I did get a chance to text Joy. It's so weird but it was uplifting to see her texts. My body is less stiff and today was long but easy day. Not a lot of climbing and dropping. Just a long mileage day for as green as I am.

My knees feel awesome! It is really unexplainable to hike especially down hill and not slow down or be in pain. It is truly a miracle.  I am able to climb and descend with equal ability. I am able to negotiate uneven and slick terrain. And I think I'm getting better.

Trail legs are a gift you get after hiking long distances daily. You not only are able go longer faster, your Neuro patterns in your brain begin to help you anticipate your next several steps. I do not have mine yet but am looking forward to them coming in. 

At camp Phillip and I had 3 other guys staying with us. GI Joe (retired army officer), Squach (big Penn country boy) and Not Yet ( California guy). It was cool to have conversations with new people. Not yet actually saw my Facebook posts about my backpack.

Today was a day of mile stones. We hiked further in one day than I ever have. We hiked more consecutive miles in 6 days than I ever have. And tomorrow will be out more days than I ever have.
It started raining on us about 30 minutes before we made it to our campsite. So we got wet and had to set up in the rain. I did well to stay dry during set up and as of 7:30pm. I'm tired and going to hit the hay.","100 Mile Wilderness

Mile 90 (14.5 miles)

Well today was supposed to be an easy day of 11 miles. Because of lack of water,(mistake of passing by 2 water sources and not topping off) we had to hike an extra 2 miles and we both have our tents set up on uneven ground. 
The day was harder than anticipated and those extra miles on top of 6 straight days of hard hiking beat us up pretty bad. We both ended up running out of water and that is scary out here. You need water.
I crossed my first River Ford (walking across a river with all your gear). The crossing was about 50 yards and the water only came up to our calves. 
I can't wait to get out of these woods. 2 days to go! This is a long time to be out with no civilization. I miss my family but the blubbering sessions have stopped for now.","100 Mile Wilderness

Mile 104 (14.2 miles)

Today I hiked my 1st 100 miles! Only 20 more to go! Other then that, more of the same. Steep up and downs and muddy, rooty flats. I'm so ready for a Zero day (a day when no mileage is walked). Our Zero will be in Monson. Just 10 miles away.

We are camped with a summer camp group of 6 teenagers and a couple other SOBOs. They are younger and faster than us but we already have our room reserved in Monson. 

Phillip and I get along really well and are helping each other with gear that the other needs. I'm so thankful to have a companion. We hike separately a lot but we always camp together.

White Blaze
All day long we follow white painted rectangles called blazes. They are on trees and rocks. Some of them are freshly painted and some of them are faded and barely recognizable. We search for these things like our life depends upon them, and it does. They guide us thru parts of the forest where the trail is not noticeable. They guide us over rocks and boulders. Without them it would be impossible to know where to step next at times. It would be cool to have something like this to guide us in life. Maybe it's truth.","100 Mile Wilderness

Mile 114 (10.4 miles)
Finally we made out of the 100 mile wilderness!!!! This was tougher than I thought. Physically and mentally grueling. My body's not used to hiking 15 miles a day. My feet definitely need a break. My back is tight and my whole boy is saying ""what the F"".

My mind and emotions go thru a 100 different moods a day. I get excited and feel accomplished when I reach the top of a mountain and finish the day. I get sad and sentimental when I think about my family and memories of our times together. 

I get mad and frustrated when I have hiked as hard as I can for as long as I can and still have 2 miles to go. 

Sometimes it feels like God is right over my shoulder and everything is going my way and sometimes it feels like God could give 2 shits what happens to me or how I'm feeling . 

My shoes fell apart after the first 50 miles. I had to keep super gluing them back. And I found out today they have ZERO grip on wet surfaces.

Today I woke up to rain hitting my tent. This makes everything we do harder. I got packed up in the rain and then it stopped. Then I ate and we headed down the trail. I felt like a baby giraffe on roller skates. We had 2 rivers to cross. This is called fording the river. I slipped and fell in one of them and slipped again hiking down a huge rock. All day was a lot tougher because of my piss poor footing. 

I lost a water bottle yesterday which left me filling up at streams twice a s much. And the one time we stopped to eat with all our food and bags out, it started raining again. It took 7.5 hours to hike 10.4 miles. In the hiking world that sucks. 

We made it though and I'm proud to say I have made it. Time to take a Zero Day and rest and resupply tomorrow.

Rest Day
Allow me to try to explain the Hostel experience. It is one of the important parts of the AT hiking experience. First of all, a Hostel is usually a huge house where people from all walks of life, who have a common passion and purpose, come to rest and recover from the beat down this trail throws upon you. Good hostels will have tent sites, a bunk house, the all important shower, breakfast, a place to relax, wifi, shuttle to and from the trailhead gear shop and food resupply.
People just come and go at random and you see people that you have past and others that past you. It's a traveling community.
When you arrive you are beaten down, thirsty, hungry, dirty, stiff and you stink to high heaven. The guy who brought you in offers you a beer or soda and you want kiss him square on the mouth.
Shawn Hostel is where I am staying after spending 9 days and 115 miles in the woods. These people take such good care of everyone. It's amazing. Personally, the owner Poet, drove just me 15 minutes to town to help pick out a pair of shoes. My shoes couldn't handle the Maine trail conditions and fell apart about 50 miles in. 
I had also contracted an eye infection and my doctor is in Spain and cannot help me. Poet's wife, Hippie Chick (you can't make this stuff up), says that the antibodies and stuff in breast milk can help and she so happens to be nursing. This story does not go quite as far as some of you are thinking. So I look it up and sure enough she is right. She puts some her milk in a cup and we treat my eye with it. Too many jokes here to even start. But I can't thank Shaw Hostel enough for going above and beyond to help people.
By the way, they don't look anything like their names would suggest.","

I sadly left the Shaw Hostel with my counterpart Phillip this morning and it really was hard to leave. They take such good care of you and the town and their people were just so cool. The weather was absolutely beautiful (75/50). But the hiker must move on.
I have decided to adjust a few things mentally and physically to help myself enjoy this journey. If you know me, you know that I am very structured and schedule driven. It helps me excel in my daily life. Out here in the woods, right now, not so much. 
I need to slow down and stop allowing hiking to ruin my hike. I have decided to not worry about the miles. They will come. I have set up break times, lunch and a rest time based off of hours not miles. Time is the only constant out here. Everything else is variable and unknown.
If you happen to get a text from me please answer it. It feels really nice to hear from all the people back home. If I don't answer it because I don't have service. And if you want to reach out please do. I would love to hear from my people.
So yesterday I felt clumsy and sluggish, I only have one contact in because of my eye infection, my back is tight and my olive oil leaked all over my food bag. No chicken dinner for me. 
By the way my eye infection is completely gone. 3 cheers for breast milk!","Monson, ME

Washed out the clothes and got them hanging on my pack to dry. We have two mountains in front of us today and I'm glad I feel better than yesterday. My back is still tight and I'm not sure what to do about it. 
Today was a much better day. We did have to climb 2 mountains today but my balance was better and my energy was back. My back is still bothering me. There was also as many blueberries as you could eat and I did just that. I must of ate 100-150 berries and I was eating them so fast I could not even create a pile in my hand.

Today was almost like a whole rest day. We got up early as usual and hiked 5.8 miles, got a ride to the B&B and we were checked in by 9:30am. I showered. Did I mention I really stink out here. Did my laundry, got a shuttle to lunch and it just so happens two of my favorite movies were on tv (this place is awesome and has satellite tv). Man on Fire and Gridiron Gang. 
I also picked wild raspberries today. I should be well rested for what lies ahead. 
I think my favorite part of this experience so far is the town days and the evenings at camp. The hiking is hard as hell and i enjoy the feeling of accomplishment but it is just a means to an end. Looking forward to getting those Trail Legs. Maybe a couple more weeks and things will get easier. This is still the coolest experience and I love it in a weird way.","

We left The Sterling Inn at about 9am. For some strange reason my attitude is good. In addition to counting hours and not miles, I have decided to look at every hike from town to town like weekend backpacking trips. I would be so excited about going out for the weekend. Now I get to do for 5 months. Changing the perspective can change how you function in life. 
After being attacked, followed, bitten and molested by mosquitos, flies and gnats all day long, I love to watch them bounce off my netting in my tent trying to get at me. 
We had our first Trail Magic this evening. Trail Magic is when people who are not hiking provide something to the hikers. These 2 older guys came walking up with plastic tubs, chat for a minute, and then offer us homemade cookies, muffins and cake. There were also some sodas in the box but since is was my first time I was not clear on how quick you needed to be.

Last night, like every other night, we end up staying with people going the opposite direction (Northbounders). These people are like Super Hikers. They have hiked 2000 miles and are almost finished with the AT. Getting their perspective on the trail that we have yet to hike is almost futile. Everything is easier for them now. Ups, Downs, Rocks, Roots, Mud, it does not matter. They are doing 20 plus mile/days and we are just getting to 12-15miles. They blow past you on the trail like freight trains. Can you tell I'm just a little envious.
Today I noticed I was peeing with one hand and eating jerky with the other. Wonder why I got an eye infection?
Well, I think I went through every emotion I have today. I was excited about our big climb. I was content sitting by a stream eating lunch. I cried for no apparent reason and then again when a song came on that reminded me of Mia. I was quite amazed at the view and gaining energy from wild blueberries. I was double trekking pole slam and an F bomb mad when there were several summits on this mountain. I was aggravated by all the damn bugs that seem to follow me for miles. I was relieved and proud when I made it to camp.
It's thundering out right now and word on the trail is rain is coming tomorrow. Phillip and I are getting up at 4:15am to try to beat it. You don't summit mountains when it's thundering and lightening.","

So it rained last night. It rained hard. It rained so hard that the the drops were spraying me from the rain bouncing off the roof. If someone would have offered to come get me, I would have been done. No damage and I made to Stratton, Yea!!! 
The hike today was 5 times harder because of the rain the night before. What was sure footing yesterday is now slick and you will go down. In fact, truth be told I went down 4 times today. The backpack saves your ass, but it's still scary. Downhill is the toughest in slick conditions so when you go down you go from on your feet to on your back.
The only place I have seen with more flies is Ethiopia. They seem to think I'm some big pile of dung. I hate them! And the gnats and the mosquitos. 
Today we climbed 3 peaks and descended over 2 miles and 2000 feet. This is the kind of hiking that we will have for the next month. Neither Phillip nor I are ready to do long miles with this, we will dial it back to about 10 miles a day.
When you climb huge mountains and pass the line where trees can't grow, there is always this cool inviting breeze. Today I sat at about 4000ft and ate Oreos and peanut butter looking out at what most people only see on tv or on a postcard. That is pretty stinkin' awesome!","

We are in Stratton. Today we rested and resupplied our food. I also worked on cleaning my clothes, pack and gear. I did some foot therapy and ate well.
Due to a weather front coming in tomorrow we are taking one more Zero day. It's a tough decision but if it does what they say, and what we have seen west of us is coming, we would not get very far tomorrow and end up taking a Zero day in the woods sitting in our tents. This is a much better option if you ask me.
Olivia just called me because she missed me. She was crying. I remember doing that with my grandparents when I would leave them. This is a tough deal and I want people to know that this no mid-life crisis or bucket list item. If that was the case, I would be home by now. I truly believe this journey is vital to the future of my family and hopefully a multitude of other people. I'm not sure how it's all going to come about. We will just have stay tuned to find out.","

It has looked like rain all day but only a sprinkle. This has made Phillip and I question our decision to stay. The forecast and the locals say we will still get thunderstorms tonight which is what we were trying to avoid. The good thing is that I am actually itching to get back out there. One day in the big scheme of things means next to nothing. Just sitting around all day makes you feel very unproductive. 
Lesson for the day: We all have to live with our decisions and we must make the best of them.
I got to video chat with my girls today. I love to see their faces. It reminds me why I'm doing this and how much I have been given. They are doing really well. Yard sales, Birthday dinner with Uncle Jophes and reward gifts for helping Joy around the house. Big things to come.","Stratton, ME

I ate lunch and got water at this awesome little camp site. I was kinda waiting on Phillip and he showed up feeling the same way but his heel was hurting him. 
We decided that we were trying too hard for mileage. Pushing ourselves too hard over rugged terrain and lots of steep climbing. Neither of us were having any fun and we were contemplating quitting.
So we set up camp right there in between a river and a stream.  It has perfect flat tent sites and  all our fellow hikers from today are with us. I think cutting back the miles is really going to help me do and feel better out here.","Stratton, ME

I felt much better today with shorter routes. These mountains are very tough even for the Northbound hikers. If you ever meet someone from Maine and they are a hiker, you need to shake their hand because they are a true badass. 
Tomorrow is not supposed to be good for weather. Rain in the forecast for the AM and thunderstorms in the afternoon. I have decided to expect the worst so I won't get crushed if it does not prove to be favorable. We will just have to wait and see.
You will probably get tired of hearing this, but l was listening to my playlist today and ""Last Christmas"" came on. The girls and I had a lot of fun with the chorus of that song last year.

Even though we had no rain, it did rain last night, so all surfaces were slick and wet. This makes for very interesting descents.
My day started hiking down a steep bank and rock hopping across a small but fast river. Remember I said everything was slick. Three steps in I went down. I ended up hugging that rock and then pulling myself up and just walking through the river. Shoes and pants soaked but pack and phone dry. 
I fell two more times today but I actually had a great day. We have been camping with another couple (Doc & Tinkle) and HB keeps showing up too. Today I made a great effort to stay with the group and did for most of the day. I like hiking with people, and Doc and Tinkle are really great. 
There is a beautiful pond at our campsite tonite. I got to lay my shoes and socks out to dry and then I found a rock-recliner that allowed me to even soak my feet. The sun was shining, there were no bugs and air temp was perfect. This was the most peaceful and thankful I've been on the whole trip. Thank You Big Guy!
We have a short hike into Rangely tomorrow and going to take a Nero. I do love the days in town. Town days are my favorite!","

Rangely Nero
We landed in our next town today. 4 miles in 2 hours. Then I had my first hitch-hiking experience. The guy who ended  up picking me up already had Phillip in the car with him. Phillip was about 15 minutes behind me and grabbed the driver at the parking lot and picked me up a half mile down the road.
Most of our day was spent resupplying our food (we had to walk a mile to the grocery store), cleaning out clothes and gear and making any repairs that were needed to our equipment. I had to sow my tent and tent stuff sack, and clean my water filter.
I had a very unsuccessful attempt at a video chat with the family due to the shotty wifi at the motel we are staying in. We are right on the lake though and it is beautiful. There is even one of those planes that take off and land in the water here. I was able to talk to Joy on the phone later and I felt a lot better.

Side Trail: Music 
I have a playlist out here with over 24 hours of music from all over the music map. I have noticed that certain music triggers different emotions in me. 
When a song comes on from one of the our family videos or reminds me of the girls my usual response is tears. When 80s hair bands come on I will look behind me to make sure I am alone and then I will break out a little rockin' roll lip sync. Trekking poles make great mikes stands or guitars. There is music that motivates me up mountains, like Fallout Boy or Rise Against. Then there are songs where I go ""so that is what they are saying"" or ""so that was that song was about"". There are songs that make me feel like I'm starring in my own movie and songs that make me think.
That's about all I have to say about that. I watched Forest Gump last week.","

We left Rangely at 8am this morning and headed South. I noticed today that after my 2nd shower in 14 hours my armpits still stink. That's stinky!
We are still hiking with Doc and Tinkle and I do like the company. We stayed together until lunch and then we got spread out. Phillip was able to stay with me for most of the day, which is good for the social game as well.
Long day of hiking, but my body and my mind are beginning to handle the load. My toes hurt from all the downhill. Just more growing pains. The bugs were awful. I wore by bug net for most of the day. They do not respect the repellent.
Setting up camp, cooking, and eating were done in record time to limit the number of bites and aggravation. However, I think they won this round.
I am in the safety of my tent watching all the bugs try to get at me. I was very careful not to let any in during my tent set up.","Rangley

Worst morning EVER! I slept well and at 5:30am started to get ready. I heard thunder in the distance and it started getting closer until it was right on top of us. A direct hit. It continued to rain for the next 2 hours. The tent held up well but this delayed us leaving almost 3 hours. The trail is now soaked and slick and hiking in the rain sucks. 
We started with a climb from hell, and even though it stopped raining, our effort and the humidity had us soaked and gassed in no time. I fell hard twice in about 30 minutes, so then I put socks on the outsides of my shoes to increase grip. A Bear Grylls trick. It took 3 hours to go 3.6 miles. 
Again I have to say, today was the worst day yet. It took another 3 hours to go 4 miles. Steep climbs and descents, rain on and off, slick rock and roots, ponds and streams on the trail. My shoes sucked. Trail runners do not grip. My counter parts had boots and could grip where I would slip. 
I asked God today to show me favor with the weather. And I never did get soaked by rain. I looked like it was the bottom was about to fall out all day and the thunder. Thundering in the mountains is scary. Thanks for the favor. I realize it could have been a lot worse. God, Can You help us stay dry tonite??","Bemis Stream

I got a pep text talk from my wife, stayed dry last night even though in rained and made it to the road into town by 9:30am. We are planing on Slack packing the next section.

I feel like God was with me today and yesterday, like I have not felt in a while. I had his favor with the weather and my attitude. 
We made it to our Hostel. The Human Nature Hostel. The owner just opened and he really was not ready to open but at least its dry and comfortable. He has been on Naked and Afraid twice, he was a Marine, and a thru hiker. 
We got to take a ""party bus"" to Walmart and McDonalds (Mercia). We were with 3 other hikers and we all were excited. It took about 20 minutes to get there and Yukon (Hostel owner) drives like a maniac, but for some reason I felt safe.","Small Stream

Mile 267 (10.1 miles)
This day is a tough one for me. Not being around for Mia's 10th birthday was one of my major considerations before taking on this adventure. I love you Mia and I hate I am missing your birthday today. You are so special to me and hope you have a wonderful celebration.
I called Mia this morning and my voice was shaking thru the the whole call. I hope she could not tell. She is having a lot of fun at her Aunt Jessica's farm.  She and her husband threw Mia a giant slip and slide party. I hike today for you, Mia.
......Made it thru today. we worked hard but having a Slack Pack again today made the effort much easier. I plan to slack pack as much as I can. Mentally today was tougher. Missing Mia's birthday today was harder than I thought. I tried to remember all her other birthday celebrations throughout the day. I drew strength from her today. 
Our hike tomorrow includes the most difficult mile on the AT. That's their claim anyways. We will also climb 2500 feet to start with. That's 250 sets of stairs. There is also a chance for rain tomorrow. I pray for Your safety and favor tomorrow. I ask for a dry hike and a dry camp set up. Can the rain just miss all the hikers in this area tomorrow?
I hung out with some younger NOBOs at the trailhead by the road this evening. There was an older man waiting for his wife to come down from where we have to go tomorrow. He also brought sodas, cookies, chips, and camping supplies for the  thru hikers. Trail Magic! I made dinner with and hung out with Steve while he waited. His wife came down at dusk but she made it.

Today was a milestone day. We hiked thru this canyon/gorge thing that had us climbing, going thru caves, and over huge boulders. Everything was slick from the huge rain the night before. We plodded our way for 1.1 miles and it took us 2 hours. Do the math, that is slow! They say this is most difficult mile on the whole AT. It was difficult but it was also fun. Like an adult playground  . . . except for you might die.
We hiked another 7.5 miles today and you could feel what the Notch took out of you. Plus the terrain in Maine is very rugged. That's the nice way of saying ""it sucks."" I have been stepping over, around, and through mud for 29 days. Thick, deep, black mud. Wanna know how I know it's deep? Well, the last day in Maine (Day 29) I fell in one pit. It sucked one leg up to my knee. I was able to pull myself out and was glad no one else saw. Maine.
Then, I'm about a 1/2 mile from the trail to the shelter, and I slip and go down hard . . . again. I slid about 15 feet down a rock. I was in no danger of falling off a cliff (Mom). I landed on my backpack and went for a scary ride. 
It's Phillips birthday today. No real celebration in the woods, but steak and beer are on me at the next town.

I noticed that when I'm in the woods I will have to pee once or twice during the night. But  when I'm in town I will go 4-5 times. I don't change the amount of liquid I drink but I go from straight water to beer, coffee, soda and a little water. That's all I have to say about that.
I say ""we"" a lot on my journal entries. Since day one I have been hiking with Philip (Sure Foot). We met on the way to Katahdin and have been together ever since. Philip is recently retired from Exxon and we have gotten a long really well. He is from Texas (outside of Houston) and has a wife and 4 kids.

Today was incredible as far as effort and views. We left the comfort of our Hostel and climbed Mt. Madison. This was labeled as our toughest climb in the Whites. We climbed around 4800ft today and roughly half was above the tree line over huge boulders. Think of the Star Trek episode when Kirk fought the Gorn. The wind was whipping around 50 mph at the top. It was crazy. I worked my ass off, but it's hard to compare what is the toughest so far. This was tough though.
As we descended there was another Hut in view. This one was much bigger. I knew that at the Hut was warmth, food, and and no wind. Remember the Huts are like lodges in the middle of nowhere. To stay in a bunk at this one costs $172 per night (breakfast and dinner included). Needless to say I'm in my tent about .25 miles from the Hut. We will at least get up in the morning and fill our water, go to the bathroom, and have a warm place to fix breakfast.
As we were setting up our camp we saw kids (20 somethings) coming up the mountain with big wooden packs on their backs hauling the food up for the people at the Hut. Their packs all weighed over 50lbs and they had a 4mile hike up the mountain. They are feeding 52 people tonight and in the morning.
I think the temperature will get way into the 40s tonite. This will test my gear as far as keeping me warm. I won't die, but it may get a little nipplely. 
I only slipped and fell once today. That's progress folks. The downhill fall is almost always broken by the backpack. Lucky me. Seriously, I feel good and am actually starting to enjoy the hiking part of this journey.","

Today will go down as my favorite day hiking so far. Now this does not include Zero or Nero Days but as far as just the hiking, today was awesome.
We started our day with the summit of Mt Washington. This is the 2nd highest peak on the AT topping out at 6288ft. It was 6 miles from our camp the day before and the whole hike was hopping from rock to rock. This makes for a very slow pace. Today I decided to stay with Philip for the climb.
We are literally above some of the clouds. It is foggy, windy and the temp is on the 40s. As we are hiking the fog would break up and then settle back in. During one of those breaks, the most dramatic, awesome scene unfolded. We could see all around us, the sun was peaking thru and clouds were still flying by us. I have never seen anything like it in my life. It actually caused me to tear up for just a second. I took a video but it does it no justice.
From there, the next thing I saw was the cog railroad. There was an actual steam locomotive going down the mountain. My dad would have peed his pants. I shot a video of this as well but again to far away to do it justice.
Next was the summit to Mt Washington. You have to google or YouTube this place. There is a weather observatory as well as a restaurant at the top. This peak is known for some of the worst and constantly changing weather on the planet. There is a recorded wind speed of 231mph. They have train, road, and trail access to the summit and there were 100s of people there. We ate lunch there (3 chili dogs, chili, and m&ms) and left for the rest of our hike.
After looking at the elevation map I decided that I wanted to see how hard I could go for 4.5miles. The terrain looked favorable, with not a lot of steep ups or downs. I made it in 2.5 hours and was pleased with my effort. 
We stopped at Mizpuh Hut for the night and I made it on the Work for Stay crew. So I have to do an hours worth of work in exchange for dinner and a place on the floor in the dining hall. It will be warm and dry. I wanted to at least try this option to see if I would do it again. These Huts are only in the Whites, but I will have a few more chances to do work for stay.","

Work for Stay was worth it. Last night I swept a floor and scrubbed a pan for as much home cooked food I could eat including chocolate chip bars and a spot on the floor. Pretty sweet deal. I could not fall asleep until about 10:30pm. My normal camp sleep is 6:00-7:30pm. 
The hiking was hard as usual, but my mind is accepting the challenges and handling them. Not to sound conceited, I have come to the conclusion that I'm pretty good at this backpacking thing.
Well not all that good . . . I broke one of my trekking poles today. They also serve as my tent support system, so these are kind of vital to my hike. We were coming up to a road with a store and visitors center, so I hiked a mile to the store but they did not sell trekking poles. I had lunch mulling over my options. Hitch into town, buy a wooden hiking stick, try to rig it. I went with that 3rd option and borrowed some channel locks and was able to rig with duct tape. It only needs to last 2 more days. Fingers crossed.
I did struggle in the social game today. Just like in real life when there are people involved, there will be drama, aggravation, and conflict. Today was one of those days where there was friction between the 4 of us traveling together, and 1 was getting under my skin. I'm no picnic all the time either, but this is not his journal or opinion, it's mine. I know it's hard to believe when life is really so simple out here (not easy, but simple), that you could actually disagree with someone else, but it's true.

You look at these non thru hikers as foreigners and invaders in your forest.

What a day to rest and relax. The weather is 70 degrees and perfect. The town is small but had everything we needed, including an awesome brewery and restaurant. As I was walking down the street after picking up a 4-pack of my favorite beer (KY Bourbon Barrel Ale) that I have not seen since I left my fridge at home, I heard a steam engine whistle. There is a small tourist railroad in the town. Trains were a part of my childhood because of my dad's love of them. This combo made me feel nostalgic, peaceful, and grateful. 
I noticed a few days ago that I'm going to have quite a few bad habits to break when I return to civilization. I will need to stop farting at will, blowing snot rockets, eating like a caveman, not flushing the toilet, not needing a toilet, randomly talking to myself, eating more food than a small family, stinking and wearing the exact same clothes everyday. I guess I can live it up while I can.
We leave out for the last of The Whites in the morning. 3 more days and we will be through, what is said to be, the toughest two states on the trail. We should hit Vermont in the next 5 days.

Philip is a good man. He has contemplated trying to go home but his wife said she has got it all under control (sounds familiar). JoAnna is a good women. Their house is not flooded and they are really prepared for these kind of events, so his family is safe and not in danger of flooding . . .  but I would feel the same way.
As far as hiking goes, we have just 2 more mountains until we are out The Whites. That means where a couple days away from some easier trail that will allow to hike more miles each day. We will still be in the mountains but the climbs will not be as steep or extreme. Hopefully we will be able to do 15-20 miles per day. 
I am really looking forward to being able to see my family, so that will now be the motivation to take it up a notch.

We climbed a big one today (Mt Moosilauki). This is the last climb in the Whites and we are going out with a bang. This mountain was steep and rocky. We gained 1800 ft in 1.5 miles. It had waterfalls following the trail for 3/4 of a mile. The rocky terrain was like trying to follow crazy and uneven steps that you have to figure out. 
I actually enjoyed the workout I got from climbing this mountain. I focus on my breathing and where I'm going to step next and I'm usually listening to My Playlist. This playlist has anything from James Taylor to Metallica and David Crowder to Iron Maiden. Music brings back memories for me and also pumps me up and focuses me.
When I'm hiking my mind is all over the place. Sometimes I'm totally focused on the hike itself. Paying attention to my pace, time, and effort. Other times I try to see how many Christmas' I can remember. On Mia's birthday, I tried to see if I could remember all her Birthday Celebrations. I think about my family and friends a lot. Sometimes I think about finishing the trail or hiking with my buddies from home. Other times I think about how far I have to go or setting up camp.""That's all I have say about that!""
The tears flowed today for a different reason. Today I cried out in awe and thankfulness as I climbed and followed that beautiful water fall and was listening to some of my favorite and inspiring tunes. The corner has been turned. God is good.","

Whenever there is rain in the forecast, I'm up early and trying to stay dry, and get as much mileage as I can before the rain hits. There was rain scheduled for today and I got on the trail at 6:40 am. By then time I got to the top of Moosilauki the wind was whipping and the sky was dark and fast moving, and so was I. I prayed to move fast, safe, and to stay dry. That's exactly what happened. For the first time I averaged over 2 mph and made it to the Hostel dry as a bone.
When I came off the mountain (the last damn mountain of the Whites), a lady was coming Northbound and congratulated me on finishing the Whites. I felt like I won the lottery. The music was rockin' and so was I! Hands in the air, lip syncing, and strutting down the trail.
The Hikers Welcome Hostel is a true Hostel. No private rooms, outside shower, laundry, and bathrooms. The shower was hot and felt great. It was cool to be outside and showering. We will get a ride to a general store and try to resupply for the next 3 days this evening. Next stop, Vermont!","

I hit the 400 mile mark today!! That sounds like a lot of miles until you compare it to what I have left. Let's just leave it at a victory for achieving 400 miles. 
Today we also met the Omelette Guy today. This guy fixes omelettes for every thru hiker on the trail. Amazing right?! He does it ""on"" the freakin' trail! You are walking and all of sudden he is there. The hikers we passed have been talking about him for days. He will make you an omelette with as many eggs as you want. Some dumbass asked for 30. The Omelette Guy made it and he ate it. He spent the next day at the Hostel in the bathroom all day. He also had corn muffins, juice, coffee and water. He said he read a few books about the AT and wanted to do his part. I had a 5 egg omelette.
Our first day out of the Whites went as planned, easy peasy for the first half of the day. We were cruising and making great time until we hit Cube Mountain. I miscalculated the elevation by 900 feet and we got our teeth kicked in. This little mountain acted like it was not going to let me reach the summit. Not a huge mountain but steep and long. In the end, victory was mine.
New Hampshire is still tough and we will have another tough day tomorrow. 3 mountains and almost 18 miles if everything goes according to plan.
At the top of the Cube there was an older guy playing the fiddle. The Bluegrass was so fitting with where I am. It was cool to hear that sound as I reached the summit.","

Our 18 miles turned into 20 because the lack of water at the shelter we were planning on stopping at. So I got my first 20 miler in the books. I hiked from 7 am until 6:30 pm. I'm feel fatigued, tired, my back is tight, my right big toe is sore because somehow I kicked it with my left foot, and my left Achilles started aching about 1 mile from finishing. But I also feel like a badass for accomplishing this feat of physical and mental endurance today.
Thought a lot about Joy, my wife, today. Lots of songs played that reminded me of her. I think about what she and the girls are doing, do they miss me, and I envision when we see each other again out on the trail somewhere. I love our life together and can't wait to just hang out on a Saturday and talk, have a couple good beers, steaks on grill, and watch a couple of our shows on tv. I love you Joy!
Tomorrow we have an 8.5 mile out into town Handover/ Norwich. They are calling for rain most of the day. If it would just hold off at least until we are packed up in the morning, that would be great. If you gotta walk in the rain the best time do it is heading into town. Let's be honest, Hiking in the rain sucks!

Like I told you before, when rain is in the forecast, I'm up and out early. I woke up to drops starting to hit my tent and then stop. I got ready fast. I did not even brush my teeth or poop. I was able to pack everything dry into my pack and was on my way. 
I actually said the words ""it's only 9 1/2 miles."" 9.5 miles would have max'd me out before the AT and surgery. I did the miles in about 4 hours. 2.5 miles was walking thru Handover NH and Norwich VT. Oh yeah, I'm in Vermont!!! The trail came out behind Dartmouth College. I walked thru town (picture Davidson College) and then over a river and interstate 93 into Norwich. 
We came through several pine forests and yellow flowered fields, which is significantly different scenery than what we have been seeing the past 6 weeks. This is a welcome change and this terrain also makes for easier hiking.
When you come out of the woods and hit a road, any road, there is a feeling of relief that you are not all alone and reality still exists. As I walked through the towns, I'm sure I looked homeless and was getting those kind of looks from the New Englanders in their pho-hiking clothes. But once I get into our room and take a shower, that actually brings me back to life, I feel like I'm part of society again.","

Philip does not know this yet, but I will try to sway him to come into town on ""football days"". Just kidding (not really).

I blew out another pair of trail runners. In just 350 miles they were coming apart and they never gripped well in the rain. So I bought some new low top boots.

Thistle Hill Shelter
Shelter 
Today and the rest of the week there was rain in the forecast. We have so many options for places to stay (towns, several shelters, Trail Magic places) that we decided to go and when we wanted or needed to stop we would.
We made it 13 miles today and are staying in a shelter tonight. No rain just tired and we heard some thunder. No rain and the forecast was for 100% chance of rain.  The mountains are smaller and you can go faster but they kick you in the teeth because you climb for a longer period of time. Climbing the mountains in NH and ME is like doing lunges and dips for and hour and climbing in VT is being on the treadmill at level 15. Both hurt you, but in different ways.
So this retired guy walks into an AT shelter. No this is not the beginning of a joke. He is from NY and among his many jobs he announces that he is a ""sexuality counselor"". Is that a real thing? His trail name is Super Mario .
Then there is the guy from Chicago who bought 30 McDonald's double cheese burgers and ate them on the trail for 6 days straight. This is a very cool idea to me. He also liked to build huge fires that have the shelter right under 800 degrees.
There is also the girl that showed up late. She started 2 days ago on some busted up ankles . We saw her this morning and she told us she was new and slow. She was right, but she made it to the shelter and she a great conversation starter. She is really interested in all of our trail experiences. 
Shelters are a very unique experience. People from all different walks of life lay in a wooden 3 sided building all together and sleep a foot away from each other. There is all kinds of snoring, adjusting, farting, coughing, sneezing, and headlamps go on and off taking place. Just like any other day, right.","

RAIN! Rain is the word for today. We hiked in the damn rain all day. All the clothes that I wore today got soaked. I found that wearing my rain jacket and climbing mountains doesn't do a bit of good. I was soaked from sweat in an hour. So I hiked the rest of the day in my shirt. My new boots worked well and kept my feet dry until my pants got soaked and dripped water into them. 
We walked about a half mile for lunch to a place that was listed in our guidebook. Unfortunately it is only open on Th, Fri, and Sat. Today is Wednesday. We were able to use their spigot to get water and sit on their porch to eat a dry lunch. 
We are staying in an old cabin. Just 4 walls, a loft and fire place but it's dry. Did I mention it's still raining! They don't have a water source here so we are collecting water off of one of our buddy's rain fly.","

Guess what?? We stayed dry today!! I was actually dryer and the end of the day than I was at the beginning. I started the day with damp clothes from the day before. As we started the day, it was foggy and cold. But we never got rained on. 
Every time we get to a shelter, Philip and I always have delusions that we will have the place to ourselves. We are always the first people there and we have never had the place to ourselves. Last night was no different. We ended up with 8 other stinky, wet and tired hikers including a couple that came in around 8pm and needed to set up, eat, and plan the next days hike while everyone else was trying sleep. Loads of fun!!
We got a motel room for the night and plan on a short day tomorrow and then slack packing the day after. Slack packing is when you only take food and water so your pack is light and the miles are easier to crank out. We leave all our other gear at the hostel. The weather is really unstable with rain in the forecast and this will put us inside in a bed for the next 3 nights. By the way, it started raining 5 minutes after we got to our room. 
I have watched all or parts of Forrest Gump 3 times since I've been gone. I'm sure it will remind me of my time on the trail when this is over. Phillip is my best good friend and we are like peas and carrots. That's all I have to say about that. Is it bad that I relate to Forrest out here?","

Yellow Deli Hostel (Rutland)

Ok, for days we have been hearing about the Yellow Deli Hostel from other hikers. They would say how cool, clean and inexpensive it was. Then they would all add at the end ""it's kind of a cult but they don't try to convert you or anything."" Well I was intrigued and inexpensive is my middle name. So we decided to stay at the YDH. 
The deli is next store to the Hostel and it is located right the downtown of Rutland. Rutland is slightly bigger than a town so the downtown has a very urban feel. It is very clean and decorated like a lodge. It is the nicest looking hostel I've been to yet. They give hikers 15% off in the deli, fix a free breakfast, free laundry, free shower and operates on donations. This is unheard of in my current world.
There is no smoking or drinking, no TV (deal breaker), no women where the men sleep, you must wear a shirt in the common area, you must be in by 10pm or you will be locked out (no exceptions) and the deli closed at 3pm today to observe the sabbath. You can tell that the workers in the deli and the Hostel don't ""quite"" fit in. All men have a 2 inch pony tail and the women are dressed very modest and wear no make up. Google ""12 Tribes"" if you're interested.
The food was great, we are dry (still raining on and off), and they are a block from Walmart. We will being staying 2 nights as we are Slack Packing 17 miles tomorrow. If you don't hear from me in a week send out a search party.
Philip and I caught a movie in town (Dunkirk) and had beer and dinner. They had a barrel aged stout that tasted like Dragons Milk. It was cool to sit in a theater and watch a movie.
There was a young man staying here that was wearing one Croc and one Flip Flop cause he lost his other Croc a month ago and happened to find a left Flip Flop in a hiker box. I laughed pretty hard when I saw it.","

Today I broke the 500 mile mark!! I feel good and right now I like what I'm doing. There has not been one day where something doesn't hurt, but overall I'm stronger than I have been this whole trip. I hear NOBOS talking about being sick of the Trail and just wanting it to be over. I do not want to feel like that.
I'm still alive and have not been offered koolaid yet. This is a very cool place and we have definitely found it very valuable to our hike.
We Slack Packed 17.5 miles today in about 8 hours. That is pretty fast. We are not the fastest hikers by far, but anytime you can average over 2mph, you are doing good. I forgot my headphones and I usually listen to music or a podcast for a couple hours a day. This made hiking a little more challenging and mundane.
All over the forest in Vermont there are old stone walls about 3-4 feet high and sometimes stretch for hundreds of yards. We asked a local about them and were told they are property boundaries that were used 100s of years ago. We were also told that if you get caught taking them you will be fined $500.","

As we leave for the trail today I find it hard to be focused on my journey with hurricane Irma hitting Florida. My mom and sister and many friends are in the direct path of it.

I pray that they are safe and that damage in minimal. I love you guys very much and feel helpless and selfish for being out here. Stay strong!
Today was filled with thoughts of my mom, sister, and friends in Florida. Right now I'm in the woods (of course) and have no cell service. So I have no way of knowing what is happening with hurricane Irma. 
Today also marks the 1st Sunday of the NFL season. I have not missed this awesome event in at least 25 years. To tell you the truth I am really missing sitting in my living room, drinking some beer, eating junk food, and watching as much football as one man can stand.
I noticed that for no particular reason most women thru hiking the AT stop shaving their legs. That's all I have to say about that.
As far as the hiking goes, we had a beautiful, cool day to hike with no rain. This was the first day in 5 days that there was no rain. We are also seeing the leaves start to change color. It would be cool to hike south in a perpetual fall for the next month.","

Today hiking was easier than yesterday and we did 5 more miles today. You just never know how you feel, what the trail surface is like and of course the weather. We actually ended up climbing Bromley Mountain and there were several ski slopes at the top. And the AT followed one of the slopes for about a 1/10 of a mile.
Our world out here is measured in tenths of miles. It's on our maps and how we talk to each other. 1/10 of a mile is about 160 yds. Sometimes it takes 2 minutes to go a tenth, and sometimes it will take over 5 minutes. I prefer the 2 minute ones.
I thought a lot about my mom and sister today. They survived the hurricane but I don't know how my mom's house is. She lives in a retirement trailer community. Probably not good when it comes to hurricanes. I'm just happy they are alive and well.
I also thought about the football season going on without me. My daughter Olivia texted me to tell me they watched football and the Bills won. That made my day. 1-0 and in 1st place in their division. Going to the Super Bowl!!! A man can dream.
Today as I was finishing my hike off there was a 200-300 foot climb. I was listening to my playlist and really wanted to finish off strong. Right as I was hitting that last climb I asked for a song to pump me up. I got Skid Row- Slave To The Grind. This is a 100MPH with your hair on fire 90s heavy metal song. I went as hard as I could (Fran pace for all my Crossfit friends) and reached the top of the mountain just as the song was ending. The climb finished at the above mentioned ski slope. I felt like a bad ass. A winded bad ass, but still a bad ass.
Graphic Content Disclaimer: Philip farts more than anyone I know. I know that says a lot coming from me, and knowing my father very well, but it's true. No exaggeration, he must have farted 20 times in 15 minutes today. I'm glad he always hikes behind me.","

I have now completed 25% of the AT. According to everyone we talk to we have done the toughest parts of the trail. We still have to work hard, but mentally this fact strengthens me. When I started, everything made me nervous. Fear of the unknown is powerful.
I was nervous before I left home, Katahdin made me nervous, the 100 mile wilderness made me nervous, Southern Maine made me nervous, the Whites made me nervous. As I completed each one of these I grew in confidence. Now I just look at it like another mountain. I still respect the trail, but I do not fear the trail. I even find myself smiling as I climb or excited about a steep descent.
Physically, I started the trail at 170lbs. Today I weighed myself and I weighed 154lbs. I have not been this light since high school. My body feels strong and I am in good trail shape. I have my aches and pains. My calves get tight, my feet hurt, my ankle aches and sometimes my back hurts. None of this happens all at once or is it enough to stop me from moving forward.

Today the most eventful thing that happened to us occurred around lunch. Philip and I were looking for a place to have lunch and we came upon this beautiful pond. As we rounded the corner there was a guy sitting on a rock by the pond. Upon further observation this guy was naked. Yes naked! He was wearing a ball cap, but that was it. We walked by him awkwardly and noticed there was a clothed guy there as well. Come to find out from the guy wearing clothes (who was a thru hiker) that this guy was hiking naked. Yes naked! He told our fellow hiker that there we no laws against him doing just so. That's all I have to say about that.
In other news, we left the Green Mt. House and we both agreed that it was our favorite Hostel so far. It was so clean, organized and the people who ran it (Jeff and Duffy) were great. They had free Ben & Jerry's ice cream, took us into town and the trail head at no charge, and had a DIY breakfast with eggs, pancakes and coffee. There were cool trail posters from all over the country on the walls and they had an excellent DVD selection and good wifi. Two thumbs up!
Philip and I have been hiking a lot together lately. We talk about sports (he likes baseball and I'm a football fan), politics, rank hostels, motels and B&Bs, discuss our days strategy, try to figure how long it will take us to get to the next state, the end of the trail for Philip, and the end of the trail for me. Philip will be done in Dalesville VA and I will have about 730 more miles to go. We talk about the people we have met on the trail and in town. Some we like and some we don't.

Today was rough. About 2am it started raining. The rain did not stop until 9:30am. This is the remanence of Irma. We started hiking around 7am in that rain.
Rain changes everything. The bushes and small trees are wet and like to give you a mini shower as you go by. The rocks and roots are like ice. We were having to dodge a lot of mud holes and these are now deeper and more muddy after the rain. Your morale also changes. We both became quiet, negative, and tired in a matter of hours. I did not have any drive or speed today.
So with the rain coming down fogging and speckling my glasses, the roots and rocks trying to trip and slip me up, the bushes and roots grabbing at my hiking poles and the fatigue that both of us are feeling, we decided it was time for a Zero (rest day). We have not had a Zero in 2 weeks and we both could see and feel the effects of that.
With rain in the forecast for the next 12-24 hours we decided to pull up short of our goal today and stay in a shelter about 10 miles from our road to town. This is the wise decision but does not sit well with my goal oriented self. But we will stay dry tonight, and be able to take advantage of all the things town has to offer tomorrow. Town is still my favorite.
At about 6pm two more hikers come upon the shelter. We thought we just might have the whole place to ourselves. Delusional. These two guys that showed up have been leap frogging with us for weeks now and we know them fairly well. Astro and Not Yet are two young guys from Virginia and California. They met on the trail, like Philip and I, and have been hiking together for a while now. There is a handful of people on the planet who are going through the same things at the same time I am and these are two of those people. We had a great time exchanging stories from the the trail (like the naked guy) and from town. We mainly talk about food when we talk about town. We can really relate to each others lives out here.

About 20% of people who start AT actually finish.There are 387 hikers registered as Southbounders (that's me) in 2017. That means about 76 hikers going south will finish.There about 3100 hikers registered as Northbounders  in 2017. That means about 620 hikers going north will finishThe elevation of the entire AT would equal climbing Mt Everest 16 times. Just a perspective not a challenge or comparison.There are about 165,000 white blazes marking the trail. About 3 of them are in New Hampshire (not official)Hikers loose an average of 30lbs while hiking the trail. I have lost 16lbs so far.25% of the hikers are women.

On this well deserved Zero Day, Philip and I went to breakfast at Friendly's. Friendly's is like a Dennys that has ice cream emphasis. Well, I decided to have ice cream for breakfast. 1200 calories of ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, peanut butter, Reece's, peanuts, and a cherry. Do Not Try This At Home. Only as A hiker would I even consider this. We burn about 6000-7000per day out here and only eat around 3000. I know my daughters would be jealous. 
There is another hurricane (Jose) that can effect our hike, not mention the damage it could do to the northeast. We have been feeling the mild effect of Harvey then Irma over the past two weeks. Even though rain is a back breaker to a hiker, it's not like dealing with loosing your home or life. My heart goes out to all those affected by these storms. I'm going on record and asking God to swing all hurricanes out into the deep sea where they will affect absolutely no one. So be it!
Fall has been coming in the New England area for about a week or two now. I have never lived in the woods during the leaves changing (duh), but the daily change is amazing. You can see more and brighter colors every time you catch a view of the mountain ranges. I love fall for so many reasons and seeing this gives me comfort and energy. We just need to see this beauty without the RAIN!! Go Bills!! Just thought I would throw that in there.
Today we needed to resupply at Walmart. We had a ride lined up with the motel owner and were going to take the bus back. But the owner asks if we wanted to take his truck. Ahhh? Yeah! That was a shocker to both of us and one of nicest things we have experienced thus far. I haven't driven in 2 months and felt great not to have to rush or depend on a ride. We filled the truck up with gas to show our gratitude. I haven't pumped gas (at a gas station) in 2 months either.","

Goodbye Vermont. I tried hard to like you with your smoother trail surface and smaller mountains. But you tried to be a Mini Maine at times and rained on us 8 out of 12 days. I would come back and hike you again which is more than I can say for Maine.
The AT goes through towns and neighborhoods from time to time. At the end of our hike today we walked out of the woods and into a small town (North Adams MA). As we looked for a place to camp we ended up just in the woods again,  directly on the trail and literally just beyond the back yards of some neighborhood homes. We are less than 20 yards from their back yards. We can hear grass being cut, kids playing dogs barking, cars going by, a few airplanes taking off from a small airfield and the occasional train.

Today I crossed the 600 mile threshold!!! I feel really good! Let me rephrase that: there is always something that is sore, aches or hurting, but my body and mind are able to handle the trail that lies in front of me each day with passion. I like it.
Today's hike was freaking tough. There is some sort of heatwave in the northeast and it is very humid. I swore more today than I have any other day on the trail I can remember. Maybe it also had something to do with the over 3000ft of elevation we climbed in one big chunk. Greylock Mountain is the highest elevation in Massachusetts and today she was ours to climb. 
One thing that made it easier is that we had trail magic waiting for us at the summit. A lady that Philip and met way back in Monson ME reached out to us on Facebook and asked if we would like her to meet us with drinks and food at the top of Greylock. DUH!!! YEAH!!! She had to come off the trail due to chronic knee and foot problems and still wanted to be a part of the AT. She really took care of us and whenever anyone out goes out of their way to help you, it's very special. It's hard to express the gratitude I feel when people reach out to help me. Since I live a couple hours from the AT, I plan on reaching out and paying back what has been so graciously given to me.
I'm sitting at a picnic table in the shade at a church waiting for Philip arrive. There is a slight breeze and the air in the shade is very pleasant. I'm sitting here so thankful (actually thanking God) for all that I'm experiencing and all the favor that has been shown to me. I hate to break it to you but I think he likes me a bit more than all of you. Just sayin'.

This is the 2 month anniversary of my start date on the Appalachian Trail. Man I have come a long way literally and figuratively. I have gone from hating hiking and wanting to quit everyday to actually loving the lifestyle and challenging myself everyday. I even test myself at the end of most days and see how fast I can do 4, 8, or even 10 miles. I have gone from not being able to utter my wife or girls' names without breaking up, to being able to cover up how much I miss them.
This is our 3rd day is Mass. and so far we have stayed behind someone's back yard on the trail, in a church parking lot a 1/10 off trail and in a motel. We have walked thru 3 towns and I absolutely love it. Fall is on the air, people are decorating for Halloween and Thanksgiving, and this really reminds me of home and family. I will say again this is my favorite time of year and if I can't be home, I'm able to get a taste of it walking thru these towns.
Tomorrow we are slack packing 19 miles. Allow me to explain slack packing. Many times the trail will run between two roads. Say there is 19 miles of trail in between the two roads. We will drop most of our gear off with a shuttle driver and we will hike the 19 miles with just what we need for the day (food, water and rain gear). This will make our packs less than 10lbs instead of 25-30lbs. The driver will bring our gear to the second road where we will meet him and we will pick it up and continue on. I know, I had to do it one time to get it myself.

Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Well, today we did over 20 miles. It was probably the flattest terrain we have hiked yet. Not much to talk about as far as the hike goes. We slack packed but it was still tough. No real great views or awesome scenery. No milestones or new states. We just hiked. 
I listened to a lot of podcasts today. I have downloaded some deep thought provoking stuff and some straight up mindless entertainment ones. Today was more educational and philosophical. It made me think more about what the future holds for me and my family. We are definitely in a season of change and I want to embrace that change. And I definitely have the time to figure and plan. Lookout world! Who knows what the next Switalski chapter will look like.
We are staying in a cabin tonight. This is a one of a kind on the trail. It's like a real house (without running water or power) but with a caretaker couple. They have a different couple stay every week thru hiker season (May - Oct). They will make us breakfast, had water gathered, and we have a nice bunk to sleep in. Massachusetts has given us the best in accommodations thus far. We have stayed in a backyard, church parking lot, motel and a cabin. I'm getting soft.","

Today was for whatever reason a better day for me hiking wise. Our scenery changed a lot today. We would go from thick forest to less dense pine woods to pastures to meadows and even a few farm houses sprinkled in. I enjoyed the day today and made good time as well.
The weather had been unseasonably warm and humid ( low 80s and 90% humidity). Which drives me crazy. The sweating, stinking and bug population are all on the rise. It looks like several more days like this before a cool down happens . I can't wait.

All these came back to back!
I met another southbounder a few days ago at the church we stayed at. Then I saw him again at the sub shop in town on our Nero. And he was at the cabin we stayed at last night. So I guess he deserves to make the journal. His name is Coffee Break and this is his 3rd attempt at hiking the trail. He is 40 years old and likes to do big miles. He also like to hang out in towns for 2 or 3 days. This kind of evens things out and puts him at our pace. I like him because he and I have the same sense of sarcastic humor. We got along well and I was able to cut and pick on him like some of my boys back home. It felt cool to able to do that.
I had to collect water from a questionable source today. It was stream outlet for a beaver pond. It was the only choice before heading into camp. The water at camp was a pool with a frog and caterpillar floating in it. Philip bypassed the pond and used the frog water. I filtered it and boiled it and even put a couple drops of stove alcohol in it. Better to be safe than have the trots or the earls. Am I right?!
Heading into town again tomorrow and going to take a rest day as well. You can feel your body start to breakdown, things begin hurt and you aren't able to go as far or as fast as your did a couple days ago. Philip and I are not spring chickens, so we have to be smart if we want to continue to move down the trail. I will also get to partake in watching college football on Saturday again! It's a win/win.","

Monument Mt Motel
Taking a rest day today. Today I talked to my mom, dad, wife, and daughters. I ate a lot of food and watched even more football. When we rest, we really don't want to do much and we succeed in not doing much.
We are in Barrington Massachusetts which is at the base of the Berkshire Mountains. It's a tourist town and we have seen a lot of people from the hotels going to weddings. In tourist towns food and accommodations are more expensive and the towns usually are not as hiker friendly as a ""hiker"" town. They did have a good brewery like every other town I've had the privilege to stay in. Having good beer makes the hike so much better. But good beer makes everything better.
The weather has been hot and humid for the past week and it will continue for the next few days. We already get up before the sun to take advantage of cooler mornings and are going to attempt any 20 mile days until the weather breaks in our favor. Remember this is a long ass marathon not a sprint.
Yesterday I drank water from 3 questionable sources and have lived to tell you about it. First was a stream that was an outlet for a beaver pond. Second was a somewhat boggy stream. And third was from a river that had a sign posted (that I did not see at first) reading that the river was contaminated. Great right? I'm a good hiker, really I am! 
Needless to say, water was not in great supply yesterday and you don't know that in advance. You just have to deal with it as it comes. Kind of like having to deal with a traffic jam you weren't expecting, only different. That's all I have to say about that.","

I have never sweat so much in my life as I did today. My shorts and underwear were soaked and dripping. My shirt was like I just jumped in the pool. Every time I drove my trekking poles in the ground sweat dripped off my forearms. My buff was soaked and leaking on to my glasses. But I made 14 miles in about 6.5 hours. I drank 5 liters of water before 3pm. Today was better than yesterday because mentally I decided to attack it instead of bitch about it.

We are staying in a very small town behind a restaurant that only opens for lunch Thursday thru Sunday. They are hiker friendly though and let us tent and use their hose tonite. In this town there is the place we are staying, an Inn that starts renting their rooms at $260 a night, an auto repair shop and a packing store (alcohol). The Inn has a restaurant that opens at 5pm and I have taken full advantage of the packing store. We will eat and retire to our backyard tents in hopes that tomorrow will be less sweaty than today. 

My air mattress has a hole in it. I have tried to repair it twice and not sure I got it. I will know if I wake up on a deflated piece of fabric on the hard ground. I also will be running very low on food for our 14 mile hike tomorrow. Philip is low too, and there is no where to buy food until we get to town. We are just going to have to suck it up. Combine these with the heat and normal aches and pains and it's safe to say it pretty much sucks being a thru hiker right now.","

Mile 711 (14 miles)
The pain and aggravation of Maine may be too far behind to judge accurately, but I have to say toady was my worst day on the trail. 
Starting last night when I was visited twice by a skunk. Just after it got dark I saw him saunter (wobble/ strut) toward my tent. Without thinking I shouted "" GET OUTTA HERE!!"". I'm lucky he didn't spray me. He stared at me for a second and then turned around and left the same way. About 15 minutes later he returned. This time I shined my headlamp at him and he left. Needless to say I slept with one eye open.
When I got up I immediately noticed that my tent, sleeping bag, and everything that was not in a ziplock bag was soaked. It was so humid that dew and breath had been soaking the inside of my tent. I felt like it rained in there. We had to pack up all of our gear heavy from being wet.
Both Philip and I were low on food. I had two Twinkies, a serving of Doritos, and 2 servings of beef jerky. We had 14 miles to hike and water has also been scarce do to lack of rain for the past two weeks.
It quickly heated up and the humidity was thru the roof. The bugs started buzzing around my head. They were relentless and multiplying. At one point there had to be 100 around my head. What do they want??!! This brought me to screaming, yelling, and cussing at them. They would stay with me for miles and if I stopped they would decrease but as soon as I started moving they were right with me.
All that being said, I made it to town and Phillip, having experienced a similar day, suggested we take tomorrow off. The weather is supposed to be the same but with the added feature of afternoon showers. This will make me stronger and more enduring, but damn it sure does suck when you go through it.
Oh yeah, I hit the 700 mile mark somewhere today. Whoopie!!","

What a difference a day makes! After taking another Zero because neither Phillip nor I wanted to survive another day in the heat (which was record setting btw) we set out early to get back on the trail.

We had a breeze and the air was not thick anymore. We had breakfast at the general store, got a hitch to the trailhead, and we were off. It felt soooo much better to hike today. We stayed together and were chatting and missed a turn. Amazing huh?!

Well we hiked about a mile before we realized it and both Phillip and I hate to backtrack. So, we checked our maps and and kept walking and intersected the trail after about 4 miles. This is probably not exactly legal, but I'm not a legalistic type of guy. We have hiked more than our share of trail miles that will never count and I am good with our alternative route. Just keeping it real.

My afternoon was awesome! It was a pleasure to hike the trail today. As I was hiking out to a section of road, there was an older guy in front of me out for a while and I caught up to him. As we were talking, he offered to take me to a store where I got a sandwich, popcorn, and a beer (Pumpking). He even took me back to the trailhead. Thanks Richard.

When I got to the shelter and was setting up my sleeping area, I heard a noise in the field next to me. I looked and saw a little whitetail deer walking around. We stared at each other and I got a quick video. Perfect ending to a great day. 

It's very rare that all the elements of hiking (body, mind, weather, trail) converge to make for a perfect hike. This afternoon they did.

Oh yeah, I am officially one third of the through the trail at 730 miles. I could have not made it this far alone. Lots of people have helped, supported and prayed for me thus far. Thank You!","

Today we left Connecticut and entered New York!! This is state number 6 out of 14. But more significantly, we have left the New England region!! No more Tom Brady pictures in restaurants, no more Patriots gear in Walmart and convenience stores, no seeing other people walk around sporting there Patriots gear.

We are now in the home of the Jets, Giants, and my beloved Bills! Home of NYC & Niagara Falls. Home of the Buffalo Wings and Real Pizza. Home of the deli. Speaking of delis, we are now on the Deli Tour 2017. Throughout NY and NJ there are many delis scattered close to or even on the trail. Just this week we will encounter 4 of them. This is a positive in many ways. First of all, the obvious getting to eat real food while you are hiking. More calories and better taste. Secondly, we can go further with less food which means less weight in our packs. And we will not have to worry about resupply of our food as often. Plus it make your hike more interesting. I    NY!

I saw three deer today. The one from last night came back this morning and brought a friend and I saw a much bigger one crossing one of the roads that I was crossing. It's pretty cool to see them and how we trust each other enough just to hang out and do our thing in close proximity to one another. On another note, hunting season starts in 2 days and so I'm sure all that trust will be gone.","

Under the eve

Have I told you how much hiking in the rain BLOWS?? Well in case I haven't, it does. It rained last night, but it stopped and we did not have to breakdown camp in the rain. About 30 minutes into the hike it started raining again. 

Our first stop was our 3rd Deli in as many days. It was 7 miles into the day and it rained pretty much the whole time. There is also a pizza place next store that doesn't open until 12:00 and I got here at 10:30. Because of the rain and I was counting on this place for 2 meals I decided to wait it out and Philip moved on. 

A guy from the pizza place drove me back to the trailhead. He was very cool but a classic New Yorker. Joey ""Bagodonuts"". He left me with 4 ""Forget about its"" during our 3 minute ride. 

We made it to this park/beach that is closed for the season. We are camping under an eve at the park headquarters and yes it is still raining even though there is no rain on the radar. If the wind changes on us we are screwed. The alternative would have been to put our wet tents on the wet ground while it's raining. That would not have given us any better protection from the stupid rain.

We have now moved picnic tables on their side in front of our sleeping area to block wind and rain in case it changes direction. Those damn things were heavy. Better safe than sorry.","

All that coupled with my low back being tight and sore, missing another Sunday had me wishing I was home with my family watching football and drinking beer.

On a positive note, we hit our 4th and final Deli this week. This one is actually on the trail and had football playing inside. Needless to say I grabbed a beer and hung out for an hour. God does love me and takes care of me when I need it.

Today was one the most unique days I have had on the trail yet. I ran the full range of emotions from gratitude to rage, from pain to comfort and from impressed to depressed.

Our morning started out like most with a climb and descent. My back is tight and painful going up hills but the beginning of the day is better and it felt better than it did yesterday. As I came down the mountain and hit the road it was really busy. People on their way to work. We realized pretty quick that we were crossing the Hudson River. It's a huge river with a huge bridge and the view was incredible. Pictures never do it justice. 

Once we crossed the bridge the trail led us into a zoo. Yes a zoo. This happens to also be the lowest elevation on the AT at 167ft. There were hawks, eagles, fox, wolves, a bear and a but load of buzzards. All the animals were injured and in rehabilitation. The zoo actually was closed so when got to the end we had to go back and walk around due to locked gate. It burns me up to have to do useless miles out here but I'm glad I got see the zoo.

Next we had to climb Bear Mountain. This is the first big climb we have had in a few days. This area is like a big park with an inn, a lake and of course the zoo. We stopped at the bottom and hit the vending machines to fuel up and we started our climb. They had built a display of all the different trail surfaces on the AT. Philip and I actually made fun of the display at first. As we continued to walk we noticed we were ascending on stone steps. Nice stone steps. These steps took us 3/4 of the way up the mountain. It was beautiful and impressive. I have never seen that amount of effort put into climbing a mountain. 

When we got to the summit there was a stone tower that we also climbed and you could see New York City on the horizon. We hit the vending machines at the top of the mountain and left for the trail. The same stone work going up was in the back side of the mountain all the way down. Spectacular! 

About an hour later on the trail I got off trail for over a half a mile. Which means I had to backtrack to the spot I missed. Remember what I said above about useless miles. Well this one was self induced and that makes it even worse. 

Heading into town tomorrow. It's been seven days since we stopped and I'm ready. We have about 18 miles to go and water is going to be hard to find. Lots of dried up streams and we think our first source is not until 14 miles.

Almost forgot, I crossed the 800 mile mark today. About 1300 and something to go.","

Yes, it broke me up but it also rejuvenated me. I felt really special to have all those people reach out. So, thank you to all those who took the time to write (even you, JME)! I love you all.

Last night we stayed in a state park and got a visit from a police officer around 9:30. He was looking for 2 teenagers that had run away and maybe suicidal. Sad story, yes, but at least he wasn't there for us. The funny thing is, with my earplugs in, I slept through the whole thing. Philip had to tell me about it in the morning.

As far as the hike and the trail go: Today was a tough 17.5 miles. We had some really steep climbs and descents, but we made it to our town and our motel. We will be taking tomorrow off and resting up. My feet took a beating the past 6 days. Athletes foot and some blistering on my left foot. I thought my feet were already toughened up.","

This may be my longest day yet. Mileage wise I think I may have done this much, but time wise I walked from 8:30 am to 6:30 pm and got to the shelter as the sun was setting. Needless to say, I'm exhausted and amp'd up all at the same time. It was warm and humid all day and they are calling for thunderstorms tonight. I'm glad I made it to the shelter. Unfortunately, Philip did not make it. He is staying a couple miles back and will catch up tomorrow.
I also made it into New Jersey! Another state in the books. Leaving NY behind was not that tough. Our motel was not a great experience and Warwick was pretty expensive. Also, the cab driver that took us back to the trail head was a complete ass. I forgot my phone and we were literally 2 minutes down the road when I remembered. He was pissed and drove like a maniac the rest of the way. New York.
Other than hiking hard today, I was interviewed by a guy I have seen the past 4 days. He is slack packing and is hiking to raise money for a homeless shelter. We had talked about my knees and he asked if he could interview me about it. I will post it on Facebook soon.

I also have not seen or heard from Philip since last night. My hope is that he will either show up at the shelter tonight or I will see him in town tomorrow. I also hope that our hiking team is not disbanded. Only time will tell. If I want to finish by Christmas then I have to average 16 miles a day 7 days a week. If want to take time off (and I will need to take time off) then I have to do more than 16 miles per day.
I crossed paths with my buddy Astro today. We talked and shared quite a bit about our adventures on the trail. He is one of the few people on earth that know exactly what I'm going through. And he is a pretty cool kid.

But when we got to the town, with only 2 motels, one of them was closed and the other was completely full. So we did what any red blooded man would do, asked our ride to drop us off at the tavern.
Once we got inside we ordered lunch, a beer, and put a different plan together which required us to hike another 3.5 miles to a shelter. We ordered another beer and watched some college football. Then we ordered food to go for dinner and resupplied for tomorrow with snacks from behind the bar (cookies, peanuts etc.)
I have met a kid from Concord (my home town) and he has been with us for about 3 days. His name is ""Good Feelin"" and is 23 yrs old and a UNCC graduate. It has been really nice to talk to someone who knows about stuff at home. I miss home a lot. Good Feelin' is heading south as well and will be finishing in Hot Springs VA.
Last night ended up being really fun. When we (me and Good Feelin) got to the shelter after missing a turn that cost us a mile, there were 2 weekend hiker, Jersey Boys there. Not hardcore Jersey, but you could definitely tell where they were from. They want to hike the AT bad and they were so enamored with hearing our stories.

As I was hiking today I came up with a killer idea for a ESPN commercial and a good idea for future endeavors when I get off the trail. I want to share this experience with as many people as possible and help those, who really want to change their life, find the way to do it.
I took a spill today on a slick rock. Nothing out the ordinary there but when I fell my foot got pinned under me and my knee had to bend way further than it has. My heel touched my butt. I actually saw myself for a second lying on the ground cussing in pain. I took a deep breath and slowly stood up. As I took my first steps everything seemed to hold together so I kept going. My knee is a little sore now, but I think I'm ok. That's all I have to say about that.","

Today was incredible and awful.  I felt strong and defeated. We had to deal with the remains of yet another hurricane (Nate) that dumped rain and wind on us all day today. Couple that with the already muggy conditions and we had the perfect combo to break Magic Legs in half. But guess what? I can't believe I'm going to say this, but most of the hike today I was having some type of crazy, deranged fun out there. 
For 11 miles (4 hours) I walked in a wet, sloppy mess. I have found another level of trail hardness today. I also noticed that I have stopped mumbling to myself and have progressed to full voice talking and even yelling at appropriate times. This one will be one I would never put myself through again, but will never forget.
The hotel we are staying in is an old country club. It has been around for almost 100 years. I'm sure it was the place to be at some point in time. It still has charm and the people that work here are the best hosts I have seen on the trail. We got a deal on the room rate, I was given a six pack of Octoberfest, had a fridge moved into my room to keep the beer cold, and allowed us to use there machines to do laundry. The staff at Water Gap Country Club Rocks!
We are finished in New Jersey and moved on to Pennsylvania. I really liked New Jersey. The trail for the most part was smooth and we were very close to civilization most of the time. The trail runs behind neighborhoods and close to many towns. I seem to prefer this to the more remote areas. Hiking is the vehicle to tour small town America for me.

Last night Philip and I got to hang out with a couple of other hikers who were staying at the Country Club as well. We have seen them on the trail and at a bunk house over the past couple days. They are section hikers and again it was cool to share our experiences, thoughts, and frustrations. They both had knee issues and were leaving the trail after today's hike. 
Deep Thought:Every morning and afternoon I stretch to keep my knees and legs working right. One stretch is looking and reaching up arching and stretching my back. As I do this I look up at the view of the trees, clouds, and sky is so abstract, unique, and beautiful. We are constantly looking down to make sure we don't trip or stumble. We look out to see what's ahead of us. Maybe we should pause more often and look up. It may just change how we view the rest of the world. Deep huh?","

Kunkletown PA
Garage

We set out today to take on the Rocks of Pennsylvania. They are quite famous and after hiking over them for 23 miles I understand why. The rocks on the trail are no different than the ones we have dealt with in every other state but there is no break from them. Over the 23 miles today we probably had 2 miles with no rocks. We were constantly stepping over, around, or on top the uneven surface they provide. 9 hours of this activity proved to be very mentally challenging to say the least. I think we have 2 more days like this and then they start to disappear gradually.

I also hit my 900 mile mark today. I'm sure I was stepping on a rock when this happened. We are going to try to slack pack a good portion of PA so we can make more miles per day, getting me closer to seeing the family and Philip closer to being done.
We did a little over 23 miles today which sets a personal record for me for most miles in a day hiking. We slack packed today and I finished just as it started to rain . . . again. This guy (name is Catch Up) who slacked us was supposed to meet us at this road we agreed on this morning. He was not there. The rain is coming down and I have no shelter. I texted him 3 times and got no response and the rain starts to come down harder. I call him and the signal is so bad we can't hear each other. I'm getting pissed. He finally texted me and tells me he will be there soon. WHAT!!??
When he shows up I had been standing in the rain for 45 minutes. I had done my best to stay under the canopy of trees and used my jacket to (unsuccessfully) keep my entire body dry. He was very apologetic and shared that after using the woods to . . . well you know . . . poop, he lost his phone and was only able to find it because I was calling him. I was relieved to be in a dry place, felt bad for the guy, and mad as hell all at the same time. Just all part of the never ending story.
Tonight we are sleeping in the garage of the guy who is slacking us tomorrow. He's pretty excited because Grey Beard is staying here tonight as well. Grey Beard trying to be the oldest hiker to thru hike the AT at age 82. He's kind of a trail celebrity. He has about 200 miles to go and our host has a pretty severe man crush on him.","

Today started off in a thick fog and stayed cool and cloudy all day. Since the past few weeks have been warmer than normal, I have been hiking in shorts and a short sleeve windbreaker. I did the same today, but was cold every time I stopped. I did not have anything warmer to put on because my gear was back in Kunkletown. Lesson learned.
I wanted to be able to describe the rocky surface of PA and how it makes me feel. Here are a few analogies that I have come up with. Distance swimming in the ocean. Christmas Shopping in Target on 12/23. Washing grease off your hands in cold water without soap. Roller Skating on gravel. Walking across a field of bowling balls and car parts. Do you get the picture?
I'd also like to talk about snoring. What the hell?!?! How can people make so much noise and stay asleep and not even realize they are making all that noise?? I carry ear plugs because I am a light sleeper but the snore noise does not seem to be affected. That's all I have to say about that.","

We left Kunkletown this morning and I have to say that, despite sleeping on garage floor, we have been taken great care of. Our host took us to the pub for dinner both nights and they have great food and free beer! Yes I said free beer. 
We had to dial back on the miles today because of the distance between campsites. We either hiked 16 or 25 miles and we also got a late start, so opted for the 16. We are continuing our slack packing with our third driver tomorrow.
I had a couple opportunities to talk to Grey Beard and got some pretty profound wisdom. The first thing he told me is that ""My biggest enemy is the darkness."" He was referring to hiking in the dark as opposed to the daylight. I think this holds true universally as deep as you want to take it. I have found this to be true in my mind and heart out here. 
I asked him what was his biggest take away from doing the AT. He said that he had a much deeper appreciation for his family. I couldn't agree more. We hope to see him complete his hike in Harpers Ferry on 10/26.","

I had a couple of interesting perspectives hit me today. The first one was about something I noticed about myself. When I started the trail I would see the Northbounders come by or past me and because they have been hiking for months, they would just fly by me. They looked like real athletes. Today (Saturday) as I was hiking in PA there were dozens of day hikers hiking to the top of this mountain. I'm hiking by them and past them like a wild man and thought to myself I am what I saw 3 months ago. Weird and Amazing at the same time.
The second thing is how the trail has restored my faith in humanity. People actually care about other people. I know right?! We have seen people give us water, rides, food, beer, and encouragement. We actually had two people drive a couple hours one way to pick us up and help us slack pack. They didn't expect any compensation for it. They are/were hikers and just wanted to give back to what has given them so much. That is a concept I want to apply to all areas of my life and specifically toward hikers in the future.

For the 5th day in a row we have high stepped, slipped, and slopped over rocky terrain, not wet weather. It takes a toll on your feet and your brain. I think my feet are handling it better. Also for the 5th day in a row we have averaged over 20 miles per day. I'm motivated to get to Harpers Ferry and see my family. I will also get a chance to see the oldest man to ever hike the AT complete his hike the same weekend. Gray Beard is 82 years old and is going to finish on 10/26/17.
I have one more observation about yesterday with all the day hikers. When we reach a popular mountain that the local people like to hike, we get a chance to talk to them. It's always nice to have conversations with new people. It is pretty evident by our appearance that we are thru hikers and when people approach us they are really interested in what, how, when, and why we are hiking. I feel like a celebrity and many of the people express that we are doing what they dream about doing someday. This is pretty freakin' cool. I'm a professional walker. WTH!?","

Guess What? FALL HAS ARRIVED!!! A cold front came in last night and it's cool, dry, and I can't wait hike in it. This is the weather I have been waiting for for weeks. After over 100 miles in the past 5 days, I still wish I could be hiking today. 
Last week I sent my tent home and got a hammock so I could sleep better. Joy send me a picture of my youngest daughter, Olivia, sleeping and she was cuddling with that tent. This picture broke and filled my heart at the same time. In less than 2 weeks I will see my family for the 1st time in 3 months. This is what drives me to get those big miles and pushes thru the rain, heat, rocks, and the shit every day. FAMILY.
Life goes on on the trail just like in real life. We are a moving community where you cross paths, hang out, and travel with people from all walks of life. You meet a lot of great people out here and you also meet your share of people you just don't click with (just like real life). Unfortunately, we are all on the same path and we can't easily avoid those who we may like to avoid. Now, I'm not saying these people are awful, wrong, or crazy. I'm just saying we all don't get along with everyone, and handling this predicament is a little harder out here than back home. I did not think about encountering this when I was preparing for hiking the trail. Wish me luck.","

Today we left at 6:15am in the dark. We night-hiked for about an hour. Before it was daylight I hit my 1000 mile mark!! That seems like a big deal and something to be proud of and I am, but I will hit another 1000 before I'm done. The weather was perfect. 35 degrees in the morning and about 65 degrees for the high. Reminded me of hiking back home.
We also PRd (personal record) our single day distance with a 26.8 mile day. I finished my hike in 9 hours and 15 min. That's almost a 3 mph average including stops. Not too fast in the real world but very respectable for out here. I have some aches and pains in my lower right leg and back but I'm holding together pretty well.
We are staying with Trail Angel Mary tonight. She is an awesome lady who has been through a lot. She started helping hikers when she found herself without a home and ended up living in a tent in a campground on the trail when all the thru hikers were coming through. They were very nice to her and she began to help them out with water and fruit. When she got back on her feet she moved close to the AT and began helping out hikers with rides, slack packing, and a place to stay. She has also fought cancer twice and just got her left knee replaced in August. Mary Rocks!","

Sometime you have modify your plan and your goals. I would love to finish the trail and I am really enjoying and engaged in my hike. I need to figure out what the next best move is for me and my family. I am learning so much about life and myself out here and I will embrace whatever comes next.

Today is the 3 month mark since I started my hike and I did not get to hike a single mile. My shin splints did not magically disappear overnight. In fact as got up to use the bathroom through the night I felt them getting worse. 
When I got up this morning I dressed and prepared like I was going to hike. I went outside and down som stairs and knew right then that my hike was over. I thought I was ready for this but ""for no particular reason"" I want to finish. I was really enjoying the whole experience and was getting good at it. My speed, endurance and strength were all improving daily. Which is probably one of the reasons I ended up here.
I was able to go much faster and further than I ever have but neglected the wear and tear on my body. Combine that with the unstable surface of the Rocks of PA and the shins gave out. 
What's next? I'm not sure. After feeling sorry for myself all morning, with the help of Adam, Brad and Joy I decided to attack this the same way do everything else. With my training, my knees and my hike I come up with a plan and attempt to attack it from every angle. With this, rest is very important. Along with rest I'm going to ice, elevate, compress, stretch and massage multiple times a day to provide the best environment for healing.
As far as the hike is concerned, I want to finish and I'm hoping to figure out a way to do it. Because I was slack packing thru PA, I had places to stay lined up thru Sunday (10/22). My hope to take a few days off and continue heal. If I can I will start hiking with Phillip on Monday and meet the family at Harper's Ferry on Wednesday (10/26).
I need your support and prayers. This is not how I pictured things working out and I'm not sure when I will get back on the trail. But this adds another chapter to the story and another obstacle in the adventure of life. Sometimes you just have to look at your life and situation from the view of a spectator, like you're watching a movie that you are the main character in. This helps remove the emotions and helps you see things more clear.","

I'm laying on the couch elevating and icing my leg and I can't help to be reminded of my knee replacement recovery and being laid up in Bangor Maine waiting for my lost backpack to show up. Both memories were a very tough time for me and I'm really not stoked reliving either of these experiences.
My foot/leg is more swollen today than yesterday. I had a chance to meet with a PT yesterday and I do not have shin splints. I have some type of soft tissue injury or tendinitis. Rest, ice, compression and elevation are the prescription. I also got inserts for my shoes and a brace for my calf area. He also said if I return to hiking and the swelling and pain continues, I should get off the trail and take significant time off.
I'm actually torn on what to do. I really what to finish the trail but really want to get on with my life. There is so much I want to do and share from this experience. I have received so many words of encouragement from many people. Most saying how strong I am and how you know I can finish this. Maybe that's not the goal. Maybe just maybe I have completed my hike. Will not finishing the trail haunt me if I do come off? Will people look at my effort as a failure? Will stopping now effect my plans for the future? All questions I don't have the answer to.
I want to hike. The weather is perfect, the terrain has calmed down and I'm heading toward home. But I want to see my family. I want to enjoy the holidays and have taken the past 3 months thinking, planning and believing in the future. A lot of my plans revolve around the experience of hiking the AT. I want to share my experience thru speaking and writing a book. I want to help people overcome their obstacles and find their greatness. I want to give back to the trail and help people like I've been helped. 
Do I have to finish the trail now to do all these things? Do I fail if I don't hike all the trail now? Would I be teaching by example that your not reaching the goal you set is ok? Or would I be showing by example that sometimes you have to modify your goal because “Many plans are in a person’s mind, but the Lord's purpose will succeed.”? Is it about the journey or the destination? 
I don't want to go through all these trials but this is what makes the story real and when I look back on these moments, these trials are what makes the adventure more valuable and life changing. This was not my plan on finishing the trail, but I know I will finish it. I wanted to hike it straight through. Maybe there is a better way and maybe there is a best way. That's the way I want, the best way. Time will tell.","

After all the planning, preparing, training. After all the miles, obstacles and set backs. After exploring all my options, I have a plan and I'm actually excited about executing it.
Life is all about choices. Every choice or decision you make has consequences. Some good and some bad. Even if you choose to do nothing that is still a choice and there will be consequences. I believe that in life we are always being prepared for that next moment in time and that next choice. It is our job to choose the BEST next thing to do for ourselves and our families. Of course, there are always many options to choose from which makes life exciting, confusing and scary all at the same time. Here are my options at this next big moment in time:
Option 1: Rest the next 2 days and start hiking again on Monday. This ends up leaving about 65 miles in PA unhiked and a very high risk of further injuring my leg. I don't have shin splints as I thought. I saw a PT and he said this is a soft tissue and tendon issue (tendinitis). My healing progress does not leave me confident that I would be ready to hike on Monday.
Option 2: Quit the trail and restart my real life. Being gone for 3months from home is tough. I missed 3 months of growth of my kids, 3 months of connection with my wife and just missing home, family  and friends. I've got a future to build and I'm excited and ready to get started. But I can't leave this adventure unfinished without giving it all I have. I want show myself, family and those who supported me that reaching for significant goals will be tough and there will be setbacks. The story is not finished yet.
Option 3: Take time off to heal, go home and see my family. Then get back on the trail and finish what I started. The trail will have a lot less people on it as all the thru hikers will be gone. Phillip will be gone. The weather will be colder and will have to carry more gear and food to protect myself. But this is my BEST next thing to do.
Choosing option 3 will require a lot of planning and help from many people. It's seems like this solo trek of hiking the Appalachian Trail takes about 10,000 people to succeed. 
Here is my plan:
I'm going to stay with Adam (Catch Up) until Thursday 10/26. He was planning on going to Harper's Ferry to be a part of the Gray Beard celebration. Remember Gray Beard is the oldest person to finish the AT at 82 years old. I will meet my family there as planned but then I'm going to leave with them and come home!! Yay!!!!I'm going to stay home through Thanksgiving to visit, heal, recharge, train and prepare to get back on and finish the trail. Yay!!Adam is going to Hot Springs NC for Thanksgiving. This is a couple hours from home. I'm going to meet Adam in Hot Springs and ride back to PA with him.Adam will take me back to the spot on the trail that I came off of and I will continue to hike south to Springer Mt. GA. Yay!! 
I should be done by the end of January to early February. There are no guarantees that I will finish. But I can guarantee that I will have given it my BEST effort.
Thank you Joy for standing beside me through all of this. Thank you Adam for making this possible. Thank you to all who supported and encouraged me continually a long the way.","

Last night we went to Aubrey's (Adams's son) wrestling club practice. I was never a wrestler and really don't understand how it all works. I can appreciate the workout these boys went through. They worked for almost 2 hours running, sprinting, flipping, and wrestling each other. 
The age of the boys was around 7 to high school. One of the last things they did was three 3 minute rounds of jogging and sprinting. There was one little boy who was around 10 years old that caught my eye. As they were running the laps he was holding his side and crying. He had 6 more minutes and I was sure he was not going to make it. I was wrong. He kept running and crying the whole time. No one was making him do this, he just wanted to finish.
After practice was over I walked over to the boy and he was expressing to his mom his disappointment in himself. I went over to tell him way to hang in there and that he did a good job. In his mind he had failed because he thought he was the only one struggling. The reality is that he was the most impressive boy I saw tonight. Not only because he finished but he gave it his best effort. Hmmm....","

Today was a day that had been marked on the calendar in my mind for a long time. Today was the day that in was supposed to meet up with my family again. Today is also the day that Gray Beard was finishing the the trail. And today was the day I would have been officially half way through with my hike as Harper's Ferry is the ceremonial half way point on the AT. The real one is the woods somewhere and there is not much to celebrate with out there.
Well most importantly, I got to reunite with my girls!! I was very excited and nervous before they arrived. I had been in Harpers Ferry for most of the day and they did not arrive until 2:20pm. The feeling of seeing them was love, gratitude and relief. Because my trek is on pause, I was not that emotional (I did not cry). I knew I will go home with them. I guess the best way to put it is that all is right with my world and everything is back as it should be. Love!
Gray Beard did walk his last mile into Harper's Ferry complete with speeches, interviews, pictures and sparkling grape juice. He was very thankful and proud and who can blame him. Yesterday I realized he is actually older than the AT itself. I know what he went through first hand and I'm nearly half his age. At 82 years old he hiked 2189 miles continuously. Congrats my brother on your major life accomplishment.
I did not get to the half way point and there were many of my counterparts that were here today that did. So on that note, this was a bittersweet day. This is the time of year I looked forward to hiking most. The weather is cool, the leaves are changing and I was ready. Plans are made all the time but the Great One determines the steps of life. I'm looking forward to those next steps.","

This morning I got to take my family for a hike on the trail and as there always is, the trail never disappoints. Somehow it knows what you need and gives it to you. The girls were very intrigued with battle scars from the civil war, following the white blazes and seeing 5 deer just feet away from us. I will hike this piece again when I return to the trail and I’m sure it hold a special time for me then too.
We left Harper’s Ferry and drove home. It was 6-7 hour drive and we stopped at a zoo in VA called the Natural Bridge Zoo. The animals at this zoo were the most active and visible I have ever seen. We had a great time. When we walked in a cougar (the animal kind) growled and hissed at us. There was a bird exhibit that you actually walked into and they landed on you. The big ticket animals (tigers, bears, an elephant, a python and giraffes) all were out and moving around and doing what you would think they should be doing. I got spit on by a lama, fed a giraffe but no monkeys threw there poop at me. So yeah, it was a good zoo experience.
When I go home I went to my brewery for one beer and got to see a lot of friends and people from my little slice of the world. It was cool to see everyone but surreal as well. There was some culture shock. I have either been in the woods around the same 5-10 people or in town where i knew no one. It was almost a sensory overload to walk in a tavern where everyone know you and knows where you have been. I miss my world, but I wasn’t quite prepared to step back into it.","

I live in a pretty small town. Not as small as the towns along the trail but small enough that when I go out, I will see people I know. I noticed that a lot of people around here have been following my journey, which is awesome. Friends from the gym, moms from school, guys from church, and fellow beer drinkers from the tap room. It is very cool to have so much support from family, friends, acquaintances and people I don't even know. Keep it up, it makes a huge difference.
Football Watching 
I got to sit in my chair, in my living room, drink beer, eat snacks and watch football on my tv. This may sound very self centered, but man I sure did enjoy it! Go Bills!!
Pumpkin Carving
I managed to talk the family into one family pumpkin for Halloween this year. If you are the pumpkin carver in your house you know what a relief this was. I was glad to be here and be able to keep the pumpkin carving tradition in tact.
I Can't Stop Eating
Even though my walking has gone from 20 plus miles per day to around 2 miles per day, my mind/body still thinks I'm hiking. I could eat all the time. This may become a problem, but for now I'm glad to be a able to put on a few pounds. When people see me, their first words are usually ""Wow, you are little!"" Just for the record, no guy ever wants to hear those words, ever.
Rehab and Dad Arms
So I did what most men would do, headed back to the gym. Joy and I decided to workout together while I'm home. We drop the kids off at school and head straight to the gym to get ""swole"". I could get used to this.
Happy Halloween 
Being home, I will get to be a part of several holiday activities starting with Halloween. I got paint Olivia's (my 7 year old) face as a zombie bride. Mia (my 10 year old) was a peppermint. I guess you can say they have different personalities.
Cold and Alone
At least it's not Naked and Afraid. I have been prepping for my return to the trail. It will be considerably colder and I will probably have less company out there. I made a few upgrades to gear and I think I will be up for the challenge. Down booties to keep my feet warm, waterproof stuff sacks to ensure my gear stays dry, compression socks to keep my legs healthy and more memory for my phone for more music, photos, videos, podcasts and books for my entertainment and sanity.
Preparing For The Future
I have also been preparing for life after the AT. This week I have started a patent process on couple of ideas I have had on the trail. I have secured a co-author for the book I'm going to write. I have worked through a program called ""Something to Say"" and attended a Toastmaster meeting to build public speaking skills. Big things on the horizon!
Naps and TV
And on the other end of the spectrum, I have been relaxing. Partly because of my leg and partly because it feels good. Catching up on all the shows Joy and I love to watch and taking a cat nap have become part of my new daily routine.
My Own Bed!!
Over the past 3 months I slept in/on almost 100 different places. From motel beds, garage floors, tents, bunks, shelters, hostels, couches and next to a park bathroom. Needless to say, sleep has been tough to find and maintain. My bed with my wife on the other hand, has been pure heaven! That's all I have to say about that.
World Series
In honor of my hiking partner Phillip I watched games 6 & 7 of the World Series. Phillip is from the Houston area and I was happy to see the Astros earn the title, World Series Champs!
Foot/Leg Progress
My tendinitis is getting better everyday. The progress is slow but I'm pretty sure I will be good to go on 11/25. There is no more swelling and the pain when I point my toe is minimal. I can still feel the knot outside my shin and some stretching movements reveal that I'm not quite there yet.
Until next week.

Magic Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580502,"On the 2nd week of my break from the AT I have gotten used to being at home. Driving to get somewhere, sleeping inside, drinking coffee every morning, a beer or two every night, and being around my family and friends will make going back on the trail a little mentally tough but there is a part of me that is ready to get out there and see if I can finish. To my thru hiker counterparts, keep digging. I know this rain and cold has sucked lately but you are getting closer. Smell that finish line!


On the Mend and Back in the Saddle:
My foot/leg is getting better there is no pain when I walk or even workout. I went for a short test hike at a near by mountain this week and although it was not the distance or steepness I will be facing, everything seemed to hold up nicely. My plan is on schedule. 


Hey Grandpa!
I went to school to have lunch with my 2nd grader this week. We had a great time eating popcorn chicken, corn, and salad. All the little ones love it when big people come to visit.  One of Olivia's little friends even asked me if I was Olivia's dad or grandpa. Damn!


Save Our School!
My wife asked me to go to a school board meeting this week to give our opinion on shutting down our elementary school that was built over 60 years ago. The plan is to move our kids to the next town over. I know right. I even used a thru hiker experience to express my point.


Reconnecting with Friends:
I have had a chance to sit down and hang out with some pretty cool people, my people (lunch, dinner, a beer or a game) these past couple weeks. My friends mean a lot to me. This has been a special part of coming home. It is awesome to be though about and loved.


Something to Say!
For the 2nd week in row, I went to a Toastmasters meeting. This is a club/organization that focuses on public speaking and leadership training. This is a big part of the Switalski master plan for the future.


4 birds with 1 stone :
I packed up my hammock and my daughter and headed to the gym this Sunday. Bird #1: I got a rowing workout in. Bird #2: I set up my hammock and figured out how to keep pertinent gear from freezing. Bird #3: I got some cool dad points for allowing Olivia to play Minecraft and drink soda in my hammock. Bird #4 (most important): I gave my wife a little break from mom duty.Until next week....","

Magic Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580740,"With my departure back to the AT less than a week away, there are definitely some mixed feelings. There would be something wrong with me if a part of me did not want to go back out in the beginning of winter. It's going to be colder than a hiker's balls in brass underwear. I also have really enjoyed my time with my family and friends. I have been able spend more time with Joy, Mia, and Olivia, as well as see my buddies who have been supporting me through this whole adventure. Call me crazy, but life is pretty good from where I'm standing.
I Got This
I also want to go. I am up for the challenge of the colder weather and less populated trail. I actually like when days are short and the nights are cold. I love the snow and really want to finish the trail. I would love to be able to do both but my heart knows what I need to do. Leaving something undone without giving it my best just isn't me and isn't real effective for what I'm trying to teach and live.
One Step At A Time

My leg is about 90% healed and I don't see it being an issue as long as I'm not an idiot and pay attention to my body. I have gone on a couple of test hikes and on the last one I felt no pain at all. I have sought the council of a PT and a qualified friend, and have been given my ""marching orders"". I'm Rrrreeaady!
Mr. Mom

I have been enjoying just being a husband and daddy while I'm home. In fact, there is a new appreciation for being a part of my family. Joy and I take the girls to school and then head to the gym together. I got to take the girls to their swim practice, church activities, and shopping for Joy's Christmas gifts.
Just Good Beer

So This Is Christmas

Being home during this time I have had the chance to experience some holiday festivities. This week was the annual Lighting of my towns Christmas Tree, complete with a fireworks display. The following day is the Concord Christmas Parade. My family has attended these events for years now and although crowds and low budget floats are not my favorite things, I was so thankful to get to be here at this time. Thanks Big Man!!
Thanks!!

I'm somewhat surprised of the amount of people who have been following my journey and actually want to hear my story. This is good thing since this is how I plan to live my life when I return home. I am excited about what the future holds and hopefully many of you will be as well. Happy Thanksgiving!!","

Mile 1054 (11miles)
Darlington Shelter 
Hammock 
Well folks I'm back on the trail. Started back where I left off about 5 weeks ago in Duncannon PA. I wish I could tell you I was excited or I had a great day. I should be excited and I should've had a great day. I'm out here getting to do something I love. The day was absolutely perfect (sunny and 45 degrees). I am prepared and even though I lost some physical conditioning, I only hiked 11 miles and the terrain was not too bad. I should be feeling pretty good right about now, but I don't.
When I started this journey I set out to always shoot you straight. I want this hike to be authentic and inspiring. I wish I could explain how confused I feel. All that I know right now is that I feel like I'm not in the right spot. I do not doubt my physical capability or my mental strength. I am not scared of the trail that lies ahead. I'm as prepared as I could possibly be to finish the AT. 
I want to be an example of setting and reaching a goal. I know there has to be a struggle if I want to achieve greatness. I want to use this journey as platform to help, inspire, and influence people. Part of me thinks that if I decide my hike is over I have failed at what I set out to do. The other part of me says you have accomplished what you set out to do and just because a group of people determined the length of the Appalachian Trail doesn't mean that had to be length of my hike.
This adventure was never a test of my endurance, a bucket list item or midlife crisis. I wanted to achieve greatness, teach my girls that anything is possible and figure out what the next chapter of Switalski family is going to look like. 
It looks like this is going to be a lesson in how to make important decisions. Life is not easy and I don't really want it to be. I wish someone could tell which way was the best way. I would do it! Unfortunately, this is my decision to make alone.","Duncannon PA

Mile 1069 (15miles)
Hostel
Bunk
I slept great last night and stayed warm in below freezing temps. The weather is perfect for hiking, sunny and cool. My hike today was also set up to be perfect. I had one mountain to descend and then flat to slight rolling hills through pastures and farms of the Cumberland Valley. Too bad I don't want to be here. 
Why do I not want to be here? Is this different than last time I started? What am supposed to do?
Here is what I do know:
I'm disciplined I'm not a quitter I love backpacking I love fall/winter I've already hiked 1069 miles
I spent my whole day trying to figure this thing out. Then it came to me (well it came to me through a pod cast). My life or my hike is not determined by 2189 miles. I came out for several reasons and had achieved all them before I left because of my injury. We tend toward getting all wrapped up in this country with grades, medals, destinations, accomplishments and not paying enough attention to why we learn, win and compete. I'm very goal oriented and I am normally totally focused on reaching my destination. My character would be to gut this hike out so I could finish.","

Magic Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580842,"It would be safe to say that those who know me may agree that I'm disciplined, structured, systematic, as well as sarcastic, grumpy, sentimental and bunch of other stuff that does not pertain directly to this story.
Here is the conversation that has constantly gone in my head  for the past 5 weeks. 
Disclaimer this may get a little messy....
5 weeks ago:
Mind: You know we are going back right?
Body: Wait, what did you say?
Emotion: But we just got home. It feels so good to be here. Everyone loves us here.
Body: You know I'm pretty busted up, right?
Mind; Yes I know. We will take some time to recover, recharge and visit. I have a plan. We will be just fine. Now leave me alone I have lots of planning to do.
Heart: What are you searching for?
Mind: We learned and figured out so much on the first half of the trail. There has got to be more in the second half. We need to get a better future, get more ideas.
Fast Forward 5 weeks:
Mind: Alright guys I have been researching, planning, testing and preparing for our trip.
Body: I'm healed up but don't know how long it will last.
Emotion: it sure feels good to be at home! I have had a fantastic time. Do we have to leave?
Heart: Why are we doing this?
Mind: We set a goal and we have to reach it. It's what we do. You guys have been there before you know what to do. Suck it up. You have to go through the suck to reap the reward. We will adapt and overcome. We always do.
The Day:
Body: Man, its cold and windy out here.
Emotion: I'm really not feeling it. Usually I'm excited or at least anxious. I don't want to be here.
Mind: These are the days we have been waiting for. The air is cool, no bugs and the views are more visible with all the leaves gone. We are in good shape to hike and we will only get stronger. We have all the right gear and I have planned this trip out to a tee. You guys will feel better in a few days.
Heart: Something's not right.
Day 2
Body: Damn, its cold out there. We better warm up before we hike.
Emotion: Is it going to be this cold all the time? What happens when it rains? I'm scared and want to go home.
Mind: Relax guys, I got us covered. We have to finish this. We want to inspire people and teach them how to reach their goals and achieve their greatness. How will it look if we quit?
Body and Emotion: You're the boss.
Heart: What did they say?
Later that day
Body: Man, I'm tired. This sucks!
Emotions: I know I should be loving this right now but I'm not. His music is not even effecting me.
Mind: They maybe right. We should be loving this. The weather is perfect, the trail is easy, the views are beautiful. We have time to think and plan. We can eat whatever we want and we don't have to deal with bills, traffic or reality.  Something's not right. What should we do?
Body: I don't know but I'm hungry.
Emotion: I feel so confused.
Mind: Maybe we should seek some council. 
Heart: What is the next best thing to do for Jeff and the family?
Mind: I'm not sure. What do you think?
Heart: The trail has given us everything we needed, asked for and more. Just because the length of the trail is 2189 miles doesn't determine our hike. We are not bound to man made boundaries, protocols, certifications, degrees or awards. Life is about learning, applying, teaching and caring. Our work on trail is complete. It's time to take what we gained and go be a better husband, dad, friend, business partner, author, speaker, inventor and man. 
Body: I'm in. This sucks! Not sure I would have made it anyways.
Emotion: Me too! I can't wait get back home! But I'm kind of ashamed. It looks like we failed.
Mind: What are people going to think (say)??
Heart: We may come  back to the trail someday. In fact I would bet on it. But we will return because we want to not because we think it defines us or our success. We walk in the spirit of truth not in the letter of the law. Not everyone will agree or understand and that's ok. We will always seek what is best not the approval of others.
Mind: What is she going say?
Body: She's pretty and she's strong!
Emotion: I Love her!!
Heart: Me too.","
