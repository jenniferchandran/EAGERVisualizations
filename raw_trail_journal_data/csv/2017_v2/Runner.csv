Runner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566894,"I finished packing my pack. I packed and prepared as if I will be gone until September. I will walk until I'm satisfied, but I prepared as if I'm going to Maine. So home maintenance, bills, and chores should not enter into equation of when enough is enough. I did my standard 7 mile walk with my pack yesterday and again today. It makes my back sore and I had to stop and rest it a couple of times each day. I do not stop to rest when I do the same walk without my pack.  I hope it improves with time. It has to!  I have broken vertebrae in my back multiple times in the past, and it can be temperamental, but it carried me through a thru hike in 2012 and I hope it will come around this time.  Only time and walking with that pack will tell.",,View Entry,"May 31, Wed",0
Runner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567334,"I'm all packed up and ready to go. Spent 12 hours yesterday supporting My wife's yard sale and pressure washing the parsonage. BUT.....Went to the music festival and fireworks last night. While leaving in the dark, My wife stepped in a hole and fell. She couldn't walk on her foot. Medics took her to hospital.  She has small fracture. Leg is in a funky cast and she is not allowed to walk on it. She is using a walker to get around. SO.....I my walk is sidelined before I get started.",,View Entry,"Jun 04, Sun",0
