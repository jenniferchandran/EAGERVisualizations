Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574932,"Somehow forgot to buy my water bottles in Bangor, didn't realize until I was leaving the ranger station. Oh well, up the Hunt trail we go. Spectacularly beautiful the whole way up. Drank from the stream on my way up, feels wonderful to dunk your face in that cold clear water and drink your full. When I got above the tree line boulder with weathered bowl shaped depressions held rain water from the night before. From the tableland up was covered in clouds, no long distance views but it felt better, as if I was being given the chance to focus just on the mountain and she is breathtaking! From the peak I headed across the knife edge trail to pamola peak. The weather started to deteriorate, the wind picked up, gusting up 50mph. It was exhilarating, pure joy, I don't when I've felt more alive. I just don't know how to describe it, one the greatest experiences of my life. Back across the knife edge and I started making my way down Hunt. Found a half full water bottle just below the tableland, damn litters but hooray good fortune. When I got back down to the campground some car campers were leaving so I asked for and received a water bottle from them, score! Feeling much better about my water situation for the 100 mile wilderness! Slept this night in leant too #5 beside the stream, fantastic spot!","Katahdin stream campground

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574938,"Up before the sun, I'm too excited to sleep anymore I'm ready to go! Just waiting on enough light to see. Headed down the trail by 5am. Lots of moose poop along the way, lots, turns out they love our trails too. Beautiful walk with no climbing, most of the day along side a stream with several pretty falls. Saw a sandy beach on the opposite side so I crossed for a break in the sun. Pretty sketchy getting across, water was only knee deep but a little stronger than I was expecting and the rock was super slick. No mishaps, great break laying on the sand just below some falls. Made it out the park and to abol bridge in good time and decided to walk till I felt tired. Set up camp near rainbow lake campsites, watched a sunset throw pretty colors on the lake. Good day","Katahdin stream campground

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574941,"Knees were super stiff this morning. Painful hobbling around to break camp lol. Perhaps I did push a little hard yesterday. Knees wouldn't loosen up all day so I call it quits early afternoon on top of mt nesuntabunt. Great spot all to myself with a perfect east facing view of Katahdin for sunrise tomorrow. Hopefully knees are back in line tomorrow, I had to talk rough to them","Rainbow lake campsites

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574962,"Incredible sunrise this morning! Watched the whole show, so thankful I'm here to see this. On trail and moving by 5:45, knees are stiff but I can feel them loosening up. 3 miles or so and I stopped for breakfast on a sandy beach of some lake. A pair of loons were swimming along not too far out, seems they make a variety of sounds including one that's sound a lot like a whiperwool (spelling?). Good pace and mileage today, 20 something. I think the real reason so many claim its hard to make miles in Maine is the blueberries, they are everywhere right now! I have to stay on top of myself to not stop and snack (gorge myself) on them every few hundred yards lol. I am kind of enjoying walking on top of the roots and rocks, reminds me of being a kid and playing and running around in the woods. Maybe being a kid in Maine gives me a bit of an advantage as it seems intuitive to me, the general opinion from other hikers on roots and rocks is negative lol. The woods are beautiful beyond my limited vocabulary. Camped near the Cooper brook leann too, there is a waterfall nearby which makes a perfect sound to fall asleep to. Another great day!","Top of nesuntabunt mt

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574966,"Camped near another lean too, there's usually a water source near the lean toos which is nice for dinner and having water to start the next day. Up and on the trail shortly after 5am, walked past the main tenting area of the shelter, seems they're all still asleep. I like starting early, gives me a few hrs before I see anyone else on the trail and I don't feel pressured later in the day to make miles. I stop often all over the place, to stop and take in some beauty, to eat blueberries, to just sit and listen. Near the end of my day I passed a Nobo who informed me there is some kind of trail magic going on about 3miles ahead of me. Hamburgers, hotdogs and sodas are being served to thru-hikers! Instantly my brain and stomach get together and demand a soda! Sugar craving I guess? It's later in the afternoon and I begin to worry it'll be gone by the time I get down there so I start jogging the downhill lol. Not as easy as it sounds, moist roots and rocks are slicker than greased owl poop! Made it! Guy has a cabin in the woods with a generator and well plus a view to envy. Super generous, nice people, said help yourself to the sodas, I'll have you a cheeseburger and hotdog shortly! I drank 3 sodas in quick succession lol. Hung my hammock on the outskirts of his clearing. Oh yeah, he has this dog who has his own, uh ""love pillow"". Dog would carry it over near a hiker, wedge it against the hiker or pack and go to town! Lol funniest part was the uncomfortable looks from the hiker! Great day! ","Carl newhall memeorial lean too

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575088,"Up and moving early. I forgot to turn my phone off last night so my last battery died doh. No worries I'm only about 14 miles from the southern end of the 100 and the town of Monson. I'm in a bit of a rush to get to town to make sure I have time to resupply, shower and do some laundry but it's a beautiful walk and I'm sad to be leaving the 100. When can I ever make it back here? I hope this is not the last time I'm ever here, even if it is I feel incredibly lucky to have been here and experienced this special place. Thank you people of Maine for having the foresight and fortitude to preserve all of these natural places. When I finally make it to the road into Monson there is no one around, my battery is dead so I can't call for a ride, I know there is another sobo behind me somewhere and he has arranged for a pick-up but I don't know how far behind he is so I start walking. The highway is a loud super unpleasant place after a week in the woods. No luck hitchhiking for the first 3 miles then a driver from the hostel stops and picks me up yay! Within a half hour I'm showered, laundry has been started and I'm in the gas station for some food. First whoopie pie in years, nirvana, plus they're 800 calories per! I buy a whoopie pie, a half gallon of chocolate milk and order a large pizza, whoopie pie and chocolate milk are finished before my pie is done cooking lol. Yes, I ate my large pizza after that, considerably slower. My dad is coming to pick me up tomorrow, my grandfather's sister, Shirley is having an 80th birthday party in Bangor. I'll get to my uncle Chris and possibly other family I haven't seen in a long time, I'm excited! ","Somewhere in the woods

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575093,"I got my days mixed so rather than go back and change the dates I'll correct it here. Dad picked me up this morning, we retrieved Carolyn, Anna and Caliegh from their hotel and had breakfast before heading to uncle Chris's house. Birthday party for my granfathers sister Shirley, I can see him in her face and I'm a little sad. I wish I had straightened out before he passed, he loved so much and I was such an asshole. Uncle Charles, aunt Debbie, Stephanie, Kyle his wife and two handsome sons were there. Some Newfoundlander Mullins were there as well. Uncle Chris has a great family now with two strapping sons of his own! Great great visit just being around these people, loved hearing my uncles and dad just talking everday talk, them ribbing each other, felt like when I was little. Had dinner with Dad Carolyn, Anna and Caliegh and talked a little with my sisters, made me laugh a little to learn of some of the similarities we share. Really great day!! Back on the trail tomorrow morning and I'm excited! Ok journal is all caught up, I'll try and add entries more frequently from here on out.","Monson

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575247,"Got a late start leaving the Monson, was waiting for another couple hikers to be ready so the shuttle driver wouldn't be making a trip for just me. Hit the trail at 11am, easy walking. Stopped for lunch about 1, right after I started walking again I came across free sodas near a road crossing. I felt on top of the world, a full belly, an ice cold root beer, I put my earbuds in and made fantastic time! Lol I couldn't stop chuckling to myself, ice cold root beer in the woods, it seemed very incongruous at the time. I was trying to set myself up for a shorter day into Caratunk tomorrow so I was pushing hard over the easy terrain but this meant a climb at the end of my day, up and over Moxie Bald mountain(haha love that one). Hit the summit in time for a beautiful sunset, paused long enough for some pictures and to get my fleece on as well as getting my headlight accessible then I started down. Walked for a while before I needed my light. I was worried about my footing while night hiking but no problems and I made the few miles down to the lean too fairly quickly. Found a spot to hang my hammock and got set up, ate a quick cold dinner, hung my food and was asleep as soon as lay down. Good day, very pleased with myself, no complaining from the knees.","Monson

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575255,"Slept in a little bit today, stupid this is the difference later on, hit the trail at 6:30. I have  7.5 hrs to do about 15miles with only one small but 5 mile long elevation gain, pick up my new shoes in Caratunk and be on time for the last ferry across the Kennebec. Doable, except my feet start the day swollen instead of working their way to it so I move somewhat gingerly for a mile or so. Then the blueberries, great big ones first big ones I've found, I've not eaten breakfast yet so resistance is futile. Later I find that the rubber O ring in my water filter has abandoned ship, I feel worse about littering than the useless filter lol. I'll keep drinking clear cold springs and brooks and be happy for it. Over the top of Pleasant Pond Mountain and now I can jog the down hills! I love this! Some sketchy looking water sources and looking for better ones slow me down a little bit it's hot today and I need water more often. From the bottom it's pretty easy walking to Caratunk. I walked up to the Caratunk House, where I had my shoes mailed to, at 1:50. Sleeping in, what a dumbass. Next ferry is 9am tomorrow, oh well was still a real good day. Oh yeah new shoes with a wide toe box are heaven so far, we'll see how they are on the trail.","Near Bald Mountain Brook lean too

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576894,"Still hiking. I'll try to catch you up I guess. I'm currently at my dads house in New Hampshire taking 3 days off. I'm through the whites and just about 6 trail miles from the Vermont boarder. New Hampshire was every bit as spectacular as you've heard, it was also pretty challenging! Went up and over the presidential range smiling and laughing like a lunatic! How lucky am I?!! Was frequently repeated. Just before I entered the whites it had started to get pretty chilly and I was wearing all my layers to bed. I stopped into pinkham notch the evening before I started my climb up mt Madison. Checked the hiker box(box where hikers abandon no longer needed gear or things they just don't want to carry) and right on time I found a pair of thick purple tights! Quite flattering and warm! As for the mountains, well you'll just have to hike them yourself, nothing I say could properly describe them. Tonic for my soul though, pure joy ! Experienced sunset from the side of mt Washington and nearly cried sitting there by myself. So so lucky. Forgot to pick up ibuprofen during my resupply in North Woodstock and was back at Franconia notch before I remembered. Not good. I went into the visitor center gift shop hoping to find some kind of pain relief and expecting to be gouged($3.50 soda kind of place). I asked the cashier if she had anything and she pulled out a single dose pack of Tylenol. ""How much?"" $.75. ""Welp gotta have em"". She asks ""are you a thru hiker?"" My smell and filthy appearance gave it away I think lol. ""Yep."" ""Here take it."" ""No, I'll pay. I'm going to need several."" She turns around and scoops out a giant handful of them and presses them into my hand with a big warm genuine smile!!! Then she fist bumps me and says good luck! I fu<#!& floated down the trail for miles grinning over this small act of kindness and generosity exactly when I need it! Perhaps people are not awful. I'll try and continue to catch you up later.","Dad's house

Aristocat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578774,"I am in New Jersey right now, mile 891, I'll enter Pennsylvania tomorrow morning and cross mile 900 a little later. Lol 900 miles, seems crazy to me!
I spent 3 days with Dad, Carolyn and my 2 youngest sisters at their home in New Hampshire, subsequently missing the heaviest rain to hit my vicinity on the trail! Great great visit! Got to get to know my dad as an adult a little bit, had a wonderful evening sitting around a fire with Carolyn and my sisters talking and listening to them, had the chocolatiest chocolate cake I might have ever had! Carolyn brought trays of whoopie pies! I was sad to leave but excited to get walking again. 
Vermont lived up to its nickname Vermud. Berries were rippening and I came across several apple trees, delicious!! Figuring out my food consumption and alottment was still hard for me and I ran out near the end of Vermont, I had my emergency food but still a long way to go to pick up the box Jessica&Tyler sent me. At a trailhead parking lot I got to talking with a man who was there waiting on his wife, turns out I was at the same shelter as her the night before, unprompted he asked if I needed anything. I almost cried. He gave me enough snacks and stuff to get through that day! Put in a big day that day and woke the next morning knowing what needed to happen, 40+miles to pick the food box my sister sent. Poop or get off the pot right? It's not supposed to be easy. When I finally got my box I plopped down on the sidewalk, ripped open the box and chowed down! Some of the best tasting food I've ever eaten lol.
Massachusetts. I got 2 nearos thanks to a incredibly generous and kind trail angel. It took 2 showers to scrub 7 days of Vermud off of me. Mt Greylock was pretty nice, the monument on the top was really cool. Pretty easy walking through Mass.
Connecticut had sections that reminded me of Maine, steep, rocky and straight up but the climbs and state were over quickly.
New York started with a heatwave, upper 80's might have got to 90 one day. Quite rocky and hard not to get a little down hiking all day soaked in sweat. Plus nearly every spring/stream or brook listed in my guide book was dry or just a tiny stagnant puddle. I don't know what I would have done if it wasn't for trail angels leaving water at road crossings. Still had one night that I arrived at a shelter 13 miles after my last drink of water to find the ""reliable"" spring was a spot of nearly dried mud. That was the first time since I started that I seriously wondered if I might be in trouble. Luckily 5-6 miles later in the morning, the first road crossing I came to someone had set out a bunch of water jugs. The struggle for water continued across New York, I picked up a couple extra bottles and filled them all every time I found water. Heat continued as well. On the positive side. Crossing the bear mountain bridge was really cool, there is a sign warning hikers that peregrin falcons have been know to dive bomb them lol. Took a quick detour to walk through the fort Montgomery historical site, pretty interesting. From there the trail leads through a zoo, one of the sadder zoos I've seen. All the animals looked miserable but that could have been the heat. Bear mountain is another drive up mountain and I seem to have a knack for arriving to these on weekends. Packed, with new yorkers, awful. On the positive I was able to do 3mph up it and got away from there as fast as I could. Lol almost forgot, some guy on a bicycle stopped and asked if I was hiking the A.T., I sure am, wait till you get to the whites and have to hike some real mountains he says, I literally lol already been through em man easy peasy good day to you! Did a short day and stopped at Jim Murray's farm for some rest and to enjoy the place, plus it was supposed to cool down the next day. Its known as the secret shelter but everybody knows about it. This guy built a cabin 20 some years ago and lets hikers use it. It sits on the side of a hill on a beautiful farm, soft green grass everywhere, shade trees, cold well water an outdoor shower that sometimes produces warm water and 2 adorable nuisance donkeys. They know what a hikers food bag looks like, turned my back once and when I looked back one was picking up my bag lol. Great rest day!","New Jersey
