Sure Foot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554880,"Around the first of January I began hiking 5 or 6 times per week with about 30 lbs in my back pack. The average distance each day was 10 to 12 miles. My peak distance for 1 week was a little over 70 miles. I did nearly all my hiking in the Baytown Nature Center. Great place to visit,there are many different kinds of wild life that call it home. They include: many different kinds of birds, fish, snakes, rabbits, coyotes, and alligators. It's a nice quiet place to hike, very little car traffic on the roads and more than half of my hikes were on trails. The only drawback is that the nature center is flat. I also made 3 trips to West Texas to back pack this past year. I learned a great deal about the whole backpacking experience on these trips.","

We ended up hiking all the way to Hawk Mountain campsite which is about seven and a half miles up the Appalachian Trail from Springer Mountain. The first day was quite exciting lots of big Hills to climb and a lot of getting used to being on the trail. Because it was a weekend there were lots of other people on the trail not so many thru-hikers but a lot of day hikers. That is why we wound up going all the way to Hawk Mountain. this was the first available open Campground.," Amicalola Falls lodge

My tent almost blew away because I hadn't gotten it fully staked down when the wind hit! Tt blew 50 to 60 miles an hour and lightning was hitting all over. Very good that we got here when we did!

We did do a 18.51 miles and we climbed 4770 feet. We are also right on my schedule. We've also made friends with a couple people on the trail - we met Rooster and Hydrator. I'm not sure how Rooster got his name but Hydrator drinks about 6 liters of water a day. We also met Pacer and Monkey - Pacer got his name because he sets the pace for the two. These guys are brothers and Monkey got his name because he's a tree trimmer by trade. Terry has also hung a trail name on me, he's calling me Sure Foot now because of how slow I am when I come down steep windy and very wet mountain trails.

The terrain was very tough starting in the morning had a number of very steep knobs to climb. Late in the afternoon around mile eighteen I encountered a really big mountain called Bald Mountain. Bald Mountain tops out at 5500 feet. Getting to the top record climbing nearly 2,000 feet when I was already tired. Getting to the top of the bald was quite difficult there was a number of boulders to scramble over and the last hundred feet was nearly vertical. When I arrived on top of the bald, the wind was blowing probably 40 miles an hour I was having trouble standing up and the wind was blowing my pack sideways. The top of the bald was quite pretty it was very large it was over a mile to walk across it. I finally arrived with the Bald Mountain shelter which is several hundred feet below the summit and thankfully out of a lot of the wind. The other campers suggested that I not set up my tent and stay in the shelter with them because there was severe weather coming during the night. I thought this was a good suggestion. We did have severe weather starting around midnight, very high wind, hail and lightning striking fairly close to the shelter.

I took a picture of a tree I saw in a spruce forest on the very top of the mountain. somebody had decorated it like a a spruce tree like a Christmas tree.

This practice sped up travel when large amounts of material or maybe an army was traveling in the back country (ref. historical marker photo).

Carl says the biggest one he's made was a 30 egg omelet.  If Carl makes you an omelet you gotta eat it, no wasting food is allowed.  Carl said the guy ate the 30 egg omelet but then sat in one of Carl's chairs all afternoon.  Carl said he looked a little green too.  He said when he got ready to leave he coaxed the omelet eater to his truck and took him to a Hostel so he could sleep off the affects.  Carl says the guy stayed at the hostel an additional day and was very close to the privy all day.  I think that's probably the last 30 egg omelet someone orders from Carl.

Oh we did see a marker on a field this morning that commerates the end of the Shays rebellion in 1787.  Apparently the last battle occurred where the marker had been erected.  The Shays rebellion was led by revolutionary war veteran Daniel Shays.  He had 4000 supporters that wanted to overthrow a corrupt Massachusetts state government.  The rebellion failed, Shays was eventually pardoned after hiding out in New Hampshire for a couple of years.  You can read more in Wikipedia if you are interested in the details.","

I came around a curve and there he was in front of me going the same direction maybe 50 feet away.  I stopped and pulled out my cell phone to get a picture.  The bear stopped then saw me and ran into the brush.   No bear picture this time.  Picture is of the deer that I saw yesterday.","

The Mountain Cabin is a really great place to stay.  The owners are really nice, they do laundry and shuttle to town.  They charge 25 dollars per night for a bed, 3 dollars for laundry and no charge for one shuttle to town.  They also fix breakfast no additional charge.  I highly recommend them.
I also ate at a really good restaurant in Front Royal.  It's called the blue wing frog, if you're in town check it out, I highly recommend it.","

I left the hostel about 730 this morning, it was 35 deg and the wind was howling, gusting above 50 mph in the baskets much higher on the ridges.  I spent some extra time today clearing a path thru a lot of downed trees, limbs and etc.  Most of the fall foliage is gone, blown off.  Up high on the ridge lines, there was snow and ice.  It actually reminded me of last March in the Smokies.  Not nearly as cold or icy though.  All the ice and snow should be gone tomorrow, temps should be back in the 40s.
I have been hiking in the Shenandoah national Park most of the day.  Man I like this place, no fee to thru hike, I can stealth camp and the trails are in awesome shape. It's not easy hiking though, lots of long hard climbs and steep descents.  I also stopped at a wayside store this evening and had a great burger and fries.  They really hit the spot!
On a negative side, yesterday my feet were soaked because my worn out boots are leaking and it rained all day.  Today I got melting snow on my boots, wet Cold feet all day, I hope it's dry tomorrow.

Wow great day hiking, good terrain and nice weather.  I stopped at the Big Meadows Wayside and had a cheese burger and chili cheese fries.  That's what I call a good late breakfast.  I was also able to pick up a few food items I needed. I got a lot of attention at the wayside when people learned I was a thru hiker with 2000 miles completed. I stayed longer than I'd intended answering folks questions about my hike. I also got interviewed by a Brazilian news crew doing a special on national parks in the US.  They had heard of the Appalachian trail but didn't know how long it is or that people thru hike it.  They invited me to come hiking in Brazil. I'm going to wait a bit on that one.

I'm camping tonight in between two small brooks that feed into Ivy Creek which is quite a large creek.  Very pleasant here I can hear the water gurgling as it runs over the rocks.  This morning I had trouble finding my food bag in the dark.  I eventually found it but it took about 20 min, so much for an early start.  I had to go some distance from my campsite to find a tree with a suitable limb for hanging the bag.  Tonight, I found A great limb about 80 feet away right next to the AT.  It'll be very easy to find.  Two more days of hiking before Waynesboro, it's about 30 miles away.  I'll do another 20 miles tomorrow and finish up early on Saturday.","

This was a much longer day mileage wise than what shows up here.  I needed to resupply at a wayside store this morning.  Turned out that I should have taken an earlier trail, I ended up booking an extra 2.5 miles so I really did 22.5 today.  I had to hike some extra this afternoon to get out of an area where bears were very active, camping was not allowed in this 5 mile section.  I did see a huge bear in this area.  He crossed the trail in front of me.  BIG BEAR!I'm glad the bears know not to cross the road at Turk's Gap.    I guess they can read the sign like I did.
I spoke with two park rangers about noon, really glad I had my back country permit on my pack.  They checked it out and were pleased I'd filled it out properly.  They warned me about the active bear zone.  Nice folks.

Wow really bad day hiking made harder by terrible hiking weather.  First, I had a 3000 foot climb over the Priest mountain.  Second, it rained most of the night, air temp about 35 deg.  When I started climbing, the trees were dropping rain from their leaves.  Once I'd climbed 1500 feet, I was getting pelted with ice.  The last 500 feet there was so much ice on the ground that I was losing half of each step to slippage.  I eventually made it over the top.  Very cold and windy up there!

I hiked about 19 miles to complete the hike.  There aren't any easy days on the AT, this one was no exception.  Several really steep, hard climbs and descents and lots of rocky leaf covered trail. One thing I've learned on the AT is that you can't complete a thru hike by yourself. Literally, a thousand people helped me do this.  The many trail angels that gave me food and drinks at road crossings. There were others that drove me to towns or to the trail head from towns many times.  There's Adam Dawson drove me over half of Pennsylvania when I was slack packing. He wouldn't take any money for all this, I did buy him dinner once or twice and maybe gas once.  Just a super guy. Way back when I'd just began my hike I left my wallet in a shelter, the two guys  who found it and safe guarded it and got it back to me.
I can't thank all of you enough for all you did for me.
In short, the biggest thing that hiking the Appalachian trail had done is it's restored my faith in humanity.  There's a world of wonderful people out there!","
