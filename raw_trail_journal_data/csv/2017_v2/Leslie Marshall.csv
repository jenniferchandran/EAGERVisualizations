Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555927,"The day is getting closer. Friday we leave for VA where we will visit our dear friends who are going to drive us to Georgia Saturday. We will all spend the night in Georgia and then, off to the trail Sunday morning for me and my hubs. The last two days I have had anxiety. There was a lot to do to get our house in order before we left. By Gods grace we have an amazing house sitter and for this I am so thankful. Everything just fell into place the last few days. I can't wait to get on the trail and start this adventure. It's been crazy lately trying to get a lot of practice miles in and keep up with regular daily household tasks. In the end, whatever didn't get done won't matter anyhow but for the moment, my crazy OCD won't let me rest ?? And nature is calling at the same time.","Georgia

We did get to see a beautiful waterfalls, Long Creek Falls. We only got 9 miles in and had to stop at Hawk Shelter to tent camp for the night. Everyone built a fire which was great! We headed to bed early because of the cold. Thomas got a few blisters today and was having muscle spasms in his legs at night. The wind started to blow so hard around 1:30am I could feel it through the tent and my sleeping bag so Thomas switched spots because his was warm, It was bitter cold","Springer Mounain

Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556303,This morning started out so windy and cold we could barely get moving at our campsite.   My fingers were frozen and my toes were NOM Thomas had to take my shoes off to warm my toes before we could start hiking. We hiked up sassafras Mountain today it was pretty steep we both had to stop several times. We were headed to Gooch shelter but there were so many people on the trail the shelter was really full so we push Thomas to hike another mile and a half to a campsite. Two guys were building a fire and having trouble and asked if anyone knew how to build a fire so of course Thomas suggested I help them while he put up the tent. I took one look at the wood they were using and went out and got some nice drive pieces I told them I wiould get the wood and show them how to start it but they had to blow on it . We got it started in a couple minutes and had it blazing a few minutes later. We cooked our dinner by the fire and then got ready for bedIt's drizzling rain right now as we are laying in our tents hopefully it will stay that way and not get worse .,"Hawk Shelter, Georgia

Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556377,"Today we woke up to beautiful snow all over the trees and ground. It was another chilly night. I really didn't mind the snow because it was better packing up our stuff in snow than it would be if it was raining. We started at Gooch gap and hiked to Woody gap which was about a 4 mile hike. We decided to find a place to bunk down for the night because it is supposed to be in the teens and even colder up in the mountains. So from Woody Gap we started the 2mike hike on 60N to Suches and someone picked us up, we rode in the back of his pick up, and he drove us the next 1.5 miles. We are staying at Two Wheels of Suches in a quaint little red cabin. We have showers, yes! Tomorrow we have someone driving us back to where we stopped hiking and we are going to hike without our backpacks for about 11 miles which will include Blood Mt. (Sounds like a good Mt to hike without our packs). We plan on getting picked up and briought back to the cabin to spend one more night if possible.","Gooch Gap Campsite

Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556502,"Today we had a wonderful breakfast of muffins and fresh coffee compliments of Mary and Skip from Two Wheels of Suches. Then Mary called retired Ranger, Mr. Bud to see if he would give us a ride to Jared gap so we could hike from Jared gap down to Woody gap without our backpacks and then return to the cabin for the night. Mr. Bud graciously drove us there and told some great stories about the Mountains, Rams Rock, and Preachers Rock. I asked him about all the beautiful mica schist I was seeing along the trail and he told us there were many things they manufactured with it. I also have been seeing a lot of crystal quarts on the mountain trails. Mr. Bud dropped us off and we hiked about 1/2 mile to get to the trail. We had on 3-4 layers of clothes because it was 2degrees with the wind chill in some places. The mountains were full of snow and beautiful ice crystals. We hiked the 6 miles back to Woody Gap then walked 2 more miles to get to our cabin. We are staying tonight and tackling Blood Mountain in the morning. It was great to slackpack as they call it without our backpacks. We finished our hike and we were back at the cabin before 1:30. We had some pizza at the only store for miles and there was a little motivation typed on the box that said ""The task ahead of you is never as great as the Power within you."" We will remember this.","Jarred Gap

Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556765,"Today we hiked Blood Mountain. I told My husband before we hiked up that I bet the hike down willl be rough because they probably named it so because the decent is so steep your toes hit the end of your shoes and bleed. The decent was mostly rock, some were so huge I think most of the Mountain was a huge Rock and it was very intense with the mud and ice. When we got to Neel Gap we stopped at the store there then bought a couple packages of food for dinner. We rested for an hour and a half before continuing our hike to Swaim Gap Ridge. There was no water in between but a gentleman named Paul had an app on his phone to helped us find water two tenths of a mile up the trail. It was a tiny spring but it was perfect and was still flowing. It was getting really windy so I put the tent up while Thomas cooked us dinner and made something hot to eat. I made a fire and found lots of wood to burn but the wind was so crazy even by the fire it was hard to get warm. It was still really cold probably because we were on a ridge but we did have a beautiful view of the mountains. It was one of the coldest nights for me but Thomas said he was fine. I'm not looking forward to waking up in this cold.","Woody Gap

Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556894,"Today we got a slow start because it was still cold and windy. It was the coldest night for me sleeping but Thomas said he was fine. Later the sun came out and it was a beautiful day. Thomas has been coughing the last few days and was moving slow today. I tried to occupy his mind by asking a lot of questions about him playing baseball as a kid. He wanted to stop a lot and I just wanted to keep going. I was getting a little frustrated. The photo is one of the times he made me stop and I swear he would have taken a nap if I let him. Lol! ??. We started hiking at 10 am and got to Lower Gap Shelter tent area around 5pm. Thomas made a fire, got more water and cooked dinner while I put up the tent and got our mattresses and sleeping bags organized. More hikers , Bob, Bruce, Mark a couple from Ohio and their two beautiful dogs and also a couple of very nice guys we talked to at Neel Gap two days ago, (I really need to pay attention to names, lol) came to enjoy the fire and set up their tents near us. There were around 35 people camping at this site. We went to bed at 9 pm.","Swaim Gap

Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556936,"Today we hiked an easy 5 miles first on a fairly flat ridge. There was a beautiful misty fog and I watched an owl swoop down from the mountain above and disappear below. My husband was really struggling saying his shoulders were hurting no matter how we adjusted his pack. I knew he was not feeling well because he coughed most of the night. He started asking me how far we had gone (hoping it was more) when we had only gone . 5 miles. I was really pushing him so we could get another 5 miles and to a hotel. Around 6 miles he said he was going to get rid of the food because it weighed too much but I made him give it to me and added it to my pack hoping to lighten his pack enough to get him to move faster. The trail got very muddy and rocky and was a steep decline for a couple miles and it was wearing on my ankles. I had called for a ride to the hotel to meet us so I was way ahead of Thomas trying to make sure we got there on time. When I could see the parking lot from the trail which was another quarter mile, I left my pack and went back up to find Thomas. I made him take off his pack and I carried it down to where mine was so he could rest. We met our ride at Unicom Gap and a wonderful lady drove us to the hotel. I washed our clothes, we got showers, found a place to eat, got Thomas some medicine and went to bed.","Lower Gap Shelter

What a wonderful staff and Dr Kilee Smith! We both have flue symptoms and I have a sinus infection so she prescribed us some meds which we picked up at Fred's. We've been resting all day and we will definitely take another day to rest. We are hoping to be better by Wednesday morning to continue our hike but not sure if that will be possible as we are still not feeling great. We are off the trail for now but thankful it's just the flu and not an injury that would make us quit our journey. Prayers appreciated for us.","Hiawassee, Georgia

We decided to make it a short day and only hiked 6 because we were still recovering from the flu. We hiked a very steep mountain and ended up settling camp at the top of tree Mountain. We had a fantastic view once we got our tent set up and built a nice fire. We sat at the top of huge rocks and relaxed in the sunshine. We met a young man named !maverick! Who cooked with us over our fire. We also met the cutest dog named Isis who seemed to love hiking. The wind became violently cold and strong overnight and we didn't want to leave our warm bags when morning came. I was feeling cold , dizzy and nauseated but just wanted to get going to warm up. We decided to eat later and packed up and headed North.","Unicoi Gap

Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557381,"Rough start today because the wind was blowing so hard making it hard to pack up. My fingers and toes were freezing. It was too cold to eat breakfast. We hiked about two miles before stopping and making tortillas with peanut butter and jelly and eating a granola bar. We hiked 7.8 miles and ended at Deep Gap. After setting up the tent, We made a big dinner of beef stroganoff and mashed potatoes because we were both hungry. Later I made hot tea and coffee and then before bed we ate some hot oatmeal. I went to fill the water at the spring and loved how someone used a Mountain Laurel leaf to funnel the water where it trickled down so alll you had to do was hold your bottle under it. Shout out to Cory from St Louis for making a beautiful toasty fire tonight! Met some great people tonight one young lady from Pittsburgh too. I'm sleeping in my coat tonight for now anyways. We are really hoping it will warm up tomorrow.","Tray Mountain Shelter

We wanted to pick up some more fuel for cooking. It was a very clean and organized place. We met a nice lady with the trail name of Kinder. We were both hungry so we ordered a pizza which they cooked for us and ate it there. We left around 1:30. The owner gave us a ride back to Dicks Creek. He said we looked familiar and that he had a photographic memory then, proceeded to tell us, he saw us a few days ago in the grocery store, I was trying on glasses and Tom was waiting for me. Pretty cool he could do that. We hiked another 4.5 miles and set up camp I at Plumorchard Shelter where several of the hikers we met the night before were also staying.

I have been so hungry the past few days I was going to get some hotdogs. Ha, ha! We hiked a total of 12.2 miles today and also crossed into North Carolina. When we got to Deep Gap some wonderful people were cooking hotdogs for us and they also had cookies, beer, Gatorade and apples for us. Those were the best hotdogs I ever had! After we ate we hiked another mile to Standing Indian Shelter. Cory, Erin, Kaylyne, Kevin, Taylor and her Dad, Curtis were at the shelter again with us along with a nice group of section hikers from Florida.

We hiked on a ridge for another mile or so and finally found a place to camp that was an old Forest Road. Some other guys camped there with us we found a beautiful running spring water really close by. We ate our dinner and were in bed by 8:30. We were awoken at 10:30 by pouring down rain, thunder and lightning and the wind was blowing our tent like crazy.

We were trying to get there by 9:30 so we could catch the shuttle into Franklin. We made it with 5 minutes to spare. When we got to Franklin we had a huge breakfast at Kountry Kitchen. I had been really hungry the last two days. We got a room at Comfort Inn, washed our cloths, showered and went to dinner at Fatz. I was craving a big juicy steak! It was delicious!

We went back to Ourdoir 76 because I wanted to ask some questions about my feet and shoes. The owner is very knowledgeable. He helped me find exactly what I needed for my feet.

It was getting cold throughout the day, the wind was picking up and we knew it was going to rain overnight. We cooked our dinner, ate and got in our tent. The Boy Scouts were laughing, hollering and having a blast. It rained and the wind was really strong overnight. I was actually praying no trees would fall on our tent.

It was really sad.   We came across to huge lookout tower and climb to the top of it. The views were amazing. You could see where some of the mountains were burnt and some were not; there was no pattern and it made no sense, the wind must have blown the fire in several different places. There were only a few people at the shelter where we stopped for the night. We set up our tent, cooked dinner, filled our water and went to bed at 8 pm.","Wayah Bald Shelter

I actually had to sit down to go down some of the rocks, it was so steep. Most of the dangerous sections were where the fire had burned away the trees. The weather was phenomenal it reached above 70° today. We walked down the mountain to the Natahala outdoor center. It is geared to kayakers. We decided to get something to eat while we were there. Today I saw a lot of beautiful flowers starting to bloom on the trail and I saw my first Trillium in full bloom . After we ate we decided to hike further before setting up camp it was up hill for 3 miles before we found a nice little spot to camp which also had a spring so we could fill our water.

Aside from all the uphill climbs it was over 80 degrees today and we were sweating like crazy. We also applied sunscreen at least 10 times because we kept sweating it off.

We reached the shelter around 2:30 but decided to stop hiking for the day so we could get our clothes somewhat dry before morning. We slept in the shelter because it was supposed to continue raining through the night. One hiker, Zeus. Started to tell us about a guy who played an April fools joke on him. He said as he was hiking by this guys campsight , the guy said ""hey I'll have bacon and eggs ready in a minute"", then Zeus said REALLY? The guy then said, ""no, I'm kidding"" so Zeus said, ""Ihate you and I'm going to burn your Steeler hat!""

The hiking path in this area is worn down and we were hiking through a lot of cold mud. We got to the shelter found a spot for our sleeping mats and bags. This shelter had a tarp over the open side which was great because it was facing the direction the wind was blowing.

The mud was getting sloppier and deeper and was mixed with snow. We were moving slow because with every step our feet were sliding, especially on the downhills. We arrived at the Shelter and shortly after the ridge runner named Chloe arrived as well. She asked us not to cook inside the shelter because it could draw the bears inside. It was difficult cooking outside because it was so cold so we cooked dinner and ate it very fast. All 19 people in the shelter where in their sleeping bags by 8 pm","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Chloe stayed at at our shelter again and let some hikers build a fire since it was so cold. We had a mom with two sweet girls 7 and 9yrs old in our shelter. When we got there there was a small space for us on the top row of the shelter so we set up our mats and bags. Since we were so cold we didn't eat dinner but climbed in our bags to get warm.

One hiker poured hot water on his shoes so he could get his feet in them. It was a painful experience for sure. The snow that had fallen the night before had turned to ice on the trail making it difficult to hike on. The last two days Thomas and I both fell about 3 times. Texas Ranger was hiking with us with the plan to go to Gatlinburgh for a couple days to let the trail melt and dry up. We reached Clingmans Dome today which is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail, 6,667 ft. The views from the dome were amazing and the wind was bitterly cold. The road to the dome was closed so we walked another 8 miles to the main road. The sun was out and it was a lot warmer. Thomas got us a ride into town because he noticed a young man with a Pittsburgh Pitate shirt and started talking to him. He grew up near Pittsburgh.

Thomas and I visited the outfitters to resupply our food and snacks and buy more Feul for cooking. Thomas found a field and stream hat in the hikers box and took it to wear on the trail after he washed it. We had a fantastic dinner then stopped at a store ( I believe it was called Dad's) across from the NOC. We found some great snacks and the clerk there said if we stopped by in the morning we could get sandwiches to take on the trail with us for lunch so that was our plan.

I am anxious to get to the next town to buy some new pants or shorts because my pants no longer fit and I have to tuck my shirt in to keep my pants up. 7 Beers and Cubs Win caught up with us today and showed up at our campsight tonight. They started farther down the trail than us when we left Gatlinburgh. It was a great night so we put the tent up.

Thomas his blisters were still bothering his feet so he hiked ahead of us. Our hike ended at standing bear hostel. It was a very rustic place but even had a general store with a few items to purchase. There were outside showers, but believe me, even these were very refreshing.

We wanted to get to Hot Springs because we had a resupply package waiting for us there. It was another beautiful sunny day. We came across a cute little lizard while we were hiking and he graciously posed for some photos. He would not let me get a photo of his sapphire blue belly.

Thomas and I stayed at an old historical house called Sunnybank Inn which was built in the 1840s. Supposedly the first AT Hiker stayed there. A very nice man named Elmer lived there, owned, and managed the Inn. He had the cutest dog named Jimmy Carter and two adorable cats named Pearl and Earl. Thomas and I both were amazed of his extensive book collection. The Inn was situated across the street from a lovely diner where we had an enormous and delicious breakfast when we arrived. We found a laundromat, did our laundry then visited the outfitters and Dollar General to resupply our food. Later we had dinner at the Grill across from the outfitters. After dinner Thomas and I took a walk down past the laundromat across a beautiful old red bridge. We saw a lot of people in Hot Springs that we knew from hiking the trail.","Deer Park Mt Shelter

The owner, Elmer made breakfast and we had eggs with ramps, granola, grits, gravy and biscuits, blood oranges, and cantaloupe. After breakfast Thomas, myself, Seven Beers, Cubs Win and Texas Ranger attended church for Easter Sunday. It was a small congregation and the church was happy to see us. When they passed around communion a whole loaf of bread was split in half and I could see Thomas's eyes light up as he tapped me on the shoulder and I told him stop because I knew he was going to tell me he wanted a big bite that big loaf of bread. Lol! We went back to the outfitters for resupply and ended up spending the next four hours there sitting on the bench out front because that was the only place in town that had Wi-Fi. Later we met up with the rest of our crew and had dinner at the Grill across the street from the outfitters.","Hot Springs NC

We met up with Texas Ranger, seven beers, and Cubs win and headed out of town. The temperature was in the 70s and the sun was shining. We saw some beautiful views of the river in Hot Springs as we climbed up the mountains but after that there weren't many other views and it was kind of a boring day of hiking. It was really hot and humid. Seven Beers went ahead because he is younger and faster than the rest of us. Texas Ranger saw a black snake on the trail today. My feet were hurting today and I noticed they were both swollen. I don't think I drink enough water while we were in town. I was happy when we got to camp around 430. We saw a little store called Mom's down the road which was an experience in itself to visit. There were a couple of coolers of drinks and ice cream and candy bars at the counter. In the middle of the floor was a huge pile of firewood right next to an old beat up couch and chair. We got a cold soda and an Ice cream sandwich and went back to our camp sight. We set up our tent, Texas Ranger made a fire, and Thomas cooked dinner. When we finished eating, it started to pour down rain so we grabbed our stuff and hurried into our tents and we didn't come out for the rest of the night. It hailed a little at first. The peepers (tree frogs) we're happy and we fell asleep to their songs.","Hot Springs NC

It wasn't really cold but there was a drizzle of rain all day long. It was foggy outside so there were no scenic views when we got to the top of the mountains. Seven beers and Cubs Win left before we did and we spent most of the Day with Texas Ranger trying to catch up to them. We had plans to meet them at Jerry's Cabin Shelter 12.1 miles away. We finally caught up to them about 2 miles from the shelter and seven beers had fallen and and wasn't feeling well. Texas Ranger and I (Curls), my trail name both slipped and fell on some rocks today also but didn't get hurt. Cubs win was having problems with his Achilles tendon and said he may have to go into town tomorrow to get it checked out.

We got a ride from 10K (Tom) and J-Walker (Marie) who will shuttle hikers pretty much anywhere. You can find them in the AT Guide under Shuttles by Tom. We hiked 20.2 miles. We started at 8am and finished at 5pm. This was the longest distance we have hiked. At the top of Unaka mountain the forest was full of green moss it was gorgeous and looked like an emerald forest. On the other side of the mountain was a Christmas tree decorated with ornaments to honor a young man. Part of the trail coming off the mountain was really rough. Aside from it being downhill, it had tons of roots with sand and broken sandstones making it hard to stabilize each step. My ankles and the bone above my instep were taking a beating and my feet were really sore. At one point we both took off our shoes and socks and soaked our feet in the ice cold stream that ran along the last half of the trail. Once we got back to our room we ordered pizza because we didn't feel like walking anymore, lol.","Iron Mt Gap

I ran the last 2 miles because the ground was downhill with no roots or rocks and of course I did not have a big heavy backpack on. We got back to our hotel around 1 PM got cleaned up and went to dinner at Hawgs and dawgs with Texas Ranger, Cubs Win, Seven Beers, and Jim. The food and service were both fantastic!

Leslie Marshall,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561407,"One more day of slackpacking. The day started out fairly nice, it was around 60 degrees when we started at 7:15 am. About 5 miles into our hike we found a bear track right in the middle of the trail. It started to rain pretty hard around 12:45 but only lasted 15 minutes which was enough to get soaked and turn some of the trail to 3 inches of mud making it hard to walk without slipping. We were disappointed when we reached Big Bald because it was covered in fog, got very cold and windy and we didn't have a view. We ran into trail magic 3 times today which was awesome! The first 11 miles of our hike were good even though a lot was uphill. After that, the trail was very muddy for 5-7 miles. Thomas was actually hiking as fast as me today which was great because I wanted to finish the 21.9 miles before 5pm. We had 2 miles to go when I started hiking faster and then ran the rest of the way and got to Devils Fork Gap at 4:55pm. When we got back to the hotel, Stephanie (Bartender) and Jim (also a through hiker) asked us if we wanted to go to Los Jalapeños for dinner with them. Jim, Stephanie, Matt, Steem, and Doug all had dinner with us. We had a great night full of stories and lots of laughter!","Devils Fork Gap

We did some laundry then went to Walmart to restock our food and some other things we needed. We had lunch at an Italian restaurant near Walmart with Jim, seven beers, Texas Ranger, Thomas and I. Our shuttle driver Doug, who we had dinner with last night, showed us some unique fishing lures he had made out of horse, rabbit, and deer hair. I'm not looking forward to hiking tomorrow morning because it is supposed to be 52° and raining and I'm sure it will be colder at the top of the mountains. I am hoping the sun will come out and dry the mud off of the trails.","

The beginning of today's hike started not too bad but as the day progressed the Climb got steeper and steeper to Roan High knob shelter. As we got towards the top of the mountain it became foggy and damp and rained a little there were about two miles of high rocks to step over and the path was a rocky ditch sometimes with streams of water running down. Most of the path near the top had no views because there were many pine trees. When we reached the Shelter, the aroma of fresh pine made it smell just like Christmas and I knew I was going to sleep well.

Today was one of the worst days for me. The calf muscle in my right leg had a huge knot and it was making it hard to walk. I used compression wrap over the right spot and it seemed to help for a while. We hiked for 11 miles up and down without much change in elevation so it was icy mist and wind for several hours. We were on several bluffs but had no view because of the weather. It seemed like it was taking us all day to get out of the clouds. We finally left North Carolina and settled in a campsite. Texas Ranger made a fire and we all ate our dinner around it. The campsite had a huge rock formation that looked like a cave so 7Beers and I climbed it to see how deep it was. It was only 8 feet deep and was damp inside but it made the campsite unique.,"Roan HighKnob Shelter

Thomas and I wanted to get into Hampton because we had a resupply package waiting for us. Today's hike was Beautiful. It followed and crossed over the Laurel Fork river several times. Then it led to Laurel Falls. The trail down to the falls was several switchbacks of huge rock stairs that were very steep. When we got to the bottom by the falls we had to maneuver around a 2 foot ledge with a high Rockwall on one side and the gushing river on the other. Today was one of the most beautiful days of hiking I truly enjoy the sound of the  rushing river beside us most of the day. We got to town around 2 PM and got a room at Braemar castle hostile. It was a beautiful big stone building that used to be a Pittsburgh lumber company but was now owned and run by the Browns. The caretaker at the hostel drove us to the post office to pick up our package and dropped us off at Subway so we could get something to eat.
