Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555108,They say that the journey of 1000 miles begins with the first step.   In many ways it begins long before the first step.   The journey begins when the decision is made that the journey will be made. I can't really say when I made the final decision and in some way I've been making this decision my whole life.   Perhaps the decision was made when I bought my ticket for it Lanae and called Ron Brown and arrange my shuttle ride to Springer.   In retrospect I should have picked a date other than March 1 as it seems that many hikers chose that date to start.   The last thing one wants when retreating to the wilderness is to find themselves in the midst of crowds.   I'm sure after a few days or a few weeks things will thin out and I'm hoping to establish a good rhythm of 15 miles a day or better. I have tried to convince myself that this long journey is just a series of shorter journeys. First phase make it to Damascus Virginia in about a month second phase crossed the Mason-Dixon line into Pennsylvania in about 5 weeks. Next phase make it to Vermont. and finally take the long hard walk across the White Mountains of New Hampshire through southern Maine and onward to the end.   The first phase I have broken down into three sections; from Springer To Stecoah gap; from there through the Great Smoky Mountains into Hot Springs North Carolina and from there onward to Damascus. sounds like a plan let's get walking,,Getting ready,"Feb 25, Sat",0
Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555162,I'm finishing my preparation I have my boxes ready to mail I still have to try to fit all my gear into my small pack I have a nice duffel for my wood poles my sleeping roll my tent in my backpack I figure I will check that and carry-on the rest I'm a little bit anxious but I guess that's normal but certainly didn't disturb my sleep last night I spent a couple hours yesterday on an interesting plumbing issue and it reminds me to thank my son Jake who is taking on the burden of care for my buildings without which I couldn't take this hike so thanks Jake I have so many little things to do like move my truck off the road it has a dead starter lock up clean up pack up wrap up cover up get up and most of all get going and keep up I know this is going to be a little boring to read until I get some more interesting things to talk about but I appreciate everyone's interest and I'm fully committed quitting is not an option let's go,,View Entry,"Feb 26, Sun",0

",Hot Springs NC. Sunnybank Inn,"Mar 21, Tue",13.10
Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557319,I can't express how much I liked Hot Springs North Carolina what a cool town I really hope someday I can go back and visit maybe start there and do a hike to Fontana dam anyway it was a pretty big climb from the French broad River up some cliffs to higher elevation I continue to climb most of the day and starting at 3 PM meant that I finished after dark around 930. The shelter which is very small it was full and I can't avoid camped with my head that big tree The way I always do. I slept pretty well until the wind woke me up. There is no threat of rain and I would probably be cold but for my north face 0° bag which I love . It is keeping me warm and I am making this journal entry through talking which I haven't been able to do for a while. I'd have to say to be perfectly honest that I am somewhat physically tired. I haven't taken zero day yet. I don't feel strong enough to hike 20 miles in a day although 15 seems to be not too much trouble. My feet are holding up well. My knees and back and back are also feeling pretty good. Although it was warm and almost 80° when I was in Hot Springs a huge thunderstorm came through while I slept safely inside. This has dropped the temperature back considerably and I'm sure it is below freezing right now and very windy. Although I would prefer to be in the shelter I feel comfortable sleeping outside as I can see all the stars and the chance of rain is probably near zero. I have not begun to get too lonely and I have met up with some of my friends from the days of freezing near Clingmans Dome. That would be sequoia laser snake and Alexis. Also I hiked for a while today with potato and another young woman who is trying to get into med school. There are a lot of nice people out here it's rather enjoyable to talk with them I'm not sure what now many miles I will do today. It is almost 5 in the morning and I need more and I need more sleep. I know some of you wish and I would write more and I can only say it is with considerable weber that I have been able to update this journal with my mileage and a few pictures each night or every other night. My thoughts and my feelings are things that I am not always in touch with while walking around in the woods out here. The place that I stayed in Hot Springs called the Sunnybank in Houston a woman who collected Appalachian folk Music for many years from the locals and three traveling around Hot Springs which to be perfectly honest I can only accurately described as a true hillbilly town. At sometime in the 1920s or 30s a woman from England visited the Sunnybank in and published some of the Appalachian folk music. There was a music room in the house and I took the opportunity to play a little guitar. My calluses are not there. Nevertheless I was able to to strum with fairly good rhythm and I enjoyed playing. I have been somewhat troubled by the business details surrounding the replacement of the roof on my building in Maryland and I have lost a little sleep over it over it. I'm not really sure how that will be resolved. I'm not going to let it spoil my trip and I'm sure it will work out in the end. And may all the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace amen,"Hot Springs NC. Sunnybank Inn

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557462,So I tried to pick up my mileage a little bit today but I started late. So I got to the shelter before the one I slept that little Laurel shelter and everyone was having dinner at around 530 so I had a snack. And then proceeded to hike the next 5 miles thinking as the is the trail book showed it was reasonably flat however it was strewn with boulders and rocks and I couldn't do better than a mile an hour. So I got into camp around 930 and thank God there were only three people in the shelter I got my water cooked up my dinner made some coffee laid on my bed roll and slid into my sleeping bag eating my food in the shelter. I got everything wrapped up around 11 PM fell asleep woke up early but didn't leave early and I'm just making this update on my way to the next shelter,"Spring Mountain Shelter

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557526,I hiked while being tired today. The downhills are fine but the uphill was tough. I got in just as it got dark. Around 830. There was a huge group at the shelter and the water was a quarter mile away. But there was a big fire. I cooked and ate with Stretch and Whistler and Potato. When done I smoked half an El Rey Del Mundo to celebrate 300 miles. I was delicious. It's not yet 11 pm but I'm the only one left enjoying this fabulous fire. I'm going to cowboy camp tonight.

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557651,The walking was easy today the trail was a good flat trail bad a lot of it was downhill although there was 3 miles of uphill it made for a swift travel. I had a nice rest up on big bald and took a few pictures. You could see the great Smokies and all the mountains that I've walked through since then. I'm trying hard to keep my miles up and my mind off other matters. The weather has been nice although it rained this morning and I got a late start and extra sleep. Nothing wrong with that. I'm going to walk past Erwin Tennessee and try to do another 15 miles today. I have a re-supply at greasy's hostil. Walking 20 miles give me a small heel blister probably my first. I really can't complain about my health or my food supply. I feel fairly strong and know that this is a long long long journey. I'm looking forward to many parts of it. Don't worry.

",No Business Shelter,"Mar 25, Sat",20.70
Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557715,So I slept in a little bit today because it was raining. I also slept in because I was tired after the 20 mile hall yesterday. I guess I got underway around 11 AM after the rain had stopped and the sun came out. I had a fast hike down hill towards Erwin Tennessee and I got a good picture of the river from the cliffs on the way down. Once at the bottom I am mediately saw Johnny's a hostile. I stopped in and bought three Dr. peppers. They were delicious. I also found a box of macaroni and cheese which had been offered to me by a section hiker at the shelter. Since it had come back into my life I decided to eat it and I split it with mule. We cooked each half in our jet boil and I must say it also was delicious. I then pack my things but first I weighed my pack I weighed my pack with little food and some water and it weighed in at 33 pounds I would like to share about 5 pounds. So I packed out after using the restroom which was nice after having no privy to use for several shelters. I hauled ass uphill for a while meta-nice local who encouraged me to stay at the shelter. Since it was only 10.5 miles to the shelter from my previous day I thought that was too short of a day and I checked the shelter out and moved on. I stopped to get water around 7 PM and decided to face time my children who were all having dinner at my eldest sons house Billy. I got through and got to see them all and I'm very happy to see that they know to stick together even when I am not a round. I was glad to see them and I discovered during the call that my headlamp was out. I unpacked my back up flashlight and hiked on to where I am now just above Indian great gap not too close to the not too close to the road. Stealth camping here. I will cook some more food I'm finding that I am hungry all the time. I also weighed myself at John's hostile with all my clothes on the scale read The scale read one 8180 pounds is a pretty good loss of weight for me although I feel strong and I'm eating like a horse. I left some good friends down at the hospital who are in the backyard happily drinking beer after getting showers. I will hike on another day and stop at Gracies shelter I'm sorry greasy hostile.

Got my broken headlamp shipped to Amazon. Got a small cheap emergency headlamp. Got my resupply box. Now I have to pack up and leave. I want to rest but I will make it to the top of Roan.

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558099,I hiked with Yogi and boo-boo for a lot of the day today. I left the shelter at about 1030 and made my way down Roan mountain. I made pretty good time and it was looking like a decent mile day until the bright sunshine and the great views slowed my progress and I laid in the sun for a while instead of hiking. I did make a late day push and Yogi boo-boo and their two dogs were on my heels most of the day through some very beautiful Highland to rain. I was absolutely committed to getting out of North Carolina and I pushed on until I reach the doll flats and the sign indicating that I was leaving north Carolina for the last time. I was just passed mile marker 39 day and met a section hiker in his 60s with very sore feet. He showed me where the water path was and I got water for my meal. I decided to cowboy camp because it had been a beautiful sunny day and I'm looking at the stars now. It has however gotten extremely windy and I am using my pack as a windshield for my face and of course I am against a large tree. I hope the sucker doesn't fall down in this wind. Anyway I guess my body feels OK. I know I am fatigued and I am trying to figure out a path to Damascus in the least possible days without pushing myself too much. It will be nice to wrap up this section of the AT and to relax in Damascus I probably sound like a broken record but these short term goals and temporary way points are important mentally. I certainly don't want to think about all the hills mountains valleys rocks and difficult terrain I have to cross between now and the finish. My meals have been tasty although I need to stock up on more snacks as my hunger is becoming in satiable. I also have to wrap up this message and get on Amazon and order a new headlamp so that I have one when I leave Damascus. Peace all,"Roan High Knob Shelter

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559049,So today was a little different from most of my days. I woke up at 5 AM and decided to cook breakfast and coffee. I soon realized that I was wide-awake and I pack my things up for my cowboy camp and started hiking. By the time I reached The shelter that was warmed up and most people had still not left the shelter. I decided I was going to have a long day and try to push for wise shelter a 20 mile stretch. Because I'm not a very fast Taiper soon many people were passing me . I kept liking the weather was nice I felt good and I came into the shelter at a reasonable hour of about 530. Unfortunately why shelter was full. I should mention that I hiked out into Graceland Highlands and so many ponies and many interesting rock formations on the large balds. It was a good day and I was sorry that I did not have a spot in the shelter. I considered sleeping on the picnic table because rain was expected. I told the people in the shelter I was going to do that but later change my mind as it was very windy and I envisioned wind driven rain forcing me to have a bad night sleep. So I pulled out big Agnes for the second time in this whole journey. That is correct I have only use my tent twice and I have logged 500+ miles in this journey. That's correct I had a 20 mile day reached a total of 502.3 miles on the Appalachian Trail and I saw ponies. In fact the ponies came right into our camp by the shelter. It ended up raining quite a bit but I had a very good night sleep nevertheless,"AT and Virginia Creeper Trail after Saunders

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559230,I feel pretty good today. I started late about 10:45 and walked fast on a fairly flat trail. I kept going strong with out of break until I reached the shelter between mine and my destination. I ate a little lunch and pushed on and before I knew it the day it was practically over and I was approaching partnership shelter at about 630. Not bad 19 miles in that many hours. I'm going to try to have another good day tomorrow. There were two guys at the shelter and it was a double level shelter so I took the top loft cooked my dinner and went right to sleep.

I also stopped in at the barn and had to hike or burger pound of ground beef . It did a good job fueling the rest of my day. I also crossed the 550 mile mile stone and I'm now one quarter done the entire Appalachian trail. That's pretty significant. I saw some sublime beautiful parts of Virginia right at sunset the beauty I can't even describe. I tried to take pictures and realized that I should just sit and enjoy the moment. Right at a river crossing I met a guy named Papa fish it was from Pennsylvania actually from Delaware County. Small world. It was great to get to the shelter and see familiar faces and new old friends. I slept after enjoying my dinner and a fire and would've slept peacefully but for a restless hiker next to me who just couldn't seem to get to sleep. If that wasn't enough he decided to restart the fire at 4:15 in the morning cracking sticks loudly until the entire shelter rebelled against that idea. All in all one of my best days. I certainly enjoyed lunch with some section hikers from Chicago turtle and I can't remember the other fellas name. Unfortunately one of them left his hiking poles in the vestibule at the restaurant and got into an Uber before I could catch them. Oh well. Maybe they'll go back for them maybe not. One of the sayings on the trail is ""the trail provides "". I guess is that true actually I said I guess that is true. Well I have to admit that right now I'm just still laying completing a 2000 foot climb and it's easier to sit here then it is to saddle up my pack and finish this walk but I think I better do that.

I also stopped on the way up and talk to my cousin and my son for about an hour and a half. So by the time I was ready to do the last 10 miles it was already 5 o'clock.

I walked slow because I was tired and it was hot. They were waiting with a 2016 thru hiker named pidgeon toe who was giving out trail magic.

Mom was with Cyrilia, Potato and Acorn back from town when I arrived. Then Kiwi came up. I'm glad they got to meet my parents and my parents met my trail family. I hoe I can catch them again.

I probably could've hiked some more miles but I took it easy because I'm carrying too much food. I got my base way down but I obviously over packed on food. The good part about that is that I can resolve it by eating it. When I got to the shelter there was a guy in a Hamic section hiker and Dr. Jay the through hiker no I'm sorry he is also a section hiker. He tented so I had the shelter to myself. I finished smoking the cigar I got in my dropbox which was delicious I cooked my meal ate it and promptly fell asleep. I'm going to try to have a good day today maybe push out some miles we'll see.

It was pretty cool the guy leave sodas for hikers and you can camp in his yard by the stream. You use a zip line to cross the creek. I slept well there were four other hikers with me and I needed the rest. I'm trying to keep my miles up and trying to do a 20+ Mile day every third day.

I got to the shelter at plenty of time and light to cook my meal and lay out my things. There was tons of firewood Cut and split and we made an awesome fire. I smoked some of my cigar relaxed and thought about my trip so far. I enjoy it out here it is very physical and in some ways it is demanding. But in other ways it is relaxing and easy. It's very simple to know that you need to sleep eat and walk. That's it. It makes me realize how much we over complicate our lives and the essence of living.

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561028,So this will give you an idea of what a through hike or does on his day off. First of all I got in today I'll Ville at about 6 PM and I checked into my hotel and I got my laundry together and my six dollars in quarters. Realizing I would be washing almost all of my clothing I decided the best thing to do would be to shower. My shower takes about 25 minutes just to get my body clean. I pay particular attention to my feet as they are doing well and I don't want any problems after my shower I headed to the laundry and put my sleeping bag in the dryer scrounging a dryer sheet from the trash actually two dryer sheets from a box in the trash to freshen up my sleeping bag and I tossed my laundry in the wash and started them both. Then I headed across the street to the Supérate where my dropbox was located. I should add that I was wearing a button up shirt for town longjohns and boxers over the long johns with a rain hat. I got some strange looks for sure . I got my box from the super eight and headed across to the Pizza Hut where I had a large pepperoni pizza waiting for me and I bought a 2 L of Pepsi and headed back to the room with my dropbox pizza and soda. By the time I polished off three quarters of the pizza and three quarters of the 2 L my wash was done . I brought my fluffy sleeping bag back to the room and put my laundry in the dryer and through the TV on and caught the end of half an episode of criminal minds. Yes I admit I like that show. Not sure why. They certainly have some interesting quotes on it from time to time. The last thing I did was shuffle back to the laundry and get my clean dry clothes. I opened my dropbox and packed half of it into my food back. Boy did I sleep well in that bed. I had organized or arranged with the front desk that I would check out at noon so I got up at 6:30 went to breakfast ate eggs muffins bagels orange juice coffee cream cheese anything else I could scrounge and then I headed back to bed for more sleep. I woke up at 11 I quickly packed everything into my bag and took one more shower and then headed to check out. After I checked out I walked a half a mile to the grocery store and bought Ramen's oatmeal cheese salami and they were closing out the Easter candy for a dollar a bag so I bought a lot of candy. I also went to the outfitter and bought gas for my camp stove. Then I went to the UPS store where I shipped half my food midpoint between Daleville in Afton Virginia to a half to a hostile where they will deliver the food to me at the Trailside for five dollars. Not a bad deal. It sure beats carrying it an extra 100 miles. I also bought a cooked chicken in the grocery store so I walked back to the hotel that is that for Johnstons Howard Johnston and I ate the chicken and I packed the rest of the food in my bag and the gas got rid of my trash and somewhere around 3:45 PM I headed out to do 11.2 miles to the next shelter actually two shelters in.

It is always in red ink so it was nice to meet her. I also met a father and daughter hiking at section. They were from Maine which seems strange because I'm walking to Maine. Anyway I had a slow start to the day and I ended up at the shelter 14 miles in at about 6 PM. I decided to push on and I made it to 20 miles to a shelter brand brand Ridge shelter which sleeps 20 people. There was one guy there. His trail name is negotiator. He was glad to have the company it seemed and we talked even though I got to the shelter at 10:30 PM. He was an interesting guy and he told me that his wife told him that he would meet me as she is travel as she is following my progress on trail journals. He told me her name but I forgot it I apologize. But I would like to give a shout out to her. Everybody likes fans and I certainly like people from Alabama.

There is a very good reason most people don't make daily journal entries. On top of everything else we have to do it is a royal pain in the butt. But, I try. I have to also say that I've been thinking a lot about the reading in the Bible where Peter and John heal the cripple sitting outside the temple. I mean it was one thing when Jesus was healing people . But when is follower started healing people in His name I mean that Musta really blown peoples minds. I suspected that powers still available today. Why don't we tap into it? We are afraid. I also have to comment on the part in the reading where they say that they looked at the man intently. What does that mean? Do we ever really look at another person intently?especially a person in need? Could we heal them with the power of Jesus? Why are we afraid to try?","Wilson Creek Shelter

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562139,So today was a strange day. I got off to a good start walking well and was making my way towards Wainsborough without any issues at all. I called the Inn at Afton where my box was sent to make sure they had it and they told me they had no box . They told me to check the Wainsborough post office. I called them and they also told me they had mailbox. So I was not very happy and I got impatient with the walk. I finally reached the Blue Ridge Parkway and I could see the Inn at Afton and the girl told me that at 3 o'clock the regular person would be in and maybe they knew where the box was. So I stopped at a popcorn stand and got two cokes and a hotdog because I didn't think my stomach could handle popcorn right now. While sitting there a guy came up and got in line wearing some very interesting boots. I commented to him about them and he said they matched his vintage motorcycle which was a 45-year-old Harley shovel head. I asked him where he was going and he said he was going to Oley Pennsylvania . Can you believe that? Only a few miles from my home and here I was running into him at the junction of the Blue Ridge Parkway and skyline Drive. I must also admit that I recognized this intersection of roads from years back when I took my young family and our exchange student Juan Cebolla on a road trip and we passed through this area. I recognized it while waiting for my hotdog a gentleman offered me a ride into Waynesboro. This seems to be a regular thing that people from Wainsborough give hikers rides for free into town. This guy not only waited for me he drove me up to the in at Afton and waited for me while I checked on the box which wasn't there he then took me to an outfitter where I got stove gas and electric lights then he took me to the post office in Waynesboro still no box. Then he took me show me the laundromat show me a good place to eat showed me the grocery store and then he took me to the YMCA. They offer hikers free showers and soap and towel so I got a shower and put on clean socks clean shirt and not clean pants. I packed my gear and headed towards the laundromat. On the way I came across a shoe repair shop a cobbler . Because the one strap on my pack is starting to separate which I haven't told anybody about and I stitched with some fish line I figured I would go in and ask him if he could help me. Not only did he help me but I bought a beautiful pair of boots from him cowboy boots which I hear is shipping to my home and I also Learned that he was a musician who made it significant portion of his money through royalties when other people decide to perform his songs and record his songs. We had a very nice conversation and he also gave me a big needle and some wax thread to fix my pack should begin to separate more. Over to the laundromat where I wash my clothes and headed over for a good meal across the street. I'm still at the laundromat allowing my phone headlamp and power source to fully charge which they're not doing. I'm also waiting for this brief thunderstorm to pass so that I can head over to the field behind the Y where they offer free camping for hikers . I didn't even make it to the grocery store yet and I think I left my polls either in the Y or at the cobbler shop which gives me some concern but I'm 90% sure there with the cobbler and he opens at 9 AM tomorrow. So I spent half day on the trail half-day in Wainsborough and I'm going to go grab some food I will have totally different food because my Dropbox never made it to Wainsborough for the end at Afton forfeited make it there I hope somebody enjoyed the food. I have to say I met some very very nice people including the guy working in the laundromat clearing the woman who waited on me at the restaurant colluding the cobbler colluding the guy behind the desk in the Y including the shadow man pretty much everyone. I kind of wish my drop box for to come through I was looking forward to that cigar. Lucky for me I have a half a Cuban Romeo and Juliet that a guy in Hot Springs North Carolina gave me.

I got to a shelter and a guy named putting  putting pudding was there. Also a guy from Pennsylvania who lives among the Amish. We all talked and had a pretty good time. I have to say that 1000 miles is a long way to walk . And the problem with the Appalachian Trail is that you're not even halfway done. It's a long long walk. I am enjoying it quite a bit. I've seen a lot of wildlife and beautiful flowers. I've met a lot of nice people.  I've been very very cold and hot sometimes on the same day. I'm glad to be out here.

Great hot water!  I met some flip-flop or's who are just started out their trail names were detour and not yet. It was good to talk to them and I got a picture of them at the Washington monument.

While at the shelter I met Headbones and Minnie and Konan who were from West Chester doing a flip flop out of Harpers Ferry. I finally got moving late and I made for the juncture of the AT and horse-shoe trail. So many memories hiking the horse-shoe trail with my boys.

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565072,"so I hiked a long day today. I really wanted to make it to the William Penn shelter and I did.  The reason I wanted to make it to the William Penn shelter is it's my favorite shelter in Pennsylvania. You may ask why and I will tell you. It's not that it's the most beautiful shelter although it is beautiful But that isn't it isn't it. It may be because the spring which is located on the opposite side of the trail is a nice pipe spring but that isn't it either. It may be because they're rebuilding the privy to make it a moldering pretty but that is an editor either. The reason it's my favorite shelter is because William pen is one of my favorite  people. He is up there with George Washington. He Makes clowns like Ben Franklin, James Madison, and even Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson look like juniors. William pen is a first rate founding father and I challenge any of you to do some reading on his life. The letter he wrote introducing himself to the Native Americans the  Indians had word so profound that for centuries the Indians would ""these words and treaties they made with crooked backstabbing Yankees that were nothing like William pen. I should like to be 1/10 of the man that William pen wise and I'm mad that this stupid thing won't capitalize his last name. But enough on Penn. I should mention that I was kept awake last night by a Porky Pine who must've needed salt or food because he kept approaching my cowboy camp throughout the night making  weird Porky Pine noises. I don't know why this thing won't type Porky Pine keeps typing Porky Pine oh well so much for high tech. Anyway I got moving late and before I left camp  A guy came up to horseshoe Trail who is hiking into Duncannon 28 miles. We had a nice chat and he complemented my cowboy camp. Then I took off and I remember all I did was hike pushing and I remember going through switch Taare park that's Swatara  Park. I can't say too much more except that I talked to my son Jake before I made the climb out of Swatara park and I had 6.5 miles to go. I got done around 10 action  actually 930. By the time I made dinner and ate it I was exhausted and falling asleep so I turn off my headlamp and went to bed. So much for bad feet.

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565075,so today was a most excellent day. The weather was beautiful and I slept quite late till 9 o'clock before waking at all. Of course I had plans on meeting Jake at noon and that soon got moved to 1 o'clock because he had problems at my building in Reading and I had problems getting  up. We both work through our problems and we met up on the trail just south of the 501 Crossing. It was really great to see him walking towards me on the trail. I've said this before but I'll say it again I could not be out here hiking this trail now if it weren't for Jake taking the  responsibility of my buildings. I'm very grateful for this. I hope that the weight of it is not been too much for him. I also hope that the next weeks will prove to be easy for him to manage. Anyway  we walked and took some pictures at some nice overlooks and I must say the Pennsylvania is a beautiful state fields woods rocks. And I can say that by the end of the day the rocks were certainly in full swing.  We got to the 501 Crossing and I had an excellent Epson salt foot bath some cokes we checked out the 501 shelter or did we do that when we got back I can't even remember but in any event we got in his car and headed for Pinegrove.  Yeah we did check out the 501 shelter first. In Pinegrove our first stop was the pizza joint and we stayed there for quite a while eating pizza salad homemade bread and nachos. Of course it was too much food and I'm eating some of the pizza now. I recharged  my phone and headlamp while we were eating and when we were done we went to Turkey Hill I got ice tea got minutes for my boost phone and then we had it for Dollar General where I did a resupply. It's all took a good amount of time. By the time we got back to the parking area at 5:01 it was quite late. I then took time to shake down my back removing anything that I could to light my pack. Jake was very patient through all of this and I know we didn't get out of there till after 5:30 PM. We took a few more pictures and he had to head off to his responsibilities with his family and I had it off for 10 miles on the trail the first five of which were rocky as hell. Thank God it didn't get dark until I got through the rocks. I threw my headlamp on and hiked on tall little bit after 10  but I crossed 183 and that leaves me with about 16 miles into Port Clinton where I'll meet Matt and Steph tomorrow Steph and Stephanie their stamp program can't type I said this damn program can't type.  Anyway it should be clear to you all that I'm dictating and too lazy to use my fingers so you get what you get. I really enjoyed seeing my son Jake my son Billy and I'm looking for Mike and I'm looking forward to seeing my other kids. It was also good to see Claire  gabe Arnoldo and Alejandra. Hope you're all doing well I'm doing fine working my way through Pennsylvania and this whole trail. Milestone today less than 1000 miles to Katahdin it's time it's time to start counting down.

It didn't it didn't take too long before I realized it was going to be a rocky walk  but I pushed on and the weather cooperated being not too hot. I was surprised that a lot of the trees were not in leaf so the sun was shining directly on me.

I was surprised when I got to Port Clinton to find that not only  Matt and Steph for coming to see me but also Cassie Cecelia and Tony. It was great to see them. I took a quick Epson salt foot bath before jumping in their car and heading to a diner . Although the diner food for us not the greatest the company was tremendous.

It was nice to have a short day to spend some time with some other hikers . They all hiked out early the next morning and maybe dinner 30 so I like to loan the next day hiked alone the next day.

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566358,I got a 9 o'clock start and hike through some really really interesting swamp area of New Jersey. New Jersey's New Jersey loves its boardwalks. And the Appalachian Trail as a bottom mile board walk through and big swamp . But it was mostly flat having left High Point the trail makes its way east towards another chain of mountains but you really don't to counter towards very late in the day. I stopped at the heavenly hills dairy and did a resupply of fresh fruit  and baked goods. I ate a half a berry pie which was delicious. This is trail then goes up what is known as stairway to heaven. It is a very steep incline and was very crowded with day hikers being  memorial day weekend. I socialized quite a bit. I got to the shelter just before 9 PM while it was getting dark. Toothless and crazy Jay were here the other is having hiked further . Shelter was almost practically empty with toothless the only occupant so I took my spot in the shelter settle down to a night of battle with the mosquitoes. It really wasn't too bad just a little buzzing in the ears. So tomorrow I can wrap up New Jersey. The first of the five a little states before the big to New Hampshire and Maine. I can't wait. I hope you are all doing fine. I am doing OK. I won't lie my feet hurt but I'm not letting that stop me. Carry-on.,"Murray property; cabin

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566839,it was a tough hiking day today. The terrain was very difficult. I know I wasn't going to get a lot of miles in on account of the huge boulder climes and stretches of rocky terrain. It was very beautiful however. I'm surprised  and how nice the Appalachian Trail in New York has been. Unlike Pennsylvania the rocks or gigantic slabs. I encountered some very interesting things one was I came across a mother a dog that I just given birth and I saw the phone get on its feet for the first time the mother seemed uninterested in me and continue licking the tiny fawn.  It was really beautiful. The phone was no bigger than a Chihuahua. I did see it walk with its mother to the edge of the clearing and disappear into the woods. Another thing that I saw was a nest of ravens. They were at high and a cliff wall and  and we're making a tremendous noise thinking I was there mother approaching. I took pictures of both. I also did some hiking with a young fellow who will probably someday do the Appalachian Trail. He help me push on . I also met a group of people from the Downingtown area who were section hiking from Delaware water gap into New York. It was nice to chat with them. I wrap the day up intended by crazy Jay. It was nice because he had a fire going and I got some good rest,"Wawayanda Shelter
",Wildcat Shelter,"May 28, Sun",12.10
Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566840,so the day started with constant rain. I looked at the forecast and saw that it would be clearing around 1 PM. I washed crazy J break up camp and head out into the pouring rain at around 7 AM. Not me! I decided to sleep in and rest and ate several small breakfast meals while napping  till about noon. Is the rain was letting up in the forecast showed clear weather for the remainder of the day I got packed up and got on the trail somewhere between one and 2 PM. I had a 14 mile day to do and I kept hearing that the fingerboard shelter had a trouble with an aggressive bear bear . I didn't really want to stay there at the shelter but the fog and rain rolled in Lake late and I did not make good time over the wet rocks and rough terrain. I'll tell you the last two days of hiking in New York have been tough going. my phone battery died and I didn't even know what time it was. I reached where I thought the shelter would be just as in a Normas fog rolled in at dusk and E Normas fog.  I don't know why this thing can't get in Normas right but I can't. Anyway I stumbled around for about an hour trying to find the shelter. I found signs for the shelter. I found scaffolding for the shelter. I yelled to try to locate the shelter . Still I could not find the shelter in the dance fog. I found out later that close bear mountain because of the intense fog. It was foggy! Eventually I found the shelter with four people in it. This is where the story gets interesting . Being very hungry I decided to eat the zucchini bread I had bought at heavenly hills bakery and dairy bar. While eating the food at around 9 PM the people in the shelter informed me they had seen the bear the trouble there while hanging their food bags.  I made a comment that I would prefer to keep my food bag with me in the shelter exploded in objection. Rather than face the angry lynch mob I informed them that I had sent back my 50 foot rope in a pack shake down and I only had 20 feet of rope so I would need to tie off to their  bags. They agreed to this and after I finished eating one of the fellows got up his trail name was half blind and followed me out to the tree. When I shined my headlamp up to their bags I heard something and looked up and saw a fairly large bear in  tree in the tree. Yes a bear was in the tree where their food bags were hanging. The other guy came out of the shelter with a better light and we could clearly see the bear climbing around in the tray in the tree. I stated that I did not feel comfortable hanging my food bag there and that they should probably remove their's but they insisted that I hang my bag there with their bags. This did not seem like a good idea to me. Hanging a food back in a tree with a bear in it.   They insisted. We proceeded to lower their bags and to clip my bag onto their's. The bear was agitated and made hissing noises climbing higher into the tree. Once my bag was securely fastened to their's  they continued to yell at the bear and the bear eventually came down the tree which made me very uncomfortable because it was dark and foggy and we couldn't really see where the bear was. We all retreated into the shelter where I promptly fell asleep. The next morning at Dawn one of the fellas got up and upon returning to the   Shelter informed us that all the bags were there except for mine. The bear had somehow knocked my bag free and made off with a day and a half of food. Truthfully I had very little food in the bag. However there is a powerful Moral to the story. Don't hang your food bag in a tree with a bear in it!!! Moral to the story. Don't hang your food bag in a tree with a bear in it!!!If I hadn't been so stupid My life would probably have gone a lot smoother. End of story.,"Wildcat Shelter

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566841,so after the food bag incident my shelter mates were kind enough to give me a few energy bars and a cup of coffee and out I went on the trail by 8 AM a rarity for me. I hiked constant Lee and powerfully covering about 9 miles before noon.  That was a fair amount of up and down but no more huge boulder slabs to contend with. I hiked all day up to bear mountain where they had vending machines and I spent $10 in the vending machines on three cokes two boxes of Pringles and the Packers  and a pack of skittles. The lunch of champions. I was fortunate enough to run into Norm who was a fast hiker. He pushed me pretty well and I ended up at the Graymoor spiritual center before 7 PM. Not bad. 22 miles in 11 hours. I met mystical  and Treebeard. Oh I forgot to remember to mention about a mile from the spiritual center we came across a market where I bought a pepper and egg sandwich and a pound of Genoa salami he and provolone cheese and Italian roll Italian loaf and a gal  A gallon of Arnold Palmer. This made for a fine dinner and to find breakfast the next morning and I'm sure lunch will be salami and cheese. The next shelter is 19 miles away and I hear you can order pizza and Chinese food from there so I will be fine for food until I pick up my dropbox  tomorrow. It is 3 miles from the next shelter in Stormville New York. Looking at the weather map I have two good days and then four days of straight rain. I'm not going to lie. This weather is rough. All my socks and shorts are wet and I can't wait to get to a laundry and get a hot shower somewhere. Signing off hope you are all doing well and thanks for reading.

I had a nice slow morning at the Franciscan pavilion.  Treebeard was going to the monestary and possibly off the trail. Twisted hip and knee. Mystical was waiting for her cousin from Kent Conn to pick her up. I got together and was off around 10am.  Hiked will over up and down terrain. Met Blaze and Malink. Saw my turtle friend. Got to within a mile and a half of the shelter around 730 pm when a huge thunderstorm struck. I could have stayed under a pavilion but I wanted to order a pizza at the next shelter given my food situation. I got soaked. Poured on for 25 minutes. When I got to the shelter a full blown pizza party was in progress. Trail angels. More food than I needed and some resupply.  It was worth getting wet.,"Graymore Spiritual Life Center

Before leaving I dried all my clothing by hang them on chairs it was brilliantly sunny which was to continue for the whole day.  It was breezy with very low humidity and the sky was blue blue blue. The walking was a little hard for me I've had some long days and I was tired. I made plans to stop and see my uncle Tom and aunt Susie in Kent Connecticut on Saturday morning   That means after today's 16.8 mile hike I have a 20+ mile hike tomorrow. Well what else happened today I saw a copperhead very aggressive snake. I also talk to an older gentleman named Rich for a while. He was out hiking some rough terrain. You told me about losing his wife  to breast cancer. I told him about losing my wife to whatever it is let's just leave it at that. He said his son went through a similar thing. That's life. We were both out there he also told me  he used to operate overhead cranes in the nuclear industry. He said the most intense thing he did was lift steam generator out of Indian point.

I hate down in the bottom of the hill and I saw what is known as the Dover oak tree. It is the largest oak tree or the largest tree on the Appalachian Trail.  It was a gorgeous day with brilliant blue sky and sunshine. I am countered the appellation Trail railroad station and so I train come through at very high speed. I then went to a nearby nursery where I got a hot shower for five dollars . What a great deal! I said goodbye to Devo and his dog diva and headed out through some more beautiful countryside. I crossed over into Connecticut  and I said goodbye to New York another state done. I don't know why it was taking me a long time to cover distance but it was. I guess it had something to do with the hills. Anyway  by the time I got to the mountain I'll go shelter it was dark. I could not find the shelter. I looked in the AWOL guide and there was no description of where it was at all. I followed a blue place trail to a creek and was getting water when I saw a headlamp over across the stream . It was Mona Lisa and I got the last spot in the shelter for the night.

I met my uncle Tom and aunt Susie as planned at 9 o'clock and I asked them if they could run me back to Stormville New York to get my box which never arrived . They said sure and away we went to Stormville New York about a 35 minute drive. We got my resupply box which had food at toe brace for my bunion and the all-important cigar . Then we went to a diner for a great breakfast. I had a grand slam pancakes and eggs bacon and sausage. I drink a lot of coffee and we had good conversation. Then it was off to the laundromat in Pawling  New York. What a nice little town! We got my Washington and my sleeping bag and my wash in. Then we walked around town . It was really nice day beautiful weather blue sky yellow sunshine green leaves just a gorgeous spring day. We went to Vinnys and I bought A cola and provolone  and I ordered this spaghetti lunch which was delicious. We got the stuff in the dryer and I remember we then had a coffee which was also delicious. It took a while but it was very enjoyable. They are avid hiker's  and we don't get to see each other often. I really enjoyed my time with them. Anyway we went back to the trailhead and when I went to put my shoes on I realized I had left them under the car not wanting to stink up the car with my smelly feet or smelly shoes I put them under the car and we drove away without them . So back to palling where they were waiting for us in the road and then back to the trailhead near Kent. Near Kent. It was 530 before I hit the trail and I walked quickly knowing it was going to be dark by the time I got to the shelter.  I ran into Dakota and cruise control and I followed their fast pace for a while.

I got to St. John's ledges  right before dark and a good thing at that!! That was one steep downhill!

I rolled out my bed roll and said to a section hiker it was in there that I might be  staying but I wasn't sure. Then it really began to pour. I had 10 miles in and I saw no reason to get soaked. I took out my stove made coffee and ate lunch. In three hours I was eating dinner. It was a great time.  Sleeves and wildflower also joined us for the night. It was a good night to be in a shelter because it rained a lot. Not exactly setting the world on fire with my mileage the past two days but will make up for it.  I forgot to mention I ran into a couple of guys named Jake and Mike who are pictured.

The weather was cold in the forecast was for rain. I got out and got a good start making the dissent of bear mountain. It was not  nearly as deep as Saint johns ledges but it was steep. Then I ascended race mountain. Boy was it foggy and misty. What a shame I couldn't see any of the views. And it was cold cold . After that I sent and decent I still had Mount Everett.

It's not like I'm afraid of them I just don't like them.

I lay down next to the fire and they made room for me in the shelter. It was nice to talk to them. They had just graduated from heist  hi school. We shared some nice time together.

I was sweating profusely as this  humidity was high and it was warm. I kept up with him and I'm sure I slowed him down a bit but we talked. He just graduated civil engineering and I am an electrical engineer. He had also lost his hiking buddy  Maple sera up to shinsplints. Before we knew it we had somebody at Killington summitted Killington.So we pretty much tore it up and I covered the 14 miles before 4:00 PM.   Milestones today include climbing Mount Killington the first 4000 footer sense Virginia, reaching the less than 500 miles to complete point, i'm crossing the 1700 miles completed point. Not bad, not bad at all.  I arrived at the campground state park knowing I needed to shower and to wash my clothing. I also needed stove gas. The shower was operated by quarters so I got quarters from the ranger station and  found out where I could buy stove gas. So I go down to the road to get gas to walk to get gas and how do I say but bear who do I see but there but bear bear.  He gave me a lift to the outfitter which of course I appreciate it. I bought stove gas and soap in the Powerade and a power aid. Damn this program sucks. Anyway I decided I was  going to tent in the state park so I paid my fee got a campsite and went to the bathhouse. I washed all my socks my shorts and my hiking shirt in the sink with good soap and rinsed it multiple times  another words I hand wash my clothes. I squeeze them out thoroughly and got in the shower. I scrub my body and when I got out I just drip dry. I had a pair of boxers in my town shirt  to wear. I was also wearing my slippers. I hung my clothes on the volleyball net but the sun is not shining. I sure hope they dry tonight. At least they're clean and I'm clean . I managed to talk to three of my kids being Father's Day. I left a message for my dad he was in home wasn't home. Anyway it was another low mile day but I'm getting ready to go into the whites and I am  just off trail so I can make a good start tomorrow and hopefully have a good mile day. I do appreciate the left and I appreciate all you've people follow me. 
By the way, it's Father's Day. Happy Father's Day dad. Happy Father's Day Billy Jake and Matt my three sons who are fathers. Being a father has been the greatest experience of my life.

Then as I was approaching the first shelter I heard some very interesting thunder. It came from way high up in the atmosphere and the color of the sky got really strange. I decided it was a prudent move to duck into the  shelter.  It was a good move on my part. The rain began right after I got some water and I stayed dry as it intensified. Pretty soon the rain was torrential.  I was joined in the shelter with some section hikers who have done the trail from Springer all the way up to where I am over the course of several years or many years. The trail names are Bluefeather and Daisy.  It was nice to chat with them while the rain came down. I kept hoping it would stop in at one point I almost left but the rain kept coming in buckets. Eventually I roll down my sleeping bag and settled in.  Not the kind of miles I had in mind. I was shooting for the look out for the next shelter. I guess someone had other plans. Oh well. I guess I should mention that I still haven't had a zero  and that the miles today we're not quite my lovely smile day lowest mile day. I don't know how that came up lovely smile day.

Some great views up there. I also chatted with  Van grizzle who knew some of my old Trail bodies like Sequoia and laser snake. And make flurry Mc flurry.

I'm telling you it was a lot of work. I came in  using my headlamp again. It was a gorgeous day I met some nice people from New Zealand I just kept taking every peak is named after the guy who dropped up the idea of the Appalachian Trail there were some very nice views.  All in all it was an excellent hiking day and except for late attack of some no Siems know see them's it was nice day. No wind no rain few bugs . I'm pushing on towards the end. It's kind a like life, do you want it to be over but you don't want it to be over.

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571981,"So Today was an interesting day and a good day.   For some reason I woke up early and it rained all night and it was still raining. I was 3.6 miles from the ferry across the Kenny bunk river in the car. So instead of waiting as I normally would for the rain to stop I got up and was on the track  on the trail at 7:30. I was hiking with blue suit and we arrived at the ferry landing and to our dismay it was a line of about 12 hikers. When we got up closer we could see that it was a bunch of high school kids like a camp.  The rain was cold and the standing there pretty soon we were all shivering. Sherry was a canoe operated by a woman and with the signing of releases and everything else it took quite a while while to ferry two passengers across. I want point one of the kids started puking right next to the trail right where we were which is very worrisome . I asked the counselor what was wrong with him and he said he had a 24 hour virus at which point I asked the counselor if he would mind if my body and I got on the next ferry because we didn't want to get sick being around these kids who are evidently had all had this 24 hour virus. He reluctantly agreed and then later asked of two kids could go in front of us which week you said sure it was a little tense  but large groups are supposed to call ahead so that a second can I was available and these guys had failed to do that. Anyway we got ferried into Kenny bunk I'm sorry Carotauk and by the time we got across we were actually close to being hyperthermic. Blue suit had the idea that he was going to hit into a town that was  12 miles away while I had it into Carotauk looking for the B&B. When I got there and got to the front desk the guy recognized my condition immediately and ordered me to go get a shower to warm up. His name is Paul and the guys excellent. I got a hot shower and start to feel better put on some dry clothes and his assistant Boulder  shadowed me over to the Sterling in where my package wise. Thanks Jake for shipping that stuff out I got three cigars and a bunch of food here and Carotauk I'm so happy! So I went back to the B&B in Carotauk had some excellent coffee an excellent vanilla milkshake and two excellent pulled pork sandwich  sandwiches. The rain stopped I put on some dry clothes in at 2:30 I reluctantly said goodbye not only to Paul in Boulder but to my friends cheese and Kiote and froggy who had arrived. I probably won't see them again which is sad and away. how do I went not sure how far I was going to go and I ended up doing a long hike till 10:15 PM to make it to shelters a long day in two parts but it set me up to make a 22 mile run for Monson tomorrow. Wish me luck.

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572048,what can I say? I hiked all day. And I hoped up Moxie mountain  and the rest of it I don't really know how to describe. It was up and down along the creek and river it was a long day. I did have to for three Rivers today I had to forward three rivers ford three Rivers.  Yeah I took the program a while to understand that. The one I was able to stone hop. The other two I was forced to take off my shoes and socks and wait through the water wade through the water. Yeah that's fording   Anyway I didn't start particularly early around quarter till 10 and I finished around 830. I'm looking forward to a good nights sleep in a bed and I'm not looking forward to another 20 mile day tomorrow. This is wrapping up . I've seen some nice sites in Maine New Hampshire Vermont Massachusetts Connecticut New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Maryland West Virginia Virginia North Carolina  and Georgia. Wow!

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572161,I had a great stay at Shaws. The breakfast eggs bacon home fries and all you can eat blueberry pancakes plus orange juice and coffee hit the spot. I had my laundry done and my back fluffed my bag fluffed. I packed up my gear and got out on the second train . I guess I hit the trail around 11 AM. I hiked out to the first shelf there and chatted with some ladies that were there. I know I had to forward some streams and I had to cover 15 miles so I got going. Blue suit caught up with me and we had three River  two Ford. The first one was a easy rock Skip but the second one required me to take my shoes off. I can tell you I had trouble forwarding this river forwarding anyway. I must've slipped off a big rock  and into a deep hole. I almost lost my balance and I certainly reach the other side with very very sore feet. The other thing I've neglected to mention was that my Merrills my third pair how to split that light water in. Poet who owns Shawn  Shaws had another pair that was left there by a sponsored hiker. They were Adidas and I tried them on. They felt good. I decided to wear them and to carry my old ones. Considering I had six or seven days of food and an extra pair of shoes my pack was quite happy  heavy not happy. Anyway after 2 miles of hiking I realize these shoes the Adidas we're going to work well. I met a southbound hiker coming out of the wilderness and he was out of food. I offered him some of my trail mix which was heavy on the Eminem's M  and M's and it he happily took some of it. He also agreed to carry my old Merrills back and trash them at Shaws saving me carrying them for the next 100 miles. It was a little risky but I'm confident it was the right choice. One thing you learn is that you live by your own decisions. Anyway after crossing the Ford blue suit hike to head and I continued coming in around 8:30 PM not having to use my headlamp for a change. Huge milestone! I now have less than 100 miles till I summit Catan Katahdin and complete a northbound through hike the Appalachian Trail! I can't wait to finish!!,"Monson, ME Shaws Lodging

Will-da-beast,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572484,so I had a lot of trouble hiking today. It took me until after dark to complete my 15 miles. The mountains didn't help but I knew something was wrong. I pitch my tent before the Ford of the river at a campsite and made my dinner even though I wasn't very hungry . After eating dinner I knew something was really wrong my stomach kept churning churning. I didn't sleep well and I woke up and went out to do my morning business and when I came back I lost last nights dinner next to my  tent. We can shaky weak and shaky I proceeded to pack up and I slowly hiked 5 miles to the next shelter where I collapsed and slept for several hours. I woke up not hungry at all knowing that I needed to hike some more miles. I had a mountain chain to finish with four peaks and I got up at around 4 PM and I hiked the mountains finishing at 8:30 and making it to the shelter. What a day!,"Long Pond Stream Lean-to

I woke up at 4 AM got my coffee actually green tea on and made my oatmeal I was going to need a lot of energy. A quick ate my food pack my things up and started walking. I was rewarded with my early morning  Adventure by saying the most crashing through the woods and also I saw to Autre playing in the lake. It was the first time I had seen Autre in the wild. Then I found myself making excellent time I was hiking well I felt good. I reached a point called rainbow ledges where you hadn't  where you had an excellent view of Catan Katahdin. So I came incentive to hike on and before I knew it I was coming out of the hundred mile wilderness and crossing a bridge called able bridge. Able bridge a while. Abol bridge there we got it. It was very cool spot where they were ran river rafting and they had a camp store and I made the mistake of going into the restaurant where I ate a huge bowl of clam chowder and a sausage sandwich totally destroyed my guts guts. I also saw purge with you who I hadn't seen since Harpers Ferry ! It was great to see him and I also ran into Turk. It was clear that we were coming to the end of this long long journey. Everyone had eaten too much just laying around trying to get themselves together to hike on the 9 miles to the purchase because basically the base camp for Katahdin summit.  I hiked out with my stomach way too full because I also had a ice cream before I left something I rarely do unfortunately my stomach was so upset that I depleted my toilet paper supply on the way to the next shelter. Yes I was pretty sick.  I signed in for the birches Adelaide little kiosk that they had and I was number 11 of 12.

Katahdin summit.  I left the camp noticing that everyone else had already left and it was 7 AM I went to the ranger station and got rid of the extra food I had in my bag in the ranger station was for perch was there with his group karaoke chocolate rain in the squash and I got the OK to proceed so I started hiking  from Catan Springs Campground Katahdin spring campground to summit. I got only a little while before it started getting very steep. Let me just say that the hike to the top of Katahdin what's the toughest climb I've had on this whole hike. I was passing a lot of people but eventually purging his group caught up to me and they passed me on what I consider a blue blaze but it was very steep and difficult to follow the places and we all perceive it up towards what is known as the gate which is where the steep incline of the mountain face finally gives way to a flatter plateau. I don't know how long it took. It was a tough climb and they were places where you were totally exposed hanging onto rebar with Cliff faces below you. The views work incredible the views were incredible. I was enjoying myself however I was the only one caring a four pack  carrying a four pack for pack for FULL pack and the others were carrying a slack pack slack pack more on that later. Anyway before I knew it I was at the gate where it flattened out and you  could see the summit. Then it was a nice walk over boulders which took some time passed throw spring and or a mile from the summit. Scaling rocks coming up towards the summit I could see the celebrations going on. Before I knew it I was up there  and it was my turn! I got up on the platform after giving parch my phone purge my phone I need to collect some pictures of me while I was up top clicked some pictures. What can I say ex?  It was an awesome experience.
