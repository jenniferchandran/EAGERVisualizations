Kickatree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514887,"So...after 20 years I want to try the AT again. A lot of things went wrong back then in 1996, but I have figured out and rehabilitated since then. I learned that a working thyroid is worth a bazillian snickers bars, but what I learned the most is that if the body is not at 100%...you are not going to make it. I had a real hard time back then. I had no clue that I was sick. All I thought about was the next shelter. After 320 miles, I finally realized that something was wrong with me...I got off the trail. Smart move. I decided to to get on with my life after that adventure. I did well. The trail taught me allot about stick to it-avnous. Thank God I did it when I did. It was just what I needed to keep me going.Now 20 years later, I am yearning to return to the AT and enjoy the experience. My thyroid is great, I am 20 pounds lighter, my backpack is a fucking ton lighter. ehehehehe. I want to get some more of what the trail offers. People snobbishly retort that you will ultimately find that you are the same person you were when you started the AT so going out to find yourself is a waste. I disagree. When a man is looking for answers to life's questions, he needs space to do so. The AT is exactly that!!!!! SPACE!!!!. I will be 59 years old while on the AT. Monumental considering I never expected to live that long, but what I hope to gain from this hike is insight! People cannot just stop growing and expect to thrive. I really want to thrive. To accomplish my goals, I need to test myself daily. grow, learn new concepts, mix with the young, enjoy who I am, and profoundly appreciate our natural habitat. How the fuck else will I be able to be a productive old fart and sage. If anyone were to ask me why I am doing this, I would just say that it is necessary.",,What the Hell,"Aug 04, Tue",0
Kickatree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553026,"It's just started to feel like Winter here in NW Florida. I stood outside last night in my stocking feet and a fleece sweater. Wind was howling and it was raining lightly. Just keeping it real. Cold feels differently to different folks, but cold feels intense when just stepping out into it from a warm home. To anyone who sits at home reading the journals, my journal and reads about how cold it is should understand that adversity is what makes us alive in the woods. Please cheer us on!",,The Inner Me,"Jan 07, Sat",0
Kickatree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553027,"I won't be hiking alone in the beginning. A friend of mine is rehabbing her left knee and is chomping at the bit to get some miles. So she will be hiking the start up to Dicks Creek Gap, then again from Damascus through VA (if all time off details go well.)
I am very glad to have her along. She is an excellent hiker and loves the big miles. I just hope I can keep up with her. 
AT Thru-hike is a link to my geargram page. It'll show you what I plan to carry.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Sun",0
