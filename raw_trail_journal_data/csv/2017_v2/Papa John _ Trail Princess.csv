Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551131,"We've just returned from living 4 years in Spain - Madrid to be precise. What a great experience. We decided to try the whole city living things so we never owned a car there and rarely rented one. Papa John walked to work every day and Trail Princess walked to the gym. We generally walked to restaurants and other places we visited throughout the week. So in a way, we'd say this was the beginning of our training because we averaged at least 3.5 miles of walking per day for those 4 years.",,Spain!,"Oct 03, Wed",3.50
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551132,"While back in the US during our time in Spain, we tried to work in a few hikes to start more realistic training for the AT. This time we did the Dockery Lake Trail and then the AT to Preacher's Rock and back. We met some others doing their thru hike training. We are pretty sure one of them was Bombadil, who we followed during his thru hike attempt this year. And so close to completion - we really felt bad that his knee just didn't allow the last 80 miles. We're later 50s in age so obviously we worry about having a similar fate, although I think we'd still feel it was a success to go that far.",,The AC in the car!,"Aug 01, Sat",10.60
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551133,"One of our daughters was visiting so we drove up to North Georgia to do the Panther Creek Trail. Kristen's an officer in the Navy and very fit so she made it look easy compared to Papa John and Trail Princess. She once did a 40 mile trail run in Virginia with very little practice and finished 2nd in her age group, so she's not really a good test for us to see how we are doing. So we'll say we did just fine! We have three grown children behind us for our hike - so we're lucky. And we'll be trying not to let them down!",,Panther Creek Trail,"Aug 08, Sat",8
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551187,"While visiting our son and one daughter, both of whom currently live in the San Diego area, we decided to climb the Mt Woodson trail with our daughter Kristen. We had done it before with our son Matt, be he nor his wife could make it this time. The trail is heavily trafficked but still a lot of fun. Always a great day when you can enjoy the outdoors with your family.",,Potato Chip rock,"Mar 20, Sun",6.90
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551188,"While in the San Diego area, our son also recommended the Three Sisters Waterfalls Trail. What he didn't do was warn us how difficult it was! The trail is in a beautiful desert environment, but is rocky and very steep in some places. There are 3 or 4 parts where they have ropes because it would be nearly impossible to go up or down without them. Have to say it was a good workout and we're glad we didn't have our packs. Probably nothing like the White Mountains, but we should be in better hiking shape by the time we make it to New Hampshire. After the hike, we recuperated by visiting nearby Julian, CA, which is famous for their apple pies. Hmmmm, the health benefits of this hike probably didn't last too long.",,The falls,"Mar 23, Wed",3.90
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551189,"We've left Spain and are living back in Georgia now and we're getting more serious about our AT preparation. We've got all of our gear now so are starting to train with our packs at least 1-2 days a week when we are traveling on business or to see our new granddaughter. This day we decided to hike the Kennesaw Mountain Loop Trail. It's a nice hike with a bit of civil war history along the way. We also frequent the Big Creek and Vickery Creek trails in Roswell, both of which have at least some elevation changes.",,Kennesaw Mountain,"Aug 13, Sat",5.80
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551191,Made it out for an early evening hike of the Vickery Creek trail this day and met a new friend - a nice 6 point buck trying to camouflage himself just a few feet away in the trees.,,Vickery Creek,"Aug 14, Sun",4.70
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551203,"We decided to go to the Georgia mountains and do the loop trail at Slaughter Creek that has a section on the AT. Despite the rain, the trail was pretty active on this Sunday. The rain was actually nice because it kept the temperature down. It also helped to prove that Trail Princess could actually survive with wet hair. She actually did very well. This was a breakthrough!",,Slaughter Creek Trail,"Aug 28, Sun",5.70
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551335,"Time for our first and only overnight training hike. We want to be sure and test some of the gear we can't test on day hikes and get used to the routine. So with our full gear load for the AT, except not as much food, we headed off to do the AT Approach Trail from the Amicalola Lodge to Springer Mountain. To make up for the lack of food and just to help her conditioning, Papa John did manage to slip a 4 lbs weight into Trail Princess's backpack. She wasn't too happy when she figured this out at Springer Mountain! We were accompanied by our friends and next door neighbors, Lisa and Sean, for the first half of the hike. Those 600 stairs going up to the top of the falls are tough with the extra weight of the pack. But we made it all the way to the Springer Mountain campsite in plenty of time. With the Georgia drought, we only found one water source and it was basically just a small 3-4 inch deep spring fed puddle. The filter worked great and the water tasted great! Trail Princess was cold by the time we set up camp so we crawled in our bags and fell asleep by 7.30pm. Its been a long time since we've done that. It got down to 40 degrees that night but our new Nemo sleeping bags worked great. We woke up once around 1.30am for a pit stop. We lingered a few minutes outside afterwards to enjoy the gorgeous skies.",,Springer Moutain campsite,"Nov 05, Sat",8.80
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551336,"We got up around 7am and broke camp. It probably took longer than it should have but it was good practice and that's why we did this overnight. We did test out the Jetboil stove and it had 1.5 cups of water boiling within a couple of minutes for the first of what no doubt will be a lot of instant oatmeal over the next year. We wanted to try and make good time so set a goal of finishing the hike back to the Amicalola Falls State Park visitor center, loading the gear into the car, and making it to a ""rewards"" Sunday brunch at the Lodge before they closed. We made it in plenty of time and enjoyed the food. The views would have been great, but were spoiled by the smoke from fires burning further north in Georgia and North Carolina.",,Amicalola Lodge restaurant,"Nov 06, Sun",8.80
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551964,Was lucky enough to see our youngest daughter this weekend while she was visiting from North Carolina. She was excited to go out on a hike with us but we were a bit short on time so just went and did the Jones Bridge Trail near our house. We carried the packs so we'd get at least a little benefit from this easy but scenic trail. But the best part was just being together.,,Jones Bridge Trail,"Nov 20, Sun",4.30
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552143,"Thought we'd share this with everyone - we thought it was funny. About a year ago when we went to get fitted for our packs, our youngest daughter came along. It turns out that she too a picture while we were being fitted and SnapChatted it to our other daughter, with a few captions and graphics added. Luckily our other daughter kept a copy and sent it to us a few months ago. Also, lucky for Papa John, Trail Princess's attitude about this adventure has evolved a lot - for the better!",,REI,"Dec 05, Mon",0
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552828,"Well, between work, lots of rain (finally) in Georgia, and the holidays, our training has suffered. But one way or another, we'll be ready for starting our thru-hike in mid-March. We went to California to see our children and granddaughter for Christmas. Even there, there was quite a bit of rain. Maybe that's a hint about what's to come! Anyway, we did find a day to get out and do a short hike with our son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter (and their 4-legged boys). It was a really pretty hike and nice to get out again.",,Elfin Forest Olivenhain Trail,"Dec 27, Tue",4.50
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553418,"March, the start of our adventure, is coming up really fast! And the Atlanta area has been unseasonably warm, so it's been a great opportunity to get in some practice hikes. Today we hiked up Stone Mountain. Stone Mountain is a quartz dome and the site of Stone Mountain Park in Stone Mountain, Georgia. At its summit, the elevation is 1,686 feet above sea level and 825 feet above the surrounding area. Stone Mountain is well-known not only for its geology, but also for the enormous rock relief on its north face, the largest bas-relief in the world. The carving depicts three Confederate figures during the Civil War: Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, and Jefferson Davis. The top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock pools, and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of downtown Atlanta, often Kennesaw Mountain, and on very clear days even the Appalachian Mountains. Today was one of those cleaar days, so we could see our future trail home. Only two months now!",,Stone Mountain,"Jan 13, Fri",4
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553419,"Today we drove over to our old stomping grounds in Marietta and hiked the Sope Creek Trail. Before we moved to Spain a few years ago, we needed to move into an apartment for a few months after we sold the house since Papa John's Spanish work permit was still being processed. There was an entry to this train from our apartment complex so we hiked it all the time. It was nice to go back. It's a pretty trail with a very nice rocky creek down below, a small family cemetery hidden i the woods from the 1800s, and large ruins from an old mill along the river.",,Sope Creek Trail Ruins,"Jan 15, Sun",4.90
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555110,"Well, our practice is done. Trail Princess is in California visting our 5 month old granddaughter (pictured) one last time before we leave and Papa John just landed in the Maldives on business. It isn't as glamorous as it sounds though. The Maldives is nearly 1200 beautiful islands but Papa John wont be here long enough to enjoy them and is stuck in a secluded area near the airport. Oh well - maybe another time!
So we hope to start our adventure 2 weeks from today! Since we only made it out for one overnight and want to get quicker at setting up the tent before we get rained on, we may leave a day or two later so that we can be sure we get 2-3 days of decent weather when we first start.
When Papa John and Trail Princess get home from their trips, they'll only have a couple of days for last minute preparation. Take our cat Oreo to Aunt Debra's since she and David are being so kind to keep him. Stop the mail. Buy the last of the food for the first few days of our adventure. And get a massage (thanks Jacki and Jim). 
We'll leave you with a copy of a Facebook post from Trail Princess's sister. It'll provide you with some insight into Trail Princess's trail name!
""My sister is the biggest diva. Always has been. She hates being cold, so she would make our bathroom a sweat factory. She hates bugs. She hates being too hot. Before we had central air in our house, she would make me (8 years younger) put ice in a washcloth on her back. She hates the rain because it ""makes her hair frizzy."" She loves her Starbucks, luxury hotels with bathrobes and eating out at restaurants and fancy hair products and make-up. Which is why I am giving a HUGE shout out to my big Sis for her adventure in 2 1/2 weeks. My sister, diva extraordinaire, and her husband will be hiking the ENTIRE Appalachian Trail, from Georgia to Maine. Six months!! And while there may be some doubters that she can do it, I know she will. Because she may be prissy, but she's also fierce as Hell and never quits. I'm so proud, envious and amazed! And, I'm honored to have bestowed upon her, her trail name. She will be known, fittingly, as Trail Princess. And, she will be a total bad-ass.""",,Nowhere,"Feb 25, Sat",0
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555975,"Well, the time has come. One more day of work tomorrow and then the sabbatical starts for Papa John. We want to start on a day when there won't be precipitation for at least 2-3 days because we were only able to do one overnight practice and want some extra time to ensure we can work together to get the tent setup quickly if it rains (I guess we should say WHEN it rains!). Sunday looks like the day. It will rain and snow a bit overnight, but then clear by mid morning. The week looks pretty cold at night so we'll get to test our sleeping bags and layers of clothes! 
Our neighbors are kind enough to give us a ride to the trail that day. And Trail Princess's aunt is the best for agreeing to keep our cat. We'll take him to their house tonight. 
Excited? Yes! Nervous? Yes! But it's time to go! See ya on the trail.",,Springer Mountain,"Mar 09, Thu",0
Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556219,"Well, we ended up starting today instead of tomorrow in order to get some mileage in before some forecasted bad weather hit. Otherwise we were looking at about a week's delay. Our neighbors brought us up to the FS42 parking lot and back hiked the mile to the Southern Terminus with us for the photo ops. We then got officially started around 0930. By 3:30 the freezing rain started and we decided to stop for the day and set up the camp at a stealth campsite just past Hightower Gap. We weren't that good at getting the tent up quickly but it worked out OK and we got on the sleeping bags by 5pm to stay warm for the night.","Springer Mountain

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556347,"Good news! After a night of rain, freezing rain and snow, with a low of 26F, we woke alive, dry and unfrozen. I won't say we were excited to crawl out of our sleeping bags but you know, nature calls! We shook as much of the ice off the tent as we could and packed up. It was a very hard hike up a few smaller hills and then over Sassafras Mountain. Papa John realized that somewhere in the past few years his quadriceps had vanished and what shreds of them remained were cramping up going uphill. Trail Princess had more issues going downhill. Morale was poor but then right when we got to Cooper Gap and pulled off our packs to make some oatmeal, Cool Hand and his son River pulled up in a bread van and started setting up for our first trail magic! They had an awning, propane heaters, hot chairs, hot drinks and snacks. What a boost!!! Cool Hand was a Marine, like our son, a former hiker, and just wants to give back. Very nice guy and with a very polite young son. Cool Hand was clearly setting a great example for him. We did need to keep going eventually. The snow in the trees was melting so the water and ice was coming down on us and it wasn't too pleasant. We got to Gooch Gap shelter and had some lunch. It was early afternoon and it was already almost full due to the weather. We talked to some of the other hikers, enjoyed chicken salad on tortillas and moved on. We eventually stopped at a stealth campsite on top of Ramrock Mountain late in the afternoon. Luckily the sun had just emerged so we laid things out to dry and set up camp. Didn't have much to try and start a fire and with the wet wood, we failed. So we were in the sleeping bags again by 7 to stay warm for the night.","hightower gap

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556350,"Woke up to another 26F morning. At least it was dry. Headed out with just a snack bar for breakfast but when we arrived at Woody Gap we stopped for toilets and used the picnic table to set up the stove and make some warm oatmeal. That really hit the spot. While there, we met Ali and her boyfriend. Ali is 23 and thru-hiking. Her boyfriend hiked the 1st couple of days with her and then had to drive back to PA for work so was dropping her off. We had seen them a couple of times already in the 1st two days. He asked us to keep watch over her. Knowing the bad weather that is coming, with snow and night temperatures around 15F we decided to call ahead and get a room. All we could find was a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins. We made it to Jarrards Gap and got a shuttle to the cabin. We invited Ali to join us. She hiked the remaining 5 miles over Blood Mountain and then met us at the cabin for the night.","Ramrock Mountain

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556480,"Today we stayed warm with Kathy and June from Florida. Two very nice ladies who let us stay with them in their cabin. They come here often during this season and help the hikers. They were here 3 days and let hikers stay each night. So nice! We rode with them to take some things to the hikers that stayed with them the previous night. They were Second Chance and Back Again from Luxembourg. They were either brave or crazy because the weather was awful and they went out into it. It was below freezing, snowing and winds of 35mph. Then we had much with Kathy and June in Blairsville and headed back to the cabin for the night and worked on a puzzle. Made me think of my dad. He loves puzzles.","Blood Mountain Cabins

After the 0.3 mile hike from where they dropped us to the AT, we continued our journey. It was 19F outside and breezy. The trail was covered with 2-3 inches of snow but it wasn't icy going up. It really wasn't a bad trek up even though Blood Mountain is the highest point of the AT in Georgia. The view from the top was great today. We met Sparks and Bushy at Blood Mountain Cabin at the top. They are thru-hiking as well. Then we headed down. Downhill was treacherous in spots due to ice. Papa John sat on his rear once but otherwise both he and Trail Princess survived the downhilll and made it back to Blood Mountain Cabins for the night.","Jarrard Gap

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556746,"Today was our longest day yet. After a great stay through the worst of the weather at Blood Mountain Cabins, we hiked the .3 miles back to the trail and headed north. The first climb was the worst. The 17F weather didn't help but at least it was warming. After the climb the trail followed ridges for a while so the ups and downs were not extreme. After 5.5 miles we descended into Tesnatee Gap where the Bethlehem Ga United Methodist Church was doing trail magic, served by King Tut and Jim. The snacks and drinks were great but perhaps the best were the hand knitted hats that they gave us. But then it was off for a few more miles to Low Gap shelter where we camped for the night. Although exhausted, we hung out with a group and built a fire to stay warm before going to bed. Trail Princess didn't sleep too well.","Neal's Gap

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556750,"It was a good bit warmer today starting around freezing. However, the hills were killers with large ups and downs and several of them. We set sight on the Cheese Factory site for the night and pulled it off despite it being really hard. Tomorrow WILL be a shorter day. The best part of the day was another trail magic site at Unicoi Gap. Another local church had lots of people there serving pulled pork sandwiches, snacks and drinks and also offering first aid items to those who needed them. Fortunately we didn't. We then went on to our camp for the night after 2 long steep hills. By the way, a lot of you have sent us messages of encouragement. We want you to know that we are receiving them and appreciate the suppprt. It does a help!","Low Gap Shelter

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556927,"We woke in the rain and fog today. At least it wasn't as cold. It was the first morning with temperatures above freezing since our first night on the trail. We packed up and headed out with an immediate 800' climb over one mile of trail. Welcome to Saturday! It wasn't long before we realized it was going to be a tough day and we were hitting a wall. As we approached Addis Gap, we considered stopping and camping for the night rather than going on to Low Gap as we had planned. The problem was that continuing the extra 2 miles meant an 825' climb up Kelly Knob followed by a 575' decent. And we were already dead. So we stopped and had chicken salad on a tortilla and then Trail Princess says - let's do it. So we did. That allowed us to keep up with the group of younger hikers we had been with, although some had stopped for the previous night and one dropped out. Fire Starter built a good fire and everyone huddled around it for a couple of hours to stay warm.","Cheese Factory.

For those who don't know, a Nearo is a short day of hiking - not quite a Zero, which would be no hiking. We hiked to the top of Powell Mountain to get phone reception and reserved a room at the Holiday Inn Express in Hiawassee, GA. Then we hiked down into Dick's Creek Gap and stuck our thumbs out for a ride to town. Bryann and her mom Dale stopped and picked us up. They are from Michigan and here for Bryann to start a thru-hike with her mom joining her for the first week. We really appreciated the ride. Our day in the HI Express has been great.

It was our 2nd highest mileage so far and we caught back up to the group we hiked with early on.

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557323,"We awoke to a dirty tent. We had some pretty good thunderstorms during the night and the rain hitting the ground had splattered mud all over our tent. The temperature was around freezing and getting camp broken down wasn't pleasant. Everyone out here seems to be looking forward to some warmer weather. After a breakfast bar and some hot chocolate, we headed off trying to reach Rock Gap shelter 12 miles away. The sun came out today without clouds or fog so at least it seemed to be warming quickly and eventually became a pleasant day. Before too long we arrived at a place where several people had stopped to admire the view. It seemed to be an unnamed place on the trail but had a beautiful view to the south and east. It was there that we met an older gentleman who had passed us a half mile of so earlier. He goes by The Greybeard Adventurer and is trying to set the record for oldest person to thru-hike the AT. He is 82 years old. We passed each other several more times during the day. If he stays healthy, we think he can do it. What an inspiration! Later, we got to the gap just before Albert Mountain. The next part looked straight up, and it was. Getting up Albert Mountain was mostly a rock climb. It was treaturous and exhausting, but luckily not too high. At the top was an old fire tower and the views were incredible. We stopped there for a much of pepperoni slices and cheese. We made good time today and Papa John devised a plan to pass the shelter and get a ride to a hiker hotel in Franklin, NC so we could clean our gear (and ourselves). With no protest from Trail Princes, we made it work. It turned out to be one of our easiest days on the Trail so far as the hills were not to steep and our bodies were a bit more cooperative.","Carter Gap shelter

The Budget Inn is really here just for hikers. It is better than a tent! Not much else to say about it. Last night for dinner we wandered around at 7pm and everything was closed. We finally found a place attached to a gas station and it had a long line outside. Good sign. And great food. Seems the owner / chef used to be a chef at the Greenbriar Resort and decided to open his own place here in Frankilin. It is widely written up and their theme is great food for normal people. What a gem. We went back today for early dinner. Many of you now track your daily steps with your phone or Fitbit. We did. We seem to be averaging about 30,000 steps per day, even counting our slow days. Of course that is with 26-37 lbs on our back. We are averaging about 8.5 miles per day which is pretty good at this point. That will increase as time goes on if all is well.","Rock Gap

Today has been the most painful day thus far for both Papa John and Trail Princess. Both of our feet are killing us today. They feel really bruised. Trail Princess' knees are also bad and Papa John got a shin splint on his left leg today. We did OK for the first half of the day but that last couple of miles into Wayah Bald shelter to camp was really slow. We each had a vitamin I before bedtime. Vitamin I is really Ibuprofin. It really helps knock down the swelling and makes things feel better. After a meal of Macaroni and Cheese with bacon bits, we hung the bear bag and headed to bed at hiker midnight.

We got up a little later, made some oatmeal and Carnation Instant Breakfast and had some tea with it. Oh, and a dose of vitamin I! Then we broke camp and headed onto the trail. It seemed a lot better today. Our feet were pretty good for most of the day and Trail Princess's knees were not as bad. Papa John's shin splints were also much better and not even noticeable by later on the day. The foot pain did return but only for the last couple of miles. We had a nice break at Burningtown Gap because a local Baptist Church had set-up trail magic. We had vegatable beef soup, chili, cornbread, and cookies, along with Gatorade. It was a welcome surprise since we normally hate gaps. Going down into a gap is the hardest part on the feet and knees. And it is always a steep climb back to the top of a mountain or ridge after the gaps. We eventually made it to Weser Bald shelter where we planned to camp but it was overcrowded and there were no level places to stay. So we headed further down the trail looking for some level ground to use as a stealth camp. After about 3/4 mile we found a small spot in a saddle and set up camp. Tomorrow will be all downhill into the Nantahala Outdoor Center where we were able to reserve a room for the night. Fittingly, Trail Princess has decided that although OK with hiking, she doesn't like camping. So we will be getting more rooms than planned along the way - when possible.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Tomorrow will be tough with a 3000' climb over the first 7 miles. We got some special tape from Rosebud & Thorn (previous thru-hikers). We will try it on Trail Princess's knees to see if it helps her patella tendon.

It is a 19% grade for those who know about such things. Knowing about that made it mentally hard to get started today. We planned to go to Cable Gap shelter if we could so that we could have a shorter day on Wednesday into Fontana Dam, the entry to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The first half of our day was hard. Jacob's ladder was as advertised and there were a number of smaller climbs. Luckily the second half of the day was ridge running and quite a bit easier, so we were able to make it to Cable Gap shelter as planned. That said, we were exhausted. G2 and Speckled Hen made it as well. The evening weather was the best we have had so no rush to bed. We made it until 8pm! But it was a bad night and we keep sliding down to the end of our air mattresses and then crawling back up all night due to uneven ground.

We got there by 11:30am and got into a room for much needed showers. It is hard to believe how bad we smell after just 3 days - and it isn't even summer yet. After showers we had a nice lunch (something other than tuna on a tortilla), went to the laundry, and then the general store. Trail Princess's knees continue to be a big problem so we tried to get knee braces at the general store but they didn't have any small enough. So we have decided to spend a Zero here and have Amazon deliver some tomorrow. The Smokies will be hard and we need to give Trail Princess some relief for the knees.

Hopefully that will be the case as we start through the Smokies tomorrow. This morning we got a ride to the Fontana Dam and back-tracked to the crossing where we got off the trail yesterday. That will allow us to start at the dam in the morning and save us 1.6 miles. In the Smokies, you have to stay at shelter sites as there is no stealth camping allowed. So we will be shooting for a shelter that is 11 miles away with almost 3000' of uphill climb. It won't be an easy day but we hear it isn't nearly as steep as Jacob's Ladder was.

From the first step we were both sluggish. We had on the full rain suits - coats and pants - and were slogging through the mud. The day just didn't start well. Before long, here was the conversation. Could it be any more miserable? Well yes, actually it could be. What if the wind were higher , temperature lower, and rain harder. Well I think this is really miserable. OK dear, if that's what you think. Now you can figure out for yourselves which lines were from Trail Princess and which were from Papa John. If you need it, here is a hint. Consider our trail names! Anyway, by afternoon the weather was improving and the sun came out. It was really quite nice but by then we were both dead.

Along the way, the damage from last year's fire was everywhere with many buildings and businesses burned to the ground. Really sad. Even a motel where Papa John and Trail Princess stayed right after they got married was burned to the ground. We met many familiar faces at the laundromat and also at the grocery store afterwords.

After a few miles we came to Charlie's Bunion. We had seen it during our shuttle ride back to Newfound Gap. It is a big rock formation hanging off the side of a mountain. You can take a side trail for 0.3 miles off the AT to stand atop the rocks for photos but we had seen the same view a 1/2 mile or so earlier so opted not to do the extra hiking just to stand on some rocks!

Neither of us was really in the mood today but we kept grinding it out. About 2/3 of the way into the day, we had to tackle Max Patch. Max Patch is a homonym for Mack's Patch. Apparently Mack thought that clearing the top of a mountain over 4500' tall and turning it into a pasture for his cattle was a good idea. We prefer the plains of Texas or Kansas. We are thinking Mack didn't go to school! Anyway, it was a very, very hard day - at least up to the top of Max Patch. The views were good there but the wind was blowing so hard Papa John was literally seeing double. They were around 50 mph. If Trail Princess didn't have the weight of her backpack, she may have been blown away. Damn backpack. Just kidding! Coming down Max Patch was totally different - fortunately. The trail wasn't steep and was a bit easier despite the mud. And the mountain behind us blocked most of the wind. We made it to our planned shelter. We were freezing and felt almost dead.

Two of them were barely visible in the fog but one was directly on the trail and we were able to watch him from a few feet away. Although we brought an apple, we didn't feed him. Instead we went into the state park hoping to see more. We didn't. We had a break in the weather and set up our tent just after leaving the park. Then the rain came. Yuk!","Campsite

Pretty quickly we saw signs of ponies, although none were in sight. But before long we spotted one on a hillside that looked to be where we were headed. It ended up being two ponies - a mother and a newborn (probably 2-3 days old). And they were directly on the trail. We approached carefully and they didn't seem scared. We sliced off a piece of our apple and momma enjoyed that. We were able to pet her and she seemed to enjoy it. We could get very close to the newborn, but didn't try to touch it. The rest of the day was good, other than lots more rock. At the end of the day we came across a big snake (5 feet or more) and it was heavier than the last. Papa John knew it wasn't venomous and carefully passed a couple of feet away but Trail Princess wouldn't go that close and there wasn't room to go elsewhere. Papa John tried to prod the snake with his hiking pole and that caused it to rattle its tail like an a rattlesnake. That is a trait of Rat snakes, which Is what this was.

Second, when we got to the Settler's Museum, the West End United Methodist Church had set up a great trail magic in the old one room schoolhouse. Papa John remembers visiting a similar schoolhouse in Romeoville, Illinois when he was a child. His father attended it when he was young. This one was closed in 1937. We took pictures there not only of the schoolhouse, but also with Ruby Cosmos and Foxy Shazam, who we have hiked back and forth with for a few weeks. Not too long after the trail magic, we had to cross I-81. There was a gas station there with a Mexican restaurant attached. So we stopped for dinner. It was good.

The view from there showed what appeared to be a very flat valley. Geologists say it is actually a very large crater caused eons ago by a limestone collapse. There is only one natural entrance to the crater and there are 2 roads. We spent the next 8 miles following the rim of the crater part way around. The ups and downs were very small but added together, they were very tiring and Virginia continues to be very rocky and hard on the feet.

So if you don't like the side you are on, look forward to another side. And I have learned that after a hard climb, you are often rewarded by the beauty of the summit.

Even when he went in the hospital, he didn't want me to know for fear I would stop my hike. And whenever we spoke, or when he talked to my mom or sister, he wanted to know where I was on the trail.

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577283,"I was on my own today as it was raining and the couple I have hiked with for the past few days decided to zero and stay dry. I am planning to summit Katahdin on the 17th with one of my daughters so I needed to hike on. The rain stopped after about 3 hours and it turned into a decent day. I didn't rush because the trail was slick. Despite that, I fell at least a half dozen times but nothing bad. I hiked until it was nearly dark so that I could be certain to make it to Monson tomorrow. Only 3 climbs of 1000' or more remaining - including Katahdin!!","US-201 Caratunk, Maine

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577284,"Last night was cool. Right at midnight I was awoken by a loud moose call. It happened again a couple of hours later. If you listened closely, you could hear the same call in the far distance and the moose which was near me would answer. Although I never saw the moose, another hiker said he saw a large bull moose near us when he woke. Anyway, the hike today was mostly uneventful except there were 2 river fords that were up to my knees. Tomorrow I will head into the 100 Mile Wilderness for about a week. I may be unable to update the journal during that time. Based upon the last couple of days, I feel fairly confident in my summit date with my daughter on the 17th!","Moxie Bald Mountain lean-to

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577617,"I had a good breakfast today at Pete's Place. It is a small restaurant and store next to the hostel I was in. I had been told that Monson wasn't a good stop. I disagree. It had several restaurants and a couple of decent resupply places in addition to 3-4 places to stay. Anyway, I it back on the trail a little after 7am and hiked until around 4:30pm. I would like to have done another 4 miles to the next shelter but I was tired from the rocks and roots as well as a lot of small ups and downs, so I stopped. When I arrived at a Big Wilson Stream there was an older hiker carefully fording it found southbound. I sat down to take my boots off and when the hiker arrived on my side, I recognized him as Huckleberry. I haven't seen him since Southern Virginia when Trail Princess was still on the trail. We caught up for a few minutes before I did the river ford. Huckleberry had flipped from Massachusetts when he realized he wouldn't make it to Mt Katahdin in time and was now traveling southbound. At the shelter, I have just under 100 miles to go!","ME-15 Monson, Maine

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577619,"I started the day planning for 15.1 miles as a minimum but hoping to go 20.8. My hopes were dashed between the many elevation changes (summiting six named mountains) and the rocks and roots, it took me ten hours with very little break time to cover the 15 miles. If I had gone further, it would have been dark. Despite that, I am on pace to complete the 100 Mile Wilderness in 6 days total so my summit date is not at risk. From an elevation standpoint, tomorrow looks like the last difficult day other than the Katahdin summit with 4 more named Mountains to summit. Today I passed the 2100 mile marker. There won't be any more of those as I have just 84 miles to go","Long Pond Stream Lean-to

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577620,"I expected today to be tough. At the start of the day, I started up the 3000' climb over several mountains in the White Cap range. I was a little worried whether my legs still had enough in them to stay on my plan for the 100 Mile Wilderness. Surprisingly, I made it over the range easier than expected. After White Cap Mountain, the decent was gradual and less rocky, rooty, and muddy than it has been. I have had mostly good and dry weather in this stretch so some of the mud is drying and the rocks and roots aren't as slippery as they can be so I was able to make good time on the decent and get some good miles in today. For dinner I had the 2 1/2 serving size of dehydrated beef stroganoff, a snickers bar, and some strawberry drink mix. It was pretty satisfying and my food bag is getting lighter. I planned six days to get through this stretch but brought 7 days of food. The signs on entry warn you to bring 10 days of food. Luckily I appear to be on plan to do this in 6 days, so I have some safety margin on the food. There is one Hostel that services the 100 Mile Wilderness. I hope to stay there tomorrow. It is on a lake and there is a boat dock near the trail. It had a radio-phone on the dock to call the hostel. Then they send a boat across the lake to get you. The only problem is that I need to do over 20 miles tomorrow to get there. I have set my alarm to wake me early!","Stealth camp

They want you there by 4pm or you can't eat with them and doing over 20 miles by 4pm is tough. I made it at 2:15!  The weather was perfect and so was the trail. It was so nice to have an actual trail again. Sure there are some rocks and roots but nothing bad. Already did my shower and washed my clothes in a tub with lake water using a washboard.

Different people have different views on it. Some are happy. Some are a little sad because they don't know what is next. I am lucky and am going back to work immediately so I am in the happy camp. Today was uneventful. I woke and had a nice breakfast at the hostel and got a bit of a late start at 8:45. I only had 15 miles to do in fairly easy terrain (though not as easy as yesterday), so it was pretty relaxing. I had the first data signal on my phone in 4 days from atop a small mountain, so sat for a while and updated my journal, checked email, and made some phone calls. I also checked the weather and it is looking OK for our summit of Sunday, albeit mostly cloudy.","White House Landing Hostel

But no big deal as I was only going 15 miles and the ""I am about to finish"" adrenaline had kicked in! I didn't rush much in order not to risk injury, but made it out of the 100 Mile Wilderness and into the campground and store by 1:30pm and or ordered a ruben sandwich and a Dr Pepper. Then I set up camp by the river and am laying on a picnic table writing this. WiFi costs money at the store so I will download later when I have dinner. Tomorrow should be an easy 10 mile hike to Katahdin Stream Campground, from where I will get a ride into Millinocket for my zero on Saturday.

Then it was into the trail for what proved to be an easy hike to Katahdin Stream Campground. The trail was nice and without a lot of elevation change. Heading into Millinocket for my zero tomorrow to wait for my daughter to arrive wasn't too hard. Myself and Augusta got a ride from a nice lady to the edge of Baxter State Park and then got a ride from there into Millinocket from a Canadian man and his daughter.

The hostel did a nice hiker feed with BBQ chicken and lots of other good foods while some bands played music in the park across the street. Everyone here is in a good mood!,"Abol Bridge Campground

Papa John & Trail Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577920,"We did it! Today my daughter Kristen and I summited Mt Katahdin. It wasn't supposed to be the prettiest of days but it turned out to be nice and was very special. This was especially true since Kristen could join me. But when I say ""We did it"" I don't just mean Kristen and I. This journey would not have been possible with many of you. 
First, I want to thank Amadeus IT Group, my employer. They have been great and very supportive, especially my boss Paco, our CFO Ana, and our CEO Luis. 
I must thank my immediate family. My wife Trail Princess joined me for 800 miles but had to end her journey due to injury. Having her with me was special. And having her become co-captain of my cheerleading team after she left the trail was important. My daughter Melissa was the other captain. Her enthusiasm for my adventure surprised me but was greatly appreciated and helpful. My daughter Kristen was always supportive and joined Melissa in June to hike with me for 3 days in addition to summiting Mt Katahdin with me. My son Matt was encouraging from a distance. I know he would have loved to join me but he is currently deployed overseas by the military. 
My parents were also very supportive. Unfortunately my father passed away before seeing me finish but I know he would be proud. My sister bore the brunt of my father's health issues as well as needing to help my mother when her home was flooded by hurricane Harvey. And her husband was also key to keeping things going so that I could remain on the trail. 
Trail Princess's family was also instrumental. Whether it was notes of encouragement from her brother, helping with logistics for my daughters joining by her sister, or trail magic by her parents, all things helped to make this possible. 
Finally, there were countless others. Anne, Ricky, Lisa and Shawn all helped to get us to the trail or keep an eye on our home. Many other friends sent notes of encouragement that helped keep me going. And many strangers who read this journal did too. 
So all of you should pat yourselves on the back because - we did it!
Thanks!",,Baxter Peak of Mount Katahdin,"Sep 17, Sun",5.20
