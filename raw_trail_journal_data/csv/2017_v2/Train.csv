Train,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543729,Well I never thought I'd ever be planning this trip. Yet I'm doing it. It's like a dream come true to go and hike the Appalachain Trail. Were starting June 19-2017. Always wanted to since I was a little kid and I can't honestly explain why but most hikers can't explain why they do what they do. what got me started hiking was when my Uncle Tim took me to Linville when I think I was about 10. I think the majority of my family thinks that I'm crazy. But my wife is backing me up and grandma says go and do it. Not just going to be me though my son is going along too. He is is fixing to turn 14 and the years are flying by but he knows that I have been talking about this hike as long as he can remember and he is all in. I'd love to thru hike this trail but at the moment that's just not possible so here's the plan: section hike in 2 week intervals each summer for 3 years and the 4th summer when Hunter graduates were headed out to finish it. Depending on how far we get over the next few seasons I think we will have 1500-1600 miles to finish. Wish us luck. But the next 4 years is going to fly by. I'm going to track our preparations through this journal hopefully once a month till next June,,View Entry,"Jul 27, Wed",0
Train,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544227,"Well I talked to my boss a couple days ago to talk about my trip and the plans I have and the leave I will have to take. The date has been reset for June 16-2017 for the first of three two week section hikes that we are going to go do over the next three years. Our section goal is Springer Mountain Georgia to Clingmans Dome/Newfound Gap North Carolina. It'll be Friday the 16th- Sunday the 2nd. Been packing my pack over and over to get it just right and to get a true actual carrying weight. There's plenty of springs so we're carrying 2 liters of water at a time and 5 days of food. Pack weight is right at 25lbs and that's me being as minimalist as possible. Only carrying the basics food,shelter, water and very few cloths. Been on the treadmill a little but I ain't in bad shape but would like to get down to 190-200. 210 at the moment. LeeAnn surprised me with the guide book. She's a great wife. I said one night that I need this book to help me plan and what showed up the next day and had been overnight from Georgia. She also got me a new set of hikers to get broke in. Planning 35 mile hike in a couple weeks to do a little gear testing ( upgraded everything in the past 2 weeks check gear list) so I'll write again after that.

Train,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544749,Trying to slowly condition myself for this trip. Been on the treadmill a lot. But I'm trying to find time to get out and hike more even if it's a few miles around the house. Planning a trip to hike the URE Trail and this is going to be the best conditioning I can get because of the steep hill climbs and constant ups and downs. Going to try to hike it about three more times before June of next year. Going to go and hike Morrow Mtn as well. Those trails never get old. That's going to be the best preparation I can do physically. Mentally I've got the drive am I ready but I'm still going to condition mind as well as body. I've been reading a ton and have read about the ups and downs from Georgia all the way to Maine. Days are ticking by and June will be here in the blink of an eye. I'll be ready.,,Conditioning,"Aug 05, Fri",0
