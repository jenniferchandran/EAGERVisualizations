Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564457,"Being nearly out of food, it was important to get to Waynesboro for a resupply. It was going to be a long day especially given that it would take a little time to get to the trail. 
We got up and packed early so we could be ready to have breakfast when the restaurant opened at 7. This also got our tents packed up before the rain which was due at any moment. While ordering breakfast, we arranged for a shuttle back to the trail at 8 which gave us plenty of time to eat. This is a free service provided by the brewery. The driver was one of the maintenance guys who was tapped to bring us back. He was great to talk to dine he had a lot of knowledge about the brewery and the effects of the recent buyout.
Once back on the trail, we started making our way toward the road crossing for Waynesboro. ""Haiku""s dad was going to give us a ride into town. I figured we would get there somewhere around 6 given we didn't start until 8:30. We couldn't waste a lot of time because of the distance. Fortunately, the temperatures were going to be much cooler because of the rain. That meant we didn't feel the need to avoid the heat after lunch by taking an extended break. Of course, the rain started shortly after we were on the trail. It never rained hard during the morning. The clouds move in and out giving us some views along the way. Cedar Bluffs gave us a wonderful view of the valley. 
Once we made it to the top of Humpback Mountain, we enjoyed the faster pace of a long downhill. The rest of the hike was in the woods without much in the way of views. There were wildflowers to enjoyed instead. Earlier in the day, we came across a patch of Trilliums both white and pink. 
We stopped at the shelter for a quick lunch. There were a fair number of section hikers there who were enjoying a swim in the stream in front of the shelter. While we were eating, it began to rain hard. There was also lightening and thunder. I looked at the weather on my phone to see the storm pattern. The current rain storm didn't look like it would last that long so we waited it out. We had to move quickly after it passed because there was a bigger one right behind it. It looked as if it would arrive fairly close to when we would get to the road crossing. 
Once the storm passed, we headed toward our final destination. We were moving at a quick pace to try to beat the next storm. We did stop long enough to look at the chimney ruins that was mentioned in the guidebook. Other than that, we just hiked. ""Haiku"" picked up the pace a little so she got to the road crossing first. ""Wick"" and I weren't to far behind. Other than a couple of sprinkles, we beat the storm. We got into the car and it was off to town to dry out and shower. I stayed at a hotel downtown because it had access to all of the places I needed to go. ""Haiku""s dad dropped me off. After we were all cleaned up, ""Haiku""s dad picked me up and we all went to get dinner. Since it was Monday night, Ming Garden want open so we had to go elsewhere for dinner. Afterwards, I was dropped off at the hotel and after taking care of some great related things, I called it a night.","Reeds Gap

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551112,"The five year anniversary of the completion of my first thru-hike was almost a month ago. Much has happened since I finished the trail both, good and not so good. The most significant circumstance of the past 5 years is my occupation. It simply has not been what I hoped it to be. Don't get me wrong. I do appreciate the opportunity that I had. I've been blessed with good income and the owners were gracious enough to allow me to go do my first thru-hike. On my return, I anticipated being able to continue where I had left off. There were a couple of problems with that. First of all, even with me telling the owners my goals for work and travel, there was a rumor going around that I was going to quit anytime and go hike again. That, I believe, kept me from getting work that would hold my interest. I know there are times when the work is monotonous. I've dealt with my entire career and have no issues with it. Also, there was a lot of false hopes provided. There were other problems that should not be discussed in a public forum such as this. Basically, my time where I'm currently employed is over.When I came back from the trail, I came back to a world that just wasn't the same. My wife of 32 years had passed away just before I left for my hike. So I came back to a personal life that will forever be different. I knew that and yet, I was still troubled. Along with my personal life, my occupation was not what it was nor did it appear that it would ever be. Fortunately, I had something to come back to even though it wasn't what I hoped it would be. I had gotten to the point where I needed to change the direction of my life. So January 31st will be my last day with my current employer.I'm not sure what I'll be doing occupationally. There are lots of possibilities including just making it a retirement. One thing is for sure, I do intend to explore. For starters, a second hike of the AT seems to be the thing to do. Sure, I could head out west to hike the PCT or CDT, both of which I will do. A return to the AT allows me to hike in familiar surroundings while wrestling with what I'm going to do occupationally. Most importantly, it affords me the opportunity to hike this trail under different circumstances. So given all of the above, I'll start off with a second thru-hike of the AT. Let the adventures begin!",,Reflection,"Nov 01, Tue",0
Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551797,"I made my start date official on the ATC's website. It will be Feb 16. I now have most of the gear I'll need. Just need gaitors for the snow and some warm socks for sleeping in. The plan for gear is to carry the heavy winter gear all the way to 19E. At that point it will be close to spring with the trail out of the higher altitudes for the most post. The backpack for the first leg will be an Osprey Aether 85. That will give me the volume and weight carrying capacity to haul a zero degree bag, extra clothes, special winter gear and extra food. Though the Smoky's is the stretch that most people think about winter weather on an early start, the trail before and after can be just as bad.Once I'm at 19E, I'll head home switch out to lighter winter gear (15 degree bag, less special gear, etc) that will get my weight down to something reasonable. I'll be using a ULA Catalyst or maybe the Circuit for the remainder of the hike. Somewhere up north, I'll switch to somewhat lighter winter gear like a 30 degree bag and no special gear. That should get me all the way to Katahdin. The weather in the northeast in June and July I'll have to research more.It's the day after Thanksgiving and thoughts about being thankful are running through my head. It's been a rough 10 or so years but I still have much to be thankful for. I'll be walking away from my job that has sustained me for almost 21 years. Without a doubt, I'm thankful to have had that job but I'm also thankful that I can pursue my dreams. At the end of Shawshank Redemption, Red makes a statement that seems perfect. ""I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at a start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.""Now, I hope...",,Date is set,"Nov 25, Fri",0
Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553109,"I turned in my resignation at work a while back with the last day set to the Jan 31st. Yes, it's a big step but I think I'm ready. This hike will be the first of many post employment adventures. It was a little over 6 years since my wife passing. The one thought that I couldn't get away from was that life is precious. Why am I wasting it on the pursuit of wealth? I have run the race and crossed the finish line. Now it's time to pursue something else. That something else is what's on my heart, becoming an adventurer. I still haven't bought all of the gear that I'll need, but that shouldn't be too much of an issue. Just gaitors, water proof glove covers and socks. I'll purchase food along the way except for the first resupply at Neal's Gap. I'll mail a package there just before I head out. Even with those minor things to do, I'm ready to get started!Though I'm at peace with the decision to quit my job, I still deal with a lot of emotions when I think about how things will be post employment. I feel good about the planning that was done to allow me to move on. I've gotten great counsel on that. So it's not worries like that that bother me. I guess it's the excitement that I feel mixed with other thoughts. I'm entering into a new world, a new way of life. Everything I've done so far has prepared me for it yet there is so much that is new. I guess that I can't plan out exactly how it will play out. There are hopes that I have. I hope that I can find folks with whom I can have rich meaningful friendships. I hope that these adventures will be as rich as I've imagined them to be. I know that I'll need to be flexible and willing to try new things as well as adjust what I'm doing to accommodate the little surprises that will come my way. I'm entering into this new way of life with a positive attitude so I have an expectation of great things. With that attitude, I'll certainly work towards making the best of whatever situation in which I find myself. There's a sense of urgency to do all that I would like to do mixed with the calm that I feel about everything working out. There's a desire to find my soulmate who would join me on these adventures mixed with the thought that that might not happen. I must remember though that like what I learned on my first thru-hike, things will work out differently than I thought they would and probably will be better than what I imagined. After all, that's what faith is all about.",,Geting closer...,"Jan 09, Mon",0
Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554321,"At the time of this entry, it's been a week since I've walked away from my job. I've been busy doing work on the house, preparing for my thru-hike and taking care of financial affairs because of the transition to not being employed. It's been a little surreal not having to get up in the morning to go to work. I still get up about the same time as always but now just relax in the morning instead of rushing to get to work at a reasonable time.Last Thursday, my son dropped me off at Iron Mountain Gap so I could hike to 19E and test out winter gear. The weather was going to be cold especially Friday night so what better way to check out the gear than to immerse myself in some cold conditions. The other nice thing about doing this hike was that I could hike a little more of the section hike I started back in 2009. I chuckled to myself as I started that I was going to be doing another thru-hike before finishing this section hike! Oh well, the section hike was meant to be something I could do a little at a time if I didn't want to do another long distance hike. When I approached Ash Gap where I planned to stay, I started encountering a lot of snow on the trail. It wasn't very deep but I didn't expect to see that much snow. I found a place at Ash to pitch the tent, got water for the evening and morning and made dinner. The weather was decent but chilly enough the make me want to just crawl into the sleeping bag a little early. While I was moving, my feet were fine. Once I stopped, they started getting a little cold. It was also getting dark so there wasn't much of a reason to stay out in the cold. I pulled off the boots and put on a pair of Heat Holder socks and got my pad inflated and the sleeping bag laid out. These socks did a great job keeping my feet warm though it took a little time for them to warm up. By the next morning my thought was: Do I have to put my boots back on? The second day of my hike, I put on the gaitors so that the snow that I knew I'd encounter wouldn't get my pants legs wet.It didn't take long to end up hiking in snow again. I had to be mindful of where the trail was because of the snow. Looking at the snow, I could see lots of different footprints from the animals in the area. I was able to identify deer, bear, rabbit, raccoon and bobcat tracks as I climbed up to the top of Roan. The trail had be redone since 2011 with lots of switchbacks which crossed the old trail many times. The new trail is much nicer and will be easier to maintain because of the reduced grade. This was fruit of the HardCore project of 2011 led by Bob Peoples. Congrats to all who worked on it. It was well done!I made to the top of Roan and headed down to Carver's Gap, grabbed a snack and continued to the ""barn"" officially known as Overmountain Shelter. The true test of my winter gear happened that night. The wind was about 15 to 20 Mph and the temps got down into the low teens. My feet got cold again and I realized that my legs were also cool. I figured out that I needed to get some heavier leggings. Not only would my legs be warmer but I think it would help with my feet. In loft of the barn, the underside of the sleeping pad isn't protected as would be on the ground in a tent. I could tell that the pad was a little cooler than normal but I was still very comfortable. I got up the next morning, made breakfast and headed down the trail to 19E to meet my son. The second and third days were a little under 10miles each making this hike a relatively easy one. I didn't want to push it too hard and get an injury. It was just enough to start getting me into shape for the start of the thru-hike. I figured that I needed to tweak the gear a little bit to get ready for the hike but I'm basically ready to go. Just need to pull together a couple of resupply boxes for the early part where in town resupply is poor, get the gear finalized and I'm ready to go!",,Winter gear shakedown hike,"Feb 07, Tue",0
Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554656,"I'm sitting in the lobby of the lodge at Amicalola State Park as this entry is being written. Tomorrow, the hike starts! I was blessed to be driven down here by Miss Janet. It was a fun drive as we took part of the Blue Ridge Parkway coming out of Asheville. The motivation was to avoid I 40 just because of the traffic. It was a nice drive with lots of wonderful views. We couldn't drive all the way to where the Parkway crosses 441/23 because it was closed where it crosses 276. We had dinner in Dahlonega before getting to the lodge. After saying our goodbyes, I got a room and came back out to the lobby. I've been going through my gear list in my head and realized that I missed just a couple of items. Nothing major but stuff I'll have to get eventually. I guess there will always be those items that will get left behind. I've learned not to get too much over stuff like that. There certainly are more important things to be concerned about. It seems that things just work out and in ways not anticipated. That was a principle I learned on my first hike. So many first time hikers fret over every detail. Pack weight, resupply strategies among other things are discussed in detail of Facebook pages and forums. I was just like that on my first hike. Now as a seasoned hiker, I take care of the things that I know need to be tended to in the spirit of just getting reasonably close. If there's something I've missed, I know it will probably be OK. I'm not trying to arrogant or careless. I just have gotten to this point where I'm relaxed.",,Twas the night before hiking...,"Feb 15, Wed",0
Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554772,"I ended up getting up later than I wanted to because of a restless night. I guess the excitement of doing a second thru-hike just kept me up. I went to the restaurant to get some breakfast. While there, I met the first thru-hiker of my trip, Hugs. He and his dad were having breakfast together. Once done, it was back to the room to get water and pack up. After checking out, I found the approach trail and stayed walking to Springer mountain. The actual miles for the day was 12 miles. The portion of the approach trail that I did was 7.7 miles. I started at the top of the falls so I didn't have to climb the steps. On my first hike, I did the steps and ended up hurting my knee. It healed quickly but I wasn't going to risk it on this trip.The first several miles was peaceful and quiet. The weather was beautiful but cold. I kept my jacket on until noon. While hiking, I met the another hiker, Giggles. He and his son, Chets, were hiking together to Franklin where Chets was going to get off and head back home and leave Giggles to continue on his own. Chets was at the top of the climb where I met his dad. I made my way to the shelter right before Springer where I met Chuck who didn't have a trail name at that point. He told the story about how his wife had called him Chunky Monkey because of his large food bag. He was sure he wanted that trail name but after hearing the story, I told him he needed to embrace it since it was perfect. We hiked up to the top of Springer together, signed the guest book and did pictures at the plaque. While up there we met a mother daughter pair who asked us our trail names. Chunky Monkey reluctantly tools hike his and again I encouraged him to take it as a trail name. At that point, he did. We made our way down Springer and talked about being on the actual AT. We were on the hike! I don't know what it is about the second hike but I was a little emotional about it. It's not that I have anything to prove since I've done it once. I'm not sure what it is about this hike. I guess I'll figure it out somewhere along the way. Chunky Monkey and I made our way down to Stover Creek Shelter not sure we wanted to continue or not. Hugs was already there along with another guy named G-man. Also there were the ridge runners for this year on a training hike. Chloe and another lady I met back in October were part of the group. It was a nice surprise to see them. One of the other ridge runners told us if a camping spot about a mile and a half further north. Chunky Monkey and I, after having to listen to G-man talk almost nonstop, decided to push on to that spot. We did the usual camp chores, had dinner and chatted awhile then head to our respective tents.","Twas the night before hiking...

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554773,"The temperature last night wasn't too cold so getting up was relatively easy. I got packed up and ready to go by 8. Since we were camped just a few miles from Hawk Mountain shelter, I decided to take off right away to, hmm, take care of business there. ""Hugs"" had come by just before then to say hello before heading down the trail. I told ""Chunky Monkey"" that I would see him down the trail. It was a cool morning at the start but it quickly warmed up enough to where I started removing layers. I'm not sure where the winter weather went but I'll take it. No complaints here.I got to check out the camping area just before the shelter. It seemed to be nicely done. This was put in to relieve the shelter area of the stress of all of the tents that are typically used there. Hawk Mountain shelter is a nice distance from Springer so it is a favorite stop for thru-hikers just starting out. With 3000 to 4000 starting every year, one can imagine the impact on the shelter area. I went a little further to the shelter itself and took care of that business I mentioned earlier. Afterwards, I sat and ate a snack while talking to a couple of section hikers. I waited for ""Chunky Monkey"" to catch up and after awhile, figured he had stopped somewhere before then so I headed on. There were a couple of fairly stout climbs today. The heavier pack was certainly felt going up those. It was also a little frustrating knowing that I was carrying gear that wasn't needed at the moment. The way I look at it, I'm building strength in my legs for later on in the hike.After hiking up and down those climbs, I finally made it to the Gooch Gap shelter. ""Hugs"" was already there as well as several other folks. There are a lot of people on the trail right now. Some are section hikers but most are thru-hiking. I really thought that I would be more isolated than this. It's been great meeting everyone and it seems that I'm meeting new folks everyday. I waited at the shelter for ""Chunky Monkey"". We had talked about going a little further than the shelter to try to make the next day shorter since rain was expected. ""Hugs"" liked the idea so the three of us headed out together once ""Chunky Monkey"" got there. We hiked a little over a mile and found a decent spot at Gooch Gap. There's a forest service road next to the camping area which isn't ideal but it's a great spot otherwise. We had dinner around a campfire and just talked about our day's adventures.","Three Forks

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554878,"It turns out that the dirt road that went by where we were camped was busier than we thought. There was a fair amount of traffic on it until about 9. Fortunately, it wasn't too much of an issue. I still slept well. There was a threat of rain for the next day which meant we could be packing up in the rain. When I woke, I noticed it wasn't raining. I immediately started packing in hopes of beating the rain. As it turned out, it didn't start until later in the morning so it wasn't an issue. I got going and started heading toward what turned out to be our destination. The plan was to get to Woods Hole then decide about continuing to the Blood Mountain Shelter. I hiked by myself until I got to Woody Gap. There were day hikers getting on the trail heading north so there was some company for part of the hike. Shortly after Woody Gap, the rain started. It was a light rain that persisted for the rest of the day.I hadn't seen anyone from the group all day. I thought ""Hugs"" was in front of me and would be at the shelter when I arrived. I knew ""Chunky Monkey"" was behind me since I left before him. With the rain, I wanted to get a spot in the shelter just to keep everything as dry as possible. I pressed on for the shelter stopping to enjoy views along the way and talking with folks that were day hiking. I finally made it to the shelter along with 4 others, ""Rambling Man"", Natalie, ""Noro"" and ""Gaitor"". ""Hugs"" wasn't there. The question I had was: did he just head on to Blood Mountain? I didn't feel like continuing to Blood Mountain and decided to just stay put even if he did. As it turned out, I passed him while he was on a side trail. He came rolling into the shelter sometime later. Little by little, others came into the shelter area including ""Chunky Monkey"" who was struggling with a calf cramp. Given everyone's situation, we decided to stay and give ourselves a break. There was a family of 5 who set up their tent behind the shelter, a father daughter team, ""Doc"" and ""Tunes"", and a few others were amongst those who came in after us.After getting things setup, I headed back to the water source only to discover that it was dry. I even walked down the hill from the designated spot to see if there was seepage further down. There was a couple of very small puddles but other than that, there was nothing. I went back to the shelter and let everyone know the situation. Fortunately, we had enough to make it to the morning. For dinner, I just ate one of my lunches plus a couple of snacks. I had skipped lunch because my stomach was a little upset from something I ate earlier. By dinner time, I was better. By not cooking, it left me with enough water for breakfast tomorrow plus water to get to Neel's Gap. We sat around and got know the folks I hadn't met before. It was great how we all enjoyed the our time together despite the cold and wet weather.","Gooch Gap

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554879,"During the night, the rain had stopped and it has warmed up slightly. I didn't sleep real well because of the noise in the shelter, the wind and just the fact that it was just a shelter. Every time I stay in a shelter, I'm reminded why I don't like being in a shelter. I got up and packed, had breakfast and started down the trail towards Neel's Gap. ""Chunky Monkey"" reserved a cabin that myself, ""Hugs"" and a guy named Danny shared. With four of us splitting the cost, it would be affordable.I had maybe a half a cup of water to hike with which was enough to get me to the base of Blood Mountain where there was a water source. Others were in the same condition. But that water source was also dry. So we had to just head to Neel's Gap with what we had.The mountain was foggy so views were obscured. Today was just a day of hiking it seemed. After getting to the top, we spent time at Blood Mountain Shelter. Its claim to fame is it's the oldest shelter on the trail. It's made of stone and could be fitted with a door. I imagine that there was once one but it fell into disrepair and was taken down. After taking a few pictures, we headed down the mountain. I ended up hiking with Natalie and ""Rambling Man"" all the way down to Neel's Gap. On the way down, we stopped at balance rock to take pictures.We got down to Neel's Gap and hung out in the outfitters until everyone arrived. The two guys, ""Noro"" and ""Gaitor"" continued on to Hogpin Gap to finish their section hike. Natalie decided to continue hiking even though she had a couple of nasty blisters.

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554912,"Well, it was the end of civilized life. We got up and pack up everything. ""Hugs"" bought sausage and cheese croissants for all of us which was wonderful. I also ate a couple packets of oatmeal. A couple of days ago, I had an upset stomach that had killed my appetite at lunchtime. I finally got my appetite back. I headed to the outfitters to use the WiFi to update my trail journal and answer an email before getting on the trail. ""Chunky Monkey"" wasn't feeling well and ended up spending another night at Neel's Gap. Hopefully, he'll catch back up to us. He's a great guy and we miss him. Danny headed out first followed by ""Hugs"" then myself. I took my time today since I didn't have my trail legs. In thinking about my pack, I realized that the severe weather great really isn't needed until the smoky's. I'm going to mail it to the Fontana Dam post office and save some weight. I'll do that once I get to the next town. There were a couple of nice overlooks before reaching Tesnatee Gap. I stopped at the first one, Wolf Laurel Top to have a snack and just relax. There were a lot of day hikers that hiked from Tesnatee to the second overlook, Cow Ridge. Those were the only folks I saw on the trail for the first part of the day. There were a lot of people at the shelters leading up to Neel's Gap so the lack of folks today was a little surprising. The only explanation is that it was mostly section hikers enjoying the three day weekend. When I got to Hogpen Gap, I bumped into ""Doc"" and ""Tunes"", the father-daughter team whom I met at Woods Hole Shelter. Mom is driving an RV basically following then up the trail. They were in the parking lot sorting out gear. I waited for them and the three of us headed down the trail together. The time went quickly as we conversed. We made it to our destination where Danny and ""Hugs"" were waiting. We decided to stay there for the night. This group has been a wonderful group to be in. I don't expect the experience to be the same as my first through hike yet I hope it to be rewarding. Baltimore Jack once said that a second thru-hike is like going to your favorite theater again to see a different movie. Our conversation was filled with laughter and good stories.

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555016,"I got up earlier than normal so that we could get on the trail and get to the shelter before it rained. ""Hugs"" was the first out of the camp. ""Doc"", ""Tunes"", Danny and I left a little while later. The first part of the hike was fairly easy and mostly a hike through the forest. Without the leaves on the trees, we could see much more than normal. We passed the time playing a game called ghost. Afterwards, we talked about a trail name for ""Doc"" who really didn't have one. His daughter ""Tunes"" kidded him about passing gas so the idea of calling him ""Old Fart"" came up. He wasn't really keen on that one but she kept pushing for him to accept it as a trail name. The rule is one can always reject a name given to them. He wanted to be called ""Fun and Games"" since he forgot to bring the bag containing the deck of cards. Someone else suggested ""Indy"" because of the Indiana Jones style hat he was wearing. He liked that but ""Tunes"" still pressed for ""Old Fart"". This debate continued the entire time we hiked. To my readers: what's your vote? We would love to hear from you! We eventually got to the first major road crossing after Neel's Gap called Unicoi Gap. It was also the first trail magic I encountered other than the jugs of water that I saw. After enjoying a quick break, we started making our way up out of the gap. The climb out was one of the major ones in Georgia. We descended down from the peak and stopped for lunch. We headed to the camping spot called the cheese factory, the site of a dairy farm that had been demolished some time ago. I got a bunch of water just before that point on the advice of the guy doing the trail magic. He told us that the shelter's water source was dry. So I carried 3 liters up the mountain only to find out that the water source was fine. Normally, I would carry about a liter so that was four extra pounds of water. I wasn't too happy about that. The question of ""Old Fart"" was resolved shortly after getting to the shelter. He's accepted it though with a little reluctance. Even though, we still want to hear your thoughts. He can still change it. Natalie who I met at Woods Hole Shelter was there and also got her trail name, ""Spice Girl"". She carries several spices for her meals. Danny also got named ""WhaDya Say"" because his ears were covered up by his down hat and he couldn't always hear what was said. The rain finally came just after I got in my tent. There wasn't shelter space so I set it up. I really don't like staying in the shelters anyways so I'm fine with it. It supposed to rain off and on tonight. Hopefully, it will stop before we start in the morning.","Poplar Stamp Gap

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555017,"Got up to very wet conditions with a lot of moisture in the tent. Thankfully, I'm heading into town so drying out will be easy. Got packed up early, had breakfast and hit the trail as a group. ""Old Fart""s wife is following him and ""Tunes"" in an RV. He has offered to take us to Hiawassee. So they plus ""Hugs"", ""Whadya Say"" and myself hiked as a group to the road crossing. The rain quit but the trees dropped water on us almost the entire way. As the fog past through the forest, it condenses on the trees causing them to drip water. Today was one of those days that just hiking was all there was. The fog obscured our views and the wet ground made footing a little uncertain. Still, we had fun making the best of the wet conditions. ""Tunes"" has a wonderful voice for singing. She entertained us with a few songs as we hiked. We've been kicking around a team name since it appears we enjoy hiking together. It wonderful to be with such a great group of folks. They had me out front setting the pace for the whole group. I just hiked like I normally do and ended up paving the group so that we were at the road crossing around 12:30. It was probably a little too fast but it also gave us plenty of time to take care of all of the town chores. The hardest climb was Kellys Knob. As we hiked this section, several memories came to mind. One was ""Morning Glory"" struggling up that climb back in 2009. When he was passed by ""B"", he told her ""I don't know who this Kelly guy is but I hate him and his knob"". Memories of meeting folks in that area during my first thru-hike also came to mind. Now, I'm in the same stretch of trail making new memories. Will I ever hike this stretch again? Hard to say. If I do, I'll have more memories to smile about. We were caught by ""Rambling Man"" as we got closer to the road which was amazing given we didn't take much of a break. Though I was hungry during the last few miles, I didn't ask the group to stop as they seemed pleased to keep moving. We made it to the road crossing and met Nancy there. We decided that the RV was headquarters and her trail name should be ""General"". With a smile, she gladly accepted it. She took us and another hiker named Matthew into town and dropped us off at the Holiday Inn Express. We got started on town chores and pigged out at a buffet near the hotel. I'm now sitting in the lobby relaxing while updating my journal. Fatigue is beginning to overcome me so it's best that I finish this.","Tray Mountain Shelter

We ate as much as we could, packed up and headed toward the other end of town to get a ride back to the trail. After hitch hiking didn't work out, we walk to the Budget Inn to see about a shuttle. They didn't have a shuttle service until the first of March but gave us the name of someone who provided a shuttle. We were joined by another hiker and after a short wait, we were heading to the trail head. The lady that did the shuttling was interesting. Her and her partner moved to Hiawassee from Florida. They were kayaking enthusiasts and did some hiking.After being dropped off, it was down the trail we went. The Georgia/North Carolina border was up ahead! Today, we were going to be done with Georgia. It also was the first time we hiked in an area where there was a fire. The fire damage wasn't that bad. It was clear that the duff had been burned. There were burn rings around several trees where the duff touched the tree. Once we crossed a forest service road, we didn't see any more burnt forest. I guess the forest service road did a good job of stopping the fire's progression. As we got close to the border, I met a friend whom I hadn't seen since the Southern Ruck, ""Lawn Chair"". He was hiking a small stretch at a time then heading home to take care of things there. We all crossed the border together and took pictures. After the short celebration, we headed to a nearby water source to fill up. At that point, I realized that I left my dirty water bladder back at the hotel. Fortunately, ""Hugs"" had one that would work with my setup. It's unusual for me to do that but I'm human. After getting our water, we had to tackle the climb out of Bly Gap. It was a steep, fairly long stretch that really drained me. We finally got to the shelter hoping to see ""Doc"" and ""Tunes"". They decided to keep going. By the way, ""Doc"" had decided to not accept ""Old Fart"" as a trail name. We hiked for a couple of more miles and stopped for the night.","Dick's Creek Gap

So the tent had to be packed wet in the hopes that it could be dried later. I had the breakfast mix that I created a couple of weeks before the hike. The idea was to mix it up a little for breakfast. There are a couple of things I do to keep breakfast interesting. This is one of them. We took off after everyone was ready. The day's journey started with the long but easy climb up Standing Indian Mountain. As we headed up the mountain, we could see all of the fire damage from last fall's fire. It was sad to see it but it's part the natural world's way of renewal. The camping area where I stayed in 2011 was closed because it was so heavily used many camping spots were closed for the purpose of restoring these areas. There are so many hikers now that camping spots are getting damaged. We got to the shelter to use the facilities. A younger couple was there packing up named ""Wick"" and Kate (no trail name). Afterwards, we continued the long hike up the mountain. My stomach began to get a little upset and it progressed to the point of me throwing up. It was the second time that breakfast has bothered my stomach. This time it was worst. I decided that I am not going to have that breakfast anymore. I couldn't eat a snack or lunch which is not a his situation when one is trying to hike. Despite my stomach issues, we still were moving along nicely. We stopped at another gap so ""Hugs"" and ""Whadya Say"" could have lunch then continued on. We talked about hiking to Albert Mountain since we were making good time. Most if the day, it was foggy so there wasn't a lot to see except burnt forest. Some of the Rhododendron trees that had fire damage lost their leaves. I don't know if this means the tree was killed or if it was just distressed. As we headed down toward our destination, ""Whadya Say"" tripped on his shoe laces again. His shoes were irritating his ankles so he didn't tie them all the way. That left the laces to dangle enough to catch on things like the other shoe. ""Hugs"" decided he needed to change his trail name to ""Falls"" because there was a good story behind it. So it was changed. We made it to the camping spot and after ""Hugs"" saw how nice it was, we decided to stay for the night. About an hour or so later, ""Wick"" and Kate showed up. We had dinner, first us then ""Wick"" and Kate. The food hang was the comedy show for the day. The branch I picked ended up being weaker than I thought. When ""Hugs"" and I tried to pull the bags up, the branch broke. While attempting to do the next hang, the rope almost got tangled up. After much laughter, our food was finally hung. We sat around a campfire just sharing stories. Shortly after dark, we decided it was bed time and that ended our delightful fireside chat.","Wateroak Gap

Even with several hours of the tent closed up, there wasn't any condensation. The rain, of course, got the outside of the tent wet so it ended up being packed wet. We packed up quickly so we could get to town around lunchtime. The big event of the day was the climb up Albert Mountain. It's steep with rock scrambles but not too long of a climb. The fire tower is very close to end of the climb. With the fog so thick, views from the tower were obscured. We joke that we had a great view of the fog. There was a cold front coming in so it was chilly up there. We decided to head down to get warmer. One of the casualties of the efforts to restore done of the overused areas was Big Springs Shelter. The shelter has been taken down and the area closed to allow it to recover. A new shelter has been built about 2 miles further down the trail to replace it. As we continued hiking toward the road crossing, the fog lifted and we realized that Albert Mountain was probably clear. ""Falls"" joked that moral of the story was sleep in. Along the way, we got up on a ridge that gave us a great view of the town of Franklin. After staying there a bit, we headed for the road crossing. The hitch into town was in the back of a pickup truck. At first, it was very cold because of the wind chill. As we got into town, it warmed up and of course the speed limit was lower. We got a spot at Gooder Grove and immediately headed into town to the outfitters. ""Hugs"" and ""Falls"" got new shoes and looked for a replacement hydration bladder. We grabbed lunch at a diner then head back to the hostel for a shower. A friend of mine picked us up and took us to Walmart for our resupply. We then went to a new brewery and just hung out.

It seems that whatever I eat just doesn't hold me anymore.
A few days ago, we decided that we'd hike to NOC in 2 days. That meant getting to Cold Spring Shelter today, a nearly 16 mile day. The trail took us up to the worst of the fire damaged areas, Wayah Bald. The tower on top list its roof to the fire. The trees around the tower were the most fire damaged trees we've seen fire the whole hike. ""Hugs"" and I were hiking together with ""Falls"" lagging behind, taking it slow. It began to snow on top of a Wayah Bald where the tower was so we decided not to have lunch there even though we were very hungry. Instead, we stopped at the shelter beyond the tower for lunch then headed for our destination. This was the longest day on the trail so far so the fatigue kicked in a couple of miles from the end.

I took a picture just before the fog came in and obscured the view. We entered the last of the burned forest as we approached Tellico Gap. As with the other areas that were burned, some spots had light damage while others had heavier damage. The tower on top of Wesser Bald was intact. So were both of the shelters. I was amazed that these structures weren't damaged given the fire damage all around. ""Hugs"" and I stopped at the Wesser Bald Shelter for a snack and a break.

It's probably good that since it saves a little money. After breakfast, ""Dakota"", ""Hugs', ""Falls"" and I took off for the trail. The climb out of NOC is a tough one because if its length. Overall, the grade isn't too bad, just 10% average. I forgot to get water before I left so I couldn't get a drink until I was halfway up where there was a water source. The nice thing was I didn't have to carry it up the first part of the climb.The weather was beginning to turn bad as we were climbing. The forecast was calling for thunderstorms later in the day. I was going to be off of the mountain peaks when the storms arrived. There's tree cover on the mountain peaks but it's still not the best place to be in a thunderstorm. Given the situation, I pushed the pace a little harder than normal.We got to the first shelter past the NOC for lunch. ""Wick"" and ""High Coup"" joined us. We all talked about getting to the same shelter which made for a long day. ""Dakota"" was the only one who ended opting not to go. Because of the shelter spacing, it was either stay at Sassafras shelter where we met for lunch or go all the way to Brown Fork Gap shelter. There was camping options but given the storm, it wasn't ideal. ""Hugs"" and I were the first to head out. We got over Cheoah Bald before the storm hit which greatly pleased me. It would have been nice to stay at Cheoah Bald for the night if the weather was going to be clear. From the top, one can see both a sunset and a sunrise against a wonderful mountain backdrop. As we came down the mountain peak, the rain started. It would come in short light bursts that were not that frequent. After a while, it subsided and we were able to dry out.We got down to Stecoah Gap leaving us about 2.5 miles to go for the shelter. The tough part was having to climb Jacob's Ladder, a 20% grade that is 0.6 miles long. It was a long hard day to get to where we were so I didn't cherish the idea of hiking up that climb. As we got closer to Jacob's Ladder, the rain hit. This time it lasted longer and was harder. I didn't put on rain pants which ended up being a mistake. It didn't take long for my pants to be soaked. I guess I was more interested in getting there so I thought I could just put up with being wet. The climb up Jacob's Ladder took s while. My legs were tired to the point is requiring lots of breaks. The lightening was flashing around us every 10 minutes or so. I wanted to get up and over that peak because of the potential of a ground strike. The shelter was a short distance from the peak and we arrived wet but happy to be there. I got out of my wet clothes to stay warm, setup my sleeping bag in the shelter and when the rain stopped for a moment, went and got water for dinner.

Whoever it was, look us over then headed to a flat spot in front of the shelter to setup camp. I watched for a little while simply because it was unusual for someone to arrive so late. Once I saw that this person was setting up camp, I figured it was someone who held up at Sassafras Gap shelter until the rain stopped then night hiked in. I went back to sleep without worrying about who it was. I thought it might even be ""Dakota"" who decided to continue. The next morning, I look towards the area where this person setup and noticed that they cowboy camped on top of a tarp ground cover with blankets for warmth. It was obvious that he didn't have the gear he needed. If it had rained after he arrived with the temperatures where they were, he would have died. We all got up and made a fire to warm him up. He didn't have any food or water and had no way to filter water or cook himself a meal. I think he was a homeless person who decided to hike. After getting him taken care of the best we could, we headed out. ""Hugs"" and I were the first to leave of our group followed by ""Falls"" then ""Wick"" and ""High Coup"". Normally, I'll catch up to ""Hugs"" but he set a fast pace. Nothing motivates better like the lure of a shower and a place to get warm. I got to the next shelter and after realizing that ""Hugs"" didn't stop, continued on. A short way up the hill, I came across a blow down (trail lingo for tree that fell across the trail). Only the smaller branches were over the trail but it still was unpassable except by cutting a new path around it. I pulled out my small saw and cut a few of the branches so that one could get through without going off trail. I simply prefer that hikers remain on the existing trails so that the impact to the forest from hikers be minimized. I continued up to the ridge above that shelter and stopped at a spot for lunch that had a wonderful view of Fontana Lake. The rest of the hike was mostly downhill from that point. Once I got close to the lake, I crossed the highway leading to the dam and continued on the last stretch towards the famous shelter near the lake called the ""Fontana Hilton"". There were two more blow downs that I cleared with my small saw. The second of these two required a lot of work. ""Falls"" who was close behind me helped out with this last one. It took a while but we got it cleared. I think the storm from the previous day knocked these trees down since they weren't dried out at all.

It was a buffet style so there was plenty to eat. Right after breakfast, we got a shuttle to the parking lot above the shelter and we were heading down the trail. ""Hugs"" took off and I just decided to take it easy as did ""Falls"". About a week before I left for my hike, I did some work on my section clearing water bars and debris. When I was done, there was only one blow down. After 4 weeks, there were 5 new blow downs. It was a little discouraging but that's nature. I had a very heavy pack with both winter gear and food. The amount of food to carry is tricky because of the potential of bad weather. If Newfound Gap is closed, then resupply in Gatlinburg is very difficult. So the question is do I take a chance on the weather or carry extra food. I opted for the latter at the expense of weight. So going up the hills was slow. The weather today was just perfect for hiking. As I climbed up, I could see Shuckstack. The lack of leaves on the trees also made views all the better. There is a rocky section on the way to Shuckstack where one can see Fontana Village. As I came down from Doe Knob, I could see Cades Cove. Of course, on the ridgeline, I could see other mountains through the barren trees. What is neat is I've hiked though this stretch many times on other hiking trips and maintenence trips. Yet its beauty stood out like it was the first time I passed through. I stopped at Mollies Ridge Shelter for lunch and a break. I realized that I had gotten there by 3pm. I started thinking about the first time I did that hike. It took me until 5pm and I didn't have as much gear back then. The improvement in my fitness level over the years was very gratifying. I headed towards Russell Field at a nice easy pace the idea was to get there late in hopes that the shelter would be full and I'd have to stay in my tent. On my way over, I met the new Ridge Runner. The guy who used fill that role retired. After conversing with new guy whom I knew I would see again, I continued toward the shelter. When I got there, it was half full so the tent wasn't an option.

It was the start of the climb to Rocky Top. I got up towards the top and looked back toward where I had come. The ridgeline we hike yesterday and today could be seen. Of in the distance, the grassy fields around Cades Cove could be seen. I continued up toward the top with the intent of having my midday snack on top.I found a spot that gave me the same view that I had moments earlier. After looking at it a while, I found Shuck Stack with its tower. From there I was able to following the ridgeline more closely than before, retracing or steps since leaving Fontana Dam. I began to think about how sometimes looking back can be beneficial. There's great encouragement to be had from realizing what one has accomplished. There's also much that is learned from reflecting on all that has happened both good and bad. Difficult circumstances tend to teach us more than good ones. All of this made me ponder the last 6 years of my life. Many good things have happened but the tough ones with their underlying mistakes are the motivation for correction. Well, the downside of looking back is that one can spend too much time in the past. So it's time to pack up the snack bag and continue hiking. This stretch of trail is tough. There's a lot of ups and downs with some being steep. Our goal was to get to Silars Bald Shelter which is s total of 14 miles or so. ""Falls"" caught up to me and we both decided to have lunch at Derrick Knob Shelter. Once there, we met a couple of young kids who acted like the characters in the movie, Wayne's World. They told us they were gong to stop at Silars Bald Shelter. We were now motivated to go the extra 1.7 miles to Double Springs Shelter. I could tell my energy level was dropping. Each hill became more difficult. We finally made it to Silars Bald Shelter where ""Hugs"" was waiting. We were all in agreement with hiking to Double Springs so after a short break, we took off.

This stretch immerses one in the beauty of the Smoky Mountains. If it's clear enough, the town of Gatlinburg can be seen. But our hike only gave us the best view of wind blown fog. As we approached Clingman's Dome, it wasn't visible like it normally is. After a while, we reached Clingman's Dome. We took the side trail to the observation deck. Of course, nothing could be seen. The wind was strong enough to make us cold so not a lot of time was spent up there. The hike down was treacherous with all the ice. It wasn't enough to put on crampons but it did slow us down. I slipped and pulled a leg muscle. Also slowing us down were blow downs. There were many trees that had been toppled by the winter storms. Our early start didn't give the trail crews enough time to go in and clear them out. When we got to the side trail for the Mt Collins Shelter, we realized that we were going to be late getting to the Gap. We shifted into fast hike mode to try to make up time. We arrived at the parking lot about an hour late. ""Miss America"" was there with Arby sandwiches and cokes. Those were just perfect. We were hungry and needed something to help with the recovery. She brought us into town and speed us off. Tomorrow, we'll be having breakfast with her. We showered, did the normal town chores and then went to eat at the Smoky Mountain Brewery.

I waited for ""Hugs"" before taking off. ""Falls"" and ""Stealth"" have been hiking at a slower pace so they told us they'd catch up later. We agreed to meet at Walnut Mountain Shelter to discuss going farther. It was cold, windy and foggy from the storm. It wasn't raining but the fog would condense in the trees and drip on us as we hiked.The intensity of the wind increased as we started up Max Patch, a treeless knob that normally has great views. By the time we got up there, the visibility was about 10 to 20 feet with winds strong enough to push us sideways. The temperature was also dropping making for uncomfortable conditions. We didn't spend a lot of time on top. We stopped for a quick snack once we got out of the wind then headed to shelter afterwards for lunch. It was hard to stay warm so it was back on the trail to generate enough heat to stay warm. I started feeling the previous day's hike as we headed up Walnut Mountain. The shelter is just on the other side so ""Hugs"" took off and said he'd meet there. The clouds cleared but the wind was still blowing hard. We had a hard time staying warm so we left the others a note telling them that we were going to find a camping spot that was warmer. We stopped at a couple of places that either weren't flat or didn't have a good water source. We headed up over Bluff Mountain and located a spot that was on an old logging road. There was a good water source not to far. Unfortunately, it was windy there too. We got our tents setup and when we came back after getting our water, the others had shown up. We had dinner and because of the end and cold called it a night.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

I didn't have a normal breakfast because I was running low on food. I ate food bars and a beef stick. That was fine because I didn't want to take the time to cook in that cold. Hot Springs was coming up and all I could think about was something other than trail food for lunch.""Hugs"" took no time packing up. He was cold so he took off. A little while later, I was heading down the trail too. The hike into Hot Springs was an easy one. The skies were clear at the start. I knew a storm was coming in that was suppose to dump a few inches of snow. The rest of the week was going to be very cold so I started to rethink the idea of having Ben come by and pick me up so I could do a gear swap out. My normal winter gear would be marginal given the forecast.As I was coming down, I could see the town through the trees. The clouds came in as I descended but there was no fog to obscure my view. When I was about a mile away, the snow started coming down. It was a picturesque scene. A small town with snow falling. Once I got to town, I found ""Hugs"" and we went to get something to eat. We were joined by ""Falls"" and ""Stealth"" a short while later. I checked the weather to be sure and decided to tell Ben not to come by. Fortunately, he hadn't left. After eating, I went to pay for my meal and realized I didn't have my credit card. I had left it back in Gatlinburg at the place we had breakfast. I called to verify and sure enough, it was there.

""Stealth"" ended up giving me a ride back to Hot Springs and took ""Hugs"" back to Asheville for his dentist appointment Monday. After having lunch and updating my trail journal, I got on the trail. My goal was to get to Rich Mountain. I started later than I wanted to so it wasn't possible to go further to the shelter that was another four miles. The first part of the hike goes up to a rock ledge called Lover's Leap. From there, the view of the town was great. I continued along the ridge enjoying the views on both sides. The French Broad river was visible on the right and the mountains where I was going was on the left. The hike to Rich Mountain was a long climb. The weather was great. I hiked in a short sleeve shirt and never felt cold. I ended up in a camping area that wasn't on top so that I wouldn't be subject to any winds. I got camp setup, had a wonderful dinner and crawled into my sleeping bag to warm up because the temperature was dropping. It'll be a cold one tonight.

There were a couple of hikers who had decided to stay on top on the mountain where the fire tower was. I could tell that the winds up there were stronger than where I was. Though it would have been nice to get a sunset from up there, it wasn't worth being uncomfortable.I didn't get going right away because of the cold. I laid there watching the sunrise. I finally got motivated, ate breakfast and packed up. I headed down the trail to my next spot. The wind was strong when I left and it didn't get calm until I got to Allen Gap. The views were great since there wasn't fog.From Allen Gap, it was all climbing. There is a shelter about two thirds of the way up. I decided to stop there for lunch. I ran out of water much quicker than I thought I would. I hoped that I could find a stream along the way. As I continued up, I met ""Mama Bear"" and her daughter ""Smiles"" taking a break. I last saw then at Fontana. We chatted for a little while then I continued on up the mountain. It seemed like I was never going to get to the shelter. I was so thirsty that I started eating snow to stay hydrated. All white snow, of course! I was also hungry which didn't help either. I slowly made my way to the shelter, took off my pack and headed for the water source. A guy named ""No Hurry"" was there just finishing lunch. While filtering water, I had lunch. ""No Hurry"" and I chatted the entire time. After lunch, I continued up the mountain. It started sleeting as I was making my way up. It would only sleet in short bursts and not very much each time.

It generally wasn't heavy but still knocked the snow off of the tent to keep it from building up too much. I usually an awake around 2am so this didn't mess up my sleep. I didn't get up right away hoping the snow would stop so I could have breakfast. I ended up making it just outside my tent. I packed up and started down the trail. I was the first to hike in the new snow. I was careful to watch the blazes to be sure I didn't wander off on a side trail. Most of the time, it was obvious where the trail was so there really wasn't too many worries there. Firescald Mountain was one of the stretches I had to go over. There's a lot of boulders to climb over. Given the snow and the fact I was hiking by myself, I had to consider taking the bad weather trail. It's a conservative move for sure as I probably wound do ok. There wasn't a big benefit to going over it except to say I stayed on the trail. Views were nonexistent and given I've been on it twice in good weather, I didn't feel the need to risk it. I'll come back later and do that stretch as a loop from the parking area nearby. I trudged along in the snow by myself until I reached Jerry Cabin Shelter where I knew a bunch of folks stayed. I had a snack and continued after resting a couple of minutes. Now, I had the footprints of everyone who stayed at the shelter before me as a guide. If they all missed a turn, I would be right with them. As it is said, misery loves company. I stopped at Flint Mountain Shelter for lunch and to evaluate the possibility of going on. It was mid afternoon, I needed to charge my phone and battery pack and was wanting to get out of the extreme cold. Decided to hike to the hostel hoping that there would be enough space for me. It was at a lower altitude so even if I had to stay in my tent there, it wound be warmer and probably less windy. So it was off I went. The hike from the shelter was easy which was good given that I was getting tired. I had moved at a pretty good pace to get to Flint. The next 3 miles to the hostel was generally downhill with just one climb coming out of Devil's Fork Gap. When I got to the hostel, I found it to be packed. It was cold in there because the floor was made with planks that had gaps. The cold air would come up through the cracks overwhelming the meager heater. The owner took us to town for dinner at a Mexican restaurant. Uncle Johnny's crew were also there. I got to see a few folks who had gotten ahead of me.

The next stretch would put us around Bald Mountain which would be very cold. I simply didn't have the gear for it. The hostel was very cold and uncomfortable so I wasn't interested in staying there. I texted my son and he said he would be willing to pick me and any other hikers up at Sam's Gap. So it was decided to hike to there and get a ride back home.A group of us started later in the morning knowing that we didn't want to get there too early and stand at the gap waiting for Ben to get there. The hike was difficult because of the snow. There were drifts up to a foot that we had to walk through. That made the going slow and tedious. Added to that was a long climb. At one point, we made it to an overlook where the view of the ridgeline that was next on the trail was visible. We could see the top of Bald Mountain at the end of the range. We finally got to the gap tired but happy that we would be going into town. We told Ben that we'd be there at 4:30 and amazingly that's was when we got there. He showed up about 15 minutes later and soon, we were headed down the mountain to the comforts of the modern world. We got dinner at a Asian restaurant then Ben dropped the other hikers off at a hotel then dropped me off at home. The shower was heavenly since it was hot. I spread out my wet gear which was actually still frozen then crawled into bed.

Ben agreed to pick us up after work like the day before and take us back to the car that was left at Sam's Gap. Once there, we wasted no time getting started. The hike was basically a long climb up to the top of Bald Mountain then a descent down to Spivey Gap with a couple of climbs along the descent. Like yesterday, the snow made hiking tough. The nice thing is we didn't have full gear so that reduced the effort. Our footing was tricky because the snow covered up rocks and roots. We took our time climbing up the mountain. At various points along the way, we could see Bald Mountain. Its very top was void of trees and snow covered. We knew the winds would be stronger up there because of the exposed top. We just hoped it wasn't too rough up there. We cleared the treeline and began to reach the very top. The landscape around the mountain became visible. The mountains in the distance still had snow but it was on the ground only. It had fallen off of the trees by the time we got up there. The trees look as if they were dark trim along the edge of the mountains making them very distinct. The whole to of Bald Mountain was snow covered with the markers covered in wind blown ice that pointed in the direction of the wind. It was a incredible winter scene. Well, the wind was blowing hard enough to make us want to get down. We took pictures then headed down the other side. Even though we weren't climbing, it was still tedious hiking in the snow. As we came down the mountain, there was less snow on the ground making the going easier. We passed High Rocks without stopping to climb up them just because we were getting tired. I slipped and fell a couple of times on ice. Nobody else did so I guess that makes me the uncoordinated one? We made it to the parking area just a couple of minutes before Ben arrived. We chuckled about the well timed arrival. Ben drove us to Sam's Gap to pick up the other car. We headed out to get something to eat then dropped everyone else off at their hotel. I finally arrived home and got busy switching to more moderate winter gear. I dropped about 5-6 lbs off of my base weight which will help with be able to go longer without as much fatigue.

I was at 160 lbs which is 4 lbs more than what I weighed at the end of my first hike. I needed to eat more. I packed my food bags with that in mind. ""Sweet Tea"", a fellow hiker from 2011 sent me s bunch of goodies which I did share. There was a lot of stuff she sent. I packed a lot of it for myself since I definitely need the calories. Ben came by to drive over with us so he could bring the car back after we got started. I ended up hiking by myself since I was trying to hike a lot of miles. My goal is to finish by the end of July so felt the need to start pushing the daily distances. That's where the lighter pack will help. Also, a friend wants to cover it and hike with me in the Damascus area so there's extra motivation to get moving. The hike from Spivey Gap to Erwin was fairly easy since it was an overall downhill hike. I got to Uncle Johnny's Hostel around 1:30 and took advantage of the wifi to take care of a few things that I forgot to deal with when I was at home. I then left from there and made my way to the shelter. It was a long climb that I began to feel towards the end of the hike. When I figured out my overall pace, I was quite pleased. I've got my trail legs. I arrived at the shelter just as the rain started. Only ""Switchback"" was there when I arrived. I decided to stay in the shelter because of the rain. My major complaint with shelters is the noise. Given it was just two of us, that wasn't going to be an issue. We chatted as we had dinner then just climbed into our sleeping bags to stay warm.

I was thankful that I didn't set up my tent. I delayed starting to allow the rain to stop. I had breakfast, packed up and took off. The ground was very muddy from the rain making my footing interesting at times. Several times, my foot slide off of the trail. A couple of the streams ""Switchback"" and I crossed before getting to Indian Grave Gap were flowing very fast. Because of the higher water level, crossing them were tricky. We hiked together for a while until I couldn't match his pace. He's young and fairly strong so it was just a matter of time before he pulled away. I hiked the rest of the day by myself. The only folks that I met were a trail crew cleaning up blow downs and other debris. They were also going to repair the picnic table at the shelter I stayed at last night. The clouds began to clear thus getting my hopes up of having a nice view at beauty spot. Just as I got close, the clouds rolled in and there was nothing to see up there. Sigh. I stopped once I was out of the wind for a snack to fuel me up Unaka Mountain. I started the climb up the mountain after getting some water. It's a long climb but the spruce forest at the top is the reward for the effort. There's just something neat about that forest. The floor is full of pine needles instead of leaves. There are many exposed roots throughout the forest. The close packing of the trees darkens the forest more than the other forests we hike through. It's like being in a different world fire a moment then popping back into reality when one exits. It also reminds me of Maine. In fact, much of the trail in the south has touches of the same characteristics of the trail in Maine. In a way, we are being prepared for what's to come. As I was coming down the mountain, I ran into a lot of water on the trail that was runoff from the melting snow and the rain from the previous night. I finally got past all of that and made it to the shelter at Cherry Gap. I ate lunch there and took a short break. While there I briefly thought about going a little further but decided against it. It was going to be a long day stopping where I stopped. Going further would have been too much. I finally got to the camping spot and after verifying the water source, I setup camp.

I ended up adding a base layer to my legs in the middle of the night to compensate. Other than that, my rest was great. I got up later than I wanted to. Because of that, I didn't get on the trail until a little before 9am.The first part of the hike was just going through the area around Greasy Creek Gap. On the peaks there was ice hanging from the trees. A younger hiker named ""Honey Bun"" caught up to me on one of the climbs while I was struggling with pain on the outside of my right hip. We chatted a little and after explaining the situation, he offered a few suggestions and went on. After he left, I figured out it was my pack riding too low. After making some adjustments, I was fine. I've been pushing the mileage so I've been a little paranoid about aches and pains. I stopped by the shelter to have a quick snack then headed on. It wasn't too long before I crossed Hughes Gap and started the climb up to the top of Roan. It was the last time I'd be above 6000 feet. It also meant that it would be warmer just because of the lower altitude. As I got closer to the top, the ice in the trees was heavier. I came across an evergreen that was completely covered with ice crystals. It looked like a frosted Christmas tree. The trail near the top of Roan was loaded with ice making the hike tedious and slow. I knew that there would be ice on the downhill side also. I had left my cleats at home thinking I didn't need then anymore. I had forgotten about Roan. The hike all the way to Carver's Gap was slow as I worked my way down the ice covered trail. I never fell but I did have some close calls.Once at Carver's Gap, I crossed the road to the balds which were mostly void of ice. I thought about going to Overmountain Shelter but with the loss of time in the icy stretch down Roan, I new that I couldn't make it there at a reasonable hour. I just hike the Roan Balds at a easy pace enjoying what views there were. All of Roan Mountain was beautiful with the ice covered trees. The rough part of the last part of the hike was the mud. With the melting snow, the trail had become a mess. I just trudged through it all the way to the shelter. Hopefully, the mud will freeze overnight so that tomorrow's hike won't be so bad.

I'm guessing that the temps were around 25 deg given that the water bladder laying on the ground with stuff on it started to freeze. The stuff I put on the bladder was suppose to provide insulation so the ground would keep it above freezing. If the temps are low enough, this doesn't work. In that case, it has to be kept inside the sleeping bag. I already had a cell phone, glasses with case, two epipens and the water filter. I got up and just had granola with dehydrated with bananas added. It was a simple breakfast that turned out to be tasty. I packed up as quick as I could trying to stay warm. My feet are cold the moment the shoes go on because the shoes have been sitting outside all night. They will not be put in the sleeping bag. They're just too dirty. I got on the trail and immediately started the climb up to Little Hump Mountain. It didn't take long for my feet to warm up. When I got up the hill enough, I could see Overmountain Shelter just above the trees. I continued up the mountain avoiding the icy patches along the way. Given that the mountain is exposed, the sun had more opportunity to melt the snow. The mud on the trail was frozen so my boots didn't get loaded up with snow like yesterday. I wasn't sure how long that was going to last though. At some point, it's going to get warm enough to soften. The view on Little Hump was cool but I knew that Hump Mountain was taller and offered a 360 degree view. So it was off to climb Hump. As I got toward the top, I could tell the trail was beginning to soften and get muddy. I finally made it to the top a little exhausted but not too bad. It was a clear day but very windy. From the top, I could see Grassy Ridge, Jane Bald, Round Bald and Roan Mountain. I took a 360 panoramic picture with my phone starting as close to due north as I could determine without a compass.After goofing off a little and enjoying the view, I started heading down the mountain. I was going to stay at Mountain Harbor for the night and wanted to get there in time for a shower, do laundry and take care of resupply. As I came down, I encountered the mud once again. There were also patches of ice that were slippery enough to cause a fall. This made hiking a little slow. When I got down a little, I met a guy named ""Crazy Tree"". We had a great time talking while we negotiated the mud, ice and rocks. We finally got past all of that and found the camping area that was close to where the shelter used to be. We stopped for lunch and water then continued to the road crossing. He wanted to hike to the next shelter so we parted ways knowing that we'd bump into each other later on.When I arrived at the hostel, there wasn't a lot of options. There were two private rooms in the main house, the tree house or tenting available. The tree house sounded interesting and wasn't too expensive so I opted for that. My only complaint was there was no electricity. Other than that, it was a neat spot to sleep for the night. I did all of the usual town chores and then hung out with the other hikers in the bunkhouse. While there, I charged up my phone and battery pack.

I figured that would give my tummy a chance to settle out. It was 10:40 before I got to the trail. My plan was to hike 16 miles so I knew it was going to be a long day. Fortunately, the terrain was a lot easier than it had been for the last couple of weeks. After going up and over the ridge, I got to the side trail for Jones Falls. It's a beautiful fall that is worth the hike down the side trail even if it's my third time to see it. After the falls, I continued down the trail. It was mostly flat with a couple of short hills. Compared to what I had been hiking, it was a little mundane. The next highlight fir the day was the bench. There is an opening in the trees that offer a great view Hump Mountain and the Roan Balds if the air is clear. After relaxing there for a while, I headed for the camping area. There wasn't much to see for the rest hike. It was the same up and down as earlier. I finally got to where I wanted to stop, setup camp and made dinner.

Early in the morning, I came up with the idea of using a small tree to free the rope from the tree. My pocket knife has a saw blade so it would be easy to find a suitable tree, cut it down and delimb it. First thing I did was find the perfect tree then cut it down. After prepping it, I raised it up to free the bag that the rope was attached to. I figured that the weight of the food bags would pull it through the spot where it was stuck. When that didn't work, I took down the bags and cleared the rope of all knots. I then hooked the end of the tree in the bag and pulled it down to the ground. It was then just a matter of pulling the rest of the rope through. I was quite happy with how that worked out. I had breakfast, packed up and headed down the trail with a smile on my face. The first part of the hike took me to Dennis Cove Rd where Kincora was located. I stayed there on my first thru-hike but this time, I skipped it because of where I was on the trail. I camped just a few miles from it so it didn't make sense to stop there again. From there, it was a steep descent to Laurel Fork Falls. There was a lot of water from the snow melting in the mountains which have the falls an intensity that I haven't seen before. There were a few people there who had hiked in from Hampton but not as many as I thought. After enjoying the falls, I continued on. I had gotten there pretty close to noon and I realized that I had time to go into Hampton and have something to eat. My plan was to camp at the top of Pond Flats which was about 2.5 miles. Even though it was uphill, I figured I could get up it in time for dinner. While waking back to the trailhead, I met a guy named ""Impala"". A friend of mine told me to look for him. He was planning to do a fast hike so at some point, he'd catch me. We chatted a bit and before parting ways, I told him where I was going to camp for the night. He said that he would join me. The climb up the mountain wasn't too bad. I felt good even with a full belly at the start. Of course, it wasn't long before that full belly was wanting to eat again. By the time I got to the top, I was hungry again. I found the campsite and the spring that was north of it, setup camp and made dinner. Just as I finished up, ""Impala"" made it to camp. He setup in the same area. We spent the evening sharing stories before turning in for night.","Campsite @ 410.4

I packed in a relaxing manner and was still on the trail at 8:30. I think I'm beginning to get my efficiency back.Shortly after starting, I began the descent down Pond Flats towards Watauga Lake. The stretch from there all the way to the other side of the dam is closed to camping because of a problem bear or bears whichever the case may be. Pond Flats is the last camping spot before that stretch other than the one that's too close to the road. The hike along the lake was pleasant other than the chilly wind. There were times I was cold and needed a jacket and other times, when the sun shined, that a short sleeve shirt was all that was needed. Eventually, I didn't need the jacket anymore. After hiking over the dam, the trail climbed to the top of a ridge that ran along the edge of the river. The lack of leaves allowed for a great view of the lake and valley beyond it. Vandeventer Shelter was a great place to view this valley. The lake could be seen to the south of the ridgeline. With the weather being so nice and the view so clear, the experience of it all made the climb to the top of the ridge worth it. I met a couple of guys working on finishing touches to a new bridge at the start of the hike around the lake. We traded stories about trail work. I also met another guy who did maintenance on another section of trail north of the lake. He also was a ranger who educated hikers about the wilderness and leave no trace concepts. The latter is very important on the AT these days because of the number of folks hiking. The better hikers are about minimizing the impact to the wilderness, the better it will be preserved. After leaving the Vandeventer shelter, I started to really get tired. Climbing the last hill before the gap where I had planned to stay was harder than it should have been. I finally realized that I haven't been eating enough. I sat down and ate a bunch of food. I had candies, an extra package of M&M's and tortillas. I just sat there and munched. A couple of young hikers came by we chatted while I snacked. ""Highlighter"" was taking about how they had gone into Hampton to eat. Eric, who didn't have a trail name, ate a lot of stuff at the McDonald's. The trail name I thought of for him was ""Sarlac"", the name if the creature in the desert in Episode VI of Star Wars. The funny thing was ""Highlighter"" had thought of the same trail name. Eric accepted it and has been named. After my snack, I was ready to hike to the camping spot. I felt better but still was dragging a little. Once I arrived, I verified that there was water then setup camp. I made my highest calorie meal then ate a 1/3 of a package of mashed potatoes. The goal was to get caught back up on my calories. After cleaning up and hanging my food, I crawled into the tent for the night. I'm looking forward to being picked up by a friend.

Saturday, we will slack pack from Elk Garden back into Damascus. Given that the hike is also easy, there wasn't an urgency to get up early. Still, I got going by 9am.As I hiked along, there were places that I remembered from my 2011. A sort of hike down memory lane. The weather today was much better though and that brought me back to the moment. The air was cool and the sun was out. It soon warmed up enough to hike in just a t-shirt. It was a nice change from the weather a couple of weeks ago. There were views from the ridge but only because there were no leaves on the trees. After a while, the trail took me off of the ridge to connect to the ridgeline that ultimately would take me into Damascus. It crossed hwy 91 and went to a field that had a bench at the top of the hill. The trail is built as a handicap addressable to allow those in wheelchairs to enjoy the beauty of the area. I sat at the bench for a while and had lunch. The view of Shady Valley was just wonderful. Farms could be seen off in the distance. There's something about the peaceful life of country living that just makes me smile. Folks who live here are certainly blessed. After spending a half an hour or so, I continued toward 421. There weren't a lot of hikers on the trail so it was a bit of a lonely trek. There's not even a lot of animals out. I saw my first squirrel today. In fact, it startled me simply because I wasn't used to the nose they make. The night before, there was a deer wandering around the woods near my tent. Spring is on its way for sure. Next, the leaves will be on the trees, the flowers will bloom and the forest will come to life. I met a young couple as I approached 421, the first people I saw. Their trail names haven't been picked but they were seriously considering ""Hansel"" and ""Gretel"" which I really liked. I got to 421 around 3 in the afternoon which was much earlier than I wanted. I rinsed my shirt in the spring in a desperate attempt to get some of the stink out of it. I just ended up with a wet, stinky shirt. My friend fit there earlier than expected and it was off to Damascus for dinner and the hostel.","Campsite @439.9

We got a shuttle to Elk Garden early in the morning and hiked southward towards Damascus. Mind you, I still had the stretch from 421 to Damascus to hike. That will be done tomorrow. From our start, we had an easy hike up to Whitetop Mountain. The weather was just perfect: Clear, not too hot and minimal wind. From the mountain top, the views were great. We stopped at several points to soak it in. The next spot was a place called Buzzard Rock, a short distance down from Whitetop. From there, we had views on both sides of the ridgeline. After enjoying these views, we headed down off of the mountain. One of the nice aspects of hiking southward is the potential of seeing folks whom I hiked with that had gotten ahead of me. I wasn't disappointed. There were a total of seven hikers that I had hiked with that saw me on the way to Damascus. They were all surprised and wondered what was going on. Of course, I explained what I was doing. We got to a forest service road and stopped for a snack. Virginia has a fair number of farms so there are open fields. It was one of those fields where we found a couple of rocks to sit on. After our break, we headed down the trail. The trail eventually gets to the Creeper trail to cross the Luther Hassinger bridge. There were several folks riding bikes down the creeper trail but not as many as there are later in the summer. Given we were walking on that trail, we didn't have to worry about them dodging us or I should say, failing to do so. The trail breaks away from the Creeper Trail after a short distance. Mary Anne began to get blisters so she switched out to different pair of shoes to take the pressure off of those spots. Eventually, we stopped to let her stick her feet in the stream to relieve the pain. We crossed hwy 58 a second time and all that was left was a climb up the last hill before getting into Damascus. It was a long day and that hill was a little bit daunting after so many miles. Fortunately, it was not too steep. We made to the top without too much trouble. The thought of getting ice cream once in Damascus helped me get to the top. It wasn't too long before we were back in town. It was showers then off to get dinner. Afterwards, we hit the bunks. We were both tired.","Elk Garden

It was raining but not too hard. The prospect of rain is what motivated us to switch up the hiking the way we did. We got to do Whitetop in perfect weather on Saturday instead of doing it in the rain today. It was a great idea on her part. This stretch of trail is easy once one gets up to the Abingdon Gap Shelter. I thought I'd be hiking in the rain all day but about an hour into it, the rain stopped then another hour later, the sun came out and stayed out for the rest of the day. With the warmth of the sun and the gentle breeze, it didn't take long for everything to dry out. I got to the shelter much quicker than I thought I would. I realized that I might be able to make it to Damascus in time to attend an evening service at the church in town. Of course, I would take a shower and wear my best hiker clothes! The hike followed a ridgeline into Damascus. I could see through the leafless trees to the valley below. One of the advantages of hiking in the winter time is being able to see a lot more. Once the leaves come out, the views through these leafless trees gives way to abundant life of the trees with their leaves. Each have their blessings. I finally made it to the Virginia border. The significance isn't that I'm now hiking in Virginia since that was done yesterday but I finished Tennessee. I did some fun videos at the sign to continue my theme of sneaking across the borders then continued to town. I made it there, got to the hostel and took a shower. I napped for a while then headed to town for the church service. I came back to the hostel where dinner waited. ""Penguin"" was there nursing shin splints. We sat outside and talked while I ate.

Larry made breakfast for everyone a little early since my friend was due to arrive at 7:30 to give me a ride. I was already packed up so I just needed to get dressed and eat. We got to Elk Garden at about 8 and I was on the trail. I felt sluggish all day. The breakfast I had was quite large and I think that was the cause. At least I knew I wouldn't run out of energy. I started without any water knowing that I could get what I need not too far from the start. That allowed me to do the initial part of the climb without water weight. I finally got water about 2 miles in and continued on. After passing the side trail for Mount Rodgers, I knew I was close to the first shelter for the day, Thomas Knob. When I arrive there were ponies hanging out around the shelter. One of them like something on the shelter floor given it was licking it. As I hiked through this area, I met a lot of hikers not on the AT as a thru-hiker. Most were day hikers that started at Grayson Highlands and came up to the AT. Once I got to Massie Gap, they all disappeared and I was by myself. I eventually got through the Grayson Highlands Park and started towards my destination for the day. The weather was great so the views were spectacular. I'm blessed to live close by. I can come out as often as I want and hike around this area. When I got to the area know as the Scales, I met a hiker who was section hiking. He was a seasoned hiker who has lots of stories to tell. We hiked together all the way to the shelter. I decided to stay since hiking any further wasn't going to help me get where I needed to be to meet my friend on Friday. I would have ended up camping at the shelter where I was going to meet him at noon. That would have meant hanging around for four hours Friday morning.

At this point, I was now done with the part of the trail that I had done multiple times. For the Trail Days after my first thru-hike, I hiked from Fox Creek down to Damascus as a home coming. I was introduced to the idea from some guys who were hiking southward when I thru-hiked.Most of the day was slightly misty. I never got wet but I could feel mist on my face. Occasionally, water would drip from the trees. There wasn't a whole lot in the way of views and one just had to appreciate the woods around them. The highlight of the day was Comers Creek Cascades. I find it interesting that after passing through a section where there are incredible views, the trail afterwards can become mundane. To combat this, one must look a little harder fir the beauty that is there.I made it to Trimpi Shelter around 2pm thinking that I worked stay there. It didn't seem like a good idea to go too far then have a short hike to where I was going to meet ""Morning Glory"" the next day. But handing around a shelter didn't seem like a lot of fun so after having lunch, I decided to hike a little further to a camping spot not far from the road crossing at the Mount Rodgers Visitor's Center where he was going to meet me.

The slow flowing stream which provided water could be heard. Evidently, it was a lot of rain. Still, the tent did well keeping me dry. Of course, the moisture in the air tends to dampen everything inside the tent. I waited for the rain to quit before I got out to start my morning routine. I had breakfast and packed up just as the rain picked up again. I had the impression that bad weather was on its way out by the way the rain was starting and stopping. I altered my packing routine do that the tent could be packed last. As I took down the tent, the rain stopped. I got as much water off of the tent as possible and put it in its stuff sack and packed in the backpack. As I headed down the trail, the trees were dripping from the last round of rain but it wasn't raining. I was curious about whether I could have hiked a little further last night when I stopped.

We decided to have lunch at the Barn Restaurant in Atkins. We hiked independently initially but all met up at the shelter just before Atkins. The first part of the trail was very rocky. It was enough that one should not look up at the scenery without stopping first. It's funny how easy it is to just hike along and only pay attention to the obstacles in the trail and miss the beauty all around. We as humans tend to focus on the problems in front of us and fail to appreciate what's around us. Most of us, if we're honest, are blessed. Yet our focus tends to be on what's bad, the rocks in the trail if you will. It would do us all good if we would take our eyes off of our problems and express thankfulness for what we do have. I try to stop often to look around and take in the views, look at the newly emerging flowers and see the majesty that is the forest.

My average for the day made me quite happy. It nice to know that I'm still in good shape. The morning routine was normal except I didn't cook breakfast. I just ate the rest of the granola with powdered milk and of course water. Doing this not only changes what I eat but it does save a little time in the morning. The first part of the hike took me up Walker Mountain then up over another ridge to a road where there was a pavilion. The owners don't want the hikers to use it so it wasn't an option for a lunch stop.I headed to the shelter that was a couple of miles further to stop for lunch. While there, a group of five section hikers trickled in from the north. They were finishing up at the pavilion and decided to stop for snacks. The nice thing was they were giving me their extra food. I'm not too proud to turn that down. We had such a great time talking that an hour went by before I realized it. I had to hike 9 more miles with a big climb at the end. I took off from there stopping a couple of times for water. The trail went through a couple of farms where hikers had to stay on the trail. The ATC does not own the land going through these farms. They have only an easement. The farm lands were beautiful with their fields. In the distance, the mountains could be seen.After passing through these areas, the climb up Chestnut Knob started. It's 4.5 miles to the top from the road crossing with the first part being steep. What made the day hard was having to climb the other hills earlier. My legs were tired and my hip was beginning to bother me a little. I stopped as needed and stretched to work out the pain. It's been improving but slowly. The climb eventually comes out in a clearing. It was something to celebrate because I knew there was only two miles left. I stopped to get water since the springs at the shelter were unreliable. As I continued up, the valley from where I came came into view. I wasn't sure exactly where the trail was in the valley so I couldn't figure out which farms it went through. There were many farms in the valley. Over the mountain ridge, I could get a glimpse of the valley behind it. There was a couple miles of valley that could be seen. I finally made it to the shelter. Because the inside looked a little run down and the word on the trail was it had a mouse problem, I decided that I would be in my tent. I found a place just beyond the shelter that had a great view of another valley called God's Thumbprint. There were mountains all around this valley which was full of farms. It got its name because it looks like a giant thumb pressed down the earth to make the valley. I thought I was going to be alone tonight. However, folks started trickling in including ""Medicine Man"" whom I thought was not going to push the miles because of his knee. ""Don Quixote"", a guy from Spain also joined us.

""Medicine Man"" left a little before me and ""Don Quixote"" left even earlier. I stopped for water about 2 miles into the hike since I knew there wouldn't be any for the next 8 miles. The hike was basically a ridge walk for 7 miles then a downhill for the last 3 miles. The hike along the ridge was tough because of short ups and downs. After a while, it just wears you down.

We stopped for a snack at a place that I thought would give us a good view. It wasn't the best but it worked. After finishing up, we continued our walk only to find an own field with a great view of the valley. I remembered the spot once we got there. Mary Anne said I was on probation. I'll have to do better at remembering these spots. We thought that there was enough time to move the shuttle to 3:00 so when we were at the top of the mountain, she talked to the shuttle driver and changed it. What we didn't realize was that the sign was wrong on the distances and we had a little further to go. That made for a fast hike down the hill when we figured it out. Fortunately, the amount of uphill hiking was minimal. There were a lot of pine trees across the trail around the shelter due to the gypsy moth. That slowed us down quite a bit. We got to the parking lot just 10 minutes late which is very good given the way things usually work out. Shuttle drivers are used to people arriving late. Mary Anne and I said our goodbyes and she was off to her car. I took a break to eat a snickers bar to fuel me up the hill to the shelter where I planned to stay. I arrived about 4:30 tired but feeling good about the time I spent with her. It was a drastic change to being by myself at the shelter. I set up my tent, made dinner and chilled out for a while before calling it a night.","Rice Field Shelter

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560109,"While I was going to sleep, another hiker came into the shelter. Since I was in my tent, I didn't see who it was. I got up, had breakfast, packed and headed out. Today, I decided to push some big miles. It was going to be a little rough so to give myself enough time, I started early. I finished climbing to the top of the ridge then walked along it heading for the next gap. This ridge was loaded with rocks that made hiking a little tricky. I had to focus on where I put my foot. It also took a while to get through that stretch. I finally made it to the Laurel Creek Shelter to have lunch. While there, the guy that showed up last night came by. It was ""Lone Ranger"" who I met back at Woods Hole Hostel. He was planning on going to the same shelter maybe further. We hiked together all the way to highway called VA 42. As we approached the highway, horses in an adjacent field came up to greet us. A lady who had just finished day hiking when we got there pulled out an apple core, broke into four pieces, one for each horse and we fed the horses. At this point, there was one last climb for the day. Then it was a ridge walk to the side trail for the shelter. I got water for the rest of the hike and started climbing.The cool highlight for this section was the Keffer Oak, the largest in the southern section of the trail. ""Downed Cow"" was at the tree when I got there so he took my picture while I leaned up against the tree.I thought about dry camping before I got to the shelter but decided against it because I'd have to carry extra water up to the ridge. I was tired and the climb was steep. I literally hit the wall about 2/3 of the way up. It was walk a little, rest then continue. Finally, I made it to the ridge where I could cruise much easier. It wasn't that far to the side trail for the shelter but it seemed like it took forever. I guess being tired distorts one's sense of time. Finally, I got there to find ""Downed Cow"" thinking about going on. He didn't have enough water to do it and there wasn't any for about 8 miles. He decided to head to the shelter. The hike down was about 0.4 of a mile. Again, it seemed longer. As I approached the shelter, I stayed looking for tenting options. The grind was flat but full of rocks. That would have made pushing tent stakes in tough. Before getting to the shelter, I decided to stay in there for the night. When I got there, only one spot remained. A family of six had gotten there earlier and took up all the space. ""Lone Ranger"", ""Downed Cow"" and I decided we would sleep on the platform around the picnic table and give the spot to ""Sweet Cheeks"" who was on her way. We made dinner and conversed as we normally do. It was nice being with a bunch of folks for a change.","Bailey's Gap Shelter

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560110,"Last night wasn't a good night fir getting sleep. I slept on the edge of the platform where the picnic table was. What I didn't realize was the full moon shined directly onto the spot where I was sleeping. I don't do well with a lot of light when I try to sleep. So I got up tired from the long hike yesterday and lack of sleep. So I got up, had breakfast and headed for my next destination. I can normally hike 16 miles by mid afternoon but I thought it best to take it easy so I could recover from yesterday's long hike. The terrain wasn't too bad. The day's climbs though long were not difficult. I stopped at Niday Shelter, the first shelter, to get a snack and just chill out for a while. It was getting hot and not having sunscreen was becoming a problem. My nose, arms and the back of my neck are getting burned. Though out of the sun, I knew I had to keep going. The forecast called for rain in the evening so I was hoping clouds would develop to help with the sun. So the delay, while keeping me out of the sun until the clouds showed, kept me from reaching my destination in a reasonable time. A couple of miles down the trail was a road crossing where there was sodas. I grabbed one and continued refreshed. From that road crossing, I climbed up the next ridge to where the Audie Murphy monument was then headed down the hill to trout creek where I stopped to rest for a while. I had another snack to get me through the last couple of miles to the shelter. Pickle Branch was familiar since I stayed there last time I hiked. Instead of tenting, I stayed in the shelter because of the forecast. When I arrived, ""Found It"" was there thinking about staying. He was doing a southbound section hike. He ended up staying after realizing how fast he'd have to hike to get to the next shelter. He was an interesting guy to talk to. Again, having company at the end of the day is great.","Sarver Hollow Shelter

Also, there's the Catawba Grocery where one can buy lunch. It's the perfect reward after Dragon's Tooth. I got up and packed pretty quickly. Breakfast was Granola Cereal using powdered milk. Because water was going to be scarce, I ran down to the creek to get more so I could have about two liters to get to the next water source. I said goodbye to ""Found It"" and started making my way up the mountain. The route up to the top was rocky with many short ups and downs that just wear you out. I was happy that I was only doing a little over 14 miles because I knew the rough terrain would be tiring. Once on top other mountain, I took the side trail to dragon's tooth. The rock is about 15 to 20 feet above the ground surrounding it. There's actually a couple of rocks that stick up but only one resembles a tooth. After hanging out for a while and getting some pictures, I went back to the trail. It was time to get a cheeseburger! The climb down the other side is very technical. There were a couple of places where iron rungs were placed into the rock to provide hand and foot holds. I just took my time coming down the rocky section so I wouldn't get injured. Eventually, I got to trail where there wasn't as much in the way of rocks then finally nice, rick free trail. I made it to the road crossing for the store and walked the 0.4 mile to the store. I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. While waiting, I also got enough food to get me to Daleville. After putting the food in my food bag, I went back inside to get my lunch. I sat outside at one of the picnic tables and ate it. I decided that wasn't enough so I went back inside and got a half of point of ice cream. It was chocolate with raspberries. After sitting there a while, I decided to get going. It was nine miles to the shelter and I didn't want to do it at night. The only problem was I was so bloated, that hiking was difficult. Lunch was great but I should have allowed it to settle a little longer. Not a big deal, I just plodded along until I was able to hike better.I finally got to the next road crossing. Down the road is a restaurant called the Homeplace. It's a country style, all you can eat place that's open Thursday to Sunday. Only problem was it was Wednesday. I'll have to come up another time. I crossed the road and started on the last two miles of the day. I found the shelter then located a nice tent spot. I set up, had dinner and just relaxed. While sitting there, I realized that I didn't get enough food to allow for two days to get to Daleville. It was going to be a long day tomorrow.

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560223,"I got up a little early because I needed to push into town today. Originally, I was going to stop a short distance from town and make the final push into town on Friday. Without having the food I need, that wasn't an option. I got on the trail a little before 8 after devouring a cinnamon roll and a chocolate muffin. Coffee would have been an awesome addition but I didn't want to take the time to boil water. The first highlight of the day was McAfee Knob. The view from up there is just wonderful. I didn't get my picture taken up there because I was by myself. Been the story of my hike! It's ok though. I've had time to reflect on all the events of the past couple of years. After spending time soaking in the beauty of the valley, I hiked on to the next highlight of the day, Tinker Cliffs. From McAfee Knob, the ridgeline that trail follows is easy to see. Also, the mountain upon which Tinker Cliffs resides is also visible. Well, it was down the ridge I went. The valley could be seen as I went especially when the trail topped the small peaks in the ridge. I finally made it up to the cliffs just in time to take a break. I found a spot that offered a great view of the valley, pulled out my snack bag and sat down. I ate my normal amount of snacks and drank an electrolyte replacement drink while enjoying the view. I took my time but realized I did have to move on. After packing up, I hiked along the ridge stopping at various points where there was a great view. It was a wonderful time being up there.Eventually, I started down from the cliffs towards Lamberts Meadow Shelter. I stopped to get water since I knew it was going to be the last stop before town. It was already hot and I knew it was going to get worst. Water and electrolytes were going to be important. While heading down to the shelter, a thought entered my mind. I had been telling people that I wanted to hike the AT again under different circumstances. Certainly not going through the grieving process that overshadowed my first hike would make for drastically different circumstances. But I realized that there was more. I was given the privilege of proof reading a book on post trail depression written by a good friend of mine. I had struggled with this issue but never felt I had resolved it at the time I did the proof read. By reading the first draft, I came to realize why I was struggling. I'm forever grateful to this friend. I had reached out to others with no resolution. It's amazing how a loving approach to someone's struggles can make all the difference. I felt those love filled words wrap their hands around my heart, mind and soul helping me to release those things that were burdening me. What a contrast to others whose words were a stick beating my mind into some narrow way of thinking without ever resolving the underlying issue. It was because of this friend's work, that I was able to have the courage to walk away from a job that was no longer where I needed to be. I was also able to look at my life and accept where I was and be comfortable with maybe never getting married again. I once sang the darker line:""I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied""Now, I feel that I'm learning to fly. Where things go, I can't say but I will just go in faith lead by the One in whom I've placed my hope. That is probably the most significant difference between my first hike and this one. I can now hike and being a blessing to those I meet along the way. To this friend, again I say, thank you!Well, the day wore on and it got hotter. I was doing well until I noticed pain under my toes on both feet. I stopped to check them out and not only were they blisters but ones that had popped. I never knew they were there until they got bad. Not a good situation. I guess the long distance, in the heat, over all of the rocks were too much. I have never had blisters this bad before. Fortunately, I'll be resting tomorrow. I got to the hotel and bumped into ""Lone Ranger"". After I got a shower, we headed out for dinner together. We caught up on where we were. Afterwards, we headed back to our rooms for the night. He'll be on the trail tomorrow so I'll not see him until later.","Catawba Shelter

A segment of the trail in Virginia that combines the beauty of the AT with that of the Parkway. For this stretch, the trail will cross or come close to the Parkway several times. This makes the trail unique. I had a friend, ""Bark"", who was going to meet me at Black Horse Gap to pick me up and take me to his house. I haven't seen him or his wife, ""Berry"", since my first thru-hike so I was looking forward to the reunion. I got up, put some miscellaneous items in my pack to finish packing and headed to the lobby for breakfast. Mary Anne was waiting for me to get there so we could eat together. After breakfast, we headed down the trail. The first part of the hike ran parallel to I-81 and fairly close too. At times the road noise was so loud that it was hard to carry on a conversation. I knew that we were heading to a road that crossed under the highway so that the trail would end up on the east side. Once there, the route would take us away from it and the noise associated with it. ""Medicine Man"" caught up to us after the highway crossing at the point were we officially crossed 730 miles, 1/3 of the journey. After celebrating the milestone, he went on. Mary Anne and I took our picture at a hill top just beyond that point then continued on. There was a long climb from that point to the first shelter along the way. While hiking up the hill, my leg was bothering me a little but it didn't seem too bad. I was encouraged by how well it was doing. We ended up stopping for a snack a little before the shelter without knowing we were so close.Once we got to the side trail for the shelter, we started into the longer downhill stretches. At this point, my leg started to bother me again. The pain was sharp at times but mostly just a dull ache. I began to realize that it was becoming more serious. I found some relief on the uphills but as the day wore on, the pain was more prevalent on the uphills. We got to a stream and I decided to take my boots and socks off and get relief from the cool water of the stream. Mary Anne did the same. It was a little humorous with the fish nibbling on our bare feet. I'm ticklish so it was hard to keep my feet in the water. Even with the fish bothering my feet, I got relief from the cool water. After getting our shoes back on, we headed on. We had plenty of time to reach the gap but I didn't want to get caught in any of the storms that were forecasted to occur around the mid afternoon. We stopped at Wilson Creek Shelter for lunch. While there, a hiker by the name of ""Wall Street"" came by. I had heard of him and he heard of me. We are both engineers so we had something in common besides being thru-hikers.After taking with him, Mary Anne and I headed for the gap. The last little bit was a steeper uphill than what we had been doing. My leg was really bothering me. I was so glad that we were close to finishing. We finally made it to the gap. ""Bark"" was there early so he was waiting for us when we arrived. I did my goodbyes to Mary Anne then hopped into ""Bark""s car for the trip to his house. This would probably be the last time Mary Anne would hike with me unless she can work out coming up to finish with me at Katahdin which I hope she will do. ""Bark"" and I got caught up on our way to his house. In a short time, we got there. I greeted ""Berry"" and met their children. I went to the store for resupply and we picked up pizzas for dinner.

Originally, I was going to hike my normal distance with all of my gear and enough food to get to the road crossing for Buena Vista. With an overuse injury, I decided to slack pack just 8 miles and see how I did. ""Bark"" drive me to where he picked me up so that I could hike to Bearwallow Gap where he would pick me up. The weather was absolutely perfect for hiking. I was comfortable in a t-shirt all day. I never really sweated the entire time I was hiking. The clouds started coming in later in the morning which kept it from getting hot. The trail crosses the Blue Ridge Parkway several times in this stretch. There were views of the valley to the west and east fit the first part of the hike. Eventually, the trail reaches the pull off for the Peaks of Otter where the mountains Sharptop and Flattop are visible. All of this was just beautiful. When there wasn't views, I enjoyed the many flowers that were along the trail.Initially, my leg felt very good but about five miles in, it started to hurt. I stopped for 15 minutes to let it recover which helped a lot. I found that the downhills were the hardest on it. The force of taking a step is absorbed by the muscles and tendons in the front of the lower leg. Going downhill has the most impact. I slowed down on those stretches to lessen the impact.I finally got to the parking area for ""Bark"" to pick me up and earlier than expected. I took some Ibuprofen and applied some Icy Hot to help with the swelling. Once I got back to ""Bark"" and ""Berry"" 's house, I iced the leg and elevated it.

""Bark"" dropped me off at the trailhead where I finished up yesterday. The first part of the hike has some views through the trees but was mostly forest. The leaves are now coming out on the trees, especially at lower elevations. Soon, the trail will become the green tunnel that it's know as. I stopped at the first shelter for a snack then continued to the only road crossing for the day. Once there, I recognized it as the swimming hole that a bunch of us swam at on my first hike. It was a little too cold to go swimming so I just hiked on. I had to stop shortly after that point because I felt something in my shoe around the ball of my foot. I pulled my shoe off to see what was in there. When nothing came out, I checked the sock for something that may have gotten caught in it. I couldn't find anything there either. I put my shoe back on and continued to hike. Again, I felt something underneath the ball of my foot. It was a sharp pain. I check everything again and couldn't find what was bothering my foot. Just on a whim, I pulled the insert out and found a rock that had gotten caught beneath it. It had worked is way through the foam and that's when it began to bother me. The crazy thing was I had a little discomfort there for a while to the point where I thought a blister was forming. My foot looked fine so I never worried about it. Once I got rid of the rock, that slight discomfort also went away. I headed on after resolving that issue with my foot feeling much better. About a mile before the next shelter, I stopped near a creek to have lunch and get water. I wasn't in a big hurry as I was making good time even though I was taking it easy. My leg wasn't bothering me and given I was near the beginning of the big climb to the Cornelius shelter, I felt good about how it was doing. I met a trail crew clearing blow downs and trimming brush. They were the first folks I saw on the trail. After talking for a bit, I continued on and started the climb up. It was a easy but long climb with a few spots where the trail leveled out. I took my time and eventually got to the top of the climb. There was a short downhill to the side trail for the shelter. I had a little discomfort in my leg. The long day had worn my leg out a little. I slowed down to minimize the impact. I made it to the shelter and ""Bark"" was there waiting on me. There's a trail that leads from the shelter to a forest service road that connects to the Parkway. We walked along this route to get to his car. There was a couple we met that was getting on the trail at that point. They were doing the trail in sections. They had a few questions about leaving their car and details about the route they were taking. It was obvious they were a little unprepared which was a little disconcerting. Once back at ""Bark"" and ""Berry""s house, I iced my foot then we had dinner. After joining them for family movie night, I headed for bed.

I planned to hike two short days to Glasgow so I just hike an easy pace. I met the couple from yesterday as I made my way up to Apple Orchid. They were hiking to the gap where I was going to stay for the night. Their car was parked there. The fun spot on the trail was the Guillotine. The trail passes between two very large rocks. So large, that it looks like a hallway in the rocks. There is a smaller rock wedged in above the trail that looks like a guillotine. It's a neat formation but I know that the weather will eventually break down these rocks and the smaller one will eventually fall to the ground. There were lots of flowers especially trilliums. I came across large fields of them. I had never seen so many of these flowers in one place like this. It's amazing how one can hike a stretch of trail during a slightly different time of year and see something different. This has been one of the treats I've experienced on this hike as compared to my previous hike. There was a long downhill to Petite's Gap. Given the trouble I had with my leg, I took it easy. It did very well all the way down. I've at the gap, I looked for a camping spot, set up and had dinner. The only negative was I close to the Parkway so the road noise was audible.

It's a complicated plan to get there and back but it should work especially with his help and the help of another friend in the area. I decided to take a more leisurely pace because of short day. When I look around the tent, I noticed puddles around the area at my feet. The foot box was also damp. I could see where water had seeped into the tent through the rain fly. There was also signs of other leaks. The rain last night was very light. If it had been heavier, I would have gotten quite wet. So another item added to the todo list is, buy another tent. I don't want to spend the money but being dry is important. I packed up, had breakfast and headed down the trail. My leg felt great giving me a lot of confidence that it was on the mend. It's the fastest I've healed up from this injury. Still, I'm plan to take it easy. Certainly don't want to inflame it again. There was a short climb out of the gap where I stayed followed by a ridge walk then a descent to the James River. At the top of one of the climbs, I met a french girl named ""Peace Walker"". We conversed a while then I headed on to find a spot to have lunch and dry out my gear. While sitting there eating, ""Peace Walker"" came down the trail totally engrossed in thought and didn't see me until the last minute. This, of course, scared her which humored both of us. It was amazing she didn't notice me there because my brightly colored gear was hanging from the trees. While there, ""Dakota"", ""Wild Flower"" and ""Goldfish"" passed by.

He also mentioned going into Glasgow and staying. He said there was a shelter set up by the city for hikers that was free. That got my wheels turning. It would be easier and quicker for ""Morning Glory"" to pick me up there. I'd get home faster too. Seemed like a win for both of us. I packed everything up and headed down toward the road crossing and the river. I caught up with ""Still Bill' a couple of miles before the river and we hiked together all the way to the road. The three young folks where at the river's edge enjoying the dip in the water. I joked with them that we (""Still Bill"" and I) were better looking and would get a hitch faster than them.

The foliage was still coming out on the trees do the mountain sides were a blend of green and brown. I finally got to the top and found a spot to have lunch. It was so early and the distance to the shelter short that I just laid down to take a nap. I was tired from all of the travel and my stomach was a little upset from the bad diet I had the day I drove back. The rest helped a lot. I got up and continued on. There was a fairly long downhill to the shelter which definitely stressed my leg. It held up well. I really believe it's healed. I got to the shelter a little before dinner, set up my new tent and got all housekeeping chores done. The tent is big. I like the openness of the inside. I made dinner and talked with folks at the shelter. I still very tired so I went back to the tent and went to sleep.","Rest day - head to Buena Vista

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562491,"I slept extremely well last night. All of the driving and other activities finally caught up to me. I woke a little layer than normal, refreshed and ready to hike. Today's goal was to get to US 60 to get picked up by my friend Craig. Getting there too early meant that I would wait for them at the road crossing longer. 
After taking care of my normal morning chores, I was heading down the trail. I had forgotten how close the Blue Ridge Parkway was to the shelter. It was only 0.4 miles on the trail. There were a couple of short hills before heading down to a flatter stretch that ran along the river. After moving along the river, I got to the camping area for the shelter to have lunch. I remembered this spot from my 2011 hike. I camped here and enjoyed dipping my feet in the river. 
While eating lunch and just relaxing, a guy came up to join me for lunch. It turned out to be ""Stealth"". I had not seen him since Hot Springs. We has lots to talk about. We got caught up on what was going on with our hike, how we were doing and how our mutual friends were doing. It was a great treat to see him again. 
After eating lunch, we headed for the road crossing. Once there, he headed for the next shelter since he had already spent time in Lexington with his wife. I headed for a picnic table in the shade to wait for Craig. While there, I got my trail journal updated. It took a while for Craig to get there which was fine. I was enjoying the time to relax. I also chatted with some other thru-hikers who stopped for a break before continuing to the next shelter. One thru-hiker wanted to go to town so he waited for Craig to come by. 
Once he was there, we loaded up and headed to civilization. Craig dropped off the other hiker in Buena Vista then headed to his place. I showered then we headed to town for dinner. It was then back to their place for a few beers and socializing. We ended up staying up late but had a great time.","Punchbowl Shelter

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564453,"had a great time visiting and being hosted by my friends Craig and Tonia. Today, I decided to push the miles back to what I was doing before my leg injury. It's a test of my leg but I feel confident that I'm ready. 
The climb from US 60 is a long one but not too difficult. I just took my time getting up to the top. This climb gets the trail up to a ridgeline that eventually goes to the Priest. That peak I'll tackle tomorrow. At the intersection of the first shelter, I decided not to go there for water because it was so far off the trail. I had enough to get to the next shelter. It would be barely enough, but I knew I'd be fine. 
I eventually got to Salt Log Gap where there was a parking area that the many day hikers used to get access to the trail. There were a lot of folks out hiking towards US 60. Across the road, there was a group of hikers under a tree escaping the hot sun. I decided that I would join them for lunch. 
As I approached, I heard my name yelled out. It was ""Haiku"" and ""Wick"" who I hadn't seen since before Hot Springs. After hugs we sat down and got caught up on how our hikes had been going. It was great to see them again. I got water at a spring nearby instead of waiting for the shelter. After waiting for the hottest part of the day to pass, we headed out. As it turned out, we both had the same ending point. 
The weather has been quite hot over the last couple of days and it seems to be a little hotter each day. This is very unusual for this time of year. The terrain isn't that difficult but the heat just seemed to zap my energy. ""Haiku"" and ""Wick"" also seemed to be getting tired. They started at the shelter before the road crossing so they had hike almost two miles more than I did. 
We got the water source at Rock Spring to get the water we would need to camp at Spy Rock. There isn't a spring there so any water that is needed had to be carried. As we hiked to our destination, the ridge to our left started looking real good. They wanted to get to Spy Rock to camp so that we could eat dinner on top. Once at the road, we saw the climb up to the rock. At that point, ""Haiku"" decided that where we were was fine. The road wasn't heavily traveled so there wasn't any concern about locals showing up. We found a couple of spots and called it a day. I was very happy with the day's hike because my leg had no pain. Didn't even need to take pain medication. It gave me more confidence about how much it had healed.","US 60 Buena Vista

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564455,"Today, we were going to tackle both the Priest and Three Ridges. Both are tough climbs. With my leg so feeling good, I felt I was ready. 
We got up, did the usual morning routine and headed out. We climbed up to Spy Rock camping area, dropped our packs and climbed up to the top of the rock. It was an easy rock scramble to go up that offered a great view. After soaking it in for a while, we continued toward our first climb, the Priest. Going north, it really isn't a bad climb. Most of work was done climbing from US 60.
Before the summit, we arrived at the Priest Shelter where there's a trail tradition of writing silly confessions in the shelter log. It's amusing to read these. There are some creative hikers out there that have a great sense of humor. Two hikers,  ""Scooby Do"" and ""JC Penny"" joined us for our break. After writing an entry in the shelter log, we headed out. The summit of the Priest wasn't too far past the shelter. The view of the valley was great. Off in the distance, we could see our next climb,  Three Ridges Mountain. From the top of the Priest, it was a long downhill to the Tye River. We dropped 3000 feet in about four miles. That sort of descent is hard on the legs. We were a little sore when we got to the river. It was about lunchtime so having lunch in the shade down by the river was appealing. ""Wick"" jumped in but came right back out because the water was cold. I was content to just sit there and enjoy lunch in the cool breeze. We stayed there to avoid the hottest part of the day as we did yesterday. ""Fox"" came by with a bag of bacon he from a day hiker. We all enjoyed that little treat. 
As we started heading out, we met a trail crew who were scouting the trail in preparation for a work trip the next weekend. They gave us a couple of snacks which was very nice. We started the climb up to the top of Three Ridges. It was 3000 feet up the mountain with one break along the way. The heat was almost unbearable. I drank water to try to stay ahead of my thirst. We got to the shelter that was part way up, got some water then continued on. The shelter was full of people who were out for the weekend. It included a boy scout troop that pretty much filled up one of the camping areas. I was glad that we were not stopping there for the night.
When we started back up, it was still hot but not as bad as when we started. I had dipped my shirt in the creek which cooled me for a little while. The climb took a long time. I figured we would arrive at the top around 5:30. That was two hours of climbing on fairly steep grade. We were told that there was a spring near the top. Given how hot it was and how tired we were getting, that gave us the option to camp on top of the mountain. We found the spring and decided to camp there instead of going to the next shelter. We were concerned that the shelter would be full of people who were out for the weekend. 
After getting water and hiking up a little further, we found a couple of great spots that had a view of the Priest Mountain. We made camp, had dinner with a great view and after talking for a while, turned in for the night.","Spy Rock Rd

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564456,"After the tough climb up to the top of Three Ridges, the thought if a shorter day sounded great. Visiting the brewery also sounded good. 
I got up and packed and had breakfast. After ""Wick"" and ""Haiku"" got packed we headed for the road crossing. Where we camped was a couple of tenths of a mile from the top so we had to do a little bit of climbing before we stayed the descent. There was another spot at the very top where there were tent spots but they were taken. Given that, the place we stayed was the best choice. 
The descent down was a little bit technical until we got down off the mountain. We got to the shelter for a break. There were several folks there who were finishing their weekend backpacking trip. They were also heading to the road crossing. I asked them if they would give us a ride over to the brewery and after a short discussion, they agreed. The brewery gives rides back to the trail so the ride situation was taken care of. 
Once at the road, we figured out the seating arrangement and headed down the mountain to the brewery. Once there, we thank our drivers and went over to have breakfast. Second breakfast of course. We then went over to the camping area and set up our tents. We later had lunch then took a much needed nap. Afterwards, we went back to have dinner. We ate at all three of the restaurants and had breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was a fun accomplishment. The heat of the day became the heat of the night. It was difficult to fall asleep because of it. Eventually, it chilled off enough and I got tired enough to fall asleep.","Top of Three Ridges @838.0

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564459,"Being nearly out of food, it was important to get to Waynesboro for a resupply. It was going to be a long day especially given that it would take a little time to get to the trail. 
We got up and packed early so we could be ready to have breakfast when the restaurant opened at 7. This also got our tents packed up before the rain which was due at any moment. While ordering breakfast, we arranged for a shuttle back to the trail at 8 which gave us plenty of time to eat. This is a free service provided by the brewery. The driver was one of the maintenance guys who was tapped to bring us back. He was great to talk to dine he had a lot of knowledge about the brewery and the effects of the recent buyout.
Once back on the trail, we started making our way toward the road crossing for Waynesboro. ""Haiku""s dad was going to give us a ride into town. I figured we would get there somewhere around 6 given we didn't start until 8:30. We couldn't waste a lot of time because of the distance. Fortunately, the temperatures were going to be much cooler because of the rain. That meant we didn't feel the need to avoid the heat after lunch by taking an extended break. Of course, the rain started shortly after we were on the trail. It never rained hard during the morning. The clouds move in and out giving us some views along the way. Cedar Bluffs gave us a wonderful view of the valley. 
Once we made it to the top of Humpback Mountain, we enjoyed the faster pace of a long downhill. The rest of the hike was in the woods without much in the way of views. There were wildflowers to enjoyed instead. Earlier in the day, we came across a patch of Trilliums both white and pink. 
We stopped at the shelter for a quick lunch. There were a fair number of section hikers there who were enjoying a swim in the stream in front of the shelter. While we were eating, it began to rain hard. There was also lightening and thunder. I looked at the weather on my phone to see the storm pattern. The current rain storm didn't look like it would last that long so we waited it out. We had to move quickly after it passed because there was a bigger one right behind it. It looked as if it would arrive fairly close to when we would get to the road crossing. 
Once the storm passed, we headed toward our final destination. We were moving at a quick pace to try to beat the next storm. We did stop long enough to look at the chimney ruins that was mentioned in the guidebook. Other than that, we just hiked. ""Haiku"" picked up the pace a little so she got to the road crossing first. ""Wick"" and I weren't to far behind. Other than a couple of sprinkles, we beat the storm. We got into the car and it was off to town to dry out and shower. I stayed at a hotel downtown because it had access to all of the places I needed to go. ""Haiku""s dad dropped me off. After we were all cleaned up, ""Haiku""s dad picked me up and we all went to get dinner. Since it was Monday night, Ming Garden want open so we had to go elsewhere for dinner. Afterwards, I was dropped off at the hotel and after taking care of some great related things, I called it a night.","Reeds Gap

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564460,"Since I got in late yesterday, there wasn't any time to do the normal town chores. So the first part of the day was dedicated to resupply, laundry, etc. One of these chores was switching out to summer gear. That required a trip to the post office to pick up the summer gear then another to ship back the winter gear. After that was done, I headed to the grocery store to get food for the next stretch. It was a little tricky because the plan was to eat at the waysides in the park. I decided to get four days of food which I knew would get me to Luray where I could get more if needed. 
After getting my food I packed up and left the hotel to do laundry. I changed into my rain gear so that everything could get washed. There was a bathroom there where I could change. After laundry was done, I went to a CVS to buy KT for blister care and a set of shoe laces. I tried to buy new shoes in town but the outfitter there didn't carry the shoe I liked. So I replaced the laces which were about to break completely so that I could keep hiking with the shoes I had until new ones could be bought. 
I replaced the laces outside the store so I could throw away the old ones in the trash can there at the store. While there, a guy by the name of Denny came up and started talking with me about my hike. It wasn't long before he offered me a ride to the otherside of town. That would get me closer to the trail so I accepted. 
While driving through town, he said that he would just take me all the way to the trail. It was awesome how it worked out. I was on the trail by 1pm with all of my town related stuff done. I didn't have far to go to the shelter so I got there pretty early in the afternoon. I got a tent spot, setup and went to the shelter to talk with folks who were already there. ""Cheap Glasses"" who I met at Woods Hole Hostel was there as well as a lady I passed along the trail a couple of weeks ago. There were several others there whom I hadn't met.

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564462,"I was tempted to do a 26.2 mile day like I did on my first thru-hike but thought it best to not push things and get hurt again. I need more time before I'm sure the leg is healed up. I decided to go for the campground at Loft Mountain.

I set out with a little extra water since it wasn't readily available for a while. The initial part of the hike was pretty mundane. There was just one spot that had a view, Sawmill Run Overlook where the trail crossed Skyline Dr. After getting up the first big climb, I started encountering lots of rocks. They were the sharp, jagged ones. I looked in the book and realized that I was heading to the Riprap parking area. I began to realize that the area earned its name from the rocks. 
I stopped at the parking area fir lunch along with a southbound  section hiker who had a dog. We talked while eating then went our separate ways after lunch. Once I got to Blackrock Hut, I got more water sobe the next stretch was also fairly dry. It wasn't real hot but I just didn't want to run out. The hut was on the climb up to Blackrock. I finally got up to where the trail skirts the mountain and took in some great views of the valley.
After enjoying the views for a while, I headed down the trail to my destination. Eventually, I got to the side trail that went into the campground. I took the first campsite I came to. Before setting up, I explored the campground to make sure that was a good spot. I was fairly close to a bathhouse and water so I went back and set up my tent. I made dinner and just took it easy before getting in the sleeping bag. It was a long day but a good one.","Calf Mountain Shelter

Sparky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564464,"The original plan was to stay at Hightop Hut but the weather report showed heavy rains on their way. I decided to hike to the road crossing for Elkton and stay at the hotel. It's expensive but camping in heavy rains with lightening is not my idea of a good time. 
I got up a little early to have breakfast at the Loft Mountain Wayside. I wanted to get there when they opened at 7. After a quick snack, I was on my way. It was about 2.5 miles to the side trail from where I camped. Given I didn't get going right away, I didn't arrive until about quarter to eight. Once there, I discovered that they opened at 9. Didn't read the guidebook correct. It was either hang out in camp or at the wayside. There was a couple who also got there early thinking it opened early. We did our best to stay warm while we waited. 
We wasted no time getting in and ordering once they opened. After a nice breakfast, I ordered a blackberry milkshake to start the Shenandoahs milkshake challenge. I hung out for a while to let my food digest before heading out. 
The hike from the wayside was just the green tunnel that the AT is known for. There were many flowers along the way and the trees had compete foliage fir the most part. Only trees at the highest elevations were still developing their leaves. 
I started pushing the pace to beat the rain. It was going to be a good test of my leg since there was a fairly long downhill to the highway. By the time I got to the hut that at which I had originally planned to stay, the clouds were rolling in. I stopped at the side trail to the hut to have a snack then finished the climb to the top of Hightop Mountain. It was around there that the couple I had breakfast with caught up to me. They were going to hike about 17 miles beyond the Elkton road crossing because they had to meet family in two days. I knew they were in for a rough night of hiking in the heavy storm. 
They pulled ahead of me and out of sight. I continued my hike down the hill and finally got to the road that lead to Elkton. Given the distance and pace, I was tired. I hiked past the ranger station and to the road to hitch a ride. There was a lot of traffic but no one stopped. It was a major highway and I think there wasn't enough time for them to decide to stop and make the stop. I felt a couple of rain drops so I headed back to ranger station where I could stay dry and try to hitch a ride from folks leaving the park. The lady at the station told me that she would give me a ride if I hadn't gotten one by the time she was done with her shift. Once under the overhang, it started raining hard. I had successfully out run the rain! 
After a short while, a couple with a baby stopped to give me a ride. They were heading that direction so it was perfect. I sat in the back next to the baby who stared at me the whole time. It was like she trying to figure out so I was. One at the hotel, I showered and ordered a pizza. I wrote a trail journal entry and had to quit. I was too tired to do another. I feel bad that I'm so behind but I've gotten so tired at the end of the day that writing then is hard.","Loft Mountain Campground
