Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555323,Temperature was in the 50's today and I had the time so I decided to take a hike on a local trail. The trail is not strenuous but it is good exercise. I walked for five miles with my backpack loaded to 20 pounds. Hope to do more of this before I head for Springer Mountain. Every little bit helps.,,View Entry,"Feb 27, Mon",0
Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555428,Trying to decide which backpack to use. I have a choice between the Exos 58 and the Mariposa 60. Both backpacks feel really comfortable when carrying 20 lbs. I know I'll be carrying more than 20 lbs but that's the weight I've been training with. The Mariposa fits better but both packs wear really well. I hope to have the weight of my pack around 15 lbs without food and water.Walked for one mile yesterday and three miles today. Hope to go to the YMCA tomorrow.I will have most of the same gear that I used in 2014. To see that gear go to 2014 AT and click the gear button on the left side of the screen. You can also see the gear list on my 2014 AT entry on Pre Hike 6.,,View Entry,"Mar 01, Wed",0
Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555497,The weight of quitting your hike weighs more than your backpack ever will and you will hike with that weight the rest of your life. Katahdin is only 2189.8 miles. Have you gave your best effort to complete your hike? If you have then rest easy my friend. The long distance hike of the AT is not for everyone.The mountains are the marrow of the world. They are some of God's finest sculpturings.-Del Gue,,View Entry,"Mar 03, Fri",0
Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555645,"I did the approach trail on my 2010 hike and I may do it again this year. Have not decided yet. If I do I will have to count on another day of food before my resupply. That would make a 4 day food supply to carry rather than a 3 day. First resupply will be at Neels gap. No plans to carry a stove at the beginning but will have it sent to me when needed. If I need mail drops I will try to plan ahead and send my own mail drops from one town to the next.Breakfast in the beginning will be pop tarts, oatmeal, honey buns and bagels.For lunch I will be snacking during the day with trail mix, snickers, nuts, energy bars, M & M's, etc.Supper will be some type of sandwich. Tortilla's with tuna or chicken or peanut butter or honey. Whatever makes a good spread. Maybe ritz crackers with tuna.In town I will try to eat healthy to make up for my trail diet. When I leave town I will carry something that is good to eat for that first day.",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Sun",0
Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556762,Start date is approaching fast. I still plan to start April 1. I hope the cold weather that all the hikers are experiencing now will all be gone by the time I get there. Trying to decide if I want to carry a camera or just use my phone for taking pictures. My camera is small but heavy. There are so many decisions to be made concerning gear. Hard to decide what to take until you are ready to walk out the door and are forced to make a decision.Have not trained as much as I wanted to. Been walking 3 to 5 miles with a 20 lb pack 2 to 3 times a week. That's not as much as I wanted to do but that will have to do. Maybe I can increase the training between now and April 1.,,View Entry,"Mar 17, Fri",0
Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557970,Decided to leave earlier than planned. Had planned to leave April 1st but didn't want to wait till the weekend. Drove to the Amicalola Park visitors center today and signed in the hiker book at number 1331. After signing in I drove to the lodge and checked into my room. After dinner I took my truck down to the long term parking lot and walked back up to the lodge. Tomorrow I start hiking the approach trail from the lodge. After completing the approach traiI I should get some of the AT done. Met A very nice family here at the lodge today who want to follow my hike. I think her name was Dawn and his was Mike (please forgive me if I'm wrong on the names). I really enjoyed talking to you and thanks for making my day. I would love to have a copy of the picture you took.,,View Entry,"Mar 28, Tue",0
Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558429,"Had a rough start today. Woke up at the lodge and saw that my camera battery was low. Was going to put the backup battery in the camera while charging the other one. Discovered the battery was in my truck at the visitors center. Had to walk down to the visitors center, retrieve the battery and back up to the lodge. Then things got better. Two trail angels I had met yesterday offered to take me to Springer Mt so that I would not have to walk the approach trail. Thank you so much Marcia and Scott. The weather was good today. It was good for hiking although it did get hot about midday (80).The military had the water tank out for hikers which is really good. I drank as much as I could and then filled my water bottles. That's all can I write tonight. I'm tired.","Springer Mountain

I was a little sore but it didn't take long to warm up and work the soreness out. The weatherman was calling for severe thunderstorms starting at 5:00 this afternoon but then moved the start time to 8:00 and now 9:00. Supposed to end at 6:00 in the morning. Not any fun to pack up a wet tent but that's part of backpacking. Good day on the trail. Met a lot of hikers today. I wanted to stay in a shelter tonight because of the rain but the shelter was full. Just finished dinner of tuna, nabs, and a power bar and 2 Advil. I'm tired and ready to go to bed and it's only 7:30. Other than hurting all over I feel pretty good.","Justus Creek

Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558434,Rained really hard all night. Rain started about 9:00 last night and rained till about 6:00 this morning. Got up at 6:30 and headed up the trail for Blood Mt. So foggy at Blood Mt there were no good views so I kept going. Got to Blood Mt cabins and got a cabin for tonight. Sat around the cabin all day resting and eating. Set up my tent and let it dry out and washed my clothes in the sink. Then went to the cabin office where I bought food for the next three days.It was good to rest my legs. Plan to get back on the trail tomorrow and start hiking. Nice hot shower and some food other than trail food was good. Going to watch TV now. Life is good. Hello Dawn and family if you are reading this.,"Slaughter Creek Trail

Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558682,"Left blood mt cabins at 6:30 and was on the trail at 7:00. Weather was great for hiking today. Morning started out foggy but it cleared up. At mile 37.4 (Tesnatee Gap) I was low on water and a nice lady (trail angel)out for a day hike gave me her bottle of water. True trail magic. Thank you if you are reading this journal. At mile 38.3 (Hogpen Gap) Echo Ministries had set up trail magic. I thought I had walked into Kroger's. Never seen so much food and supplies. Fruit, cookies, gloves, tobaggans, nail clippers, reading glasses, etc. They were cooking hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill. Had several members there witnessing and praying with the hikers. Truly a blessing. After praying with me and for me I moved on up the trail. About a mile past low gap shelter (mile 42.9) stopped and got more water from a nice little water fall. Thought about stopping at Chattahooche Gap (mile 47.9) for the night but moved on. Finally arrived at Blue Mt Shelter (50.2) and decided to call it a day. Lots of hikers here tonight. Good day today. To God be the glory.","Neel Gap

Everyone making plans to get to a shelter in case storms start earlier. We also want to get near Top of Georgia Hostel (69.3) tonight so we get up early in the morning and get to that hostel or get a shuttle into town and be out of the storm. I got to Tray mt. Shelter (58.3) and was so tired I had to stop and eat and take about a 30 minute break. Decided I didn't want to be at that shelter during the storm and I moved on. Reached the top of Kelly Knob (64.9) and was just beat. The hardest climb of the trip so far to me. Had to lay down about 30 minutes before continuing on. Got to Deep Gap Shelter (65.7) where I was trying to get to, so I could be out of the storm. I had a little daylight left so decided to push on to Dicks Creek Gap (69.3), where I could hopefully go to Top of Georgia Hostel a half mile down the highway or hitch a ride into town before the storm comes. No luck on the hitch so I walked a half mile down the highway. Arrived at hostel just as they were closing. One minute later they would have been closed. They had one bunk left for the night. Thank God. I was so tired. After 2 hotdogs and a hot shower things were good. Going to bed now in the stinkyest bunk room I've ever slept in but I don't care. It's not the hostels fault it stunk so bad but a hiker who I don't think has had a bath in a week. Storm coming tonight but I'm safe in a stinky hostel. Goodnight.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Weather man calling for rain, hail, and high winds today. I have to be out of the hostel by 10:00. Dee, another hiker managed to get some of us a shuttle into town where we could wait out the storm. I'm here at the Holiday Inn where I plan to take a zero day (no miles hiked). Plan to stay here today and hit the trail tomorrow. Went to Daniels restaurant today twice where it is buffet style. Good food. Had to make a trip to the post office to mail some things home I was not using. Don't want to carry the weight if you're not using it. Then went to the grocery store to resupply for the next three days. After that back to the hotel to wash clothes. Time to rest now before going to bed and hitting the trail tomorrow","Dicks Creek Gap

Good breakfast of eggs, sausage, orange juice, biscuit, cinnamon roll, pancakes, waffle and a bowl of cereal. Just can't get enough to eat. My friend Charlie got us an 8:00 ride back to the trail. Too much breakfast. It took me about 2 hours to get going. Crossed into North Carolina around lunch time. Goodbye Georgia. North Carolina welcomes you with a hard climb up Courthouse Bald. Started to stay at Muskrat shelter (81.1) but decided to push on. Around 5:30 I arrived at Standing Indian shelter (86) and decided to stay there for the night. Calling for rain tomorrow morning starting at 9:00 and a cold front moving in bringing snow. I plan to get up early and start hiking so I can get near town and possibly avoid the snow.

Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559036,Woke up at 5:15 this morning. On the trail hiking at 5:45. Used my headlamp to see where I was going for the first hour or so. Trying to get to Franklin today to avoid the rain tonight and possible snow tomorrow. Came upon two hikers today with two dogs. The dogs didn't seem to care for me. Both dogs came running toward me and I put my hiking sticks in front of me to protect myself from the dogs. The biggest dog stopped but the little dog ran behind me and bit me on the back of the leg. The owners felt bad that it happened and were very apologetic. Luckily it didn't break the skin. Started raining at lunch time and continued to rain the rest of the day. Lightning and thunder were very scary as I walked along the ridges of the mts. But I kept hiking trying to get to a shelter or town before the bad storm tonight. Crossed the 100 mile mark today at Albert Mt. Wanted to climb the fire tower there but it was too foggy to see anything. Reached Rock Gap Shelter (105.7) at 1:45 and continued on. Was told there was a shuttle picking hikers up at 3:45 at rock gap (105.8). Figured if I could get to Winding Stair Gap (109.5) by 3:30 I could get on that shuttle. I arrived there at 3:28 and the shuttle pulled about 2 minutes later. I had gotten a ride into town. After hiking 23.5 miles I was going to be out of the storm tonight.

Zip Code,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559068,"Had a good night of sleep after a long day. Up at 6:45 this morning so I could catch the 7:15 shuttle to First Baptist Church, where they fix a free, all you can eat breakfast for the hikers. Pancakes with all the toppings, bacon, and different juices along with coffee. While you eat a church member gives a short sermon. They take your picture and give you a card and envelope to mail the picture and card home. You address it and they mail it for you. After breakfast they shuttle you back to where they picked you up. Spent the rest of the day getting ready to go back to the trail (washing clothes, resupply on food, planning my next few days hike). AT&T phone service is of no use on the trail. I can never get a signal. Most people use Verizon with no problem at all. You really need the phone service to call for shuttles, make reservations, emergencies, and to call home. That's all for today. To Marcia and Scott who signed my trail book guest entry: I didn't have your email address so I wanted to use my journal to say thank you for signing my book and getting this journey off to a good start.

After breakfast I caught the 9:00 shuttle back to the trail to continue north. Started hiking from Winding Stair Gap (109.5) with no plan as to where to stop today. Very muddy trail today. At one point I thought I had taken the wrong trail. Didn't want to backtrack because it would have been all uphill. Finally discovered I was on the right trail. Came to Wayah Bald stone tower (119.6) with some fantastic views. It was starting to turn really cold and I decided to stop at Cold Spring Shelter (125.3). Couldn't get in the shelter because it was full but I did find a campsite not far from it. Need to get in my tent fast because I'm freezing. I have all of my clothes on and I'm still cold.

Probably a little colder outside the tent and the wind was blowing about 20 mph with gusts even higher. Did not want to get out of the sleeping bag this morning. Finally got up and started packing to hit the trail. Hands were so cold they hurt. Started hiking as soon as I could so I could warm up. The top of my right foot is hurting when I climb up. Hope that goes away. Been hurting for two days now. The knuckles on my right hand were hurting this morning also. Maybe arthritis. It was a good hike after I got warmed up. Mostly down hill today. Deb called ahead to the NOC and got me a room. We are hoping if I rest my foot maybe it will stop hurting plus after being so cold this morning I look forward to being warm tonight. There are so many hikers out here (record number I've been told) it seems that every shelter on the trail is full when you get there and all the hostels in town are full. Thanks to my wonderful wife I have a warm place tonight. There were so many hikers in Franklin I couldn't even get to a washing machine to wash my clothes. That's it for today.

Hikers call it a zero day but if you're at the NOC I call it a vacation day. Plan to do nothing but rest and eat. Had a good day today doing nothing. My foot feels better and I'm ready to head north tomorrow. Planning my food resupply for the Great Smokies is a little tricky but I'll figure it out. There are so many hikers out here and not one hiker past me yesterday. I only seen one hiker on the trail all day while doing 11.7 miles.

Top of right foot started to hurt after about an hour and left calf started to cramp. Had to do stretches several times today. Arrived at Stecoah Gap to find trail magic. Apples, bananas, and crackers. Before I left a lady showed up to cook hotdogs. She also brought Pepsi, ice and cups. I had the Pepsi and ice but didn't wait for the hotdogs as I had been there awhile before she came. Today was the hardest climb I've had to make on the trail. It's at mile 151.4 (Jacobs Ladder). Arrived at Brown Fork Gap Shelter and had to fill up my water bottles as I was almost out. Thought about staying there but decided to move on.

Had breakfast at the hostel (not much of an appetite) and then was shuttled to Fontana Dam. Started hiking at 8:30. Not feeling a 100% today. I was able to FaceTime my family today about 3 miles into the smokies and show them the views I was seeing. It was good to see them. Took the side trail to Shuckstack fire tower (170.5) and wanted to climb it but not feeling well at all. Not sure I would climb it if I was feeling good. It's a long way up and my balance is not what it used to be. Arrived at Mollies Ridge Shelter (mile 177) and laid down for about 30 minutes (sick). It was too early to stop for the day so I decided to push on to Russell Field Shelter. Have not eat much all day and didn't eat dinner tonight. Thoughts tonight are that maybe I'm done with this hike. I'm sick and homesick. Diarrhea, stomach cramps, no appetite, weak and feeI as if I will throw up. Will make a decision in the morning after a good nights sleep as to whether to continue or to go home. A hiker friend of mine (Cruiser) offered to cook me a hot meal but I turned it down.

Finally made it back to the Fontana visitors center where I got a shuttle to the lodge. My truck is at Amicalola so I called my wife to tell her I was going to get someone to shuttle me there. She said my brother and her were already on the way to Fontana to pick me up and take me to my truck. While waiting for them (5 hour drive) thought I would try to eat something. Still no appetite. Went to the Wildwood Grill and ran into my friend Charlie who was a day behind me on the trail. He was my hiking buddy whom I had spent most of my time with on the trail. I told Charlie I was going home and he looked really surprised. Hated to leave him. He is a good friend and a joy to hike with.
