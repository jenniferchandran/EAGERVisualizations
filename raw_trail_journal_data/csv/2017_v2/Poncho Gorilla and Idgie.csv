Poncho Gorilla and Idgie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481137,"Sitting in the house in Western Kentucky contemplating whether to continue my plan to retire in January 2017 and start the hike in March 2017 or retire in January 2016 and hike in 2016. Financially, I can afford to do it but know that another year of solid pay can make a big difference. The other thing I think about is free standing tent or not free standing. Since my wife will be hiking with me, we can share weight if need be. Choices are Big Agnes Fly Creek or Zpacks Duplex. A close friend of mine who completed the PCT in 2014 says the decision is a no brainer. He says you cannot go wrong with Zpacks. I have a hangup because I have never had a NFS tent and worry about not being able to stake down on rocky ground. Last item, I go back and forth on is the type of stove. I currently have a pocket rocket and a caldera. Have given thought to Jet Boil as well. Leaving for a 4 mile hike in a 1/2 hour on this unseasonably warm February morning.

Poncho Gorilla and Idgie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481159,"I am driven by goals. It seems if I do not have a goal, I am not a pleasant person to be around. That criticism comes from my wife of 30 plus years. She is absolutely correct. I have a number of goals from thru hiking the AT to self contained bicycling across the USA via the trans american route. The conflict I have with my goals is tearing away from my high school cross country team coaching. It is a job that I take pride in and love trying to influence young men to push themselves during a race. I just need to retire or my goals will not get accomplished!",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Sat",0
Poncho Gorilla and Idgie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481163,My wife and I went on a 4 mile hike out the front door with loaded packs. Mission was to hike some hills and stop for a cup of tea heating the water with the caldera cone stove. All went as planned. Our 2 cairn terriers enjoyed the walk as well. I like the stove but am not totally in love with it (yet). Still debating the pros/cons of alcohol stoves.,"

Poncho Gorilla and Idgie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483861,"It has been a good training week for both of us. I got back in the pool to swim laps after a 2 year absence. Also, I made it to spinning class for 2 sessions and some weight lifting. Idgie walked or ran each morning. Additionally, we hiked 5 miles last Sunday and 7 miles today with packs that weigh 15 lbs. At the half way mark, I get out the Caldera Cone Stove and we brew a couple cups of tea and have some food. I am getting to really like this stove setup. The great thing about daylight savings time is being able to get some time to walk around our 30 acre field with the dogs after supper each evening. The temperatures have been great and spring is a great time of the year. Be Safe, Poncho and Idgie",,prep hike,"Mar 15, Sun",0

However, on the return trip, we are going to Georgia! We are going to stay one night at Hiker Hostel and hike from Woody Gap to Neel Gap. this will be another step towards our goal. To many, this hike may be a light weight way of prepping for a thru hike. However, to us it is the first of many steps.

It was pouring down rain for the first 2 hours but our shower pass rain gear worked to perfection. We ate lunch at Gooch Mountain Shelter. We made our way in the afternoon to Lance Creek where we camped for the night. Total distance for the day was 12 miles. There were approximately 20 tents that were in the area.The next morning we left camp and headed up Blood Mountain. It was a great hike with beautiful weather and views. We left camp at 8:00 AM and arrived at Neel Gap at 1:00. This included hanging out at Blood Mountain Shelter for an hour. We were picked up by Derrick from Hiker Hostel and taken back to our car. Total Distance for Day 2 was a a little over 7 miles. My pack weight with food, water and all gear was 22 lbs. Idgie was carrying 17 lbs. Overall, it was a great time.

As we returned to the park, there were literally hundreds of people everwhere. It was a madhouse with tour buses and cars parked everywhere. It took a long time to get down the steps because of all the spectators. We climb back into the car and drove 350 miles home. After a quick supper of fast food, water and a Italian Roast from Starbucks, the miles went quick. We are still discussing our tent options. I got it narrowed to three.

Big decision still lingering is which tent. It is now narrowed down to the Double Rainbow or MSR Freelite 2. I am waiting for the Freelite to hit the stores so I can take a closer look at the tent. In the meantime, we continue to put the miles in when we have the time. We have given some thought to using Hiker Hostel for the first 7 days to get thru Georgia. I have a number of reason of giving it some thought: 1. Keeps the mileage low initially. 2. Anticipating early start in March, this will provide an acclimation and flexibility to the weather conditions. I just turned 59 and Idgie will be 56 on January 1, we try to be prudent and intelligent about our research and preparation.","

Poncho Gorilla and Idgie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520840,"Idgie and I went to the Land Between the Lakes (LBL) for the weekend for some tent camping and hiking. Overnight low was 27 degrees. The temp definitely tested our sleeping bags. The daytime temps were in the fifty's and we were able to get in some good miles with a few hills. LBL is an under utilized area in my opinion with fantastic facilities and decent trails.For $30, one can buy a back country camping permit that allow you to tent or trailer camp in approximately a dozen beautiful areas. The permit is good for one year. Most of the camp sites are lakefront or lake view.Lessons learned were many but the most important thing learned was dealing with the cooler weather. Idgie did do a face plant after getting a branch caught between her legs. Her new ULA Pack appeared to flip her over after she hit the ground. I was unsure how to react when she hit the ground. I quickly offered to help her up and thankfully she was unhurt. Tomorrow, I get a new tent delivered by UPS. I hope after months of research the tent lives up to my expectations. If I like it, I will post picture tomorrow.","prep hike

Poncho Gorilla and Idgie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521523,"So, I think that we have finally selected our tent. I bought a Shires Double Rainbow. I have set it up 4 times and get quicker and better at it each time. We have yet to camp in it due to other obligations at work for me. It seems very roomy and I think it will work great. The Double Rainbow is a single wall tent. I have never owned one. It may take awhile to get used to but if it doesn't leak, I will appreciate the lower weight difference. Idgie is in Arizona visiting grandchildren while I am home taking care of cairn terriers and getting in some training hikes. 12 months from now, I hope to be within 2 weeks of starting this incredible epic journey. Meantime the research continues while waiting for some winter hiking clothes to come on sale. Be Safe! Poncho","

Trail a little soggy but it was really in great shape.We placed Subway Sandwich bags over our socks and then wore our Brooks Cascadia's on the trail. The bags did a great job. This kept our socks and feet from getting wet. We try to stop every hour and rest for 10 minutes. Pace was very steady with a number of geese, deer, ducks and 3 snakes all as added scenery. Total mileage was 8 miles. We will add 6.5 miles tomorrow with full packs. I sent my Double Rainbow tent back and will be purchasing the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2. This will be my second time owning the Copper Spur. I did not like the height of the bathtub floor on the Rainbow. I was afraid of splash back if the weather was extremely nasty and raining. I did not like the added weight but I need to have complete confidence in the integrity of a tent from rain and moisture. I am not sure when all the research on gear will stop.

We departed the trailhead Saturday morning at 8:30 AM and arrived at the campground at 5:00 PM. After showers and dinner, we reversed our course the next morning and departed at 7:30 AM and reached the car at 3:30 PM. What did we learn? First, I am so happy that we hung our food bags in a bear free area because the raccoon's were plentiful. They were unable to get our food. As I was hanging the ZPacks food bags, I am sure the 5th wheel trailer occupants thought I was crazy. During the evening, I was awoken by raccoon's making a failed attempt.Second lesson: A Ghost Whisperer Jacket makes a better pillow than a camping pillow. Third Lesson- I took both Aquamira Water Treatment and a Sawyer Mini. I prefer the Aquamira at this stage in my hiking career probably due to a time issue of not squeezing. I took 2 one quart smart water bottles and when I would get one nearly empty, I would fill it and treat it. Fourth lesson: Our butts are dragging right now. We probably at this stage of our training are only good for 10 mile days not 14.5. However, we feel great about the miles. It is like adding money to the bank!

We bought Therma-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm (R) which weighs in at 15 ounces but more importantly has an R Value of 5.7.

I could cut a pound and a few ounces by going with a zpacks arc blast but will stay with my ULA OHM. Have a great day!",,Torn Meniscus,"Jan 27, Fri",0
Poncho Gorilla and Idgie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555052,Plans have changed. I had a cortisone shot last week. It did very little to alleviate pain. I went to a orthopedic specialist this afternoon. The MRI showed a complex tear of meniscus. The doctor said that he would like to do surgery next Wednesday. He said full recovery would be around 30 days. We now plan to do a flip flop hike. Any recommendations on start location would be appreciated. We are looking at getting started around the first week of April.,"Prep

Poncho Gorilla and Idgie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555565,I had surgery on March 1. It was a partial meniscectomy. I am icing frequently and have been walking in the house. Some swelling is still present. I can feel daily improvement and caution myself not to over do it. I am still cautiously optimistic for a start this month on the trail. We will do a flip flop if able to get on trail. I have received great advice from a couple of people on potential starting locations. It is greatly appreciated.,"Home
