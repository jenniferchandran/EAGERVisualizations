Oneida,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554769,"A beautiful day today. Hiked with full pack, 26 lbs, on leatherwood loop trail,just 3 miles but up one side of mountain, down the other in BSF park. Very happy with ULA backpack. I also used my life straw bottle to drank water from a creek, and the shewee, (female urinal device), a great invention, can't believe I did not learn about these earlier. Sure beat having to take off pack, and drop pants.","

Oneida,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555024,"I hiked a 4 mile, and a 7 mile loop this week, with full load in my backpack, 26 lbs. I did it in 4 hours, made me really tired. My LlBEAN shoes gave me a few problems in the ""toe box"" area. Hopefully I can get local shoe repair store to stretch them a little wider. I will try to post some pictures. The park is beautiful. I didn't see any bear but did smell a strong animal smell, we have wild boar and bear here. It made my scalp tingle!","

Oneida,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559014,"Off the trail with Slow Feet and her husband Gunny. We have gone a total of 52.9 miles since starting the trail. Lots of hiker friends here at same Hotel,Belmont Inn, Helen Ga. On or off the trail, life is great. We missed the snow on the mountain last night, the rain and cold. I was soaked after hiking in the rain 4/3/17. I learned to change out of wet clothes, while wearing my poncho, to cover my body, and received year's and claps, for being brave, not embarrassed, and smart enough to not be chilled to death. That's shelter support, 18 people in a shelter built for 6. So, 4/4/17. We all hike out in sunshine, to get off mountain before the next storm. Life and hiking is great, dirty,sweaty.","Bull Gap

Oneida,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559185,"We packed up and checked out of the hotel, then the shuttle returned back to the hotel with the hikers they had left with earlier. When a hiker from Maine says the mountain is still to cold and icy to be on the trail and was with that returned group, we decided to do the smart thing and stay put too. So, we check back into the hotel, listen to the Hiker stories of cold, wet misery, thankful to have charge cards, thankful to not be on a time schedule, then took a walk around this beautiful town. Will try to leave again in a.m. on first shuttle at 8:30.","UnicoI Gap

Total miles for AT is 59.8 miles. We are hoping to stay on the trail for 5 days this time. Temp is supposed to drop to low 30's tonight. In tent now, hung food bag, been to the woods for ""cat hole"" time. The most amazing thing happened today. Trail magic in the middle of the woods. The Royal Rangers and Green Mountain Brigade had set up 1700's style camp, cooked food, served the threw hikers. They are a Christian base group. Wonderful experience, especially with all that is going on in the world right now. Good night, happy trails.","UnicoI Gap

Water was a little more difficult to obtain today, had to go off trail .2 & .3 miles to get, steep up and downs all day. Meeting a lot of people since it is weekend. Trail life is still fun. A special thanks to my niece Betty, for moving into my house and taking care of my animals and keeping house safe.","Wolfpen Gap

Her husband had to leave the trail for medical issues. We all made it over Albert Mountain on Easter and had trail magic of candy, Easter eggs, fruit given by a church group on to of the mountain. I was able to walk, not craw, as a lot of people do up that section of mountain. Thanks to the rock scrambles we have in TN, I made it to the NOC, in hotel, Cracey Manor, keeping dry with all the rain. Slow foot will catch up tomorrow.","Deep Gap shelter

A HOSTEL left it there with their card to call for a ride and warm place to stay, so tempted, but hiked instead. Stealth camping about 1.5 miles past the Brown Gap shelter. Rained off and on all day, dry for now. Slow feet pick fresh green, added them to ramen noodles, very good supper, I gave her a packet of spam to add. Yumm!","Stecoah Gap

Try digging a ""cat hole"" in 70 miles winds to take care of morning business!! I left the trail Monday 5/15 with bronchitis,fever,wheezing. I was tx by family Dr. and will go back to the trail tomorrow. No fun being sick. I also decided to get a jetboil for cooking and Coffey. I wake up dreaming that I am looking for a tent site and white blazes.","
