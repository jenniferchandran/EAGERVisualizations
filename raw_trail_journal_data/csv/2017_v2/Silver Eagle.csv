Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554570,"Just getting started--well, at least with the trail journal. A year of planning, reading, chatting, researching, shopping, and praying has brought me here--on the cusp of beginning an adventure that will help me focus more on our Creator God and less on me. I'm looking forward to the experience and sharing special moments with whoever reads my journal.My friend Judy--trail name Hey Jude--and I will take our first steps on the trail on 26 March. We are as ready as we'll ever be. We have the very best kind of gear, the kind that is necessary for survival and doesn't add weight to the backpack. It is the love and support of our children, family, and friends. You guys are awesome!!! I'm sure future entries will be more exciting. I just wanted to get started with the journal. It's about time.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Mon",0
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554877,"They say ""practice makes perfect."" If that's the case, I will be far from the perfect hiker. I will not use that as an excuse to miss my target ""launch"" date--just saying, things might be off to a slower-than-hoped-for start. I was doing really well with hikes up until December 2016--doing a 10-11 mile stretch of the AT near my home with 35 pounds in the pack, diligently recording every detail of every hike--weather conditions, which boots I wore, how much water I drank, and how sore I was afterwards!! Then, holidays, then work, then other things in life seemed to interfere with my efforts. I'm always amazed when I read about hikers who decide one day they are going to hike the AT, and start their adventure the next day. Maybe in my younger days, I would have considered that. Now, I feel there just isn't enough time in the day to get ready. There is a lot more to getting ready for the trail than buying gear and working out. My pre-hike to-do list seems to grow every day. Lining up house sitters, paying bills in advance (including taxes!!), shutting off cable TV, renewing driver's license that will expire while I'm away, updating my will, etc. I expect to get back on the prep track after this week--my last week of work. I'm sure my trail buddy, Hey Jude, will appreciate that.",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Mon",0
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554962,"I was going to do a quick gear review but will save that for the space provided for that purpose. So, this post will be to introduce myself. I know, it's about time I got around to that--it's my third pre-hike entry. If you've read the first two, you may already have your own image of me in your mind. Let's see if it matches who I really am. I'm retired. My children are grown. I live in VA, just minutes away from the AT. I did a fair bit of traveling for work, and managed to carve out time for hiking in the German Alps and the Carpathian Mountains in Romania, although those were only day hikes with minimal baggage and with easy access to escape routes. While in Romania, my dear friend, Robyn Alice McCutcheon, asked if I would consider hiking the AT with her. Not sure how the topic came up, but the more we talked, the more interested I became. Our careers took us in different directions--she remained overseas, and I returned to the States. Even though Robyn instilled the idea, she will not be my hiking buddy for my inaugural AT hike (or attempt). It is my sincere hope to be able to accompany Robyn on her AT adventure when she is in control of her own schedule--i.e. when she retires. For this go, however, my long-time friend from Ohio, Judy--aka Hey Jude--will be my teammate and trail sister. So, one might ask ""why?""  The challenge? my love of nature? Who knows.  I do know, though, that our Lord and Savior will guide me, and he will show me a purpose far greater than any I could ever fathom. I'm an ordinary person, with no real extraordinary skills, but, if God can use me in any way, I am open to it.  Johnny Appleseed just planted seeds--maybe that is all I need to do.I chose to call myself Silver Eagle for several reasons--the ""silver"" represents my age and, not so coincidentally, my hair color (sounded more sophisticated than ""grey"").  The meaning of ""Eagle"" is two-fold:  1) it represents my patriotism.  I love my country--with all it's flaws, it is still the best place to call home.  2) It reflects my belief and hope in Jesus:  ""...those who wait for the Lord will renew their strength, they will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not be weary, they will walk and not faint.""  Is 40:31.  This adventure will be a challenge in every sense of the word--physical, mental, and spiritual. But, thanks to the support of my family and friends, I am ready. Both Hey Jude and I welcome your prayers and invite you to sign our guest book and drop us a line of encouragement. Not sure how often we'll be able to update, but stay tuned...",,Intro,"Feb 21, Tue",0
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555060,"Today is day one of realizing I am not returning to work--at least not for awhile. I will not miss the commute, waking up at zero-dark-thirty, short deadlines, or the pure volume of never-ending, frustration-generating paperwork.I will, however, miss the people--my co-workers, friends, and dare I say my day-time family. I had no idea I had gotten so attached. Now, I have to change my focus. My new job is to check off the remaining items on my pre-hike to-do list and ready my body, soul, and mind for what lies ahead--yes, that means no more Duck donuts or bottomless dish of Lindt truffles. In addition to some of the admin-type things I hope to accomplish today, I plan to re-pack my backpack. Current weight is 36 pounds, and I still want to make room to carry more water. Ultimately, I do not want to exceed 35 pounds. Something has to go.",,Focus,"Feb 24, Fri",0
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555145,"Pretty sad that it is already almost March, and I just took my first real hike of the year today. I've been on short hikes and long walks, but not with a 35-pound backpack, and not with the trekking poles and boots. I think the realization that my launch date is fast approaching was the motivator. It was a cool and breezy start, but I shed my jacket after only a mile and continued with short sleeves and long pants. Of course, I didn't quite make it back before the monsoon came. Luckily, the rolling thunder and ominous skies were my queue to don the rain gear, and I was fully protected just as the first drops started pelting me. I struggled to get the back pack covered--need to work on that a bit, but I was glad the rain pants were loose enough at the bottom to pull over my boots. The jacket and the pants (both Mont Bell) were perfect--kept me dry, and I didn't feel like I was wearing a mobile sauna. My feet stayed dry in my Danner's, too. So, it was a good test run for the rain gear. Seven miles took longer than I hoped it would, but I'll blame the rain.I think winter is pretty much out of the forecast in VA, so I am following the weather reports for Springer Mtn for planning purposes. Not that the weather reports are reliable predictors, but it's all I have right now. It will be interesting to see what my last hike of the year will be like. I hope that entry will be from Katahdin.",,First hike of the year,"Feb 25, Sat",0
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556885,"Went to Ohio last week to pick up my hiking buddy and returned with her and an unwelcomed ""guest""--the flu!! The high fever, chills, general aches and pains, and deep rib-cracking coughing fits knocked me for a loop, and interrupted my plans to visit some family and friends while in Ohio and totally wiped visits in MI off my agenda. Today, after three full days of fever, my temp is back to normal. I hope there is no relapse. I will take a day to rest today and will start to rebuild my energy with short hikes tomorrow. Hey Jude has been a sweetheart of a trail sister, taking care of me, even though she is also recovering from ""the crud."" We are grateful that, if we had to get sick, at least we got sick while we were in familiar surroundings and could get needed medical attention. We conquered our fist challenge.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557964,"This entry covers two days. Pics will come once I figure that out. Day 1 started early yesterday (3/26). It was a longer than expected drive from Anderson, SC to Springer Mountain. Barry, Adrian, and Emily came to see us off. GPS took us on a back road entrance to Springer. Rain and fog added to the already treacherous road conditions. Made it to the Springer Mtn parking lot. A mile hike took us to the official northbound starting point. We signed the register and officially began our AT hike at 11 am. Made it to long Creek falls for day one--short of our goal, but a good rest area. Day 2 was foggy and rainy. Hey Jude was struggling with back pack, so we called it a short day after reaching hawk mountain. Hoping tomorrow will bring new energy. Thanking God for his protection.","First Challenge Conquered--I think
",Hawk Mountain shelter,"Mar 27, Mon",0
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558638,"A lot to catch up on, so the following is a cliff notes version of the last five days. The details of each day may vary, but the overarching message is that this experience overwhelms the senses. There are amazing views at every turn --from the glittering rocks on the paths to the incredible mountain landscapes, from the sweet sounds of mockingbirds to the barking sounds of owls in the clear air. The people are wonderful and so helpful--a real community.so, today, Hey Jude and I are waiting out a storm in Hiawassee GA, about 52 MIles in the trail. 
On Day 3, Hey Jude had to break trail b/c of gear problems. She hitched a ride into Neel's Gap, and I continued pressing on. First solo hike took me up Sassafras and Justus Mountains. I was so grateful God gave me the strength to reach my goal destination of Gooch Mountain Shelter--only 7.7 MI from Hawk Mountain--but they were brutal miles. Fresh spring water meant no filtering--a blessing for this tired soul. Did not sleep well b/c I set up the tent on uneven ground, and I kept rolling into the side of my tent. Woke up to the hooting if owls --sounded like they were arguing!
Lance Creek was my next goal destination. Not as rugged as my previous challenge. I was welcomed by trail magic at Woody Gap. I must have looked like death warmed over when I finally reached camp, b/c two sweet fellow hikers --Joyce and Elki-- set my tent up for me!! Best night's sleep to date, which was needed for the challenge to come--Blood Mountain.
Blood Mountain challenged every part of my being--legs, lungs, ankles, knees. My reward at the top was the incredible views. The reward at the bottom was reuniting with Hey Jude, who greeted me on my arrival at Neel's Gap. We celebrated by spending the night in a cabin, which felt like the Ritz Carlton. We roomed with fellow hikers ""Cheese"" and ""Turtle,"" a sweet young couple whom we met at Hawk Mountain Shelter.
Hey Jude and I lightened our load by returning some unnecessary baggage home--unfortunately, the weight was replaced by a needed resupply of food. We returned to the trail together, met up with ""Trooper"" and reached Hogpen Gap without incident. We tented in a makeshift campsite. The strong winds almost sent us parasailing when we tried to set up the tents. BIll helped us with our bear bags. The night was frigid and the howling winds were relentless, still we heard the sounds of drag racers on the mountainside-- scary to think anyone would take those risks on dark,winding mountain roads.
The trek from Hogpen Gap to Low Gap was short, but Hey Jude's blister was screaming, and it was best to give it a rest. We spent the night at Low Gap Shelter with Skip and Linda--an older couple, each 72 years old, who have been married for 41 years. What a delightful pair. The next day we headed to Unicoi (our current location). It was strenuous, but the thought of a zero day in Hiawassee kept us going. We waited out a storm in a very budget Budget Inn, and plan to hit the trail again tomorrow after Hey Jude's pkg arrives --she had her son send another pair of boots, hoping they will not produce the ugly blisters she got with her current boots. 
Hopefully pictures will follow. Thank you all for your continued orayers, messages of encouragement, and support! Love you!","

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559162,"Hey Jude and I survived the coldest, windiest night yet on the trail. Bitter cold winds cut through all layers of my clothes and my zero degree bag like a hot knife cuts through butter. Tents were covered with snow. The ramp to the privy was ice covered. We were too cold to make a proper breakfast--a mistake that would manifest itself in low energy and weak muscles on the climbs that would lead us to Deep Gap Shelter. Not so cold or windy now. We had a good dinner and we're looking forward to a restful night.

Today's hike was much better for me--of course, I learned my lessons from yesterday--started with a hearty breakfast, kept the calorie count high throughout the day, drank lots of water, and kept a steady pace.

So fun to cross paths with hikers we've seen along the way--shared shelter space with Jason, Herbie, and Quiet Man. Cowboy helped us hang our bear bags, and everyone was bedded down by 6:30.

Our plan was to hike 4 miles to Deep Gap, shuttle into town to resupply, then return to the trail to continue to the next shelter. When we got to Deep Gap, there was no cell service. We asked the driver and passenger of an incoming vehicle if they could take us to town for groceries. It turns out ""town"" was all the way in Franklin. The driver (""bald eagle"") and passenger (Mike) graciously offered to take us there. Realizing it would not be worth it in terms of progress to return to the trail today, we opted to stay in Franklin for the night and return to Deep Gap tomorrow. With Bald Eagle's help, we ended at the lovely Franklin Terrace B&B. While in Franklin, we stopped at the outfitter store, and Hey Jude bought some insoles and a sleeping bag liner, and I bought a mouthpiece for my camelback to replace the one a critter chewed up. We ate lunch at the Lazy Hiker Brewery, and got groceries at Ingles. A short trail day, but overall productive.Thanking God for sending Bald Eagle and Mike to Deep Gap at the very time we needed them. No coincidence, I'm sure.

The climb of about 1000 feet to the summit of Albert Mountain included a 1/3 mile of hand-over hand climbing over car-sized boulders to a summit at 5250 feet. Grueling is an understatement, but reaching the fire tower at the top was truly exhilarating, and the rewards were a sense of accomplishment--a real physical milestone-- along with incredible 360 degree views.

The views were spectacular, but a rocky descent was vicious, and Jude wedged her foot between two boulders. She pushed through the pain for three miles before finally reaching shelter. We were happy to be there before the skies opened and happy to see that Sky was there. We first met Sky on day one, when we crossed paths--she rescued a baby squirrel who had fallen from a tree.

The river at the NOC disappeared from sight after only a few steps into the dense forest, and the usual views of trees and rocks was interrupted by a memorial for a firefighter who gave his life while trying to suppress a wildfire.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562406,"Woohoo!! Conquered ""Jacob's Ladder"" on this leg of the trail. Frequent breath breaks due to the steepness of the straight up climb was the biggest challenge. I really expected a rocky terrain, so the relatively clear, step-like climb was a bonus. 
The shelter, on the other hand, was anything but a bonus. In addition to being mouse-infested, there was an approximate 3-foot wide open space between the front part of the structure and the sleeping section, that ran the width of the shelter. Since the shelter is raised a few feet off the ground, this meant that anyone going into, or coming out of, the sleeping section had to step over this open space, which we dubbed the moat. There were wood planks to bridge the moat, but they were not anchored, so they skid out of place. I heard two crashes in the middle of the night--yep, two someones fell into the moat. I later learned this was designed this way, but the source (a ridge runner) couldn't explain why. I was glad to move on.","

it was an on-again, off-again rainy day, and the clouds seemed to follow me. Got to Cable Gap Shelter just before a T-storm hit. It was too early to stop for the day, so I had lunch and made the decision to move on, if the rain did not stop by 2 pm. It stopped at 2:05. The next opportunity to break trail to resupply was 5.5 MI away, but I had to be there by 6 pm to make the last shuttle. My pace is slower than that, but I opted to go for it. I got there at 5:30!!

All regular rooms were booked, so they allowed me to stay in an admin wing of a building on the perimeter of the property at a reduced rate. I gladly accepted, but in retrospect realized it was not the smartest choice--no phones, no cell service, and no one else but me in the enture section. I really didnt have much choice, so I stayed the night

Solar charger for phones too--and real men's and women's restroom with showrs--what a luxury. 
I claimed my spot in the shelter after hearing the weather forecast for more T-storms, then rushed up to the parking area for the much heard about trail magic. The Trail magic was beyond imagination! I was first greeted by ladies from a church group who gave me a zip lock baggie filled with wonderful trail treats then turned around to see another group who was sponsoring a veritable banquet -- everything from bacon, eggs, burgers hot dogs, desserts, fruit, ice cream, sodas and beer to first aid-type needs. Before I could take it all in (literally and figuratively ), I heard a familiar voice calling my name--it was Sky!!!! I spent much of the rest of the sunny afternoon enjoying nothing but good food and good company. 
As evening appriached, so did the storm clouds. Cracks of Thunder were deafening -- one sounded like a sonic boom and anyone who had already been snug in their sleeping bags bolted upright, while those who were still awake and watching the storm from the covered area outside the shelter rushed inside faster than a lightening strike. The storm hovered and continued all night. It was a restless night for me, due in part to the storm, but also due to the anxiety of entering the Great Smoky Mountain National Park in the morning.","

It was raining, but the sky showed promise of a break in the weather, so I started up the hill toward the dam and toward the Smokies. I had tight hold of my permit, which needed to be deposited into a box just before entering the Park. I stopped at the visitor center -- it was closed. I had heard there are some really interesting artifacts and information about the dam there, so I was disappointed with the timing. I moved on. I crossed the dam and made my way to the Smokies. The rain followed me every step of the way, and by now was a driving downpour. Finally, I entered the park and stuffed the now soggy permit into a box that was already overflowing with the permits of those thru hikers who preceded me. I was now officially hiking on the AT in the Smokies. I didn't want the rain to dampen my spirit, but with each foot of elwvation, it got colder and colder, until the torrential downpour became sleet and the high winds drove the sleet horizontally stinging any exposed skin. The trail turned into a river; the babbling brooks turned into rushing waterfalls. I was miserable, yet there was no way out of this--I just had to keep going. Even if it had been allowed, I would not have stopped short of the shelter to pitch my tent--I want the protection of the shelter, and the warmth of other people. As I rounded every false summit with no shelter in sight, I became more and more discouraged, thinking I should have stayed at the Fontana Hilton, but I had no way of knowing this was what awaited me. After slopping through ankle- deep water and falling in the mud a couple of times, I had a momentary meltdown, when God sent his angel in the form of another thru hiker who offered to stay with me to make sure I was ok. Moments later...the shelter. I was tired, hungry, and drenched to the bone, but I knew the first thing I needed to do was to get into dry clothes, but there was a problem. Absolutely everything in my backpack except my sleeping bag was waterlogged. I managed to strip down inside my sleeping bag. The wet clothes lay in a heap at the foot of my sleeping space, which was cramped, as the shelter designed for 12 now housed at least 14 hikers--all cold, wet, and weary, but safe from the elements.

My clothes were still wet--to the point where I could still wring puddles from them, but I needed to move on. Sky and I set out with a goal of going 12 miles to Derrick Knob Shelter, but when we stopped mid-way at the Spence Field Shelter for lunch, the sun came out and the gentle warm breeze invited us to stay.

The sun felt good after the previous cold, rainy days, but the warmth gave way to cold blustering winds by the time we got to shelter. Another storm was on its way. 
No surprise, we woke up to another deluge. The force of the winds blew the tarp that covered the open end of the shelter out of the rocks that anchored it. A few of us decided to wait to see if the storm would pass before venturing out, to avoid a repeat of our previous encounter with the vicious winds and rain. By mid-day, it was clear we were not moving out, as the storm seemed to gain strength as the day went on, and the dwindling daylight would not outlast our pace, leaving us mud hiking by moonlight. 
Our decision to zero was soon under fire when the ridge runner came in and ordered everyone who had stayed in the shelter the previous night to leave, citing a ""one night per shelter"" rule--a rule I wasn't aware of. Near mutiny followed as several hikers were quick to defend the decision to stay put. After some convincing, the ridge runner conceded and allowed a few of us to stay, recognizing our ability to reach the next shelter in daylight would be impeded by our slower pace. The younger, faster hikers heeded the order to leave and braved the cold downpour once again. 
The ridge runner was just doing his job. He had a dilemma with so many people taking cover, yet knowing another wave of hikers would soon arrive, needing a place to stay. No hard feelings to the ridge runner--he was actually quite nice.","

But that was the worst of this 7 MI hike. The trek was easy, and the ground was popping with splashes of color everywhere. Entering the conifer zone was surreal--I was surrounded by giant spruces, and the fragrance was intoxicating. The shelter came into view sooner than expected, but I welcomed the rest and the beautiful setting and called it a day. Interestingly, the shelter was situated between two water sources (hence the name)--one spring was in NC, the other in TN.

Unfortunately, dense fog and overcast skies obliterated the 360 degree views, so I opted not to climb the tower. My food supply was running liw, so I chose to take advantage of a free shuttle into Gatlinburg to resupply. While waiting for the shuttle. A fellow thru hiker offered to take me into town, so I didn't even have to wait. Thanks Moonpie!
Gatlinburg is NOT my kind of town--no offense to the residents there (or to Dolly Parton). No shortage of things to do, and you can buy just about anything--except groceries. The town's grocery store was outside the main strip, accessible by trolley, but the trolley only ran every 30 minutes. By the time I checked into my hotel (a whole adventure in itself ), did laundry, and purchased some new rain protective gear, I was too tired to wait for the trolley, so I resupplied at Walgreens. Not ideal and super expensive, but less hassle. The price of convenience. I settled into my overpriced room and slept better than I exoected.","

I reached the shelter at about 2:30 to find a group of hikers already there trying to dry out. I was glad to discover that my new rain protection efforts were successful, as the items in my backpack were dry, even if I was drenched to the bone. Soon after setting up my sleeping space and changing into dry clothes, the rain slowed and the sun came out!! Everyone rushed to get their wet clothes outside to dry, using very creative ways to ""hang"" them--trekking poles, privy sign post, and sticks stuck into the side of the shelter which served as pegs. Because if the high winds, there was always someone chasing down a shirt, sock, or pair of pants that broke loose from its drying post. It was actually a pretty comical scene.","

I was feeling good and had pep in my step, and I felt like I finally could maintain a constant, quick pace.

Then I came to the sign--I had gone 1.3 miles down the wrong trail. I cried, did an about face, and started retracing my steps to get back on track.

It quickly became clear that the weather reports were spot on. Winds were so strong, I was walking sideways at some points. There was no reprieve at lower elevations either.

The driver was very knowledgeable about the AT, especially though the Smokies. When he realized where I would be resuming my hike, he strongly advised that I avoid staying at the Davenport Gap Shelter, describing it as a zoo, where humans are enclosed in a cage and bears come to visit. He said it was the only shelter in the Smokies that had not been improved. With this in mind, I intended to go to the next shelter, but given my late start and still painful foot, I was doubtful I would make it in daylight. Still, I planned to go for it. 
I was glad to finally be out of the Smokies, but not so glad to see the black clouds hovering overhead. Ughhhh, here we go again.. it started slowly--a gentle rain that made me feel this would pass quickly. Instead, it increased in intensity. When the Temps plummeted, I knew I would not make it to the next shelter. I called the Standing Bear Hostel, and soon found myself in a shed with other hikers who also escaped the weather. The shed could not have been more than 6 ft by 10 ft. It had a table at one end and a rough-built counter with sink at the other. A microwave, toaster oven, pizza oven, and dorm-sized fridge were crammed in the space also. This was the hostel's ""kitchen."" I waited here and chatted with the other hikers, some of whom I had already crossed paths with previously, when outside the hail pounded the thin she'd walls and bounced off the rocky path. ""Cowboy"" was recounting his night at the Davenport Gap shelter. Then he showed us the picture of the bear that came within 10 feet of him--just as he was locking himself in the cage that surrounded the shelter. Glad I took the shuttle driver's advice.

The day held the promise if sunshine, and I planned to take full advantage, so a big breakfast was in order. After breakfast, I packed, said my ""see ya laters"", then hit the trail. A short way down the road--just before the AT trailhead--trail magic!! I was so full from my big breakfast, but I couldn't pass up the bananas. Fresh fruit is always welcome.
The trail started with a straight up climb, but at least the terrain was good. Unfortunately, it didn't take long before I hit the first of many major road blocks--downed trees from the recent high winds--completely burying the trail beneath. I had to weave through the branches, in some cases taking my backpack off to shove it under, while I hurdled over the giant trunks. This would turn out to be a frequent exercise for many more miles ahead. It is scary to think someone could have been hiking the trail when the trees came crashing down. To my knowledge, there were no incidents reported.
The uphill climb seemed to never end. I was convinced I had missed the aviation tower that the trail angels described as a white spaceship, when suddenly the landscape changed from a dense forest to a bald. There in the middle of the bald was the white spaceship. Odd and out of place, the tower apparently emits beacons for air traffic control in the area.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571058,"This was a day marked by delays.  I was the first in the camp to wake up, as I was anxious to set out with an ambitious goal of hiking past the next shelter to the following one 15.5 mi away.  I packed my sleeping gear in record time then headed to the bear cables to retrieve my bear bag only to encounter my first delay of the day (no, not a bear).  Another hiker had jury-rigged a cable to the one I was using, causing the tension to be so tight, I could not release it.  I don’t fault the hiker—there were fewer cables here than in other locations, and each was already overloaded with bear bags.  One cable was rendered useless because it was too short to be anchored to the tree (to lift the bag out of bear’s reach, one end of the cable hooks to a nearby tree).  One resourceful hiker found a way to jury-rig the short cable to the cable I (and others) was using.  I had to wait 30 minutes for someone to wake up and help me retrieve my bag—it took three of us to release the tension.  I dubbed this delay, the “bear bag debacle delay.”
The second delay came about two miles into the hike—another stretch of rock-climbing.  This section would have been more tolerable had my backpack cooperated.  It kept slipping off my hips, pulling back on my shoulders.  I had to stop three times to try to make the adjustment.  Meanwhile, all the hikers who left camp after me were skipping up and down the boulders like mountain goats.  Like yesterday, a bypass was offered, which would have been an easier trek, but I wanted to stay true to the trail.  So much for my “early” start.
Hiking was fairly easy after the boulders, and I reached the next shelter early enough that I felt confident I could continue on and make my goal of reaching Hogback Ridge Shelter, but I still had nearly 9 miles to go.  I ate lunch quickly and resumed hiking.  About 2.5 miles into the hike I saw a bear bag hanging over the trail with a note inviting hikers to help themselves to whatever was inside.  It was a clear bag, and it looked like a lot of good things, but I resisted—not because I wasn’t hungry, but because I didn’t want to take time to un-do the intricately wrapped and knotted cord that held the bag in place.  This would have to be a gift for a more patient (and speedy) hiker.  Soon afterwards, I reached a road, where it seemed the trail abruptly ended.  No signs indicating where to pick it up on the other side of the road.  I paced back and forth, crossed the street and back, retraced steps on the trail to see if I missed a sign.  Nothing.  Suddenly, I heard the faint calling of a fellow hiker—it was Bean, yelling to me from an obscure path across the road, beckoning me in her direction—she had found where the trail continued.  I was so grateful that she recognized I needed to be re-directed.  If it had not been for Bean, who knows how long I would have been pacing back and forth looking for this ill-marked path.  It was a short one, but a delay nonetheless.
The next delay was self-inflicted.  I voluntarily went off trail, following the signs to the hostel that advertised “fresh fruit,” a temptation I could not resist.  Unfortunately, the fruit was all gone by the time I got to the hostel.  Since I was already there, I stayed for some pizza and to chat with other hikers.  
It was nearly 4 pm, and I still had almost 6 miles to go—I knew I’d have to pick up my pace, and I knew I could not afford any more delays—self-inflicted or otherwise!  Unfortunately, the delays were not done yet. 
About two miles after returning to the trail from the hostel, I missed a switchback and continued straight.  It wasn’t until I started seeing the trash on the path—rusted out auto parts and an old metal wash basin—that I realized I strayed.  I did an about face to retrace my steps and get back on track, but I was no longer able to see the path I followed.  I soon found myself wading in knee-deep weeds and listening for the waterfall that would point me in the right direction.  And praying.  The approx. 15 minutes I was wandering seemed like hours, and when I finally found the trail, I was overwhelmed with a thankful heart, knowing that it was the Lord who led me there.  I later learned that I was not the only hiker who missed the switchback.   
With about four miles yet ahead, I considered the possibility of stopping at a campsite short of the shelter.  However, when I arrived at the campsite, no one else was there, and I didn’t want to stay there alone, so I pressed on.  Daylight was quickly fading, and I found myself singing “Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path” (from Ps 119:105).  Finally, at 8:30 pm, I dragged my weary but thankful self into the shelter site--with 30 minutes of daylight to spare. I scarfed down a quick dinner, hung my bear bag, and was snug in my sleeping bag by 9:30. 
The delays were frustrating—not in my plan—but I am grateful to have made it to camp in one piece.  If ever I doubted that God is always by my side, I need only to remember this day.

The pneumonia cleared in about four weeks, after a round of antibiotics and rest.   The stress fracture was slower to heal, but is now boot-ready again.  My plan to is try to return to the trail by 1 Aug and squeeze in as many more miles as I can before taking a break and resuming next Spring—hopefully, with my trail sister, Hey Jude.
Back to May 15. 
Other than another tortuous climb toward the end, the 10.1 mile hike to the Bald Mountain Shelter was relatively uneventful, save for the people I met on the way.   Nose Flute was probably the most interesting of the passers by.  You could hear him playing his nose flute (yes, there is apparently such an “instrument”) from yards away.  When he was about 20 feet in front of me, he started a tune that he later explained was welcoming the queen (presumably the queen was me).  We stopped for friendly greetings and chit chat, and he played a medley of tunes for me before parting ways.  He put a smile on my face—quite an accomplishment at this point of my hike.
Then there was the gentleman with two German shepherd dogs.  One of the dogs pretty much rolled on her back right in front of me, expecting a belly rub.  After talking with the hiker, I learned that he participates in a program to raise dogs that will be eventually surrendered to a training school for seeing eye dogs.  The pooch that wanted the belly rub “failed” the class because of her overly playful nature.  As the person who raised her, the hiker had first dibs to re-claim her after she dropped out of the school.  I don’t recall his name or his dogs’ names, but it was an interesting encounter, and I am thankful for his work to help others.
Many others passed by—young, old, barefoot, and even some with obvious challenges that some may consider a disability, i.e. prosthetic leg.  I stopped to chat with many, welcoming the break, however short, while exchanging a simple “happy trails” with others.  Interesting how different we all are, yet how alike—on the trail and off.
I crossed the bald and reached the shelter early enough to plan my next few miles into Erwin, TN.  While my shelter mates were discussing transportation options to Damascus, VA to attend Trail Days, which would take place the weekend of 19 May, I was contemplating transportation options to the med clinic.  My foot was screaming at me, and my cough was a constant companion—maybe it was time to figure out what was going on.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Just after setting up my tent, it started to rain.  The rain, plus late-comers to the campsite, made for a restless night, but I was anxious to get up and get started, since the next stop would be the hostel in Erwin, TN.  After looking at the guide book, it seemed as though most of the 5.5 miles ahead were downhill and fairly easy terrain, so I decided to not backtrack the .6 miles to get water, even though there were no other water sources between this shelter and Erwin.  I just wanted to move forward, not backward.   I had only 20 oz.  I was glad to not carry the added weight of water, but I knew I was taking my chances.  I sipped my last drop about 20 minutes before the descent into town.  It was a hot, sunny day and little shade at the summit.  I was parched and really wanted to dive off the cliff into the beautiful inviting Nolichucky river.  I resisted, though, and made it safely to Uncle Johnny's hostel, where I promptly downed a large bottle of orange juice.
I decided to treat myself to a cabin for the night.  After settling in a bit, I walked the grounds of the hostel and chatted with many of my fellow hikers.  Trail Days and/or injuries were the primary topics of discussion.   A big group of us piled into the hostel's van to a ride into town for dinner.  We split up according to where we wanted to eat.  I joined Meghan for an Italian dinner.  I met Meghan on the road to Hot Springs, and we've been leap frogging since.  She is also suffering from some unknown foot injury.  We commiserated over a lovely dinner--a HUGE serving of lasagna, which I easily managed to scarf down-- before returning with the rest of the crowd to the hostel.  A great way to close the day.

These past two-plus months have been difficult.  I kept thinking I would be ready to return much sooner, but age has a way of interfering with the healing process.  The time off trail allowed me to visit with my children, take a road trip to MI with Hey Jude, pay a quick visit to my work colleagues, and attend my dear friend's retirement ceremony.   I am also glad to say that, despite being off trail, I have kept in touch with some of my hiker friends—Meghan, Brighty and Wreck, and Trooper.  AND, while doing a practice hike in Harper’s Ferry, I met up with Cheese and Turbo Turtle!!!!  I was so glad to see them and chat with them.
I feel I am ready to return to the trail now, and my son will take me back to Erwin tomorrow.  I don’t know how far I can get in two months, but I am going to do my best—without over-exerting.  Two months is arbitrary—an artificial time line based on an original plan that I would be much farther north by this time, and weather would not allow me to continue beyond the end of September.  I may extend that time frame now, and I may fall short. My trail sister, Hey Jude, cannot re-join me at this time, but I am hoping we will be able to re-unite soon.  If not, we both know we will be back to finish what we started next Spring.

I was grateful that the next shelter was so close.  I needed to be careful not to overdo it and risk re-injuring my foot.  The smooth stretch of trail cushioned my feet, but the rocky section made me question the wisdom of returning this season.  Worse yet, it was lonely.  I passed one other hiker--a southbounder--and that was it.  No conversation, no motivator,  no moral support.  I thought of Hey Jude, my trail sister, the entire time.  
I reached the shelter early and settled in.  The water source was nothing more than a mud puddle, so I chose to eat a meal that did not require water.  I never considered bringing something to read, so I studied my trail guide book and planned my next few days.  And,  I waited for someone else to come.  No one ever did.  
Funny how one's imagination can take off when spending the night alone in the wilderness.   Every sound is amplified -- some sounds were real, like the owls and mice and  the barking/howling of coyotes.  I even thought I heard the sound of a cat meowing --were there bobcats here?  Then I realized the ""meowing"" was coming from  my stomach.  I think I may have slept 2-3 hours.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574226,"I was not in a huge hurry to leave early, as my plan was to hike 8 miles to a campsite,  and I didn't want to get there too early. If I had known those eight miles would stretch into more like 12 miles,  I might have considered leaving earlier. 
The trail was pretty easy except for a pretty rugged uphill climb,  the weather was gorgeous, and I was following the landmarks noted in the trail guide.  So, when I passed through the bald and reached the gravel road,  I knew I was close to the campsite.   But,  I couldn't find it.   I walked up and down the gravel road twice, and I didn't see any sign of the campsite or the white blazes that told me I was still on the AT, so I finally flagged down a motorist for direction.  I accepted his offer to take me to the location where he thought I needed to be,  but when we got there,  I realized it was four miles back to a point that I had already hiked.  Not keen on the idea of retracing the worst part of the hike, I asked the man if he could take me back to where we started.   He agreed,  and as we headed back,  he lit up a joint!   I told him I thought I saw the blaze (even though I hadn't), and asked him to drop me off, and he did.  Somehow, by the grace of God, I found the trail again.   I passed a hiker  (the only one that day) and asked him how to get back to where I needed to be.  He also confessed he had been confused at the same point.  It seems I missed a turn in the field when I first crossed the bald.  I backtracked, then continued hiking for a few miles before finding a campsite.   It was not the campsite I intended,  but it was a campsite.   I was exhausted, and it was getting dark, and I just wanted to get in my tent.   Another night alone, but I was too tired to care.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574255,"The night breeze was cool, and it made for a good sleep.  I was up before sunrise and packed and ready to go by 7.  I did not want a repeat of yesterday, and the trail ahead looked to be mostly uphill.  I'm so grateful my feet are holding up to the stresses of the trail,  but today's hike might really put them to the test.  
I knew I was in Unaka mountain as soon as I could smell the fragrance of the dense spruce forest.   The aroma made the challenging uphill climb a ltitle easier, and before i knew it, I reached the Cherry Gap shelter-- sooner than expected.   I stopped there only for a quick break and decided to keep moving.   The forest faded into a bald, and the trail took another downhill turn.  It was hot without the cover of trees, so I was glad for going downhill, and glad to see shade ahead.  The shade outlasted the descent.   When I reached Iron Mountain Gap, I crossed the road, and started another uphill climb, hoping to find water and a campsite soon.  About a mile into the hike, I saw the sign pointing to water, which I followed.  It took me through what looked like a cornfield with a row carved out for foot traffic.  My trekking poles kept getting tangled in the long stalks that covered the narrow path.  I finally reached the water source and, although it was a ""piped"" spring, barely a trickle dripped from the pipe.   Knowing I was close to the campsite,  I decided to fill up my water bottle,  camelback,  and two 64 oz sawyer water bags.  This will ensure I have enough water for dinner and breakfast without having to return to the spring.  Not a particularly good idea, since I really couldn't juggle the bags of water and my trekking poles.  One of the bags of water slipped from my hands,  and the impact caused the bag to split, which sent water shooting up in all directions.  
I never saw the campsite that was supposedly right by the cornfield water source,  but I was sure I would not have wanted to stay there anyway.   I trudged up for aproximately another mile when I saw a ""stealth"" campsite that looked too inviting to pass up--it was near the traIL and had a dry, level spot for the tent.  Just what I needed.  
I set up camp, ate dinner, hung my bear bag, and crawled into my sleeping bag.  The sounds of the strong breezes through the trees lulled me to sleep.   It didn't even occur to me that I was spending yet another night alone. ","Beauty spot gap campsite

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574261,"Short day planned, so no rush to tear down camp.  I contemplated checking out the hostel in just a few miles,  but realized I really didn't need anything--except maybe some company.   
The ""rock pillar"" was a bit of a let down.   I expected to see something like Stonehenge,  but it was just a huge boulder--still one landmark closer to my destination.   When I reached Greasy Creek Gap, I rested for my second breakfast.  According to the trail guide book, the hostel is on a trail .6 miles east of the AT.  Problem is, I saw two trails going East, and neither had a sign for the hostel.  It wasn't worth risking taking the wrong trail, so I elected not to go.  I just kept moving on and reached Clyde Smith shelter early.  I wanted to stop here, because I wanted to stay at the Roan High Knob shelter, which was too far to go today.  
I tried to find the water source.  A sign on the side of the shelter said to follow the blue blazes, and a sign posted on a tree seemed to agree, yet when I followed the blue blazes, the trail dead-ended at the AT.  I took this path twice, just to make sure I didn't miss a side trail.  I didnt.  Finally,  I tried a different trail, which led me right to a good flowing water source.  At least the search kept me occupied for awhile.
I was prepared to spend another night alone when two tenters came in--then another,  then a young man who sheltered, then another tenter.  YAY!! It was so nice chatting with Matt and Stephen, both in ministry with the Christian churches.   I'm so glad I stayed here.

I have not had a phone signal for several days, so I had no way of letting my daughter Monica know that I would soon be getting to Hughes Gap and Roan Mountain.  The first time I was on the trail, Monica and I talked about meeting up at Hughes Gap for a day hike together.  I was sad thinking that I missed the chance to see and spend time with her.  I can only hope there will be another opportunity to connect on the trail.
There  was a short uphill climb before starting the descent, which was a rare rock-free, root-free, smooth trail.  I was cruising along when i moved to the side to allow a young lady to pass.  We greeted each other, then 30 minutes later went our separate ways.   Yes, we stood in the middle of the trail and talked for almist 30 minutes!  Foxtrot thru-hiked the AT last year; she was very passionate about the trail and all too eager to share her words of wisdom--advice about gear, best sections of the trail, hostels--you name it.  I lived her enthusiasm.  She was doing a day hike and plans to hike the PCT next spring.  It was so nice to meet her.
I stopped at Hughes Gap and ate lunch by the granite stone memorial for the Hughes family.  I had to brush the broken glass aside before sitting, and I could not believe the amount of trash that littered the small parking area.  This is so disrespectful of nature and of the Hughes family.  I was already carrying about 2 pounds of my own trash, and I really didn't want to add another two pounds to the load,  so I left it behind, feeling guilty with every step up the next mountain. 
The various gaps and changes in terrain and elevation made for an interesting hike--they give some psychological assurance of progress.  But, I really knew I was approaching the shelter when I came to the fireplace in the middle of the trail.  I'll have to research this further--not something you see on the trail every day. 
Not long after the fireplace,  I reached the trail that would lead me to the Roan High Knob shelter,  the highest shelter on the AT at an elevation of 6193 feet.
At the end of the root-filled side trail sat the log-cabin shelter.  It had 4 walls, making it very dark inside.   It was too spooky for me, so I set up my tent.  
While eating dinner, Emily and Ryan dropped in to check out the site.  The brother and sister duo decided to stay; we chatted, hung our bear bags, then retreated for the night.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574272,"I was looking forward to today's hike.  I had heard nothing but good things about what the next section of trail has in store.
The start was a bit rough--hiking on the rocks of a creekbed--ankles rolling in every direction --then, the fall.  My trekking pole got stuck between rocks, and I kept slipping and sliding to the ground.   Not how I wanted to start the day.  After almost a mile of this slippery, rocky path, the trail turned west, and it was like being in a completely different place.  The trail was smooth  and wound through a beautiful park-like setting with several footbridges crossing the fast flowing creeks and springs.  After crossing the road at Carver's Gap, the scenery changed yet again. From the cover of forestry to the openness of several balds, which brought  a more spectacular view with each upward step.   
A lot of people were enjoying the beautiful weather on this sectiion of the trail, and i enjoyed talking with a lot of them, including a man who looked so much like my brother Eric, that i did a double-take, and a man who was walking his bicycle up the mountain in order to make a video. 
 I took a lot of breaks, not only to catch my breath, but to take in the views--there were plenty of good resting points.
Once out of the balds, I re-entered the cover of trees and wet, rocky road, but it wasn't long before I reached the Stan Murray shelter, where I stopped for a quick break.  Only two more miles to go.
The last two miles were smooth sailing,  and I reached Yellow Gap--and the side trail to the shelter--in an hour.
The shelter was hard to miss.   The huge red barn was a welcome sight.   This area has historical significance -- it was where the mountain men of the revolutionary war came.   I'll update this post after I research the facts.
The barn was converted to a shelter that could easily accommodate 20.  Four of us took up residence for the night. 
This was the first shelter since before Erwin that has a privy--it was even be-dazzled to add that royal throne touch.  I took pics especially for Madalyn , my co-worker's daughter, who was concerned about my not having some of these creature comforts.  I hope I can upload them.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574277,"Heading to a hostel to resupply, shower, and do laundry.  Can't wait.
However, the path was not hiker-friendly; two uphill and two downhills through balds, the second downhill looking better on paper (in the book) than in reality.  The miles of ups and downs were made much more difficult by the very narrow foot path--barely the width if your foot for most of the way--forcing you to either walk as if on a tightrope or walk with one foot on the path and the other on the elevated ground alongside the path.   In some spots, the grass was so tall, it flopped over the path, making it hard to see.  I was definitely glad to get back to ""normal"" ground--whatever that means on the AT.  At least the views were amazing, the breezes were constant, and each step brought me closer to my destination, and I officially crossed the border into TN. Until now, the trail criss-crossed between NC and TN.  Another milestone -- woo-hoo!
To this point, i was going at a fairly good clip, despite the path, but my pace was slowed by the treacherous, steep descents and poor trail markings that came early in the TN trail.  More than once I found myself at a fork in the road,  looking for a white blaze, only to find it tucked around the corner,  behind a big boulder.
My feet were starting to object to the terrain, and I was tempted to set up camp with the young couple who were at the barn last night,  but I decided to hike the extra half-mile to the main road that would lead me to the hostel.  Just as I reached the main road, the rains came.  I got my backpack cover on just before the monsoon hit.  I tried to hitch a ride to the hostel, but no one wanted a drenched hiker in their vehicle.  Fortunately, it was only a third of a mile to my destination; unfortunately,  they had no hostel spaces left--the man in the office seriously offered me a tent space.   Really?  The only other option was a room in their B&B,  at a cost more than five times that of the hostel.   I had no choice--I took it.
I was grateful for a hot shower and a dry place to lay my head.  Breakfast was phenomenal.   Since I got in too late to get everything done--i.e laundry and resupply -- I bit the bullet and took a zero day on Saturday.   I blew my full month's budget at one place, in one weekend.  I hope I don't end up regretting that.

These little landmarks break the monotony of long stretches of trail with nothing but rocks and trees.   Not that rocks and trees aren't beautiful, but a change of scenery is welcome.

However, this was probably the only time I was glad no one was at the shelter.   I stripped down out of my wet clothes and changed into dry ones as soon as I had taken care of my bear bag, then snuggled in my sleeping bag and listened as the rain pounded the shelter's metal roof all night long.  Yes, all night.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574727,"Again, I waited to see if the weather would break before moving on.  Two northbound hikers came past the shelter early, so I was somewhat encouraged that I would be sharing  the trail with other people.  Despite the rain, which had slowed to a hard drizzle, I headed out.  I hiked in the drizzle for ten minutes before the sky cleared, and the promise of a better weather day came with a glimpse of sunshine.  The forest is dark enough under the canopy, but add an overcast sky to the mix, and it feels as though you're night hiking.   I welcomed that glimpse of sunshine with a very grateful heart. 
The hike was going well,  I passed an older gentleman who was taking a rest break.   We exchanged greetings,  but I was not convinced that he was doing as OK as he said he was.   He really looked beat.   As I continued on,  I couldn't help but think of this man--I should have stayed with him longer to make sure he was indeed ""ok.""   The trail took me down a long, rocky descent--the same path the older gentleman had just climbed.   No wonder he looked beat. 
I hit the landmarks earlier than expected and,  with two miles left to go,  felt I could afford the luxury of chatting with some people who were picnicking in the parking area.   They told me the trail I was going to be hiking used to be where an old railroad line ran.   I asked them about the high water route that my guidebook cautioned me about.   The man indicated the high water route will take me to the shelter, but it was no longer part of the AT, it was a blie blaze trail.  He mentioned that other hikers followed the AT and didn't report any problems with high water, despite the recent heavy rains.   
I resumed hiking, and the next half mile was a beautiful, easy hike along the river.   When I reached the point where the high water bypass was,  I realized that there was really no way of knowing whether I should risk following the AT or play it safe and take the blue blaze.   Either way,  I would end up at the shelter.   I remained the purist and followed the white blazes.   The path consisted of rock steps that my trail sister would refer to as Paul Bunyan steps--in other words, steps that are better suited for people with super long legs.  It was grueling, but I reached bottom and was treated to a rushing waterfall--like a mini-Niagara.  I followed the trail along the river and came to a section where the trail was but a narrow ledge that hugged a big rock formation on one side and dropped off to the river on the other.   I'm not sure what I would gave done if I had met a hiker coming from the other direction.   Back on a ""normal"" trail again, I climbed upward for at least another half mile to the shelter, which I could easily have missed had I not seen the sign at a switchback behind me.
The last two miles of the hike took forever, and it was already starting to get dark.   By the time I finished getting water and eating dinner, it was pitch black, and I could no longer see the tree limb I had pre-selected for my bear bag. I stuffed everything into an odor barrier bag and tucked it under a fallen tree.   And prayed.  Between worrying about the bear bag  and the noises from the critters who we living under the shelter (bigger than mice), I got very little sleep.

My phone battery was down to 18%, and I was not able to charge my charger at the last B&B, so,  in a bit of a panic mode,  I opted to follow a blue blaze trail to a main road through town after only a mile on the AT.  I reached the main road and had enough juice to call the Boots Off Hostel, and the owner, Jim, picked me up.  I didn't realize that, had I stayed on the AT for another 6 miles, I would have landed pretty much at the hostel's doorstep.   Of course, had I taken more time to study my guidebook, I would have known. 
The following day (Aug 10), Jim took me back to where he picked me up.  I hiked the blue blaze trail for one mile to the AT junction, then I hiked the 6 miles I should have hiked yesterday.  I got a new phone charger, and I'll be back on track again tomorrow.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575316,"it was hard to leave the hostel, but I was glad to be back on the trail.  There was some trepidation, however,  about the path ahead.  The guidebook as well as postings on trees warned hikers that they were entering an active bear area.   In fact,  the Watauga shelter had been closed for a couple of years due to high bear population--bears that were not afraid of humans.   Picknicking, resting, pausing--anything but hiking--was strongly discouraged for a four mile stretch in this area.   I think I may have broken my own speed record.  
The trail to the closed shelter was uphill, but not too strenuous, then the bottom of the descent opened to the beautiful Watauga dam.  This area was still within the four mileSeasons where pausing was discouraged,  so I looked around cautiously before taking a couple of pictures and moving on.
All was going well until just about the halfway point to the shelter, when the rains came.  I'm guessing it rained for only 20 minutes,  but it came without warning, so I really didn't have time to don my rain gear.   I was almost dry by the time I reached the shelter. 
I did not see the stream that was supposedly about 2 miles before the shelter,  so when I arrived at the shelter,  I had no choice but to drop my gear and take the extra .4 mi  (one way) trek down a very steep hill to the water source.  Halfway down the hill, the second wave of the torrential downpour came.   When I finally reached the water source,  it was not much more than a trickle of water and a puddle.   I could squeeze more water oit of my drenched shirt quicker than from the ""spring"".

I chose not to wear my rain gear because, if it's not actually raining, the jacket and pants feel like a sauna.  I would regret that decision.  The overgrown brush on either side of the narrow trail was much like going through a car wash--I was soaked on all sides.  Then, a stiff breeze would shake the water from the trees as if it were raining.  Then, it actually did rain.  Ughh. 
As I hiked on, the rain shower stopped, and the warm breezes helped me dry out, though by now, my boots were so wet, my feet were squishing in them.  I reached the first shelter by 2 pm, certainly early enough that I could have continued on, but a tiny sliver of sunshine invited me to stay, with the hope of possibly drying out my clothes from yesterday's deluge as well as my boots.   
I hung my clothes all over the shelter, rearranging to capture the sun as it moved.   
As I was settling in and preparing dinner, Tracks, a section hiker I met at the Boots Off Hostel, stopped in for a break before moving on.  Then section hiker Jeff came in and set up his tent for the night.   We chatted a bit, and he helped me hang my bear bag--just in time to take cover from a vicious thunder storm that managed to spend the night over our campsite.  The winds were strong enough to bring large branches crashing down on the shelter roof.  I had to reposition myself to the back of the shelter to avoid getting wet.  I thought about Jeff in his tent.   At least I could see the tent was still where he pitched it. 
Even though I was able to rescue my clothes and boots before the t-storm hit, nothing dried,  and I ended up packing wet clothes and wearing wet socks and boots for yet another day.  I am glad, though, that I did not continue to the next shelter, or I'd be packing a wet tent, too.  I am still on track to reach Damascus by the 15th, but I was hoping to catch up with One Up, another section hiker I met at Boots Off Hostel.  Somehow, One Up stretched her lead to two days, even though she left the hostel only one day before I did.   She had been leaving me notes in the shelter registries, and it was fun to read them, but it would be even more fun to catch up with her again.  We'll see what the next couple of days have in store.","Vandeventner shelter

The trail was smooth and fairly level, and my pace was quicker than usual.  I reached the first landmark, a monument to honor Nick Grindstaff, a man who apparently made this part of the trail his home for 40 years.   It seemed fitting that the backdrop for this memorial was an eerily foggy forest.   
I was able to maintain a quick pace, as the trail was smooth and level.   Interesting, though, that every wet root I saw now looked to be a black snake.  This wetness has affected my brain.
Before I knew it, I had reached the road,  and what was the south end of the AT's handicap accessible section, a one mile section of gravel-like trail that crosses a beautiful farm pasture.  The sun was shining, with just a hint of storm-like weather in the form of dark clouds ahead.  The handicap accessible trail ended about halfway through the pasture.   It seemed an odd stopping point, but maybe there is a plan to extend this trail in the future.  The gravel-like trail became a muddy path,  but still level.  Just before leaving the pasture and entering the wooded area again, there were two places where a very large step was built to hurdle the fence meant to contain the cows.  I did not see cows.  A very strange passageway, for sure, and not optimal for the more ""mature "" hiker--or anyone with short legs.  Somehow I made it through.  
Still hiking at a good clip, my pace was slowed the last two miles by a steep climb.  I reached a point where a huge tree had fallen across the path.  The trail maintainers devised a creative ramp-step combo using stones and branches, to get over it.  Finally, about a mile after this obstacle, I reached the shelter.  It had not rained a drop!!  And, as an added bonus, the water source was close with decent flow.  Thank you. Lord!
I tried again to dry my clothes and boots by strategically placing them in the direct path of sunlight.   Unfortunately,  that sunlight gave way to the dark clouds, and, once again, the storms came.  I was thankful to be in a shelter and bedded down for the night, still dry.","Iron Mountain Shelter

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575329,"I was ready to leave a bit earlier than usual, with the thought that I would hike beyond the next shelter to the campsite just short of Damascus.   This would allow me to get into Damascus early enough that I could take care of everything I needed and be back on trail the next day.That plan was off to a bad start when, after about a mile of hiking, I realized I turned in the wrong direction when I left the shelter as i recognized the tree obstacle from yesterday.  Hard to explain how I did that, but basically, the trail did not actually pass the shelter--the trail came to the shelter--at the point of a ""V"".  Normally, if I turn right into the shelter when arriving, I turn right out of the shelter to continue.   That rule didn't apply here, since the trail never passed the shelter.  At any rate, I lost time, energy, and momentum. Nevertheless, the gentle ups and downs of the trail allowed me to reach the next shelter by 3:30.  I kept thinking it could have been 2:30, had I not made a wrong turn, which would have made my decision to go the extra 6 miles or so a lot easier.  I decided to  stay.  Not long after, another section hiker came, followed by another,  followed by a group of 4 guys.  The shelter was crowded, but it was a fun night of chatting and sharing stories and experiences. Then the rains came.  Really?  How many ways can I describe heavy rains?  Monsoons?  Deluge? Tropical storms?   Whatever you call it, it lasted all night--again.  And again, I was glad to be dry in the shelter and thankful I stopped there rather than going on to the campsite a few miles north.  The only tough part of an all night, non-stop downpour is waiting for the right moment to get iut to go to the bathroom. I was looking forward to getting to Damascus tomorrow. ","Double Springs Shelter

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575331,"Everyone was stirring early, and we were all pumped to reach our respective destinations.  The group of four guys and one tenter were heading south, one tenter and I were heading north.   I knew my only chance of really drying out was getting to a hostel, so the fact that there was still a light drizzle did not delay my start.
The drizzle stopped, but again the breezes brought showers from the trees.  I was prepared this time, with my rain gear and backpack cover.
I got three hours of relatively dry hiking in before --you guessed it--the heavy downpour came again.  This would have been harder for me to handle, if the trail had been difficult, but in fact, it was a smooth terrain and barely any change in elevation.
The highlight of my hike was reaching the TN-VA state border.   It was a ray of sunshine in my otherwise cloudy, waterlogged day.  The trail turned into a rushing river.   I was half expecting to see a duck swimming in it.  There was just no place to step without sinking into ankle deep water or mud.   Just how saturated can earth get?
The rains slowed and finally stopped just short of Damascus.  I knew I was getting close as I could hear the city traffic.  Then, despite the weather, I arrived--in record time--in Damascus.  I took a picture of the welcome sign just before the second wave of the storm hit.  I took cover in a shelter in the city park until it passed about 30 minutes later.   When there was a pause in the rain, I headed for the nearby visitor center to try to get a feel for the lay of the land.  The center was open, but not staffed.  I headed out and just started walking.  I wasn't five minutes into my walk before I bumped into One Up, who was on her way to the library.   I was so excited to see her!!  We chatted briefly,  and she pointed me in the direction of the hostel where she was staying, which was on the same block as the outfitter's, where I was going to pick up a package my trail sister sent me--the GPS locator  (Spot).  I stopped for lunch, picked up my package,  and checked in at Crazy Larry's hostel,  where I shared a room with One Up.  After laundry was done and I had a much needed shower,  One Up and I were ready to  go out for dinner.  Unfortunately,  practically the whole city closes down at 5 pm, including restaurants.  We ate at Subway and got an ice cream bar for dessert from the gas station.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577100,"Crazy Larry gave me a parting gift—a beaded necklace with “AT” etched in the flat bead at the center bottom.  I had originally no intention of staying at this hostel, mainly because I had heard it was a “party” hostel.  Had it not been for One Up being there, I could well have been at a different place on the other side of town.  I saw no sign of the “crazy” in Larry’s hostel.  He was a gracious host and did not hesitate to witness to his guests about his transformation after accepting the Lord as his Savior.  Quite a story.
I had breakfast at MoJo’s—a huge bagel smothered with cream cheese and a cheese omelet.  The carbs and protein gave me the push I needed to get back on the trail.  The sky was overcast, and two gentlemen who were planning a bike ride that day confirmed that the forecast called for rain.  At least I would start the day dry.  I left my Danner boots in the hiker box at the hostel—they were too waterlogged and mildewy to continue wearing.  In their place, a pair of Oboz that I got from the outfitter’s FOR FREE!!!!  These were new hikers that were returned by the purchaser due to fit issues, and the store could not re-sell.  I bought insoles, and left the store with new, dry hiking shoes.  Now, the test would be whether they would be trail-worthy.  I had no doubt they could not be worse than the beat up Danner’s, which served me well when they were dry.
An occasional breeze broke the dense, humid air, but the rain held off!!  I wondered whether I would cross anyone’s path, when out of nowhere, “Greeter” appears.  Greeter, so named because he stops to chat with all hikers, was completing the final 500 mi of his Southbound thru-hike.   We shared experiences for a few minutes (he posted his chat on you-tube, under Greeter’s 2017 AT thru hike, day 146—One Up is at the beginning of his video, and I am toward the end) before going our separate ways. 
The climb was challenging enough with its rocky terrain, but then I came to a detour sign.  A bridge was being re-built, so the official AT trail diverted around it.  I could only hope the detour did not add miles or difficulty to the hike.  At least the detour was well marked, and took me to a stopping point on the VA Creeper Trail, a 34-mile bike trail that followed the path of a former railway.  I took advantage of a bench to eat my lunch—spam slice in pita, a chunk of cheddar cheese, a handful of Combos pretzel snacks, and a cup of applesauce, all from a recent resupply outing in Damascus.  I eat well the first few meals after resupply, partly because it’s there, and partly to reduce the weight I have to carry.  I love the applesauce snacks, but they don’t travel well in a backpack—bulky with a thin top seal closure that is susceptible to puncture—so I try to eat those as soon as possible.   I hurried through the lunch break, because I was surrounded by bees who also wanted a share of the sweet treat.  I tossed the remnants of my lunch in a handy trash container, grateful that I would not have to carry it with me, and continued to follow the detour, which didn’t seem to take me too far out of the way before returning me to the rugged uphill climb.  As usual, the last two miles of this stretch seemed more like 20 miles, and Greeter’s report of a challenging rocky section and monster climb was spot on.  By the time I had summited, I felt like I had climbed Mt. Everest, but in fact the elevation had only been a few hundred feet.   At least I made it with daylight to spare.
The shelter was nice, and the surrounding area was flat.  Water was easy to get to, and a cord was already hanging down from the perfect bear-bag-hanging tree.  I was getting comfy and decided to leaf through the register.  One Up left me a message.  Not sure she knows how much I looked forward to seeing her notes; they were special gifts for me.  Other comments in the register focused on black snake presence at the shelter.  Hmm, if there are black snakes, then maybe no mice.  Which would I rather deal with?  I almost set up my tent, but the threatening sky made me reconsider, and I settled in for the night in the shelter.  No company--just me and the snakes that I was sure would find their way into my sleeping bag by morning.  They didn’t.","
",Saunders Shelter,"Aug 17, Thu",9.80
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577104,"I did not sleep well, and my mood reflected that.  Good thing I was alone.  I really was dragging my feet and slow to get moving but, grateful that my bear bag was intact, that I did not have any slithery visitors in my sleeping bag, and that it had not rained overnight, I resisted the temptation to linger. I headed out.  The loop confused me a bit, again—it seemed I had turned a different direction upon arriving last night.  I followed the white blazes, though, and came to the sign that assured me I was heading north.  VA was kind to post signs every now and then.  With few exceptions, the only directional “signs” on the trail to this point were the white blazes, and you just had to know whether you were heading north or south.  I like signs.
I wasn’t a mile into my hike when I couldn’t help but notice how wet my back was.  It hadn’t rained, and surely I couldn’t have worked up that much of a sweat in so short a time.  I stopped for a gear check only to find that my Camelback had sprung a leak.  I was tempted to return to the last shelter to spread things out and try to fix the leak, but a quick text to my daughter convinced me to just keep moving forward.  I dumped the remaining water from the camelback, tried as best as I could to dry the contents of my backpack (most items were not affected, because they were in plastic bags), reloaded, and kept moving forward.  I still had the Sawyer water bag and smart water bottle, and I was thankful to have these back up means to carry water, even though it meant I would have to make more frequent stops for refills.  
The trail led to another stretch on the VA Creeper Trail and across an impressive wooden bridge dedicated to Luther Hassinger, the founder of a lumber company that cleared the way for the VA Creeper Trail.  I thought I was home free after crossing the bridge, but the two miles that followed were grueling, and the dark skies looked like they would explode any minute.   Even though it had not rained yesterday or today, the ground was still wet, and roots and rocks were slippery, so I took extra caution to avoid a mishap, but my efforts were unsuccessful.  I managed to slip on a rock and felt the twinge in my knee.  It was not so bad I could not continue hiking, but bad enough that each step was painful.  When I reached the shelter, I decided I would not go any further, even though it was early enough for me to go on to the campsite only 1.4 miles down the trail.  This way, I rest my knee and can figure out how to fix my camelback.  Pretty much, those were just excuses.  For whatever reason, my heart was not into the hike today, but I was glad I put a few miles behind me. 
I emptied my backpack to try to dry it out from the leaky water bag, but the effort was futile, as the rains came soon after I set everything out on the picnic table to dry.  Déjà vu.  
Just as I was accepting that I would spend another night alone, a young couple arrived.  Lindsey and John, AKA “Gram” and “Gramps” were section hiking, with a goal of reaching Marion in just a few days.  They’re from the Akron, Ohio area!!!  We talked about work, Ohio, the hike, the preparation for the hike, the experience, our families.  You name it.  Their arrival and company changed my whole frame of mind, and I felt re-energized.  I didn’t know if our paths would cross again—they were fast hikers and covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time, but I believe God brought them to that shelter that night to give me the mental boost I needed to keep pushing forward.    
Morning came, Gram and Gramps retrieved their bear bag and realized an intruder visited—evidence of a mouse chewing its way through to the feast inside their bear bag.  Gram and Gramps did everything right—those tenacious rodents just don’t give up.  My bear bag was unscathed, possibly due to the layers of “odor resistant” bags or possibly because the smorgasbord within was not as enticing. 
My knee felt better, but I took some Ibuprofen anyway, in anticipation of the long hike ahead.  I left camp soon after Gram and Gramps, carrying my still wet backpack.  At least my spirit was no longer dampened—I left with a better outlook, and even excitement, to be closer to the Grayson Highlands.  First, I needed to conquer Mt. Rogers.","Saunders Shelter
",Lost Mountain Shelter,"Aug 18, Fri",6.50
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577106,"It’s easier to think of a 12+ mile hike in terms of three 4-mile sections, and it is helpful when there is variation in scenery and terrain.  This stretch brought a little bit of everything.  Including landmarks to help me gauge my progress. 
The first of the two climbs looked worse on paper than in reality.  It seemed I was hiking at a faster pace than usual, which was good, since I left camp late—again.  I summited White Top Mountain, about 5 miles into the hike, before taking my first break.  I munch on snacks while hiking, but actually sitting down, taking off the backpack, and stretching my back are activities I reserve for the perfect location—like a flat rock in the shade by a water source.  I found just a spot and took advantage of it, but couldn’t enjoy it for long, as it was already after 1, and I still had about 7 miles to go. 
I don’t recall whether it was before or after my lunch break, but the hike took me over some open fields with pretty incredible views.  I saw a landscape photographer taking advantage of the sunny day.   We talked about the views and the trail, and he took my picture before heading off in a different direction.  The scenery changed soon after, as the trail took me back to the cover of the forest, where the sun only peeked through the trees every now and then, casting shadows that played tricks on the eyes.  To some, the shadows were probably just a lighting effect, but to me, they were an adversary.  I had obviously dealt with shadows on the trail before, especially when the day wears on and the sun shifts, but for whatever reason, today’s shadows were more bothersome.  I danced around what I thought might be obstacles, I tight-roped where I thought the trail might drop off on the side.  But, unfortunately, the shadows camouflaged wet roots and I managed to slip on one that jarred and re-injured my knee when it came to an abrupt stop at the bottom of the small descent.  I was almost 8 miles into the hike at this point.  I stopped to lean against a huge boulder and took some Ibuprofen, when three ladies who were geocaching passed and checked on my welfare.  I assured them that I would be ok, and I returned to hiking.  It was only a couple hundred yards to the parking area, and I thought if I still had problems at that point, I could hitch a ride into town from there.  It was Saturday, and there were a lot of people out enjoying the weather.  By the time I reached the parking area, I felt confident I could continue.  I only had 4 more miles, but I was running out of day.  It was already 3:30.
The next two miles were typical trail miles—ups, downs, rocks, obstacles and, finally, I reached the sign that indicated the shelter was 2 miles ahead.  I was on track to reach the shelter by 7 pm, which hopefully will still give me enough daylight to go through the evening routine of settling in for the night.  However, the trail became increasingly more difficult—rocks, steep climbs, switchbacks—not one section that could be considered “easy.”   Adding to the difficulty was the pure volume of people.  Yielding to faster hikers meant stepping aside, sometimes on precarious rocks.  When I reached a clearing, which I took to be the Briar Ridge, I knew I still had a mile to go before reaching shelter, but by now I realized there would not be room in the shelter for me, so I was keeping my fingers crossed for a decent campsite and enough daylight to set up my tent.  There were neat little cut outs for tent sites on the sides of the trail, and I was ecstatic to see that Gram and Gramps were setting up camp in one of them!!  Gramps confirmed my thoughts that the shelter was full, but by the looks of it, I wasn’t so sure I’d find a tent site either.  I pressed on and came upon a small area that would work for my small tent.  The sun was setting, so I hurried to set up camp.  I had to re-position the tent several times before settling on one that seemed most level.  I hung my bear bag—it was hanging so low, though, it was laughable—pretty much eye height for the average person.  Oh well, it was off the ground.  My knee was feeling the rigors of the last few miles, so I took more Ibuprofen before calling it a night, feeling good that I tackled VA’s highest peak.","
",Thomas Knob Shelter,"Aug 19, Sat",12.30
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577108,"I did not roll out of my tent, no one knocked themselves out from my bear bag, and my knee felt better.  A great start to the day. 
I packed everything but the tent before eating breakfast.  The tent was wet from so much dew/condensation, that I wanted to give it as much time as possible to dry out before packing it.  No sense in carrying the extra water weight 
I had a hearty breakfast, in preparation for what I had hoped would be a long hike—through the Grayson Highlands State Park, past the next shelter, and onto the following shelter, 11.9 miles away.  I knew this was possible, given my accomplishment yesterday—12.3 miles.   It didn’t take long for me to scarf down a double dose of oatmeal in addition to Carnation Instant breakfast, a donut (more like donut crumbs, since donuts are hard to protect from smashing in the backpack), and the all-important cup of coffee.  
I was packed and on the trail by 8:30.
A lot of people were out enjoying the sunny day, many continuing their weekend journey, others just getting started.  It was great to see so many families and groups, individuals and couples taking advantage of the weather, the weekend, and the parks.  
Though fairly level, the rocks and boulders made for another treacherous hike.  At one point, the trail went through a short, narrow cave-like tunnel.  My backpack barely cleared the rock sides, and there would be no room to step aside if someone else had come from the other direction.    My knee was holding up, but every now and then reminded me that I needed to be cautious, not that I wasn’t cautious traversing the boulders.  Each step had to be pre-planned, calculated—should I go up, down, around? 
There was a short reprieve from the rocks where bushes lined the trail.  I heard the sound of movement on my side that really scared me—it was very close, and whatever it was was larger than a bird or rodent.   Then, as I rounded the curve, the source of the sound became apparent—it was ponies!!!  I had not yet officially reached the Grayson Highlands, but the prize of today’s hike was right in front of me.  They were oblivious to my presence as they happily chomped on the grass and whatever other goodies they found in the rare patch of green. 
Not far beyond that point, the ground leveled out, and I could see the entrance sign to the Grayson Highlands State Park (GHSP), and beyond that—more ponies.  These ponies were right on the trail, with their heads under the shade of the trees.  One pony was lying down.  I didn’t think it looked well, but there was no official near by to ask about it.  It was on its side with flies going in and out of its mouth.  It was breathing, but something just didn’t look right about it.  I mentioned it to other park visitors, but they just thought the pony was resting in the shade.  I had to accept that, and move on.  I figured park officials probably would notice, given how close to the trail the ponies were. 
At some point before the next parking area, I realized I had reached the 500 mile mark of my journey.  Maybe I can do this, after all! 
The open field was soon behind me, and once again I found myself in the wooded area, still a part of the GHSP.  I could hear ponies neighing, but I could not see them.   I continued to weave through stiles and fences and, before long, I came upon the Wise Shelter.   I had no plan to stay here, but I took advantage of the opportunity to take a break.  I read the register and the note that One Up left for me—she was a day ahead, and only stopped at the Wise Shelter for a break before going on to Old Orchard Shelter, 6.7 miles away.  That was my plan as well. 
I had enough water to get me to the next source, so I didn’t refill.  I just hit the trail.  Of course, about .2 miles after leaving, I “hit the trail” literally.  I crossed the footbridge and made it through the next stretch of rocky terrain before my poles slipped on more rocks, and I could not gain my balance before taking a side dive on the trail.  The pain in my knee was instant, severe, and debilitating.  I could not bear weight on my left leg at all.  My only choice at the time was to return to the shelter, but how would I get there?  Crawl?  Somehow, by the grace of God, I was able to lean on my trekking poles enough to support my weight, and I made it back to the shelter.  In agony, I wasted no time in popping the Ibuprofen and elevating my leg.  Now, I just wait to see if this was a temporary inconvenience or a journey-stopping event.
A couple of hours later, I attempted to walk using my trekking poles.  The pain level was much better, and I was able to take a few steps with some difficulty.  Since I knew I would not be going anywhere that day, I took my still wet tent out of the sack and spread it out in the sun to dry.   About ten minutes later, it started to rain. 
Other hikers started to come by the shelter, most of them using it only as a resting point before moving on.  One of the visitors gave me some Tylenol after learning about my injury and after I explained I had taken all but two of my Ibuprofen.  Darrell and his son Spencer opted to stay the night, although Spencer set up his tent up trail, while Darrell shared the shelter—in anticipation of more rain.  Spencer was my trail angel for the day—he refilled my water, so I did not have to make the trek to the source with my bad knee.  Dinner done and bear bags hung, I spent the next hour or so stretching my legs and hoping all would be well in the morning.  The pain had diminished considerably, but I wasn’t so sure how long that would last. ","Thomas Knob Shelter
",Wise Shelter,"Aug 20, Sun",5.20
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577112,"When morning came, I was convinced I could not continue hiking.  I could not bear any weight on the knee.  I had decided I would try to take the trail to the VA State Park Headquarters, which according to one of the hikers who stopped by the night before, was only a mile away.  There, I could arrange for transportation, if needed, to a medical clinic.  Darrell and Spencer left camp, and I packed with the intention of finding the trail to the State Park Hqs.  Problem was, I couldn’t find the trail.  Did I misunderstand the hiker—was it a mile away to the trail, or was it a mile away to the State Park Hqs?  I debated staying put for another day in the hope that someone else might be able to provide more information and/or assistance, but instead chose to keep moving forward on the trail.  The pain had abated, and it seemed I was able to bear weight on the leg.  The next shelter was only 6.7 miles away, and even at a slow pace, I knew I could make it there.  I toyed with the idea of taking a short cut by way of another trail, but opted to stay on the AT, which I understood to be a smoother path.  For the most part, this was accurate.  After clearing the rocky path that took me out the day before, the trail turned into a mucky, muddy mess from last night’s rain before eventually clearing to a trail that led through a large farm pasture.  I enjoyed eating the blueberries from the bushes alongside the trail, and chatting with a farmer who was out collecting huckleberries.  The sounds of the pasture’s residents soon caught my attention and, when I looked, I was surprised to see Texas Longhorns!!!  I asked the famer if the steer would bother me while hiking through their territory, and his response was “they shouldn’t.”  I wasn’t feeling so great about that response.  I continued forward when one of the steer decided to cut in front of me—not in an aggressive way, but more like lumbering.  It was odd seeing the four-legged, long-horned “hiker” in front of me on the trail, but I gave him his space, and he eventually crossed to the other side of the pasture.
The pasture ended at a large clearing that some referred to as a car-camping area.  The grass was neatly trimmed, there was an actual restroom/privy on the grounds, and nearby road access.   I passed through this area to the graveled road access and stopped to chat with a woman who had thru-hiked the AT in 2015 and was now re-visiting some of her favorite sections.   The encounter was brief, but her sense of humor and enthusiasm stuck with me throughout the day.
I stopped for lunch at the first inviting rock in the shade.  I welcomed the break, but the knee pain returned with a vengeance with the first step back on trail.  I sat back down and waited a few minutes to allow the Tylenol to kick in before trying again.  My supply of anti-inflammatories was dwindling.  After the first few steps, the pain was more tolerable, and I pressed on.  I was hoping to reach the opening uptrail that the Southbounders mentioned would be a good spot to witness the eclipse.  Andy, who had visited the Wise Shelter yesterday, had already forged ahead to find that opening.    
After hiking under the cover of trees for a couple of miles, I saw the opening ahead.  I scanned the area for Andy, but I didn’t see him, and I kept going.  Not long after, Andy came up from behind.  He had been at the opening, but cloud cover kept him from really seeing anything.  I looked through the special glasses he had, and I also couldn’t see anything.  Before continuing on, Andy offered—and I accepted—a handful of Ibuprofen.  The new supply would surely get me through until I could get medical attention.  Another trail angel moment.
Andy went ahead, and it wasn’t long before he was out of sight.   Not long afterwards, the sky darkened.  Was this cloud cover or the eclipse?  I tried to peek upwards through the trees; it did not appear to be cloud cover.   It felt surreal to be in the wilderness during the eclipse.  Was it my imagination, or did all wildlife come to a standstill?  I did not hear the birds, the crickets, the frogs—nothing.   It was completely silent, very ominous.
The bum knee and the darkness were not the only things that slowed my pace.  I was about a mile from the shelter when I looked ahead and saw nothing but rock trail.  I hate the rocks.  Ankles roll one way, knees the other; poles get stuck in between.  Unfortunately, rocks seem to be the norm, and if I want to hike the AT, I better just learn to deal with the terrain.  
I was glad to be at the shelter.  One Up’s message to me in the register pointed the way to blackberry bushes behind the shelter.  I took advantage of the free fruit before getting water and settling in for the night.  A couple of tenters came later and set up camp at the clearing uptrail, but I was alone in the shelter.  I wondered how many bears would be snacking on the berries behind me, but I tried not to think about that.   I slept well.

",Old Orchard Shelter,"Aug 21, Mon",6.70
Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577114,"The next shelter was only 4.2 miles away.  If, Lord willing, I could make it to the shelter beyond that—13.4 miles total—I would be just one day away from access to medical care.  The guidebook showed several road crossings, so if I could not make it the distance, then I would have options to hitch a ride into town or at least call for a shuttle.  I limped ahead.
The first opportunity to opt out was about a mile and a half from my starting point.  When I reached the road, I could see cars and trailers in a parking area about .1 miles east.  Even though I was sure I could hike on, I wasn’t sure just how much I should be pushing a bad knee, so I headed east off trail to see if I could get a ride into town. 
The parking area was also a camp area, a horse camp, and the trailers were horse trailers that easily could haul 3-4 horses.  I stopped a couple of riders to ask about getting into town and was surprised to learn that the town I thought was only a few miles away was, in fact 16 miles away—and not a straight shot.  While chatting with the riders, I noticed only a couple of cars on the road that were traveling in the direction I needed to go.  It would not have been a good use of my time to go to the road and thumb my way to town, so I returned to the trail. 
A couple of miles into the hike, a hiker behind me asked how my knee was.  It was Tenderfoot.  I first saw her yesterday, but thought she was only doing a day-hike.  Turns out, she slack packs sections.  Her husband drops her off where there is road access and picks her up at the next or other pre-determined road access location.  He fishes and sets up camp while she hikes.  Not a bad arrangement.  She offered to take me into town, but couldn’t guarantee when her husband would be at their meeting point.  I said I would look for their truck, but I might end up getting off trail sooner.  She sped by, and I trudged on. 
I reached the first shelter, but I didn’t stop in; it was .1 mi off trail, up a set of rock “stairs.”  Instead, I rested on a flat rock right off the trail and ate an early lunch.  In five miles, I would have another opportunity to break trail and get into town, so I entered the contact info in my phone for the hostel I hoped would provide shuttle service and moved on.  I came to a sign that pointed to a State Park campground and only briefly considered following that trail.  The campground was .7 miles off trail and the cost to tent for the night was more than the hostel, so it was a no-brainer to just keep going.  When I reached the road crossing, I realized this was the road where Tenderfoot was going to meet up with her husband.  Would Tenderfoot be there?  No.  There was no Tenderfoot, no other parked cars or signs of hikers, no place to rest, and no phone signal.  I walked around the entire parking area and got as close to the intersection as I could trying to pick up at least one bar—nothing.   During the time I was searching for a signal, the only vehicles that passed were a service truck that turned into the park road on the opposite side of the intersection, and a motorcycle.  Again, I returned to the trail.  I had hiked 9 miles and was wearing out.  The shelter was 4 miles away, but there was a campsite just 2 miles away, and I decided that would be my stopping point for the day. 
My already slow pace came to an abrupt stop when I encountered a massive obstacle on the trail—a huge oak tree fell onto the path, taking a rhododendron bush with it.  I thought perhaps I missed a bypass sign before this roadblock, so I backtracked a couple of hundred yards, but there was no such sign.  I couldn’t weave my way in and out and over and under the branches—I would have to go around, which meant climbing up an almost vertical hill, trying to stay upright to pass the obstacle, then sliding down back onto the trail—oh, and avoiding the wasps/bees that were searching for their home, likely buried in the tangled mess.  It took about 15 minutes to get around the debris, but at least I made it, and my knee wasn’t screaming at me for the effort.  Now my focus was on finding that blue blaze trail to the campsite. 
According to the guidebook, the campsite was a half mile after the horse trail crossing, where I took a quick break before realizing I was almost out of water.  At least the campsite would have a water source, and I knew I could make it that far, but I kept a few gulps in reserve just in case.  I was glad I did.  I missed the blue-blaze trail to the campsite, and before I knew it I saw the sign to the shelter, 1 ¾ miles away.   It was getting dark, and I was hurting, and I didn’t really think I could go on.  I kept eyeing the landscape for a suitable spot to set up camp, but everything was on a slope.  By the time I found a place that could work, I talked myself out of camping there, believing the shelter—and a water source—could not be far off.  About 30 minutes later, and with an ounce of daylight left, I finally reached the sign indicating I had reached the shelter, but it was only because of an added note in magic marker that I knew in which direction and how far I needed to go to get there.  It was only through God’s help that I made it.  To this day, I cannot understand how my knee held up for that distance.
Scott and his son Jeremy and Jeremy’s dog “Eggs” were already at the shelter.  I first met them at the Wise Shelter on the day of my injury, and I think they were as surprised as I was that I was still on trail.  We chatted a bit, I refilled my water and ate dinner and gladly accepted Jeremy’s offer to hang my bear bag with theirs.  One less thing to stress about.  
The shelter had a fireplace, and Jeremy had a fire going.  I haven’t seen a shelter with a fireplace inside since the Smokies.  It was inviting and comfortable, and I was asleep in no time. 
When morning came, the debilitating knee pain returned, but I knew I only had 10 more miles to reach the Partnership Shelter, where shuttle service would be available to take me to town.  God brought me this far, I knew he would give me the strength to keep going.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577119,"I waited until the Ibuprofen kicked in before heading out.  Today’s destination, the Partnership Shelter, was a new shelter with amenities that rivaled the Fontana Hilton.  It had a shower, potable water from a spigot, and a totally enclosed privy.  But the real bonus was the shelter’s close proximity to the Mt. Roger’s Visitor Center, where shuttle service into Marion, VA was available for only 50 cents.  My plan was to overnight at the shelter and take the shuttle to the hospital in town. 
It seemed the first five miles of the hike went quickly.  The terrain was smooth, and the sun was shining.  For much of this stretch, the trail led through open, park-like landscape.  I stopped by the Holston River to read the informational signs about limestone and loose rock river beds.  I was tempted to just dive in the fast-flowing water, but I kept my eye on the prize that was ahead. 
I leap frogged with Scott, Jeremy and Eggs for almost the entire trail.  They would rest, and I would pass; then I would rest, and they would pass.  It was fun to see the familiar faces throughout the journey.   At one point, we met up with the Ridge Runners.  We told them about yesterday’s obstacle, and they took note to check it out.   They told us more about the shelter and mentioned we would see a rock outcropping just before the shelter where we could get a good view and a phone signal.  I would be on the look out for this out cropping—not just for the phone signal, but as a sign that I would soon be at the shelter.
I parted company, but not long afterwards, Scott, Jeremy, and Eggs caught up with me.  They asked if I had seen the rattler that was on the side of the trail.  NO, I didn’t!!!  Scott was the first to spot it and backed up to allow it to cross the trail.  This was the second time a rattler had been in or near the path that I recently crossed; I wondered how many other times danger had been so close, and I just never knew about it.  In other words, how many times had God protected me from something when I never even knew I was at risk.  I hiked on with a grateful heart and a more cautious eye on the trail.
When I crossed the footbridge, I knew I only had just over a mile to go.  I started looking for the outcropping, even though I knew it would be at a higher elevation.  Every time the trail would turn or I would see a patch of sunlight through the trees, I looked for this outcropping, to no avail.  Then, I came to a huge area that looked to be the site of an expansive excavation project and, just beyond, the shelter!!  I never saw the outcropping, but this was the best view of the day! 
Scott, Jeremy, and Eggs had already settled in as was one other tenter (my apologies to him, but I forgot his name and didn’t write it down), and the resident kitty cat that I instantly named “Bones.”  Bones was not afraid to beg for food, and by the looks of it, he needed it, although I’m sure that probably had to do more with parasites than with lack of food.  The register was filled with notes from hikers who described the gourmet meals that Bones feasted on.  
Taking advantage of delivery service, the tenter and I went in on a pizza that was delivered to the Mt. Roger’s Visitor Center.  What a great finish to the day.
After dinner, I chatted with Scott and Jeremy.  Scott would soon return home to his wife and job as a pastor of a Lutheran Church and Jeremy would resume hiking after a short break with family.  He will hike to his new home in New York to pursue his dream of acting and writing.  He left a beautiful poem in the register—what talent!
I entered my message in the register, too, knowing that it would likely be my last entry for the season.  It was bittersweet.","Trimpi Shelter

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577120,"Breakfast was leisurely.  I was in no hurry to leave, and Scott, Jeremy and Eggs seemed content to extend their morning.   We sat at the picnic table chatting when who should walk in but Gram and Gramps and their parents (aka chauffeurs).  It was so cool to see them.  They hiked well ahead of schedule and arrived two days early, so they spent those two days in town, enjoying the comforts of motel living.  I updated them on my status, and Gramps left us with a little trail magic—some Gatorade and potato chip snacks!  I don’t know if Gram and Gramps will read this note, but if so, I hope they feel the virtual hugs. 
After breakfast, I went to the Mt. Roger’s Visitor Center to check the shuttle schedule.  I would plan to catch the 11:15 bus, which allowed me enough time to pack and shower.
I left the shelter and the company of my new trail friends and headed to the shuttle pick up location, then, directly to the urgent care center.  Interesting to note, that the urgent care center did not open until 4 pm!!  Who would have thought?  I hobbled to the hospital ER, which was right next door and was seen immediately.  X-rays were negative, and I was discharged with a provisional diagnosis of knee sprain with instructions to stay off my feet for 2-4 weeks, and to seek follow up if the pain continued.
I took the shuttle to the motel and updated the family on my status.  I had a number of options for returning home—A Greyhound station was nearby, I could rent a car, or I could ask someone to pick me up.  Before I could even start researching these avenues, my trail sister, Hey Jude, didn’t hesitate to offer to drive from Ohio to pick me up and take me home.  She and her friend/neighbor (now my friend, too!) Barb, came the next day.  After exploring the quaint downtown area of Marion and seeing the difficulty I had in ambulating, Hey Jude made it a priority to get me on crutches.  Duh.  Why were these not offered in the ER???  We went back to the ER, where the staff greeted me with a pair of crutches.  What an amazing difference this made in my ability to get around.  
 

About 4 ½ hours after leaving Marion, we arrived at my home in Linden. 
Hey Jude and Barb left the next day.  On 5 Sept I followed up with an orthopedic doctor, and an MRI is scheduled.  My hiking season is over for 2017, but I know that that the unexplainable appeal of the trail will nudge me until I return again, next Spring.  
To all who have followed my journey, please know how grateful I am to you for your moral support, and please check back for the continuation.

May the Lord bless you and keep you; may he make his face to shine upon you and give you peace.  Num 6:24-26.
