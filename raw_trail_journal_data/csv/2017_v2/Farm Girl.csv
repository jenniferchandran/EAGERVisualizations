Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569348,"Great start! Had a great ride to VT with my Dad.  Had lunch at s BBQ place that just might be his new favorite restaurant! Thankfully, he was up for an adventure & was willing to wait with me so that I could hit the trail between thunderstorms! Spent the night in a cool stone shelter, safe from the storm that lasted pretty much all night.  Did probably the worst job ever of hanging my food in a tree, but it's the firstbnight & it was down pouring...","Norwich VT

Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569349,"Well, food was still in the tree this am, so life is good!  I also redeemed myself tonight by a much better performance at tying a bear bag!Had an amazing day of georgeous weather and amazing views of mountains and fields filled with wildflowers and ripe wild strawberries. I'm officially in love with Vermont!","Happy Hill Shelter
",Thistle Hill Shelter,"Jun 20, Tue",8.80
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569540,"What a day! Pretty excited that a thru hiker bestowed me with a trail name this am... Farm Girl. Not shocking, huh? It all started with a discussion about bears stealing food (a hot topic here).  He said the worst bear story he has heard was about ""a place called Shaker Campsite "".  So of course I had to tell him that was in Tyringham... 
Side note, according to the story the bear followed a guy for a mile after trying to steal his pack while he was in the privy.
More amazing mountain views, beautiful fields, and some very steep climbs.  Hit the wall at about 2:30, but got thru it.  I figure that's about right as far as conditioning at the beginning of the trip.  And, despite dripping in sweat all day, a woman at the shelter tonight said, ""You smell incredibly clean, how long have you been out here?""
Definitely hilarious! Guess I need to get more stinky!!","Thistle Hill Shelter
",Wintruri Shelter ,"Jun 21, Wed",12.50
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569713,"Weather today was perfect for hiking.  Took a side trail to a place called the lookout, which was a cabin on top of a mountain with a observation deck on the roof. Could see the Whites in NH, Killington, and a bunch of other mountains that I don't know the names of. Those of you who know I don't like ladders, would be pretty impressed that I made it up & back down :)Hiked through an amazing pine forest that seemed magical.  Every time I turned the corner on a switchback, I was sure I would see a unicorn!Yesterday's experience of hitting the wall of exhaustion taught me a lot & I made myself a list of things to commit to. Not anything anyone didn't already give me good advice about, but maybe I had to live it to really, really understand.1.  Take a break.  These are the longest days of the year, there is no need to rush.2. Stop at water sources, fill up my Nalgene & drink the whole thing before getting back on the trail.  Only carry water on my back that is absolutely necessary.3. Front load on protein, don't wait until I'm hungry.4. Pack more chocolate!!","Wintruri Shelter 
",Stony Brook Shelter ,"Jun 22, Thu",10.50
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569714,"It's hard to believe how many things you can fit into one day out here!  Dodged a thunderstorm this am & still got an early start. I met a thru hiker this am who had the smallest pack I had ever seen.  He was headed 31 miles today- yep, longer than a marathon. He said base weight on his pack is 7lbs, 14 max on resupply day with food & water. He had a tattoo on his calf that read ""Miles to go..."". Incredible!The big news of the day, though is that I am ahead of schedule. I made it 17 miles to the top of Killington!!!!  I am sooo excited!  My first 4,000 ft mountain!  My first 17 mile day!Woot, Woot","Stony Brook Shelter 
",Cooper Lodge,"Jun 23, Fri",17
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569851,"Zero Day- Had an interesting night last night in the shelter on top of Killington.  Leaky roof, broken bunks, snoring Shelter mate, sudden onset of allergies (had to be mold), and a thunderstorm.  Not a lot of sleep, but boy was it amazing to watch the fog and mist just roll into the shelter.  Also met some really amazing people in the Shelter.  We all saw the humor in our sleepless night, which was a great way to start the day.Planned to take the gondola down the mountain to start my zero day, but had to walk back down the access road of the ski resort because contrary to the guidebook, you can only buy a ticket at the base of the mountain Oh well! Garrett & I will ride up it tomorrow to get back on the trail & maybe the weather will be better for seeing the view. This am, the only view was fog.Had a great day in Killington with Bill & Garrett! Ate some amazing food & did my laundry.  Cut stuff from my pack to bring the weight down & got a new sleeping pad.  The z-lite was killing me!Will be great fun to have Garrett hiking with me for the next week!!","Cooper Lodge
",Base of Killington,"Jun 24, Sat",4
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569991,"Back on the trail!  Garrett & I had a great ride up the gondola to get back on the trail. The nice man selling tickets gave me & Garrett free tickets! It turns out they should have sold me a ticket at the top :)Garrett learned the finer points of hanging a bear bag & we had some pretty amazing views.  My new 14oz sleeping pad is a dream!Just quick, I want to say something about pack weight.   The day before I headed out my pack was somehow at 38 lbs. I couldn't figure it out, I had been so careful. What did I stuff in there at the last minute?? So I ripped it apart and left fully loaded with water & 7 days of food at 35 lbs.  I was sure I needed everything in there.  After a week, I left yesterday restocked with water and 8 days of food at 32 lbs.  So, I'm making progress!!","Base of Killington
",Clarendon Shelter,"Jun 25, Sun",10.50
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570230,"Lots of hiking uphill today!  We arrived at Greenwall Shelter to find it pretty run down & with very poor water source, so we powered on the extra miles to the next Shelter. We made it with literally 7 minutes to set up our tent and gear before a big thunderstorm hit. We stayed dry, but boy did we have a wet tent!!
Cold soaked a 2 person meal & took turns standing in the rain eating it.  We thought it was a pretty funny night!  
I am always impressed by how independent Garrett is on the trail. I'm thankful for the amazing training from his Boy Scout leaders.  I hiked at about the same pace as a dad-son duo for a couple days last week & suddenly realized just how self sufficient Garrett is!  
Speaking of Boy Scouts leaders, I want to be sure to remember to say thank you to Chris J & Damian K when I get back. They taught me about the existence of ""the guy who begs for food"".  I'm pretty sure I met that guy a few days ago, and their advice worked perfectly!
One last thing before I sign off, had a pretty amazing moment today when a young guy with a prosthetic leg was cheering for Garrett from the top of hill, as Garrett was taking his turn hiking up the giant incline.
Pretty incredible place loaded with pretty incredible people.","Clarendon Shelter
",Little Rock Pond Shelter ,"Jun 26, Mon",14
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570232,"Started today ahead of schedule because of the extra miles yesterday. Had breakfast with a hiker called Snow White, which I'm guessing has to do with her beautiful white hair.  Said her son gave her a pack for Christmas & suggest she hike the AT. So with no hiking experience, off she went! She was the most joyful person I think I've ever met!  Hiked through the beginning of a section designated as a national wilderness, so not much for cell service or civilization. Hiked Baker Peak, Bear Mointain.  Tomorrow we hike Bromley, which I'm really looking forward to!Interesting night at the shelter.  We met the Loud family, who I'm pretty sure are first cousins to the Camp Run-a-Muckers!Garrett is having some real issues with his feet & may have to call the trip short.  For now, he's learned about the value of vitamin I- that's I for ibuprofen!  He is a trooper, but sometimes those crazy flat feet of his are just not his friends.","Little Rock Pond Shelter 
",Peru Peak Shelter ,"Jun 27, Tue",10.30
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570343,"Short day today- done hiking by around noon to get Garrett off his feet.  Bill & Lucy will be picking up Garrett at a trailhead 2 mi ahead tomorrow am.It's been great to have Garrett- we make a pretty good hiking team.  We've seen some pretty cool things on this trip.  Some favorites have been White Rock Mtn, where hikers have created a sea of cairns from the beautiful white rocks at the peak. Also, got to see the point where northbound thru hikers hit 500mi left.  Saw an adorable trail dog who carried his own mini z-lite sleeping pad on the outside of his doggie pack. Great views from the top of Bromley today, too.It's pretty cool to be hiking where the Long Trail and AT share the same path. Now when people talk, there's so many questions... Are u LT? AT? Thru? It feels like I'm ordering at Starbucks when I explain my official answer... I'm a southbound AT section hiker, VT border to Tyringham, MA.  Whew... a mouthful!","Peru Peak Shelter 
",Bromley Shelter ,"Jun 28, Wed",8.10
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570344,"Garrett is home safe and sound! Bill & Lucy brought me all sorts of great stuff to resupply, so now I won't need to stop in Bennington.  Next stop in town will be Dalton, MA!  They also brought me a fresh, hot, strong cup of coffee.  It was heaven!
Wrapped up a bit early today because the next 2 shelters have been having major bear problems and every thru hiker tells me not to go to them. So that means a 19.6mi day tomorrow to get past them.  Am staying in the shelter tonight because we are getting thunderstorms& will help me get an earlier start to fit in all my miles.
Interesting to watch the terrain change over time.  First there was rolling hills and fields for days. Then I transitioned to big rocks and big mountains.  Today, I seemed to transition to a big green tunnel of mud. Folks have been telling me it was coming & ive said, that's ok, I'm from MA and used to mud! Boy am I glad I'm used to it, because there is ALOT!!   And, I loved every minute of the mud slogging! Such an amazing trip!","Bromley Shelter 
",Stratton Pond Shelter ,"Jun 29, Thu",12.60
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570678,"Plan the work, Work the plan- that was my motto for today.  I knew I didn't have to be fast, I just needed to start early, be consistent, and hike all day.  And it worked!  I successfully hiked on by the shelters with bear problems for a person best in mileage.
 6:45am- I was on the trail, 8:20am- on top of Stratton Mtn, 10:15am- on the other side of Stratton & eating my snack in time to watch a bunch of super excited Boy Scouts roll out of mini vans to hike Stratton.
 Then, it was back into the big green tunnel of mud for most of the day.  The mud is so thick that I slipped and fell in it when I was literally standing still!!  The last 4 miles of the day made it all worth  it, because Glastonbury Mtn was beautiful! The trail takes you along the tree line & it is something.  They also created tent sites where it just some pines & sky.
  I made it to the shelter just in time for yet another crazy night of thunderstorms. We were squished in like sardines, all sleeping lined up side by side. In all the chaos someone took someone else's pack cover instead of their rain jacket. So one poor guy was out a pack cover & the other was in for a surprise whenever they next reached for their jacket.  I do have to say the  rain has been very... consistent.  While it has rained almost every day, it seems to only rain between 5pm & 5am, so I've barely ever had to actually hike in it.","Stratton Pond Shelter 
",Goddard Shelter ,"Jun 30, Fri",19.40
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570679,"VERMUD- now I totally get that word!!  Another whole day of mud slogging.  It's like the AT trail designers said, ""What, a flat terrain day? Let's send 'em thru the mud to make it more interesting!""  The mud even went right up to the front of the shelter!
Remember the fire swamp scene in Princess Bride when they  step into the sand pit that sucks them in?  That pretty much happened to me today, only with mud! Luckily, I haven't seen any rodents of unusual size!
Over the past couple of days, I've found more southbounders & we are a little group of 4.  One got attacked by the mud & is getting off trail today with a pretty banged up, swollen knee. One finishes in Williamstown, because she is doing the lower half of the LT, and one ends in Dalton because that is the last section of the AT he has left.  It's nice to have familiar faces to see at the shelters & along the trail.
Tomorrow I head for the MA border.  I wonder if there will be a big green sign saying, ""MA welcomes you"", like on the turnpike...","Goddard Shelter 
",Congdon Shelter,"Jul 01, Sat",14.40
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570771,"The morning started a bit rough. I'd say it was the closest I've felt to being down since I started the trip.  After another night of rain, the shelter & campsites were pretty much one big puddle. Wet & stanky shoes, wet tent, wet feet, and mud galore.  Also, I had to say goodbye to Firefly because the mud just finally got to her.  She got washed out of her tent last night & decided to hike back the 5mi to Bennington to get a hotel & a ride home, rather than fighting another day of mud to finish the southern LT.  I will really miss her.  So I decided not to let the mud get me & set a goal to go further than planned to get back over the border and out of the mud! I wish I could have made a sign for my pack that said, ""North Adams or bust"".So water & mud, ankle & sometimes shin deep motivated me onwards!  I got a little teary when I hit the MA border. Home...Bill surprised me and met me in North Adams with pizza & every kind of liquid I could have wished for, supplies, and a clean shirt! It was glorious!  I ate half a large pizza- OMG!!Fueled up, I got back on the trail for 3 more miles, which got me set for tomorrow's climb up Greylock.  Funniest thing of all... there was a group of summer camp/Boy Scouts at the shelter & they kept cheering loudly from across the campground, ""A positive attitude changes everything!""Indeed...","Congdon Shelter
",Wilbur Clearing,"Jul 02, Sun",17
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570772,"Big day! Climbed the last big mountain of my trip- Greylock.  I'm so glad I did the extra miles yesterday, because those 3 miles got me up the first 2000 feet.  The top of Greylock was beautiful and a bit foggy, and incredibly peaceful this morning. I think it was the first time that I really understood that the monument was built to honor our war heroes.
From there, it was on to Cheshire Cobbles. Yikes, that thing is steep!  Ran into somebody I used to work with on the way up & of course, he absolutely didn't recognize me until I started talking to him!  I guess that's what a baseball hat & 8 days without a shower get you!!
Home is getting so close!!!","Wilbur Clearing
",Crystal Mountain Campsite,"Jul 03, Mon",16.10
Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570855,"Happy 4th of July!!  
Cut today short because I woke up feeling pretty dizzy & ill.  I think I just dehydrated myself yesterday.  But, I got to Dalton & refueled, which helped a ton. 
The shelter site is really beautiful & the only one on my journey named after a woman, so I figure it's a fitting way to celebrate the 4th! Also, this lines me up to spend my last night on the trail at Upper Goose.  I can't wait to swim in Goose Pond & eat pancakes for my last trail breakfast!  
What a day to be on the trail!! Folks were hiking with flags on their packs, flag bandanas, and everyone was especially upbeat. At about 10am, I wished a guy happy 4th & he gave me a big smile & said, ""I've got beer! Want some?""  Only on the AT will you find a guy with a British accent, wearing a John Deere hat & offering you beer @ 10am! Since the world was already spinning around me from the dizziness, I declined.  
... What a great trip!!","Crystal Mountain Campsite

Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570953,"Today's 18miles flew by.  The weather was warm, breezy, and not humid under the tree canopy. And, my miles were mostly flat & downhill, which was pretty sweet!  I got to cross the bridges over the Turnpike, which is so surreal after almost 200 miles of woods.Upper Goose is still heaven on Earth... I took a swim, ate dinner with some awesome hikers, and am pumped for pancakes and coffee in the morning.  Tomorrow, I hike the last 7miles home to my front yard!  I can't wat to see all my boys & Daisy;  I can't wait to take a shower and sleep in a real bed;  I wonder if I'll remember how to walk without trekking poles in my hands; I can't wait to go for a run without a pack on my back and to see how many miles I can now run.  I will miss the solitude of my tent & the music of the birds and the simple, daily routine of having 1 goal for the day.  I hope I will remember what I learned out here about how kindness always wins out & that the best thing to do in life is, as they say, to hike your own hike.","Kay Wood Shelter

Farm Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571080,"After a delicious breakfast & a greeting from a porcupine, I made my way home! I always forget that Upper Goose Shelter side trail adds anothe half mile to the distance, but it's definitely worth the extra steps!  I made it home by lunch time & had the best greeting ever from Daisy!  The boys fed me an awesome lunch & I got to take a real shower!!I think I will have a ceremonial burning of my boots & socks- I can't imagine anything getting the terrible smell out of them!!  Plus, my boots have served me well over the last 2 years & they deserve a good retirement! Over 200 miles in 18 days, not bad for a lady who has celebrated her 39th birthday 5 times now!Thank you to to everyone for all the support & encouragement, the re-supplies & drop offs, & especially for the ""are you still alive?"" and ""finish strong"" text messages! Happy Trails...","Upper Goose Pond Shelter
