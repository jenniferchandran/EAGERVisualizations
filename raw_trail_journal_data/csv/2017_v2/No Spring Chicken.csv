No Spring Chicken,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548908,"In 2015 I attempted a thru hike of the AT. I got off just before Virginia. I am planning to get back on the trail in '17 where I left off. This time I will have more realistic expectations. Of course, a thru hike is the ultimate goal--and if I reach Katahdin, I can always do a flip flop. But I realize the odds are against that. So this year I plan to hike at a more realistic pace. I hope to enjoy it more without the self imposed pressures of finishing. I will hike until it is time to stop. No Spring Chicken AT '17","

No Spring Chicken,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548910,"Because I attempted a thru hike in '15, I have pretty much everything I need.   My philosophy on gear is unchanged--buy new gear only when you have to, then buy the best and lightest you can afford. Some of my gear will not be the best and the lightest because they come out with better and lighter every year. But the advantage I have is that I know what works for me. I remember a piece of advice from Conductor that has served me well--you'd be surprised what you can do without.","

No Spring Chicken,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548911,"Food on the trail is a pain. I will probably do a combo of mail drops and resupply from sources along the trail. It requires planning either way. I usually carried too much food. After a while, the only food that tastes good is town food--burgers, fries, pizza, beer... Trail food tastes like cardboard.","

No Spring Chicken,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551479,"I haven't had much to say on trail journals. I am mainly hiking with weight in my pack--hand weights, towels, books etc. Ive got my pack weight up to 32.7 lbs. I'll keep adding weight until I get up to 35 lbs, then I'll work on increasing distance. On my hikes I have run into a couple of people preparing for their first through hike attempt. They are excited and anxious to get started. We talk gear, miles, food, etc. There is almost an instant kinship, an understanding. Then we move on.Hope all are enjoying the extended fall weather. Take care all. Hope to see you on the trail. ---No Spring Chicken '17""If you can't carry it on your back or in your heart, you probably don't need it.""--Gray Owl","
