Scotty ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554498,"So if I think about it the points in favour of me doing this walk areI've been walking for a long time now , about 48yrs. Left foot , right foot , repeat as necessary!  ( I am joking no need to message me telling me it's hard )I have a 3 year old German shepherd dog called Merlin who every morning gets a five mile walk before breakfast . Recently his dad has been carrying a rucksack with 45 pounds of cat litter bags within . I don't think I'll be carrying 45 pounds on the trail ( more like 40 fully loaded) but train heavy and it will feel easier. It's also pretty hilly where we live.I have also been doing geocaching for the last five years. So a full day loaded in the country with Geo guru Whoosh12 is a regular event. We usually finish the day with beer, wine, pizza and a single malt but we feel we have earnt it.The negative list is extensive, 49 yrs old, bad feet , don't like heights, I got ambushed afews years ago by 40 pound of unsightly fat. It's not a pretty picture.I have got comfortable sat in my "" nest"" . Most guys will know what I mean. Where you sit on the sofa/ chair and the whole thing collapses around you fitting you perfectly. Beer and remote within reach. You would hear your other half shouting at you about it but you zoned out years ago and have found just saying ""yes dear"" is enough!So it's time to get out of my comfort zone and start walkingLeft/right repeat as necessary","Springer

Scotty ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554921,"So it's only a week till my flight and the preparation is pretty much done.I've read all the books, by the well known and others . One I can recommend is "" Balancing on blue"" by Keith Foskett who has thru hiked the A.T., P.C.T. , Camino de Santiago and others. Being a fellow West Sussex resident it had to be good.Like you I've read the journals, I loved "" Marmalades"" journal last year, a fellow Brit who turned a Thru hike into a pub crawl! He's currently doing the Camino de Santiago and drinking the area dry of wine.You Tube has a wealth of information but "" Red Beard's "" videos were really good.At the moment Kiwi and Reddmage are Vlogging on a daily basis so I've picked up a few tips there.I had a practice bear bagging but just got the caribiner jammed in the branch . You can see in the photo the red string and caribiner that will be stuck there for eternity. D' oh!I was bought up that bears were cute and cuddly like Yogi and Boo Boo so I've watched ""Revenant"" a few time to change that mindset.Snakes on the other hand I hate, what's with a rattlesnake? Snakes are scary enough anyway why add the rattle just to really put the fear of god up you. I'm told the bite is not deadly but if one of those rattles goes off near me I will sh*t myself translucent! My lovely daughter has created me a guide to all the nasty stinging plants that are on the trail.So all the above and knowing there's a "" slow ass moose "" behind me .I'm ready .......I think!","

Very cosmopolitan.They all left this morning to either the approach trail or Springer. Good luck to you all. And a separate good luck to the guy with the 84 pound pack; you read that right!

I walked with Cody and El Vago who were at the shelter with me. We looked up at the falls and thought how lovely and yet how stupid but we had those steps cracked in 45 mins.

Met up with Cody at Coopers gap and dropped the packs for a break.There were numerous cars parked there and we watched as a Thru hiker in his 60's arrived and went from car to car begging food as he had run out and was ""bonking"". He had no luck and asked us so I gave him a bar as did someone else.I found out later he was writing a book on doing the AT by begging food alone. Prat! I thought he was ill!!! El Vago and I have named him "" Sponge Bob"" as he is sponging off people. Stay tuned as I met him again and had words.We walked the day and as all the info I had, said no water from Justice creek we all filled up. I wanted a full wash down and protein drink. I carried 7 litres 1.5 miles to the shelter to find there was loads of water at the shelter.

I had a word about his tricks which he just replied it's "" Yogi'ing"" and smirked. Utter prat!We hiked on and all met up at Woody gap for lunch.

I walked out with El Vago into the fog, the boot tree looked eerie in the mist! We climbed into the mist and clouds, for hours we could only see bare trees and a muddy pathway. The rain was constant with driving wind. We got to Low gap shelter which was packed and set up in the rain.I did all the chores that needed doing like filter water and then cooked food with Cody in the lea of the shelter.

Packed away my wet tent and had a hot breakfast which is a great moral boaster. The sun came out as Cody and I started walking. We covered the first five miles easily and Cody spotted a great spot for "" 1st lunch"" I'm started to feel like a hobbit with food. We sat there spotting birds of prey eating for half an hour when a young fit fella name of Patrick joined us. Nice guy.Windwalker happened along as we were leaving but he's quick so he left us. The last 2.5 miles was horrible and all rocks. We got to Blue mountain shelter which had rubbish everywhere so we collected what we could. The sun dried all our kit and I had a great flat spot for my tent which was great.Cody and Windwalker got a fire going and in the end there was only about ten in and around the shelter.

El Vago and I were last out but only took an hour to hit Unicoi gap where the guys had called for a shuttle into town. We got picked up by Jon, an old guy who got us to sign the roof of his van in marker pen. He dropped us at the Helendorf hotel where we checked in but couldn't get into our room for a couple of hours. They did let us hit the breakfast bar ... nice, second breakfast!We checked out the town and picked up some supplies from a classic store. I got some whiskey jerky , sorry Kris it's not Speyside but it is good Grabbed our room, I drew the short straw as I'm with El Vago and we have found he snores like a Grizzly bear with piles. You feel safe on the mountains as no other bear would dare come near.We tried to rename him ""Snorelax"" but he's not having it.

Dropped off till 7am when it was time for first continental breakfast at the hotel. We walked down to a lovely Christian family restaurant for cooked 2nd breakfast. We got a free shuttle back to Unicoi gap in the back of a pick up, El Vago looked so uncomfortable in the rear; cold, windswept and avoiding the cat poop in the rear. We started a hard climb of Tray mountain which had some amazing views at the top. We got to the shelter about 14.30 which was full already. We met up with Two Step and Doctor Stretch again who we hadn't seen for a few days. The shelter was near the top of the mountain and as the wind was howling it was an early night and a read.I'm still stunned that after hiking for over a week in all these forests, I have seen the sum total of two squirrels Life is good","Unicoi gap

I have used a tent ""pee"" bottle for years and both Cody and Windwalker converted days ago but El Vago is a gentleman and resisted ... resistance is futile! The freezing wind at 2am getting out for a quick pee was too much for him. He's now getting a pee bottle. The plan was a quick 11 miles and into Hiawassee and two nights at the Holiday inn for a zero.Kelly's knob at over 4000 ft was in the way. I found myself trying to push the miles out so on went the ear phones, AC/DC Ironman album on the iPod and I was flying. I hit the gap at 1330 to find lovely people from the local baptist church doing trail magic. I was starving. Bumped into Tractor as we were eating and chatted.

Scotty ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563330,"So for a number of weeks I have found the actual act of walking on the trail for around eight hours a day , mind numbingly boring. You have to focus on the ten feet of trail in front of you as the rocks and roots will jump up and get you the moment you look away. That ten feet looks exactly the same in GA, NC, TE or VA.
I tried music, mind games and all manner of things but I was just bored solid. Once it creeps into your mind you have had enough it just grows and grows ( especially if your bored ) So phone calls were made and flights booked. Two Greyhound coachs and two flights later and I was home. That was a little over a week ago. 
I completed 518.5 AT miles and I'm pleased with that. Overcome mountains and every form of severe weather including a blizzard ( mild snow storm for Vago ) and meet some amazing people ( a few strange ones as well ) . To everyone that read this journal and signed the guestbook my thanks.
