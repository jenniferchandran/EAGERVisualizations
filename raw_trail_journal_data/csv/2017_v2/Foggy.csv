Foggy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554346,"I first caught the AT thru-hiking ""bug"" back in 1999 when I co-led a youth trip on the AT. We hiked the last 50 miles or so over 5 days, ending at Mt. Katahdin. Our leaders were former thru-hikers themselves and planned this trip as a fun and meaningful experience for the five teens who were in our charge. We met a few thru-hikers and they seemed to us like a rare but friendly breed in themselves. They happily relieved us of any spare food we had, it being the last half of the 100 mile wilderness and all. My 14 year old son was one of the youth on this trip. I know it made a big impression on him, because he thru-hiked in 2010. His stories combined with my own impressions from the youth trip planted the seed, and so here I am, about to embark on my own adventure of a lifetime.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Wed",0

I had taken a class at REI on AT thru-hike preparation, and the instructor said you should buy your backpack last (after you have all your gear that needs to go in it), but most people make the backpack the first purchase. That was true for me too. I have a Gregory Baltoro 65 and somehow I'll have to make it work. Just a little over a month before I leave for Georgia.

Not sure how that will translate to hiking exactly but it all good cardio, right?I also got to do a little cross country skiing which I missed last year because it was kind of a bust snow-wise. In the last outing I managed to irritate the skin on my heel, and got to practice good foot care afterwards by applying moleskin on it. I also went shopping for typical groceries so I could gauge the weight vs. calorie content.

First off, most if not all of what I plan to write about is not for my fellow thruhikers; they know all too well of this Experience we share. No, my intended readership is family and friends, on whom I hope to impart some understanding of the day to day. And also for me of course, to have something to look back on. Although I am now in Franklin,North Carolina, my recollection of a lot of the Georgia hiking was a series of gaps and knobs. Georgia, and for all I know, most of the AT, is like this. As the trail winds through the hills, at some points there are creases in the landscape known as gaps. Some of these have paved roads, others have unpaved Forest service roads, and still others are deep in the woods. The nice thing or bad thing depending on your hiking preferences is that the trail leading into gaps is downhill, which of course means the trail leading out is uphill. Some gaps are frequented by Trail angels ( more on that later). The knobs are often good places to get a good view of the area, at least in nice weather. So on a daily basis I might go thru several gaps and knobs on my journey. Gaps are good places to drink water, eat a candy bar, etc. to provide energy for the upcoming climb. Knobs are where at least for me, I need to stretch before beginning my descent in order to prevent knee injury. 
So yeah, gaps and knobs.","Hightower Gap

Foggy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557335,"This post is for my new friend Pat from Houston (Trail name Howdy) who I met a few days ago at Neels Gap while Trail magic was being bestowed on us. He must have seen I was hiking alone and he asked me if I wanted to share a cabin that he had reserved for the night to save on the cost. I hesitated and asked him to let me think about my options but the Hiker Hostel was full and I was not planning to hike any more that day so really the options were limited. My hesitation may have been partly cost driven ( I had just stayed two nights in a hotel in Dahlonega waiting out the cold weather) and partly the fact that this was a complete stranger, but then again we generally all were strangers. I hemmed and hawed. He said ""look man, you are over thinking it"" and I realized he was right. For those who know me, that pretty much sums up how I deal with a lot of decisions!
Pat said he was just hiking a small section of the AT to check out his gear in preparation for a scouting event later this year as well as an eventual thru hike. We hiked and camped together for the next few days and he decided to head home today. I really enjoyed hiking with you Pat and valued your good advice about everything hiking related. I wish you all the best. If you are ever in the Boston area look me up (after September).","Tray Mountain

Foggy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562990,"Our dear friend Meg has asked some questions about the thru hiking experience. One has to do with the interaction with other hikers. I think for most, thru hiking is a solitary experience. There are certainly exceptions, for example I have met father/daughter pairs, one father/son pair, couples, siblings, and friends who have come to hike the trail together. Some who have met on the trail have decided to hike together at least for a stretch, for various reasons. One good reason which I have taken advantage of is sharing a room to save money when staying in a trail town. At shelters, campsites and trail towns which need to be visited in order to get food and other supplies, I often see the same people at least for a week or two. Conversations usually include topics like gear, food, trail conditions, aches and pains, or what ever happened to so and so. Deeper discussions are rare since I never really know if I will see this person again.","

We met two unsuspecting trail angels when we arrived at Big Meadows Campground. Big Meadows is located on Skyline Drive and has many RV sites as well as tenting sites, and the AT is directly adjacent to it. Four of us were renting a site for the night since it was so convenient. After we setup our tents, we introduced ourselves to Suzanne and her daughter Meg from D.C. who were camping for a couple of days with their two dogs. Since the camp store and Wayside were almost a mile away, we asked Suzanne if it might be possible to get a ride there and back. She not only obliged us but also offered to give us another ride in the morning. She also offered hotdogs which we gladly accepted. The biggest gift was the kindness and genuine interest she showed in our individual and collective AT stories. Thank you Suzanne!","Mile 913.8

After a time of celebration and photos at the summit, we (Tyler, Emma, Persistent and I) hiked down via the Knife Edge and Helon Taylor Trail to Roaring Brook Campground, where Carolee was waiting for us with cold beer and warm hugs for all.
