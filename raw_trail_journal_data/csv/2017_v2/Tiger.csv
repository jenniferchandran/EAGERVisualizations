Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539413,"After telling my family and close friends of my plan to thru-hike over the last few weeks, I announced it publicly earlier this week (made it ""Facebook official""), so I guess it's time to start the journal. I've been thinking about this hike for so long, though, that it now seems so much closer than 270 days away. I keep wanting to make plans, book an airline ticket, get Hiker Hostel reservations, etc. that I have to remind myself that nine months is still a long way away and I have plenty of time to get everything done. But that's how I am, especially with travel, I love researching it and booking it and getting ready. So I gotta slow down and take a breath, I guess. It's my hope that writing this journal will help with that, but it's probably more likely that it will just make me want to do more.I figured I'd spend the first few entries addressing the main questions I'm getting. I've been reading trail journals for a few years and seems like the question everyone gets the most is why they're doing it, why they chose to pick themselves up out of their own life like a giant stuffed toy claw game and drop themselves into a totally different life for half a year. Surprisingly, I've not gotten that hardly at all. I'm actually fairly amused at the question I'm receiving the most, but I'll leave that for journal entry #2 (teaser!)So how did I get here, to this decision, to a hike as big as this? Back when I was in high school, my family took a spring break vacation to the Smokies. While we were up along the TN/NC border, we came across a couple gentlemen thru-hiking the AT northbound. I'd never heard of such a thing before and I remember being flabbergasted at how one person could carry five months of food on their back (I clearly didn't know about resupplies then). The experience of learning about their hike didn't make an immediate impression on me, but it stuck, lying dormant in my head for years. Until about three years ago, that is. I couldn't tell you what brought it back up. I've always been a fan of hiking, but something in me started getting me into backpacking and brought back up the trail. I started feeling called to the trail, much in the same way people speak of feeling called by a spiritual being. I threw myself into researching the trail, learning everything I could about it, following 2015 and 2016 trail journals, building out my gear kit piece by piece. I didn't know when I'd do it, or even if I would, but I prepared as though I was always just a few weeks away from Springer.Then, in March of this year, I brought it up with my wife. She knew that I'd been thinking about the trail, but this was the first time we discussed me actually doing it. We're at a good spot in our lives with not a lot of life changes: no kids, steady jobs, in love with the house, cars aren't due for replacement. So perhaps this is an okay time to do it. It's tough, though, because I knew she likely would not do it with me and asking your partner, your best friend, to be apart for that long... there's never really an ""okay"" time for that. It would suck now and it would suck later. That's certainly going to be the hardest part of this, for both of us. I hear the trail is way more mentally challenging than physically challenging and I 100% believe that. I was ecstatic when she said we could figure out a way to make it work and she would support me chasing this crazy dream.So here we are. I've requested, and gotten approval for, a leave of absence from work starting in March 2017 to hike the AT. It's real now, which probably won't hit me until I head to the airport to catch a flight to Atlanta. So to answer the question everyone else gets: why? Pretty simple, really. I don't have a deep spiritual reason, I'm not searching for answers... I want a huge accomplishment. I want to do something no one else I know has done and say ""can you believe I did that?!"" I love being on the move, whether that's hiking or flying somewhere for work or road tripping with my wife. I love searching out adventure and beauty in the world. I have a passion for hiking and what a hike this is. I want to stand on that sign on Katahdin and I want to walk all the way there from Georgia.So I will.",,View Entry,"Jun 23, Thu",0
Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539833,"I mentioned in my last entry that I'd use this one to address to the question I've been getting the most. I thought I'd be asked ""What made you decide to do this?"" over and over, but I was surprised (and kind of amused) at the question I'm actually getting the most. The first thing people seem to want to know upon hearing of my hike is some variation of ""Who is going with you?"" or ""Are you hiking alone?""
As other thru-hikers know, this is kind of a complex question with no straightforward answer. Really? I know, right? Sounds like a simple question: yes/no, are you going by yourself? Well... it really depends on how you ask.
Question wording #1: ""Who is going with you?""
I think I know generally why people ask this: to determine if my wife is going with me. She is not, nor are any family members or friends. When I get to the airport next March, I will board the plane with no one I know, I will catch a shuttle to the trailhead with no one I know, and I will step through the arch at Amicalola Falls State Park with no one I know. In that sense, I will be alone. However...
Question wording #2: ""Are you hiking alone?""
No, not at all. Eh? But you just said... I know, I know, hear me out! From the beginning of March until well into May, a ""bubble"" of hikers summits Springer Mountain and starts heading towards Maine every single day. During the week, it may only be a dozen or two over the course of the day, but on weekends it could be upwards of 100 hikers beginning their thru attempts. (This is a big part of the reason I'm starting on a Tuesday.) For the first few hundred miles, into and beyond the Smokies, shelters and campsites are packed with hikers. A lot of these folks will eventually leave the trail for one reason or another -- only about 25% of those who start a thru-hike finish it -- but I'll still be seeing people nearly the whole trail. One can hike alone the whole way, but it takes work to do it, and I'll almost certainly fall into a ""trail family"" or two and hike with them all the way to Katahdin. The AT is a social place.
In reality, though, even if I was the only person on the trail, I will never be hiking alone. I have a wonderful group of people who will be cheering me on every step of the way. So, like any good novel, I must start out with acknowledgements.
A sincere thank you...
...to my wife, to whom I cannot be more grateful for supporting me in this dream. I know what a huge sacrifice I'm asking of you and I am extremely appreciative that you're willing to take on this challenge together. It means everything to me.
...to our families. We're probably gonna lean on you guys a lot next summer, and I'm glad I can count on you always being there for us, with this or with anything else. You're awesome.
...to my friends. Feel free to come visit and hike on the trail. If you can't, I hope this journal allows you to be with me in spirit.
...to my team at work, who not only supported me taking some time to go do this, but actively encouraged the adventure. I'm lucky to work with such great people at an awesome company. And finally...
...to those who have gone before me and shared their journeys, especially Rock Boat and Cambo from the class of 2015. If my journal is half as good as yours are, I'll consider that a resounding success. Also to 3D and (fellow Missourian!) Obsolete, who both reached out to me personally after their hikes -- I haven't taken either up on their offers, but their journals were more helpful to me than they know.
I'm extremely lucky to have so many amazing people in my corner. I can't wait to share this hike with you all.",,View Entry,"Jun 27, Mon",0
Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547317,"I've had a bunch of random semi-trail-related thoughts floating around my head recently, so here they all are, and maybe even in a somewhat coherent order!First off, this is my third journal entry, so I'm now Trailjournals official. The journal has been here since I started it, but I'm now (or should be) listed in the roster of 2017 AT hikers. So... welcome new readers! Grab a chair and stick around for a while. I've written a couple previous entries much more thoughtful than this one and you can take a look at all my gear using the link on the left. It'll be a little slow for the next couple hundred days, but once I'm on the trail, not only will you have daily entries but I promise at least 7-8% of them might be interesting too!I ran that calculation of T-minus 203 days just this morning and I'm honestly kind of surprised at how far away it still seems. I've just been working on plans for years and years now that I'm so much further along than I otherwise would be this far out and so it feels much closer than that. I mean, you could start and end a thru-hike and still have a month left before I even head to the airport. I haven't bought a plane ticket yet—that purchase button on Southwest's website is like a big, giant ""OMG IT'S REAL NOW"" button which I'm still getting up the nerve to click—but it's looking more and more like Tuesday, March 21st will be my start date. So 203 days it is.Speaking of ending a thru, congrats to the class of 2016! I followed fewer journals this year than last year, but five so far have finished up (Coach, Portage, SlipKnot, Rabbit, and Mountain Goat). I'm also following a video blog for the first time ever (Spielberg), which I'm really enjoying quite a bit more than I thought I would. I wasn't sure if I wanted to actually see all the neat sights before I got out there, but it's been fun to follow along. I have a really, really horrible episodic memory, so perhaps this is a situation where I can use it to my advantage and forget all the great views I saw in the videos!What else.... oh, I've picked a trail name. I went back and forth on this so many times, debating whether I should let the trail provide one or take my own. I kinda settled on a compromise, starting with one, but I'm open to changing it if this one doesn't really stick and/or a better one comes along while I'm out there. This one means a lot to me however, as I'm an alumnus of the University of Missouri and a huge huge huge Mizzou football fan, and it is also surprisingly uncommon with past hikers as far as I could tell. Double bonus. So for now... I'm Tiger. (M-I-Z!)In training hike news, my wife and I gave packrafting a shot the other day, with limited success. We like hiking and we like paddling, but put them together and it becomes a horrible sandwich of awfulness. We started out with a five mile hike on the Ozark Trail through a conservation area. As far as AT gear, I had my Exos backpack with me at least, but nothing else from my list; just two rafts, four paddles, two PFDs, an air pump, and lunch. We clearly planned well with our shorts and lack of bug spray as I hiked through Chigger corporate headquarters and my wife went through the executive offices of their closest competitor, Seed Tick Industries. We finally made it to the river, ate a quick lunch, then pumped up the rafts, all the while longingly watching groups arrive by bus, carrying coolers no doubt full of delicious beverages and hopping into kayaks and canoes already set up and waiting. We crammed ourselves and our gear into rafts barely big enough for an unladen sixth grader and set off. If it's your goal to spin in circles down a river, running into every fallen tree along the way, I can't recommend the Intex Explorer 200 raft enough. The above-average durability removes some of the ""will this be the underwater log that finally sinks me?"" excitement, but the total lack of control just screams thrill-ride. I've never been so happy to come to the end of a float trip in my life. After a week of itchy insect bite hell, our sunburns are now peeling and we hope the dozens of red spots left over from the bites will disappear sometime in the next couple of weeks. My next training hike will be in a state park, well away from major waterways.The picture at the top of this post was taken right as we began our hike (you can tell it was before, because I'm smiling). If you generally know what I look like, you'll notice I'm wearing glasses, something I generally don't do. I've needed vision correction for about 20 years now, but for the last 15 or so it's been almost exclusively from contact lenses. I'd planned on carrying solution and a case with me while on the trail, which isn't the most hygienic of places to be sticking one's finger in one's eye but has worked decently well for me on past trips. However, I'm in a good situation with insurance at my current employer and, after inquiring about it my last few eye appointments, I decided to look into Lasik. I have a consultation this Saturday to determine if I'm a good candidate; if all goes well, I hope soon thereafter science is shooting laser beams into my eyeballs and I can leave a couple toiletry kit staples behind permanently. Fair warning, I plan to get a lot of mileage out of the ""pretty drastic stuff to cut a few ounces of pack weight, eh?"" jokes.I mentioned before that I've pretty well populated the gear list section. I have just about everything but the tent at this point. In a decision I'm sure to second guess for the next six months, I shifted away from my planned Tarptent Protrail and now plan to carry a Nemo Hornet 1-person tent. A slight weight penalty, but I get side entry, double wall, and semi freestanding, all of which I think will increase my comfort in a not-insignificant way. I dropped some weight in my cookset and by switching out my synthetic sleeping bag for the down version, so it's actually a net negative over the past month. (Completely unrelated note: anyone want to buy a Nemo Rhythm 25 synthetic sleeping bag?)Okay, I think that's enough for now. I've been catching up with a lot of friends recently and they all have been pretty interested in my hike, which is super cool. Though I'm sure it gets old for the people who are around me a lot, I love talking trail and am more than happy to answer any and all questions people have. I've mentioned a few already and I'll cover plenty more in future entries I'm sure. If you have something you want answered, feel free to sign my guestbook or send me an e-mail.

Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551114,"Getting closer! Only 140 days to go, most of which through the holidays I'm sure are going to fly by. I've been spending the last couple of months wrapping up my preparations, putting the finishing touches on my gear list and getting travel squared away. Speaking of travel, I can say for sure that it's 140 days to go because I booked my flight for Monday, March 20th and will take my first step through the arch at Amicalola Falls State Park the next morning. (I'm from St. Louis... I think I'm legally required to walk through an arch to start my hike.)
So let's start with the flight, and a quick story of how absurd I can be. If I haven't mentioned it already, I used to travel a lot more business and quite enjoyed it (the actual traveling part, at least; the same boring hotel rooms in the same boring suburbs can really wear on you after a while). When it came time to look at flights, I quickly narrowed it down to two choices: a direct flight to Atlanta on Southwest, or a 3 hour layover in Philadelphia on American for $30 more, a flight which I was leaning towards. Why on earth, I hear you thinking, would any relatively normal person pay more to connect in a city no closer to the destination than when they started?? Why, a cheesesteak, of course. Okay, it actually sounds really silly now that I'm typing it out, but if I'm going to start what is basically a five-month vacation and have to buy a flight anyway, I might as well start it off right with one of my favorite meals, yeah? Also I loathe Southwest, but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, with my mouth watering for Chickie's & Pete's crab fries, I logged on to American's website to book my flight and had my heart smashed to bits (I'm dramatizing here but stick with me) when I found the price of the flight had jumped by nearly 50% from the day before. Alas, it was not meant to be. Southwest, in all their extreme overjoyfulness, heard my cries and found it fitting to start their fall sale the exact same day, dropping their flight price by nearly 50%, putting the final nail in my Cheez Whiz coffin. Direct to ATL it is.
Okay, that was too long, let's breeze through the rest. Gear talk. Since my last update, I bought my tent: a Nemo Hornet 1P. It packs smaller and lighter than I ever thought possible, and I instantly knew I'd made a good decision. I took it out on a recent camping trip to practice setting it up and, other than a stiff breeze wanting to carry it away, it sets up really quickly and easily. I did have to e-mail Nemo about the footprint to figure out how to connect it, but we got that solved and I'm even happier about my choice. Sawyer customer service also did me a solid and sent a replacement cap for my Squeeze filter since the one that came with it was deformed and leaked. I also replaced my rain jacket, picking up a Mountain Hardwear Plasmic Ion (in bright green! whoo!) on sale from Campsaver. With that, and some birthday items like a Therm-a-Rest sit pad, my gear list is basically complete. All that's left is AWOL's guidebook, my homemade first-aid kit, and some sunscreen.
In my last update, I mentioned that I was getting a Lasik consultation to see if I was a candidate and could get the surgery. Well... I was and I did. About five weeks ago, I bid farewell to contacts for the last time and had modern technology laser my eyes back into shape. All of the different medicated drops were a bear, but now my eyes are basically back to how they felt before the surgery except that I can see the clock in the morning. Being able to see things from bed was actually the weirdest part and took me a lot longer to get used to than I thought it would. But I'm very glad I did it, and I can't tell you how insanely happy I am that I won't be sticking my dirty fingers into my eyes twice a day out in the woods.
Last thing for now. In previous entries, I covered some of the questions I've been getting from people, but we have a new leader in the clubhouse. I'm getting asked quite a lot about whether I'll be doing any training before the trail. Honestly... probably not. I know that I should and that doing something would likely increase my chances of summiting Katahdin, but I'm kinda lazy and definitely a procrastinator, so if I'm being completely honest with myself, I might do a few extra P90X yoga sessions and a weekend or two in the woods, but I'd be lying if I said I was going to buy a gym membership and start hitting the treadmill.
While I'm here being honest with myself, I think that lazy and procrastinator thing is going to be my biggest challenge on the trail, even more so than the physical aspects. I want to walk up that mountain badly enough to overcome it, but definitely something I'm going to have to be aware of the whole time. Hold me accountable, yeah?",,View Entry,"Nov 01, Tue",0
Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553547,"My 2017 AT Guide arrived in the mail yesterday. With that, I now have everything I need to take that first step from Springer. A quick trip to the grocery store and I could conceivably leave tomorrow. I still have a few things I want to do, like Insect Shield some of my clothes and have a couple ramen test runs with my cookpot, but yeah… I’m ready.Flipping through the guidebook last night was fun, but kind of overwhelming. Or surreal. Or something. The book is smaller than I pictured, but the information inside is so much bigger. I read somewhere (Reddit?) that it can take three days just to hike the first page. Yikes. The planner in me wants to chart out the whole trail, but I’ve limited myself to only figuring out up to Neel Gap. Beyond that, the trail will provide. I can’t be thinking of Pennsylvania while I’m still not even to North Carolina, so I’m going to set some small goals along the way. First up: get to the Smokies.I don’t have a whole lot for this entry, but I wanted to put something up to round out the pre-hike stuff. This will probably be my last entry before I leave, two months from today. The next few weeks are full of trips to visit friends and family. January has already passed by pretty quick; I imagine February and March will as well, if not faster.See you in Georgia.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Fri",0
Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556252,"Getting close! I spent much of the weekend visiting family on the Goodbye Tour 2017 and gathering up all my gear in one place. And once I did that, I had to take the traditional gear pic, of course.
A few things you eagle eyes might notice are missing:
-Stove: it's in the cookpot (which is in that orange mesh thing)
-Water filter: I keep my filter in the little mesh pocket on my pack's shoulder strap, and I forgot to move it into view.
-TP: not bagged up yet, but I will not be forgetting this.
I haven't packed it all up and weighed it (that's tonight) but my rough calculations say base weight should be around 18-19 lbs. I might shed some of those pounds early by sending home the rain pants after the Smokies, and I'll see how long my Kindle and camp shoes make it before I decide they're dead weight. Also debating the necessity of the fleece if I have my rain jacket, but that's something I can figure out on the trail.
Side note: My clothing system is almost entirely based on Andrew Skurka's Core 13. If you're planning on hiking anywhere in the US anytime soon, I highly recommend reading it.
I did weigh my food however, and it came out to 7.75 lbs, which is much lighter than I thought, considering I'm taking my entire three-week stash of Clif Bars. On the menu for the first few days: pop-tarts, Clif Bars, granola bars, beef jerky, trail mix, ramen noodles, and M&Ms. I'm in junk food heaven.

Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557059,"After a quick weekend of packing everything up, enjoying a bon voyage steak dinner with my wife, and unloading two thousand pounds of landscaping stone into my front and back yard, the day has finally arrived. I left my house this morning not with my work laptop, but with a 28 lb backpack full of everything I need for the first 38 miles of my hike. My pockets didn't hold my keys but a water filter and a lighter (the first lighter I've ever bought, I think).It was really tough saying goodbye to my wife and dog this morning. My dog was out eating grass in the backyard this morning, which he does when his stomach is upset -- he's pretty intuitive, so I'm sure he knew something was up. The goodbye at the airport was really hard as well. The mental piece of the hike is starting already and I haven't even seen a white blaze yet.The plane ride was fine, I snagged a window seat but all three of us in my row were broad shouldered guys; it was tight quarters. I missed the drink cart, too. I never miss the drink cart! A rare misstep. Wasn't asleep, just had my headphones in and wasn't paying attention, I guess. No Coke Zero for me. I had some time to kill before I needed to catch the MARTA train northwards. The Hiker Hostel was picking up a group of us and there were some fellow hikers about an hour and half behind me. I hadn't planned lunch, so I bought a Smartwater (which will be my water bottle for the hike) and some veggie straws from a newsstand in the terminal. Luckily there was a TGI Friday's right at baggage claim. Thankfully, as I had no idea what was at my destination train station (nothing, as it turns out) and I wasn't super into just sitting there for two hours.Oh, I forgot, this place is so much bigger than STL that they have one of those mini people mover trains in between terminals. I walked the first one, because, well, walking is what I do now, but it took about 5-6 minutes just to go from C to B, and I had three more to go before baggage claim. I jumped the next train. One more day of laziness :-DDuffy from the HH came to pick up me, another Andrew (trail name: Rabbit Hole), and Anna. We made a quick stop at Walmart for dinner (Subway for me) and then got the tour and our bunks for the night. The Hiker Hostel is a really nice place, with a full kitchen, grill, a helpful staff that has thought of everything. We've been told to temper our expectations for future hostels...There are quite a few people here tonight, maybe a dozen and a half or a little more. I'm decent with names but there are a bunch I haven't caught. Chris, Troy (who I think should be called John Malkovich), Mike (44), May (""like the month""), a Turkish guy from outside DC...It's been a really nice day and a really nice night hanging out on the back porch. I can see the mountains in the distance, which is something I definitely don't see in Missouri. Early breakfast tomorrow, and then off to the approach trail (which it seems like hardly anyone here is doing).","Saint Louis

Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557134,"I got some decent sleep last night and some not so decent. I kept waking up thinking it *has* to be 6:30 this time, but it didn't come around until the sixth or seventh time (at least). My alarm finally went off and I took what will probably be my last shower until Saturday.We had breakfast, eggs and French toast and grits!, and then put the final touches on all our packs. We then divvied up into groups to head out for the trailhead. Only three of us were headed to Amicalola Falls State Park, where the 8.8 mile Approach Trail heads to Springer Mountain. Dan, from Rhode Island, Jurgen from Stuttgart, and I got to the visitor's center and registered our thru hike. I'm hiker #1067 for the year. A lot more than I expected at this time in March -- gonna be a busy season!The Approach Trail starts with a paved path up a deceptively step hill, then come the stairs. Oh the stairs. Six hundred of them, to be exact. I was sucking wind all the way, but I made it in about 35 minutes. My legs felt good, it's the cardio I need to work on. That's a fantastic sign, the lung capacity will come easier than new legs.There was another uphill after the top of the falls, and once we got up to the ridge, the sun came out and stayed out. It was brutally hot, and the trail never seemed to go on the side of the mountains on which the sun wasn't shining. If I was sitting outside at a winery, it would've been a gorgeous day, but for hiking, I'm totally blaming the heat on my slowness.I made a terrible rookie mistake (get them out of the way early, I guess) and didn't top off my water at the top of the falls, so I got really close to running out about halfway through the trail, right before a huge 500' climb. Dumb, dumb, dumb. I finally came across a spring about three miles later and just sat there for about 20 minutes chugging spring water. I'm learning I need a lot more water than I think.I came across Jurgen and Dan at the Black Gap Shelter right after the spring. We sat for a bit and then decided to make the final push up Springer Mountain, 500' in about a mile and a half. Peanuts for hikers in better shape than me, I'm sure, but it was super tough in the middle of the afternoon with a heavy pack. I had some Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! going from the spring, so I'd listen to that for a while, stop and chat with Jurgen and catch my breath, put the headphones back in and repeat, all the way up.We finally (finally!) summited Springer about 4:00, an hour or two later than I had initially expected, but this approach trail was a massive wake up call. We signed the register and got the obligatory ""first blaze"" pictures. (The Appalachian Trail is blazed with white paint marks, two by six inches, all the way to Maine except in areas above treeline.) I would've liked to spend more time there, but thunder started rolling right as we got there, so Jurgen and I threw our packs back on and walked the 0.2 miles to Springer Mountain Shelter. Were it not for the threat of rain, he might've headed on to the next shelter but I was toasty toast and had already made up my mind to stay.The shelter here is pretty cramped quarters, so I found a spot behind it to set up my tent. The thunder continued to rumble, but I was able to get set up, filter water, eat dinner, meet a bunch more hikers, and hang my food all before the drizzle started. The radar looks like it shouldn't be a huge storm -- I'm perfectly content with light rain and thunder in the distance.Today was definitely humbling, and I've had to reconsider my first few days, but I'm having a great time and very much looking forward to the big downhill to start tomorrow!","Hiker Hostel
",Springer Mountain Shelter,"Mar 21, Tue",0.20
Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557342,"Hoo boy. What a night. A huge storm blew through last night, right across the top of Springer. It started with just rain, but around 8:30 we just got nailed. Horizontal rain, wind gusts upwards of 60 mph... At first, the wind sounded like ocean waves, as if I was camped on the beach right next to them. It picked up after that and I definitively heard that freight train sound people talk about when a tornado passes by. (I learned later that there apparently was a tornado warning...yikes.) Because the shelter had looked cramped the night before, I had chosen to set up my tent. Riding out the storm in my tent... it was a sheer terror I've never before experienced in my life. I talked with Katie for at least a half hour when it started before I put in headphones and listened to podcasts to take my mind off of it. I finally was able to get some sleep around midnight; the wind hadn't really died down but the rain had stopped.I was still super freaked out when I woke up, so I got up with my alarm at 7, slammed a poptart, and shoved all my wet gear into my pack. I raced the mile down Springer Mountain and hung out at the parking lot, waiting on the Hiker Hostel shuttle to bring the morning's departing hikers, fully intending to end right then and there and shuttle back to the airport. The brutalness (is that a word?) of the approach trail and the hellish storm... mentally I could not go through that again, especially not voluntarily. Jurgen came down the mountain maybe a half hour later, and I explained my plan to him. He encouraged me to go on, as he needed ""his guide"" to show him where all the water stops were (he hikes with The Thru-Hikers Companion and I hike with AWOL's guidebook). Knowing that I was leaving, I gave him my guidebook and a fist bump and wished him well. ""The worst is behind us,"" he said, and walked on.I tried to call Katie but couldn't get service. We exchanged some texts as I waited for the shuttle. About 9:45, maybe ten to fifteen minutes before the shuttle arrived, I threw my rain jacket on and started walking.The other side of Springer is like an entirely different state. It was a gorgeous valley of pine forest and what I think is rhododendron. I was walking by a creek most of the time and just listening to it was very peaceful. I find the parts that I enjoy around here are all around water, walking by it, stopping to filter it. I made Stover Creek Shelter in record time and asked a group around there if they'd seen Jurgen. I was about five minutes behind him but they told me his destination. I walked on and stopped to filter water when Dan came up behind me. We walked together for the rest of the afternoon.About halfway through the day, the trail rose out of the valley and turned back into hardwood forest, which is what the approach trail is. I'm somewhat ashamed to say this but I really don't enjoy the hardwood forests and the hiking is really kind of boring. I've put in my headphones already for much of the trail and I didn't expect to do that so soon.We came upon Hawk Mountain campsite but it looked like nothing much, so we continued three fourths of a mile to the shelter. I knew the wind was going to be bad again so I grabbed a spot in the upper deck of the shelter which was extremely protected. It was a good spot, with just me and Grey Eagle up there. Jurgen was there and he gave me back my guidebook. I felt kind of bad that I just had him carry extra weight all day, but I keep telling him it's still his.I called Katie this afternoon and talked through my upcoming plans. I'm still planning to leave the trail. I'm not enjoying it nearly as much as I thought I would -- I like listening to podcasts and chatting with people at shelters and reading my book in my sleeping bag, but that's maybe 10% of my day. To make it to Maine, you have to be a hiker first and a camper second. Leaving the trail can't cross your mind until much, much further into the trail, and I've thought about it most of every day. There are a lot of section hikers and spring break families at the shelter (including a family who lived in SW Missouri for awhile) and their mindset and goals just seem closer to me. I think I need to day trip or single overnight just the sections I want to see.Anyway, this is getting long. Thank you to all who have posted on my guest book so far, I truly appreciate the support. I'm a thru hiker until I'm not, so... onward.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557375,"The nights of not sleeping well and not being sure I even slept continue. The top bunk of the shelter was, as I expected, well protected from the wind. I slept in my Under Armour ColdGear and my fleece and was warm enough until close to morning, when I wrapped a Buff around my neck and pulled a beanie down over my eyes and ears. I'm a side sleeper but both of my hips were really sore and hurt to sleep on them. My back was okay to lay on but I couldn't fall asleep that way, so I just kind of rotisseried myself throughout the evening.Morning eventually came and I took my time packing up. It was extremely cold, so I had to put on my puffy and gloves just to make coffee and eat my poptart. Jurgen took off early, and I didn't see him the rest of the day. Dan left just a bit ahead of me.I was really hopeful that the first climb up out of the campsite after Hightower Gap was Sassafras Mountain, since that was looming large in my guidebook and, dare I say it, the climb was actually easy. Turns out, that was just some little ups and downs and Sassafras was hiding behind. It was tough but not too bad, 700 feet up in about a mile and a half but it had a few switchbacks and was mostly gradual. Near the summit I found Dan and a couple guys from Indianapolis sitting on a big log, so I took the opportunity to sit down, write yesterday's journal, and grab a snack. (We were all eating and three more women joined us shortly after so we dubbed it the Sassafras Food Court.) After a half hour or so, I finished up the summit and then came slowly back down the same grade on the other side.Justus Mountain, right behind it, was less forgiving. Justus Mountain hates you. Justus Mountain stole your girlfriend and kicked your dog. It's shorter than Sassafras, only a 300 foot climb, but it goes straight up in less than half a mile. It gives you a false sense of relief halfway up, switchbacking once then lol jk get back to vertical homeboy.The other side of Justus drops just as sharply but then mostly levels off to a gradual decent into Justus Creek and a bit more pine forest. It was longer trail than I thought (I apparently don't look at my guidebook closely enough) but I eventually came to the creek and topped off my water since it was six miles since the previous source, way back at the shelter. I took my shoes off and let my toes air out since I forgot to at the food court. I only have one hot spot on my left big toe, which I caught yesterday before it turned to a full on blister, and it thankfully didn't get worse today.Another quick mile and a half with The History of Howard Stern in my headphones and I was at Gooch Mountain Shelter. I was hoping to set up my tent since it's still packed up wet from Springer, but most of the tent sites were taken and the ones left were all slightly angled. The top bunk of the shelter was open, and since it was worth it last night, I took it again. (There are now four of us up here: me, two of the girls on spring break with their mom who were also at Hawk last night, and a section hiker named Thor who came all the way from Springer this morning and is doing huge miles.)I'm now at the shelter, my water bottles and belly full. There are more people here in general tonight than at Hawk last night -- the ridge runner here seems to be getting nervous that we're filling up.The plan tomorrow is to enjoy a slow morning and then get to Woody Gap, less than five miles away, by 5:30 so I can catch the Hiker Hostel shuttle. I'll stay there tomorrow night and then get a flight home on Saturday.So, yes, I'm still leaving the trail. I've had a lot of time to think through it while walking, and I'm going to write a full post about it when I get home and have time to collect my thoughts. For now, I'm very appreciative to have had this opportunity and to have met so many great people along the way. Dan and Jurgen, if you're reading this, I look forward to seeing your Katahdin pictures.More tomorrow.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557465,"I'm not sure if I slept last night or not (sensing a pattern?) as we had a shelter snorer, though I got differing reports on who it actually was. My ibuprofen wore off in the middle of the night too, so my IT band went back to hurting.I took it slow this morning since I only had less than five miles to go to Woody Gap, where the Hiker Hostel picks up at 5:00. Thor, my bunkmate, was up and out early and so I ""woke up"" when he did but took my time getting out of my warm sleeping bag. As people started coming into the shelter for breakfast, I hopped down and made my Mountain House biscuits and gravy that Katie had gotten me (review: excellent, and when they say two servings, they mean it). I'd heard there was a full trail magic breakfast at Gooch Gap, about a mile and a half up the trail, but I didn't want to get there early enough to partake since that would've put me to my destination way too early. So I stuck around the shelter and dried my tent out from Tuesday night's storm. I also passed off some food to hikers leaving. I still didn't have a good sense of my pace vs terrain, and I didn't want to end up late, so I took off about ten.The trail magic was still happening when I passed through, and I caught up with a lot of people who had left earlier. I was offered an apple but said no thanks as I was still full from the morning.The trail was mostly easy today with no huge ups and downs like previous days. For one part of at least a mile, it ran along the side of a mountain instead of up and over. But the trail was real thin and dropped sharply off the right side quite a ways down. Made me a bit nervous at times.Since the trail was easy, I ended up at Woody Gap at 12:45, over four hours early. I ran into Dan there, took his trash, and said goodbye as he headed off. I'd also said goodbye to Rob, who had stopped at the same place as me every night since Springer, right before the gap but I accidentally called him Tom (another guy who has camped with us each night and was in the shelter with me at Hawk) since they kinda look the same. I realized it like thirty steps down the trail, so when he came through the gap I made sure to apologize loudly :-D There was more trail magic at Woody, so I was able to say goodbye to the two guys from Indianapolis, the spring breaking family from last night, and Paige and Melanie, two friends who I'd been leapfrogging since Sassafras. (By friends I mean they came out together, not that I knew them before.)I found a picnic table out of the cold breeze and killed time by finishing my book and the Howard Stern episode I'd been listening to since yesterday. Two guys showed up during that time and I overheard something about a shuttle, but that it cost money. I didn't pay too much attention until it showed up at 2:30 and turned out to be a Hiker Hostel shuttle. It did cost, but three of us split it, so for less than five bucks I didn't have to sit around the gap another two and a half hours.So I'm back at the hostel, showered and doing laundry. I'll hang out here the rest of the night, maybe go on the Walmart run for dinner, though I still have ramen. I have a flight booked home for tomorrow night. I probably won't journal about tomorrow (it's basically hostel, shuttle, train, airport, flight, my bed) but I will write one final entry sometime early next week. It'll be a long one, explaining my decision to leave the trail and other various thru-hike thoughts I've had over the past few days.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Tiger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557774,"My friend Josh and I play a game every now and then. We don't have a name for it, nor we do we specifically bring it up, but it happens fairly often. It's a thought experiment exercise, where one of us will bring up a question, perhaps a morally ambiguous one, or one where it's relatively easy to make arguments for both sides. We'll talk through it, explore the implications, take the various paths to their logical conclusions. I enjoy it, because I often come out of it with a different answer to the question than how I thought I'd answer it right off the bat.As you can imagine, I've been playing the solitaire version of that game quite a lot for the past week.My question: What happens when your dream is no longer your dream?Follow-up questions: How much is needed to be certain that your dream is no longer your dream? And how do you make peace with the decision to leave your dream behind?This adventure only became a spoken reality a year ago. I'd been preparing for it, though, even just in my head, for a good three years. I'd meticulously researched every gear option, right down to the best tool for digging a cathole. I'd read nearly every AT book I could get through interlibrary loan. I kept (and still keep) a text document of Trailjournals that I read and update every day. My confidence was through the roof. I talked a huge game, telling everyone that broken bones would be the only way I'd get off trail. I don't think my confidence was misplaced, but underlying it was a critical assumption that I'd left unchallenged because it was such a foundational principle: the assumption that I'd actually enjoy it.And that, in a word, is why I left the trail. I didn't enjoy the hiking. The community was wonderful; I had a ton of fun meeting other hikers, hanging out at the shelter chatting over dinner, seeing people show up unexpectedly on summits or other spots on the trail. I liked curling up in my sleeping bag with my book. I liked working through my backlog of podcasts. But I thought I'd be completely overwhelmed with the hiking itself, bounding up and down mountains jet-powered on sheer joy. I thought the sights and sounds of nature would pick me up and float me across the landscape in a blur of exhilaration. Instead, I was... bored. So, so bored. From the moment I left the shelter in the morning to pulling into the next one at night, I had no enjoyment for what I was doing. I spoke to one hiker, Justin, when I was back at the Hiker Hostel after a pick-up at Woody Gap and he was describing the ""euphoria"" he felt out on the trail, almost laughing and crying while summiting mountains, in disbelief that he was actually out there. Many other hikers expressed similar feelings. I never felt that.I'd read blogs in the months and years before I left, and most of them would say something like ""I flew up and over these two mountains"" and then spend a couple paragraphs or more on the people and the evening experience. In words written vs. time spent, the ratio is completely flipped. The parts I enjoyed, the non-hiking parts, were maybe 15% of my day and that was going to drop sharply the further I walked. I don't blame people for writing that way, not even a little bit (and don't get the impression that that's exclusive); I blame myself for not reading further into things, for not recognizing what I was getting into. I even wrote in a journal entry a few months back that the AT is a mental challenge. That's absolutely true, so much more true than I realized, but I never took the time to examine what was truly meant by that. I just figured I'd need mental fortitude to power myself over a steep stretch of trail, or the wherewithal to be okay being away from family and friends for a while. I didn't understand that I'd need the toughness to block myself from boredom. To slow my head wayyyy down and be okay with the hours and hours daily of sameness and slog. I hadn't understood my psychological need to keep my brain engaged and running all day and I tried to drop myself into an environment that I didn't realize provided starkly limited stimuli for such engagement. (If it sounds absolutely crazy to you that the trail isn't a constant barrage of visual and auditory wonderment, you're exactly where I was at before the trail.)And I'd be lying if I said that cost didn't also play a factor. Being the accountant/financial type that I am, I of course ran through the cost-benefit calculations before committing to the hike. Like an algebra problem, multiple variables existed, and I filled them in, but they were based on assumption and expectation. Once I got on the trail and set the variables to their true values, the calculations radically changed. The cost to enjoyment ratio became much too great. For something I was doing voluntarily, at a rather significant cost to me, it was increasingly difficult to justify the worth. (Update:
Josh points out that this is a textbook example of Bayesian inference and suggests I reference it as such. I am happy to oblige.)But don't get me wrong; I do not regret a single thing about the experience. I had to go out there to see what it was, to find out that it wasn't for me, and I'm super glad that I had the opportunity to do so. Very few people even take the step to get to Springer Mountain. I learned a lot about myself in the process. For instance, I have even less doubt that, physically, I could have thru-hiked. I know that I can carry 32.5 pounds for 30 miles up and over mountains four times the size of anything here in Missouri. I know that I still like backpacking, I just don't like solo thru-hiking, which is a miniscule part of the backpacking universe. I keep a full page list of goals on my computer and I have a new sense of clarity on some of them. I have a better appreciation for all the big and little things I enjoy, and an intensified drive to focus on them. I have plans to take a huge international trip this summer that otherwise wouldn't have happened. I will go on family vacations, visit new restaurants, plan new adventures. I am happy.Onward,Drew",,Day #N/A,"Mar 27, Mon",0
