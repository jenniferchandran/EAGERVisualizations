Campbell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581862,"Christmas Day I was anxious for our planned 4 day hike in NJ., Knowing we had to face the very cold temps. But also thankful knowing we had scheduled shuttles to and from the Motel each day. Every day started in the single digits
Day 1 
Our hike began with a fairly fresh snowfall of about 2 inches and reached up to 3 or 4 inches the further North we hiked. We had an enjoyable first day. It was quite cold but sunny and our spirits were up. Fascinated with spotting a few bear tracks along the way. Stopping briefly at Sunrise Mtn. With a very large pavilion and great view. 
At the end of the day we came up with a list of things we needed and headed to Walmart. Found mostly what we needed but Walmart didn’t have the face covering I was looking for to keep my face warm, so I settled for buying a cheap fleece blanket cutting it into thirds. Creating 3 scarves for us girls. Perfect ! HA !

To start the day off right we stopped at an awesome place for breakfast near our Motel. Belgian waffles loaded with fresh strawberries and walnuts, along with bacon & coffee. Perfect start to energize myself for the day which lay ahead.
Today was our longest day planned and it was colder than yesterday. Very thankful for our creative scarves with a tie die design, HA ! We began at 9:00 sharp with our Trusty Shuttle Guy George. After 2 1/2 hours of hiking we were happy to see that the High Point State Park Building was open. So we stopped in to warm up, potty break and the woman inside working there offered us all a hot coffee !! We were elated and decided to take an early lunch and eat inside. We knew that would be our only warm spot for the day and a more comfortable time eating lunch. 
Back out into the Cold , we pressed on. Not passing a soul the first two days on the trail. We enjoyed the view of the High Point Monument, although we did not hike up to it. Extra mileage and frigid air , we opted out. We signed in to a shelter & took a break and enjoyed reading others comments logged in. 
Today was a physically tough day, I think because of adjusting to the cold. But we did plenty of sweating and cooling down. I felt like my body didn’t know wether to be hot or cold. As soon as you stopped you chilled down quick. 
At the end of our hike we were too exhausted to go out to dinner , so we ordered Pizza delivery. Perfect !!! It was awesome , along with a HOT shower and wine to boot :) ...
We even offered back rubs and foot rubs to each other :)... Great End to an exhausting fullfilling day.

Today as another longer day planned and we set out to hike close to 13 miles. Another COLD day and actually the coldest day of all 4 days hiked. Started with single digits and wind. Throughout the hike this day we had a fair amount of flat terrain and even some road walking. Walked around the Mascatuck National Wildlife Refuge. 
Soon realizing that my feet were really becoming painful. Bruised feeling toes and possible Blisters on my heels. I needed to stop and apply Moleskin to my heels. And try to re tie my boots so my foot wouldn’t move in my boot so much. Thankful for friends to help me out. Not fun taking off your socks in the insanely COLD temps !! 
We stopped at a shelter to eat lunch and dreamed of drinking hot chocolate. That was short lived because our stove wouldn’t light. I was sooo thankful that I did have hot soup in my thermos.!! My friends had cold sandwiches. Today I was anxious to finish the days hike. My feet hurt but I continued to stay positive and press on. Despite the cold, it was beautiful and I was grateful to be part of this 4 day hike.
We came to a cool boardwalk on this day , stretching about 1 1/2 miles or so. It was raised about 5 feet off the ground winding through lots of cat tails and tall grasses. It looked similar to the Wildlife Refuge we walked around earlier. Also,  Noticing the trails through NJ were much more swampy in places and many boarded areas to keep from stepping in the muck. Most of them were close to the ground.Just enough to keep you dry. Don’t slip or that would be a total bummer !! 
Nearing the end of our day hike , we were beat and about 1 mile to finish at Rt. 94 when my friend realized she must have dropped her phone... it was gone. NOOOO !!! We back tracked maybe a half mile or more But my friend FOUND it !! thank God !! Still on schedule finishing at Rt. 94

Our last day started with a hard climb and we were ready ! All fueled up and ready to climb the Stairway to Heaven . Wow, That was harder than we expected. Basically climbing over large boulders and large rock steps of all different sizes. Really having to lift your leg high for each step. It was about a 1.4 mile climb.We were told over 300 rocks were placed years ago to make it easier to climb. I cant imagine what it was like before that ! Oh, and we did use Yak Trax each day. Much safer ! We were elated to have reached the summit of the Stairway to Heaven and Outlook ( The View ) by 9:30am.  Got a great view of where we had been the last several days. 
We had 10 miles to hike today and were happy to have gotten the hardest part out of the way ! So it seemed. The rest of our hike consisted of ALL UPS & DOWNS... Not sure we had a level spot all day. It was taking a toll on our hips, knees and feet. BUT, We prevailed and hit our goal of reaching the NJ/NY Border !! 
One last note of thanks to our Shuttlers George and Ken !! They were both very knowledgeable and Kind. Worth the extra $$ to do less driving ourselves around after a long hard day. Also , very impressed with the Appalachian Motel in Vernon , NJ. Very clean rooms and new bathrooms made with tile and glass doors. Pleasantly surprised for a MOTEL :) !!!
Time to plan my next section hike !!!
