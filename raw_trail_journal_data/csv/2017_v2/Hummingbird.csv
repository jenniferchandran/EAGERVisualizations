Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/417245,"Dear Journal, 
It's been a long while now since the thought was put into my head to hike that long trail from Georgia to Maine. My friend Tom mentioned it and would tell me about a group who are planning to begin the hike in April of 2014. They would all be over sixty years old. I thought it was intriguing, but not something that I could do. I would be sixty by then. hmmm..
It's funny how something will stick in your head and come to mind from time to time. Actually, this thought has been coming up much more often than from time to time. I began to read books and look up the Appalachian Trail online to find pages and pages of information sites. The desire and fire to hike this trail has set in deep!
Why am I going to hike this Appalachian Trail?
Because I want to do something awesome for myself. Because I will be sixty years old and still able to do it! Because I hope that the beauty of the mountains will bring me closer to nature and to God. That I will better understand and appreciate my life I have lived so far and what life has yet to show me. 
I'm going to hike the AT and I am going to be the one in four who makes it all the way from Georgia to Maine!",,Why I want to hike the Appalachian Trail ?,"May 29, Wed",0
Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/417292,"Good Morning Journal,This is a mystery question!   Ha.   All through the years there have been various miles quoted. With our GPS technology now, we should have an exact distance. With changes made in the trail since its creation, the distance has changed with it.   Here is what I have found in my research.2,015 miles from ""The Appalachian Trail"" by Ronald Fisher 19722,155 miles from ""There are Mountains to Climb"" by Jean Deeds 19962167.9 miles from ""Blind Courage"" by Bill Irwin with David McCasland 19922179.1 miles from ""The AT Guide"" by David""Awol"" Miller 2013 editionHave you noticed it gets longer with time?

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/417982,"Wow.. How quickly the time passes when there is so much to do.   I worry a little that I can't be ready for next April. Then I tell myself that's foolish. There is plenty of time to be ready as long as I stay focused.   I'm enjoying reading the journals from those who are preparing to hike and those who are currently hiking. I can ""feel"" the trail through their words. I'm learning from you what to expect and what I will need to do to prepare for my own thru-hike.   Thank you for the time you share here.",,June 1st..,"Jun 01, Sat",0
Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/418688,"Hi.. I'm still learning how to use this journal and find that I sometimes lose the entry before I post it. How strange is that. I have to start all over. Then I wonder if there will be a group of half finished entries showing up.. Ha.
I had a good hike on the 5th of June. It was a beautiful day and I really love being up in the canyon enjoying the view and the solitude. The picture I'm including is half way to the top of the canyon. 
Wish I could spend more time out there but life requires food and food requires money and money requires work.",,Everyday brings us closer... ,"Jun 06, Thu",0
Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/422422,"Hello all you hikers...I haven't been doing well at keeping up with my journal. I still have time to make it a habit before I hit the trail in April. It seems so far away and yet when I realize how quickly these past three months have passed, I feel I better get myself on track. Couldn't figure out why my journal entries so far haven't shown up and hopefully have that solved. Obviously, if you are reading this I have figured it out. Ha.It's been a busy month. I have enjoyed reading the journal entries everyday even if I haven't been inclined to write my own. There is an amazing group of people here and I look forward to meeting some of you next year. Thanks to all of you who are hiking right now. Your information is invaluable to my preparation. It is helping me choose the right things I will need for the hike and eliminate those things I thought I should take. Going light is certainly important to enjoy the hike to the maximum. I am not planning a ""race"" to the finish but I certainly do want to finish! I hope you all had a great June.. Father's Day and the arrival of ""Summer"".

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/422472,"Good Morning.. It's a beautiful day in Santa Monica..Easy day today. I have two dogs to walk (I'm a dog walker..) and the rest of the day is mine to get out and hike.. I'm looking forward to that! I hike the Temescal canyon trail .. several times.. It's a 3 mile loop that elevates one thousand feet. By using this trail I can keep track of my distance and experience the climb and decent. So far I have made four continuous rounds before the sun set. Most of the time, I can squeeze in two rounds a few times a week. I need a full day to reach my current goal of 20 miles or more. I'm feeling fit. Also working on my cardio strength with morning workouts. Fast paced walking on the beach in the sand is another option I have that I don't do often enough. I need to measure the distance between the Santa Monica pier and the Venice pier to set my goals. Now I do one round and feel it! Ha..Bicycle riding is another activity that helps me prepare for the hike. Rick and I get out on the bikes once a week if possible. We ride twenty to thirty miles along the beach. There are a few inclines but it's mostly for pleasure of sharing outside time together and enjoying the view of the ocean and beaches. I've begun to enter my gear into the Journal. This is great! Have a wonderful day!",,Setting up Gear entries..,"Jun 27, Thu",0
Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423520,"Here we are into July now. Time is just moving right along. The excitement is growing as well. 
Thanks to all who have left me notes and share emails. It's nice to meet you and share your thoughts on the hike as well as get to know who you are. The hiking ""family"" extends beyond the trail both before, during and after the hike. 
Tomorrow will be a busy celebration day. I had a head start with Santa Monica celebrating with fireworks last Thursday. They always fire them off a week ahead. ??? So I get to enjoy them twice. Here and again in Tujunga where my guy Rick lives. 
Yesterday I went hiking in the canyon. I will add a couple of photos to my collection. It always is nice to get out there and away from the hustle and bustle of my daily life. Traffic in California is horrible and I find that raises my ""stress level"" the most! What a relief it will be to get away from it while I'm on the trail. 
Tried out my sleeping bag again last night. I'm not used to a mummy bag and find it a bit confining. I found myself on top of it in the morning.. ha. What is that saying? Practice makes perfect! I do need to practice setting up my tent. It's supposed to only take 3 minutes when you know how to do it. 
Have a wonderful holiday. Eat lots of hotdogs and hamburgers.. potato and macaroni salad.. watermelon.. and all those foods you associate with it!",,Welcome July!,"Jul 03, Wed",0
Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/424696,"My friend Ann sent me a ""mountain"" song and it gave me the idea of adding songs here for those of you on the trail now and for those of us who will soon be there this coming year.   I'm printing off the lyrics to take with me on the hike when I find myself alone. It's not unusual to hear me singing on my little hikes now when there is no one else around.. ha. Today I send this one especially to those on the trail who all have had to deal with that tremendous amount of rain we have had this year.. enjoy!   I'm going back in to read more entries from you wonderful people.

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/425762,"Time is marching on and it won't be long before the six month countdown begins. I have set the six months before I hike to be my ""pressure"" time frame. Pressure to get out and hike every chance I can. Hopefully some overnights included. Pressure to say ""No"" to those things that constantly come up to distract me from this plan. Pressure in putting everything in order so I have no ""worries"" about coming back when I finish. The journal entries keep me focused and I do thank everyone who is sharing their present hike with us and those who are preparing as I am. Along with the journals, I am reading all the books I can find on hiking as I look for ways to make my hike the best it can be. I ordered the "" Appalachian Trail Thru-Hike Planner"" through Amazon and it's on it's way. With all the new gear and books, it feels like Christmas in July! I'm off to walk the dogs and then have the afternoon to go on a beach walk. Walking in the sand really helps with the cardio workout! Good for the feet too!",,Moving along..,"Jul 16, Tue",0
Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/428487,"Hello.   Another month closer.. Yes!   Seven more to go.. I read Brian Beaton's entry on his first preparation camp night. It made me smile and laugh out loud.   I will begin my ""practice"" nights before too long. Right now I am in the moving mode. Gave my notice to my landlord and began the shifting of my ""stuff"" to Rick's house. We have our marriage license and now are working out the wedding details with our schedules and the minister. It will be a private, intimate affair.. If you aren't reading Sisu's entries, you really should be. His writing is wonderful and makes me wonder if he writes articles for publications. The latest one is on electronics to take on the trail. I will have my smartphone and camera but no other gadgets. I'm not a ""purist"" but I do want this hike to be a connection with Nature. Since I don't ""plug"" my ears into music now, I don't see a reason to do it then. Don't get me wrong. I do like music and I'm sure I will be humming as I hike.. After all ""Hummingbird"" is my trail name. Ha. I've been checking out the Southwest Airline schedule watching for the first opportunity to book my flight on March 30th. Right now they are up to March 7th scheduling. I check it every few days.If I can get to Amicalola Falls the day I arrive, I will begin to hike the Approach trail in the morning and leave from Springer Mountain on the 1st of April. That would be nice if it works out this way. I will check out my options to get from Atlanta to the Approach Trail when I have my plane ticket. Hopefully, ""Survivor Dave's Trail Shuttle"" will work with my arrival. There are other services if it doesn't. I hope you have a good month and make time for hiking.. All is well..",,Welcome August,"Aug 03, Sat",0
Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/428923,"Good Morning.. my best time for journal entries..It's a beautiful day out and I have plans to hike in the canyon this afternoon. First I must go walk some dogs and pack up a few more things for my move. Nice and easy and will be finished before I know it.Making plans for my birthday on the 14th.. The big 60!! I'm still trying to convince myself that I am really THAT old! Ha. What happened? ha   Rick and I will go hike and camp for a couple of days. A good way to celebrate! A good time to test out my tent and equipment to be sure I know how to use it comfortably. I'm sure it will become second nature on the trail. My gear collection is coming near the end if we ever can get to the end of remembering one more thing. I haven't gone over the 20 lbs yet but feel some concern with the water and food weight. Do we count that in the 20 lbs or is that only for the base weight of gear and clothes? Here I go trying to justify a few more lbs. ha. I really don't want to have to ""dump"" anything on the trail. I'm not planning on mailing any boxes to myself. If I find I do need anything, it can be purchased along the way. I do expect to replace my boots since the average boot lasts about 500 miles. Is that true? I will find out!My current decision is whether to bring a stove or eat cold food on the trail and hot food off the trail... with ice cream for dessert of course! That seems to be the hiker's favorite treat! Today's entries I read were from Canary and Bandit who are on the trail now. I didn't give much thought about what happens when a dog gets sick on the trail. Poor little guy! I'm happy that he is doing alright now.I'm always happy to see more people planning to start next year. Welcome to Michael Palmer. It must be more difficult for the Florida flat land people to prepare for mountain hiking. He seems determined and fit enough to do it! Off into my day now.

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/429623,"Hi.It was exciting to read about ""Groundpounder"" making it to the top! Congratulations Matthew Chabot on a hike well done! I am planning on accomplishing that myself next year. I'm anxious, excited and concerned at the same time..After reading M.J. Kirby's (Traveling Eagle 2014) entry about his mother going into Hospice, I realized that life at home will not be on ""hold"" while we hike for five or six months. That could be a concern for sure. We can only hope that everyone stays healthy and that we would not have to leave the trail for urgent family matters. August has turned out to be extremely ""full"" for me. I turn 60 on the 14th.. I leave one job on the 26th.. begin passing off the dogs I walk on the 27th.. leave my apartment on the 28th.. and get married to Rick on the 31st.!!! Wedding plans are ""sweet and simple"" ..Packing and unpacking between houses is getting done ""slow but sure""..September will begin my heavy duty training for the hike. Six months to gain the physical confidence for this challenge. I can only guess what it will be like from what I read from others on the trail. Thank you all for your ""sneak preview"".. Ha.

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/430922,"Hello..I'll be leaving my apartment in another week. Not much left here to pack up and I'm feeling good. It's not easy now finding the things I need as everything is in bags or boxes. I read Molasses & Mac&Cheese entries. Tom and Scott.. Father and Son..   That's good to see family members hiking together. Will you love each other more or hate to be together by the end of this hike? I'm teasing.. The entries did make me think about zero days off and how I will handle them. Will I dread getting back on the trail after having even basic luxury again? I hope not. I don't think I will. There has to be a greater appreciation of those things we take for granted.I also read Hey Man, Mary Manley's first entries. Welcome Mary. You have a good sense of humor and I look forward to reading your entries as you too prepare for the hike in 2014. I won't be leaving as early as she is and may not catch up with her on the trail. I'll be sure to follow her along in the journal.Well, I turned 60 on the 14th. I didn't feel any different than I did the day before. It was a wonderful birthday that I celebrated all week long.   My next birthday celebration will be on the trail. I'm planning on celebrating it with my sister in Dalton, MA. If all the plans work out right, I should be there by then. Plan to get out to hike this afternoon for a few hours at least. It's been very overcast here these past few days and the air feels heavy with the humidity. It didn't rain as expected yesterday and would be wonderful if the clouds would let go an let it pour down. We sure could use the rain.I'm sharing the sadness of missing Gerry Largay.   I follow the investigation on WhiteBlaze and haven't seen an update since the 14th. According to a news report www.newschannel5.com/story/23133537/family-of-missing-tennessee-hiker-leaves-maine , her husband and daughter have returned to Tennessee and are planning a memorial service for Gerry in October.All of you hiking out there right now, be careful... be safe!Ellie",,Getting closer to September,"Aug 20, Tue",0
Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/433828,"Hello.   August was my month of changes in my year of changes. September brings in the beauty of Autumn!  Rick and I were married on the 31st of August. A special day to celebrate a special change in our lives. I am now Mrs. Frederick Baughman. We are blending our lives and lifestyles without difficulty. All is well!It's been very hot here in Tujunga, CA these past couple of weeks until yesterday when we were able to go take out walk/hike with a cooler breeze. Rick is my coach and inspiration that gets me up and going with exercises and then into our hike. It's much more fun than doing this by myself. I can already feel my ""core"" getting stronger. By the end of March, I should be more than ready to hike the Appalachian Trail. Reading Flatfoot's latest journal entry, I was taken back to New Hampshire where I once lived. I remember how tough it is to climb the mountains there and how good it will be to have them at the end of the hike rather than the beginning. I suppose there could be an argument made there but for me that would be my preference. I also read Tabitha Hubbard's entry for hiking 2014. It's not any different for me in having family concerns over hiking the trail. You are young and I am old.. HA.   My family is for me hiking the trail but there is that worry that something ""bad"" could happen. Especially after Inchworm went missing. I feel secure in that it is the most hiked trail in the world. There is also our technology that we can communicate with family quite easily and often. I won't begin until April, so I will look for your entries as you hike ahead of me. An inspiration to follow! Good luck to you! and me! ha.

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/436992,"Hi.. Don't you just hate it when your journal entry disappears?   Will it show up again at a later date? Here I go again.. All is well here in California. The weather has been cool if not cold in the mornings making it a wonderful time to hike the canyons. After an hour of exercising, Rick and I go out for another couple of hours or longer hiking. Some days it's more difficult climbing and other days the hours just breeze by. I wonder what the continuous hiking day after day will be like? I expect the aches and pains and wonder how many days will be pain free if any. I'm enjoying reading the journals and appreciate hearing from the hikers who have responded to my Guest Book entries into their journals. So many different experiences they share but all are connected by the trail. I wonder how I will handle the rain and how often I will feel the need to get off for zero days. Since I am not starting until April 1st.. after I hike up the Approach Trail March 31st. I will need to keep aware of the time schedule to make it to Maine before they close Katahdin. If I am correct it's mid October. My gear is almost all set. I am at the place in my preparation that I am trading out things.. adding things .. eliminating things.. I'm sure it will be unending until I finally reach the day when it's time to leave. I do need my ground cloth (footprint) and sleeping bag liner.   I'll get some Tyvek at Home Depot and maybe make my bag liner myself. Halloween will be here before we know it!

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/437702,"Happy Halloween and a good start to the holiday season!I just read Sidewinders journal entries and it made me realize that there are many things that can take us off the trail. I had been thinking of those things that might happen to me, not to my family members. Our hikes involve more than our walk in the woods. As I was reading journals and all the various hiking sites that come up as I search the internet, I found ""Hiking for Mental Health"". It's a wonderful site to check out. Hikers can set up their own little sponsor site and help raise money for mental health awareness as well as helping out hiking trails. They give a percentage of the donations to trail maintenance. You can check them out and maybe add yourself on the site. It's getting cooler here and making our morning hikes more pleasurable. I discovered that I am a cool weather person. Heat makes my hike much more difficult. Though I haven't hiked more than eight miles or so at one time, I find that I am getting much stronger everyday. November, Rick and I begin hiking with the backpacks. He is coming around to the idea of hiking the trail with me.. at least part of it and enjoying the preparation. I'll need to figure out places along the trail that would be the best for family and friends to join me. They will be flying in from California. I'd hate for them to have a difficult time getting to me.    I'm using the suggested average 12 mile a day schedule from the AT Guide book so they can know where I will be along my way. It will be tricky with zero days and those days when I can possibly hike more than the planned miles. A juggling of sorts.   Any suggestions? We have our Jack-O-Lanterns carved.. We have our candy ready to hand out trying not to eat it up before Thursday. ha. I hope you all have a time of fun and lots of good treats!  Ellie",,Happy Halloween,"Oct 28, Mon",0

I hope all who hiked the trail last year have fallen back into the ""routine"" and have time to keep in touch with those of us who are hiking this year.

Or maybe I have to remove a few things. Gotta keep that gear weight down. It will difficult leaving Rick on March 31st. He and my two children have plans to visit me at different times to keep me company. I am looking through the journals to see where family has joined you on the trail and how they got there. Since we live across the country, it will involve getting them from the airports to the meeting points and back to the airport after they have hiked a few days with me. Of course the cellphone will be a wonderful connection. I have a battery backup that should give me the power I need between recharges to keep up my journal and emails. I bought the LG4 that is supposed to have the longest battery life. I just wonder about the AT@T connection on the trail. Time to put a photo on my site. I'll be getting my hair cut off tomorrow.

I will enjoy keeping in touch to see what you are up to. I appreciate all your advice and will take heed of it. My concern now is how to achieve the best physical state that I can in these final preparation days. The regular exercise workout in the mornings show me where the aches and pains are and what to work on. The almost daily hiking and walking here in the canyons ensures me that this can be done! On the days we have to ""skip"" the hike, I find my mood is greatly affected. I need that boost that fresh air and beautiful outside views give to me.   Now to wear the backpack weight at least three days a week. I don't feel the need to wear it daily for three extra months.

Having read Monster Cheese's review entry of his hike last year, I feel even more prepared to face what will come. He created a wonderful review to share with us preparing for the hike. Ironically, he mentions his boots.. the same brand that I wear.. and pleased me to see that he got over 700 miles out of them. Soaring Eagle's post brought an awareness that we are all vulnerable to accidents.. especially falls. He smacked his head hard on a rock. Ouch! We must be aware of what is around us and where we are walking. Fortunately, he is recovering well. Morgen talks about goals and what he hopes to get from this hike. I can see from all our entries, all the different aspects of the hike.. Where all our minds travel in preparation as well as in review from those who walked before us. Thank you all.

Very, very helpful. Check out his site if you need to get shuttled. He is chock full of useful information. I'll be staying overnight on the 31st just north of the airport and Dave will be picking me up early in the morning to arrive at Springer and start my hike. April 1st. It's also Dave's Birthday! Wish him a happy birthday! ha.   I had been planning on hiking the approach hike, but after discussing it with Dave and how demanding that approach trail is (604 steps), I agreed that I would rather begin my AT hike with that energy I would have used up getting there. It also would set me back with another day of camping before I would begin. All is good. It gets closer everyday! I'm sure all of you preparing for this year are as excited as I am!

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441220,"Hi.   Time is ticking right along. Now to review my preparation and make adjustments. I am ready.. I know I am but waiting makes me doubt myself. It's very reassuring to hear from others that the trail will make the physical adjustments needed that I haven't already done. The daily "" get up and walk"" will only come from doing it. The mindset is already there. Whitebear and Cujo will be hiking again this year. Good for you! They will be ahead of me and I will be watching how it goes for them. They have hiked the trail before and are an experienced source of information. Jim Finch will be leaving early as well. I'm not sure why people would be willing to deal with colder weather rather than people. I feel that people will filter out through their pace or discovering it's not for them. Thanks Jim for information on your gear. We share the same brand and style of boots. Merrill.. gotta love them! Then there is Midge who is preparing for 2016. You can't start too soon.. There is plenty to read about and time to find the gear you like at sale prices. It amazes me now to read about those who are leaving within a few months and are just beginning to buy their gear. I'm not seeing many who list or mention plastic for a groundcloth under their tent. I decided to get some. Sleep is very important to keep on hiking and a wet tent and bag just wouldn't allow that!

We hadn't given the holiday weekend much thought when we went down to Santa Monica yesterday to ride bicycles on the beach. It was busy there. We still got our ride in and it was beautiful riding along the beach path. I didn't realize how much I missed the ocean. Moving here to the canyon last August, I am now seeing the changes in the canyon and how the shadows move during the day bringing a wide variety of colors. Purple mountain majesty! It makes me wonder how I will adjust to the AT. Will the mountains take my breath away immediately or will it grow more or less beautiful as I hike?My journal readings today included two hikers who were reminiscing about their 2013 hikes. Chin Music showed his AT map on the wall with the pins. It made me smile because I have the same map on my wall. Rick mounted and hung it up so he can follow me along. I bought three more for my two children to follow as well and my sister in Massachusetts who will be seeing me at the end of the hike. I enjoyed reading how he fell back into his home life four months later. It's a heartwarming entry.Rosy Eagle also hiked in 2013 and shares his last day after completing the hike. Catching up with people he met along the trail as well as those who were just behind him and congratulating each other. I can feel the happiness of finishing as well as the realization that it was really over. I want to share those feelings with people in this 2014 group! Sterett who will be leaving early March made me laugh with his ""trial"" hike. He learned the importance of a ""light"" pack after beginning with 42 lbs. It made me wonder if he had read any of the journal entries here on the site. That was one of the first things I learned from the wonderful advice we get here. Checking out gear lists is a favorite pastime of mine now. Ha.Now it's time to get on with my daily routine. I'm a routine type of person. I wonder what routine other than the obvious hiking, I will develop along the way. Living by the sunrise and sunset for sure. Setting up my campsite and packing it up in the morning. Stopping to rest and getting off the trail to resupply. Will it all become routine or will everyday be an adventure? How cold and how hot will it get?

I feel so fortunate to be able to take our morning hike in this beautiful California weather. Yes, I'm rubbing it in.. ha.

I'm very glad that he made it through and will be on the AT in April. I hope I get to meet you and tell you how happy I am that you're here. Patriot shares his final thoughts of his hike and it warms my heart that he credits his wife for helping him to make it all the way. I know how important it is to have those supporting us. Being away from my husband Rick and my kids will be tough. They will join me along the way for a short visit and keeping phone and email contact will make me able to bear the hard times. I'll have to read other journals to see where family came in and left from. I'm thinking every 500 miles would be nice for one of them to show up. ha.

I want to have the longest time possible to get through the park. In the meantime, I am reading those entries of people who are out there today and moving right along. The weather has me concerned for them with the wet and cold they are facing. May the sun come out and warm them up! Reading ""Geared up""s entries was interesting. He is using a wax stamp to leave his mark in the shelter journals. I never thought of that.. Could be a good idea. I still would need to ""say"" something though. He also has chosen the ""Hike for Mental Health"" site as a cause for his hike. I joined that awhile ago and will be hiking for people to become more aware of those health issues. I'll also be hiking for Diabetes awareness. Being a type 2 diabetic, as well as my daughter having type 1 diabetes, I am learning the differences between them and what it takes to deal with them. You can expect some ""facts"" on these two illnesses to show up in my journals. I believe there are at least a few diabetics on the trail this year.

Fortunately, Citibank had them and now I am set in that area. I'm still planning on using my credit card where possible. Just make sure you let your bank know that you will be out of your home state. They shut them down if you try to use it out of state without notifying them beforehand.

Preparing my mind!   It's an important part of getting ""ready"". As I have been reading other journal entries, I see that we are not unlike each other in wanting to connect with ""ourselves, nature and God"" as well as taking on the challenge.   There are causes showing up as well. Two causes I would like to take on are ""Awareness"" health issues. I would like to dedicate my hike to my daughter Sharon Beam Leal and my sister Beverly ""B-mile"" Milenski. Both are living with challenging lifelong health issues. Through learning we improve our lives and those of others.Sharon is a Type 1 diabetic. Because she is such a positive person, most people have no idea what she is dealing with. I often forget myself until I hear her monitor beep and she needs to adjust her insulin pump. Being a Type 2 diabetic myself, I have more of an understanding but have learned that the two types of diabetes have great differences. Sharon will be joining me on the trail for part of the Virginia stretch. It requires much more planning for her with insulin requirements and storage.Beverly is Bipolar. There is much to be learned and shared about bipolar disorder. Beverly is giving of herself in promoting awareness on this mental health issue . In fact, this afternoon she and her husband Paul have been asked to speak in front of a local CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) of police officers, on how they have managed living with Bipolar disorder. Beverly has a local television program ""Smile with B-Mile"". One episode was an interview with a bipolar young woman. This episode is considered a great tool in helping policemen to recognize people suffering from bipolar disorder as opposed to being disorderly and dangerous. As I hike these following six months, I want to read about and understand more about these two health issues. I would like to share ""facts"" I learn and also hear from others who want to share what they know. The journal is our place to share our experience on the trail and how we ""feel"".

I can go in and edit it along the way on my cell phone or at a computer if I find myself falling behind or ahead of myself.

Reminded me of Rowen and Martin's Laugh-in where the little old man falls over on his tricycle. Ha! No worries. Carol helped me up. Not a scratch.
Again we had trail magic in the form of apples and tangerines.. How refreshing! Learning that I carry too much water. Cross too many water sources between fill ups. Need to check the guide more often. I'm learning by my mistakes. I sure hope to learn quickly.. Ha.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/447965,"Woke up to a wet bed. My water bottle leaked out into my sleeping bag. Ugh. Another lesson learned. Make sure all bottles lids are screwed down tight. Good thing we made it to Neels Gap hostel. They offer shower's and laundry service. I feel like a new woman. Ha. Got my new pack.
Yes! Though I am tall I'm short waisted. What a difference a well fired pack makes. This one has a light frame that allows me to put it on myself. Won't Carol appreciate that! Ha.
It was a brutal hike today over Blood Mountain. The highest mountain in Georgia. All rock stepping stones both up and down. Just when the hostel was ahead I had to sit down. Three young hikers waited with me to be sure I was OK. Really nice of them. One is leaving the trail with a blown out knee. What a disappointment for him. 
We beat the rain anyway and expect sunshine tomorrow. Now for a good nights sleep.","Lance Creek

I do apologize for lack of entries. It's difficult to do so on the trail with lack of connection and saving my battery.Here to resupply before entering the Great Smokey Mountains. North Carolina has been beautiful and brutal. I thought it was my age but hear young people say the same. My rock climbing skills have improved as well as my slipping and sliding in the mud. Ha. Only one fall with a soft landing. My first hike and camping in the rain was a failure. Hiking not so bad but woke up wet. Luckily the following day was dry and I dried out before too long. The rain has welcomed more delicate wildflowers. A highlight of my hike. Everything is greening up and gives a fresh new day. We are told our miles should increase after all the Puds (pointless ups and downs) and Muds (mindless ups and downs) of NC. Ha. That will be seen. It looks like we may be here another day. Thunderstorms are predicted and hikers are advised to wait. I don't like losing time. My feet won't complain though. Ha. I'm discovering muscles that I never knew I had. I'm getting tough and strong. Easter was a day that I missed home more than normal. There was some wonderful trail magic of apples, bananas, fig newtons and water. Thank you to all who leave us with wonderful treats. Easter evening hiker""Spider"" brought out hotdogs for us to roast. It was a pleasant night and I slept well in my near level tent spot. I'm getting better at finding one. Even the slightest angle makes the sleeping pad slide down all night and I wake up tight to the side of the tent. Every day is a learning day.

Got the last room in town at the Magnolia Inn. Very beautiful and historical. The trail is feeling like home now and I can put in more miles comfortably. There is so much beauty out there it never is boring. New flowers pop up as the hike progresses and the trees are splendid. I'll be leaving after breakfast and make my way as far as evening takes me. It's nice being out of the Smokey National Park where there are more places to stay along the way. I will say the park shelters were well cared for and had privies. Better than most I have seen along the way so far. Looking forward to meeting up with my daughter Sharon in Hampton, TN. For right now there miles to make and places to see. Welcome May..

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456513,"Hi. Here we are at the end of trail days. It was a good experience seeing friends and familiar faces! Everyone having fun playing and learning. Sharon flew in and joined me in Hampton, TN. With her the rain came in along with cold weather. Very disappointing! I had a fallen on wet rocks a few days earlier and the throbbing was increasing as we hiked ten miles. Her pack didn't fit well and her hips were bruised. As we hiked the following day it was clear that we were not having fun. At a road crossing we called in a shuttle to bring us here.About 35 miles before Damascus. We were fortunate that Susie Montgomery took us into her home since we were two days early for our reservation at her rental. Susie has gone out of her way to make us feel welcome and we are so grateful to her. We highly recommended her Montgomery Homestead when you are out this way. My leg is healing. Bruises that won't keep me off the trail. Sharon flies back to California tomorrow and I will return where I left off. I'm so happy she came even if it wasn't quite what the trail usually is. I can go on with new energy from seeing family. Now I only need to find my way back. The shuttles are so busy today I have to wait to see what the schedules are tomorrow. It will be nice getting on my hike again and discover what Virginia has to offer. Celebrate my 400 mile mark with me and my next goal to 500. Be well. May God bless us, Mother Nature give us good weather and the AT give me no more than I can handle.","

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/459123,"Mile 580.7. Here I am spending my day with my foot raised and resting. Having pain on the trail is expected but not pain that holds up the progress of miles walked. Having believed that I was healed, I pushed 20 miles and my ankle said ""No you don't"". I'm spending this zero day washing clothes,reading and talking with family and friends. It's funny how the trail draws people closer together as we sit around the fire and share injury stories and how they are treated and delt with. Today most of the hikers went to Captain's annual hikers feast. They will return tomorrow sometime but I hope to be out on the trail long before they return. I'll take it easy and stop more often for pack breaks. The""Fort Bastion"" camp is a work in process. ""TruBrit"" makes us all feel welcome with $7.00 camp fees, breakfast and a great dinner last night. I recommend stopping by when you pass thru. 
This past month I have moved into VA. There has been more trail magic than I ever imagined. Thank you all who are so giving and generous. I have received water when my bottles were empty. I was cooked dinner and welcomed into families who met me on their day hikes. Unexpected coolers left at road crossings with soda and treats for us hungry and thirsty hikers. Thank you everyone. From children to ex hikers. You make us smile and believe in the goodness of people. God bless you.","

Hummingbird,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461034,"Hi.   This is a sad and difficult entry for me.   My leg injury has taken me off the trail and back to California for a long recovery. I gave it my best try to keep on going but three doctors couldn't be convinced that I could do this without permanent damage. It's been very depressing and emotional to have to leave the AT.I do have to be thankful for having experienced over 600 miles of a wonderful hike. The places I hiked through and the sites I have seen will always be with me. But even more, the people who I met along the way and those unseen people who helped me through ""trail magic"" have given me more than they will ever know. My belief in the kindness of others has been restored. This is the greatest gift I have received from my experience on the Appalachian Trail. People are more important in our lives than what we do and what we have. I will follow those on the trail from home knowing what it ""feels"" like being there. I'm cheering you all on through both the tough and easy times and share your joy of getting a little further each day.   Stay dry, don't run out of water and remember the weight when you resupply!

Rick and I flew up to New England October 1st., rented a car and covered Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts. It was one of the most wonderful vacations. I thought I would be sad since October 1st had been my goal date of completing my hike. We didn't drive up Mt. Washington because of rain. No view to be seen.   But we did enjoy the view from Greylock Mountain in the Berkshires. We did get to view the leaves changing and for a first time visit, Rick was very impressed. Now he understands when I get homesick for New England. My leg is almost like new. A little pain every now and again but it's manageable. After almost six months, I think it's as good as it's going to get. Kettering Strider (Carol) from Ohio, sent me the new book ""Grandma Gatewood's Walk"" by Ben Montgomery.   YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!! She was an amazing woman... more than you may already have thought she was. Carol had to get off the trail after I did and we hope one day to finish the hike.

It has always been the time of year that I like to make plans for the future. I plan to hike the trail again. I have thought of the AT everyday since I had to leave it in June of 2014.   I have to go back and start again. My dream of being a thru hiker will not go away.. ha.I have chosen March 2018 for my start date. This time I will do the Approach Trail. I was sorry that I didn't do it.   I'll have to figure out how to set my journal date again so my entries are reflected in the proper place. I have plenty of time to do that. The reason I am waiting that long is because I will be a grandmother this coming January or maybe the end of December. This is my first grandchild and I do not want to miss out the first two years of their life. So now I will begin my planning.. To use what I learned on those 650 miles I did hike. Trim down the pack.. read all those AT books again.. and connect with those who have begun their 2018 journals. I cheer you on! I cheer all those who have reached Katahdin and those who are almost there! A job well done!,,To begin again... ,"Sep 22, Tue",0
