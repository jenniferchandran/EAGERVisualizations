J-walk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549615,"Early this year when I decided that hiking the AT could be a reality, I wondered if I could physically do the hike. I had sat for the past 8 months at a desk job. My body was tired of sitting long days. I joined a get healthier program offered at work and I decided to go to a physical Therapist to work out some leg muscle problems that were caused from sitting at my job. As my legs began to move and got stronger I went to an exercise specialist to get assessed and to get a Rx for exercise. I told him of my dream to hike the AT and he said ok lets do this. He gave me some exercises to help strengthen my muscles I would be using backpacking/hiking. Along with those exercises and stretches as I have become stronger, I feel like my dream of hiking the AT is a real possibility! I look forward to hitting the trails now that the weather isn't 110 degrees!",,View Entry,"Sep 26, Mon",0

I am nervous and worry that if I buy things and find that I don't like them it will be a waste of money. But I think there is a learning/spending curve to be expected. I've been researching gear and asking questions to hikers that are thru hiking this year and hikers that have hiked in the past. Their info from their experiences have been awesome! (Thank you Storm, Hazel, IWOX, and Trail Dames for answering all my questions!) Also found looking at others Gear list on their Trail Journal has been helpful too. I have a list now of what I think I want to purchase. My biggest question is: Tent or Hammock? In the next couple of weeks I will start making my purchases.

Since March 2016 until now, I've have read a lot about hiking the trail, but wasn't really sure if it's what I should be doing, I have wanted to but wasn't sure. Today I made the decision that I was going to thru hike, and all the confusion about whether I should go or not, melted away and I can now see it happening clearly now. I feel peace in my decision, but yet I'm scared to death about the unknown. I have so much to do. I talked to Kim a friend I will be thru hiking with. We both registered Today at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to start March 22, 2017 from Springer Mountain, the beginning of the Appalachian Trail in Georgia.

As I have told others of my adventure that awaits, it has been enjoyable to see/hear their response to: ""I'm going to take 6 months off work to hike the Appalachian Trail"" = Disbelief, surprise, laughing, astonishment, excitement, worry, concern, Happy and yes Joyful!
I have appreciated all the words of advice from: ""make sure you carry bear spray"" to ""make sure you tuck your pants in your socks to avoid ticks"" & ""carry extra shoes so you can change when your feet are wet"".All the advice, I believe are others ways of helping and wanting to see me succeed at thru hiking the AT!

Cant believe today is the day to start my thru hike if the AT! My Friends husband drove us to Springer Mountain parking lot and as we got out of the car we had our first encounter with ""Trail Angels"" - two trail Ambassadors offered to keep our packs in their car so we could slack pack up to top of springer (which is about 1mile up to the start of the AT) We stowed our packs in their car. I was hoping to be able to slack pack up Springer mountain to the start, it came about-our first Trail Magic!! (Trail Angels are people along the trail that randomly show up and do trail magic- trail magic can be anything that helps the hikers like giving them food, water, or a ride or bandaids etc.) We were given Reese's peanut buttercups- they were a nice pick me up treat along the trail. . We stopped at Stover creek Shelter and ate our lunch and I got my ""Spot all set up to use. We stopped for the night at Three Forks. We stealth camped (that means we camped not at a designated shelter or a camping area.) The falls near by were beautifuland a nice end to the day. We collected water from the creek and filtered it. We set up camp- I had trouble hanging my hammock-not very proficient at it yet! It is comfortable sleeping but a pain to put it and the tarp up. Made dinner a freeze dried beef stew and some mashed potatoes A good day we went farther then we thought we would!

Three Forks to Hawk Mountain Shelter- 
This morning two ladies came by our stealth camp to see the falls. I noticed that one of them had a Spot, one showed me how to get my Spot work. A Spot is a small tracking device that speaks to the satellite - it sends signals and tracks where I am at. It relays every thirty mins my location and my kids can see where I'm at on a map. 
It was a light day of hiking, gradual up and slight down. I'm trying to acquire trail legs- it will take a few weeks to do so. Took a slight tourist detour- stopped at Hickory Flats Cemetery. This is an old cemetery with head stones that where very worn- couldn't read them. The church that owns it had a plastic flower at each stone. There was also a pavilion with a sign the said Campers welcome. There was a privy which we used. (&Better then digging a hole in the woods... )
Camped at Hawk mountain shelter area- As I was setting up my hammock, I found a heart shaped rock that glittered- I feel it was a reminder of my son and Heavenly Father sending me love! 
Met nice people- one showed me how to start my stove! There was a group of men that met at their kids swim team practice. The were out for just a section hike. (A section hike is when you hike sections of the AT over several years-and finish it without doing it in one year to qualify it as a thru hike)
The wind was blowing cold, worried it would rain- it's in the forecast. It was windy but no rain!
I was toasty warm in my hammock with the under quilt and top quilt.

J-walk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558204,"Day 3 -Friday Hawk mountain shelter to Justus creek Over Sassafrass and Justus Mountains- up and down, up and down my calfs were screaming!! It was a Hard day- calfs are sore, my feet are burning and prickly, checked for blisters couldn't see any. We thought one mountain was 3 because it had 3 summits so we thought we were almost thru, but realized we still had one more mountain - 2 & 1/2 miles to go! The inclines are steep- filled with steps and roots to trip you up. Not very many switch backs- kinda of straight up and straight down. We finally made it the Justus creek to find we need to walk down a flight of stones stairs to the creek then over the creek on a log then up a flight of stairs then a hill to get to the camp area. We passed a South Bound Thru hiker today that was finishing up his hike - he started last October - he hiked thru the winter-his name was Happy Pants! We Hiked on and off with a son and father-Liam and Sam. Liam lives in Salt Lake City, his dad is from Montana-such nice people. Met a lot of nice people on the trail today most of them passing us. Nice people at the campsite too. Young men(20's), a girl from Brazil (she arrived in America last Friday , went to REl on Saturday and bought all her hiking equipment. The boys helped us hang out bear bags. So tired- been taking vitamin I (ibuprofen) trying not to be so sore. Worried about the rain it is predicted for the next few days. We need to be up earlier tomorrow morning - going to do another 6-7 Miles's to Woody Gap where we have arranged for a shuttle to take us to the Hiker Hostel near Dahlonega -we will stay there for three nights and slack pack from Woody Gap to Jarrard Gap and then Jarrard Gap to Neel gap/Mountain Crossings where I have a drop box waiting. (A drop box is a box that is mailed ahead to a place you are hiking to, I have packed some food and items for resupply) Hard to fall asleep- I'm cold then too warm, I think too tired to sleep. Almost ten good night. 
(Picture is of one of the few flat spots in the trail today and it shows the white blaze on the tree. The AT is mark with blazes to lead the way. Sometimes when hiking I'm concentrating on the ground so much watching for rocks, roots or anything that can trip me up, I forget to look for the white blaze! )","Hawk Mountain Shelter

J-walk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558206,"Up early today- not much sleep. Packed up my camp and headed on the trail early. Didn't eat a hot breakfast, ate a protein bar along the first mile. Made a privy pit stop at Gooch Mountain Shelter just 1.4 miles away from where we camped. Met two trail maintainers- The AT luxuries like the privy exsist because of these trail volunteers, they hike in and maintain the shelters and privies- I'm grateful for these folks who willing do this so we can enjoy the trail today!   Hiked down about 1.3 miles to Gooch Gap. At the Gap area people could drive their cars up, park and section hike. We got to see Miss Janet a ledgend Trail Angel-she has been a hiker support from Georgia to Maine for years- driving hikers and encouraging them. 
A Church group =Trail Angels=had set up camp at Gooch Gag. Trail Magic=they had food for hikers- fruit bananas & apples, hot beverages (Hot Chocolate for me!) Oatmeal, yogart and toppings! Yum!! They also had a garbage can! This might not seem like much but for hikers it was awesome! Because we conscientious Hikers carry out all of our own trash we try to leave no trace behind on the trail. So having a trash cans helps us get rid of our garbage and that lightens our loads (even if it's only a few ounces! Every ounce counts when you are carrying it in your back!) The trail was a mix of up down, rocky, & smooth. I haven't figured out how to post more than one picture on each one of these journal entries so check out all my photos on the photo page- you can see more of what I'm talking about. About a half a mile from Woody Gap I could feel hot spots on my feet in multiple places . I stopped and checked and I couldn't really see blisters again, but later in day at the hostel I found multiple blisters on the bottom of my feet and my toes in the side of my feet -painful!! When we came out at Woody Gap, there were some more Trail Angels (a family that wants to help hikers each year for two days) they had set up a barbecue, they were making hamburgers and hotdogs. They also had chips and water and fruit and protein bars. It was a great late lunch/ early dinner to have as we waited for the 5 o'clock shuttle from the hostle.  The shuttle picked us up and we went to the hostle. It was fun it was a lot of different people they're getting ready to go on their first day of hiking and several that were like us that wanted to stay somewhere to leave their gear so they could slack pack. The hostile Drove anybody who wanted to go to Walmart in Dahlonega to resupply. I went in search of better blister Band-Aids and Non freeze dried food for a snack- got a salad!!! I called my daughter who lives about an hour and a half away and asked if she could bring up my alternative hiking boots the next day and extra socks she said she could. She new I was having a bad moment and so her and her kids all texted me encouraging words and pictures- I felt very loved! Had a nice hot shower, treated my blisters, and went to bed early.","Justus Creek

My daughter and her husband drove up to where I'm staying (they are only about 1&1/2 hours away) they brought me my back up boots and different socks. About 20 yrs ago I broke both my feet- one Foot has 6 pins and plate on the ankle and heel- I have a hard time finding shoes that are wide enough. These Blisters are letting me know I need to change out boots! Also I'm allergiic to lanolin and the merino wool socks aren't working- changing to sinthetic.So grateful my daughter lives close enough in the first stage of my hike so I can get these details ironed out.,"Woody Gap

Her husband was also military he died while serving. We talked for while. I love meeting people on the trail and hearing their stories. She saw me checking my blisters and she offered me some padded tape and padded toe sleeve she brought back from Europe. She whipped out here utility knife cut the blister supplies to fit and doctored my blisters= trail magic!! <3. Sure made my day and hike more comfortable! Just after talking to her I saw a big heart rock- what a great confirmation that there's good people in this world!My hike today was a good one to do after taking a zero day.

J-walk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558605,"Slack packed from Jarrard Gap up over Blood Mountain to Neel Gap. (Backpack was transported to Neel Gap/Mountain Crossings to pick up after hike) Blood Mountain has a reputation for being a hard climb (2 miles steep up to top). I was really surprised it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. It was a little sketchy coming down- it had slabs of rocks that could lead you the wrong way going down- had to really pay attention to the white blazes. It had been cloudy but when we got to the top the sun was shining and there was a spectacular view looking out over the mountain tops! This world is Beautiful!
When I got to the bottom to Neel Gap I took a picture by the same AT sign I had stood by back in July 2016. (I had come up to Neel Gap with my daughters family to check out the area and think about hiking the AT.) I called my daughter and got emotional because I couldn't believe I had already hiked over 30 miles and 8 months ago hiking the AT was just a dream!! 
Went into Mountain Crossing (an outfitters) it is located in a historical conservation Corps building which now the outfitters and a Hostel are. The Corps stayed there as the constructed Blood Mountain Shelter and part of the AT in 1937.
At MountainCrossings I tried on new boots- still struggling with painful feet. I had them set aside a pair to be taken to Hiawasee in case I decided to change boots altogether. I bought a pair of non-wool socks. They are more like sock liners but I thought I would try them because feet are still hot and prickly. Also bought a snickers bar and picked up my drop box ( a box of supplies mailed ahead to resupply mostly food and sundry items. I of course sent to much, so I only took out a few protein bars and dinners and resent box to pick up in Hiawassee. I went thru my backpack and got rid of a few things I realized I didn't really need- I donated those items to a ""Hiker Box"" (a box hikers put unwanted items and other hikers can go through the box and have what ever they want.) Then we hiked up passed Neel Gap about a mile to stealth camp. I was trying to hang my bear bag and the rock sack got stuck in the tree! I asked a few of the young men to see if they could get it out- no luck! Ugh! Thankfully I was able to hang my food bag with my friend. My hammock kept sinking lower(the tree was so big around had a hard time hook it properly around the tree)

My daughter and her husband came and picked me up at Mountain Crissing. I hiked back down to Mountain Crossings. As I waited to be picked up I got a pack shake down. My pack today weighed in at 28. 9 lbs. with 1 liter of water, food and gear. I was so pleased! I have been getting rid of things over the past week that I didn't think I needed- paid off! As I laid out my gear from my back pack, the mountain crossings owner would ask about certain things if I really needed it. Also he gave a lot suggestions how to condense and pack better. It really helped me realize what was important to carry and what was not. Picked up, went to my daughters. Went thru my drop boxes, did laundry and got some rest.

J-walk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559044,"Started at Hogpen Gap itvwas a beautiful day. Met a lady, Patty, from Tennessee. I remember meeting her on the trail a couple of days ago. She passed me as I was taping up a toe.  Made it in record time for me to Low Gap -I was hiking about 2 miles hour I know this doesn't sound like much but when you are hiking up and down steep hills it's hard to go fast. My initial plan was to stay at Low Gap shelter, but it was way too early in the day to stop hiking and set up camp. So I kept hiking on. Came to a small water fall, so I stopped & filtered water. I have learned not to carry more water than I have to- not carry water to water, 1 liter of water weighs 2.2 lbs. I have a platypus Gravity Works water filter that is light weight, uses gravity, a dirty and clean water bags. So I fill up the dirty bag with the stream water, I hang it up higher than the clean bag, and I attach the hosing which comes out of the dirty bag to the water filter and then to the clean bag. The process of filtering uses gravity so I don't have to pump or squeeze water through a filter. At the water fall I met a nice couple that lives locally in north Georgia that was out on a day hike. I arrived to my plan B campsite and it was still early. I was hiking faster because the trail was an old logging road and it was smother than other parts of the trail so far. I kept hiking on and about 3:00 I was sitting on a log taking a break after hiking 8.5 miles. I was looking at my map trying to find a place to stop for the night. I was really tired by then and there wasn't a flat place to set up a tent or water. 
Patty came walking by, which surprised- she had stopped for lunch and didn't realize I passed her. I told her I think I was to tired to go on. She invited me to hike on with her. She has The Guthook's AP which is a GPS map. Patty knew where we were. I kept thinking I was close to a camping area from how I was reading my map. There was still 2.5 miles to go. Those last 2.5miles took us about 3 &1/2 hours. The was hiking on the side of the mountain over rocks of a dry creek bed or water fall. Stepping carefully was essential to staying on the trail and not ending up at the bottom of hill. . I ran then out of water. Finally found a small water source- I was really glad to have my filter because of the debris in the water. Finally got to our camp sight just 1 mile short of the Blue mountain shelter- that's 10.6 miles! That's the farthest I've hiked so far in one day!! 
Set up camp, Patty and 4 other hikers camped there too. I was going to get more water but it was .3 miles down the trail. To tired to get it. Use what I had, made dinner and went to bed@8:30.

We had gone to breakfast at a little coffee shop which had the best hot chocolate (they use Ghirardelli chocolate!) We asked a cute older couple if they could give us a ride to the theater- they did, they were concerned about how we'd get back- we said we'd manage. When the movie was over we were talking to another older couple the wife offered for her husband Paul to drive us back to town before their movie started- he did. When we pulled into the hotel parking lot he asked if he could say a prayer with us. He asked for protection and success to make it Maine and to praise Jesus.

They had a delicious salad bar and for main foods fried chicken, mashed potatoes/gravy, turnip greens cornbread and more. Grocery shopped for a couple of more meals. Going to try carrying cheese and pepperoni this time see how it tastes and lasts. Back to the Hostel. Lots of laughter- one hiker guy who is 29 said he's visited 32 different countries. So we counted them off to see who has been to more- him or I. I won by one country! Another young 20 year old boy with long hair saw that I braided my hair, he asked me to braid his down the center front to the back- so I did. Hard to sleep with so many snoring and one girl coughing.

I had a bit of trouble with my 2nd tower on my left food- I'm losing a toe which pokes me every time I walk  stop and wrapped my toe. After that I could walk faster. The last few miles of the day were a bit nerve racking. I've been trying to carry less water, but getting water along the way -trying not to carry water to water. A spring that was marked as having water in the at guide book didn't have following water so I continued done the trail. I was almost out of water and a hiker came up behind me, I asked if he knew when the next sping was- he fidntb. But he had extra water in his filtering bag which he gave to me- it was only a half of a 16 oz bottle. Just as I was getting worried and not sure how far down the trail I was- I heard water. It was a stream about 50 feet off the trail down a steep incline. I climbed down and got water to filter. Started back on the trail, turned the corner and there was the tree that marked the boarder of Georgia & North Carolina! After taking a picture I turned another corner and there was a stream and Bly Gap!! Today I exceeded my expection of how far I'd walk! I'm in North Carolina!!","Dicks Creek Gap

However the plants and trees in NC are turning green or blooming. There's more wild flowers and the greenery has changed- black burnt spots mixed with green plants popping up. There's also biting flies and nats- bug spray does not prevent them from biting!! The terrain changed a bit too- more rocky in places and also gradual ups and downs mix with sharp switchback inclined. Hiked a Nero day (means almost no miles). It started raining as I arrived at the muskrat shelter. I decided to stay- I just did not want a wet tent or back pack! It was a lot of fun at the shelter there was probably about 20-30 people that came in out of the rain. It was fun talking to all the people, learning there trail names like River, Fist Bump, Chicago/whose behind me, Medicine man, April Showers, and Popsie are the ones I remember. 4 of us slept in the shelter. The rest braved the rain and set up tents or hammocks. Towards bedtime the rain stopped. Hung our bear bags. 8:30 hikers midnight.","Bly Gap

For The first 2 miles some parts of the trail were just barely there with a sheer drop down the mountain. I couldn't look down it made me to anxious! Then came the approach trail .3 up the side of rocky Albert Mountain. I could see the fire tower on the top of the mountain. I was trying to wrap my mind around the fact that I'd hike that up there! In places the trail was huge rook steps that I couldn't step up onto, so I crawled up on my hands and knees. Couldn't use my hiking poles much because there was no where to plant them and I needed to use my hands to hold onto the rocks. It was also precarious because if I leaned back to far my 30# backpack would start to pull me backwards - where I didn't want to fall! So I half crawled and climbed. I had to remember to breathe! I couldn't look up or down just a foot or two in front of me as I climbed. I made it!!! I know it's just a taste of what's to ahead in a few states! I arranged for a shuttle driver to pick me up on the other side of the tower at the 100 mile mark! 100 miles- woohoo !I was ready to go to town to resupply, wash clothes and get something done with my shoes. . And tomorrow is Easter and I want to go to church. The shuttle driver, a through Hiker named Hometown, had a lot of insights and suggestions for hiking the AT. He took me into Franklin NC to a hotel. I showered and then ate Mexican food, walked to laundry mat to do laundry. At the laundry mat I lost my sons fleece hat he used to wear when he was in the military when he'd practice parachuting  I have been wearing it to sleep in with my buff round it to hold it in place- it has kept me so warm! I stopped at Iutdoor76 outfitters were my daughter had sent a drop box with a lot of resupplies! Went to Dollar General to finish re supplying.","Betty Creek Gap

She Introduced me to everyone she greeted an we sat together for all the meetings. I was so happy to be to Church on Easter- the talks on Jesus's Atonement and his Resurrection were were wonderful. I Loved the other lessons on Jesus's life and how to follow him. I'm grateful for all that Jesus has done for me- he lives and I know because of him we will see those who have passed on- Families are Forever!

I bought a cheep rain poncho to use when warm-it covers myself and my part of my backpack- this helps so the rain does slide down between me and my back pack- I still use my pack rain cover too. I was planning to stay at the Siler Bald Shelter, I realized when I was almost to the shelter that it was .5 mile from the trail. When I got to the shelter it was full and a lot of tents up already. I still had time in the day so I pressed on and end at stealth camp site halfway to Wayah Bald mountain. The sun was shinning which made setting up my tent easier.

I was able to pack them without carrying the extra water they hold when wet!Went up over Wayah Bald to where there's a stone tower that you can climb up to the top and see for miles. Beautiful Views! However it was so sad to see the results of the forest fire that had come thru there last fall. So much damage- trees burnt, the towers roof burnt off. I'm glad it was a nice morning so I could see the view! 
Storm clouds started moving in. Called a Hostel that is located not to far from Burningtown Gap, made arrangements to be picked up from that Gap. Made good time even though I twisted my ankle stepping on a loose rock going down hill. (New shoes don't have much ankle support- which is problematic )

You could see for miles and miles.  I realized on my hike today that until you really walk in someone else's shoes and have their feet, its just a guess at what they are feeling and how they are doing.  No one can tell you that your shoes fit but yourself!  I called my daughter from the trail and decided I would stop hiking until I get my foot look at. Bitter sweet day. I really do love hiking, love the trail.  If only my foot would cooperate.

One gentleman was from France and he spoke no English. To communicate we talked with our hands and pointed to items and places. He spent over an hour on the phone speaking in french - he must be lonely and needed to talk to someone who understood him! Yesterday I met two hikers that were deaf.  They were asking me questions and I finally spelled out using sign language alphabet the answers. It was fun cause they taught me signs for the different wods - however I can't remember them today.  It is amazing the variety of people who hike the trail, from all over the world, with varying abilities.
