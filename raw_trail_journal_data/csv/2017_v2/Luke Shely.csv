Anyways, today mom and dad dropped me off at Amicalola Falls State Park. Tonight I will sleep in the Max Epperson Shelter with 3 South Africans, John-o, Gareth, and David, and a veteran Appalachian trail hiker who's trail name is quiver. They are all really nice guys and I've already learned a lot from quiver. Tomorrow we will all begin the the 8.5 mile approach trail to the Appalachian trail head. I'm glad I brought ear plugs because it's only 7 and quiver is already snoring.","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559038,"Today I hiked the approach trail and .2 miles of the Appalachian trail. There was rain sleet and snow all in one day. I was dripping in sweat while I hiked, regardless of the cold. Then I would freeze my nuts off whenever I would take a break. But at the end of the day I ate a big meal and I'm not hurt yet so all is good.","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559292,"I just finished day three of hiking. I've averaged 8 miles a day so far. I'm taking it really slow the first week or two so I don't get hurt. Going slow means I'm also going to run out of food faster. I'll be able to re supply in two days. I have enough food to get me there but I'm going to be starving when I get to town. I need to lose weight anyways.  Since I've only been hiking 8 miles a day I get to camp pretty early and see a lot of people pass through. The other day there were 3 girls that passed through. Shortly after 10 guys came along asking about them. They didn't know the girls but you could tell they were trying to catch up so they could hit on them. Apparently this is called pink blazing, which is a spin off of the white blazes that mark the AT.","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559617,"I'm looking out of my tent at a great view while I type this. It's been a good day. I hiked up and down blood mountain which was a tough hike with my one pasta side left for breakfast. Then I re supplied on food at a hostel in Neels Gap, which was much need. At the hostel they cooked me a frozen pizza while I waited for my phone to charge. I ate the whole thing and half of someone else's. Then I ate an orange, a sleeve of sugar donuts and 2 oatmeal cream cookies. I was hungry, but that was lunch and dinner. After that I hiked another 3 miles to camp. I was scared to get water at Neels Gap because they told another through hiker that the hostel was closed due to hikers getting sick from parasites being brought in. They must have lied because we soon found out that the problem was coming from there well water. Even the bathrooms were closed and portajohns where outside. That's the main reason I hiked 3 miles out. There has even been a few people I met that are getting sick. At my camp last night a guy was up all night vomiting. Everyone is talking about Nora virus too, so I stopped shaking people's hands. I'll fist bump them but no more hand shakes. I'm sure half of these people don't wash there hands after they poop. I do agree that it is a hassle when you don't have a sink, but it is necessary. Anyways, I'll keep my fingers crossed that I don't come down with anything. I couldn't upload the picture. I'll have to figure it out later.","

I'm at mile 93.something on the AT. The rest last night was great. Then today for Easter we ate at Martha's kitchen. It was some good home style country cooking, but nothing is better than grandma and papa's house. And uncle Michael has them beat on the chicken and dumplings. I felt so rejuvenated that I put more miles in today than I had originally planned and ended up catching up to some cool people that I've been hiking on and off with for the week, so today was a good day.","

It was originally only going to be 12 but the people I was hiking with got a ride to Franklin with some hippies and stayed at a hostel. Once they were gone me and a guy named chef decided that we couldn't let them have all the fun so we hiked another 4 miles to the road and hitch hiked to the hostel. It was full so we stayed in our tents outside. My tent got wet, but it was worth it because I saw almost everyone I have met so far in town. It was a mini AT reunion. It has been poring rain today so I only hiked about 5 miles. I also need to rest my feet from yesterday. Last night a few people who didn't have trail names were given one. I don't have a permanent trail name yet, but I've been called sky walker, big boy and cool hand. I think cool hand might stick.","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561322,"It's been a while since I've blogged so I'll try to catch y'all up. Also, don't pay attention to the mileage on the blog because it calculates it as if I blog every day and I sometimes forget to put the daily mileage in. Right now I am at Fontana Dam, which is 166 miles into the AT. The two days after I left Franklin most of the trail was scorched from a wild fire that happened a week or so before. An old man who picked me up on my hitch hike into town said that the fire was caused by arson. He also said that the boy who started it was caught and taken to jail. I'm just glad they re opened the section of trail before I got there. The next day, chief cowgirl and I hiked down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center and had lunch at a restaurant by the river while we watched whitewater kayakers paddle around in the rapids. Chief finished his section hike so he is no longer with us, but he was fun to hike with though. He would always run downhill if the rocks and roots allowed it and whenever we would get to a spot with a view he would do a crazy scream the would echo three or four times through the mountains. After lunch at the NOC, we hike about 6.5 miles uphill to camp with an almost 3000 feet gain in elevation. I'd say it was the hardest climb yet. Yesterday I arrived at Fontana Dam where there was another awesome trail magic set up. They had hamburgers, hotdogs, slaw, eggs, donuts, donut buns for the hamburgers, brownies, Debbie cakes, oranges, bananas, sodas, beer, ice cream sundays, and even hotel shampoos and soaps. It was all free. It will be hard to beat that trail magic. I am learning that it pays to make it to a parking lot on the weekends, because there seems to be some sort of trail magic available. After eating some trail magic, dad took me to a hotel for the night. It's been raining on and off for the past 24 hours so I am debating on wether to start the smokies now or in the morning. Also, I still don't have a trail name. It amazes me how many people haven't seen cool hand Luke. I know it's an old movie, but it's a classic and a lot of people that are older that me haven't even seen it, so I guess it won't be cool hand.","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563171," I haven't had service for a long time, so sorry for the delay. I decided to start the smokies on Sunday as the rain was coming through. I had talked to a local at the visitors center who said it's rainy in the smokies 5 days a week in the spring time so I bit the bullet. The first day out of Fontana the Appalachian trail turned into the Appalachian river. I got soaked to the bone. During the 11 mile hike to camp I was hoping for a spot in the shelter. The shelter has a capacity of 12. There were 23 people crammed in like sardines, so I set my tent up in the rain. Although the first day in there park was cold wet and miserable I got to see another 14 wild bore cross the trail 20 yards in front of me. There were 4 adults and a bunch of baby's. It was a little scary because wild bore will occasionally attack people. The second day was just as cold and wet, and the trail was a disaster. When going uphill, my feet would slide back in the mud making it take twice as long. And downhill was mud skiing. It amazing only one person broke their ankle. One night in a wet tent was enough, so I got up early and beat everyone to the next shelter. That night we had 20 crammed in a 12 person shelter, but it was warmer and dryer than a tent. We even made a fire, thanks to the fire place built into the shelter. The next day we made it to Clingmans Dome, which is the highest peak on the Appalachian trail. That morning was just as misty and wet as the last, so it didn't look like we were going to get any breathtaking views. But as we reached the top of Clingmans, the mist cleared up just enough for a spectacular view that made the last 2 and a half days all worth it. When I looked North the mountain was sticking out of the clouds. It was as if you were taking off from an airplane and you paused everything right as you broke through the clouds. When you looked behind you to the south, the clouds were creeping over the ridge and you could see Fontana lake and standing Indian, where we were 40 miles ago. Pictures don't do justice. The next day was sunny and beautiful. There were views the entire day. I left my sunscreen because i thought there was no way I could get sunburnt. Sure enough, I got a nice backpack burn cause I wasn't wearing a shirt. The next day was back to misty rain. In the smokies I met a group of guys my age that went to high school together and are hiking the trail together as well. There names are galaxy pirate, turbo snail, and coach. I stayed with them all the way to hot springs. Cowgirl, pirate, wild card, and the mechanic caught up to me in hot springs as well. I ended up staying in a cabin with pirate, cowgirl, French press, and anvil, who was a new addition to there crew and has a thing with cowgirl. You could hear them smacking lips on the top bunk. I just put my earplugs in. Apparently I snored a lot the two nights we stayed in the cabin, so that group started calling me snoring rock. But coach and the other guys have been calling me sky walker. I still don't have a permanent trail name. Anyways, the French broad river goes through hot spring and I remembered rafting part of it with my youth group when I was in high school. I also remember the raft guide pointing out a train bridge that you can jump off of into the water. I told everyone about it and tried to get a big group to go swimming. The bridge ended up being a mile or so down the tracks from our cabin. Turbo snail, galaxy pirate, coach, black foot, night rider, and Molotov all came and it was a blast. The tracks were about 30 feet above the water and there was a rope swing. While we were swimming and hanging out on the bridge, the train went by causing the whole bridge to vibrate. I didn't bring my phone for pictures. But coach got it all on his go pro. It ended up being a great zero day. Today I left hot springs. I was looking at the map earlier to see how far until I can get a ride into Boone and I should be there about a week from now. I'm pumped to see my friends before I get to far away. ","

My backpack broke right before I got to Boone. The back brace broke off at the bottom of the pack where the hip belt is. My moms friend and coworker Kat is letting me borrow hers for the rest of the hike. Thank you so much Kat. During one of my zero days me and some friends paddled some canoes around price lake. There has been a handful of beautiful waterfalls on the trail recently. Tomorrow my buddy Sterling is coming to hike a 40 mile section to Damascus, VA with me. ","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565208,"The first day of Sterling's section on the AT, we walked around part of the Watauga Lake and across the Dam. It was a beautiful sunny day, and a hot 80 something degrees. I probably drank 6 liters of water on the climb to the shelter. I was walking with sunglasses on and thankful no earbuds in because about a mile from the shelter I heard rattling. I stopped immediately and took my sunglasses off to see where it was coming from. There was a four foot rattlesnake a foot and a half away from me on the side of the trail. I backed away slowly before taking pictures, but it scared the b-Jesus out of me. My legs were shaking a little. Coach wasn't far behind me so I waited for him to catch up so I could worn him. It was way to close to the trail and we couldn't decide wether to shoo it away or not. We came to the conclusion that it would just make it angry for the next hiker, so we gave the snake some space and it slithered across the trail and into the woods. When we got to the shelter, there was a beautiful view of the lake. You could even see the ridiculous eye sore of a hotel on top of sugar mountain in the distance. While we were at the shelter a guy was talking about why the Watauga shelter was closed because of bears. He said that someone got footage of two cub bears climbing the trees where hikers hang their food. They would then climb out in the limbs and drop the food bags to the mama bear and they would all run off. I'm glad we camped far from that shelter. The next day, when we got to where we were planning to camp, there was a couple at the camp spot. They hadn't set up yet, but I politely asked them if they minded us camping there too and they said that they didn't mind, so we started setting up our tents. When they left, I noticed fresh peanut butter smeared on a log near where the guy was sitting. I didn't see him do it, but I don't know who else would have left peanut butter on a log where we were camping. Whoever did it is childish. We got it cleaned up though, and it's a good thing because shortly after, a hiker passing by said he saw a giant black bear 2 miles back. Also, the next morning, french press, who camped .1 miles south of us said he was night hiking and was spooking animals that sounded really big about half a mile from us. He didn't see a bear, but he didn't know what else it could have been. Today was another beautiful day. It was flatter than the previous days, but there is a lot more people on the trail because trail days starts tomorrow. I'm surprised we have a campsite to ourselves tonight. Oh, and one more snake story, while we were hiking this afternoon I stepped on a snake. I wouldn't have known it if Sterling wasn't hiking behind me to watch me do it. We could tell what kind it was because it slithered off pretty fast. ","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566801,"Trail Days was a good time. There was tons of free stuff. They even had disaster relieve trucks ran by churches and volunteers that would wash our clothes while we took a shower. It was nice to catch up with people I hadn't seen in a while. I camped on the edge of the quiet end of tent city. The quiet area was in a field. As you walked further into the woods of tent city the party got crazier until you reached the drum circle where a bunch of half naked people where dancing around a fire to the beat of the drums. I left trail days a day early so I could beat the bubble of hikers out of Damascus. The next 5 days it rained. Every afternoon the rain would start at around 1 or 2 and go into the night. The rain was doing a number on my morale, but Wyatt came and took me to a motel for the night when the worst of the storm was coming through. Thanks Wyatt. I needed that. The sun finally came out on Friday thank goodness. Today I'm camping at dismal falls. It's a beautiful spot. I'll probably hangout here til the afternoon. I hear you can catch crawfish at the falls. If I can catch enough I'll cook them for lunch. ","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567732,"I couldn't catch enough crawfish at Dismal worth cooking, but I did go for a swim. The  weather for the past week and a half has been nice. It did rain here and there, which isn't bad when you get to dry your stuff out the next day. By then the weather had already done its damage to my shoes. When I got to Pearisburg I noticed an inch long hole on the sides of my shoes where the mesh connects to the sole. Pearisburg didn't have anywhere to buy shoes except Walmart so I patched them up with shoe goo hoping I could make it to the outfitter in Daleville 90 miles away. The shoe goo lasted about 15 miles. When I was going down a hill the next day, the goo cracked and the inch long hole turned into a 7 inch hole from my toes almost to my ankle. I patched it up with athletic tape first which lasted about 8 miles. Then I used all the duct tape I had. When that wore out a kind day hiker who was training for the trail let me use his. Then when that started to where out, I gutted some para cord that I had in my pack and tied that around my shoes. The shoes made it to a dumpster in Daleville where I got a much needed new pair. No more trail runners for me. The past few weeks I have been pushing myself a little harder than I should. I am no longer going to try to keep up with people or compare my daily mileage to someone else's. All that will do is get me injured. Doing to many miles was making me sick. I was getting fevers at night and was nauseous during part of the day. So I did 9 miles instead of 19, got a goodnight sleep and was better the next day. Feeling better made the hike up dragons tooth and Macafee knob, the famous picture spot, more enjoyable.","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568281,"Instead of staying in a motel in Daleville, I saw that there was free camping at a park in troutville. When I got to the park, it didn't seem like the type of park you would camp in. There were a bunch of kids playing on swings and slides. There were basketball courts, a tennis court, and a walking track. I felt like a creepy hobo camping in a park with a children playing outside my tent, but I wasn't alone. There were some cyclists biking all the way to California who camped with me next to the volleyball net. The next morning I woke up to people getting their morning exercise in on the track, charged my phone under the pavilion, and got back on the trail. The next night I met two guys, Jason and Boomer, who also went to App State. The three of us and a girl from Montreal named Red Eye have been hiking together for the past view days. Since I left Troutville, the days have been beautiful and sunny. I started getting up a little earlier because it's been about 90 degrees the past 2 or 3 days. I think I prefer the heat over the rain. Yesterday the four of us jumped in the James river to cool off as kayakers paddled by. Then today when I got to camp I was so hot I sat down in the creek beside our camp and took a bath. It felt fantastic. ","

He maimed me with his history lessons, took me out for good local food, showed me the town, helped me get what I needed for the trail, and took me to the doctor to get my bum ankle checked out.

Harpers Ferry is considered the spiritual halfway point of the AT at mile 1123, but it is 70 miles shy of the actual halfway point. My stomach didn't feel right yesterday when I was leaving town. I just assumed it was the greasy seven eleven pizza I ate the night before. When I got to the first shelter, I took a break and ate some Nutella and bread and hung out until the rain stopped. While I was there, wildcard showed up. We started the trail the same day and I hadn't seen him in a month and a half so it was nice to catch up. When we left to go to the next campsite 4 miles away, I started getting really nauseous. My throat would close as if I was about to spew but I didn't. Hiking sick is not fun. When we got to the campsite, all the bending over and standing up from setting up camp made me spew. I vomited throughout the night, thankfully not in my tent. It will be a while until I can eat Nutella again. Today I left camp at 3 in the afternoon and got 7 miles in. Although I feel much better now, I still don't have my hiker appetite back. ","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571337,"I got rid of whatever bug I had. Then the next day I made it to the halfway point. Just after the halfway point, there was a store that is known for the famous half gallon challenge for thru hikers. You have to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting. During my years in college I thought I was starting to develop a lactose intolerance. Now I am certain that I am lactose intolerant. To do the challenge, you get a tub of ice cream out of their freezer, like you would get at the grocery store. I picked chocolate chip cookie dough, my moms favorite. The first three fourths of the tub was easy. When I was getting to the end I had to start forcing it down. It was a sugar overload more than anything. I think I added up the sugar in the tub to 300 something grams and over 2000 calories. The thing is, the tub is only 1.5 quarts, so once you finish that you have to go back to pick out another pint that they stuff into a large styrofoam cup. I picked crazy vanilla. It took me about 30 minutes to finish that last pint, but I did it. After letting the ice cream settle I surprisingly didn't feel that bad so I decided to start hiking again. About 2 miles in I started getting really gassy. I tooted my way down the flat section, and as soon as I started going uphill it hit me. I dug a hole as fast as I could and exploded diarrhea. Can you believe that a store that has an ice cream eating challenge for hikers doesn't sell toilet paper? Me either. So I used a stack of napkins to clean the carnage. I had to frantically dig three more shallow graves for that stinking half gallon before I got to camp. It will be a long time before I eat ice cream again, and when I do, it will be lactose free. ","

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572770,"My parents came to visit this past week. It was nice to hangout with them since it had been a couple months. I got to sleep in a bed for a while, they helped me slack pack, and they fattened me up. I'm in New Jersey now and halfway done with the states. Jersey is known for its bear problems on the trail so I'm staying by shelters for a while. Sometimes people like to be funny and put an outlet in the shelter  that obviously isn't going to work. This shelter has a TV dish on top. When I had my unpleasant bowel movements a couple weeks ago, I didn't pay attention to where I was squatting and got some poison ivy on my left butt cheek, but it's gone now so no worries. Speaking of smelly things, I've been meaning to talk about smells on the trail. When I started the AT, it didn't take long for me and everyone else to started smelling really bad. No one wears deodorant because it weighs too much when you are going to stink anyways, and most people go a week or two in between showers and laundry. Eventually my clothes got to the point where, after washing them, when I went to open the dryer the stench was still there, just more faint. In other words, it didn't burn the nostrils like they did when they were going in the washer. After about 3 weeks on the trail, I started to get used to mine and everyone else's stench. Although I don't think I could ever get used to the smell of the shelters in the  smokies. With a tarp over the front and twenty people inside with their wet clothes and almost a week without a shower, that smell is hard to beat. Also, after being out in the woods for a long time your sense of smell is noticeably heightened. In every day life you are around all kinds of things that are scented, such as candles, detergent, soap, perfume, cologne, air fresheners, etc. After being away from that for a while, it is more intense the next time you smell it. Now I can smell day hikers minutes before I even see them. When they get closer, I can practically pick out what detergent they use. If a girl is wearing a lot of perfume, and the wind is right, I can smell her from half a mile away. It's a little creepy. If I can smell that well, you know the bears can smell much better. ","

I also met John Mellencamp's gardener. He hiked the trail in the past and did a lot of trail magic for us and camped with us one night. There may be a chance that I will be in the background of a cialis commercial. I don't know for sure that it was a commercial for cialis, but there was a big camera crew that said they were making a pharmaceutical commercial and there was an old guy in front of the camera so thats what I'm guessing. The further north we get the worse the bugs are. There are mosquitoes everywhere. I think I'm gonna get one of those bug nets that go over your head to keep the bugs out of my eyes, ears, and lungs. Unfortunately our little trail crew will be splitting up again. Jason and Boomer are going to New York City for a week and Redeye's visa runs out too soon so she is skipping ahead.

A couple of days ago Spills, Scout, and their friend Matty, who is out for a section, took a nero with me at Sages Ravine near the Massachusetts and Connecticut border. We slept in, hiked four miles, then hung out by the water and swam in the swimming holes all day. It was a nice break. The next day we stayed at the Berkshire community center in Great Barrington. Last night was the first proper shower that I've had in two weeks. I did shower about a week ago at a campsite but the shower was nasty and no one had soap, so me and the guy in the shower next to me took turns going out into the bathroom, quickly pumping the hand soap on the wall and running back into the shower with a handful. I took three trips out to the soap dispenser. My next shower experience was in Kent Connecticut where they had a public shower on the outside of a bathroom in town. The shower didn't have a roof over it and it was 85 degrees and sunny. Since the walls kept the breeze out, I started sweating as I got ready to shower. It cost two dollars for a four minute shower so I got naked before putting the quarters in so that I was sure to get my money's worth. I put the quarters in and the thing was broken, leaving me standing their naked and sweaty with disappointment. It's ok though. I got to swim in the  Housatonic River the next day. ","

Some think they are the hardest part of the whole AT. Others think that southern Maine is harder. Whenever the white mountains get brought up in conversation, people always talk about how unpredictable and dangerous the weather is there, and how quite a few people have died in those mountains.

Luke Shely,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576434,"Today is the third day in the white mountains. Thank goodness they aren't actually white from snow. They have been one of the most strenuous parts of the trail. The weather has been perfect so far. It has not been windy or rainy yet. The temperature is in the low forties at night, which is great for sleeping even though it makes it a little harder to get out of the sleeping bag in the morning. The first mountain we climbed was Moosilauke. I sweated all the way up the 4000 foot climb and about froze at the top because it was a little windy and it gets about 3 degrees colder for every thousand feet you go up. The key is to put more clothes on before you get to the top where it's windy and you stop to take in the view. One of the guys on the top of Moosilauke was wearing a warm top, but all he had on for bottoms was a rain skirt with nothing underneath it. I know there was nothing underneath it because the wind blew up the skirt, giving me a shocking view of his butt crack with the white mountains in the background. It was not the crevasse I was expecting to see at the top of a mountain. Also, later that evening we had a fire at camp. Rain skirt man was there, bending over to tend to the fire, giving us a view of his saggy scrotum. The next day we climbed Kinsman. Right before we did, someone said Kinsman is where the most legs are broken in the whites. Today we climbed little haystack, mount Lincoln, mount Lafayette, mount Garfield, and south twin mountain. We only hiked 11 miles but it feels like 20. I don't think New Hampshire nows what switchbacks are. They just send you straight up and down cliffs. Although it is more difficult. The views are very rewarding. The Whites are my favorite so far, with the smokies as a close second. ","

Our original plan was to go 11 miles to the lake of the clouds hut at the base of mount Washington, so I slept in. I didn't leave camp until 10. I caught up to Candyman, a guy who came out for a ten day section and ended up doing it with us because he hiked our pace. The morning was pretty rough as we climbed 4000 feet. Then when Candyman and I stopped for lunch at one of the huts we saw that the weather forecast didn't look too good for Washington. We decided to stick with our plan and just leave earlier in the morning. So the two of us took our time getting to lake of the clouds. The 3 or 4 miles before lake of the clouds is above tree line so you can see for miles. It was beautiful. When we got to the hut it was 5:30 and everyone was gone. Scout, spills, and JK had hiked on. When we went inside the hut the guys that work there recommended that we do the same. They said that it was going to be a -5 degree wind chill with 95 mile per hour gusts the next day and that if we didn't do it now we may get stuck at the hut for a day or two. So Candyman and I decided to hike over mount Washington. The problem was it was 5:30, there was nowhere to camp for another 6 miles, that campsite was a mile off the trail, and the next hut was 7.3 miles away. We saw a beautiful sunset on the other side of mount Washington, but then it got dark and we still had 5 miles to the hut, so we got our head lamps out and kept hiking. The 8 miles north of mount Washington is also above tree line so everything is rock. Since there are no trees to paint white blazes on and no defined trail due to everything being jagged rocks, they mark the trail with big piles of rocks called cairns. So for 2 and a half hours we would walk to a cairn stop and look for the next one and walk to it. It was a long night hike. When we finally got to the hut we had hiked 19 miles up and over the presidential mount range and it was 10 o clock which is way past my bed time. Hiker midnight is 9. But everyone was there. Even John Mellencamp's gardener who had come out to do a section. There were 15 thru hikers sleeping on the floor of the hut that night in order to beat the storm. We had to be out of the hut by 6:30 so I didn't get much sleep. When we were trying to hitch to town the next day I was nodding off with my thumb out. We were so exhausted that we decided to take a zero in Gorham. Gorham was the last town in New Hampshire. We stuck it out through all the pain and the rain and made it to Maine. But we weren't out of the woods yet. Maine has 281 miles of AT. Southern Maine is the hardest part of the AT. The trail in the whites was well maintained compared to southern Maine, because tons of tourists visit the national forest. It rained the first 4 days in Maine so all the cliffs we had to hike up and down were waterfalls. A guy a couple of days in front of us fell down one of these dangerous sections bruising his ribs and spraining both knees and ankles. They had to fly him out with a helicopter. When southern Maine isn't trying to walk you off a cliff, it tries to suck you into a bog. One of the first days in Maine, legs and minutes took one wrong step and ended up waist deep in mud. When I saw them at camp I found it pretty funny. Karma came my way, because I ended up stepping in mud up to my knee. I also slipped on a slick wooden board and almost did a split. When I stuck my arm out to catch myself it went into mud past my elbow. Maine is starting to chill out a little bit but I still have 220 miles to go. Although this blog may sound rough, I am still enjoying this experience. ","
