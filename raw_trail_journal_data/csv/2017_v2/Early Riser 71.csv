Early Riser 71,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554157,"Hey everyone. This is it...The first journal entry. I am planning on flying down to Atlanta on 15 Feb and spending the night at my dad's house. He will drive me up to Springer the morning of the 16th, after we stop by Amacalola Falls to sign the register. I will be vloging as well so feel free to check that out on my channel on YouTube...early_riser_71. 
I must admit that I am already dealing with the thoughts of missing my family, but opportunities like these come very seldom so I must take it. One step at a time, one water source to the next, one resupply every few days. Life is good...Go find your own journey and quit talking yourself out of it. Life is now!

Early Riser 71,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554474,"Getting pumped for the launch on Thursday 16 Feb. Long range weather is looking good for launch. Flying to ATL on Wednesday, staying with my dad, gonna eat a belly full of biscuits and gravy, and push northward. Life is good. I will definitely miss my family, but Teresa is a strong woman and I know they will be fine.","

Early Riser 71,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554560,"One more half-day at work on Tuesday, and a flight down to GA on Wednesday, is all that stands between me and launch. Really excited but the family is sick so I will hate leaving them if they are not getting better by then. Looking forward to being out in nature for such a long period. Such a rare opportunity. Those of us lucky enough to embark upon such a journey should not squander it. Good luck to all those throwing caution to the wind and pushing northward...","

Early Riser 71,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554626,"Flying to ATL right now to stage at my dad's house. He will drop me off at Springer in the morning. I know there will be some hard and mentally challenging times ahead, but none will compare to saying goodbye to the family today. They will be my motivation to keep pushing northward, but also my inspiration to stay heads up and enjoy the journey. Next update from the trail.","

Early Riser 71,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554700,"Great day. Really cold for first hour. Made it to Hawk MT Shelter for lunch by 11:20, stopped in at Gooch Mountain Shelter to meet the crew of folks that were staying there. Met Joe F. Dick, and Less early in the morning. There is a fairly large early bubble at both Hawk and Gooch Shelters. Hoping to stay ahead of it. Gonna try to get in to Neels Gap before they close. May shack up at the hostel? We will see. Appreciate all the support from everyone. I will try and keep this and YouTube updated. Goodnight all! All my love TCBC!","Springer

Early Riser 71,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554770,"Woke early, like 0345 early, and got hiking by 0545. Beautiful night hike while watching the sun go from a faint tint of pink to bursting over the horizon. Tough climbs today. I don't think Blood Mountain's climb was the worst. But the downhill definitely was. I passed a few thru hikers today and I am surprised how many are out here. The weather is unbelievable so I guess it is a great time to be hiking.
Gonna head to Blue mountain shelter tomorrow for another 17-mile day. Poised.to make it to the Top of GA hostel on Sunday
Gonna try and get some sleep now. Thanks for all the support. Posted my first hiking video on my channel on YouTube. Check it out if you wish.
