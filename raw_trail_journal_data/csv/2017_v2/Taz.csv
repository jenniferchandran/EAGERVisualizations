Taz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/416001,"I have never been able to shake this dream of an AT Thru Hike off. In 2011 I arrived full of enthusiasm with husband Walkabout Roo. Sadly I ripped a calf muscle and at Pearisburg we knew the end had come for us. We had insufficient time on our Visa to allow it to heal. A doctors visit in Harpers Ferry confirmed the damage, and the unlikelihood of being able to continue in 2011. We returned to Tassi, Australia, filled our heart and home with four legged friends in the shape of 2 Beagles, 2 Burmese and 2 Maine Coons, but the dream is still alive and well for me.Walkabout Roo doesn't want to hike anymore, the rocks did his head in.....so he will stay home and care for our babies, and as soon as I retire in 2016 I will be booking my airfare to start all over again at Springer Mountain in March 2017.I will also get by spinal surgery sorted out in the next year to give that time to heal.AT here I come, old, crotchety, but full of enthusiasm and wild dreams.","

Taz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/417803,"I have to get my head around the American way of putting the month first and then the date, in Australia we do it the other way around.
When we were planning our hike for 2011, I started in late 2009 and the time flew buy, but this time it is 4 years till my date......sigh.....such a long time to wait. Maybe we will get rich and I can go sooner.",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Sun",
Taz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/433174,"Looking at all of my equipment that we used on the AT, when much of it was changed to lighterweight as we hiked along. I realise everything is for two, and this time it will be just one! So first thing I am scratching about is tent. We loved our tent but I am leaning towards one that uses hiker poles to cut down some weight. Stove is a ponder too, I like my coffee QUICK when I get to camp, hence the jet boil, so I will have to get a single one. I am sure in the next three years even lighter equipment will appear so I won't make a mad rush to the shops yet. Loved my kilt and will probably go with that again. Loved the freedom when stepping over logs and the like, cool breeze on a hot day and a pair of thermals under it on the cold days worked great for me.","
