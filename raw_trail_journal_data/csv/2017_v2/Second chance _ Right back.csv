At that time I didn't know that there will be the same for us, our plan was going to Kid Gore Shelter. But when we came down to VT 9 we went down stone stairs it was damp and slippery I slipped and fell and hurt my ribs. It hurt so much that I couldn't breathe properly, we took a break when we had cross the street. As we were ready to go again I wanted to close my backpack but it hurts to much so I left it open. But can't go on like this, we tried to call someone to give us a ride to Bennington but we had no signal. So we walked down the street as a Lady stopped and asked if she could help us. We explained her that we want to go to Bennington for 1 or 2 days and she drove us, she was a triple crowner she has made all the 3 big trails  the AT,PCT and CDT congratulations and thank you for the ride. We went to a Restaurant in town for lunch and later we tried to find a Hotel, as we came to the Visitor Center we went in and they helped us finding a Hotel and gave us a ride .","Seth Warner Shelter
