Tomorrow, LeAnna and I fly to Atlanta, GA where we'll meet my old college roommate, Steve. From there, we'll grab a rental car and head to Amicalola Fall State Park where we have a couple rooms at the Lodge. After check-in, we plan on hiking down to the visitors center at the base of the falls to register and then back to the lodge to relax. 2/23, Steve and I will say our good byes to LeAnna and start up the Springer Mountain approach trail. Let the adventure begin!!!","

After checking into the lodge, we hiked down the 600+ stairs to the visitors center at the base of the falls. I registered with the thru-hiker log and I'm number 163 this year. I feel kind of guilty since, most likely, I'll be stopping at Harpers Ferry. That officially makes me a section hiker.Tomorrow we depart for Springer Mountain and this hike starts to get real.","Home

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555085,"This morning, after breakfast at the lodge (biscuits with cream of mushroom soup, yum!), we said our good byes to LeAnna and started up the approach trail to Springer Mountain. It was a tough eight mile climb with not a lot of water, but the day was absolutely gorgeous and the hike very enjoyable. When we arrive at Springer Mountain we had it to ourselves. We signed the log and filled our water bottles and then followed the first white blazes to Stover Creek shelter a few miles north. We're starting to see more and more thru hikers and getting all their stories. So far, an amazing trip!","Amicalola Lodge

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555086,Today represented our first full official day on the Appalachian Trail. We broke camp at Stover Creek Shelter and headed north. The weather was pretty much perfect today which we'll miss as it looks like rain everyday for the foreseeable future.The trail was gorgeous but we felt a little sore from yesterday's ascent up the approach trai. We decided to push on past our original camp spot at Justus Creek to Gooch Mountain Shelter. Lots of nice folks here. Steve and I are exhausted and very sore.

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555150,"After a late start, we departed Gooch Mountain Shelter and headed north. The thunder storm that came through in the night had abated and the rest of the day was perfectly cool and sunny. Some of the hikers at the shelter were aiming for Neels Gap, fifteen and some miles to the north. But based on our soreness and fatigue, we thought sticking to our original plan and stopping a few miles shy would be more prudent. The hike today was not as strenuous as yesterday (or we were getting our trail legs) and it took us past some breath taking views on Ramrock Mountain and Preaching Rock. There were lots of folks out given it was a gorgeous Saturday. As we neared our destination, we felt like we could push the final few miles to Neels Gap while we enjoyed the lovely evening. We accented Blood Mountain amongst the hordes of day and overnight hikers and descended into Neels Gap. There were no cabins available but they let us pitch our tents behind the store. Tomorrow we plan to take a zero, resupply, and get a cabin for the night. It is supposed to get down below freezing tonight. Looking forward to that cabin.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555177,"We're enjoying a nice zero day at Neels Gap after a very chilly night tenting behind Mountain Crossings outfitter. The freezing temperatures were actually a good test for my cold weather gear. It's good to know it'll keep me warm through the night when I get to the higher elevations in the Smokies. I had to sleep with my water filter and phone in my pocket.Steve and I checked into the Rabbit cabin here at Blood Mountain Cabins. We ordered a pizza and changed into our rain gear while they did our laundry. We'll head back up to Mountain Crossings for our resupply this afternoon. Tent and other gear are drying out on the deck.We made a reservation for a couple bunks at the Top of Georgia Hostel near Dicks Creek Gap 38 miles from here for Wed, March 1st. That'll give us a few days to navigate some big elevation gains and forecasted rain storms.My body feels pretty good. My knees are a bit sore but I can feel my legs getting stronger and the pounds melting away. I know we've had the benefit of good weather these past few days and more challenging times and fatigue are sure to come. Right now, I'm ready for whatever comes my way. This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be.","Neels Gap

The trail was quiet as compared to the earlier section during the weekend.We passed over Levelland Mountain with some great views. The rest of the day was the normal ups and downs. We packed out some sandwiches and enjoyed them with a view on Wildcat Mountain.After lunch, it began to get cold and it rained/sleeted until we arrived at Low Gap Shelter. We decided to stay here for the night since the next one isn't for another 7 miles.","Neels Gap

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555344,"The weather this morning was a bit chilly and foggy but it shaped up to be a beautiful day...until about 3pm when the sky opened up and it began to thunder and lightning. We had made it to Unicoi Gap, about half way through our day. We still had Rocky and Tray Mountains ahead of us with over 3,500 feet of climbing/descending to go to Tray Mountain Shelter. With the forecast calling for storms through Wednesday night, we decided to seek shelter in town.We stuck out our thumbs and soon caught a ride from a nice guy in a pick up truck. He deposited our tired selves at the Holiday Inn Express in Hiawassee, about 12 miles down the road. After watching the downpour and lightning from the comfort of our hotel room, we visited the buffet next door. Deep fried pork chops--yum!
We met our first Ridge Runner today. He was one of five in Georgia recently deployed for the 2017 hiking season. He was working around the Blue Mountain Shelter where we stopped for lunch.. We also met a couple really nice but lost hound dogs on the trail. It looked like they had been out in the woods on their own for a few days--very hungry and tired. They followed us for a couple miles until we ran into the Ridge Runner who helped to get them off the mountain and back to their owners.","Low. Gap Shelter

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555412,"After pondering the forecast for more storms, Steve and I decided to take the risk and attempt the 16.7 mile hike from Unicoi Gap to Dicks Creek Gap. I called the Top of Georgia Hostel where we had reservations for that evening and they were willing to give us a ride back to the trail. We were picked up by the Hostel owner, Sir Packs-a-lot, and soon we were on our way. We didn't start hiking until 10am so we knew it would be an adventure with the approaching storm. Our night in the hotel and a big dinner and breakfast helped power our way over Rocky and Tray Mountains. We had also left some of our gear back at the hotel, so we felt pretty good and were able to move smartly down the trail. It turned out to be a great day of hiking with serious miles for us newbies, despite the torrential thunder storm near the end. After arriving in Dicks Creek Gap, we got a ride back to the Holiday Inn. I called the Top of Georgia Hostel and asked them to give my two reserved bunks to other hikers as trail magic.","Unicoi Gap

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562872,"After departing the AT just a few miles shy of the Georgia/North Carolina border, I took care of a bunch of grown up stuff like finishing my job interviews and negotiating an offer.  I also closed out a lot of my AF retirement actions and tried to get the house and lawn ship shape for spring and summer.  Lastly, I was able to do some hiking with my son, share a trip to Paris with my daughter, and spend time with my wife.  
It's been a great March and April but it's time to challenge myself with some trail miles before I run out of terminal leave.  Today, I'm on my way to Erwin, Tennessee, where Uncle Johnny's Hostel will pick me up from the airport and put me up in a cabin for the night.  Tomorrow, I'll head north, making my way to Virginia, about 125 miles away.  
This should prove to be an amazing section of trail.  Severe thunderstorms and cooler temps are in the forecast so I'm ready to strap myself into another grand adventure.  Wish me luck.",,"Erwin, Tennessee ","May 03, Wed",0
Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563529,"I made it to Uncle Johnny's Hostel in Erwin last night.  After purchasing fuel for my stove, insect repellent, and a small knife (TSA no no's), I checked into my cabin which was way to big for me.  It was very rustic but I enjoyed the shower and the microwave.  It was nice to meet the Hostel owners, Johnny and Charlotte, who had been there for twenty years.  
This morning, I got an early start as us old guys usually do.  The morning was beautiful but the wind started picking up.  The wind reached crescendo as the day went on, with the canopy screaming like a freight train and the clouds sprinting across the ridge tops.  The occasional crack and thud from blow downs did not make me feel good.
The trail climbed out of Erwin across some streams and eventually to Beauty Spot, a large bald with 360 degree views of the mountains.  When I crossed, the wind was rushing 30-40 mph plus, maybe more, and I began to grow concerned.  What had I gotten myself into?
My planned camp site wasn't too much further.  I arrived around 1pm-- way too early!  I thought about pushing on a few more miles.  My shuttle driver had recommended camping in the dense spruce forest on the peak of Unaka Mountain, just a few miles ahead.  However, the camp I was at had some protection on the lee side of the ridge.  It's right by a forest service road which I hear is popular with local rebel rousers, but I'm hoping the weather keeps them home tonight.
So for now, I'm going to hunker down and hope this severe wind and rain moves through the area.  I'm expecting a hike in the wind and rain tomorrow.  Should be fun.","Erwin, Tennessee 
",Camp by USFS 230,"May 04, Thu",12.30
Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563530,"Today was a tough day.  I think I may be pushing the miles too much.  And this severe weather doesn't help.  The hills were tough but I got through them.  I'll find out if I'm going too hard as I push even more miles the next couple days.
The rain broke this morning slightly after sunrise.  I had beautiful weather during the morning as I climbed Unaka Mountain.  Unaka was covered by a thick spruce forest.  Green moss covered the rocks and trees.  It was like something out of a fairy tale.  
The rest of the day took me over rolling mountains, some of them quite taxing for someone like me just starting out again.  The rain came around 1pm as I approached a turn off for a hostel.  While I was very tempted, I pressed on to the shelter I had originally planned to stay.  There's two other guys here right now (Trailmix and Jacket) and I expect more will join us as we get into evening.
As an aside, at around 9pm last night, Miss Janet, an infamous trail angel in these parts, pulled up to my campsite and asked me if I wanted a ride into town.  She mentioned  forecasts for 80 mph winds.  As you know, I decided to stick it out on the mountain.  My tent had decent shelter from the wind and I didn't want to get behind in my schedule on my first night.  I may have to rethink things, however.  They predict snow on Roan Mountain which I'll attempt to summit tomorrow.  I heard they closed Great Smokey Mountain National Park because of the storms as well.  
Let the adventure continue!","Camp by USFS 230
",Clyde Smith Shelter,"May 05, Fri",13.90
Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563534,"Today was a grand adventure.  The shelter I stayed at last night only had three other guys in it (Steam, Jacket & Trailmix).  They were surprised there weren't more folks but I think the severe weather and the hostel a couple miles back had something to do with that.
I got an early start as the last forecast I had seen showed some bad weather arriving early afternoon and I had some major elevation (Roan Mountain) to traverse.  A few miles in, I was treated to some trail magic courtesy of Lawndart at Hugh Gap.  Eventually, I made it up Roan Mountain which was covered with snow and ice from  last night.  It was absolutely beautiful, the snow hanging on the grass and tree branches.  
After Roan Mountain, I crossed a few magnificent balds and the weather occasionally broke to offer some views.  After 15 and some miles, I made it to Overmountain Shelter which is a converted barn.  I have my bed laid out in the loft.  Jacket and Trailmix are here along with about a dozen other hikers.  
Some students and their professors are also here at the shelter.  They are from the Savanna School of Art and Design and they are preparing a fancy meal for us as part of a school project looking at contrasting formal dining with the extremes of the outdoors.  The white table clothes and bow ties definitely seem like art out here miles from nowhere.
Overall, an amazing day and it keeps getting better.","Clyde Smith Shelter
",Overmountain Shelter,"May 06, Sat",15.60
Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563535,"Today was an exhausting yet exhilarating day.  I woke early in the barn and was on the trail by 7am.  Overmountain shelter is at almost 5,000 feet and it was COLD last night.  I didn't get much sleep.  I had two major peaks to cross today and 18 miles to my next camp.  Most of the other hikers were stopping at the Hostel 10 miles into the day.  Why do I keep doing this to myself?
The first section of the trail was up to the summit of of Little Hump Mountain, a spectacular bald with views back to the Overmountain shelter.  It was cold and icy up top but magnificent.  I then took a slight dip down into a gap then up to Hump Mountain, an even more amazing bald.  The sky had opened up and I could see for miles in every direction.  
Then the trail took me down, down, down for about six miles to the road to Elk and Roan Mountain, TN.  I took a slight detour to the Hostel I mentioned before but it's general store was closed.  I was hoping to get some Gatorade and some fruit.  
So I returned to the trail and headed onward on my last eight miles and I was exhausted.  However the terrain is starting to be less steep.  Still very hilly, mind you; just not as extreme as the morning.  After passing Jones Falls and the Elk River (looked very suitable for a paddle), I arrived at Mountaineer Falls where I have made camp.  I'm a couple thousand feet lower than last night and the weather has taken a turn for the better so I'm looking forward to not shivering the night away.  I found an excellent campsite and met some new friends camped across the way--Legion,Sweets, and Belle (dog).
I feel good and I'm ready for a nice, 16 mile hike tomorrow to the Black Bear Resort.  I have a ""rustic"" cabin reserved and a hot shower waiting for me.  I'm very ready for that!","Overmountain Shelter

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563698,"Today was a gorgeous day and the weather was perfect.  However, I could feel the miles starting to catch up with me.  I rose early, broke camp, and was on the trail by 7am.  Jacket and Mercury soon caught up to me.  They had stayed at the shelter just on the other side of the falls.  They were pressing on to Laurel Fork Shelter which was a couple miles further than I was going. They then aimed to capture Damascus by Wed by hiking 20+ miles the following two days.  Me?  I was on my way to the Black Bear Resort just 16 miles away and there's nothing that could shake me from the realization that was where I needed to go.
The trail gently rolled through the Tennessee Appalachians filled with rhododendron and cascading streams.  The hike was very pleasant but some of those hills kept going up and up and up.  My feet were really starting to hurt and I hoped I wasn't courting an injury.  I passed the renown trail-side bench at mile marker 405.8 offering views of Little Hump and Hump Mountains in the distance.  Hard to believe I had hiked over those way off peaks just yesterday.  I also saw some more waterfalls and met some more hikers, Easy Going and McCain. 
Finally, I arrived at Dennis Cover Road and hiked almost a mile down the road to the resort.  I have a rustic cabin which I will enjoy tonight.  The shower and laundered hiking clothes feel fantastic.  I definitely needed that.  As I was struggling over my need to take a zero day to recover and my desire to get to Damascus by Thursday, an opportunity presented itself.  A fellow hiker, Mystic, is staying in a cabin next to mine.  She asked if I wanted to share a shuttle about 13 miles down the trail and slack pack back to the Black Bear Resort.  We'll then take another shuttle back to where were originally dropped off on Wednesday and continue on towards Damascus.  It took me a half a second to accept.  This will add about 5 miles to my Wed and Thurs hikes but gives me an easy day tomorrow to recover.  I think this will work.  I'll also get to enjoy another evening with a bed, shower, and pizza and beer on Tuesday.  Oh yah!","Mountaineer Falls Campsite

This morning at 8am, one of the owners of Black Bear Resort (Bob) shuttled Mystic and I 13 miles north on the trail.  We then started southbound back to the resort, with considerably lightened packs (no tents, sleeping bags, etc.).  Mystic and I immediately split up as my pace was faster and I enjoyed a day untainted with the drive to make miles or the worry of finding a place to sleep tonight.  I made my way through the woods, fresh from a recent rain shower, down to Watauga Dam.  One of the neat things about going southbound today was that I was able to cross paths with a lot of the folks I've been hiking with since Erwin.  First I met Trailmix who I hadn't seen since Overmountain Shelter.  Trailmix was also slackpacking but going northbound, and trying to hike 45+ miles in one day to Damascus!  There was no time for chit chat with Trailmix as he had a mission to complete.  I then ran into Jacket and Mercury who I've been with the last three nights before I diverted to Black Bear.  They had stayed in a shelter a couple miles further and were now driving to be in Damascus by Wednesday.  They have a big hiking day tomorrow.  I then saw McCain, Garret, and then Jukebox (from Switzerland).  I hadn't seen Jukebox since Overmountain Shelter as well and he was pushing the miles to catch up due to his diversion to the hostel in Roan Mountain.  He hiked 10 miles that day I hiked 18 and he was now paying for it.  He looked totally exhausted.  Perhaps I'll catch up with him tomorrow.  I also saw Steam who zeroed at Black Bear today after hiking 25 miles yesterday.
At the Watauga Lake recreation center, I found I had excellent cell reception.  I took the opportunity to catch up with the family on FaceTime.  I then started my 2,000 foot climb and  decent over an unnamed mountain.  That one just kept going and going.  However, with my light pack and liberal timeline, I just took my time and enjoyed the views.  I then hiked by Laurel Falls which were absolutely spectacular.  Google these falls if you've never heard of them.  I was amazed and enjoyed the roar of the water while I ate my lunch.
After a short climb out of the Laurel Fork gorge, I made it back to Black Bear, showered and grabbed some food.  I met some new hikers: Little Veggie, Ziplock, Hot Sauce, and Twelve Pack.  I'm also looking at maybe going out to dinner with Mystic, No Worries, and Three Socks this evening.  Tomorrow and Thursday, I'm going to attempt to hike 20 miles a day and arrive in Damascus Thursday afternoon.  With fresh-ish legs, clear skies, and flatter terrain, I'm hoping it all works out.","Wilber Dam Road

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564155,"I'm camping by Double Springs Shelter tonight.  There's only one other guy here, another ""Mystic"", and he's in the shelter.  A few folks have passed through, anxious to get a little bit closer to Damascus.
We got another late start today as the other Mystic and I were dropped off by Bob again at Wilber Dam Road.  However, this time, we hiked north and with full packs.  I left Mystic after the first switch back and pushed on to capture 19, or half, the miles left to Damascus.  The trail had some ups in the beginning but gradually became more gentle, more or less following a ridge.  I was mostly in the woods or on the ridge top with a short section going through some pastures with some nice views.  It took me all day and my feet now have blisters, but I made it the 19 miles.  Tomorrow's 19 miles should be easier as there's more downhills and I'll be getting an early start to enjoy the cooler weather.
Other than the people at or passing by the shelter, I only saw two other hikers on the trail today.  It was definitely a day of solitude.  I listened to my headphones while hiking for the first time this trip.  I'm looking forward to getting into town tomorrow.
Quick add: since writing this, a back country trail angle named Blood Hound visited our shelter with gifts of iced PBR and Little Debbie's.  Magic just when I needed it!  This trail is a special place.","Wilber Dam Road

Hayduke ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564158,"This morning, I woke before dawn and broke camp.  I was hiking while munching on my breakfast pop tart by 6am.  The trail continued its gentle grade with easy ups and downs and the occasional flats.  The weather was sunny with a slight breeze.  The day had all the makings of a perfect hiking day but my dogs were already barking into the first of my 19 miles today.  I added some moleskin and popped a couple Advil and hoped for the best.  
The miles started melting away and I occupied myself with some tunes and a text conversation with my wife.  The conversation eventually led to, ""Are you working the next couple days?"".  While I'm sure a zero in Damascus, some good food and a shower would've help power my next section of trail, my inner voice was telling me this would be a great place to bookend the adventure.  
While pondering the options, I crept up on the TN-VA state line, 16 miles into my hike.  A few miles later, I found myself on the outskirts of Damascus hobbling through the famous welcome sign.  I checked into the Dancing Bear B&B and ordered up some shrimp and grits at Mojo's Cafe.  There's a big storm coming in tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about my plans right now.
I haven't yet seen any one I know in town but Maple Leaf and Yankee.  I hope to run into a few more folks tonight.  I'm not sure if there's a pub in town but I'm going to have a look.  Mostly, I'm looking forward to seeing my love tomorrow.","Double Springs Shelter

This morning I enjoyed an amazing breakfast of French Toast casserole, courtesy of Melisa here at the Dancing Bear.  And the coffee...good Lord...that hit the spot.  That's one of the many gifts the trail offers--a heightened appreciation for those little things in life.  
I took a hike along the AT a couple miles north of town so I could pass the thru-hikers heading out on my way back.  The only ones I knew were Garret and Pace.  I've seen Garret just about every day of my hike, although we've never camped in the same spot.  He said he had sore feet from some blisters gained during the last day or two.  I hear you brother!  Perhaps Garret and I would've matched pace for a while had I continued.  Garret is one of those AT hikers I really admire because he seems to be hiking on the cheap; staying in the woods most nights and making due on gear.  Garret has two wooden sticks for hiking poles.  That's hard core and very cool in my opinion.
As I thought about the aspects I liked most about the trail this past week, here's what I came up with:

I like the highlands and traversing the peaks and balds; the air is cooler, the vegetation more interesting, insects are absent, and you get to play chess with the weather
I like pushing my mind, spirit, and body in ways I just can't back home.  I love pushing through the exhaustion and feeling my muscles get stronger and the pounds melt away.
I like meeting and mixing with other hikers.  I enjoyed the solitude at times but was always glad to find company along the trail, especially in camp.  There is a certain caliber of people out here I don't usually get to mix with.
I like the unexpected surprises like trail magic or that amazing camp site/view or an incredibly convenient water source.  These things abound on the AT.
I like living simply, worrying only about water, negotiating the trail, etc.

Conversely, here's a short list of things I won't miss:

Hiking at lower elevations with the think vegetation, bugs, and humidity; hiking down steep hills (hard on the knees)
Blisters, sore knees, chafed thighs, being hot when it comes time to sleep
Long periods of solitude / boredom; this is an area I probably need to work on; I should seek stillness more and learn how to better quiet my mind

Thanks for following me on my hike.  Not sure if I'll be back on the trail this year.  I'll let you know.","
