High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569331,"Hmmm.  This spring wasn't exactly my finest hour!  It consisted primarily of a series of fits and starts, dubious decisions and self-inflicted fiascoes.  So, um, here's to summer!!
Thus far on the AT this year I have hiked only 273.4 miles, from Springer Mountain to Hot Springs, NC.  So at this late date any realistic hope of completing a thru-hike will mean that at some point I will have to flip-flop up to Katahdin and hike southbound.  That's not exactly the end of the world, of course -- in fact it sounds like great fun to me.  But I will defer that decision until a later date.  What I really need to do now is to get back to hiking and to stay focused on hiking!","Springer Mountain

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569449,"Here I go again, on my own.  Ha!!  Actually I'm heading back to the trail with great assistance from my best friend Tara, the good folks at Greyhound and my cousin Marti and her husband Chris.  I can't remember the last time I did anything worthwhile on my own.  Most likely, I never did.  So here's to friends, family and still-relatively-cheap-if-not-all-that-rapid-or-direct-or-efficient public transportation! Overnight tonight a series of no fewer than four (count 'em, four!) buses will zigzag me down to Asheville, NC, and from there either Marti or Chris will ferry me back to Hot Springs.  I hope to be back on trail by late tomorrow morning.  Right, um, after having breakfast at the Great Smoky Mountain Diner, of course.","Hot Springs, NC

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579261,"Oh my.  What a phantom journal this turned out to be!  Apologies to all for my undeniable selfishness.  The hiking, the trail, the hiking partners, the hostels ... all were wonderful.  I had a grand time.  Sorry I didn't write about it.  I was very much caught up in the moment.
This year I hiked 516.3 miles on the AT, from Springer Mountain to Dickey Gap in Southwestern Virginia.  I left the trail on July 5 to attend a family reunion, and I did not return.  I'm okay with that.  The AT is incomparable, but for me the second time around just wasn't the same.  Personally, I think I have a need to experience new adventures and new challenges, on different trails.  
So, on October 4, I began an attempt at a SOBO thru-hike of the Benton MacKaye Trail.  This trail is positively lonesome compared to the AT!  There's virtually no one out here but me.  Which means, there's plenty of time for reflection and journaling, even for a terribly undisciplined writer.
Please come on over to my BMT journal if you wanna.  I'll do my best to stay focused on the journaling as well as the hiking.  
And to everyone I met on the AT this year:  I'm glad we crossed paths.  You made my life better.  Thank you.","Hot Springs, NC
