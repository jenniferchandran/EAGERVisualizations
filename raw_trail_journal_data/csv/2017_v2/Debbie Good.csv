Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482844,I have already been working toward a thru hike for the last year and a half or so and have two more years to go. I needed to wait until my daughter is older because she doesn't want to go with me and she will need to be more independent when I go.Lately I am driving myself crazy trying to figure my gear. I need to try to stop obsessing about it and start working out my food. I have dietary issues that won't allow me to function on the typical thru hiker food. Fortunately there are many new alternatives available these days. I do have to say though that the backpacking gear available now is so amazing to me compared to what I started out with in the 1990's. I really enjoy not having to carry 50 - 60 pounds on my back!As I get my gear finalized I will write about my choices.,,View Entry,"Mar 05, Thu",0
Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483920,"Thru hiking the Appalachian Trail is a challenge all on its own but I get to have the added challenge of hiking with fibromyalgia. I was diagnosed in 2007 and at that point I wasn't really hiking anymore. I got to the point where I had to quit working entirely because I was feeling so bad all the time. This was really difficult for me having a degree in Outdoor Recreation and being an active, outdoorsy woman. I went through the standard medical protocol for fibro and all the pharmaceuticals either didn't work or made me a zombie. My husband's co-worker recommended a local naturopath and so I went to see her not expecting anything. Now Dr. Molly Force is one of my heroes. After seeing her for about a year I started feeling good enough to get back out hiking. Then my friend Kelly started going hiking with me every week. We started out slow and not too far and each week we went a little farther and did more elevation gain. After realizing that I can hike at my own pace and get some real miles in I started to think about this old dream of mine. I have wanted to hike the AT since I was in my 20's. I will be 49 when I attempt my hike...turning 50 the November after. I thought it would be a cool way to welcome in 50!I'm sure there will be many who doubt my ability to do this and that's okay. I know I will have really tough days and I can deal with those in the woods just as easily as at home.",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Mon",0
Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484884,"My daughter has off of school for two weeks so we are driving to Redwoods National Park. We have never been and I am really excited to hike amongst the giant trees! Plus I am just excited to hike since we have been driving the last couple of days.It's been pouring rain a lot since we left. Hopefully we will have some decent days in the trees. I have been experimenting with gear and clothing the last year or so. I am still not sure which tent I will take but I love my Enlightened Equipment 850 fill down tek quilt with a 10 degree rating. It's warm, light, and doesn't make me feel confined. Plus it weighs just 21.67 ounces ...wow! I have also decided on the Thermarest Neo Air Xtherm with the 5.7 R value. I sleep chilly and this pad makes a huge difference for me and it only weighs 15 ounces.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Mon",0
Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/485467,"My family and I are just finishing up our road trip to Redwoods National Park. We did a combination of camping and hotelling. We were able to see and do quite a lot during our trip. We drove down the coast which was beautiful and slow. We took an elevator down to see hundreds of sea lions in a huge sea cave. The people are kept separate from the sea lions thankfully. Then there were all the sea stacks in the ocean. And those redwoods...holy cow! Yesterday we woke up in our tent at Redwoods, packed up our camp, took a scenic drive, rode a gondola through the trees, drove a short ways up the coast, turned inland and up to Crater Lake, took a short walk in the snow, had a snowball fight, took pictures, drove and drove and drove through really the middle of nowhere, finally got to a town and got a hotel room. Whew! Today was the High Desert Museum, a drive around Mt. Hood and a nice hotel.We have enjoyed the beautiful, warm weather this trip. It helps with the fibro and with the attitude!",,Spring Break,"Mar 28, Sat",0
Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/488003,"I have a heck of a time getting shoes to fit my wide feet. I used to wear Merrell everything but then they changed their shoes and boots so they are narrower and that didn't work for me. So now I'm a Keen fan and have been wearing their sandals, mary janes and hiking boots for the last couple of years. Unfortunately Keen discontinued my hiking boots which I still love but can't fit into anymore because my feet have gotten longer in the past two years of hiking. But instead of going to REI and trying on all their Keens I was lured into ordering online a pair of La Sportivas that Backpacker reviewed so highly. They sounded so perfect but I should have known better. The La Sportivas were like walking on a cloud, a cloud that is jacked up higher in the back and narrow in the toes. In the house they felt fine but when I tried them on trail my knees hurt for the first time in years and my toes were smushed together. And my back started to hurt too. I don't know what they were thinking making the shoes so that you are on a continual slant forward. Fortunately REI rocks and I was able to return the boots and get a pair of Keen boots like I should have done in the first place. I don't remember the model off hand but they are light with ankle support. And I love them. I will get a pair of Superfeet inserts because the Keen insert doesn't work with my arch.","

Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/492550,"The Pacific Northwest is having some unusually warm and sunny weather, making it difficult to stay inside lately. Yay! But since it's chilly out today, just got a fire going in the woodstove, I thought I'd get back on here again! I am hiking twice a week with a great group of women and we're starting to get out into the National Forest and Park to do more challenging hikes. Last Thursday was the first really big hike of the season up Mount Townsend in Olympic National Forest. It's about 8.5 miles round trip with an elevation gain of 2600 feet. Unfortunately, it was the one foggy day of the week so we didn't have the spectacular views, however it was still a great hike. The trees are mystical looking in the fog and the hike is still a great work out! And we did get to see a mountain lion track right next to some mountain goat tracks. I'm working on plans for some backpacking trips this summer. I'm excited to try out my new sleep system somewhere other than my back yard. And I just bought my tent! I have been trying out all kinds of tents and finally decided on the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1. I just slept out in it last night and it seems plenty roomy enough for me. I love how easy it is to set up which will be a plus when I'm tired at the end of a challenging day. Plus you can set up the fly and footprint first and then put the tent up, keeping it dry in the rain!","

Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496880,It seems I have five days available to me to go backpacking in June. Now I just need to make a plan and get my head wrapped around going alone. I have had many car camping experiences alone but only one backpacking trip last summer that was just an overnight. I realize I will be hiking alone a lot on the AT and I'm looking forward to it so now I just need to get more comfortable alone. Trying to decide on where I want to hike is harder than it should be. I tend to want to go back to the same places I've already been but there are so many other beautiful trails out here. I have decided on and purchased my tent. I bought the Big Agnes Copper Spur ul 1. It's not luxurious by any means but there is enough room to sit up and do downward dog so I'm happy. I also found out I have a week next June (2016) when I can fly out and hike on the AT for a shakedown cruise! Any other hiker chicks from the class of 2017 want to meet up and hike together?,,Summer planning,"May 26, Tue",0
Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500588,"This past weekend my family and I hiked into the Olympic National Forest for an overnight at a beautiful lake surrounded by rocky mountains. The weather out here in the Pacific Northwest has been unusually warm for this time of year. We usually call it June-uary because June is usually gray, wet, and cold. But this year we have been enjoying sunny and warm weather and have started thinking that we will stay warm all summer now. As soon as we stepped out of the car at the trailhead we realized that it was going to be a chilly night out if the clouds didn't move along. But the clouds decided to sit on top of the mountains all day making it cold. Then the clouds went away for the night which made it even colder! Fortunately we all have warm bags and slept well. My enlightened equipment down quilt is fantastic...love that thing! Fortunately my daughter didn't care one bit about the cold. She found three kids camping there and they all set out exploring the place, catching tadpoles, climbing a huge boulder, and just having a great time. The kids didn't even need coats, they were toasty from all the running around. My husband and daughter hadn't been to that lake before and really enjoyed it. We were at Silver Lake behind Mount Townsend. Most people hike in through the Mt. Townsend trail which is a nice, smooth path but about twice as long in as the way trail we took in. The way trail follows the creek for a little over two miles before you connect to the main trail. The way trail is steep and has a lot of rocks and roots to contend with. When I hiked it with my friend Kelly a couple of years ago it was raining and this trail was trecherous! It's a beautiful hike in along the creek and you're not in the hot sun should it be a sunny day and you don't see many people where the Mt. Townsend trail is like a highway on the weekends. It was a great family weekend. Just makes me love hiking more. Our next adventure is a bathroom remodel! I'm in the process of undecorating the bathroom today. We are going to start tearing things out and the remodeling begins within a week! Happy to say goodbye to harvest gold shower, sink and tub...the 70's weren't pretty!",,Family Backpack Trip,"Jun 15, Mon",0
Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518765,"I haven't written in here in a long while. I have had a tough year with lots of fibro flares but I am still hiking and preparing for 2017! I have joined our local gym so that I can get stronger for my hike. And I am really excited that Anish, who just broke the unsupported thru hike record this year on the AT and is a personal trainer, is going to work with me for the next six months. I feel like I need to be as physically fit as possible before I start. I have been planning this hike for a couple of years now and I want to do whatever I can to increase the odds of finishing. My daughter is starting to get a little freaked out about me going. She had been really supportive before but as we get closer it's becoming more real for her. So we chatted about it more and I told her I need to at least start the trail and if it becomes too difficult for her to have me gone then I will come back and become a section hiker. I think once I go she will really enjoy being more independent. And I have some awesome friends who will be her emotional support while I'm gone. Plus she will have a cell phone so we can talk and facetime as much as possible.",,Still here!,"Dec 26, Sat",0
Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518926,"I hope everyone had a fun and safe New Year's eve. We have friends over for cribbage every year possible. So far we missed two, once when we went to New Zealand and once when I had an emergency appendectomy...wheee!!!! My hubby and I started the new year with a lovely hike from our front door. We walk to the end of the road and head down jnto the wooded trails, through a rural neighborhood, to the beach and through a cool, old fort. 7.6 miles is a good start to the year. We returned from the east coast where it was warm and rainy to frosty cold and clear weather here, both of which I have been enjoying. It's amazing to me how much hiking really helps me feel better. Fibromyalgia brings along all sorts of symptoms besides the pain and fatigue. Hiking helps to alleviate my pain, depression, and anxiety. And I just love hiking so much. I tend to have a perma-grin on when I'm out in the Olympics hiking. I am so lucky to live so close to great hiking and to have a great hiking partner. Kelly and I started out with slow and short hikes to last summer day hiking to Royal Basin, a 14 mile hike. She has been a great motivator for me and she is always such a positive, supportive person. Thank you Kelly!",,Happy New Year!,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Debbie Good,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520310,I have been working out with the guidance of Anish aka Heather Anderson for the past month now. I am feeling so much stronger already and my energy has been really good a lot more often. I still have fibro flares but they are shorter in duration and the exercise seems to help. I am in shock really at how great the working out has been. I never thought I would be where I am now. A few years ago I was on the couch most of the day. It is hard to wrap my mind around the fact that I am not on the couch much anymore. Part of the reason I am hiking the AT next year is to flip the bird to fibromyalgia. I'm taking back my life.,,Working Out,"Jan 27, Wed",0
