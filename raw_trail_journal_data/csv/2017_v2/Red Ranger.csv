Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555327,Dropped off at the parking lot on FS 42 about 6:00 and made it to the shelter area at sunset. Found a tent site before dark but had to put on my headlight to set up. Saw two campfires in the tent area. Did not go down to the shelter so I don't know how many people were there.,,Springer Mtn,"Feb 23, Thu",0
Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555329,"Went up to the top of the mtn for a starting picture. Unfortunately it was very foggy and I was having to use the timer so the picture isn't great. Sunny day. Saw maybe a half dozen other hikers. Got to the shelter without any problems, four tents and four people in the shelter. Dark and quiet by 6:45. Some time later I woke to noise and flashlights. I was camped down the hill from the shelter and a bunch of people came down close by and started setting up. Sounded like kids, maybe four. Talking constantly as they set up. Seemed to go on for at least an hour. I never look at my watch at night, don't want to know how much time I have left to sleep. They opened the metal bear box, used for food storage, which had loud hinges, at least three times. Later during the night there was a thunder storm which required them to get up again, talk, shine flashlights, and open the bear box two more times.","Springer Mtn

Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555331,"Warm and sunny. It's Saturday, good weather, on what is probably the most heavily used section of the trail, Woody Gap to Neels Gap. I saw at least 100 hikers, almost all day hikers, and at least 50 dogs. Got down to the Gap about 4:00. Luckily I had made a reservation and Blood Mtn Cabins because there was only one bed left at the hostel, not that I stay in hostels if there is any way to avoid it.","Gooch Mtn Shelter

A couple dozen day hikers, kids and adults south bound from Low Gap shelter with giant packs. Eight people at the shelter for the night, I think all but one thru hikers. One a young woman from Germany.","Neels Gap
",Blue Mtn Shelter,"Feb 26, Sun",18.80
Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555333,"Easier walk this year than in 2010 when there was snow on the ground. Did not put on my gloves going up Tray Mtn when it started getting cold, they were buried deep in my pack, so my fingers froze up and I had a hard time getting things done when I ate lunch at Tray Mtn shelter. Took 15 minutes longer to eat than usual. Light rain for about 20 minutes in the afternoon. When I was almost to the Gap I saw a tent set up in the woods. It's not unusual for hikers to set up close to a road and catch a ride to town to buy supplies. That way they don't have to spend money for a place to stay in town. When I got to the Gap there was a guy sitting there. I asked if he had seen my wife's car and he said that she had just pulled out. I was about 20 minutes later than my estimated time so I thought she had gone to Top of Georgia hostel to see if I was there. No phone service but I could text and told her where I was. The more the guy talked, the more I thought he was not really a serious hiker. I guess I've spent a little over a year total hiking and you meet a lot of odd characters in that amount of time. There are homeless people in the woods just like in towns. Usually located in places where they can con or beg for food and handouts. A lot of hikers go to Hiawassee for rest and resupply so they might give any food they have left over to another hiker who appears down on his luck. I left a shelter once when I was by myself and walked on down the trail another mile or so to camp because one of these guys was there. My wife asked me about him as we were driving away and in spite of what I told her, felt sorry for him and wanted to go back to the hostel and pay for him to stay for a night. So we turned around and went back to the hostel. Turns out they were very familiar with him, had let him stay in the past and had to kick him out for causing trouble and he had been in legal trouble in Hiawassee. Heavy set with a beard if he is still there when you go by. Tent is set up to left of the trail a couple of hundred yards from the road. Going home to Rabun county for a day off. Be back on the trail Wednesday.","Blue Mtn Shelter

The forecast showers arrived after lunch. Off and on until about 4:30 when there was thunder and a hard wind. Got to the shelter after 5:00. It was crowded, wind was blowing rain in under the porch roof. I had to set my pack as a wind block to heat water for supper. Wind and rain slacked off after an hour or so.

This morning it was below freezing and combined with the rain yesterday, a good number may have already quit. It's hard to adjust pack straps that get wet from rain then freeze stiff. My shoes have fabric over the forefoot so at least I could walk in them without waiting for the leather to thaw. The drinking tube on my Camelback was frozen. It's been so long since i had done any cold weather hiking that I forgot about blowing the water back into the bladder after drinking. Nice day once the sun came up.

It used to not have a name. There are a lot of steep climbs. Is somebody going to name them all? Wife picked me up at the shelter, have some business at home tomorrow. Be back Wednesday. After a week and a half I have observed that there really are a lot more people on the trail a lot earlier than usual. And it seems that there are a lot more of older hikers than usual. It will be interesting to see how many stick it out. It's too early to think about who I'll be seeing on a regular basis. Lots of people will quit within the first couple of hundred miles and others are still establishing their walking pace.","Sassafras Gap Shelter
",Fontana Shelter,"Mar 05, Sun",21.90
Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556153,"My wife dropped me off at Fontana last night. The TVA, I guess, has removed some of the picnic tables close to the shelter so there is about a half dozen concrete pads to set tents on. Very warm day for hiking. Stopped at Mollies Ridge shelter for lunch. A strange guy was there that I heard later was another lost soul. Very tall, black jeans, black leather tennis shoes, a small purple Walmart-brand book bag,thin but bulky sleeping bag bungi-corded on top, two shirts rolled up and tied around his waist, and three or four plastic grocery bags with who knows what in them. The shelter is 9.9 miles from Fontana, which is a long way from help considering the weather expected in the next few days. One difference this year from 2010 is the proliferation of smart phones. I did not get one until 2011 and even now don't consult it before making every decision the way some do.As a result of this wealth of accessible information everybody seems to know everything about what's going on, particularly the weather. The topic of conversation at the shelter this evening was the snow forecast for Saturday night. And how bad it could be. There were seven of us in the shelter at sunset, and two more showed up later, one slept on the floor at the front of the shelterr and the other set up a hammock.","Fontana Shelter
",Derrick Knob Shelter,"Mar 09, Thu",23.40
Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556158,"A short thunder storm occurred during the night. The morning was overcast, foggy, with a very strong wind. I was thinking about the snow most of the day. In the early 2000's for four or five years in a row I went on the same hike the first or second week of December. Start at Fontana, first night at Mollies Ridge, second night at Derrick Knob, third night at Double Springs, then retrace my steps back to Fontana. It being between Thanksgiving and Christmas break I was usually by myself. One year on my way back south it started to snow during my second night at Derrick Knob, about 10 inches by morning. The snow was deep enough to interfere with walking and heavy enough to bend the mountain laurel and smaller trees down over the trail. I was a long ,hard climb up Thunderhead and I had trouble finding the trail southbound off Rocky Top. I normally got to Mollies Ridge well before dark but this time I was at Spence Field with about two hours of daylight left. I thought about stopping for the night and going down to the Lakeside trail the next day to get below the worst of the snow. But then I saw footprints going south, having come up to the AT from Cades Cove. I kept going to Russel Field shelter, although it wasn't easy. There were two other guys there. The trail goes through a large laurel grove southbound and it took a while to find the trail the next morning since the laurel was bent over. It was after sunset but still light enough to see when I got down to the paved road leading over the dam. About 2:30 today I met up with a Southbound hiker who looked experienced and stopped to talk. He had started hiking that day and said the latest forecast called for as much as a foot of snow Saturday night and Sunday. That was enough for me. As soon as I had service I called my wife and told her to come and get me. Everyone else I talked to was also getting off the trail at Newfound Gap. I would have still been above 4000 feet in the park Saturday night and there would have been no road to bail out on until Sunday at I40. If that was passable. Was going to come home Monday or Tuesday anyway to finish up taxes so I'll just get a few extra days off.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Almost no snow left but as a result of the thaw-freeze cycle there were sheets of ice in many places on the trail. Got to the shelter at 7:15, about 30 minutes before sunset.

Cool and foggy till about noon. No view from Max Patch. Very windy just like 2010 but I didn't make the same mistake I did then. I put my long underwear shirt on under my regular shirt and rain jacket. My fingers were still working when I got to Roaring Fork Shelter for lunch. Half way between Max Patch and the shelter I was passed by the younger of the two German (I think) guys. He was in a tee shirt, no hat, no gloves. He was at the shelter when I got there, when he left he had on a long sleeve shirt, stocking cap, and gloves. Afternoon was sunny, took my rain jacket off but kept long underwear shirt on. Gloves were off and on several times. Made good time for me, got to the shelter 15 minutes before I planned. The only people there were two German guys and a German woman I remember from Blue Mtn Shelter last month.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

As usual I'm at Springbrook cottages. Too expensive for most hikers. The owner had a record of my stays in 2008, 2010, and 2012. Check-in normally 2:00 but she let me have my key when I got there. By 12:30 I had had a couple of sausage biscuits and hashbrowns at the Smoky Mtn Diner, picked up my resupply box at the outfitters, washed clothes, taken a shower, and cleaned up most of my gear. Updated trail journal in the afternoon, then back to the diner for an early supper. I""ve seen a fair amount of hikers around town, but not as many as I thought would be here.","Deer Park Mtn Shelter

Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557463,"Full day off, beautiful weather. After lunch at the Diner stopped to talk with another hiker about my age also eating lunch. He said that the ""Walk in the Woods"" movie probably had something to do with the large number or older hikers on the trail this year. I don't know how many started, but I'm beginning to see a lot of the same guys over and over, so I guess they're hanging in there. Lighter gear and better information on how to prepare, along with the mental toughness that older people have gained after years of having to put up with bad situations that they could not control at home and at work. It's been my experience that the young people quit the trail for mental reasons, they can't handle the months of cold weather, hot weather, wet weather, monotonous food, bugs, dirt, obnoxious hikers, crowded hostels, etc. Older hikers quit because something physically breaks. As I mentioned, I'm beginning to see the same people every day or so. In 2010 by Damascus, VA I had met up with the group I would spend most of my time with the rest of the hike. I should be in Damascus in a little less than two weeks. Looking forward to how things will turn out.   ","Hot Springs, NC

Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558737,"Leaving town you cross the river, walk through the NOC property, then along the riverbank for a ways before turning up into the woods. The riverbank is the homeless and poor hiker campground. You're in the national forest but only about 10 minutes from town. There were 3 or 4 tents and about a dozen people just laying out on the ground. I usually stop at the first shelter, 10 miles out for lunch. When I got there there was a young woman there who didn't look like a regular hiker, tan Army boots, cotton pants and hooded sweatshirt,stuff layed out in the shelter in the middle of the day. Knowing that the water source was a long way down a hill, I didn't feel good about leaving my pack so I just kept walking. No other water for 2 hours until coming to a road and seeing a sign that said Mom's Store with an arrow. The store is a small block building,inside, half the space is a few shelves with snacks and a drink cooler. The other half is old furniture. I section hiked this area back in the mid-90's and Mom was in there running the place. It looked the same then as now. I have never seen it open since. Got two cokes and had my lunch. Met an older couple, the wife a retired school teacher, who knew about the young women and thought she was mentally challenged. A few hours later I came to a place where the trail had obviously been rerouted and was surprised to find that it was rerouted onto an old road instead of off of one.

I saw a car come through town this morning with snow on it. Got my replacement shoes that Nancy shipped up here yesterday and another shirt she shipped today. The old shoes were great shoes for me, I wore them for the last couple of hundred miles in 2012 plus some other short hikes so they had at least 300 miles before this trip. I can only remember one blister and that was due to my inattention. Some of the leather trim was splitting and the fabric was tearing and the Goretex was no longer working. Looks like it will be warming up and the replacement shirt is cooler. Went by Mount Rogers Outfitters to arrange my shuttle to HWY 600 in the morning and the manager offered to take me for nothing. I can not recommend them strongly enough. Great people who know how to provide great customer service.If you click on the stats box to the left, you will see only two zero days(days when no hiking is done). I don't see the need to take the time to post a lot of entries with nothing on them. But in case you're curious, here is what I usually do when in town. Usually in bed by 9:30 and up by 7:00 to stay close to my hiking schedule. I try to get into town early enough to get clothes washed, and gear cleaned that first day. That way on the next full day off I don't have anything I have to do. Eat, snack and rest on the full day off. I can afford to spend more time in town than the young kids and at my age want to try make sure I give my body enough time to recover from high mileage days. When I'm in the woods I'm walking all day. If I want to rest, I do it in town. Nancy commented on the lack of pictures. If you look at my other journals there are pictures in most of them.

I was able to take my long underwear and jacket off by 9:00. I was going to have lunch at the next shelter but it was a little ways off the trail so I decided to keep going to the next water source. About 20 minutes later I was climbing over a fence on a set of steps (instead of a gate that might be left open, fences usually have a set of steps or a ladder that goes up one side and down the other) when I saw a cardboard Coca Cola 12 pack under the bottom step on the far side. There were only 2 missing and the rest were still cold. What could be better, cold soft drinks on a hot day right at lunch time and steps to sit on on while eating. A little before 3 I passed a sign saying 4 miles to go so I figured to be there by 5. A few minutes later I saw a guy coming the other way so I stepped out of the way but he stopped and started talking. I eventually indicated I wanted to move on and he said he was going to turn around but that I could go ahead since I was probably faster. I don't generally like to hike close to others so I moved out pretty fast. Well, I was't fast enough. Every time I looked down I could see his shadow right behind me. Up hill, down hill, I was going just about as fast as I could go and he stayed right behind me. Along the way he asked me how old I was. We finally came to the high point about 30 minutes later and I paused for a sip of water and he said he had Gatorade and Oreos and asked if I wanted some. As you may imagine, by this time I was getting somewhat concerned about this situation so I said no and that I needed to go. I knew the trail was mostly downhill the rest of the way so I took off at as close to a run as I could with a pack and managed to out hike him. I got to the shelter at 4:30. He showed up 15 minutes later and I made sure he did not see me. He talked to another hiker in the shelter and during the conversation asked him how old he was.

There was other stuff like toothpaste, toothbrushes, bandaids, and even a bag of dog biscuits for hiking dogs. After a quick snack I was back on the trail. I should have realized that it was an omen.

All employees, although well tattooed, are extremely polite. I get my clothes washed and gear cleaned today so I'm free tomorrow.","Wapiti Shelter

Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561737,"Light, rain, drizzle starting about noon. Off and on the rest of the day. The Captain is a guy who lets hikers camp in his yard. There is a short zip line across a stream to get to his property. He has a big yard, several picnic tables and free cold drinks in a refrigerator on his back porch. I've never stayed here before.Stopped raining about dark.","Pearisburg, VA

Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561741,No rain today. About 3 miles before the shelter came to a road where a guy was cooking hot dogs and had a cooler of cold drinks. Short mileage day so I had plenty of time to take a break.,"The Captains

Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561754,Started raining during the night. Foggy and damp during the morning. Haven't had phone service the past two nights so I stopped on Brush Mtn near the Audie Murphy plane crash site and was able to call home by standing on a bench. Very nice campsite where other hikers ahead of me had stopped back in 2010. No one else was here tonight.,"Laurel Creek Shelter

Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561859,"After about 9 miles the trail crosses a paved road and the guide mentions that if you turn left and go .4 miles there is a convenience store.That means the round trip is almost a mile, but walking on a road is a lot different from walking in the woods. I went there in 2010 so I knew it wasn't a bad walk and since it was about lunch time I went again. Bought a few snacks and a big soft drink and called home. As I was getting ready to pack up I heard thunder. It looked like it was in the direction I had come but before I could get packed the storm arrived. Very hard rain for about 10 minutes but I was under the roof overhang. The hardest rain I've seen so far on this hike. Did I do anything special to deserve avoiding this storm that would have left me soaked for the rest of the day? Jesus says in Matthew and Charley Brown says in Peanuts the the rain falls on the just and the unjust. So I can't say I received a special blessing and besides, about an hour later, the rain did fall on me, just not as hard or as long.","VA Hwy 620

Red Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561873,"Hot day. The spring pollen season finally caught up with me and I had to take a pill this morning. I hope it will be over when I get back. In 2006 I was hiking in the pollen for almost 3 weeks when Spring caught up with me and I stayed with the seasonal change as we moved north. In 2010 I missed most of it when I went home for 2 weeks. Since my wife is going to pick me up tomorrow to go back home to GA for the NRA annual meeting I'm hoping Spring will be over by the time I get back. Got to the hotel, the front desk did not have quarters for the washing machine, the convenience store didn't have any, so I walked about a quarter mile to a bank.","Campbell Shelter

Very large shelter, probably could hold twenty people on two levels plus a covered porch on two sides at least 8 feet wide.
