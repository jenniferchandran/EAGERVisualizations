Then you would get two or three of everything; two eggs, two strips of bacon, two pancakes. Shaw's now has new management. I asked the new owner if they still asked two or three? He said no. Now they just assume you want three of everything. He was telling me about the home fries he makes and the ingredients which included garlic. I told him I'm allergic to garlic. He told me to come down at 6:15 A.M. and remind him and he'd make me a separate batch. They had thirty people for breakfast.The new owner, trail name 'poet', was the one who dropped me off at the trail head. He said I had a pretty chill day ahead of me. The nine miles to the shelter was fairly easy, not much elevation change. It still had lots of roots and rocks but fairly easy by Maine standards. I'm hiking from Monson to Andover because these first two easy days will help me get ready for how tough the hiking in Maine is. I will be trying real hard to stay vertical. There are lots of people hiking north, mostly thru hikers. You can tell which ones are thru hikers, they don't want to stop and chat and they're hiking like there on a mission. I met some young kids who were taking a break. I found out there with an 'Appalachian Trail over Maine' group. There were different hikes you could sign up for lasting a varying amont of days. They were doing the 17 day version. I noticed an accent which I asked them about. They were from Quebec. Several of them were from Montreal. I told them my wife and I had visited Montreal and stayed at the Gouveneur Montreal hotel. They said that was a good area. My practicing french was limited to exchanging 'ca va's' and 'au revoir's' but that was a fun occurrence.","Shaw's Lodging

Best Part - Crossing the ford near Moxie Bald PondBiggest Complaint - People mixMeeting a lot of new people can be fun. Then again when the number of people your meeting goes way up and some of the people are not really people you like then it can become undesirable. Maybe I'm just getting a little depressed.
Today I got pretty tired by the end of the hike. I wished I would get to the shelter sooner. Then when I got there some of the people at the shelter I had a bad first impression of. Then a lot more people showed up. None of the people really had any attributes I should feel bad about. I think I just had new people overload.When you come to a stream that you actually have to ford it can be a chore. You have to take off your pack, take off your boots, take off your socks, put on your sandals, tie your boots together, put your pack back on, hang your boots around your neck, cross the stream being careful not to slip on the slippery rocks, take your boots off of your neck, take your pack off, take your sandals off, dry your feet, put your socks back on, put your boots back on, hang your wet sandals on your pack, put your pack back on. Why did I say it was the best part of the day? Because the cold stream water on your feet really feels good.Tonight we're camped next to a small lake although its called a pond. Some frogs are vocalizing. Also some loons are having quite a conversation. The refections on the lake were quite impressive.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to

Best Part - Extended Lunch on top of Bald MountainBiggest complaint - Battery backup only worked a littleToday I chose to only do 4.1 miles. If I had gone on to the next shelter it would have been a 13.1 mile day and I wasn't ready to do that long a day yet. The first two miles today were going to the top of Bald mountain. It wasn't bad and sometimes there were cool breezes. Hiking the A.T. is hard work and cool breezes are greatly appreciated. Half way up I saw I was getting cell tower service and I was able to call my wife. When I reached the top I had lunch and since I was still getting good phone service I decided to post a couple trail journal entries including uploading pictures. I was using up quite a bit of cell phone battery but since I had two battery backups I felt it would be OK. That evening when I used one of my battery backup it only took my battery percentage from 12 to 31 percent. I decided I'd have to use my phone more sparingly.
The first night I stayed in the shelter but last night and tonight I'm using my tent. Some hikers I met, Cosmo and Wanda, use their tent every night. After Cosmo checks the possible tent sites near the shelter he lets me know where the potential tent sites for my size tent are. Most of the people you meet on the A.T. often help each other out. The sight I'm using tonight is a raised dirt flat area with rocks on three sides and just the right size for my Big Agnus two man tent. Cosmo and Wanda have a Big Agnus three man tent. You may have noticed that what the tent manufacturers idea of how many people should fit in their tents is off by one.","Moxie Bald Lean-to

Hiking is getting not as hard. I was going to say easier but that gives the wrong impression. It's not getting easy. It's getting not as hard.Today was too hot. The high was in the eighties. Being hot and hiking uphill makes for unhappy hiking. We had to hike up Pleasant Pond mountain today. The peak was at mile eight of a nine mile day. Often when you get to the top of a mountain you get lots of cool breezes. Today only a few. Not enough as far as I was concerned. And there weren't as many blue berries as yesterday's mountain. I still picked some but I only had enough to add to my breakfast. Yesterday I picked enough to also add to my supper. Most northbound thru hikers just exchange pleasantries. Today after one passed me he turned and said he had a question. Was the ford near Moxie a real ford. All the fords listed in the A.T. guide he had been crossing lately were just rock hops. There hasn't been a lot of rain lately. I told him that it was still indeed a real take off your boots ford. He was pleased. It's good to run into someone who really appreciates the finer things in life.","Bald mountain lean-to

End - 10:36Best Part - Lady from Quebec at the roadBiggest Complaint - No phone service where the trail crosses the roadI always seem to hike faster when I'm hiking to a trail town, especially if it's downhill like it was today. I did the 5.7 miles in 2 1/2 hours. When I got to the road there was no phone service. Yesterday when I used my other battery backup it only took my phone from 17% to 18%. The battery backups are old. I've figured out that they're not holding their charge as long as they used to. I had been saving what was left of my battery to use at the road to call the Sterling Inn to get a free shuttle. All for naught. There was no phone service but the forest ranger's station was nearby and he let me use his phone.Also at the road was a car with the door open and a lady sitting inside. I noticed the license plate was from Quebec so I decided to try and practice a little french. This time I used just a little bit more of my french. I asked her in french what her name was. She responded 'France'. I thought I had asked my question  incorrectly but she said her name was France, perhaps short for Françoise. She lived in Quebec City but had been born in Montreal.The Sterling Inn is a real nice place. It's history goes back to the 1800's. I got a private room for $40 instead of $25 for a bunkhouse bed, actually a room with 4 bunks you share with other hikers. The rooms have different names and the bunkhouse room is called Katahdin. Katahdin is the name of the mountain north bound  hikers climb to finish their thru hike. This Katahdin is on the second floor so you have to climb to get to room Katahdin.","Pleasant Pond Lean-to

The ferry is actually a canoe. You have to fill out and sign a form and you have to wear a life jacket but the ferry is free. The ferry captain (the guy who paddles the canoe) explains that this is where the Kennebec river feeds into Wyman lake and there is a very strong rip current that makes attempts to ford the river dangerous.The A.T. Guide said there was a 0.1 mile side trail to a waterfall. Since I had a short day I took the side trail. The guide didn't mention that the side trail was very steep. It was a pretty nice waterfall.Just before you reach the next shelter there's a 0.1 mile side trail to Harrison's Pierce Pond Sports Camp. You can get a bed, a shower and breakfast for $40. I was going to stay at the shelter and just get breakfast for $12 but decided to go ahead and stay there. Along with avoiding the gnats at the shelter I got a little more piano practice time. There's also a pool table.The breakfast is a dozen pancakes, eggs and sausage. Tim calls them patriotic pancakes since they're red, white and blue (raspberries, apple and blueberries).I'm staying in a cabin with two beds (supply your own sleeping bag), a wood stove, a table, chairs and an oil lamp. There's lots of blueberries to pick right off the front porch.After playing piano and listening to Tim play piano much much better than me I played several games of pool with a north bound hiker. We also played cribbage using a cribbage board Tim made out a piece of a stump. It was an enjoyable evening followed by making a fire in my wood burning stove, reading my A.T. guide using the oil lamp and then getting a good night's sleep.","The Sterling Inn

Four of the five at the table all finished all twelve. The other hiker didn't have any. She's staying gluten free on her hike. She only had the eggs and sausage.No more 80 degree days for now. Cooler weather is better for hikingThe terrain was pretty level today, not much elevation change. Still by the end of the ten miles I was pretty tired.   The ponds around here are what we would call lakes. It can be seven miles long but it's still called a pond. Some of them are called carry ponds. They call them carry ponds like we would call them portage lake. Same idea just a different verb.  Today I ran into Nana and Big Red. Nana is a section hiker and for this section her daughter is hiking with her. Two days before we watched 'The Phantom of the Opera' DVD at the Sterling Inn together. Often you run into people hiking the opposite direction because they get shuttled to some other part of the trail and hike back to their vehicle. People also slack pack, leave there pack and take a days worth of food, get shuttled forward and hike back to their pack. Then they get shuttled again to the same spot and continue on their hike. Some people think that's cheating but a lot of people do that now.","Harrison's Sports Camp

I've been hiking long enough uphill should be no big deal by now but it was putting me in a bad mood. I think I'm not enjoying this hike much because I'm not really hiking with anyone. Earlier I was ending up at the same lean-tos with Cosmo and Wanda. They're way ahead of me now. Almost all of the shelters have a journal hikers write in. That way you know how far ahead of you other hikers are. I hadn't been checking them but today I did. It said some hiker was trying to catch up with Cosmo and Wanda, Cosmo and Wanda were trying to catch up with Lady and the Tramp. This lean-to has a two seat privy so Tramp responded to someone's question saying that Lady and the Tramp don't poop together, privy time is private time.  It doesn't happen too often but I was the only hiker at this shelter tonight. A couple of day hikers showed up, Chris and Jackie. Chris is an independent journalist/photographer. You can check his website at cbennettphoto.com.  He's taking photos and writing an article on the A.T. for 'Maine The Way'. Maine The Way started as an Instagram account that took off and became very popular. Now they're going to come out with a quarterly magazine. He asked me if he could interview me for his article. I said OK. He basically asked me why I decided to hike the A.T. He also wanted to take pictures. I switched from wearing my hat to wearing my bandana. He took pictures of me sitting at the shelter and also standing with my hiking stick with the woods in the background. I didn't get to put on makeup or get my hair done but I did kind of feel like a model.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

Two lean-tos here instead of one. This 10.2 miles included ascending Little Bigelow Mtn. and Bigelow Mtn., easily my toughest day so far. It turns out the tough trail today was three times tougher than what I'd been doing. I knew about the elevation change coming up but I'd forgotten how tough the trail in Maine can get. Not just rocks and roots but climbing up and down steep piles of rocks. Lots and lots of never ending steep piles of rocks. Fortunately 7.2 miles into my 10.2 mile day there's a campsite in the gap between Avery peak and Bigelow mountain west peak. I'd been hiking 8 hours and I'd have to hike at least another three hours to get to Horn's Pond lean-tos over lots of treacherous uphill and downhill rock climbs. I might have made it by dark but considering how tired I was already I would likely have taken a fall. I convinced myself it would be a wrong decision to try to go on.  The views today were fantastic. By the time you get to Avery peak you're above tree line. There's probably a half mile of 360 degree views. Getting there wasn't so fantastic.","Little Bigelow lean-to

I decided to not spend a zero day in Stratton and go back to the RV instead. I'm spending two zero days and changing my hiking plan. I'll hike north from Rangeley, ME back to Stratton and then hike south from Rangeley to Andover to complete my hike. Some of the terrain will be easier northbound than southbound. The hiking has gotten tough and I'm trying to what I can to make it easier.

We drove 9 miles east and there's a parking lot where the A.T. crosses. It was after 4 o'clock but I only had 1.8 miles to the lean-to. There was one hiker in the shelter. He graduated high school and was spending a year figuring things out or something like that before starting college. His thing was bringing ingredients and spices to make his meals. Lots of dehydrated food. He even had lots of dehydrated eggs. My experience is that making eggs from dehydrated eggs usually doesn't turn out to well.

First Saddle Back mountain at 4120 feet. One and half miles later you have The Horn at 4020 feet. After that is Saddleback Junior at a messily 3655. Of course you have to hike down and up the gaps in between.   The first mountain was above tree line and the second was almost above tree line. On the way up The Horn I ran into Cozmo and Wanda having lunch. It was good to see them again. We ran into each other because I skipped ahead and now we were hiking opposite directions. I took a break and we enjoyed a good talk. I will likely never see them again.  Half way hiking down the horn I slipped and pulled a groin muscle. I swore a lot. Let me repeat that. I swore a lot. This is what I didn't want to happen. It hurt some but I kept hiking. Then halfway down Saddleback Junior I slipped again and gave my already sour muscle a good jerk. Now it hurt quite a bit. It hurt to do a lot of the things I needed to do to navigate the steep downhill rock climbs. This made deciding how to navigate difficult spots take longer. My 8.9 mile day took 10 hours and I was hurting pretty good by the time I reached the shelter. I decided I'd have to do a zero day the next day. I was more tired than hungry and since I'd have to stretch my food I skipped supper. A.T. hiking is not all fun and games.,"Poplar Ridge Lean-to

One thing you do is read the shelter journal. One entry was in french. Finding an entry in french isn't really surprising since Maine borders Quebec. One person told me two thirds of the radio stations in this area are in french. I tried translating it but I had to use Google Translate a lot.  I decided to skip breakfast and use my extra supper, a Raman, for lunch. This would put the number of meals I needed and the numbers I had equal. In the past I have changed my three packages of oatmeal a day breakfast to two packages a day.   It threatened rain in the afternoon but didn't start till around five thirty or six. Lots of thru hikers were showing up. The shelter designed for six ended up holding seven. Most of the other hikers had set up their tents before the heavy rain. One rain drenched hiker had to just stand under the front of the shelter roof and waIt for it to stop. We had the seven staying in the shelter and probably another eight standing room only hikers hanging out talking, cooking, eating and whatever while we waited for the rain to stop.

That still means wet roots and rocks the next morning. Then to make matters worse it rained briefly in the morning to make sure the trail would be wet.  About twelve minutes after I started to hike I took a chance getting down and beyond a wet granite boulder and slipped. This tweaked my pulled muscle. Not a good way to start the day. It was definitely a situation where I should have taken the advice that I recommend to lots of hikers; when in doubt, but slide. It wasn't too bad and I hiked on. Now it wasn't a case of hurting a lot but more of being a case of being sore all day.   I did come to a river that was either a risky rock hop or a take your boots off to ford. Doing a risky rock hop with a bum leg is a bad idea. It was another take your boots off ford. Time consuming but not a real problem.    Seven thru hikers showed up around 5:00 PM at the shelter. Two pushed on for another six miles. The rest stayed but they used their tents instead of staying in the shelter. They made a fire. Most thru hikers don't make a fire but this group did. I noticed several used the fire to make supper. One way thru hikers make their packs lighter is to go 'no cook'. Not carrying a stove and fuel and mostly eating food you don't need to cook is a way to get your load lighter. I'd guess they carry some food to cook and only do that if they take time to make a fire. They were all talking amongst themselves and I was just in the background listening. To break the ice I asked how many miles the A.T. is this year. Many of them in unison answered, ""Two thousand one hundred and eighty-nine"". The trail gets longer each year when changes are made to make very difficult sections easier. Tomorrow will be a big day for these thru hikers. They will be reaching a plaque showing they are 200 miles from Mt. Kathadin, the northern terminus of the A.T. They will also have completed 2000 miles.

Best Part - On a missionBiggest Complaint - Took longer than expected  The day started with a mile uphill. Since I was only going to go 6.2 miles and it was cold and windy in the morning I didn't get started until 9:53. When the trail reached the top of Spaulding mountain there was a couple there pointing out there was a steep 150 yard side trail to the very top. I said no thank you. When I discussed my hiking plans they told me it was supposed to rain tomorrow morning. I said it was supposed to rain tomorrow afternoon. They told me actually it was supposed to rain in the morning and clear up in the afternoon. A short while later I was going to call Tish. I had plenty of battery so I decided to check the weather myself. Indeed it was 60% chance of rain in the morning with 1/4 of an inch of rain possible. Rain on steep up and down rock climbs can lead to injuries. My leg was feeling pretty good. I could move it any which way and it didn't hurt. I checked what time it would take to hike the 13.5 miles all the way to Stratton. It looked like I could make it before dark. I called Tish and told her I might change my plan and try to make it to Stratton. I made it a short phone call and started hiking with a purpose. So far I had been taking it easy and it felt good to be pushing it.   I wanted to get to Crocker crique campsite, my original destination, by 2:00 P.M. I didn't make it till 2:19. I took 12 minutes to eat lunch and kept hiking. I still had a mile to get to the top of South Crocker mountain. I thought I was near the top and asked a south bounder if the trail went to top or just skirted the top. He said it did indeed go all the way to the top. It seemed like it took forever but I got there and called Tish to let her know I was definitely hiking on to Stratton. I told her I'd probably get there around 7:00. Another 5.2 miles to go. I took fifty minutes to do the half a mile downhill and a half a mile uphill to North Crocker mountain. Now the rest was almost all downhill. I stopped to ask a south bounder how far to the road. I thought maybe a another mile but he said two to three more miles. I figured if it got past 7:00 I'd call Tish and let her know I was still hiking but I wouldn't be able to tell how much left to go because my A.T. Guide only referenced a spring four miles from the road. The later it got and the darker it got I was getting worried it would get dark before I got to the end of the trail. I just kept incessantly hiking. I didn't even stop to check the time or to call Tish. The darkness was starting to make it hard to see the trail. If it had gotten any darker I would have had to put my headlamp on. I reached the road at 8:01. In retrospect I really should have called Tish. I had been totally focused on hiking and getting to the end before it got dark.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

Best Part - Only four more daysBiggest Complaint - Rain   I decided to do this last 36.5 mile section northbound also. Since Tish is here to drop me off and pick me up I can decide which direction looks easier.   Well I got to use my rain gear today. It wasn't supposed to rain. I guess even a small chance of rain is still a chance of rain. It drizzled for about an hour, stopped for half an hour and then drizzled for another twenty minutes. Of course it drips off the trees for awhile and all the plants you brush up against are wet. After awhile I noticed the plants I brushed up against weren't wet. I had been the victim of an isolated shower. Not everyone got rained on. Lucky me.    Arriving at the campsite early was a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect to get there until 6:30 but I got there at 5:30. Sometimes the guide is wrong. Sometimes my estimates are wrong.   As I was putting up my tent I was thinking this will probably be the last time I'll be putting up my tent on the A.T. The next two nights are shelters and I likely will stay in them. Over the years I've learned the pros and cons of shelters and tents. If you want to sleep in, pitch your tent. If there aren't too many people in the shelter, stay in the shelter especially if you expect rain.    Since this is only a campsite, no shelter available, someone put a journal in the privy. Some people commented, 'clever idea'. Write a journal entry while you poop. There was no entry from Cosmo and Wanda.   I said the 'Best Part' is 'Only four more days'. This tuff trail in southern Maine has made completing the trail a chore. More than once I've considered saying the hell with it, I don't have to finish. Anyways, only four more days.","RV

Just didn't want to get up and I thought 8.7 miles shouldn't take too long. I knew the first 2.8 miles were uphill ascending Old Blue Mountain and the first 0.8 of that would be real steep but after that it shouldn't be too bad. It took me almost two hours to do the first 0.8 miles. I actually think my A.T. Guide was wrong but it sure was tough. It just doesn't seem like it should take 10.5 hours to hike 8.7 miles. Another day where I was totally exhausted by the end of the day. They say southern Maine is tough and they're right.   I did take about 10-15 minutes to stop and talk with Cosmo and Wanda. My decision to do Andover to Rangeley northbound while they're going southbound meant we got to meet one more time. The family hiking southbound also passed by while we were talking. Seeing a six year old girl with little hiking sticks and little gaters (covers for your socks and boot tops) is really something to see. She and her mom lead the way while the twelve year old boy and the dad follow soon thereafter. They were staying in their tent at the Poplar Ridge shelter the other evening when it was raining. I noticed the dad and the son would hang out at the shelter during the rain then later the mom and the daughter would hang out at the shelter while the dad and the son would be in the tent. I guess all four in the tent at the same time can get crowded.   Well tomorrow is only 8.3 miles. I hope they're not more of these tough longer than normal miles like I had today.,"Black Brook Campsite

Best Part - Lunch with TishBiggest Complaint - Took a spill   Today I hike over ME 17 right at an overlook where there's parking to view the overlook. Tish met me there with pop and apples. It was most the way up my last big uphill climb and knowing Tish was meeting me there was a big mood booster.   I managed to take a spill on a granite slab where my foot went out from under me. I bruised my hip and elbow. My elbow needed a bandage and I'm a little soar but no major issues.   My last evening on the trail had several interesting people. There was an economics professor from the Czech Republic, a college kid who had been born in Nova Scotia, a lady card dealer from Colorado, and a man from some other part of Colorado. He had been laid off. I didn't catch what his job had been but he commented that after spending several months on the A.T. he's thinking about changing to some job where he won't be inside all day.   The man from the Czech Republic, along with being a interesting person, uses Polar Pure to purify his water. That's what I use. It's a small bottle with iodine crystals. You fill the bottle with water and you put capfuls of the iodine solution in your water bottles. In all my  hiking the trail this is the first person using the same thing I've been using. He also collects mushrooms along the trail, cuts them up, boils them in water and adds Raman. He said this batch turned out pretty good.   When I mentioned I'm trying to learn french he said he was too. He showed me the book he was using. I could read the short stories that were in french but where they discussed vocabulary which showed a french word and it's equivalent in Czech that didn't do me any good.   I'm starting to get sentimental about finishing my A.T. hiking. It's times like these where you meet interesting people that makes this fun.","Bemis Mountain Lean-to

Pidgeon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575998,"Start - 7:50End - 3:16Best Part - Finally doneBiggest Complaint - Fell in a muddy bog   After getting sentimental last evening visiting with fellow hikers, this morning I had to do more uphill hiking. I will be glad when this is over. I will admit you get a great feeling when you reach the top of a long uphill climb, but doing the actual hiking could be described as 'not fun'.     One fun thing I did today was over estimate my ability to make a wide step to get over a bog section. The momentum of myself and my backpack could not be stopped and I fell in a muddy bog. Wet boots and muddy legs resulted. Lunch break was coming up soon so I switched to dry socks then.   Another hiker also stopped at the same campsite for lunch. He had been born and spent the first seven years of his life in north Africa so he had learned french. Then after moving to America his classmates would ask him to say things in french and would laugh when he did. He then stopped speaking french altogether and basically forgot how to speak french.    I called Tish and gave her an estimate of when I would arrive at the road. Only 4.8 more miles. It turned out that that part of the trail was pretty easy and I actually got there over an hour early. I sat on a rock just before the end so I wouldn't finish until she arrived. Silly me.   As to the question of whether I would want to do this again. If I was 20 years old I would say yes. I'm not in my 20's anymore. No more long distance hiking for now.   Happy trails","Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to
