Eddie Deemer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555876,"This is an odd sensation since I have been employed full time since I was 16 years old. Even while in College. I have all day to do it and ""nothing to do"". Its odd, but its only the second day and I already am antsy. I wonder if I can make it the whole 2200 miles, I am nervous about money, injuries, the safety of my wife alone for days at a time in a camper, I worry that I will lose my skills, my edge, and knowledge. I am excited for the challenge, for what this could do for members of my family. I can't wait to start. I already have a trail family, of sorts: the Menger's who live here in Moore hiked half of it last year and have given me gear advice, encouragement, and friendship. A friend of a friend is taking his family on the trail a few days before I start and we will be looking for the Owens'. I have many friends who live along the trail who have promised to come see me as I pass by and a few who want to hike a few miles with me. I am a mess of emotions and ideas and plans. I wouldn't be adverse to a prayer or two.",,Unemployed,"Mar 08, Wed",0
Eddie Deemer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556333,"300 miles down. Windy and blowing the trailer all over the place. Getting 8.2 mpg, which is about half what I had thought. It's cold, 35 degrees, but wanted a final weather check on the shelter and bag. Slept in skivys and stayed pretty warm. Driving to Memphis today.",,Moore to Arkansas,"Mar 14, Tue",0
