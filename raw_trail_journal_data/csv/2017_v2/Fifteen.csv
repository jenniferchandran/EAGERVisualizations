Fifteen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553227,"OK, here we go. I hiked 1430 miles in 2013 with a flip in there and fell in the Whites and had to come off for shoulder surgery. Went back in 2014 and finished but since the rehab took me past the 'thru' definition it ended up being a couple of LASH (long ass section hikes). The plan was to go back in 2016 and do a true thru. In March of 2016 less than a month before I was scheduled to leave I had a motorcycle accident and spent 19 days in the hospital...then 2 months on a walker. I now have a lot of hardware in my pelvis and a long screw in my lower backbone. All well now but the rehab delayed my start forward to this year. I'll be starting in Troutville, Va., near the Blue Ridge Parkway and Roanoke. I will be going north, then after Katahdin I'll bus/fly back to there and head south to finish. I'm getting a later start than the 2013 hike and that is the reason for the planned flip/flop. I will start somewhere around 4/22 or 23. I can't wait to get back out there. I have a 2013 TJ with over 1500 pictures if anyone is interested. Looking forward to seeing you guys on the trail. ""Fifteen"" is the trail name given to me on the trail in 2013 less than a week in due to my boot size...AKA Rex.",,Home,"Jan 12, Thu",0

Fifteen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553230,"Well, just a little over three months to go. These will be a busy three months. I retired in May of 2012, but the last three years I have worked for H R Block during tax season. Within a couple of days of wrapping up the office after the last day of filing which is the 18th this year, I will be on the trail.
I always like to have a plan for what to do in my down time and this year it will be the AT again. Earlier today I came up with my plan for next year and it is to do the 'four corners motorcycle ride'. You start at any corner and ride to each of the four, and they are Blaine Wa., Madawaska Me., Key West Fl., and San Ysidro Ca. You can start at any of these 4 and go to all any route you choose. It is not necessary to return to the start point. Of the list of completed ones I looked at it ranges from -9000 to 12000+ miles. To receive the certificate of completion you must do it in 21 days or less and furnish a photo of you in each of these places...city hall, police station, post office any one of these will validate,also a dated printed fuel receipt. They say it averages out to a little over 400 miles a day at a minimum. This looks like it would be a blast doing a lot of blue highways thru the US. Anyway, the AT this year and 4corners next should keep me occupied and vitalized assuming I can stay upright throughout each of them hahaha. If you know my history you will know that will be an improvement. What's that expression again...nothing ventured nothing gained.",,Home,"Jan 15, Sun",0

Fifteen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553232,"Ninety five days to jump off. I am so out of shape it is not funny. When I started in March of 2013 I weighted an all time high of 242. By the time I got to Damascus I was at 200...more or less hung there the rest of the hike. As of this morning I am at a new all time high of 247. I have a little pot, not a huge one since I am 6'3"" but I would love to get back to my best hiking weight...we'll see. It is a great way to lose weight, you can eat all you want and still lose weight as long as you walk your butt off, and belly in my case.
I saw a TV interview back then of a long distance hiker and the question he was asked was ""how do you get ready or in shape for a 2000 mile hike?"". His answer was spot on ""You hike the first 500 miles"". I found that to definitely be the case. So all of you worried about being in condition to do the hike, trust me if you hang in there long enough you will be.
Hope to see you out...I'll be the slow walking 70 year old having a blast.",,Home,"Jan 17, Tue",0
Fifteen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556788,"On March 18th of 2016 I decided to crash my motorcycle into the back of an SUV. This happened one month before I had planned on starting another AT hike. Well I spent 18 days in the hospital and now have 6 pins in my pelvic rings and a long screw in my back. I spent a couple of months on a walker with non-weight baring restrictions on my left leg. Long story short all better now. I went from Boise to Nebraska a couple of weeks ago to pick up my replacement motorcycle and drove 884 miles back with the I-80 winds gusting over 50 miles an hour with no windshield. No I'm not macho just a little crazy and have a passion for bike riding. I am going to start another thru hike on April 23 and since I am starting so late I will start in Daleville, Va. and go to Katahdin then flip back south and finish. I can't wait to get back on the trail again and shake the rust off of my new hardware and lose some of this excess weight I've gained. See you on the trail.Fifteen",,Anniversary,"Mar 18, Sat",0
Fifteen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564268,"Well, it looks like I will have to put this off yet again. I sure am glad I have hiked the whole thing already in 2013/14. My cardiologist after a angiogram suggested I not do a long hike at this time. Unfortunately my wife was in the room when he advised it. I will be going on a long motorcycle ride instead, 5000-6000 miles. Coming from Boise Idaho to Damascus for trail days then up and down trail via motorcycle and doing some trail magic for a few days before heading to Canada and doing a trans-Canada highway ride back to Idaho. My plan is now to start late April of next year and do a flip flop beginning at Harpers Ferry to Katahdin, then flipping back to Harpers and heading to Springer. Looking forward to seeing some of my 2013 hiker friends at Trail Days.Â  See you out there!!!","Home
