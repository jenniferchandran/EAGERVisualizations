Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554366,"Hi there! My names Adam and I'm currently teaching English in South Korea. I'm from North Carolina but never really got into hiking until I came to Korea; almost 5 years ago now. I fell in love with it! I tackled every major peak in Korea, except which will be finished shortly. I haven't done a lot of camping or overnighters so this will be new to me on the app trail. I fly out April 3rd from Seoul to my hometown in NC, and then will be starting the following weekend at either Springer or Harpers Ferry for a flip flop. I'll be hiking with my uncle who is a missionary working with Sudanese refugees, and will be trying to get as many sponsors as possible to donate per mile to his cause. If your're interested in helping out, leave me a message on here or email me at acrane86@gmail.com. I've all of my gear listed on here, so if you see anything missing or that could be added let me know. Current baseweight is around 19lbs. Would like to get that down to around 15. Thanks for reading!",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Thu",0

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555437,"So I turned in my 1 month notice to my employer here in Korea, and it is 1 month and 1 week until I start my flip-flop thru hike from Harpers Ferry north to Katahdin; and then south to Springer Mountain. I'm super exited. I've got my base weight down to about 19lbs which isn't the best, but definitely isn't the worst. I finally learned how to pitch my lunar solo correctly, which was a pretty steep learning curve. A few more practice hikes here in Korea, and then it will be time to say good bye to Korea and hello to the Appalachian Trail!","

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559346,"So tomorrow is finally the day. I've been preparing for close to 6-7 months and tomorrow I will finally start hiking with my uncle. We are starting at swift run gap near Elkton VA and heading north to Katahdin. Then we will head south to Springer Mountain. We start April 9th and should finish around mid September to early October. I will hopefully be able to update this weekly and the blog will basically be a day to day of what happened the previous week. Today my parents drove me up here to VA and we met up with my uncle and his wife, then we had a lovely dinner and watched some of the masters coverage. Tomorrow we plan to start hiking around 10am and go for 10 miles to bearfence mountain hut, where we will stay for the night. So, if you're interested follow along and I hope you enjoy hearing about the day to day of the trail. Adam","

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560177,"The first day on the trail went well. David and I had too much food packed, so the packs were pretty heavy. After breakfast at the hotel we were dropped off at swift run gap at 10:15, said our goodbyes, then started off down the trail. We hiked for a few miles and came across our first spring and filtered water for the first time. The sawyer squeeze filter worked wonderfully. We finished our hike at 4:30 and had the shelter to ourselves for the night. It went about as well as it could have for our first day.","Swift Run Gap

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560179,"We woke up early on day two as would be the case for the next five mornings and probably the rest of the trip. There's a saying that hiker midnight is 8pm. That saying holds very true. We were up at 6am and after cooking breakfast we headed out about 8am. We hiked 11.5 miles to rock springs hut. The day started out interestingly enough, after 2 minutes on the trail I looked up and saw a bobcat in the middle of the trail. Luckily it didn't want any trouble and it wandered off the trail. The trail was pretty easy after that and we arrived at the next hut around 430. There were two people in the shelter, so we decided to tent.","Bearfence Hut

We met our first NOBO thruhiker named Hawk who started in February from Georgia. We had a nice lunch at the Skyland wayside on skyline drive. The trail was fairly easy today and we arrived at 430 to our shelter. So far we have seen two deers, a bobcat, and a barred owl. So far the trail has been kind to us.

We stopped off to check out a hut we were passing by,but coming out of the hut I made a wrong turn and we walked back down the mountain we had just walked up. Doh! We stayed at a hut that the AT guide said had water. Well, the water was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. We boiled it, filtered it, and used aquamira. We also added gatorade mix to it because it looked and tasted so bad. But it's been a few days now and I'm not sick. What doesn't kill you...","Byrds nest #3

They are a bit slower than us but we run into them here and there throughout the day. We also stayed with them at the shelter last night. We had a nice breakfast at the elkwallow wayside which consisted of hasbrowns, eggs, toast, and bacon. The trail was fairly steep today. We left out about 830 and finished at 4:30. The shelter was pretty busy so we tented. I've decided to send my tent back home, and get a new one that is free standing. The ground here is too rocky to stake out a tent.","Byrds nest #4

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560193,"Today was a nice 10.5 mile hike that was pretty flat minus one steep climb. We ran into Jeff and Dennis a few times as well. Tonight the shelter was very nice. We met another thruhiker named fresh ground who was a pretty awesome guy. He was hiking with a few guys doing a Shenandoah thru hike. So, it was their last day on trail, he decided to hike 3.5 miles down to the road, hitch into town, go to the grocery store, buy a chicken, beers, cokes, and fruit, hitch back to the trailhead, and then hike the 3.5 miles back uphill to celebrate with them. All this after hiking 20 miles in a day. Pretty awesome!","Gravel springs hut

The owners are very friendly. They shuttled us to the post office to pick up our packages. Then we had a great meal at a local reataurant. I had a cheeseburger and David had death by pork. It looked wonderful. After that we walked around Front Royal, and then resupplied at the local supermarket. Also, I got to shower for the first time in 7 days, and they did my laundry!

We stopped at Bears Den Hostel 3 miles into our day but decided not to stay and push on for a few more miles to a campsite. We tented for the night and I found out it was my sock liners giving me the problem. So, I've quit wearing them and all is well with my feet.","Sam Moore shelter.

At the end of the day we stayed at a shelter with two guys from MD. They told us that if we hiked 15 miles to the next shelter, we could order pizza. So we had some motivation for the next day!","Nowhere

Today our water bag had two holes in it. Not a big deal but it made it more difficult for us to filter water. So we just ended up usimg aquamira chlorine drops to filter our water. The trail was nice and flat all day though, and the pizza was delicious!","Rocky Run Shelter

We had our first successful hitchhike into town for a resupply from a very friendly day hiker at Penn Marr park. At the shelter we met two other thru hikers ""hand in mouth"" and ""mrs. joy"" We think mrs joy enjoyed a little too much of the scotch she was carrying. She was a little tipsy.","Ensign Cowell shelter

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561920,Today was a very rainy day once again. We stopped after 10 miles because it was so cold. We could of pushed another 5 miles but it just wasn't worth it. There was a local at the shelter who had a fire going. Hand in mouth was there again and luckily he stayed in the other shelter so we didn't have to hear his snoring! We also set our tents up in the shelter for some extra warmth. Glad I switched to a free stand ing tent!,"Deer Lick shelter.

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561922,Today it was once again cold and rainy. Hiking in the rain isn't that bad but putting on wet clothes and shoes isn't any fun! The trail was very flat and easy though. We stayed at a shelter with a couple who are retired and live in their RV. They are just hiking back to where they parked the RV. We also stayed with an older lady who is starting a flip flop thru hike. Very friendly!,"Rocky Mountain shelter

We met David's friend Bryan and his wife Carla, as well as his three kids. They grilled chicken for us and gave us a lot of supplies. They are also going to mail our packages for us! They drove us to a store to resupply, and then dropped us off at our hotel. They also treated us to ice cream! So that's it for now.

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563143,"Today was a pretty tough trail day. We went through the ""rock maze"" which was just dumb. The trail took you through big rocks you had to climb up and over for no reason other than to make the trail more difficult. Today we also used our new stove a MSR pocket rocket which boils water very quickly. We also have a few extra 1L water bags which makes colllecting water easier. We ran into ""Hand In Mouth"" again, but he was moving on to meet friends and get off trail for a few days, so we probably won't be seeing him again.","Pine Grove Furnance General Store
",Alec Kennedy shelter,"Apr 27, Thu",15.40
Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563146,"Today we hiked over 18 miles which was our longest day yet. The trail was nice and flat the whole day, but the 18 miles were still taxing. The trail brought us through Boiling Springs PA which was a beautiful little town. They were stocking the local lake with trout, so there were a lot of people out fishing. We passed Carlisle PA and just down the trail from there we ran into Maria and Gary. They were some locals out for a first date hike/picnic. They invited us to join them, and they shared what they had brought, with us. We ate summer sausage, fruits, meats, nuts, and cheese. This is what we call trail magic, and it sure made our day. We ended the day at a shelter with a privy nicknamed ""Taj Mahal."" It was called this because it was so big. It was about as large as my apartment in Korea.","Alex Kennedy Shelter
",Darlimgton Shelter,"Apr 28, Fri",18.20
Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563150,"We left out this morning and about 2 miles into our walk we came across some more trail magic. A couple had left a cooler full of water, sodas, and snack packages which contained oreos, nutter butters, and some crystal light packages. We stopped in Duncannon PA at the Doyle Hotel which is a staple of the AT. However, the place is a dump. We paid 10 dollars for a shower, and the showers were nasty. But, even so it felt great to have a hot shower as it had been a week or so since our last one. After showering we did laundry at the local laundromat. Since the Doyle was so nasty we decided to push on a few more miles to the next shelter. Even though it meant a steep climb out of town. The trail always descends into towns and you always have to climb back out. We also resupplied in Duncannon so our packs were a bit heavier.","Darlington Shelter
",Clarks Ferry Shelter,"Apr 29, Sat",15.60
Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563151,"Today once again the trail was full of rocks. Pennsylvania is full of rocks. I believe the AT brings you across every rock in the state. There is a saying that Pennsylvania is where hiking boots go to die. We have about 70 miles of PA left and so far my hiking shoes are holding up, but the rocks have torn holes in the tops and sides of both shoes. We'll see how many more miles I get out of them. We met a 71 year old through hiker today named ""Go."" He was a fit man carrying a light pack, and we couldn't keep up with him! The mosquitoes were bad last night so I was itching all day. Tonight we just camped in the woods as the next shelter was too far away, which meant no privy, which meant I had to dig my first cathole.","Clarks Ferry Shelter
",Campsite,"Apr 30, Sun",13.10
Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563153,"Today we hiked to another campsite along the trail as the distance to the first shelter was too short, and the distance to the second shelter was too great. It was a rainy morning but the weather cleared up for us during the afternoon. The hiking today was fairly easy. At the end of the day we were camping near a road that wasn't too far from a Mcdonalds according to my guide book. So we decided to walk to the road and see if we could hitch in to it. It didn't even take a minute and we had a ride from a local handyman named Randy. He was on his way to town to pick up flowers for his wife, so he dropped us off and picked us up on his way home and took us back to our campsite. So far hitchhiking has really easy for us. I hope it keeps up this way! We got rained on over night in our tents, but everything remained dry inside the tents.","Campsite

We met him in the Shenandoah's at the start of the hike and he was getting off trail for a few days, and then hiking with his wife. So we moved on, but for the past few weeks he has been walking 20-30 miles each day and he finally caught us. We stayed with him tonight in the shelter but he was getting up at 4am to do 40 miles with his trail friend ""Johnny Tsunami."" So it is highly unlikely we will see him again. Tonights shelter was four sided and enclosed which was nice. There was a caretaker who lived in the house beside it. There was also electricity to charge your things. A real first class shelter.

Then a little further down the trail they had put apples on top of cans of PBR. Sweet! The trail was once again very rocky and our feet are starting to feel it. Sometimes for a mile or so you are walking on trail that is nothing but small, pointy, sharp rocks that sting when you step on them. Other times it's a quarter mile stretch of gigantic rocks that you have to jump across from one to the other. For the past 2 days we have sheltered with two guys in their 70's who are a pretty funny duo. It always nice to have good company at shelters for the dowm time.","501 shelter

We also ran into ""Bigbird"" who has a Youtube channel(Steve Walker check it out) that my mom has been following. She said we were close to him and sure enough we finally met him. He chatted with us for a while and made a little video clip of us that should go onto his channel. The trail again was veeeery rocky. Almost the whole 9 miles. The last mile or so was very steep downhill. Today we finished in Hamburg PA but before we got there the trail ran through Port Clinton PA. We ran into the 2 guys from Texas at the Port Clinton Hotel where we had planned to eat. We ordered our food and ate and when we went to pay we discovered the 2 Texans had paid for our meal. It's amazing how many kind folks we have come across on the trail. Gotta love all the trail magic! We checked into our hotel and then walked over to the walmart to resupply.

I bought fudge rounds for breakfast, summer sausage, cheese and cookie butter for lunch, and macaroni and cheese with tuna packets for dinner. I also bought a big bag of M and M's.

It was a mistake because convenience store food is more pricey than food from the grocery store. It cost $58 for 2 days of food when it has normally been adding up to $30 or less. Seven and half miles of trail were closed due to recent wildfires. The wildfires bring out the rattlesnakes. Skipping these miles will not jeopardize our thru hike as it was a trail decision. I plan to return after settling in NY and hike the section we missed. We caught a ride with a local who took us around the closed area. That ride took about 10 minutes. If we had walked it would have taken 3 1/2 hours he said.

So I waited by the road and finally a car came by and was kind enough to pick me up. The local restaurant had prime rib on sale for 16 bucks so I had to go for that. It was only my 2nd steak on trail and it was delicious! Supposedly ME gets better in about 60 or so miles. We will see!","Speck Pond Shelter

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570222,This morning it was raining so I got off to a late start around 9am. I still encountered 1 rain storm after I started hiking. The trail was muddy and wet all day. I started to get some blisters around my ankles from wet socks. The trail over Old Blue Mountain was the worst I have seen. Full of mud and nowhere to step around it. I had had enough after climbing it and set up my tent. I spilled my dinner but had an extra one so it was ok. It started raining right after I got into my tent for the night.,"Andover

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570224,"Today was the first actual decent day in Maine. The trail wasn't too bad and the ascents and descents were on normal trail, not rock scrambles or anything. My blisters did continue to get worse as I went. I planned to finish in Rangely ME but stopped 4 miles short because my blisters hurt. I'm in the SOBO bubble now meaning I'm passing many people traveling the trail southbound.","Campsite

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570225,"Today was a tough day because my blisters were hurting pretty badly all day. I had to climb three steep mountains today Saddleback, The Horn, and Saddleback JR. They were all above tree line and offered some decent views when they weren't in clouds. I had planned a 24 mile day but stopped at the shelter 8 miles earlier because of my feet. Tonight there were about 9 sobo hikers that came into the shelter. Uggh. I haven't had to worry about crowded shelters until now.","Campsite

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570228,"This morning I taped my ankles real well and put moleskin over the blisters. I knew I wanted to make it to Stratton but also knew it was 21 miles. I had 3 or 4 big climbs for the day. In the morning I put on a podcast that was over 3 hours long. These are great to hike to and before I knew it 10 miles were already knocked out. The tape held up all day and my ankles didn't  hurt too badly. The last 5 miles were downhill, but when I started off down the mountain a hailstorm came through. I got hailed on for about 20 minutes and the trail looked like it had snowed. When I got to the road that led to Stratton there was a truck sitting in the parking lot. A guy got out and asked if I needed a ride. Turns out he saw the hailstorm come through and decided to sit out by the trail and see if any hikers would come through needing a ride. Lucky me! Time for a zero day tomorrow to let these blisters heal up.","Poplar Ridge Lean To

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570837,"Today I hiked out nice and rested up. I finished up the last tough climbs of Maine except for a mountain or two. The views from Bigelow Mountain were awesome and the weather was nice. At the shelter I stayed at there was a guy from Morganton who knew how to say ""Churville"" correctly. I tented at the shelter because the bugs are so bad. I don't remember the last time I actually slept in a shelter because of the bugs. Maybe Vermont.","Stratton motel

There weren't really any climbs but it was slow going because of the wet trail. My shin is still hurting so it is slowing me down after about 10 miles. The mosquitoes in Maine are no joke, and even rain doesn't keep them at bay.","Little bigelow lean to

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570839,Today I got to the Kenebec River amd had to take a canoe across. The ATC contracts out a company that does runs from 9-2 everyday. After the crossing I came to the city of Caratunk where a B&B is right off the trail. The place is famous for its milkshakes so I decided to stop by amd have one. Well my shin was still sore and I was feeling tired so I decided to stay. I went to dinner with some sobos and it was funny to get a newbies perspective of the trail. I tried not to make the trail sound too hard for them.,"Pierce Pond Lean To

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570842,"Today started off with a nice breakfast at the hostel. I ate a lot of french toast and potatoes as well as some sausage. The trail wasn't too bad today but had ine climb up to Moxie Bald Mountain. The top of the mountain is barren because of a fire in the early 1900's. It offered some pretty good views, and ended up not being too bad of a climb. The shelter was just down the other side of the mountain and was located right next to a pond. I wad hoping to see a moose but no luck.","Caratunk B&B

Nephew,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570843,Today's hike involved fording 3 streams. None of them were difficult and they were only about knee deep. Glad I'm not vertically challenged. The trail was not too difficult today but it was super muddy and my feet were wet all day. I didn't even bother to take my shoes off for the last ford because they were already so wet. When I got to the road today I couldn't hitch a ride so I had my mom(homebase) call the hostel to come get me as I could only text. The hostel is nice and there are some good folks staying here. My shin is still hurting so I will let it rest up for another day tomorrow.,"Moxie Bald Shelter

I also have a package at the PO I can't pick up until tomorrow because it's closed for the 4th. Some people at the hostel have some fireworks so tonight should be fun. Tomorrow I will head into the 100 mile wilderness which will take me 6 days and on the 7th day I will summit Katahdin which will be July 11th. A little later then expected but I've needed these rest days for my shin. I'm looking forward to finishing Maine so I can get to Virginia and start hiking some eaiser terrain and put in some bigger miles. Maine is beautiful but I don't ever wamt to hike here again!,"Shaw's Hostel
