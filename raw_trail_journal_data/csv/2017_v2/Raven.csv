Raven,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519704,"I grew up near the trail and was never far from it's reach in NY. It's been a dream of mine for awhile now and I decided next year will be my thru hike of the A.T. I will be 26 then and by the time I reach Maine, it will be my three year craniversary. May 20, 2014 I had brain surgery to remove a tumor from my cerebellum. The trail will be extra hard on me as I have ataxia, double vision and nystagmus-but I love the A.T and will be walking for my own recovery as well as raising awareness for TBI and ABI survivors/brain injuries. www.facebook.com/ATThruRaven",,Planning,"Jan 15, Fri",0

Also in sad news I broke my 100$ carbon fiber trekking pole and apparently I smell awful <3

I wish I could go ultra light, but I just cant figure that out : need to have a notebook and a book to read on the trail. I'm still waiting for my 2017 NOBO trail guide book, but it's nice to have been training with my 2013 guide. I guess that was the year the trail began to call me- just took awhile to hear.

Raven,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553971,"Over the weekend I gave my two weeks notice at work (Tractor Supply) and with leaving in less then a month for Georgia- I'm counting down the days. During my walk I aim to raise awareness and support for people with brain injuries (TBI's & ABI's), caregivers and research. I spent 9 days in the hospital after my surgery and needed months of outpatient and inpatient care during my recovery (which is still ongoing). My family and I were completely unprepared with what a brain injury means. In a moment my life changed and we needed help. Everyone thought - I survived- great - done. No.A brain injury is forever- recovery is ongoing. Although we may look fine, although I may hike mountains - my struggle in constant. I'm really hoping to share this story on my thru hike from Georgia to Maine. I'm hoping to explain a little better and help others see- we are not invisible. 
My goal is to raise at least one dollar for every mile I walk (over two thousand) to the organizations which have and continue to help me and thousands of others.

Raven,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555325,"Took the train from Bedford to NYC, then Amtrak at Penn Station. I had lunch in Bryant park and had a lady at the train station ask me for money. Honestly she was not short fifty dollars for her ticket and I told her sorry I have no money . And nothing compares to a sixteen plus hour train ride- train added time in the Carolinas, plus I was the only one to leave in Gainesville. The conductor asked are you walking the trail and I nodded. Yes I am. He put down a stool for me to exit (no platform) and I was on my way. Because my train was late my shuttle was too, I walked over to the Big Bear Cafe and sat down at the counter on a barstool. Oh my gosh, everyone was so nice, I was their first thru hiker and they paid for my meal. Amazing gravy,biscuit, toast and sweet tea. I'm so glad my train was late. Hiker hostel shuttle picked me up around 1030 and I'm here now exploring outside with their dog. The mountains in Georgia are amazing. I start the trail tomorrow!

As we get closer to the smokies it's surreal how many thru hikers will and have already stepped off trail. Yes it's been hard (Albert Mountain), it's rained, snowed, I've been seperated from my friends, lost food to the ground - but I have never been happier and there is no place I would rather be. The other day JW said to me, you have already changed so much, now you look us in the eyes. I do think. No I know. This trail and the people here have already made me a stronger, better person.

Raven,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568851,"Flip Flopping back down started off with a fun road trip from CT-ME. We were running late for the bus from Bangor, I had to drop off the rental car while Nomad bribed the bus driver with $5 and a Snapple Apple. I then ran a mile to the bus which waited ten minutes, just for me. Then at Medway we failed to get a hitch and had to pay too much for a shuttle- turns out there was a crazy storm and all the power was lost in Millinocket. We arrived in the pitch dark at night to the hostel and stayed in the Springer Room. Katahdin was the hardest mountain I've ever climbed post surgery. It took me 16 hours and we arrived back down at 2am - amazing hike though. We had the sign all to ourselves- it was magical. Zero days for awhile for recovery and I need to buy new hiking shorts- mine are torn to pieces. Katahdin literally kicked my ass and I wouldn't have it any other way.Facebook.com/atthruraven","
