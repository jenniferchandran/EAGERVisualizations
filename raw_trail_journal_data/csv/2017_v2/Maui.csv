Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554129,"Section hiking in Pennsylvania in January and February. Trying to get some miles in before I start my thru hike in March. Weather is cooperating so far. The goal is to get Pennsylvania done (230 miles) before the thru hike starts. So far I've been to the trail 3 times - first two times were long weekends and currently have been here for over a week. 
First trip with Rainbow and brother Johnny we stayed in Fayetteville at Scottish Inn and Suites. Started at the Mason Dixon line and hiked a total of 24.2 in 3 days. Visited Gettysburg a couple of times.
Next trip - 2 weeks later - was just me and Rainbow and we stayed in Carlisle at Country Inn and Suites. Now we have a hot tub and a free hot breakfast which is excellent! Hiked for three days and got in another 25.4 miles. Experienced a lot of ice when we hiked the Rock Maze and that slowed us down. We started using Uber to pick us up at the car and take us to the start of our hike each day - works out great and allows me and Rainbow to walk together. Walked through Boiling Springs which is a nice little town.
Fast forward two weeks and Rainbow and I are back in Carlisle at Country Inn and Suites (love the hot tub at the end of each hike). First day we hiked into Duncannon and I got my first passport stamp at the Doyle Hotel! Hiked down around Caledonia State Park and completed the AT through to Duncannon. Got another passport stamp at Boiling Springs. Rainbow dropped me off further north and I met my nephew Allen and we hiked near Lickdale. Rainbow had to go home. Staying in Country Inn and Suites in Frackviile and brother John is joining me. We hiked from 225 into Duncannon and then back north the next day - knife edge was fun! Staying the next three days in Drums with my nephew and tackling Lehigh Furnace Gap. Currently about 106 miles done.","Mason Dixon line (Maryland/Pennsylvania border)

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554153,"Today we tackled Lehigh Gap! I've read about it, I've seen pictures of it, but never have I experienced anything like it! You basically hike 1 mile up a shear cliff. I was totally uncomfortable looking down so I just kept crawling straight up the cliff. I feel like this hike is preparing me for the Whites! All three of us made it - my nephew Allen and my brother Johnny - now trail named ""Hot Tub"" since he really wants to get in one after every hike!
After getting to the top, the rest of the hike was pretty normal (in comparison). Stopped in Danielsville and completed 4.8 miles today.","Palmerton, PA

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554258,"Last day to hike today - going home tomorrow. Me and my nephew started where we left off yesterday and hiked from South Gap Road to Smith Gap Road. We hiked near a ski resort and had about 100 yards of snow. Met a couple of kids who were camping overnight but they were almost out of water. My nephew made a little trail magic and gave them a bottle of water!Of course the trail was rocky, but we made good time and hiked 7.3 miles. My total is right at 120 miles thus far.Time to belly up to some wings and watch the Super Bowl!","

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554848,"Back to Rocky PA! They got 9"" of snow last week and it still hasn't melted. Friday, Maui and Rainbow hiked into Wind Gap - starting at Smith Gap Road. It was very snowy. We started in icy conditions and then graduated to snowy conditions. Thankfully there was a set of boot prints that we could walk in. Sometimes the snow was as deep as 12"" - very difficult to navigate. The 8-mile walk took us 6 hours.
Saturday my nephew Allen went with us and we started at Wind Gap and walked to Fox Gap. Again, lots of ice, snow and then slippery slush. We unlayered as the day went on - it got a little north of 60 degrees. We made our way through Wolf Rock which was a little hairy with the snow/ice, but was pretty cool. The descent to the car was ""snowless"" (finally) and steep with no switch backs. The 8.5 miles took us 5 hours and 45 minutes - so slow going.
Sunday Maui, Rainbow and Allen went to Bake Oven Knob and hiked to Lehigh Gap. The drive up to Bake Oven Knob was steep and very muddy. We were four wheeling in a Camry! The first 2-1/2 miles were boulder fields and lots of rocks. We did lots of butt slides and teetering. The powerline field which is usually an open field, was a boulder field. Otherwise, the weather was beautiful and we were in the sun pretty often which was a treat vs. always being in the trees. Temperature got up to 64 degrees and there was no snow today (YAY!). Will post pictures soon.
IMPORTANT NOTE: On 2/19/17 Rainbow found a tick on her. It had bit but had died. Way too early for that!!","Rocky PA

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556498,"They finally made it to Neel's Gap - four days to get there. The weather has been brutal. Bruce's phone said 1 degree this morning. The wind has been howling. It's been rough to say the least. There is no ""resting"" because they get cold so fast and you have to keep moving. They've been hit on the head with sticks, ice and snow - lol. Bruce thinks he may have frost bite on his finger. Coming down Blood Mountain was snowy and icy. Filtering water required no gloves and could only get about 2 inches in the water bottle before fingers went numb. Today they had to stick their tongue in their water bottle to make a hole because the water was freezing. Crazy!!! Nights have been OK in the tent - stayed warm. The view from Blood Mountain was amazing - so clear with blue skies and snow. Too cold to get the camera out often - more pictures in the future.The good news is that they made it to Neel's Gap and hitched a free ride with an awesome couple that took them into Blairsville. They are staying at a Best Western and they have heat...and a shower....and a beautiful bed. Weather is supposed to be even worse tonight. Most all the hikers are getting off the trail. They're taking a zero day tomorrow and letting the weather improve. 30's at night is going to feel like summertime!Bob is rethinking his food. Intended not to cook but eat sardines, tuna packs, etc. Borrowed some Ramen noodles from Bruce last night and the warm food revived him. He may be sending some of his resupply items home as he's going shopping for some hot meals. Laundry tomorrow and backpack restock. That awesome couple that brought them into Blairsville offered to take them back to Neel's Gap on Thursday morning. Their first trail magic!Penned by Rainbow for Maui","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556651,"Zero day today. Weather is definitely improving. They had a hot breakfast, did some shopping, did some laundry and started watching the NCAA tournament games. Back to Neel's Gap in the morning. Maui did his laundry in his rain pants, coat and boots with no socks. Hot baths and Bengay to ease the hip pain. They've had to get in their tents for 13-14 hours at night to escape the howling wind and cold and too long laying on hard ground (even with a mat) makes the hips hurt. Hopefully the weather will allow them to stay out longer, linger by the fire, have a cup of coffee and spend less time in the tent. Bruce was ready to walk the 2-1/2 miles to Walmart for supplies but Maui said ""I'll just go across the street to the grocery and catch up to you later"". Turns out Bruce didn't go either but he did ""need to move"" and did some shopping/errands while Maui chilled in his nice, warm and comfy hotel room - lol. Maui did get him some Ramen noodles so he'll have a hot meal on the next trek.","Neel's Gap

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556717,Back on the trail today - much better weather. Started at Neel's Gap and made it to Low Gap Shelter area - about 11.5 miles today with a late start - not bad! Maui passed four other hikers - first time! Weather makes a big difference. Get those hiker legs Maui!!,"Neel's Gap

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556939,"Started out yesterday at Low Gap Shelter and made it to Unicoi Gap. Low Gap Shelter had about 40 hikers - 8 fires going at once. Weather started out misty and foggy in the morning but the sun came out around 2:00 and it started to warm up. Decided not to camp at Blue Mountain Shelter and went down to Unicoi Gap to get out of the wind. Just Bruce and Maui camping together last night. Made about 9.7 miles. Got down to about 32 degrees.
Today they started out climbing 1,000 feet up Rocky Mountain and then climbed Tray Mountain and are camping at Sassafras Gap - hiked just under 10 miles. They've only got 6.6 miles tomorrow and then going to a hotel in Helen, GA to resupply and clean up. The hotel has a hot tub!! Zero day on Tuesday and back at it on Wednesday.","Low Gap Shelter

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557065,"Hiked about 6.5 miles into Dicks Creek Gap. Walked about 1/2 mile to Top of Georgia Hostel & Hiking Center to get their resupply boxes and a ride into Helen, GA. A fireman from Norwood, Ohio was there grilling up hot dogs and he had beer!!! Trail magic is the best! Then they got to meet the famous Miss Janet - hiker caretaker! After several pictures and some helpful guidance, she gave them a ride into Helen to their hotel. So far the highlight of the trip! They are tucked away for some down time - back on the trail Wednesday.","Unicoi Gap

Maui,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557675,"Unfortunately, due to a toe injury, Maui had to come home. The injury will not allow him to do enough miles per day. He's home to see a doctor to see about getting it fixed and hopes to get back out there. There is not a word to describe how bad this sucks. It was an extremely difficult decision to make. Total miles thus far in 2017 is 222.","Dick's Creek GAp
