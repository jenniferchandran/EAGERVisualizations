Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554469,"I love being in the woods. The walking in the woods seems to clear my mind. The air is fresh and clean. (Except when it rains.) And it rains a lot. In walking the long trail, I know that to be successful you have to embrace the suck. By that I mean you have to enjoy the rain. And the cold. And the wind. And malfunctioning gear. And soreness. What I really like about hiking the Appalachian Trail is the challenge. The physical challenge of day after day. The mental challenge of missing friends and loved ones. I hope that my son and I are up for the challenges. Either way, I'm thankful for the opportunity to go. Most dads don't get the privilege of hiking every day with their son. I am Grateful 2.",,i love the woods,"Feb 11, Sat",0
Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554666,"Only 4 and 1/2 weeks till we leave. I'm telling people now that we are hiking the trail. I guess there's no turning back now. I know we will have a great time, but I also know it will be one of the hardest things we will have ever done. Will we make it? I can't be sure.I've had lingering foot issues. My right foot has undergone 5 major surgeries with plates, screws, and fusions. My left foot has developed plantar faciitis in the last year that required a cortisone shot and extensive rehab. Both of my shoulders have been replaced. Besides that, I'm getting older and can't do what I used to do. Will we make it? I don't know.I called someone close to me today who knows I hike the AT and have had foot issues. I wanted to tell them about the hike. I told them that my son and I were ""thru"" hiking the Appalachian Trail. They wanted to know what had brought that on. They wanted to know why I was finished hiking! I said, ""No, I'm not finished hiking. I'm thru-hiking. I am walking the Appalachian Trail all the way from Georgia to Maine."" LOL They said, ""No way."" I hope there is a way. Even if I am only able to go part of the way, I am still Grateful 2 B here.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Sun",0
Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555211,"It's Sunday. So we went to church like we always do, at least while we are here at home. I wonder what Sundays will be like on the trail? I wonder if I'll get together with some of the other hikers and talk about God? Or maybe Sunday will become just another day. It's almost gotten that way in our society now. I wish it wasn't that way. So anyway, it's Sunday and we went to church. Yesterday I posted on my Facebook account that Gooseman and I were hiking the Appalachian Trail. Lots of people wanted to talk to me today about my trip. I got all the usual questions. How long will you be gone? Are you walking the whole way? Will you be sleeping in a tent? Where will you get food? Will you be ""packing"" (a gun)? What about the Bears?I answered each question with as much enthusiasm as I could because I am excited about going. It's good to know that some of the people in our church are excited for us in this new adventure.No one asked me the big question however. Why am I going? I'm not sure I can answer that myself either. It's almost like the mountains are calling to me. It's something I must do. I love being outside. I love the endorphin release I get when I hike long distances. It's something I've known I must do for over 20 years. Now this is my chance. I don't want to waste it. Eighteen days till we leave.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555254,"A shakedown hike - it's sort of a practice hike. You go on a one or two night hike with all your gear to see if what you have is going to work. Does your stove fire up and cook your food efficiency? Is your sleeping bag warm enough? Is your pack comfortable? (That's relative because a 25-30 pound pack is never completely comfortable.) Are your shoes going to cause blisters? Are you in shape enough to make it? Things like that. Our shakedown hike was planned for today and tomorrow. I say ""was"". Plans change. Last week Gooseman started feeling bad. He went to the doctor and tested positive for Strep. So he is in the bed trying to recover, and the shakedown hike won't be this week. And yesterday I started feeling bad. Went to the doctor this morning, and yep, I've got Strep also. Now I'm sitting at Walmart waiting on my prescriptions. Not a part of my AT plan. However, I'm glad it happened while we were at home and not out on the trail. I wonder how we will handle being sick out on the trail? Most of the people I hear from who have thru hiked the trail have gotten some sort of illness or injury during the hike. Blisters or norovirus or Lymes disease or a twisted ankle. Think about it. In the ""real world"", haha, most people don't go six months without getting some sort of illness, even if it's just a cold. And what do they do? Usually they suck it up, go to work, and do the best they can. Sometimes you have to take time off and go to the doctor. I guess that's what we'll do on the trail, too. It's not part of the plan, we just keep going. So there may not be a shakedown hike after all, but we will keep going. After all, isn't that part of what hiking the AT is about? Just keep going. Put one foot in front of the other. Persevere. And be grateful2 as you are going.",,Shakedown hike?,"Feb 27, Mon",0
Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555596,"I'm sitting on the back porch of our home in Chattanooga overlooking the Cumberland Valley. It's a beautiful view. God has created an incredible world. I can't wait to explore it on foot.Only 13 days till I leave. I'm finally starting to feel better after a week of strep. It knocked me down. I've done nothing but lay around in the bed for a week. I was getting in shape but now nothing. I'm definitely not ready to hike 10 miles a day at this point. I've decided not to postpone my hike though. I guess I'll just get in shape on the trail. Not the best plan, but is the one I'm going to roll with. I still have a few days to do some walking but I recognize it won't be enough. I'm reading everyone's trail journals and getting excited. I'm also noticing that several of the people I have been following have already gotten off the trail by Blairsville. It's an awful lot planning, sacrifice and work to just last five or six days. People do get hurt however, And things do come up. I hope I make it farther than that. God has a plan, and I'll find out what it is in a few days. And I'm grateful2.",,feeling better,"Mar 04, Sat",0
Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556090,"We've been trying to get ready for the task ahead by hiking with a full pack. Five miles a day on the Cumberland trail three times this week. It's probably not enough for me to be completely ready, but it's enough to keep me sore. I'm still trying to recover from strep last week, and trying to get my multi-surgery bad foot to cooperate and not swell. Only one more week! It's hard not to live ""in the meantime"". Even though we are leaving in a week, there are still so many things do around the house until then. Replanted grass, fertilized the yard, sprayed for insects around the house, finished taxes, and so many other things keep the days busy. It's too easy to just look forward to leaving and not focus on what has to be done today. I'm looking forward to hiking in a week, but I need to have joy in living here for another week. I'm really going to miss my wife for six months!Some people live their whole life like that - ""one day"". One day when I finish high school. One day when I graduate college. One day when I get married. One day when I retire. That's not a good way to live. You turn around a few times and life is over. Plans are important but so is living today to its fullest. There is joy in the destination, but there is also joy in the journey. I hope that our AT hike has both. I want to enjoy each day, the sunshine and the rain, but also I want to enjoy summitting Mt Katahdin. Completing the challenge of each day and completing the challenge of six months. I'm grateful 2 for the opportunity.",,one day,"Mar 11, Sat",0
Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556410,"Only three more days till we leave. Still lots of things to do. Sacrifices have to be made in order to be gone for six months. One of those sacrifices has to do with personal hygiene. Long hair can't be washed regularly, so the long hair is gone. Not that it was long before, but it is really short now.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556753,"Leaving in the morning. Ready to go. Supposed to pour down rain. I guess it won't be the last time we get rained on. Wonder how long it will take to get used to it?Drove over to my brother's house this afternoon. He lives about thirty minutes from Springer Mountain. We are enjoying their company. He took us out to a great BBQ joint for what he called our ""last meal"". We had the big combo platters. A lot of food, and good, good, good! Our first trail magic, and we don't even start till in the morning. Thanks Kevin and Tammie. I tried to explain to him and his wife about how we will kill the AYCE restaurants along the trail. Hiker appetites are the stuff legends are made of. We are watching the NCAA basketball tourney. I love the win or go home pressure. This may be the first year I will miss most of the tournament since I was a kid. I think I'd rather be hiking though. . The journey instead of the tourney. Tomorrow the journey starts.","

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556896,"Random thoughts from the first day on the trail:1. I am so thankful to be out here. This is something I have wanted to do since I was a teenager. I am thankful that my son gets to experience it with me. He seems to be having a good time so far. Time will tell. 2. My often surgically-repaired foot held up for the nine plus mile hike with no apparent problems. 3. I miss my wife already. She's my best friend. I so wanted her to go with us, but it is just not her thing. She walked the mile up and mile back from the parking lot to the top of Springer to wish us Godspeed and to say goodbye. She is a trooper. 4. The hike today was good, except for all the crowds. People everywhere! They should rename the Appalachian trail the Cattle Trail. We must have seen three or four hundred people on the trail today. They say the crowds will thin out in the next fifty miles. There is so much foot traffic that the trail is a mud slip and slide in most places. I almost fell twice. Gooseman did fall hard once. He came up covered in mud but was otherwise unhurt. It Will probably be the first of many for us both. 5. More trail magic today. Someone left Gatorade energy bars on a footbridge hand railing with a sign that said ""trail magic"". Thank you to that angel. 6. If you are following us, please take a minute and sign the guestbook. Thank you to all of you who already have signed it. 7. Hope you like the picture from the Visitors center. We figured it was the fastest way to travel the trail. I have no cell service down in Hawk Mountain Gap, so I will post this when service comes back.","Springer Mountain

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556972,"Met a lot of great people on the trail today. Stewart is an early 30 something teacher on leave from England. We talked about a lot of the trail customs on the Appalachian Trail which are very different from how they do things in England. He was amazed that no one uses detailed maps here; they just follow the blazes to the next place.We met one young man from the Netherlands. He speaks English, Dutch, and a little German. Amazing.We met Tom the ridge runner. His responsibility is to show up at the shelter we are staying in tonight and make sure everything is going OK. He did a great job helping almost 50 hikers to get situated in the shelter and at tent sites.We have chosen at this point not to stay in the shelters. They are dirty, overcrowded, and full of mice. Everyday after a full day of hiking we are setting up hammocks. That means we have to hang a hammock, set up a rain fly, put out a sleeping bag, hang an underquilt, and unpack. Then we have to go get and filter 2 gallons of water, get out our stove and pots and cook supper, eat, and clean up from cooking. Then in the morning we have to break everything down and pack it up. Then we have to get in enough miles hiking so that we can get to Maine before the bad fall weather sets in. Makes for full days. When we got up this am it was colder than I expected. My thermometer said 25 degrees. It warmed up during the day to maybe 65, which made for a beautiful day of hiking. So warm, in fact, that both Gooseman and I got sunburned. From 25 freezing degrees to sunburn, and we were outside for al of it! Still grateful 2.","hawk mountain tenting

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557074,"Beautiful day for a hike today. Up-and-down the mountains seeing the splendor of Gods creation. It is awe-inspiring to imagine the one who created all that we see and enjoy. The attached picture is of preachers rock looking out over the Blue Ridge Mountains at an elevation of 3700 feet. The picture doesn't do it any justice. We met a nice mother and daughter team,Amanda and ""Mother"" Mary out hiking for the day. The daughter wants to hike the whole AT beginner my next spring. I could see the fire in her eyes to do it. That is the kind of person who finishes all 2190 miles. They gave us energy bars! More trail magic. When I am hiking, Mornings always start out with such potential and energy. On long and difficult days, that potential gets lost somewhere along the way and each minute just becomes about putting 1 foot in front of the other. Today was such a day. Walking in the outdoors is enjoyable. Walking in the outdoors up and down 1000 foot elevation gains and losses can be hard. Walking in the outdoors up and down 1000 foot elevation gains and losses with a 35 pound pack can be downright difficult sometimes. Today was such a day. My legs ache, my knees hurt, my back kept cramping, my feet burned, but still we kept walking. I was so glad to finally get to the campsite for the evening. We had a good meal and some great fellowship with other hikers. Tomorrow we will get up before the sun and do it again. Are we crazy or what? My son says he's having a great time. Tomorrow we get to Neels gap where there are pizzas and hot wings awaiting. Boy are we ready! We are Grateful 2 be here.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557264,"Today was a day for big adventure. An anticipated climb over Blood Mountain with the reward of real food at the end of the descent. The morning started with a spectacular sunrise. The climb toward Blood mountain had more challenge than we expected but we finally made the base of the mountain at the aptly named Slaughter Creek. As we summitted the Mountain the view was better than we expected! Spectacular! There is an old stone shelter at the very top which would have been nice to stay in, but the ATC has mandated bear canisters for this short stretch. No self-respecting thru hiker would ever carry a canister because of the weight. 
The descent down to Neel Gap was a brutal rock scramble. I had done this years ago and remembered that it was difficult, but I had not remembered it as this difficult. I must be getting old! More on this later. 
I had heard that it was supposed to rain so I was able to find two other hikers, Dillon and Tyler, to share a cabin for the night. More on this later also. As an aside, as we walked in the howling wind Gooseman me their names, I told him ""Tyler like Texas"". Gooseman said back to me, ""His name is Texas? Cool.""
We rented the cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins, and boy were we glad we did. We were hit a few hours later with a horrific storm. Heavy rains, marble sized hail, fierce winds, lightning and thunder. It would have been tough in the outdoors tonight. I wondered how my newfound friends fared?
Let me back up a moment and talk about our arrival at Neel Gap. There is a full service outfitter here with everything the hiker needs. They do ""pack shakedowns"" where they help the hikers decide what they do and don't need to help them to be successful. I have been hiking enough that I didn't think I needed a shakedown, but I did need to pick up a couple of things, take care of a pack issue, and resupply some food. I went inside and found a nice salesman who took the time to help me with everything I needed. He spent a considerable amount of time with me even though the store was crowded. He helped me find everything I needed. When I went to check out I found out he was the owner! Logan, you rock and so does Mountain Crossing! I saw you and your staff really help a lot of thru hikers today.","Lance Creek

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557284,"The storm took its toll on the hikers last night. At least two hikers had their tent poles snapped in half. Dozens of hikers had standing water in their tents during night. Tents blown over. Several had their tarps ripped by high winds. The hikers today were consistently estimating winds of near 50 miles an hour last night. Many hikers were visibly shaken, but no one was hurt. Glad I was in a cabin last night. As we started down the trail this morning, Gooseman said to me, "" My knees are hurting bad."" Not good. He never complains about his body hurting so i knew it must be bad. I asked him when they started hurting. ""After we finished the rock scramble down Blood Mountain yesterday."" Uh oh. I looked at them closely. Not swollen but sore to the touch. Seemed to be the worst just either side of his patella tendon. I had him stretch, and then I massaged them. Not much help. Bad knees can end a hike. We had planned to hike 11 miles today. The first mile took us over an hour. Usually Gooseman is bounding down the trail; his six foot three, two hundred thirty pound frame leaving me in his dust at 2-3 miles an hour. Not today. We are supposed to meet my wife at Dicks Creek Gap on Saturday, but we needed to make the miles for it to happen. 6 miles today, and they were very painful for Gooseman. Uh oh. The plan now is to try to make it to Unicoi in two days and the wife will meet us there. She can take us to a motel in Hiawassee and Gooseman can rest his knees for a couple of days. I hope he can walk on them tomorrow. He's really loving the hike so far, and then this. Tomorrow will be a better day, and I'm Grateful2.","neel gap

They, along with many other mountain wildflowers, are starting to emerge from the soil here. It won't be but a few days and the Trail will be ablaze in color. Interesting fact about the rattlesnake orchids. Native American Indian women believed that if they rubbed it on themselves that it made a man fall more deeply in love with them. Im taking orders guys! Not really! It does signal the beginning of spring though. We made eight miles today, trying to get back to civilization. We will be at Unicoi Gap tomorrow. Gooseman's knees are still not doing well so we are meeting my wife and taking a couple of days off for them to recuperate. I'll see if I can eat back all the calories I have lost so far.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557485,"We are warm and dry now, but today's weather up on Blue Mountain was brutal. Walking in 40 degree weather with 30-40 mph winds and rain and fog can be a good mixer for hypothermia. All the hikers we saw were walking with their heads down just putting one foot in front of the other. But we made it along with everyone else. Gooseman's knees are still bothering him a lot, so we found a hitch into Hiawassee. Kent Stewart from Flowery Branch, Ga. came up here to see if he could help some thru hikers, and boy did he help us. Turns out that we knew some of the same people from the north Atlanta area. Thanks   to Mr. Stewart from Wages and Sons funeral home. We are staying a couple of days in Hiawassee to see if Gooseman's knees will heal up. We had trail magic at Unicoi Gap today. Bob and Dave take one day every year to drive from Warner Robins, Ga. to provide food for thru hikers. (Bob and Dave are the two nearest the truck.)

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557580,"I cried. And I'm not a crier. I got up from the bed and went to the bathroom of this two-bit motel room where my wife, son, and I are staying and I cried some more so they wouldn't hear me. I cried hard. Gooseman has decided he's going home. His knees are hurting, he has a sinus infection, and he's decided to go home. I'll miss him so much but that's not why I'm crying. We've had a great week and shared a lot of laughs. It will be hard without him but that's not why I'm crying. I'm crying because I hurt for Gooseman. What many of you don't know about Gooseman is that he has autism. I've watched him his whole life not be accepted. I've watched him try so hard to be successful in life, and he struggles. He's doesn't have a job and he still lives at home. He's a good man with a great sense of humor, but he struggles. He's generous and loves giving to others. He always stands up for the underdog. On the trail, if he can walk, he's normal. I've watched him being accepted this week. I so wanted him to finish- to be accepted as a hiker. Not for me but for him. We had such fun picking out meals together, choosing campsites together,and enjoying trail magic together. I thought he had what it takes to make it, at least a good part of the way. I wanted him to make it more than I wanted to make it. Now it's over for Gooseman. How is it possible to want more for your son than you want for yourself? I've wanted this since I was 15 years old, but I'd gladly give it up if he could make it. I hope he can get to feeling better soon, and maybe we can work it out for him to rejoin me.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557706,"We woke up this morning at Mulls Inn in Hiawassee. We went to a great church service at McConnell Baptist Church. Then it was onto the AYCE buffet at Daniels Restaurant. Chicken, Turkey and dressing, roast beef, green beans, creamed corn, and hot banana pudding for dessert. I can eat anything I want and not gain weight! My wife and Gooseman had me to the trailhead by 12:30, and it was time to say goodbye again. I miss my wife and I miss having Gooseman with me. The trail today from Unicoi over Trey Mountain had elevation changes shaped just like an ""M"". Up, down, up, down. Not a 100 yard flat stretch the entire trail. The trail was well graded though, so the miles went quickly. Even though it was only 5.7 miles today, for the first time my feet and legs feel great. Maybe I am starting to get my trail legs?I traded out my hammock setup for one of my tents which my wife brought from home.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557797,"The ruffled grouse have started mating. Not that I've actually seen it, but I am hearing the male's mating call. It is loud. It sounds sort of like someone slowly starting an old piston engine. Whomp...whomp...whomp...whomp..whomp.whomp.whomp. It's loud. Funny, no one else on the trail seems to know what the noise is. It's freaking out some of the girls. When I tell them what the noise is, they can't believe it's a bird. Try describing what a ruffled grouse looks like. It doesn't look any other bird I know of. It's kind of like a giant quail or a little short-legged chicken. Anyway, it's another signal that spring is here. Another easy day today in terms of miles. They will get bigger very soon. I'm walking mostly by myself the last two days. I seem to be in a bubble of 18-25 year olds. I've only seen two other hikers over thirty since I left Unicoi. I'm walking by myself because I can't walk their speed. Even though a large percentage of AT hikers are in their fifties, they are not in my bubble. I start out early and the twenty somethings pass me all day, except for the ones who sleep till almost lunch before they start hiking. 1 1/2 to 2 miles an hour is as fast as I can go, and most of them pass me at 2 to 3 miles an hour. So I'm hiking by myself all day. I meet people at the shelters at night. We eat supper together and then it's everyone to bed before dark. The solitude can be refreshing sometimes. Walking alone and seeing the next ridge in front of you can be inspiring. The mountains are majestic when seen from a distance. They are tough when you are climbing them alone. It gives me a lot of time to think. Staying tonight at Deep Gap Shelter at 3456 elevation. The picture is of our food bags hanging. We hang our food bags every night to keep the varmits away.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557935,"Today's post is about weather. You really notice the weather when you're in it 24/7. The weather in the mountains is constantly changing. Last night a front came through and dumped at least an inch of rain on me in my tent. Heavy rain. Big drops. At one point it was raining cats and dogs. I know it was raining cats and dogs because one dog landed on the top of my tent and started peeing through the tent right on to my face. Annoying to say the least. It was a very small hole so I couldn't figure out where the water was coming from. But I must be a Methodist because I've definitely been sprinkled.After the rain stopped the wind began to blow – probably 30 miles an hour and it was a cold north wind. After I broke camp this morning, the wind stopped as a fog settled in with visibility of about 20 feet. Then by mid morning the fog had lifted and it was sunburn hot. Then by early afternoon the clouds had thickened and it was cool again. Then late this afternoon the sun came back out and it heated back up. Now I'm in my tent on the ridge where the wind is blowing at least 40 miles an hour, and I'm hoping that my tent won't implode on me. I walked my biggest day so far today, 12 1/2 miles. I'm in North Carolina now where I will be until I start into the smoky mountains. One down, 13 to go. And I'm grateful for the opportunity.","deep gap

The morning view as I climbed out of bly Gap was spectacular and made it worthwhile. You have to take the good with the bad out here, just like you have to in the real world. I'm staying tonight at Standing Indian. The stream where we get our water has a pool below where we are filtering. We all took turns soaking our feet in the cold water. It's amazing how much better my feet feel after an ice bath. One of the hikers with us is having shin and leg issues. It's causing him to go slower than he expected, and it will take him longer to get to a food resupply than he expected. He will run out of food, so all the hikers pitched in a little food so he will make it.

He got up almost at my feet and flew across the trail. His feathers made a lot of noise. Almost as much noise as a turkey I scared one time. As I watched him fly away quickly I thought there's not even time to get a picture of him.2. As I walk down the trail today I misstepped and I twisted my ankle. This was the ankle that I broke in high school and used to have a lot of problems with. For a moment I was very afraid. I thought, ""this could be the end of the hike."" I tested it for a moment, and it appeared to be OK. I kept walking and it's fine now. Out of 5 million steps that it takes to get to Mount Katahdin a thing as simple as one misstep could end it all. I don't want that surprise.3. As I walked up standing Indian mountain this morning the weather again surprised me. On my right was a thick fog bank. I couldn't see 50 feet in that direction. On my left it was perfectly clear. I could see three rows of mountains in the distance. I was caught in the middle between the fog and the sunshine. Surprised.4. I have been surprised by the size of last autumn's wildfire devastation. For the entire hike today I was walking through burned trees. The devastation is between three and 6 feet tall from he ground, turning the ground, fallen trees and everything else pitch black.5. My speed is increasing. I'm surprised that today it was over 2 miles an hour. That's what it will take to get to the end.6. As I was walking down the trail this morning, I looked ahead to notice a woman hiking south down toward me. I knew I had seen her before so I stopped a moment to talk. I said, ""Havent I seen you before?"" It's surprising to see the same person coming toward you multiple days in a row. She said maybe so. I found out that she and her husband are hiking the Appalachian Trail by doing what's called swapping keys. He drops her off on the north end of the trail they're going to hike for the day and he drives to the south end of the same trail. Then she walks back to the car while he walks to where she began from. She gets in the car and goes to meet him. Then they use the car to go stay in a motel for the night. They don't have to carry big packs and they get to hike the entire trail. A fun way to hike the trail. Surprising.Im grateful2.","standing indian

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558252,"Word travels fast on the trail. People pass their friends and have a quick conversation. Hikers meet at the shelters and talk. Word was traveling fast yesterday that there were going to be bad storms last night. I decided to spend last night in a shelter because my tent still has a leak I can't locate. I was among the first to arrive at Carter Gap shelter last night. The shelter is made for six people. We had seven on the platform and three more on the dirt floor under roof. We were full. After supper we turned away four or five who ended up tenting near the shelter. Then one guy about 20 showed up and announced that he had hiked almost twenty miles and he needed a spot in the shelter. He could see it was full, but kept insisting he needed a spot because he deserved it after hiking so far. From the back of the platform someone said, ""ok"", and the self- entitled hiker put down his pack and began to unpack. He talked and joked loudly after hiker midnight ( dark) when it is kind of assumed that everyone goes to bed. Most of the people are courteous and respecting of others, but a few seem to act like they are better than the rest because they hike faster or longer or are a thru-hiker. That was this guy. He was just better. We finally all went to sleep. This morning, the first thing I heard was, ""Oh f$&@, Oh sh$&! I did everything right and they got it anyway. I hung my G$&d&$@ foodbag just like I was supposed to and the f@&$ing mice got in it anyway. They chewed a hole in my bag and ate my food.""YES! Trail justice. It rained buckets last night. The shelter stayed dry. The morning ritual for most is to visit the privy (outhouse) when you wake up. This morning several hikers were standing around the table fixing their breakfast before they left. One of the hikers said, ""l was the first one in the privy this morning and it was dry. Someone could have slept in there last night and stayed dry."" One of the female hikers standing at the table said, ""It wasn't dry when I went in."" Then she realized what had happened. ""Eww"", she shrieked. Everyone laughed but no one took ownership. The trail is not the cleanest environment I've ever been in.","carter gap

There is anticipation before you get to the trail concerning what the trail will be like. Once you get on the trail, anticipation develops concerning what happens when you get off the trail. Many of the hikers on the AT seem to live for when they get to town. Some for partying, some for a real bed or shower, and some for cooked food. It almost seems funny to me that when we finally get out here, we are thinking about not being out here. We all anticipate when we get close to the roads out here. The roads bring change for us. First we notice the trail is descending. Then we hear the cars in the distance. Then we see the road. Anticipation. Sometimes the road is a ride into town. Sometimes it holds a trail angel who has set up a hamburger feed. For me today it is the anticipation that my wife and Gooseman are waiting at the next road crossing. And there they are! We will be spending the next several days together. She will slackpack me to the trailheads. This means that l will not have to carry a pack.

I ate supper, hung my bear bag, and went to sleep. I was awakened suddenly about 2 am. There was an animal outside my tent! It was way too big to be a squirrel or a raccoon. I would hear it walk to one side of my tent and then to the other. It was less than ten feet from me at several points. My mind was racing. What was it? A feral hog? A coyote? Maybe even a bear? For fifteen minutes it wouldn't go away. I began to think if it attacked me that I would be stuck inside my tent, unable to get away - a burrito for a bear. I decided the best thing for me to do was to jump out of my tent and try to Bluff and scare it away. I got out my knife, put on my headlight, and slowly unzipped my tent. I jumped out of my tent and yelled. Standing right in front of me was the most startled doe deer you have ever seen. She ran off into the woods where she snorted at me for quite a while.

There are lots of things that can trip me up. Uneven ground, jumbled rocks, deep mud, and spiderwebs of massive tree roots are but a few of them. I don't want to fall. (I've only fallen once so far. It was a face plant on the trail when I twisted my ankle.) I concentrate so much on my footing that I often miss the long views. And that's a shame. I did catch a great view today though. Rocky Top was spectacular today. I see it in the guidebook and the Tennessee Vols song starts as a song worm in my head. Do you know that the person who wrote the song has never been to Rocky Top? He just saw it on a map and thought it would make a good song. I've always been a Georgia Bulldog, but now that we have moved to Tennessee? Rocky Top is the picture I posted. I talked to several of the hikers about their concentration, and they all said they focus three to six feet in front of themselves just like I do. I'm afraid most of us live our lives that way.

I have done this before so I knew what it meant. Going first, I was the Designated Spiderweb Destroyer Ninja. Hundreds of times the DSDN has to knock down the spiderwebs. When you see them you can slash them with a trekking pole. The problem is that they are very hard to see. The standard method of DSDN removal is with your face. You bash open the spider's front door with your nose, and then obliterate the entire spiderweb with your forehead, cheeks, and chin. The best part is when the web strings off of your eyelashes and won't let go. It sticks in your beard and sometimes tickles your ears. The spiders seem to me to be pretty much unintelligent. They keep putting up their webs across the trail day after day, hoping that today will be the day that no hiker DSDN will knock it down. Not too smart. They are smart enough, however to be able to predict my height. Every web seems to be hung at face height. All spiders seem to be dumb, except for the one who was able to clone himself into Spider-Man. I guess there's always one smart one in every bunch. Tomorrow it's someone else's turn to be DSDN.

I managed to stay dry under my tarp in my hammock though. Left out this morning attempting to do my biggest mileage day yet, almost 16 miles. About three miles into the hike I twisted my ankle. It was ok until I decided to take a break about three miles later. When I got up to leave, my ankle didn't want to work correctly. It hurt. As I limped slowly down the trail it began to rain hard. Persistent, my hiking partner, patiently waited for me at a gap. I knew I was slowing him down, and now it was raining even harder. I began to have thoughts of quitting the hike. I'm the slowest hiker out here. The younger hikers fly by me. The older hikers creep by me. It's discouraging sometimes. This pack is heavy. The trail is a sloppy, muddy mess. Now my ankle hurts(in addition to the bottoms of my feet, my back, shoulders, calfs, and quads). I am having a lot of trouble sleeping also. My artificial shoulders hurt when I sleep on the ground, and my legs cramp all night when I sleep in my hammock. Some days it's some fun. Other days it's no fun at all. Did I mention the pack is heavy? The best day ever. My wife called with great news this afternoon. We have been looking for a camper cover for my pickup truck. My oldest son located one, and my wife had just driven to Franklin,NC to get it installed. She was on her way to pick me up if I could get to a road. It meant a 16 mile day would now be an 18 mile day, but Persistent and I made it after 12 hours of hiking, mostly on a bad ankle. We are on our way now to Chattanooga for a zero day at my house where we will retrofit the truck bed for a sleeping station for the trail. We are going to try a thing called a ""key swap"". Every day one of us starts out on the day's trail section from the south. The other one drives to the north end of the section, parks the car at the trailhead, and starts walking south. We meet in the middle, ""swap keys"", and when the northbound hiker gets to the truck he returns to pick up the other hiker. The beauty of this plan is threefold. First, we don't have to carry heavy packs (5 pounds versus 30 pounds). Second, we have a truck to use in the evenings to go out to eat or run errands. Finally, we have a dry place to sleep with a comfortable bed. A key swap should allow us to make bigger mile days without being completely worn out every evening. Hope this works. From the worst day to the best day with one phone call! I'm Grateful2.","jerrys cabin shelter

Hiking without a heavy pack was great! I kept count of the hikers because I was going against the grain ( north to south). 36 hikers passed me, and I knew 19 of them. They all had the same questions. Why are you going north? Where is your pack? Who is slackpacking you? Most of them were jealous. ""I wish I could do that."" I heard it over and over. Everybody hates a heavy pack. One guy said kiddingly, ""That's cheating."" The official Thru-hikers Rules Handbook doesn't make mention of minimum pack weight. It only says you have to hike the entire trail. (That book doesn't really exist, but it ought to for some OCD hikers.) Having a truck tonight was wonderful too. We went to Walmart and then to a Mexican restaurant. I ate two plates of food- a burrito, enchilada, chalupa, chili rellinto, beans, rice, a full bowl of jalapeños, two baskets of chips and salsa, and several glasses of water.

No one likes gaps except Michael Strahan. And he's made a good living featuring a gap. Gaps are tough for hikers though. The best thing about a gap is that sometimes they have roads going through them. A chance for a hitch into town or maybe even trail magic. I have walked some tough gaps so far. I'm sure many more await me. Interesting fact - gaps up north are called ""notches"". A five-letter word for many four-letter words. I may come to dislike that word, too.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562386,"Last night was an adventure of sorts. We found a nice parking spot for the night just inside the national forest next to the AT. Unfortunately it was also near a residential area. As we were setting up, a redneck in his thirties comes riding down the paved road on a four wheeler and stops at our truck. He lets us know in a menacing way that we were not welcome there. We decided to relocate. We found a church down the road where a deacon was cutting the grass. We stopped and explained our situation.  The nice man said the people of his church liked hikers, and we were welcome to park in the church lot. However he said he wouldn't advise it. He said some of the people in the area didn't like hikers. Hikers had parked there before and had their tires slashed and their windows all busted out. Then he went on to say that someone had even burned their  church down and the sheriffs department and even the FBI couldn't find out who did it. It had cost them over 100 thousand dollars to rebuilt it. It was a nice building. We decided to move on. We ended up paying $10 for secure parking at a nearby Hostel. Money well spent. This morning I hiked against the hiker grain, going north to south. I started at 2900 feet and climbed to 5600 feet without a downhill break. Took me over two hours just to get to the top of Big Hump. I could be wrong, but I think this may be the longest continuous uphill ascent on the entire AT. It doesn't get much press because most hikers go the opposite direction and because it is a gradual ascent. But it still may be the longest continuous ascent. At the top is Big Hump, a giant bald, followed by Little Hump, followed by the famous Overmountain Shelter, followed by Jane Bald, followed by Round Bald. When I was going over those balds it felt like I was on a different planet. The moon maybe. I started singing ""Fly Me to the Moon"" at the top of my lungs when one of my friends passed me going the other way. High winds and no trees for miles along with 360 degree vistas. Tonight we are parked at Dividing Ridge Hostel in Hampton. The Hostel is run by Michael and Rikki, a really nice couple with three kids. No charge, just whatever donation we can make. They provided showers and bathroom facilities and even offered to shuttle us both in the morning to the trailhead. Tomorrow we will have to put on our big packs for two days because there are no road crossings for thirty miles. Then they will shuttle us north for a twenty mile return hike. They have offered to let us park the truck here for the next three days.

It was supposed to be 18 miles the first day. We had to do a 30 mile hike because there are no good road crossings on that section. I was feeling good; hiking strong. Then it happened. At 13 smiles in I had a fall. I caught my toe on a root while going downhill and face planted. I lacerated my forehead and nose, and broke my nose. Blood everywhere; on my arms and legs, on my clothes and pack, all over the ground. The first hiker to come by stopped and asked me if I was ok. Haha. Several hikers stopped to help, and we got the bleeding under control. I was miles from civilization so we debated about what to do. I was concerned about internal bleeding or concussion. No cell service either. Go back 6 miles to the nearest travelled gravel road for help? Go forward 5 miles to the next shelter and hope I was ok and that someone had butterfly strips for the cuts? Go forward 11 miles to where I knew there was a Hostel and I could get help? The eleven mile option was out because I couldn't make it by dark. I felt I probably needed medical attention so the shelter option was out. Persistent and I started backtracking, knowing that there was help that way eventually. We had also noticed a little used gravel road about a quarter of a mile that way. Maybe we could get phone service. We started walking slowly. I was woozy but ok. When we got to the little used gravel road, no cell service. We were trying to decide what to do next when I noticed a car parked just around the bend of the road. I started hollering, ""Hello. We need help."" After several times of hollering, someone answered back. A family just happened to be there gathering mushrooms. They agreed to take me to the Hostel where the truck was. Persistent chose to continue hiking to the shelter. I got in the car to go toward the hospital. Ten minutes down that gravel road and I had cell service. Michael from Dividing Ridge Hostel agreed to take me to the nearest medical facility, Sycamore Shoals Medical Center, located the next town over and away we went. Michael waited with me for three hours in the emergency room. CTscans showed no broken facial bones except for my nose. They glued and taped my forehead back together and sent me back to the Hostel.

The swelling on my face has gone down, the bruises are almost gone, and the headaches and neck aches have stopped. I drove up to Damascus yesterday to try and find someone to key swap with. My former partner is already further up the trail and I didn't want to miss any more of the trail than I had to. (I'll have to come back and pick up the 50 miles I missed because of injury after I summit Katahdin in Maine.) Ran into a bunch of my trail friends and told them I was back and what I was looking for. They told me about a man named Chip who had an injured foot he was trying to rehab and needed to slackpack. Met him this morning and we decided to try it out for a few days. We hiked a little less than five miles going north out of Damascus and are now camping in the truck for the night. Interesting sidelight - Chip drove the truck north when we hiked, parked by the trail and started back to meet me. We met in the middle and he said he parked 15 yards from the trail. When I got to the highway at what I thought was Feathercamp Gap I looked all through the parking lot but couldn't find my truck. I assumed then that I had not gotten to the right Gap yet and continued walking. A mile and a half later I met a lady on the trail and asked her how much further to the highway. She said the highway was behind me a mile or so. Uh oh. Turned around and went back to the first parking lot. Couldn't find the truck. Mild panic. But I remembered that Chip said the truck was only 15 yards from the trail. Still no truck. I knew it must be just off the highway, so I started walking down the highway. After half a mile, there was another parking lot, and there was the truck. And it was parked on the Appalachian Trail too! Turns out that the trail was relocated last year because of a washed out bridge, and Chip had actually parked at the former trailhead and walked the former trail. That trail had joined up with the trail I had been on. We didn't know that it had been relocated. I was so glad to finally find the truck. I ended up walking almost eight miles. Fun times.

I saw four different sets of ponies grazing under the beautiful blue sky as I walked with a couple of sisters, Mama Bear and Bambi, who are section hiking. One pony even let us pet him as we went down the trail. We went through Fatman squeeze and over Mt Rogers. BTW- None of us had any trouble getting through the squeeze. 
I saw a bird's nest today unlike any I have ever seen. As I walked up Buzzard Rock with another thru hiker, Smalls (You're killing me Smalls.), we saw a bird fly out from the edge of the trail. We looked down to find the bird's nest it had flown out of. The nest was built on the ground! What kind of bird builds its nest on the ground? I know quails do, but evidently some other birds do also. It was a small bird. How does it protect its eggs from predators? There were five little eggs in the nest. The nest couldn't have been more than nine inches from the trail. Not a great location choice in my mind, but then again, I've never been a mother bird. 
As I walked up the trail with Smalls, he told me what happened to him yesterday evening. He was climbing Buzzard Rock as it started to rain. (Buzzard is a 2000 foot climb.) He was trying to catch up to his friend who had gone on ahead. As he neared the top, he said the lightning and thunder began to hit close. He said suddenly a bolt of lightning hit a tree about 100 feet off the trail. He said it was intensely bright and very loud. He said he was really scared! He turned around and began to run back down the mountain until he got near the bottom where he then pitched his tent in the rain. He said he wasn't ready to die yet. He said he liked living. As we talked and walked up the mountain this morning he suddenly stopped and pointed out in the woods. Sure enough, about 100 feet off the trail was a large tree split and broken just like he had described. He said, ""That's the tree!"" I could see why he would have been scared.

Anyway, I saw him as he was walking almost parallel to me just a few feet below me. Both of us were heading for the same switchback u-turn.

Not too loudly, but just enough to get his attention. He JUMPED. He said, ""Boy, you really got me."" We both laughed and went our opposite ways. 
A little while later I had to cross over a large fallen log on the trail. The usual way to get over such a log is to step close to it on this side, put a pole in the ground on the other side, and use it as a brace to swing the other foot over the log. As I approached the log, I noticed that there were a lot of leaves piled against my side of the log. I immediately thought to check the leaves for snakes. It would be a great hiding place. I stuck my hiking pole in the leaves. Nothing. I put the other pole on the far side of the log. I stepped close to the log.

I met amphibians, appropriately enough, on this wet day. I saw salamanders and frogs. I also saw one reptile, a garter snake. 
I met rain swollen creeks. I could the water roaring well before I got to it. It was deafening every time. Water that I could normally jump across had to be waded. The water was up to my knees. My shoes stayed soaked all day. 
I met some old trail friends, Bushy and Sparks. They want to key swap with me! Hooray! We decided to talk when I got through hiking today. After talking, we decided to join forces and hike the trail with my truck as a shuttle. It will take tomorrow to organize everything so we can start Saturday.","

Sparks, Bushy, and I spent a good part of the day at Auto Zone getting them replaced. We also made sure everything was set up with gear, maps, daily distances, etc. so that we would be able to hike for the next several days. 
We watched a family's house burn to the ground this afternoon. We stood in the motel parking lot and watched the smoke billow out of a house across the valley less than half a mile away. The smoke was white then black then finally white again. I am sure the flames could be seen for miles. The lone fire truck sped past us in the parking lot and in a moment was spraying water over the roof of the house. It burned to the ground. I felt so sorry for the family. They must have lost all of their possessions. I can only wonder what that must feel like. Sparks commented that they once had a moving van with all their possessions stolen from a motel parking lot and it was never recovered. He said that they learned then what was really important. What's important is not stuff. 
I guess that's one of the lessons that the trail teaches you. You carry everything you need on your back. You have such a small amount of stuff and you realize that most of the stuff you have back home you don't really need. It's just stuff. So many other things in life are more important than stuff. Relationships. Experiences. Acts of kindness. Goodness. World views. Health. God.","

After Bushy and Sparks leave going north I drive the truck to the finish to start walking south.

Now I have to drive all the way back around another route and contact my wife about the new route. It's 9 am before I can start walking. We are supposed to meet at 430 and I have 18 miles to go. I basically ran the trail over very rough rock jumbles today in a little over 7 hours. I was absolutely exhausted when I finished. We had issues getting to her though, and we didn't make it before the fancy restaurant closed at 6 pm (on Sunday). I was so hoping to make it because it was our one chance to have a nice meal for our anniversary weekend. I'm Grateful2 she was understanding about the timing. I tried so hard to make it happen.

About 10 miles in today I just ran out of gas. I managed to finish finally and knew I had to take tomorrow off. The last three days of terrain has been very difficult to say the least. I went over Dragons Tooth today. It is a difficult scramble up and over several cliffs and rock faces. At one point I even had to cling to the cliff face with metal rings. It's easily the hardest climb on the trail so far. I'm SO glad it's behind me. They say it gets worse further north. I hope not! 
The last three days have been so difficult that Bushy and Sparks have decided they need to do less miles, so they have decided to put their packs back on and reduce their mileage. I'm sad to see them go. They are a lot of fun. Now I need a new slackpack partner when the family leaves in a couple of weeks.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567410,"Beauty and danger. Experienced both today. And by the way, hiked 19 miles also. 
The beauty manifested itself as we continued to walk the Blue Ridge. As we walk this knife ridge we can see for dozens of miles off both sides. The valleys are populated by sparsely spaced homes and the occasional small town. Further into the distance I can see blue mountain ranges rising to the sky. 
The beauty also showed itself in the flowers. I saw a columbine flower today for only the second time on the trail. The Native American Indians used the seeds of the columbine to smoke in their peace pipes. They thought the fragrant seeds would help to bring about peace in the council meetings. Maybe we could learn a thing or two from them. 
The danger manifested itself today at guillotine rock. A massive boulder sits hanging fifteen feet in the air between two large rock formations. It is on the trail; you must walk under it to continue on the trail. Fortunately no one has ever been injured by falling rock here. 
The danger also showed itself as a rattlesnake today. Ten and I went to get water this afternoon down a blue blazed side trail. After we got our water, we started back up the trail when Ten, who was on the front, suddenly stopped. Two more steps and she would have stepped on it. It wasn't even rattling at that point. It kind of shook Ten up. When the snake realized we were there, it curled up and began to rattle, loudly. That rattle is an eerie and unmistakable sound. I recorded a real cool video clip of it. We left it alone. We saw three more snakes today, a big black rat snake, a tiny ring-necked snake, and another snake that hurried across the trail so fast I couldn't identify it. I'm grateful for both the beauty of the trail and the safety from the dangers.","

The rain didn't seem to bother them, so I tried to not let it bother me either. Walking in the rain is not so bad as long as it's not real cold, and it was a warm day. The only thing that really bothers me is that my shoes fill up with water and that makes it harder to walk. 
I think we had great views of the James River, but all we could see was rain and fog until we were right at the river. We walked across the Foot Bridge, a bridge dedicated to foot traffic only. 
We all decided to get a motel for the night so we could shower and dry out. We then ate out with Ten's Mom in Lexington and did laundry and resupplied. When I put the clothes in the washing machine I also accidentally added the entire gallon baggie of dryer sheets. Yuck.","

The first 2 1/2 miles were up over a mountain. I usually do pretty well going up, but not today. I haven't had to stop and rest going up a mountain in over 500 miles. I had to stop three times going over that first mountain. The mountain wasn't that hard; I just had no energy. I began to think I needed to turn around and go back, but I trusted that eventually my body would catch up and my lungs and legs would start working together. Finally after about five miles I began to feel better.  We finished at 5 pm. Passed the 800 mile mark today!!!  We had a good evening visiting with Carol, AJ, Ten, and Goalie.

Grateful2,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567788,"Why do people hike the Appalachian Trail? People give a lot of different answers to that question. Some say they are running from something in their everyday life. Maybe so. Some say they are out here for the beauty. If so, then it would be easier to find it in their own town or see it here from a car. You can drive to most of the best spots on the AT. Some say they are out here for the solitude. There's entirely too many people on the trail for that to be legitimate. Some say they are out here to accomplish something unique or special. Tens of thousands of hikers have already finished the trail, so finishing will not be unique. Some say they are out here for the fun. What's fun about walking all day in the cold and rain, walking on infected blisters, or climbing for miles when there is no water?
I think most people hike the AT for the challenge of overcoming adversity. It's hard to get out of your sleeping bag when it's 20 degrees or pouring rain. It's hard to climb another mountain when your legs are cramping. It's hard to carry your pack when you are coming out of town with a full food resupply and your pack is at its heaviest. It's hard when you get hurt but you decide to keep on walking. Why do you do it? 
There is something In the human spirit that is satisfied when you conquer an obstacle that is difficult to overcome. That which comes easy does not satisfy. What you work hard for brings a contentment to the soul. Whether it's a hard-earned job promotion, a sports championship, or a good grade on a difficult test, we want to overcome almost insurmountable obstacles. It makes us feel good about ourselves. That need to succeed at something that is difficult is why I think most people hike the trail. Even if they won't admit it. That's why I hiked 21 miles today. To see if I could do it. Sure, I enjoyed the beauty of a magnificent bald at 4000 feet on Cold Mountain today. Sure, I enjoyed the company of friends and family today. But mostly, I did it to see if I could do it. And today I did. Tomorrow awaits. And I'm Grateful2.","

Hikers refer to this shelter journal as the confessional because it is at the Priest. Some of the entries were really funny because I knew the authors. People were confessing their trail habits - everything from sleeping habits to things they say to privy habits. Good stuff. I couldn't think of anything to confess. My mind was preoccupied with something else today. Today I say goodbye to the couple we have been slackpacking with the last two weeks, Ten and Goalie. They will be aquablazing down the Shenandoah River, and I will miss them for a couple of reasons. We have become friends first of all, and second of all I will now have no one to key swap with. My shoulders are bad enough that I don't think I can stay on the trail without the mattress in the back of the truck. So I will be missing them, and I am looking desperately for a new partner. By the time hikers have gotten this far, they are set in their ways and not willing to make a change.

I like being able to hike the Cumberland Trail in our backyard, and then being able to take a shower before I go to bed in our king-sized bed. I like the view to North Carolina from my yard. I miss my church family and playing the bass guitar. I think I've found what I was looking for, and it was right in my backyard the whole time.

Otherwise, you may not make it. I wish it was more like that in the real world. We seem to forget we can't make it by ourselves. So many of us keep trying to make it alone though.
