Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553205,"The knee is all healed, several pieces of gear updated/replaced, and new plans have been drafted. Looks like I will be returning to the trail for another thru hike attempt! I am feeling better prepared physically to handle the wear and tear on this aging body, as well as being a bit wiser in my approach.


I will be returning to Amicalola Falls this coming February - hoping for an early February, weather permitting. Will be looking to spend a couple of days at the lodge (actually, one of their cabins) with my wife, before heading up the approach trail, and beginning my NOBO trek.


This year, I will have a new hiking partner. We gained a new family member, a beautiful and loving English/Australian Shepherd we have named Marshall. He is such a treat, and has performed marvelously on the several prep hikes taken this past year. I am really looking forward to sharing this adventure with him these coming months!


As with my previous attempt, I will try to keep a daily journal to let my friends and family know that I am still alive, and to share as best as I can describe the details of this hiking adventure.

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553521,"Marshall has completed his training, and is now home with us. So excited to have him back home! And very happy with the results of his training!


The foundation is solid, and my wife and I are now continually reinforcing through repetition all of the commands taught. And we are having fun with him at the same time - he has such a sweet temperament and is so eager to please!


I do plan on keeping him on a leash throughout the hike, but will also be looking for opportunities to ""free"" him to run and play. I also expect to have significant time and opportunity during this lengthy hike to continually work on his off leash training. 


And I am sure he will be training me along the way as well...;-)",,Katahdin,"Jan 18, Wed",0
Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553524,"Things are really beginning to fall into place. Travel dates have been set, and the reservations have been made at Amicalola Falls. My wife, Marshall and I will be driving down, visiting the park and local area for a day before starting our trek north.


All my gear is ready, and I have packed and repacked to make sure it all fits and I stay within a reasonable weight. My goal is under 35 (with food and water) starting out, and adjusting (lower) as we go forward. I will need to fine-tune the amount of food needed for Marshall, plus some of the cold-weather gear will be swapped out as we move into Spring/Summer.


Unless the weather takes a nasty turn, Marshall and I will be on the Approach Trail on Friday, February 10th. I expect and therefore will be prepared for cold and snow, but hopefully will not experience extremes of either!

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553637,"Completed my thru-hike registration with the ATC, and received my tag. Not sure if I will actually carry the tag on my pack, but then again, why not?


Discovered that my phone camera is not working...although most of my pictures will be taken on a separate camera, was hoping to take a daily picture with my phone to upload to this journal. Just one more thing to add to my ""to do"" list before my departure date (hoping they can fix it, versus having to replace the phone!).


Will be spending the next several days addressing the ever increasing pile of tasks on said ""to do"" list - household stuff, tax preparation, vehicle prep for the drive down to GA, etc. I am also updating my gear list when time permits.


Getting anxious, but looking forward to kicking off this adventure!

My wife and I (& Marshall!) Made the quick hike up to the summit of Springer Mountain today. Sunny, but windy and cold - but still a fun walk.


I registered at the Amicalola Falls visitor center, and am hiker #47. Will be interesting to see what number I'll be given at the halfway point and at the end!


Back at the lodge for the night. In the morning, Marshall and I will start our hike, and Diane heads for home. Happy she traveled with us, and hiked that first mile with us...it will be difficult to say goodbye in the morning.","USFS 42 Trailhead

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554480,"Marshall and I were shuttled to the Springer parking lot this morning, after tough goodbyes with Diane. She drove home as we started our walk.


At the parking lot we met another thru hiker - Medicine Man. Our shuttle driver Ron took pictures, and said he would post them on his FB page. Ron is one of the busiest and most hiker-friendly shuttle services in this area...He even had treats for Marshall! I really recommend him if in the area.


Forgot to mention in yesterday's entry that we had met a couple of young guys at the top of Springer - Alex and Austin - and that we then gave them a ride to Dahlonega so that they could rethink their pack and drop some weight. Diane's first steps on the AT, and she is already providing trail magic!


Back to today's hike...


It was good to be back in the woods! Fairly easy hike to Hawk Mt shelter on a beautiful sunny day. Short hike, but decided to start slow and easy. Met several others at the shelter, Medicine Man was there, and Alex and Austin came in before end of day.


All in all, a successful start!","Springer parking lot

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554505,"Another great day!


Packed up and headed out by 8:30...Slight drizzle throughout the day, but temp was hovering around 50, so not terrible weather.


A good workout today, especially up Sassafras and then Justis Mountain...I am definitely not yet in great hiking shape! But that will come...


Several times on the uphills, Marshall would stop and give me a look - it was either a ""come on, you're slowing me down"" look, or one of ""hey...You dying back there?"". I told him where I kept the food, just in case...


Marshall is also becoming popular. I met several trail maintainers as I was approaching the shelter, chatted a bit and thanked them for all their hard work, when one of them yelled out, ""hey, it's Marshall!"". She remembered him from Ron's Facebook post!


Same group here at Gooch Mt shelter, plus about a dozen day hikers. Several of the day hikers had previously thru hiked, so it was fun listening to their stories.


Anyway, the rain has started, and it's hiker midnight, so time to hit the hay (tent)!!","Hawk Mt Shelter

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554524,"Woke up several times in the night to the sound of rain hitting the tent. Marshall struggled as well, being the first time in the tent during a rain. But survive the night we did, and in the morning we packed up, did morning chores, and on the trail shortly after 9. Will be working on an earlier start as we begin increasing our miles.


Made it to Woody Gap in decent time, but we were both wiped out. Ate lunch at a picnic table there at the gap, watched dozens of day hikers and tourists come and go. Decided to give the old body a brief rest, and find a hotel for the night.


Once checked in, we walked a couple blocks to Subway, and had lunch in the hotel room. Marshall then crashed for a good nap while I took care of unpacking/hanging all the wet stuff, cleaning the dirty stuff, and doing laundry. Ah, the life of a pampered pet!


Reserved a shuttle back to Woody Gap in the early morning, and now ready to relax!

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554572,"Had a good night's sleep at the hotel, and was on the trail shortly after 9. Cold and windy to start, but quickly warmed into an outstanding day for a walk in the woods!


Not an easy day by any means, but starting to feel stronger on the uphills. Will still be pacing ourselves for a while yet.


Had planned on stopping short of Blood Mountain, and possibly hit the summit at dawn, but ran out of water and the spring at the campsite was dry, so we continued on.


The view on top of Blood Mountain was incredible. A clear day and you could see forever! But we were both parched, so headed down the mountain after just a few minutes.


Long downhill walk, but nothing overly difficult, as long as I kept Marshall in check! We landed at Neel Gap, where I picked up my resupply and bought dinner at Mountain Crossings. They don't allow pets in their hostel so we are camping just north of their buildings (close enough to grab fresh coffee and breakfast in the morning!).


Today was our first double digit mileage day, so getting stronger! Time for a good night's sleep...","Woody Gap

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554654,"Enjoyed a decent night's sleep camping out behind Mountain Crossings (BTW...The folks running/working at the store are great, very hiker friendly!). Grabbed a breakfast sandwich and a coffee from the store, and off we went. Plus, it was another gorgeous day!


Quick side note...when we reached Neel Gap yesterday, was surprised to see several folks we dropped behind when we got off-trail at Woody Gap - Alex and Austin, plus a group of very experienced hikers B-line, Treehouse and Piney. Great to see them again!


Marshall and I made good time up Levelland Mt, and after a few good lung buster's, stopped for lunch on top of Cowrock Mt. I remember back in fall of 2014 making this climb on a gorgeous day, and with hiking partners Greg Behler and his son Luke relaxing on a giant slab of sun-drenched granite. As was today's, a truly enjoyable day!


One of last night's fellow campers - Shay -caught up with Marshall and I during lunch, and we enjoyed his company up and over Wildcat and onward. Final stop for the night was Low Gap shelter where we caught up with Medicine Man - seems like we have our own little hiker bubble forming!


Oh, and another double-digit day!


Forecast calls for a cold and wet evening, so Marshall and I will be staying in a shelter for the first time. This could be interesting...


Way past hiker midnight, so time for bed!","Neel Gap
",Low Gap Shelter,"Feb 14, Tue",11.50
Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554658,"Low Gap was definitely cold last night, but manageable, and Marshall slept well even with a restless, noisy camper (not one in our ""bubble""). The rain hit hard shortly after 4 am, and continued until about 8:30. Getting out of the warm sleeping bag was tough!


We (Marshall, Shay and I) hit the trail by about 9:30, facing a good climb up Blue Mountain. And we were right...It was a good climb!! But we made in great time. After a hard climb to the shelter we enjoyed a quick snack, then finished the climb to the summit and descended to Unicoi Gap. Nearly 10 miles, with a big mountain, in a little over 4 hours! The thought of pizza and a warm hotel room in Helen proved to be a great motivator!!


At the gap parking lot, while Shay and I were trying to figure out a shuttle to town, B-Line came down the trail and almost immediately hitched a ride to town - and was kind enough to talk the young lady into picking we three desperate souls up as well. Turns out she was a successful thru-hiker last year, and a dog lover...so how could she resist? A big thanks to her and to B-Line.


We are now in the hotel having pigged out on pizza earlier. Marshall scarfed the dogfood bought at a nearby grocer (mixed with pizza crust I saved for him), and is asleep on the bed. Shay and I are about to head out for more food and a beer or two, so time to sign off.


Back on the trail in the morning!","Low Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap,"Feb 15, Wed",9.70
Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554779,"Fairly early wake-up after a decent night's sleep in the motel, scant offerings at the continental breakfast, then a couple of hours to pack up before we were to catch our free ride back to the trail. And of course, I forget to grab the chicken strips leftover from dinner that I had saved for lunch today! Oh, well...


The path north from Unicoi Gap seemed to be straight up, and lasted forever...Rocky Mountain was not exactly a friendly welcome back to the trail, especially with full packs! After a steep descent down Rocky, we were treated with a rather lengthy and often steep uphill stretch to the summit of Tray Mountain. One good note, though...As we took a brief break at a gap, a car pulled up on the service road. Three young adults came over, asking us about the AT, and proceeded to share with us one of their beers before leaving. Trail magic of the finest form! But even with that lift, by the time we reached the Tray Mountain Shelter just past the summit, we were all exhausted.


There continues to be a significant water shortage in this area, and rather than risk ending in a dry location for the night (and we did not want to carry the extra weight), we chose to cut our day short and make up the difference tomorrow. We knew the forecast was for a cold night, but set up in the shelter anyway, instead of our tents. Well, the temps plummeted once the sun went down, and the winds picked up, so we all jumped into our sleeping bags to stay warm.


We met several new hikers at this shelter - Red, a section hiker, and Brian and Mike - both thru hikers. And of course, as the campfire was burning fully just before sunset, in walk our friends Piney and Treehouse!


So enough about me, and more on what you really want to know - Marshall! Well, to start, he is really enjoying meeting all the fellow hikers out here, is loving all of the attention, and is overall having a blast. He is eating plenty, but also burning calories as are his human friends. Managing his food is still a learning process, but we'll get there. 


I've also started letting Marshall off-lease more often then not. And he loves this freedom, although he does end up hiking 2 - 3 times more miles than me. He loves to run 25 yards up the trail, then comes running back to check on me, then runs up trail again, etc. When he gets tired, he just runs ahead and then waits for us slowpokes to catch up.


Marshall is a joy to have with me, and when I see him running freely on the trail, and being spoiled by other hikers at the campsite, and at how hard he crashes at the end of the day...Well, let's just say that I am more than happy to work through any of the challenges there may be in having a dog on the trail.


Well, hiker midnight and all...Good night!","Unicoi Gap
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Feb 16, Thu",5.70
Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554799,"A very, very cold night last night, especially with the wind whipping into the shelter. Shared my sleeping quilt with Marshall, in addition to wrapping him in my down jacket, so I think he stayed warm...But very little sleep was had by either of us due to the cold and some loud snoring (most probably from me!!).


But survive we did, and an early start was had, because, well the alternative was to stand in the cold. Plus, since we settled for a short day into the shelter, we had a long day ahead of us to reach our destination.


We now had a group of three as Marshall's flock for the day. Mike, one of the other thru hikers at the shelter, hit the trail same time as Shay and I, and so Marshall tagged him as a new responsibility. It's really intriguing to see the pup's natural herding instincts in action - Marshall, who's mother is a full English Shepherd and father an Aussie, scouts the trail ahead then runs back to make sure the last member (me!) stays close by, then walks in the middle for a while before dashing back to the front.


The hills today were not too terrible, but it sure was a low energy day. By midday, Mike and Shay had pulled ahead, and Marshall and I trudged on. Felt great to reach the final summit of the day, Powell Mountain, but the descent into Dicks Creek Gap was painful! We walked the short 1/2 mile from the gap to Top of Georgia hostel, where we were greeted with great hospitality by Sir Packs a Lot and his staff.


Resupply and a great AYCE dinner in Hiawassee, then lights out (they have separate quarters for hikers with a dog, so we got stuck in a section of the building all by ourselves. Poor us, right???

I know, ""no rain, no Maine"", and all that...But ""it's a marathon, not a sprint"". A battle of cliches, and I liked the latter this time around!


Sad to see them leave, but also know that we will most likely run into our hiking companions up the trail in the near future. And we will meet new ones as we continue on this adventure.

Fully loaded with food and two liters of water moved the pack weight needle to 40 pounds...Will be working to get that down, most likely after the Smokies when Marshall will start carrying some of his food and stuff. We'll start small so that he can build up to carry his food. Maybe my food, too. Eventually maybe even my pack. Who knows?


We made great time those last miles of Georgia without really breaking a sweat. Had a quick lunch at Bly Gap, then pushed onward. One state down. Whoohoo!!


And then we were welcomed into North Carolina. With a bang. Those uphills were punishing! By the time we made it to camp, we were both exhausted, so we set up the tent, ate dinner, and went to bed. A big mile day for us!

",Muskrat Creek Shelter,"Feb 19, Sun",11.80
Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555014,"Made a number of rookie mistakes in pitching the tent last night...My selection of a flat spot proved not to be very flat, nor was it very level. And poor Marshall paid the price, as I rather regularly slid into him, squeezing him into the side of the tent. He only complained once, with a soft growl that I took as a warning...


We slept in a bit to recover from yesterday's march, and knowing that we were only covering 9 miles, with just one significant hill to climb. Once we got packed away, we made good progress all day.


We met a SOBO hiker (trail name Hiccup) as we were packing up. She was on her last leg of her journey south, having to skip this section due to the fires late last year. She was deservedly excited that she was going to finish today!


Speaking of fires...The forest fire last year really did a number on this area. Although thankfully the fire appeared to burn mostly ground level, nearly everything at ground level therefore was charred. Bushes, fallen timbers, all the leaves and grass - a really sad scene from what I remember two years ago. Hoping the new growth of this coming spring will help, but I believe these scars will be here for quite some time.


Another issue with the remains of the fire...The black soot on everything you touch. The logs you sit on at camp, the rocks, even the tree branches were covered with a fine soot. Looking forward to a good shower and laundry, soon!


Well, another day moving forward. Good night!","Muskrat Creek Shelter
",Beech Gap camping sites,"Feb 20, Mon",9.30
Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555068,"Woke up to a beautiful morning after a peaceful night's sleep. Actually pitched the tent on a flat and level surface this time. Also set up the tent using a ridge line between two trees, instead of using my hiking poles, which gave us a bit more headroom inside (I use the Echo II System from Hyperlite Mountain Group). May be using this method more regularly...


The fires also ravaged this section of the trail. I remember well how green and alive the trail felt two years ago, quite the contrast to how it looks and feels today. ""Crispy"" was one word used by a lady day hiker whose path we crossed - a fitting one-word description.


There were sections of the trail today where the fire burned right up to but not the actual heavily compacted trail. The visual effect was quite stunning, as you looked down this dirt path winding lazily through a sea of blackened crust and burnt bushes. Like the infamous yellow brick road winding through the field of poppies, but on a much darker scale...


As we neared the end of our hike for today, after about 9 miles, we reached our biggest challenge of the day...Albert Mountain. A relatively short but at times a nearly vertical climb, with a fire tower and a fantastic view at the top. I unleashed Marshall for his safety, then up we went. This was my third time up this mountain in the past four years, and once again it did not disappoint! I had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath, and was totally spent by the time I reached the top!


And then there was Marshall...He loved it! Marshall charged up the rocks like he was born for it! In fact, when a fellow hiker - Penguin - showed up at the base of the climb, Marshall ran back down and up again to show Penguin the way to the top!


We all rested at the top for a few minutes, before the beast and I headed north to wrap up our day. Our destination was the Long Branch Shelter, over two miles away but a fairly easy downhill stretch.


Penguin, Norseman and a hiker whose trail name I think is Take My Time joined us at the shelter, as well as two other thru hikers whose names I did not get. We had great company at a beautiful and roomy shelter, had good weather, and we were just over 7 miles hiking before reaching Franklin, NC. It does not get any better than this!!

",Long Branch Shelter,"Feb 21, Tue",11.90
Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555122,"Another long night in the sleeping bag, waiting for the sun to rise and begin a new day. But I was warm and dry and resting comfortably while listening to the forecasted overnight rains. We only had a little over 7 miles to walk today, so we were fairly slow in making breakfast and in breaking down camp, hoping to let the rains pass.


The hike itself was relatively uneventful, although a couple of the ascents were steeper than expected. But thoughts were rather focused on getting to town for food, and we made the hike in great time. Shortly after Marshall and I reached the gap, the owner of the Gooder Grove hostel pulls up (we had plans to stay the night at this hostel where I also had sent a mail drop). Not only that, but out from this car jumps Shay, Alex and Brian - hikers from earlier on trail (they had zeroed in Franklin)!


After a few minutes of hellos to our old hiking buddies, and goodbyes to our newest group, Marshall and I jumped in the hostel owner's car for the ride into town and to his hostel. While in town, he gave us a quick tour of downtown Franklin, stopping at a small coffee shop for a much appreciated cup of coffee. I was also introduced to and participated in this shop's ""pay it forward"" program, prepaying for a cup of Java for a needy hiker. Nice concept. The hostel owner is planning on incorporating a similar program into his hostel.


Well, we then get to the hostel. Nice enough place, but immediately did not like the restrictions placed on dogs at house, requiring them to stay in an outdoor pen as his dog does not get along with other dogs. I was not allowed to have Marshall sit with me on the back patio, even if leashed, out of concern that his dog may come out of the house. Really?


Add to this a full house, and I knew it was not a place where we would get good rest. Yes, a bit of an ""entitled"" attitude, but the cost of a hotel room seemed worthwhile, so I made the call and got a room at the Franklin Microtel. The owner was out making a shuttle run, and while waiting for him to return...In walks B-Line, Treehouse and Piney! Another mini reunion!


I do not mean for this to be a slam against that hostel. Seemed like a decent enough place, and I enjoyed my conversations with the owner. It just wasn't right for us at the time. I did not ask for a refund, requesting instead to ""pay it forward"".


We checked in to the hotel, cleaned up, had dinner, and are now ready to crash. A good ending to a full day!

Instead of waiting until we reached Fontana, where a friend was planning to pick him up and dog sit while I hiked the Smokies, I decided to take Marshall home today. This will give him a chance to rest and add back some weight, and for me to exchange some of my gear/clothing directly versus having it mailed to me.


I was able to rent a car in Franklin, and was on the road shortly before noon. A nice easy drive; made it home in just over 8 hours.

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555267,"The day started out like most any other day...A short 4 hour nap, up at midnight, pack up, load up and hit the road by 2 am.


Although a long drive, it was not the hours that got to me. It was the loneliness - Marshall was by now curled up at the foot of Mom's bed, instead of the backseat of my car. And I don't know if I was more envious of Mom or of Marshall!!? It is going to be a bit of an adjustment over these next 2 weeks.


Very uneventful drive, the kind that you want, and beautiful scenery once I got back into the mountains. I made it to the rental car building by around 11, walked over to the Gooder Grove hostel for a shuttle, and was on the trail shortly after 1pm. If my math is correct, that's from a warm bed in the Heartland to a cool trailhead on the AT in under 12 hours...


I was just a little tired when I started, and my pack felt really heavy, even though I had trimmed down the weight to a more respectful 28 lbs fully loaded. Guess the couple of days off made me soft again!


But after a quick mile or two I seemed to have found an extra source of fuel, because my strength had returned and I was really making quick time of it! I'm thinking that box of girl scout thin mints I ate on the drive may have been a contributing factor.

My plan called for a fairly easy hike today with only a couple big hills. If I reached the first shelter early and in good shape, I may stretch the day another 6 miles.


The first couple of climbs were not too terrible, good to stretch the legs out and expand the lungs a bit. Still amazing to see how badly the fire has damaged the area in this section, and the area around Wayah bald was significantly burnt...Even the tower was damaged.


Was feeling pretty good about pushing for a big day, but a mile from Cold Spring Shelter the temps started to drop and it began to sleet, mixed with some snow. Pulled into the shelter and crawled into my sleeping bag to warm up.


About 30 minutes or so later, thru hiker Big Ben dropped in, also calling it quits for the day. Turns out he and I have common backgrounds in the IT field, so we enjoyed a great conversation.


About an hour after Big Ben arrived, 3 more hiked in - Sparky, a 2011 thru hiker, and Hugs and Falls. And shortly after that in walks husband and wife Wick and Janet (who is later given her trail name of Haiku, because, well, she has written several so far on the trail).

Up and out by a little after 8am. Getting more efficient, but still not where I want to be for breaking camp. In due time...


Goal today was to reach the Nantahala Outdoor Center for a late lunch, and spend a night in their bunkhouse. 12 miles, some uphill, mostly down. Piece of cake.


The climbs today were not bad, biggest being up to Wesser Bald. Great views today, but sadly this area was also badly burnt.


The downhills were lengthy and at times painful, but very manageable. A couple of spots the trail was a bit on the dangerous side, where you really had to watch your step to avoid injury. This was especially true at a point called ""The Jump Off"", but the view from there was spectacular!


Good weather all day until near the end. The skies opened up about a quarter mile from my destination. I was rather wet by the time I walked into the lodge's restaurant. Joined Sparky, Hugs and Falls who were already seated, and we all enjoyed a hot lunch. Wick and Haiku made it down the mountain shortly after we were done eating, and Big Ben an hour or so later.

Hugs and Sparky took off like hiking machines, showing no deference to the steep incline of the trail. Falls was right behind them, a bit slower, but steady. I brought up the rear.


Today's plan was for 15 miles. My plan was to survive the first 6 miles out from the NOC, eat lunch at the shelter, then decide whether to continue on.


The hike was tough for me, made more difficult by the rain that would mostly sprinkle, but sometimes pour. I had my pack cover on, but was enjoying the cooling effect of the slight rain. However, with less than a full mile to go, a steady downpour forced me to stop and put on my rain poncho for the rest of the walk.


I finally spotted the shelter, a short downhill off of the AT. What I did not spot, though, was that the log meant to be part of the step structure had come loose - you guessed it, down I went. Actually, it was more of an up then down, as my feet went out from under me and I landed solidly on my back. Fortunately, no damage done. And since this was on the blue-blaze trail to the shelter, I am still claiming to have not fallen yet on the AT. My story, sticking to it. ;-)


There at the shelter wrapping up lunch were my compadres - Wick and Haiku, Sparky, Hugs and Falls. A quick conversation, then they continued on while I stayed for my lunch. Shortly thereafter, a crack of thunder and the skies opened up - my decision was made, I was staying put for the night.


After lunch, I unpacked, put on dry clothes, and crawled into my sleeping bag to warm up. About an hour later two brothers came walking in under heavy rain - Zach and Colten. About an hour after that, another hiker - Richard - came in, soaking wet.


Everyone changed into dry clothes, we each fixed our individual dinners, and quickly jumped into our bags for the night.


A pretty good storm is sweeping through, so while I worry for and hope my friends make it safely to the next shelter, I am thankful for my decision.

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555559,"Woke up to a beautiful, sunny morning, albeit very cold. I believe the temp dropped below thirty, but I stayed warm in my zero-degree bag (very glad I decided to switch to this bag!).


I was moving a little slow due to the cold, but still moved out by 8:30. First climb of the day was Cheoah Bald - a great climb to get the engines warmed up! And boy was I glad I waited until today for this climb...The view was spectacular! Took a few pictures, then back to work, as I had a full day planned - over 15 miles, leaving me a relatively easy hike on Friday to reach Fontana.


The day was absolutely gorgeous. A bit chilly in the shade, but warm in the sun. A number of uphills and downhills were accomplished, a quick lunch at Stecoah Gap (very cold wind blowing through, so it was quick!), and shortly thereafter we hit our second significant uphill challenge for the day: Jacob's Ladder. So steep, you almost rub your nose on the ground while you walk up the trail. OK, maybe not that bad, but it was definitely a calf, thigh and lung burner!


Survived the day, my first 15 miler with a full pack, and I reached the shelter as planned. Set up my tent as the shelter was full, ate dinner with the rest of the gang, and am now relaxing in my tent. Guess it's that time again!

I had packed up my tent and stuff, quick breakfast, then hit the trail. Neil (also known as Ghost) also tented last night, and was also quick to pack and go. And it didn't take long for Zack and Colten to pass me once they got moving!


The miles flew by, with only a couple ups, and eventually I could see the Fontana Lake. Beautiful lake even from a distance - this is one that I need to fish when I am finished with this hike!Seeing the lake and the dam gave extra incentive to keep a fast pace. I popped out of the woods at the marina, and treated myself to a cold come from the soda machine. Then across the road for another couple of miles to the Fontana shelter (and scenic miles, as the trailed hugged the lakeshore for most of the way).


After a quick shuttle to the lodge, I was able to check in to my room early, and enjoy a long, hot shower. Completed my town chores, relaxed a bit, then dinner with the gang - Wick & Haiku, Hugs, Falls, Zack and Colten.


Great dinner, now time for bed.

The route today was going to be a bit rough. Not terrible, just a long uphill into the Smokies. But the weather was absolutely gorgeous! Although the wind was chilly at times, the sky was blue and nearly cloudless, and the sunshine was bright and warm. Really lifted the spirits, making for an enjoyable walk!


And the views! Looking back at Fontana Lake, looking at the mountains that lay ahead...All of it stunning!


Leap frogged with both Falls and Richard today. I missed the water sign at the gap, so of course I run out long before the shelter. Tired and thirsty, I was ready to call it a day at Mollies Ridge shelter. Sparky was there, getting ready to head out to the next shelter, and convinced me to do the same after refueling. About that time Richard walks in, and after water and snacks, Richard and I begin the 3 mile walk, holding a great conversation nearly the entire time. We made it to Russell Field Shelter in no time, and gotta tell ya, this is a much nicer structure. Glad we made the extra miles!


Another great day on the trail, and fun night with hiking friends.

Like all the rest, the routine is similar - pack up, quick breakfast, tie the shoes tight, and begin walking. 


The ""plan"" for the day was aggressive... nearly 15 miles over some tough territory. The first major climb was this monster call Rocky Top. And boy was it a lung burner! But the payback was equally impressive, the views were astounding. And we were blessed with fantastic weather, as well! And yes, I did sing Rocky Top once I hit the summit!


Well, after Rocky Top came a steep up to Thunderhead, followed by additional steep descents and ascents, and a final steep uphill to Derrick Knob Shelter. I was popped, out of gas, and decided to call it a day. A good day.


I had the good fortune of meeting two wonderful people at the shelter that afternoon - Rob and Emma. They were enjoying a short section hike, and this was their last AT shelter on this trip. Very good-hearted, I truly enjoyed our conversations, and wish them all the best as they continue moving forward in their lives.


I was also reconnected with Wick and Haiku, another young couple with whom I've had the pleasure of sharing the trail!

Dakota,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555916,"Last night the weather changed dramatically. The rains that were expected later today hit early, and we were greeted with a wet, foggy and chilly start. And it never did improve. In fact, the winds picked up and the entire day was just...Blah. Mother Nature really showed her nasty side today!


The trail today was once again tough, made especially so due to the mud, wet and slippery rocks, and ice on the trail. Plus, it was uphill the entire time. Through three feet of snow. With nothing to eat but lard sandwiches. Yadayadayada...


OK, pity party over. Yes, the weather was miserable, and some of the climbs were especially tough, but hey...I'm hiking the AT!


About 7 miles into the day, at the Double Spring Gap Shelter where I stopped for lunch, Sparky had left a note about heading into Gatlinburg, and left his number to call. No answer, so I assumed he was being picked up at the Clingman's Dome parking lot. So I set my sights on the same.


After a long climb to Clingman's, I took the side trail to the structure, then made a quick walk down the pathway to the parking lot. Called a shuttle service only to find out the road to the parking lot was closed for the season! Crap!


So back up the half-mile pathway, then another 4+ miles to the Mt Collins shelter. It was nearly 7pm when I arrived and was told the water source at the shelter was frozen (later found out that they just didn't go far enough down the path!). So I changed into dry clothes and am now in my sleeping bag tired, hungry and very thirsty. I am calling it a day. You know, just one of those days!!


But all is well, and tomorrow will be better. Just like Little Orphan Annie promised...Right? ;-)

Had some difficulty sleeping last night. Being hungry and thirsty didn't help, but I think mostly it was the thought of getting to town and warming up / drying out, plus real food!. Woke up, packed up, and on the trail by 8am - definitely on a mission!


Weather remained about the same, maybe a few degrees warmer. But I only had a few miles to cover, which included a big downhill to Newfound Gap. Maybe it was the dampness, but I just could not warm up. And with strong winds, it was freezing at the gap. Decided to pay for a ride to town, versus hitching, so started making some calls. With 2% battery left on phone I was able to secure transportation - too cold up top so waited in bathroom until shuttle arrived.


Arrived in Gatlinburg shortly after noon. Found a spot for lunch, where I was also able to warm up and somewhat dry out. With full belly, I found a place for the night (Microtel), and settled in for the afternoon.


I just returned from dinner - shared a pizza with William, a thru-hiker on a 6-month visa from Scotland. Enjoyed our conversation.


Hiker midnight, and I'm ready to crash.
