Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566716,"This is my first entry in the journal, a week before I hit the trail. I've dreamed of hiking the AT for many years, but I've only been preparing for a few months, since a window suddenly opened that made it a real possibility. The window came late last year in the form of my longtime employer being acquired (again) and subsequently downsizing. Fortunately I received several months notice and was able to start planning a mid-career sabbatical that included my dream thru-hike. But this would not even be a consideration were I not also blessed with my incredibly understanding and supportive wife Sara to help me accomplish this daunting goal while maintaining an active family life with our four growing children. To achieve a balance I will be hiking on and off over the next six months - 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off, as long as it works for everyone. God willing I will have the strength, stamina, and focus to take advantage of this opportunity and see this through to the finish.
Due to the late season start I will flip-flop, first hiking northbound from Harper's Ferry, WV to Katahdin, then southbound from Harper's Ferry to Georgia. This ensures I can get to Katahdin in time and is probably the best weather option, spending summer in New England and Autumn in the South. It will also put me in the thick of both the NOBO and SOBO bubbles ensuring plenty of company should I need it. But I will need to travel fast and light to finish before winter sets in. I expect I may leapfrog the bubble more than once as I move ahead and then step off the trail for a while.",,View Entry,"May 29, Mon",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566861,"My first leg begins northbound from Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. Over a week it will take me across Maryland and midway through my home state of Pennsylvania. 
I recently hiked the first portion of this leg, the length of Maryland, with my then-12-year-old daughter in early April. This was her first backpacking trip and she turned out to be a strong hiker by any standard. 45 miles in 72 hours, southbound from Rt 16 a couple miles north of the Mason-Dixon line to the ATC headquarters in Harper’s Ferry. Maryland is considered one of the easiest sections elevation-wise, one reason we chose it, but this was no cakewalk. Over a long weekend we had snow flurries, a 25 degree night, and an 83 degree day. We encountered miles of continuous rocks, had a nasty fall, forded swollen creeks, and made several steep ascents and descents. But we also encountered both trail magic and a trail angel along the way (they are often conflated but mean different things). I was immensely proud of my daughter's stamina and determination. I could see her confidence growing as we surmounted each challenge.
I enjoyed this section, but I will miss my hiking partner. So to make this solo repeat a little more interesting I’ll be attempting the Four State Challenge. This has you touch four states in one day. You hike from the Virginia border a few miles south of Harper's Ferry up through West Virginia and Maryland to Pennsylvania. It's 45 miles from campsite to campsite. 
On Sunday I'll train into Harper’s Ferry and hike south to a campsite just into Virginia to spend the night. I'll break camp before dawn and walk about 16 hours, hopefully reaching a campsite just north of the Mason-Dixon line by dusk. I will burn around 9000 calories (34 Snickers bars). I'll probably sleep like a rock, then get up and start walking again (a much shorter distance). There will be plenty of bailout points if this turns out to be ludicrous. Maryland has a series of excellent shelters which we enjoyed in April. But no offense to the good people of Maryland, I hope not to be using any of them this time.",,View Entry,"May 30, Tue",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566862,"Most of my gear was dialed in by March and designed for some colder weather. It will come in handy in NH and Maine and later this fall in the southern mountains, but right now a 15 degree quilt and down puffy jacket seem like overkill. But given the chilly, rainy weather we've had lately in the Mid-Atlantic it's all coming with me. I don't expect to be cooling my heels much in camp but overnights in the 40s are not uncommon in the mountains even in June and July.I did at lot of my training on some very rocky steep hills in Valley Forge National Park (hence my initial trail name). Most of this was in daytime temps in the 40s, 30s, even 20s, sometimes with snow cover. Cold is rarely a problem when you are moving. A light poly t-shirt and running fleece was enough to make me sweat unless the wind was really blowing. My concern now is how I will deal with the heat and humidity. I must remember to stay hydrated. To avoid carrying a ton of water I need to ""camel up"" at water sources - ie, chug a liter on the spot. The Sawyer squeeze has been really efficient so far at filtering water quickly. And with all this rain I am hoping the notoriously dry summer springs of Pennsylvania will be more reliable.Up next: final gear check, a run to the store for resupply, and a day trip to the Shore with the kids.",,View Entry,"May 31, Wed",0

The two younger boys are moving up to Wolf and Webelo followed by a camp out. So tonight is my last night in a bed for awhile!

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567285,Had a blast building cardboard race cars with the boys and MC'ing the Cub-anapolis 500 this evening. Followed by them moving up to the next rank in cub scouting. Very proud of them both. Ceremony was interrupted when a hot air balloon landed in a ball field next to us. The scouts all got to help deflate the enormous balloon. Pretty amazing opportunity at just the right time. Now we're camping next to the church pavilion where the ceremony was held. Tomorrow I'll be camping on the Va/WV border.,,View Entry,"Jun 03, Sat",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567402,"Yes, Virginia, there is an AT&T cell signal on your mountaintops!  Stealth camping on a ridge at the Va/WV state line. Tomorrow I leave at first light and head for Pennsylvania. Calling for showers and possible thunderstorms so we'll see how this goes. Ran into a threesome just heading out on the 4 state challenge as I arrived to camp. They will hike through the night and hope to get there by noon. Good luck Ravioli, Shaggy and Happy Jack!
Trained into Harper's Ferry earlier this evening. Long layover in DC so I circuited the Capitol. Chatted up the guards who were eyeing my trekking poles (and waving me away from restricted stairs, tunnels, and anything else interesting). After dinner I hiked south across the Shenandoah and watched an egret glide downriver. Ascending Loudon Heights I rounded a switchback and found I had just walked a three-quarter circle around a doe browsing on the ground cover. She and I saw each other at the same time. She tensed and gave me a look like she had just revealed the secrets of Deer Fight Club. Then turned and disappeared in a cloud of whitetail smoke. 
Time to rest up for a long day tomorrow. Hopefully my next missive is from the Keystone State.",,Stealth camp Va/WV border,"Jun 04, Sun",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567601,"A little short of PA but I gave it my best. Up at 3:30 and couldn't get back to sleep so decamped at 5. Nice conditions in the morning up Weaverton cliffs. Ran into a box turtle who wanted to investigate my shoes. Rained most of the afternoon making for slippery and slow going. Mile for mile Maryland seems to have more rocks than Pennsylvania. Met a bunch of thru-hikers and section hikers today including some flip-floppers who just started. Gypsy Girl took a fall yesterday and is headed to town for some stitches. She thru-hiked in 2010 AND 2011. She looks to be in her seventies. 
After climbing Raven Rock cliffs my last reserve of energy was depleted, and with dark coming on and wet rocks ahead I ducked into the shelter for the night. I'm glad I brought the earplugs.","Stealth camp Va/WV border
",Raven Rock Shelter,"Jun 05, Mon",38.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567692,"Did the last 5 miles to PA this morning. Stayed in Pen Mar park while Toodles and Popeye, from the shelter last night, ordered pizza. Toodles celebrated his three month trailaversary with a ""medium"" size stromboli bigger than his head. I, on the other hand, was unable to finish a 12"" pizza, and made a hiker couple happy with the leftovers.
Left everyone behind to head over Rocky Mountain (well named) and get to Quarry Gap shelter at dusk. There's a rhododendran forest surrounding us, a bubbling brook nearby, and moonlight adding a cool glow to the world. One of Toodles old hiking partners, an older gentleman named On-the-Go, is the only other occupant. It's a double shelter so we each get our own room. He's also marking three months on the trail. 
Toodles, by the way, was named by the last three southbounders from last year. They started at Katahdin last September and met Toodles in Georgia in March. Pretty hardy to hike through the entire winter.
Tomorrow I head to Pine Grove Furnace state park, the unofficial halfway point on the trail, and home of the half-gallon challenge, where you consume a half gallon of ice cream as fast as you can. Doubt I'll have the stomach for that yet, but there is also an AT museum, a beach, and, best of all, a shower.","Raven Rock Shelter
",Quarry Gap Shelter,"Jun 06, Tue",25.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567794,"Sitting on the porch of the Ironmasters Mansion hostel in Pine Grove Forge state park where I'll be staying for the night, watching the moon rise. Many Names, Sunrise, B10, and Blackfoot, one of the guys from Raven Rock, are staying as well.  Hawaii was at the store but moved on, making big miles as she only started two months ago. I met her and her friend briefly when I was getting water in Harper's Ferry early in the 4 state challenge attempt. Her friend was having foot problems and he ended up leaving the trail for awhile, and she's been flying since.
Didn't think I'd try the half gallon ice cream challenge, but I grew hungry as the afternoon wore on and hey, you only live once. I managed to down it all in 90 minutes, in 55 degree weather with a chill wind that made me contemplate hypothermia a few times. Not my proudest moment, but I did get a commemorative wooden Dixie Cup spoon! Of course I ate dinner an hour later. Must be getting my hiker appetite. Also visited the AT museum and got a halfway mark patch which I don't deserve yet but won't find anywhere else.
Trail today was much smoother for the most part. A lot of fog and some showers dampened things but made for comfortable walking. Michaux Forest, which stretches most of South Mountain in PA, is beautiful and relatively remote. No paved road crossing for about ten miles. Lots and lots of some kind of rhodendren which is now in bloom with pinkish-white blossoms. 
Feet are still complaining, a reminder from my first big day. I have some nice heel blisters despite two pairs of socks and KT tape. All part of the package deal though. 
Best thing about the hostel is a hot shower and laundry. That and clean sheets make it feel like the Four Seasons.
Tomorrow headed for Boiling Springs and the Cumberland Valley. And some kind of rock maze on the way.","Quarry Gap Shelter
",Ironmasters Mansion hostel,"Jun 07, Wed",17.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567941,"Back to another big mile day. Trail was relatively easy, except for a prolonged rock scramble called the maze. Finally left South Mountain, which I've been on the entire hike (and the northern tip of the Blue Ridge range), to begin crossing the Cumberland Valley to Blue Mountain. Left the hostel at 7:30 and arrived in Boiling Springs in the southern part of the Valley at 5 to grab dinner and visit the local outfitter for some better insoles for my shoes called Superfeet. The pads of my foot and heel ache constantly thanks I believe to my lightly padded trail runners. This particular model is very stable and good on rocks but not comfortable. 
Then decided to walk across half the Cumberland Valley in the evening to avoid the hot sun the next day. Turns out most of the trail goes through a narrow forested corridor rather than open fields. Made it at dusk to a motel on the outskirts of Carlisle, exhausted. Thankfully no car show today so there was room at the inn. There is no camping allowed and no shelters over the entire valley, an 18-mile stretch. Shared a room with On-the-Go whom I met a couple days earlier at Quarry Gap. He has at least 20 years on me but walks a faster pace most of the time. Wanted to hike the trail since he read an early TimeLife book on it in 1976 when only a few dozen people had ever thru-hiked.
I passed my 100th mile just before Boiling Springs. The town was full of fishermen - young and old - using the centrally located spring lake and creeks.
Spent the evening testing the Superfeet and popping blisters. Hopefully this improves the aches and pains tomorrow. Skipped a chance at second dinner as I wasn't feeling hungry. I'll probably make up for it at breakfast.","Ironmasters Mansion hostel
","Days Inn, Rt 11 Carlisle","Jun 08, Thu",27.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568070,"Great weather today, especially under the green canopy. Walked out of the Cumberland Valley leaving behind the highways, farms, and truck stops. Crossing a field we encountered some territorial cows who herded together and walked slowly, then more quickly toward us, getting within 20 feet or so and only not closer because we took the hint and kept on moving.
The climb over Blue Mountain led to a nice view south. Then just rolling trail, generally favorable. Stopped at a pipeline clearing with a view to the Susquehanna River for a late lunch. Met CBiscuit and Cousin Eddie who I'd seen in the registers and thought were ahead of me. They are occasional hiking partners and are coincidentally both celebrating birthdays today. Sunrise was also on the trail, from Ironmasters hostel, and Renegade who I met for the first time. At a stream crossing I ran across two other hikers relaxing. Told me they'd gone from Georgia to New York, ran out of money, and turned around and were headed back home to Virginia. So either good story tellers or a little nuts, probably some of each. 
A six-mile rocky section late in the day wore down the feet, which up til then had been improved over yesterday. Had my first fall on a long and steep rock staircase coming down into Duncannon, but no worse for wear. Trekking poles have saved me from innumerable tumbles and ankle rolls. I can't recommend them highly enough.
In town by evening, had a beer and tuna melt at the Doyle, a quirky tavern famous in trail lore, and a beautiful old hotel in a very sad state of repair. Staying the night anyway since everything else is miles out of town. I almost decided not to shower after seeing the bathroom. Thruhiker Sixes, who I met for the first time, was there for dinner and B-10, another from Ironmasters, stayed the night. Also met a flip-flopper who started in Harper's Ferry named Reese (as in the candy) who's been taking a much more sensible and slower approach to starting out than me. Also I used a laundromat for the first time since college. The locals were very patient in answering my newbie questions.
Tomorrow I head over the Susquehanna onto Peters Mountain and hope to find a stealth campsite, as the shelters and recognized campsites are few and far between. Sunday I'll be stepping off the trail to spend time at home with the family. Will probably drop off at Swatara Gap.","Days Inn, Rt 11 Carlisle
",The Doyle,"Jun 09, Fri",17.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568139,"It poured in Duncannon for exactly 50 minutes this morning, exactly as the AccuWeather tracker said. Which was fine because I had to wait for the post office to open to retrieve my mail drop with a food resupply. I haven't eaten as much as I thought so to avoid dead weight some Ramen and other stuff went into the hiker box in the post office lobby for someone else to use. I kept the Hershey bar.
I walked out of town and over the busy Clark's Ferry Bridge (US 22/322) and climbed Peters Mountain in the rain-freshened air. Later it would get into the 80s but initially great hiking weather.  The terrain is getting rockier, more like what Pennsylvania is known for. My goal tomorrow is Swatara Gap as an easy exit point to get back home, so I split the distance doing 18 miles today.
Had lunch at Table Rock with a nice view of Sharp Mountain, where I'll be tomorrow, and a comfortable rock couch. A handful of thru and section hikers were out including thru-hikers B10, Peach, and Burning Man. On-the-Go zeroed in Duncannon to nurse the leg he injured yesterday in a fall. A section hiker who started in Dalton,  Massachusetts and another who started in Vermont passed me southbound and we chatted. Three Mennonite/Amish dayhikers were listening in rapt attention to B10's thruhiker story as I passed them. ""I've always wanted to do that"" said one while the others nodded.
No water for 13 miles along the trail today, longest dry spell yet. Another thing Pennsylvania is known for. The spring I topped off at before crossing the desert was a mere trickle. Iced tea I had brought from town was a nice treat.
Tonight I'm stealth camping because the shelters and campsites are too far from my target mileage. My first try camping on virgin ground. The tent is a bit on a slant but so far no rocks in my back. I ate foil-packed smoked salmon for dinner (tastes more like tuna), then worried myself that black bears must love salmon and will smell it from miles away. So up went the bear bag in a tall tree. Pretty sure salmon is not part of the Eastern black bear diet though.
Tomorrow to Swatara Gap then back home to be with the family.","The Doyle
",Stealth camp near PA 325,"Jun 10, Sat",18.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568249,"Up at dawn, but 5 hikers pass while I am still breaking camp. No bears came for the salmon while I slept. I have no appetite, but force myself to eat some pop tarts. I learn later some trail angels were staging a hamburger breakfast cookout at the parking lot a quarter mile behind where I camped. No matter, I'm not ravenous enough yet to eat hamburgers for breakfast.
The day passes quickly. Trail is not difficult with some decent ups and downs as I climb up Sharps Mountain and go along its ridge, then down and up to Second Mountain before descending to Swatara Gap. I pass the terminus of the Horseshoe Trail, which begins 140 miles southeast in Valley Forge National Park. I've walked about 40 miles of this near home so it is a little exciting to see where it ends up. Also pass ruins of Yellow Springs village and Rausch Gap, which were based on coal and railroading in the nineteenth century but abandoned now for over a century. The bridge for the gravel access road over Rausch Creek is out and under construction. The trail is diverted via a blue-blazed detour. Like a true white-blazer I ignore this and follow the original path, passing the backhoes and scrambling down and up the construction embankments and stone-hopping across the creek. It's Sunday so no one is there to shoo me off.
Military helicopters out for training exercises from Fort Indiantown Gap buzz the mountains all day. I try to listen for the birds. I catch up with Still Steve at a side trail going to ""The General"". Still Steve started in Georgia March 9th. I pass on seeing the unknown landmark an unknown distance off trail. Even a quarter mile means hiking another half mile roundtrip. Later, thru-hikers Giggles and Ant-Man pass me going uphill. I wonder if I will ever be that fast. I eventually catch up with Ant-Man and Renegade, who had blown by me on Friday heading for Duncannon, at the next spring. Ant-Man started March 4th in Georgia. I try to reconcile his apparent speed with the time taken to get this far. No sign of any of the folks I've left behind over the last couple days. Folks like Flash, Smash Newton, and Daddy Longlegs that I frequently see in the trail registers remain a day or two ahead.
I hear rustling in the undergrowth often as I scare up critters near the trail. No way to know if it's just a chipmunk or squirrel or perhaps a porcupine or snake. Some more distant rustles could be deer or a coyote for all I can see. None of them want anything to do with me. Except the bugs of course. The honey bees in particular seem to think my shins are worth visiting.
I reach my exit point for this leg:  Rt 72 in Swatara Gap State Park. I try to hitch a ride to get a second lunch in Lickdale two miles south but the traffic is light in this direction and the shoulder is narrow so no one bites. I call for an Uber and driver Paul from Lebanon takes me to the train station in Mount Joy 45 minutes away. He waits at a Circle K while I load up on cold iced teas. We talk about Civil War history and where the Lebanon name came from (did the bologna or the town come first?) I learn Uber tricks to get drivers to pick you up (contact them en route to give them your destination - Uber doesn't tell them until they arrive and drivers sometimes refuse if too far or too short).
Now on Amtrak headed home. I'm eager to see Sara and the kids again and looking forward to some time at home.
Everyone still out there stay hydrated and stay safe!","Stealth camp near PA 325
",Swatara Gap,"Jun 11, Sun",17
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569125,"Back on the trail after a great week at home with the family. We celebrated Father's Day - my sons made me wonderful colorful etched key chains, and my daughter made me a ""God's eye"" charm to take with me on the hike. It's in my ditty bag and I will think of her everytime I open it. We drove up to Wind Gap, PA and had amazing burgers at Daisy's family restaurant for dinner. Then Sara and the kids dropped me off at the trailhead north of town. I miss them already. The kids will be in and away at camps for several weeks so no doubt the time will pass quickly for them, but I will have plenty of time to think about them all while I'm walking. 
Starting up again at Wind Gap skips 96 miles of the AT since I left at Swatara Gap last Sunday, which I will hopefully get to later this summer. It's in our backyard so to speak, and I've dayhiked some of it. Wind Gap puts me in better position to get to Hanover NH in three weeks, where I can catch a train home, and leaves another three week section from there to Katahdin.
Just a minute up the trail climbing out of Wind Gap I saw my first bear of the hike. It looked like a large cub and seemed to be alone (though I assume Mama Bear was nearby). He didn't notice me and was about 50 yards off ambling downhill. I managed to get a shot of him walking away.
Walked 5 or 6 miles along a quiet and occasionally rocky ridge before stopping at an inviting campsite. Took me 40 minutes to set up camp and settle in for the night, including the frustrating task of hanging a bear bag. Hopefully I can improve on that.
Time for some shut-eye. Tomorrow I pass through Delaware Water Gap and into New Jersey. Expecting plenty of rain.","Wind Gap
",Campsite at 1183.6,"Jun 18, Sun",5.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569211,"I thought I'd wake up to a wet tent and spend the day hiking in pouring rain. But God smiled on me and slowed down the storm. Out of the campsite before 6 this morning - took 50 minutes to break camp, another mark I aim to improve.  Hiked ten miles into the touristy village of Delaware Water Gap, though it was quiet on a Monday morning and the ice cream parlor was closed (boo!)
Along the way I saw a few blue-fringed butterflies checking out some flowering bushes, passed through a couple rhododendran tunnels and a fern alley (see photos section), and saw the river and the Jersey side of the Water Gap.
Enjoyed a late (second) breakfast at Farmer's market in the village and some cold drinks. If only I could get Snapple powder to flavor my water. The powder I have tastes like, well, sugary powder.
New Jersey is a beautiful state - at least once you get past the I-80 bridge and at least this northwestern section of it. Gradual climb up Mt. Kittatinny. Walked around Sunfish Pond, a rare glacial lake at this latitude and a National Natural Landmark. Unfortunately global warming melted all the glaciers here, about ten thousand years ago. On the north side hikers have built numerous rock cairns in fanciful and precarious structures. I find two rocks someone stood on end and give it a lintel, Stonehenge style. The lakeshore path is very rocky and I stumble on a blue-tailed newt or salamander trying to sun itself (the weather is not cooperating). He doesn't mind posing for pictures.
The peak of Mt. Kittatinny has 360-degree views of the upper Delaware valley and the New Jersey lakes region. There is a jumble of rocks at the highest point that hikers seem to keep adding to. Ranger is here, headed for Maine. His college-aged son just joined him today at the Gap for a month-long section hike.
As I head down to the Mohican Outdoor Center - a hostel run by the Appalachian Mountain Club - the sky finally opens up. In the last mile I am soaked to the bone. But it feels good after the humid day. First task at the hostel (okay, second after the cold ice tea) is a hot shower and dry clothes. The six-person bunkhouse feels clean and has semi-private rooms, a bath, and a kitchenette. There is a large social room in the main building with comfy leather couches, and a sandwich cafe. Nice job AMC! Several other thru-hikers are here but all new to me. Lots of rocks in Jersey today, so Pennsylvania is not unique. Still I made better time than last week. May be thanks to switching back to my comfy Altra Lone Peaks. The feet reasonably good after 20+ miles. Downside is they are slippier on wet rocks and are starting to disintegrate after only a couple hundred miles. Guessing I'll be getting a new pair before New Hampshire. Not unusual, a thruhiker usually goes through 4 or so pairs of shoes.
Anyway, I throttled myself at 20 today to ease back into it and avoid reawakening my blisters. Works out that the storm will pass this afternoon and evening. I find myself with more downtime than I planned. Looking forward to a good sleep and better weather tomorrow.","Campsite at 1183.6
",Mohican Outdoor Center,"Jun 19, Mon",20.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569382,"Back to big days, did over 27 miles (foot miles, not trail miles). Out of Mohican at 5:45 after waking at 4:30.  Nice views from firetowers, watching the mist float off the lake region. Coming up a hillock named Rattlesnake Mountain I heard a rattle that put me on edge. Turned out to be an insect, but I spent the rest of the climb checking every rock for Timber rattlers. Only to arrive at the top to see three little kids playing on the rocks with a dog and mom taking pictures. They live at the bottom of the hill and come up often. Made my fears seem pretty silly.
Stopped in Culver's Gap for lunch after 18 miles, the only time I saw a car today. Had to walk past a temporarily closed deli, a steakhouse undergoing renovations, and a gas station for rent that sold nothing but gas til I reached Gyp's Tavern and downed some cold drinks and a burger. Sat on the back deck overlooking a lake with vacation cottages and kayakers. One of the section hiker patrons had a large yellow lab that amused us by continually jumping off the dock after a frisbee, then shaking down on land to wet everyone around him. 
On the last 9 miles to the shelter I saw an orange newt and later a porcupine. The porcupine let me know I wasn't welcome by turning it's back and raising it's quills like a peacock. It slowly walked away lowering and raising the quills as it perceived or forgot the threat of my video camera. 
Water is scarce in these parts and the last two sources were respectively pink and orange. I used my sugary ice tea powder to cover the color and taste and held out as long as I could. Thankfully a trail volunteer left water at the next shelter in this desert.
I stopped at Mashipacong shelter after learning my original destination three miles further is next to a presumably mosquito-infested bog. Better to walk it tomorrow and get a good rest tonight. Plenty of thru and section hikers here. Bob and his dog Dylan started in Delaware Water Gap. As did Chipmunk and her beau. All headed to Maine. Falls, Hooch and four others from Mohican also here, all started in Georgia. Scout, from Austin, is hiking the New Jersey section. Lucky Penny and Already Stinky passed through to take their chances at the swamp. 
Looking forward to High Point state park and a pit stop in Unionville tomorrow.","Mohican Outdoor Center
",Mashipacong Shelter,"Jun 20, Tue",26.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569612,"Happy summer solstice! Longest day of the year and one of my longest hiking days. Out of the shelter before 6, I see a molten gold lake at an overlook with the morning sun. The solstice is also Hike Naked Day, so I get that out of the way while the trail is still empty. For ten minutes it did feel nice, worth trying once.
I visit High Point state park HQ and they are giving hikers free sodas. Not my usual 8am drink, but I don't usually hike 6 miles by then. Much appreciated. The park has New Jersey's highest point, a whopping 1700 feet or so, marked by an obelisk you can climb. But it's closed this morning. 
Far northern Jersey is a varied landscape. I pass farms and rolling hills reminiscent of rural New England or my own Chester County. There are swamps, bogs, and marshlands, some with extensive boardwalks to cross built by the local trail maintainers. And there is plenty of deciduous forest, hills, and rocks.
I stop in Unionville, a half mile from the trail on the New York side of the state line. It could have Andy Griffith as sheriff. Homes and stores have flags and banners displayed. There's a general store with a small deli and grocery and a pizza place. I settle on a egg salad sandwich which turns out to be quite large. I also resupply snack and breakfast foods. Sick of pop tarts so I try some fruit squeezers. Hoping to avoid scurvy.
Outside town the trail winds around the Wallkill marsh preserve. I see red-winged blackbirds among many other birds and insects I can't identify. Fortunately the bugs aren't interested in me today. 
The water in this area is terrible. I filter from three flowing streams and get pink, orange, and yellow water respectively. It seems to come from bogs upstream. I bought some tea bags in Unionville to try and cover up the color and taste. Fortunately trail angels have left water jugs at several road crossings. These are a godsend. Thanks to all those who spend their time helping hikers with this essential.
In the evening I reach a road that has an ice cream stand but it closed early today. It had been my motivation for the last ten miles and I still have 5 to go, with no morale boost. I rest snd commiserate with thruhikers J2 and Mr. Shoes and his son Canal Conuct. J2 often hiked with his daughter and both names start with J. I met him yesterday at the pavilion on Mt Sunrise. Mr. Shoes I met at Mohican on Monday and we've been traveling at the same hectic pace since. He and his son are Londoners originally from Jersey. Canal is homeschooled, which is quite difficult in Britain and very costly if you want to take exams required for university. They started out ultralight but have added on all kinds of luxuries and lug packs that weigh twice mine. But they always manage to stay a half hour ahead of me anyway.
The last stretch starts with the Stairway to Heaven (cue Led Zeppelin), a 900-foot high boulder climb. It is strenuous to say the least, more so than any other climb since I started. But it's fun and I push hard to the top. The local teens and exercise groups love it  too and they are tough competition. A young girl and her dog, out with Dad, nip my heels most of the way. At the top I'm drenched in sweat and want a shower more than ever. 
The last few miles become a forced march to the shelter with the dusk closing in. Finally after much frustration the shelter is reached. I set up my tent in the dark with mosquitos biting me and go right to sleep.","Mashipacong Shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569615,"Didn't wake til 6:30 and left camp close to 9. Guess I needed a slow start after yesterday. The feet seem fine and recover overnight but stink to high heaven. Maybe I'll get used to it eventually. I chat with Birdsong since everyone else has left. He's a casino industry veteran who loves birding and started his hike in Maryland.
My goal this morning is a hot dog stand and ice cream parlor at a road crossing ten miles off. They better be open. A few miles in I enter New York , marked by a chalk line on a boulder on the ridge. I pass people from the shelter I hadn't had a chance to meet. A father and son out for a few days, Kool-aid, an older woman thru-hiking taking it nice and slow, and Bloodhound, a 70-year-old Alabaman thru-hiking as part of his bucket list - only he already did it once in 2010!
Everyone catches up, include Mr. Shoes and Canal Conuct, at the Bellvale Farms ice cream parlor. The place is mobbed with local families. The homemade ice cream is fantastic. I have a milkshake and want another but feel too full (already hit the hot dog stand). Little Bear and two women Squeaks and Mumbles show up, young kids who started in Georgia. 
The group splits up. Most are headed a few miles to the next shelter. Mr Shoes and son are meeting relatives up the trail. I am the only one foolish enough to attempt the 16 miles to the second shelter. 
New York turns out to be a grueling state. In general the trail is less rocky, but when the rocks come they are big and steep and often require hand over hand climbs. At one point steel rebar ladder rungs are installed to get you up a 15 foot ledge. I constantly think how unsafe this whole section seems and wonder how many falls occur. Then I remember that 80 year olds, 6 year olds, and at least one blind man have done this and dismiss those thoughts. 
Late in the day I realize I won't make the shelter before dark and aim for a closer mountain to stealth camp. But Arden Mountain is in the way and has many tough boulder climbs. The climb down into Arden Valley is far worse. It seems like a 50 or 60 degree slope littered with boulders and every step could be my last. I thank all my experience rock hopping and cry for joy when I reach the I-84 overpass. 
I make a much more pleasant climb into Harriman state park and find a spot to tent on top of the mountain in a grassy area. I've heard plenty of stories today about bear activity around the next shelter so I hang the food well away from camp, hoping those bears aren't going to bother coming three miles south to my home for the night.","Wawayanda Shelter
",Stealth camp mile 1385,"Jun 22, Thu",23.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569765,"No bears overnight. All quiet in the morning. Passed an older woman named Energizer. Went through the famous Lemon Squeezer without  needing to take my pack off. I've been through narrower at Mohonk a little north of here. But immediately past that was a fork in the trail: a blue sign points to ""the easy way"", and then there's the AT way. Metaphor alert! The AT way is an 8 foot high boulder with no rungs or obvious way to climb. After a few minutes I find the right handholds and struggle up, throwing my poles up first. I can't imagine how shorter or older hikers would manage obstacles like this. I wait around for Energizer to help her but after a while I have to move on.
Although the terrain is generally much easier than yesterday, I am feeling exhausted with each minor climb. The bugs are biting and it is very humid. I decide to take a side trail to Tiorati Lake where there's a beach, showers and vending machines. My trail guide says they open at 9, in 15 minutes. But when I arrive after a lengthy walk the girl at the office says they changed it to 10. Normally someone would be there to let me in but today they're late. Argh! Do I wait and have to rush the rest of the day to make up time? The beach is empty but is behind a high gated chain link fence. The gate is out of sight of the office, but I notice a police car cruising by every few minutes along the road on the far lakeshore. I could sure use a dip but getting arrested isn't in my hiking plans. I grab a soda from the vending machine and ponder. I really need something to snap me out of my lethargy. Finally I go for it, wiggle under the gate, strip off everything but my shorts and dive into the lake. I feel my energy returning! After a couple of laps I hit the beach and dry off out of sight of the road. As I wriggle back under the fence a cyclist pulls up. I nonchalantly point him to the soda machine and he says nothing. Ten minutes later I'm back on the trail. Feeling refreshed I push on to Bear Mountain. I meet a young thru hiker from Illinois named Batman who'd barely seen a mountain before starting. Averages 20 a day now.
A doe is near the trail but doesn't turn and run like every other deer. She just slowly continues on her way, barely acknowledging me. I see what seems to be the same doe miles later and again on Bear Mountain. Maybe all the deer are tame here, but it feels magical, like someone watching over me.
Bear Mountain is what Vanderbilt would have constructed for Biltmore. The trail is like a garden path with literally thousands of terraced stone steps, walls, and pavers. Part is currently under renovation. It feels like a Catskill resort rather than the backcountry. I descend past a hotel (A-ha!) and go through the zoo (the trail is blazed right through it). I see my first bobcat in one of the cages. I meet Chili, a section hiker just returning to the trail from a work trip to Switzerland and headed for Vermont. The zookeepers rush us out so they can close up. Their sign says they are still open for 15 minutes. 
I get a local motel to pick me up for a much needed shower and laundry. Across the street is a BBQ place. Great end to a great day that started out very challenging.
PS - the best part of my day occurred after I composed this. I got the family on the phone and heard from all the kids how their week at camp was and what they're looking forward to next week. It's great to hear their voices. I miss them everyday and think about them often as I hike.","Stealth camp mile 1385

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569861,"Amazing what a shower and clean clothes will do for your outlook. You learn to appreciate the little things,  like tissues, after a week in the backcountry.  
Doug the motel owner drives me back to the trail at Bear Mountain Bridge at 7:30 after a solid breakfast at the biker cafe next door. Doug and his wife have been great, taking in my laundry and shuttling me. They run a comfortable and clean homey place.
Crossing the bridge I see two tug boats inching upriver and mist rising from the hills. It rained overnight and continues to drizzle, but in an hour it will clear up and turn into a beautiful low humidity day. I've been very lucky with the rain this week. 
I meet Eddie Spaghetti at the other side, a retired firefighter from Arizona. We chat away the climb up and over Anthony's Nose. 
I hit a surprise deli at a road crossing in late morning. Perfect timing. Mr. T and Rocketman are there. Rocketman is a retired Air Force rocket scientist. After this his next adventure is to bike across the country. Pretty cool retirement plan.  Mr. T, another older hiker, is bored of the trail and plans to get off in a couple hundred miles. I've asked some other thru-hikers what drives them at this point and the answer is usually to see NH and Maine, or because they simply want to finish. Anyone not determined to finish dropped off already. Mr. T has already hiked NH and Maine. 
The miles pass uneventfully. The trail is easy and weather good. I stumble upon trail angels at a road crossing with a spread of hot dogs, watermelon, drinks, and more. They are PCT thru-hikers and friends of Action Jackson, who I meet for the first time. I'm sorry I'm not more hungry but I'm grateful for the cold drink and fruit. I meet Bulletproof, Daddy Longlegs, and Acadius (who started January 4th). 
I book the next four miles to get to the beach at Canopus Lake before they close. Turns out they close later than expected. I take a refreshing dip in the lake which is a very comfortable temperature. The beach is crowded with local families, and there's a group of hikers hanging out. Ounce, Captain Jack, Trainwreck, Chef and others. The earlier folks filter in as well. Some have been hiking together for a thousand miles. It's mostly a young crowd, some only 19. The trail angels and Action Jackson follow us here and set up again. No one leaves hungry. There is a picture of this motley crew on Daddy Longlegs trail journal on this site. Everyone heads to the next shelter but Daddy Longlegs, who's heading to Manhattan to see his kids for the first time in two months. 
Another relatively easy five miles to the shelter in the evening, where a tent city is erected. There are at least 15-18 thru and section hikers here. Michelle and Veronica are flip-floppers who recently started with their weimeraner dog. The dog was bitten by a rattlesnake on the third day and taken to the hospital. All three have just returned to the trail. I also meet Bill T, who apparently had one of the other 4 rooms at my motel last night. His entire pack (minus food and water) weighs only six and a half pounds. Most thru-hikers have 20-25. He and Ounce seem to be in an ultralight competition. 
A bunch of people are talking about doing 30 miles tomorrow. I only planned 25. But we'll see. If the trail continues as it has today I may be knocking on Connecticut's door tomorrow.","Ft Montgomery
",RPH shelter,"Jun 24, Sat",25.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569963,"Last night we were serenaded by coyotes. It sounds like someone screaming. Very disconcerting. I'm the first up in tent city and on the trail a little after 7 after a tuna breakfast. Most here are gunning for a 30 mile day but I am content to see how it goes. My pace is slower than many of them.
The trail is mostly dirt with rolling hills and some swampy areas, mainly later in the day. This is the Taconic region. Feels like we left NY and its ledges behind at the Hudson, but Connecticut is still a day away. We run into a trail volunteer refreshing the white blazes. He notes all the weed whacking they have to do. I don't appreciate this until the Pawling Preserve late in the day where they don't believe in keeping the trail clear. There the swampy, muggy terrain is made more unpleasant by all the leggy vines and shrubs impinging on the trail. I wish I had a machete.
We are still in deli country and sure enough there is one at mid morning. The mile round trip off-trail is worth it. I walk back to the trail with a mom named Minnie Mouse. She is going slow and I later learn she left the trail today. Hopefully she will recover soon. The afternoon is uneventful until a freak shower wets everything, including the rocks and ledges I need to climb down. This slows me down, but the sun comes out quickly and all is soon dry. 
I pass directly by the Appalachian Trail train station. It runs only on weekends but gets you to Grand Central. Trailer Steve is in the lot tailgating with his two big dogs and hands me a soda and a bologna sandwich. He's waiting for his thruhiker wife Maggie Simpson. He's been supporting her at road crossings since Georgia. I gratefully accept the unexpected treat. But what I've really been looking forward to is the outdoor shower at hiker-friendly Native Landscapes nursery next door. While I'm cooling off there, Chili, Ounce, and Buzz pop in. I thought these 30-milers were way ahead but they were napping in a shelter while I was walking in the rain.
Finally it's time to press on to the next shelter for tonight. I go over stiles and through a dairy farm, dodging large cowpies. Then past hay fields with beautiful views. Then through the miserable Pawling preserve, slipping on wet boards over the swampy ground and dodging vines. I pass the Dover Oak by a roadside. It takes three or four men to encircle it and is older than the pharaohs. Maybe, I don't know. It's old. You can look it up.
Three miles before the shelter I encounter true trail magic. They say the trail provides to those in need, and I've heard firsthand accounts of thruhikers finding a fuel canister just when they needed it, or rock plates for their shoes in just their size sitting in a random shelter, or hikers suddenly appearing to share their water when someone is desperately low. But you only half believe these stories. Well, for the last week I've not carried a sleeping bag. I left it home and took only a liner because I thought it would be plenty warm for  summer and save weight. Boy was I wrong. The liner leaves me shivering at 60 degrees, even with most of my layers on. It frequently drops to 60 overnight. Tonight and for the next few nights it's forecast to drop further into the low 50s and I've been trying to figure out how to manage until I can get more layers or a summer bag in a town. So what do I find draped over a log in the middle of nowhere, right next to the trail? A Coleman sleeping bag. I call out but no one is around. There is no campsite for miles. It looks like it has been there a few days. Someone must have set it to dry and then forgotten it when they moved on. It's a cheap and heavy model, for car camping only and likely not missed by its owner. I manage to stuff it in my pack. I can see if the owner is at the next shelter. If not, it solves my dilemma of how to stay warm. Why I should happen to stumble on a rare find like this now has no easy explanation. That's true trail magic.
I reach Wiley shelter after 26 miles. It's past 7 and I'm staying put. Chili, Ounce, Buzz, and Bulletproof (named for her indestructible bear bag) are there to hear my trail magic story but then plunge into the evening for the next shelter.
Several weekend hikers make a fire. Chef shows up. I make plans for a hostel in a couple days. Into the tent again to keep the bugs away and retain a few extra degrees of warmth.","RPH shelter
",Wiley shelter,"Jun 25, Sun",25.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570174,"The trail magic sleeping bag was very comfortable last night, if still a bit damp. I'm out of camp before 7:30. My goal today is to visit Kent and then get to a campsite one day's hike from Salisbury, where I've arranged to stay in a local home for laundry, etc. I enter Connecticut one mile in, my sixth state (WV, MD, PA, NJ, NY) and walk along beautiful Ten Mile River with roaring rapids. I detour to Bull's Bridge to see the covered bridge, the dam falls and the convenience store. 
Back on the trail Connecticut shows it will not be a state to take lightly. Schagticoke Mountain is steep both up and down. It's followed by numerous other ups and downs. One descent to the Housatonic River is steeper than anything to date, over a jumble of boulders. One wrong move could end the hike. 
Kent is a mile off trail. I catch up to the group that had moved on last night and spend a couple hours hanging out beside the outfitters and exploring the village. There's a cheese shop so I buy a hunk of aged Gouda (not typical hiker fare!) and snack while I walk up and down Main St. Plenty of restaurants and touristy boutiques, a pharmacy, a B&B. I run into Shop Teacher, who is injured and trying to camp in the park but was told at the town hall they no longer allow it. The outfitter has a poor backpacking selection (no sleeping bags). There is no hostel or motel. Not the most hiker-friendly town, but quaint and worth the detour for the afternoon.
Ten miles to the campsite after getting back to the trail. The first four miles are strenuous and include that steep descent. Then five miles of easy level trail along the river. I call home and get to hear from Sara and the boys how art camp and their weekend has been. Then a final uphill to the campsite. It's very busy with many folks I've not met. But my feet are sore, the bugs are biting and I'm not in a social mood. I get water from a hand pump that takes 40 cranks to start. It probably had to come up 500 feet.

",Silver Hill campsite,"Jun 26, Mon",23
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570185,"I awake to cool mountain breezes on Silver Hill. Quietly I break down the tent, eat my last poptarts (no more of them please!), and move out to get to Salisbury by 5. 
Tough hiking all morning. Constant climbing and descending, sometimes very steep. Any one hill is no big deal, but combined they wear me down. Very few views reward these climbs. We call these PUDs - pointless ups and downs. The sweat pours out on the uphills and the feet and knees get hammered on the downhills.
My interim motivation is an inn with a tavern in Falls Village for lunch. It's closed. The village is dead quiet but for the auto repair shop where they are rebuilding ancient trucks. I see a beer sign in the window of the ""Package Store"" and find that this is what Connecticut calls a liquor store. Thankfully they have a cold Coke so the stop isn't a complete loss. Grapenut and another hiker are inside waiting for pizza they've ordered from outside town. The owner is very friendly and tries to answer my silly question on why they call it a package store.
Leaving town there's a shower outside of a building for hikers. I wet my head to cool off. Ten minutes later I pass a view of the roaring falls outside town. There are kids swimming and jumping in the deep pool at the bottom. On the spur of the moment I scamper down the steep access trail, tiptoe across the rocks, and wade in. It feels wonderful. I let the falls wash over me. Back on the rocks the sun dries me in minutes. I see crayfish darting in the shallows. Minutes later I'm back on the trail climbing Mt. Prospect.
Approaching Salisbury I meet McFly taking in Rand's View, a long western view of several mountain ranges across fields of waving grass. A deer grazes on a distant hill. It's a highly unusual sight. 99% of the time we just see ""the green tunnel"" and the rocks and roots ahead of us. It's captivating. Grapenut shows up and they discuss his recent gastrointestinal illness in great detail. I decide to move on.
A long road walk brings me past typical New England homes into Salisbury. Most stores are closing, but the all-important grocery is open late. I set up in a bunk in the home of Vanessa Breton with 5 other hikers including McFly, Gigi, and Duke. Everyone is headed to Maine. Three of them zeroed here today. Three big dogs wander around too, one belongs to a hiker and two live here. The essentials come next - shower, laundry, and resupply and dinner from the market. The crew I've been hanging with for three days is lounging near the market - Switchback, Buzz, Ounce, Bulletproof, Bill T, and Chili. Salisbury has extremely limited accommodations so they will be hiking out to the first shelter. 
Back at the house we chat on the back patio. Suddenly we see a gorgeous rainbow fall on a bell tower. It's a postcard picture. 
Tomorrow I head over Bear Mountain, Connecticut's highest point, and into Massachusetts.","Silver Hill campsite
",Salisbury,"Jun 27, Tue",22
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570279,"I wake to birds outside the window and am afraid I've overslept. I have 20+ hard miles to go before evening. But it's only 5:30. No matter, I'm up. I wash my sneaker insoles, dump the leaden trail magic sleeping bag, and repack. Salisbury is a ghost town til a bakery opens at 7. I grab a croissant and frittata. Other boarders are stirring when I return. I take my leave and walk out of town. Hardly a car passes. I exit through the cemetery, with gravestones and monuments from the 19th century and maybe earlier. A lot more people lived here than appears at present.
The morning is cool and breezy. I realize one cause of my occasional lethargy the past week was humidity. Today I get a break, and just in time. There are four big climbs all in a row: Lion's Head, Bear Mtn, Mt Race, and Mt Everett. Bear and Everett are fun steep climbs over bedrock. There are old growth pine forests that give the  air a fresh smell. I cross into Massachusetts between Bear and Race at a roaring stream in Sages Ravine. At the top of Mt Race, local hiker Joan with her dog gives me the lay of the land. She's been hiking this region for 60 years. She points out Mt Greylock on the horizon, 80 trail miles north and the tallest peak in Massachusetts. She explains that Bear Mtn is NOT the highest point in CT as everyone believes. That honor goes to a side of Mt Frissell whose peak is in Massachusetts. No wonder Connecticut ignores it.
Multitool is resting on Mt Race's rocky peak. I haven't seen him since Swatara Gap in PA. He's hiked all the trail from here to Katahdin before but must do it now to complete his thruhike. I meet Predator at the bottom (named for his hometown Nashville Predators). A SOBO (southbounder) comes through. We excitedly think he's the first SOBO thruhiker from Katahdin this year. But he's just out doing a section. Still, we should start meeting SOBOs very soon.
At the bottom of Mt Everett a local hiking group called The Silver Scramblers have set up a big food spread. Homemade lemonade, cookies, and brownies, watermelon, hot dogs, chocolate milk, hardboiled eggs, apples, and more are all gratefully consumed by the three of us. They've fed 25 thru-hikers in just a few hours. I learn we've just left the Taconic range and will now enter the Berkshires. A brief rain shower ends the party and we move on. 
Predator and I pass up a chance for a dip in Guilder Pond. We've cooled down and the rain has left a temporary chill. The 8+ mile hike to route 7 is generally easy and fast but seems to take forever. The last miles always do. The trail descends to open fields and now I feel the afternoon heat and the bugs find me. Where is that pond now?
At route 7, I face a four mile hot road walk to my motel in Great Barrington. I try to hitch. A dozen cars and trucks pass without a glance. I'm no good at this. I try smiling. No luck. Finally a black SUV pulls over. I stumble and fall backwards over the curb getting out of the way. It's Jamie, a local who works in polymers at the Bayer plant and always picks up hikers. He tells me how Great Barrington and the Berkshires are New York and Boston's summer retreat. The Boston Pops play here for the summer along with many other cultural attractions. He drops me at the motel on the north side of town, basically a strip of restaurants and a supermarket. Perfect for what I need. 
At the motel my summer sleeping bag has arrived. It feels warm and cozy, weighs a tenth of the Coleman, and packs to the size of a Nalgene bottle. The Coleman took up more space than everything else I carry combined. 
After a shower I check out a Greek restaurant a few minutes walk away. It's the first non-sandwich meal I've had on the trail. I almost feel civilized.","Salisbury
",Great Barrington,"Jun 28, Wed",21
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570422,"I'm up at 5:30 again, even in a motel room with the windows shut. The owner drives me to the trailhead. Along the way he wants to talk Indian and US politics. He's an immigrant success story, came to the US via Canada 17 years ago, got citizenship, now owns two motels in town, kids play soccer, and wants to tear down the old motel and build a nice hotel someday. 
Multitool is being dropped off at the same time from another place. We talk awhile then he falls behind. Several big climbs today but they are more spaced out. The trail is rooty and covered in pine needles for the most part, with some muddy and rocky stretches. None of the ups and downs are very taxing but the monotony is wearing. I see no other thru-hikers until I reach the shelter at sundown. Only a handful of people are out. At a campsite I chat with a group of four ladies representing - in their words - four different decades. They are hiking to Gorham, NH, on the other end of the White Mountains.
I stop at the Tom Leonard shelter where according to the logs nocturnal porcupines have been gnawing on the wood. It looks like they are slowly eating the shelter.
The trail is blocked at times by fallen trees. Not just a trunk, but the leafy branches of the crown. I have to bushwhack well around. Trail maintenance is never done. At one point I hear a tree fall in the woods just a hundred yards away. It definitely makes a sound. I thought it was thunder at first. 
At a back road crossing, a farm across the street has a shed on the road painted ""Trail Stand"" with eggs, sodas, and sundry snacks for sale on the honor system. What a pleasant surprise, as there is no town or deli today to grab a cold drink. I stash a soda in my pack's side pocket for later. But an hour later I stumble and fall and the soda explodes leaking sugary root beer on me and the pack. I rescue what remains in the can.
Another long evening hike over what seems like endless miles. I want to call home but the terrain is too rough to keep walking and if I stop I'll end up hiking in the dark. The shelters are poorly spaced here. Finally I reach the shelter - actually a cabin on a pond with caretakers and a bunkroom upstairs. A trail angel brought in apples and bananas, a great treat. Some wag has posted the ""wifi password"" on the wall. Tomorrow the caretakers promise a pancake breakfast!","Great Barrington

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570514,"Up at 5:30 again. I can set my watch to it. There are banana pancakes and coffee as promised, a great start to the day. As I leave, the caretakers are discussing whether the hikers still in bed get to make the pancake batter themselves or whether the kitchen is closing. There's no sleeping in out here.
I meet Perfect Pitch over breakfast. She's very young, a bit awkward, out of shape, moves slowly, not what you'd expect of a long distance hiker, but she came out by herself with her dad's old equipment and has been walking a few miles a day from New York, headed for Katahdin. She seems to have incredible resolve and is undeterred by the challenges. I think later that she is undertaking a very difficult and important journey in her life, and of her own choice. Her dad should be very proud. 
Another long walk in the woods today. It's damp and muggy already. I run into Four Wheel Drive early. He's just taken a dip in the pond to cool off. We chat over much of the rest of day. Originally from Hungary, he and his wife have run a home maintenance business in Tampa Bay for 16 years. Another immigrant success story two days in a row. He also has little charitable to say about the politicians back home. His English is very good, but I still get to try and explain the difference between a bog and a swamp to him (the latter is forested).
In early afternoon we reach the famous Cookie Lady's house. She gives out homemade cookies and sells soda and ice cream. She's not home, but husband Roy, the Cookie Man, helps us out. He's looks to be eighty and walks slowly, but when we leave he's taking apart the engine of his ancient rototiller. He has an antique Nash in the garage. 
A few featureless miles of humid buggy trail later we stumble upon trail magic courtesy of Rob who ran a hostel in nearby Dalton for many years before retiring to Tennessee. He's out here several times a week in early summer to meet all the hikers, including many he saw in Tennessee a few months ago. He wants to meet SOBOs here so he can meet them again back home. 
The humidity finally breaks when a thundershower hits. At first it's light and refreshing and I pass up a chance to hole up in a shelter, opting to walk the last three miles to Dalton. But then it pours, I'm soaked to the skin, and the trail becomes a slippery mess. We trudge over an hour, looking on the bright side that the mosquitos have gone into hiding. The skies clear just as we reach town.
Dalton is not the epicenter of the  Berkshires cultural scene, but they make a decent cheese steak. 
The trail follows residential roads through this working class town, then climbs out of the valley toward tonight's campsite. But the rain returns well ahead of schedule and makes for a miserable trek to find the campsite before dark. I pitch my tent in the rain and try to keep things dry. Fireworks sound in the distance despite the weather as I turn in for the night.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570619,"I don't know how long it rained, but as dawn came the trees continued to shake loose small torrents of raindrops, convincing my sluggish body to roll over and go back to sleep. Finally I was too awake to roll over again and looked at the clock - 5:30, imagine that.
Taking down a wet tent is no more fun than putting it up. The forecast is calling for more thunderstorms later in the afternoon and evening. How much do I bother trying to dry out? I managed to keep the inner tent somewhat dry, but the rainfly and footprint hang from my pack in hopes they dry out. Putting on thoroughly wet clothes, socks, and shoes is as fun as it sounds. The shirt and shorts will eventually air out as I hike, but the socks and shoes stay wet all day thanks to endless mud and runoff on the trail.
It's mostly downhill to Cheshire. The Cobbles is a marble overlook of the Hoosic valley and the town popular with dayhikers. I meet a number of weekend backpackers on their way up. 
I get to clean up a little and refuel at a convenience store in Cheshire before heading up Mt Greylock. Greylock is Massachusetts' highest peak at 3491 feet. That's about 2500 feet above the town. The climb takes a few hours. I pass a long train of boys from a camp out on an overnight trip. One asks me if the worst is behind them. They're maybe one-third up, but I try to be encouraging. I hope the storm holds off until they reach their campsite. The terrain is slippery and difficult enough for me. When I stop for a break, the mosquitos start to swarm me, trying to decide whether my fading coat of Picaridin should deter them.
I pop in to the Mark Noepel Shelter to see if anyone I know stayed there. I have no idea where Predator, 4WD, or anyone else I'd hiked with recently have gone. There is just a ridgerunner and two weekenders there. It's 1:30 but they are already set up for the night to ride out the weather. I press on to the summit, three miles further.
The summit of Greylock is capped with the state's war memorial. The AT goes right over it. There is no view, the cloud/fog has rolled in, but on a clear day you can see into NY, CT, VT, and NH. Next door is a lodge with bunks for hikers. The forecast is now calling for severe storms and it has already started drizzling. I decide to avoid the storm and guaranteed misery and cut my day short for the first time. I can make it up tomorrow in good weather. 
Bascom lodge serves all the tourists who drive to the summit with a cafe and lounge. The bunkroom is in the private second level. There's a weekend hiker taking a nap. I spread out all my wet stuff, take a shower, and get a late lunch.
Thru-hikers Pluck and Wizard are eating on the porch. They started in Shenandoah and Harper's Ferry. They need to press on to meet people at the bottom, storm or no.
I finally get a chance to call home. Everyone seems to be getting along well. The boys loved art camp. My daughter is away at camp and my oldest son is headed to scout camp for a week. We'll all reunite next weekend. I'm very much looking forward to giving them a big hug.
Dinner is a formal affair at Bascom. Everyone eats in one sitting and it's gourmet fare - a scraggly hiker eating apricot-glazed sea bass on a summit in western Massachusetts is a dissonant image. The crowd is mostly tourists who will drive home tonight.
I take an evening walk around the summit. The clouds have closed in and there seems to be nothing but this piece of earth. A plaque with a passage from Thoreau on his own visit captures the beauty of the moment perfectly. 
When I return the bunk room is full. 4WD has reappeared, along with Nemo and Volunteer, and I meet Grace Note, a perky woman in her sixties (so she claims) who's close to completing the trail in sections. There are some Danish girls fresh off the plane with stuffed suitcases. There's John, who is starting section hiking Massachusetts, one weekend at a time. Bill T is also here, reporting that the rest of the crew I'd been hiking with in NY and CT took a zero and is well behind. It comes up that he's lost 40 pounds since starting in Georgia (which by the way is four times the weight of his pack). After 1500 miles thru-hikers almost all look thin and hairy. It's easy to forget they didn't always look that way. I have no idea what I weigh anymore, but I feel like a hobo is looking back at me in the mirror. To trim or not to trim?","Crystal Mountain campsite
",Bascom Lodge,"Jul 01, Sat",13
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570816,"As I leave Bascom Lodge, Greylock is still shrouded in mist. It's six miles down to the valley over two subsidiary peaks and a long steep descent. With few rocks and recent rain I fall twice in one minute on the steepest section. After the second time I stay seated and start laughing. There is only one way down, so I press on. When it finally flattens out the trail turns to slick clay mud until it enters town.
I pass residential streets outside North Adams. Nothing close enough to walk to - no cold drinks this morning. The trail crosses the Hoosic river on a steel footbridge brightly painted with children's handprints. It turns off the road and goes up someone's gravel driveway. They have a hose out with a sign welcoming hikers to use it. 
I begin another climb along a raging creek, the torrents of storm runoff cascading over boulders and making a hundred little waterfalls. But soon the trail turns muddy, and then soupy.  At times I'm climbing up a stream for a long ways. I should just embrace the fact that my feet will be soaked all day, but I can't. I hop from rock to rock, root to root, clambor along the banks of the trail, and bushwhack when there is no dry way through. My shoes and socks get wet anyway. I get angry at the trail builders for their nonexistent efforts to redirect runoff from the trail. This is trail building 101 and is done in every other state. It's like they found a stream and painted blazes along it.
A few miles in I cross into Vermont. Vermont is known affectionately as Vermud on the AT. May is mud season, as spring melt turns trails to mush. This year there's been so much rain the mud never dried up. This southern section is known for mud, a local later tells me.
The 18 miles across this nameless, viewless mountain are miserable muck-walking. There are no clearings to rest, no rocky outcroppings to lounge on. Even the shelters I pass are in flooded areas and positively uninviting for a break. My one respite is a power line clear-cut more than halfway in. There's a welcome strong wind. Though it doesn't deter the flies that have been buzzing me all afternoon. My bug spray has run out. 
I see lots of weekenders, dayhikers, and short-term section hikers but no thru-hikers. I was first out this morning so no one has caught me and I've caught no one. But I'm told there are large numbers within a day of me. Somehow I've fallen into a void.
I have to hustle the last few miles to meet my ride into Bennington. It's already evening. I pass fern-covered open meadow on Harmon Hill, the loveliest spot of the day, but can't linger. The descent to route 9 is steep, rocky, and jarring to the knees. Steve from the motel comes to pick me up. He drops off five hikers hitching out of town. They're part of an even larger group, and will hike up to the nearby shelter for the night. A few of them sound British or Australian.
After a shower, laundry, and dinner delivered to the room I begin to forget about the mud. We'll see if the shoes dry by morning. I'm tempted to take a zero in Bennington but that would throw off my schedule. I will just leave a couple of hours late tomorrow morning so I can resupply and hit the post office. And get bug spray.","Bascom Lodge
",Bennington,"Jul 02, Sun",24.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570815,"Today is much better than yesterday. I take it easy in the morning in town doing my errands up and down the main street of Bennington. It's a large town but very quiet for a Monday, maybe due to the holiday weekend.
Finally it's time to hit the trail. The motel owner Pete drives me out. A far north Vermont native, he grew up watching Canadian TV.  His last motel, in the north, was flooded out. He bought this one last year and has embraced hikers. They make up 75-90% of his summer business.
The sun is shining and the trail feels much better today.  My expectations for Vermud are now more realistic. The storm runoff has largely petered out, and puddles are starting to dry. The worst southern section is behind me. There is still lots of mud, muck, and some residual streams, but I fly through and around it without it affecting my mood. Talking with other hikers, I was not the only one in a foul mood yesterday.
I charge up Mt Glastonbury, 3700+ ft elevation. The summit is a tranquil shady pine forest, but the fire tower provides spectacular full circle 100-mile views. It's a top of the world feeling, with range upon range of mountains receding to the horizon in every direction, and puffy white clouds dancing above. As I reach the last level of the tower above the trees the wind velocity more than doubles. 
There are lots of hikers out today. I meet Bob, a white-haired Virginian who started at the VT-MA border and is headed to Katahdin. James from New Orleans is hiking the Long Trail, which follows the AT for 105 miles then continues on the the Canadian border. He'll hitchhike the length of Vermont back to his car when he's done. Thru-hikers Hoops and Sitting Bull are at the lookout tower. A mix of families, camp groups, and weekenders are also about.  
Four Wheel Drive shows up at the lookout. He's been hiking big miles trying to catch a group called The Fellowship he had been hiking with for the first half of the trail. He thinks they are two shelters ahead, but at the next shelter he is too tired to continue and asks me to take a message on. 
The trail continues through the Glastonbury Wilderness. No road crossings for more than 20 miles. This is the heart of the Green Mountains.
I glide into the Story Spring shelter, passing a gorgeous sun dipping low over a pond. It's a tent city. I find, with difficulty, a relatively dry spot. Bill T, who along with 4WD I left at Mt Greylock, greets me. He too ducked into town after having an awful time yesterday. We seem to have similar perspectives on hiking and the trail, and talk equipment. We have a similar pace so I hope to see more of him through Vermont. I first met him back at the Hudson River, more than 200 miles ago.
4WD suddenly hikes in. He decided to keep moving so he could get rid of the pie he's been carrying. I notice it now, strapped to the top of his pack. The Fellowship is in fact here, as the tent city comes to life with pleasant shock that 4WD has rejoined them. Some of them are the kids who were dropped off last night as I was getting my ride into town. Bill T also meets someone he last saw in Tennessee. It's like a big reunion party, complete with cherry pie.","Bennington
",Story Spring Shelter,"Jul 03, Mon",19
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570878,"Another good day, but wearisome as well. I am sluggish to get out of my sleeping bag on this chilly morning. The dry clothes I hung last night inside the tent are now damp. No technique has ever dried out clothes in camp overnight. Only sun and wind work.
The day starts with a four-mile muck walk, but then a reprieve as I climb Mt Stratton. The fir-covered summit is crawling with thru-hikers, and soon with day hikers. One dad has his infant daughter on his back. There's a caretaker making sure the firetower isn't overcrowded. He's been working the summit for 50 years, hiking up and living in a small shack for days at a time. The door was replaced after a bear ripped it off to find the curry that was cooked there. 
There's a buzz when the caretaker says a thruhiker passed through this morning attempting to break the speed record (currently 45 days). He started in Georgia 37 days ago. Most of the Georgia guys on the summit started 4 months ago.  
More fantastic views from the firetower. We can see Mt Greylock, which I left two and half days ago, as a distant light blue double summit on the southern horizon. Mt Washington in NH is visible, 127 air miles away.
At the bottom of the mountain the  Fellowship group is lounging at Stratton Pond. I take a refreshing dip. So does Long Trail hiker James and his dog Baloo, who shakes it off on everyone's packs.
There's another ten plus miles to the road and it's a long afternoon with little to break it up. At Prospect Rock I can see Manchester Center miles off, my destination for the night. 
Finally at the road, I start thumbing for a ride. The B&B owner and others told me it was easy and drivers always stop. But dozens of cars pass. There's a hill and a curve and little room to slow down, so it's hard to see how this was ever a good spot. A dayhiker, Tom, returning to his car saves me the five mile walk to town. He drops me at a pizza place. 
I intend to resupply before checking in but Frank the B&B owner is pressed for time and picks me up and takes me the half mile to his place. I shower and lie down for a moment and wake up hours later to the booms of fireworks. I stumble out to the street to watch the spectacle over the houses. It's quite a show for a small town. It reminds me of taking the kids to the fireworks in years past and I think about how they're doing at home and at camp.
Four more days and 97 miles to Hanover, where I'll step off the trail to be with the family for awhile. I am very much looking forward to it.","Story Spring Shelter
",Manchester Center,"Jul 04, Tue",21.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570983,"I resupply this morning in Manchester before heading out. B&B owner Frank demurs when I ask for a ride, citing his errands and regaling me on how hospitable people are here and how easy it will be to get a ride. I walk across town and toward the mountain about two miles, thumbing much of the way. A hundred cars must have passed. The good-hearted people in Vermont must sleep in. Finally Cesar, a kid from Buffalo, picks me up. He's headed to the trail head for an overnighter.  I meet Pickles and Highlander there taking a rest.
Its already nearly 10 and it's 25 miles to the shelter. I'm not sure I can get there by dark. There are several good climbs in the morning. Mt Bromley, the ski resort, has a bald top with ski lifts approached by a ski run that is a wildflower meadow in summer. A family with 4 kids is there. Not dayhikers, they are backpacking for four weeks from NH to Massachusetts. Things seem to be going well for them. The views are very good and I linger.
Mts Styles and Peru are next, and finally Mt Baxter. I pass 4 shelters within 5 miles. The spacing strategy eludes me. At one shelter I finally catch up to Predator who I last saw at Upper Goose Pond, before Mt Greylock. He's been clocking a lot of miles but took a zero in Manchester. 
At another shelter I talk with German thru-hikers Camino and Member. They met on the trail but have been hiking together for awhile. Camino has hiked several of the pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela, while Member has hiked across the Alps, the Scottish Highlands, Wales, and through Alaskan mountain passes with 20 feet of snow. They make good mileage.
The terrain changes late in the day to hills covered by pine forests and jagged white rocks. Hikers have made cairns with them, so many it looks like a city of cairns.
Finally at the shelter, Bill T is there along with flip-floppers Honeystick and Chipmunk. A stream tumbles in the background and the mosquitos float around us. I opt to sleep in the shelter instead of tenting for the first time in weeks so I can get an early start for Killington tomorrow. It's almost 30 miles.","Manchester Center
",Greenwall Shelter,"Jul 05, Wed",24.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571095,"I planned big miles for today to get to Killington village so I will be in position to train home on Sunday to be with the family. I sleep in the shelter to avoid having to break down my tent. The bugs are mercifully few. I hit the trail around 6:30. There are some steep climbs in the morning, including a 600 foot rock scramble. There are some nice views of Rutland's airport, and a suspension footbridge over roaring Clarendon Gorge. The trail is a little muddier here but still far better than after the storms. Some of the stream crossings have high water and wet rocks. A passing cloud lets loose a few drops and moves on. I make good time in the morning. My pace is finally improving. Still nothing to brag about, but my body surprises me today with how quickly and continuously it moves even uphill.
At a break in a shelter I meet John, my first southbound thruhiker. He left Katahdin on June 1. He did the AT northbound before and prefers southbound to get the most difficult part done early. What are strenuous climbs to me in Vermont are now barely noticable to him after the White Mountains. He thinks there is one other SOBO ahead of him, someone I missed or mistook for a section hiker.
I meet a man and his young son thruhiking the Long Trail. Mom and dad did the AT in '99. When I ask where he's headed the boy announces ""Canada!"" There are a number of LT hikers on the trail today. Bad News, an AT thruhiker who completed the LT tells me the northern part after it leaves the AT is much more challenging. 
I catch up with Bill T and Bad News at the peak of Mt Killington, today's longest and highest climb at 4200+ feet. Although the AT doesn't actually cross the summit. Instead there is a side trail that becomes a devilish 300 foot rock scramble. The summit is windy and cold, an Alpine environment, and the views are excellent. Just below on the other side is the ski lift and lodge. There's a restaurant inside. All mountains should have restaurants on top. Mountain bikers come off the ski lift to ride trails down the mountain. 
Ten more miles to the village by trail. The ski lift would take us within a mile or so, but sadly it has no white blaze. Bill T and I talk the whole way and make good time, but not good enough to make the convenience store before it closes. The owner is already in his car when we walk up. He pays us no attention. Fortunately the motel owner gives us a delivery menu. I get a chicken and spinach salad. Anyone who knows me will tell you I never ever order a salad. But my body craves better nutrients and I have no regrets. 
Only two days until I reach New Hampshire. It amazes me that two and a half weeks ago I was about to leave Pennsylvania. It has been a whirlwind of states, each with their unique challenges. Somehow I am still on pace with the plan I put together in my comfy armchair at home. The trail has been harder than I expected, but I put in the extra time, effort, and endurance to make it work, even as I threw in more town stops to keep my sanity this past week. Still, reading about other hikers' encounters with the Whites makes me think that may prove an entirely different kind of challenge.","Greenwall Shelter
",Killington,"Jul 06, Thu",28.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571215,"I'm up early with only 5 hours sleep but feel refreshed. Motel owner Steve has laid out a great spread of fruits, hardboiled eggs, OJ, and yogurt, plus he makes made-to-order chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup from a tree up the road. His hobby is roasting coffee beans. He has large burlap sacks of AA arabica beans around the lobby from all the best coffee regions. Honduran is served with breakfast. I'm no coffee drinker but it's great stuff. He sells online under Killington Coffee Roasters.
Pleasantly full, I stop at the mini-market next door for a minor resupply of snack bars and a sandwich for the road. I walk down the rural highway to the outfitters where they replace my trekking pole tips. One was completely bent and no longer providing reliable support. I've relied on them heavily for everything from scaling hills to braking on downhills to being third and fourth legs as I negotiate mud and other obstacles. 
I left my pack outside at the outfitters and the top open as I had taken out my ""wallet"" (a Ziploc baggy). When I come out to bang the new tips in, a cocker poodle is standing over my deli sandwich which is dumped all over the porch. The poodle can't believe her good fortune, but before she can react I grab everything and throw it back together. Yes, I ate it later. 
Back on trail near 10am I pass tranquil Kent Pond and soon Thundering Falls. The rivulets diverting, joining, and splitting again as they cascade over the bedrock is mesmerizing. Tourists come up from the gravel road.
I meet more southbounders today. Now five total plus one I missed. Soon they will be routine. One says he's doing his first 20 mile day. He's almost 500 miles into his hike. That tells you how tough NH and Maine are. A northbounder passes us who is finishing a section southbound for logistical reasons. He gives valuable information about huts in the White Mountains and work for stay. This is a fantastic deal where you get free food and shelter that weekenders pay high prices for in exchange for some trivial chore. The huts are taking almost everyone for work-for-stay, contra the two person limit per hut that everyone says. The Vermont Youth Conservation Corps is working on the trail today, breaking up rocks to throw in muddy areas and trimming vegetation. Young people join the VYCC for six week stints for minimal pay and backcountry food and lodging. The local AMC trail club hires them to help with trail maintenance. We thank them profusely for their efforts. They could use a few crews in southern Vermont.
There's a farm store 20 miles down trail that sells ice cream and cold drinks, but they close at 5:30. I reluctantly accept I won't make it and just enjoy the hike. I intend to do 22 or 23 miles, leaving a 20 mile walk into Hanover tomorrow as the earliest train won't leave until Sunday morning. But something has come over me and I start tearing up the trail. I dash up Mt Quimby, a steep 1200 foot climb over a mile and a quarter, and practically fly through the downhills using my trekking poles to keep me airborne. Maybe it's the spinach salad and breakfast fruit. Maybe it's the well graded and groomed trail. Maybe the cool temperature and breeze. Maybe I finally got my trail legs (and lungs). Whatever the case, the miles melt away. Where I normally would have missed the farm store by over an hour, I now waltz in with Bad News behind me a full 45 minutes before it closes. I can hardly believe how fast I got here. After some Hershey's ice cream, homemade cookies, ice tea, and maple soda I'm sluggish but ready to tackle another 9 miles to the shelter. It will turn into a back-to-back 29 mile day when I was supposed to be taking it easy.
I hike half the day with Bad News. He's in a gap year out of high school, headed for the Webb Institute to study naval architecture and marine engineering. He was accepted to the Coast Guard Academy until they found a minor color blindness that apparently would make it difficult to read signals. In any case he's excited to start school. He's called Bad News because he would report when it was going to rain.
Suddenly we hear leaves rustling and two black bears are running parallel to us on the downhill side about 70 yards off. It's not clear if they notice us but they head into the brush and disappear. Later three deer do notice us and take off running. We descend the hill, cross a road, and climb another hill in a broad arc only to run into the same three does and scare them off again. On the topic of fauna, I also saw several red squirrels yesterday and today. And others report seeing ""signs"" of moose on the trail. I'm warned never to camp on the trail because moose use it as a highway and will literally trample you. 
We get caught in an evening shower. The trees protect us from most of it but this is farm country and we traverse many overgrown meadows. The wet grass is very efficient at soaking our shoes and socks. When we rock hop over an overflowing brook Bad News takes a tumble and gets soaked. His trekking pole heads downstream. I scramble along boulders to reach it before it's gone. Fortunately there's a cooler of trail magic sodas to give a happy ending to the ordeal, my first trail magic in Vermont.
As the rain ends the full moon rises and mist floats off the valley. We race against dusk to the shelter, only to find it full. Up goes the tent in the dark. I'm very practiced at it now. I'm too tired to hang the bear bag properly, hooking it over a branch at arm's length will have to do. I crawl into the tent, wring out my socks, and  plan which all-you-can-eat buffet to hit in Hanover tomorrow.","Killington
",Thistle Hill Shelter,"Jul 07, Fri",28.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571348,"It's raining when I awake and I snuggle in my bag until it lets up. There were almost 20 people camped in and around the shelter last night. Predator and Bill T leave early. Likely the last I see of them. They will reach Katahdin before month-end. I eat the last of the sandwich I rescued from the cocker poodle for breakfast. My damp clothes feel extra clammy this morning.
Starting out on the trail, my energy soon lags. It's less than 15 miles to Hanover with few serious climbs but I take several breaks. Vermud has reappeared this last day and the feet stay soaked. Someone has placed a rough-hewn bench at a hilltop view and I take full advantage. On the way down I meet southbounders 7, 8, and 9. The last two are a fifty-something couple with a dog. Who'd have guessed they'd be in the vanguard?
Crossing the White River at West Hartford some young boys at the nearby house call out if I want a soda. Do I? Why, yes! Mom is on the porch as they eagerly open the mini fridge to show the selection. I gratefully take a Moxie, a hard find outside of New England. And a slice of watermelon would be lovely, thank you! A toddler in a diaper wants to help too. They are helping Dad build an above-ground pool. A nephew and an uncle separately thru-hiked years ago. I notice a hand-made wooden AT symbol over the barn. As I leave, the mom warns a thunderstorm is coming in a few hours. No worries, I'll be in town by then.
45 minutes later a heavy downpour hits me. I am 2 miles from Happy Hill Shelter and it takes forever to get over decidely un-Happy Hill. I'm thoroughly soaked by the time I squeeze into the shelter with Goliath, X-ray, and Oh Well, who were all at my shelter last night. 20 minutes later the storm has passed and I take off. Bad News has now caught up. We gradually dry out (except the socks) over the last few miles. I pass through the streets of Norwich, get a free day-old seafood sandwich at Dan and Whit's grocery and then walk down to the Connecticut River where I officially enter New Hampshire and complete my seventh state. 
Entering Hanover it's clear I stand out like a sore thumb. Preppy parents and trendy kids give me odd looks before averting their eyes. The trail passes Dartmouth Green and goes right down the main shopping drag. Perhaps I need to wear my Dartmouth alumnus shirt to gain some respect.
I finally get the burrito I've been longing for the last several weeks. Then over to the community center for a shower and laundry but, oh, the sign says hiker services are weekdays only in summer - the thruhiker season! Also the town's ""outfitter"" turns out to be a North Face store. Great if you want a fleece I guess. But the final cut is their amazing local bus system doesn't run on weekends. So the two miles to my motel are a problem. There are no accommodations in town except the exorbitantly priced Hanover Inn. But wait, there are tons of trail angels who will host you for a night. The library has a list! I call or text 10 of them as requested on the list. Two have no availability and no one else responds. So much for hiker-friendly Hanover.
One ray of sunshine is the Dartmouth Outing Club, which lets me drop my pack in their office while I wander town. I see a flyer for their upcoming Freshman Trips and flash back to the misty morning 26 years ago when I arrived on the Green to join my own freshmen group to hike up Mt Moosilauke.
Another thunderstorm hits town and rain lingers. I don't want to walk two miles in this. After trying several trail angels listed as providing local shuttles who turn out to be busy, I finally get Andrew who picks me up in 20 minutes and delivers me to the motel. He moved here from Wyoming a few years ago to work for the college and shuttles hikers all the time. He did the AT himself in '95, when the frats were still allowed to host hikers. Thank you Andrew! Once again my trail angel is an out-of-towner. For a town that was instrumental in building the trail, prides itself on outdoor living, and was Bill Bryson's base for popularizing the trail it seems to have little regard for actual hikers.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571433,"Riding Amtrak home from White River Junction. It was a two and a half mile road walk along a narrow shoulder from the motel to the station. But it was sunny and breezy and a low mileage day so I didn't mind.

anticipating the White Mountain views
I've now done 635 miles over 27 full days, or 30% of the trail. On average I hiked 90% of a marathon a day - over rocks, roots, mud, and mountains. Many days I walked from early morning to dusk. Only once did I start walking after 10. A treat was breaking for a whole hour. Many days my lunch or dinner was snacks eaten on the go. A slower pace would let me take in more - observe nature, meditate, take a swim, see a sight off-trail, chat, build a fire, hang out. I did some of this but not as much as you'd guess. On the other hand the rapid pace gave me more options. I could reach town in two days instead of 3 or 4. Carry less food and water. Linger somewhere knowing I could make up the difference later. I could see more, but it was more of a blur in between. And tougher on the feet.
Hiking the green tunnel is often monotonous. You exert great effort and sometimes get no view at all. For the amount of time spent there are relatively few animal sightings. Plenty of fleeing chipmunks and squirrels, occasional deer and butterflies, but precious few animals you can't see in your backyard. Often the reward for the hike is the hike itself. You just walked 25 miles! You entered a new state! You climbed twelve mountains since breakfast! You danced over rocks for six miles!
There is lots of time to think, but always your mind is actively scanning the trail, planning six steps ahead, looking for landmarks, assessing water and food needs, swatting bugs. Sometimes you can zone out and automate these behaviors and contemplate other things. Sometimes your focus is completely fixated on the hike, like during a steep downhill or finding a shelter near dark. If you want lots of time to think, find a bench next to a quiet lake, don't hike hundreds of miles.
The long-distance scenery is usually gorgeous, what you'd see taking a scenic drive. It can be repetitive too, yet another blue ridge or green mountain. The 100 mile views are spectacular and can only be experienced in person. They will never get old. The up close view is less romantic. Tree trunks and underbrush everywhere. It's easy to get lost if you leave the trail. But people are very good about packing out trash, so the forest is almost always pristine and natural. And after hundreds of miles you recognize many different kinds of forest - pine, fir, deciduous, clay, loam, swamp, bog, rocky ridge, subalpine, alpine, and more. You become a rock connoisseur - shale, quartz, schist, granite, marble, limestone, sandstone. There's even different types of mud!
Hiking is physically demanding, but not necessarily how you'd expect. After a few weeks your legs and lungs handle all but the steepest uphills without much trouble. The more demanding part is the acrobatic dance across (or down) the jumble of rocks and roots that constitutes most of the trail. Where there are few rocks the trail often erodes to leave more roots and mud. The trail also twists and turns in seemingly random ways to follow the terrain or stay within the preserved corridor. All those little-used muscles in your legs and feet that a treadmill or road run never touches come into play to maintain your balance. Trekking poles also help tremendously. It's a mental challenge as much as physical, as the acrobatics can go on for hours and come up at any time. The best cross-training for hiking is trail running because it faces the same challenge.
I was rarely bothered by carrying a pack. I kept the weight around 20 pounds most of the time, lower than average. The weight fell mostly on my hips, and when they started to ache I would reposition it around my waist. It was more noticeable when I was already tired for other reasons. Carrying the enormous trail magic sleeping bag for a few days made me appreciate the benefits of a lightweight pack.
The best unexpected benefit of the journey is meeting people. I've never been a naturally gregarious person but striking up conversations on the trail is very easy. Everyone has a shared experience and almost everyone is eager to talk about it and about themselves. For a suburban boy cloistered in an office most of his waking time, talking with people from all over the country (and beyond) and all walks of life is eye-opening and intriguing. One regret in maintaining a fast pace is leaving behind so many interesting folks I would like to know better. On the other hand, I meet more people by traveling up through the ranks.
Experiencing the generosity of strangers is humbling. All the good folks who go out of their way to help hikers, whether with cold drinks, food, rides, beds, information, or encouragement, show you the better side of human nature. At no time did I experience real hostility or anger toward hikers. In most cases people simply have little understanding of what hikers are facing and are naturally engrossed in their own lives. This makes me wonder how little I appreciate the situations many others are in and how indifferent I have been. What kind of person do I want to be? Everyone can use a trail angel in their most difficult moments.

We hiked an eight mile section as practice for a multi day trip later this week. The trail was mostly level but about halfway in it became extremely rocky, culminating in the hair-raising Knife Edge, a narrow strip of bedrock protruding at an angle with nowhere to go but down if you step off. Soon after we had a spectacular view from the top of Bear Rocks. And we ended the day with another great view from Bake Oven Knob. My son did great throughout, and seemed to enjoy the challenge of the rocks. Met several thru-hikers, most of whom started in April or even May, including Warden. We were shuttled by Craig from the Rock n Sole hostel, a real genial guy retired from 25 years as a state trooper who knows the area like few others.",,Bake Oven Knob,"Jul 20, Thu",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572806,"First day of a four-day trip with my son from Swatara Gap, where I left the trail in early June, to the Pinnacle some 45 miles north. Craig from Rock n Sole hostel again shuttled us to the starting point after we left our car at the Hamburg reservoir. The day started mild but humid as we climbed out of the Gap. Lunch midway up the climb renewed our energy. We talked with some boy scouts finishing up a short outing in training for a trip to Philmont. 
My son was enthusiastic and energized much of the day. I found myself a little sluggish with the humidity and occasional rocks. With a thunderstorm closing in and starting to wet us down we ducked into the William Penn shelter, thinking we'd stay the night. Our goal was the 501 shelter four miles further, so this was a wrench in our plans. There we met Rocket Man (not the one I met in New York) three months into his thruhike. When the rain stopped the radar seemed to show a big gap so we left for the 501 shelter. We made good time but the rain caught us again. My son remained in good spirits throughout, at one point remarking that rocks make the trail more interesting. 
Part of our motivation to go the extra miles was the ability to get pizza delivered to 501. So when we arrived, our rain jackets soaked, one of the first things we did was order. We waited out in the rain at the road for the delivery boy with an umbrella graciously lent by another hiker. The delivery boy forgot our drinks, but the pizza and steak were much appreciated. We went to bed in wooden bunks with the rain pounding on the metal roof and giant plexiglass skylight.","Swatara Gap

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572898,"Day 2 of section hiking with my oldest son. We covered 15 miles and he held up in good spirits the entire way. Plenty of rocks and, thanks to last night's rain, plenty of mud, but it didn't dampen our enthusiasm. 
Five miles in at Hertline campsite there is a dammed swimming hole. The source must be a spring because the water was probably 55 degrees. But we took a dip anyway and washed and refreshed ourselves.  I tried out the rope swing a few times, plunging into the bracing depths, while my son counted how long he could stay in the water before it drove him out. Another father and son hiked in from the road to jump in as well. We air dried and changed and got back on the trail. 
We lunched at the Ft Dietrich Snyder monument. In 1755 Ben Franklin oversaw construction of a series of lookout posts along Blue and Kittatinny Mountains to watch for Indian raids during the French and Indian War. This monument marks the site of one. Another was called Ft Franklin, marked by a gravel road of the same name which the trail crosses 40 miles further north.
My son chose a trail name for himself - Phantump, a Pokemon critter that lives in the woods in the form of a tree stump.
The rest of the afternoon passed uneventfully as we hiked along the ridge to Eagle's Nest shelter. We arrived in plenty of time to cook up some mashed potatoes and salmon and some hot cocoa before the thunderstorms rolled in for a second night. This shelter has a huge overhang, new shingle roof, and even gutters so we'll be dry, warm, and safe. All you can ask for on the Appalachian Trail.","501 Shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573051,"Torrential rain overnight. Very glad we stayed in the shelter rather than tenting. A moat surrounded the shelter in the morning. Tossing and turning in the wee hours it was pitch black - couldn't tell the outside from the shelter wall. A storm and new moon and complete absence of artificial light will do that.
Rocketman was at the shelter, also Georgia natives Jibber Jabber and wife River Rock working on the northern half of the trail after hiking the south last year, and southbound section hiker Motel.
The rain didn't let up until 8 so we slept in. The forecast improved with further thunderstorms pushed off into the afternoon so Phantump (my son) and I set off for Port Clinton around 9. Within a hundred yards the trail became a puddle, then a babbling brook, then a raging stream! Partial apologies to Vermud - I mean Vermont: storms can wreak havoc on the trail anywhere, though it did clear up much more quickly here thanks to *ahem* proper runoff control. 
Within minutes of trying to hop around this mess Phantump and I realized there was no chance we were getting through the day with dry feet. So we surrendered to Mother Nature and sloshed through the streams like little kids, having a great time getting soaked. Thanks to wool socks our feet still felt warm and dry (felt!). 
We had an early lunch at a Game Lands gravel road where the sun started to dry us out, then plunged back into the muck. Down a very steep hill into the Schuylkill Water Gap, over the Schuylkill River bike trail, past a trainyard with tourist coaches and huge chunks of local anthracite coal on display, over a very swollen confluence of the Schuylkill and Little Schuylkill Rivers, on into the little town of Port Clinton.
We had been looking forward to a second lunch at the Port Clinton Hotel, but it's closed on Mondays so we contented ourselves with sodas, jelly beans, pop rocks, and chocolate pretzels from the candy store next door. 
Properly sugared up, we labored up the steep hill out of the gap, a thousand-foot climb. From there it was an uneventful few miles with plenty of rocks but few puddles or mud. During many short breaks we examined the fungi, inch worms, slugs, spiders, centipedes, and other critters that often go overlooked in the forest.
By now the sky had darkened and thunder started rumbling. We reached the Hamburg Reservoir and our car, 41 trail miles from where Craig had dropped us off in Swatara Gap. We drove to a local motel to dry out overnight, driving right into the thunderstorm that had been chasing us the last hour and watching it drench the mountain above the road.","Eagle's Nest Shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573533,"Refreshed after laundry, showers, and dried shoes, Phantump and I headed out for our last leg, a loop around the Pulpit and Pinnacle. But first we stopped by Cabela's across Rt 61, the world's largest at 250,000 square feet, and toured the taxidermist's paradise of dioramas of stuffed game animals from pine martens and snow foxes to moose, grizzlies, elephants, and lions, not to mention a massive room dedicated to displaying dozens of trophy buck racks. 
Back on the trail at Hamburg Reservoir, we searched out the Windsor Furnace shelter, chasing a couple false trails. Named after the old iron forge which no longer stands, it looks and smells almost as ancient. No regrets we missed staying here. So up we headed to the Pulpit. From the lot it's a 1000+ foot climb, but spread over a longer distance so it seemed comparatively easy. Chatted with some thru-hikers at the top, one of whom started way back in March. There's an astronomical park behind the Pulpit with three small domed observatories and a neatly manicured sweeping lawn in the midst of this rocky forested peak.
Off to the Pinnacle along the rim trail.  Two miles of level hiking but very rocky. A massive man-made pile of rocks marks the side trail to the Pinnacle and Phantump scrambled to the top. Once at the Pinnacle we took in the gorgeous panorama of rolling farmland, forests, and the Kittatinny ridge going off to the horizon. We could see to Wind Gap, possibly Delaware Water Gap, more than 65 trail miles away. We could make out Bake Oven Knob where we'd been a few days earlier on the practice hike.
We climbed down the face of the rock jumble to a cave that comes back up to the Pinnacle. The walls were still very damp from the storms and the exit was a vertical climb so we returned the way we'd come. We set up the stove and cooked up some mac n cheese right there on the rocks, which Phantump declared to be delicious. 
The final stretch was an easy descent over a forest road, although very muddy and puddly in many places. We left the AT where it branched toward Eckville and took the return trail to the parking lot, winding down past the reservoir.
We celebrated the completion of 47 odd miles of the AT with a trip to the movies in Reading to see Despicable Me 3. 
Phantump was in good to great spirits throughout the four days and proved his mettle as a long-distance hiker. He also signed several shelter logs, so he is now part of trail history. 
This trip along with a couple prep hikes in the spring brings me close to completing Pennsylvania's 230 miles. A two mile spur near Eckville and 21 miles from Lehigh Gap to Wind Gap remain.","Hamburg Reservoir

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574061,"Tomorrow I return to the trail, picking up where I left off in Hanover, New Hampshire and finishing up on Katahdin. My fortune cookie tonight presciently read ""Always a valley before a hill."" Frankly it's the hills I'm worried about! If all goes according to plan I should summit Katahdin on August 25th. I will turn 44 ten days earlier. Seems like my midlife crisis is right on schedule!
I think I will miss Sara and the kids even more on this leg. I struggled with whether to go back out at all. We have only gotten closer in the last month and I want that to continue. I hiked four days with my 11-year-old son, built a computer with my 9-year-old son, went to cub scout camp with the 7 and 9 year olds, relaxed at the shore with my daughter and the boys in Ocean City, NJ and with them and my parents, brother, sister, and their families in Harvey Cedars (thanks again for having us!), watched the kids whirl around on rides at the Kimberton Fair, and just today took my daughter and older boys to the Renaissance Faire in Mount Hope. And best of all I feel closer to Sara now than I have in years. Weeds went unattended and receipts piled up, things I usually obsess over. It's been a wonderful month, and I want it to continue. But reaching Katahdin will be a psychological capstone on this journey and I can then step away with no regrets. I will be able to refocus my energies on all the important things in life, mainly my family. There are still many things I would like to do with Sara and with the kids before winter sets in, not to mention in the years ahead.
So I am all packed up, a process that took almost no time compared to all the obsessing over ultralight equipment earlier in the year. All I needed other than a normal resupply was bug spray (a bigger bottle this time, thank you) and a new pair of Lone Peaks. The old ones had lost traction and padding and were coming apart at the seams after 700+ miles, which seems to be their typical lifespan according to other hikers. The new ones already feel broken in. I'm also bringing my 20 degree quilt, convertible hiking pants, and down puffy jacket, anticipating not only the year-round freezing temperatures summiting Mt Washington but also some cold nights in Maine as summer wanes.
I am excited and optimistic about the trip but with very mixed emotions being away from home. Above all I owe my incredible wife more than I can ever repay (unless she gets the wanderlust herself someday). I am truly blessed to be with her in so many ways. I love her more every day.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574129,"I leave the house early to catch a train to Philly, saying my last goodbyes to everyone. I miss them already! I have to remind myself we'll be reunited before month end.
The Vermonter from 30th Street Station takes 9 hours to reach White River Junction. I spend some of it chatting with a bearded sixty-something pastoral counselor from Lancaster who helps ex-soldiers with PTSD, including drone pilots traumatized by the assassination of families with alleged terrorists they've been tracking for weeks or months (the attack is assigned to the night shift so they needn't do it themselves). In his youth he was a top finisher in the Boston Marathon and invited to train with the Olympic team, and still does long-distance bike rides across places like Maine and Wisconsin. Later it's a Queens artist working in Jeff Koons' Chelsea workshop churning out shiny sculptures like ""Lobster Log"" (exactly what it sounds like) for the famous artist's billionaire collectors. Apparently the most successful artists are more like entrepreneurs, schmoozers and self-marketers who don't have a need for smocks over their expensive suits.
Andrew, a local trail angel, picks me up at the station. He also shuttled me to the motel before I left last month. He's a great guy and extremely accommodating. I hate to take advantage of his time again, but the buses stop running at 6 and there is no Uber or taxi service. So Andrew saves me from the iffy prospect of hitching five miles in an area I've already found to be agnostic at best to hikers.
I get dinner in Hanover before walking the mile to the shelter just outside town shortly before sunset. Not the most grueling start to this section, but I'm sure the Whites have some surprises in store for me so I'll take it.","Hanover
",Velvet Rocks shelter,"Aug 04, Fri",0.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574338,"Up at 5:30 after a night of perfect sleeping weather - cool, low humidity, no bugs. But I tossed and turned all night regardless. Just not active enough yesterday to be tired. 
Malibu is another northbounder in the shelter just returning after some time away. She graciously moved her tent out of the shelter to make room when I rolled in at dusk last night. Her tiny chihuahua Taquito is hiking with her. She carries him sometimes but mostly he walks. A couple of southbounders are here too. According to them this is the easiest terrain they've been on so far. Sounds like I've got my work cut out for me! Yoda, Illegal (from Switzerland), Gaucho, Red Flash, and a few other NOBOs are tenting nearby. They started in mid April or even May. The folks I knew who started in March or late Feb are well ahead.
The trail is easy this morning as the SOBOs said and I cover nine miles to the top of Moose Mountain in just 3 hours. The forest is mostly hemlock later ceding to birch. Plenty of roots and rocks and occasional mud but generally pleasant. 
I walk up into the fog on Moose Mountain, at 2200 feet higher than anything in Pennsylvania but a mere foothill here. As I crest and descend the rain begins. I duck into the nearby shelter just before it becomes a downpour. Others scurry in soon. A retired couple from Georgia section-hiking to Katahdin. Schoolbus, a Tennessee teacher who's section-hiked the whole trail but is here on a side trip to try to do 34 miles in a day. Flash and others from last night's shelter roll in. I leave after the rain lets up and head down the mountain. 
At the top of the next steep mountain, Holt's Ledge, I stop for lunch and watch the clouds drift along a ridge on the other side of the valley. Later I begin climbing Smarts Mountain. At 3250 feet it's the tallest so far in New Hampshire but still like training wheels. 
The skies open up again as I reach a series of exposed bedrock areas, and lightning crashes around me. Not a good place to be in a thunderstorm! A mom and son are up here as well. I stay low as I scurry across the exposed bedrock, hoping I am not an attractive conductor. One bolt seems to hit a hundred yards away. Eventually the lightning moves on and then the rain. I am soaked through and will have to wait for tomorrow to dry out. 
The sun appears as I reach the firetower at Smarts' summit and get an excellent panoramic view of distant mountains and drifting clouds. I check out the Fire Wardens cabin to see if I want to stay the night, but there are already a number of people and it feels very stuffy so I move on. 
I reach Hexacuba shelter a little before sunset. It's a large open hexagonal platform.  Not a very efficient shape for cramming in rectangular sleeping pads. Some folks make room for me. There are SOBOs and NOBOs here. One French girl has a husky sleeping with her. I meet Perfect Pitch again, the young woman from Upper Goose Pond Cabin, still taking it slow but still on the trail.
So I ended up hiking 27 miles when I only planned on 22, despite getting slowed down by the storms. I'm sure this will not be a regular occurrence in the Whites, but it's good to have a little cushion. Tomorrow I hope to reach Mt Moosilauke, where the real fun will begin.","Velvet Rocks shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574352,"It's cool and windy at Hexacuba at dawn and I pull on my down jacket and gloves for the first time since April. The southbounders tell me about the Omelet Man seven miles north, so second breakfast awaits. Plus there's a hostel with cold drinks and ice cream in fifteen. And I decide to go 24 to get to Kinsman Notch and hitch into town for dinner and a bed. That means crossing Mt Moosilauke, at 4800 feet higher than anything I've done and with a descent so steep there are blocks driven into the granite for a mile and a half. The weather should be great so my stomach-centric plan seems foolproof.
I follow Flash out of the shelter. That's the last I'll see of him today. I'm inexplicably sluggish all morning as I climb Mt Cube and it's thankfully dry granite/quartz slabs of bedrock. Great views to the west and north greet me. On the descent I meet a dayhiker who's climbed all 67 four-thousand footers in New England. Now he's working on 25 lower peaks with views (Mt Cube is 2950). Only took him 3 years... 
I reach the gravel road where I was told to find the Omelet Man but it's empty. Bummer! But can't expect a guy to sit there all day every day cooking up omelets for hikers, right? It is Sunday morning after all. So I walk on. A hundred yards into the green tunnel a big tarp kitchen is set up with a man lounging under it with a large boxer dog. It's Carl the Omelet Man! Retired from western Pennsylvania he lives nearby and comes here everyday from early morning to evening so every hiker gets an omelet. He likes to cook and he likes to meet every hiker. Incredible. ""How many eggs you want? A dozen?"", he says in all seriousness. The mind boggles. ""Ha! No, four should be plenty."" ""You sure? The record's 25 - used to be 24 but a German guy broke it this week."" ""Um, okay, make it five then."" Don't want to disappoint him. The boxer leans his muddy paws on my lap and licks me while Carl starts cooking on the camp stove. Ham right off the bone, fresh-sliced onion and pepper, and a heaping mound of eggs tumble out of his cast iron skillet on to a paper plate groaning with the weight. It's gone in five minutes. Silver Lining and Papa John (what his grandkids call him) arrive while I'm inhaling eggs. Neither opts to challenge the record. Carl won't take any money. I thank him profusely and march on.
Re-energized, the miles over Ore Hill and Mt Mist go quickly. Descending Mt Mist I see no white blazes for too long. Have I lost the trail? I keep going, the rule is give it a thousand feet then turn around. Still nothing. There are plenty of trails in the Whites, I must have taken a wrong turn. Check the GPS. GPS says I'm right on the trail. How is that possible? No blazes! Keep walking. Five minutes later there's finally a blaze. Welcome to New Hampshire!
I arrive at Rt 25 and find the Hikers Welcome hostel a quarter mile down. It's quiet, but it's only 2:30. I drain a Coke while I decide if I want to tackle Moosilauke today. It looks imposing, and I might not make the road until after seven. The bunkhouse is new and inviting, as is the shower and laundry. I decide a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. This hostel was my original plan anyway, before my big day yesterday. So I rest up, shoot the breeze, do laundry, shower, scarf down sandwiches from the local deli, and watch Die Hard With a Vengeance (doubtless one of Bruce Willis' finest Christmas movies)
Lots of hikers here, all northbound or section hiking, mostly older. Greybeard, a wisecracking West Virginian on his third wife who says the wife's boyfriend helped pack his backpack is hiking with his hundred-pound Airedale Terrier, Maxx. Pilgrim is here. I first met him in Unionville near the trail in New Jersey during one of my many deli runs. He remembers my egg salad sandwich! He's back after awhile with the family, similar to me. I thought I would never find anyone I hiked with before but with Perfect Pitch that's two already. Bad Hat, Papa John and others pile in as the afternoon ends. Many have or will be slackpacking over Mt Moosilauke. Sounds attractive, but I intend to go further than the pick up point and won't be back here tomorrow. 
Tomorrow, 25 miles to Franconia Notch and then into town? I'll give it a shot. Moosilauke beckons!","Hexacuba Shelter
","Hikers Welcome Hostel, Glencliff","Aug 06, Sun",14.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574501,"Finally a restful night's sleep. There are only two of us on the second floor of the bunk house that can sleep 16. The other is a 77-year-old section hiker who's done nearly the whole trail over 9 years. He complains he's too slow, but just being able to do it at all seems like a win. Speaking of which I'm told there's an 82-year-old named Greybeard (not the one at our hostel) on the trail trying to become the oldest thruhiker (81 is the current oldest).
The others get shuttles to Kinsman Notch for slackpacking Moosilauke southbound or continuing northward. I walk back to the trailhead and tackle Moosilauke northbound. Ever northbound. 
Moosilauke is 4800 feet, my highest peak yet, and the climb from the road is 3800, most at a very steep incline. It looks pretty intimidating on the elevation map, but I find I can keep up a steady pace with few breaks. I pass only a dayhiker on the way up. The trail is initially groomed as if for tourists, but soon becomes a jumble of rocks, headed steeply uphill as far as one can see. As I crest the shoulder of the mountain the ambient noise from the valley drops away and it becomes silent. There's no wind, not even a bird. Finally I break out above treeline. My first time in an alpine region on this trip, and maybe in 25 years. The views are immediately astounding. I can see the entirety of the White Mountains and most of Vermont. There is mostly grasses and ground cover with occasional krumholz (stubby evergreens). Tall rock cairns mark the way. I cross paths with some dayhikers and southbounders on the summit. It's partly sunny and relatively calm, perfect weather. I could stay there all day, but there are many miles to go. 
On the way down I take advantage of the rare cell signal to call home. It's the first day of (home)school for the kids and there are mixed emotions. It's great to hear their voices and to talk to Sara. Being away is hard.
There's a botanist from U Conn by the trail measuring krumholz seedlings. He's here for a week and camped at the shelter down the hill.
On the way down I pass the slackpackers from the hostel. One is Mr. Magoo. He is legally blind and can only make out large objects. He's hiked 1800 miles, falls and turns his ankles several times a day, but he is sunny and optimistic. He's just navigated the extremely difficult northface climb on his own and he's looking forward to lunch at the peak and taking in the view. 
My descent is far steeper than my ascent. The trail follows a waterfall for a mile and a half. It's so steep there are wooden steps driven into the granite slabs in many places. There are at least as many rocks as going up, plus more roots and boulders and mud. And a lot of it is wet. A blind man just climbed this.
Finally I reach the road. I look back while crossing the deserted pavement to see Moosilauke's profile one last time. Just then my ankle turns. Holy crow! I just hiked nine miles over the toughest terrain of my entire hike and I turn my ankle on the edge of the pavement!  It hurts, but it's far from the first time and it's not sprained. Walk on it a bit and it goes away. As I head to climb out of the road a motorcycle roars past then sharply wheels around and stops. The driver calls up if I want some food. Um, yes. Yes, I do. Pretty much all the time. He offers me half a Rachel sandwich. He wants to hear all about my hike. Turns out he hiked 1800 miles of it last year before he quit. His name was Sierra Vagabond. Now he rides his motorcycle all over the country. He tells me about meditation training with Buddhist monks in Oregon, and wants to philosophize on the difference between attention and thought. Seems like a really interesting guy and we chat for a bit, but I'm way behind schedule and wish him well. 
In fact I am way, way behind schedule. The terrain is brutal, and continues to be as I pick my way along Kinsman Ridge. Even though my energy is there to continue, I am simply too slow. The hours tick away too quickly. There's no way to make Franconia Notch, 16 miles away. It's already past two. For the second day I find myself adjusting. Yesterday was a tough call but correct - I wouldn't have finished Moosilauke til dark. Today I just set my sights on a closer shelter. But my carefully laid plans for the Whites have now fallen apart. I was going to resupply in Lincoln tonight. I don't have enough to get to Gorham, 4 days away on the other side of the Whites. New plan.
It starts to rain lightly. Soon the rocks are wet and the hemlocks brush me with water as I pass like a car wash.
The shelter is packed. Silver Lining is here with his hiking buddies. Greybeard, Rocketman and others from the hostel are here as well, after being dropped at Kinsman Notch. I find a tent site. It's been drizzling for a couple hours now and I would much prefer to crawl into the shelter, which looks to have recently been rebuilt. Oh well. I'm still safe, warm, and dry in my tent on the AT, and tomorrow is a new day.","Hikers Welcome Hostel, Glencliff
",Eliza Brook shelter,"Aug 07, Mon",16.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574576,"Dawn comes but I don't want to get up. Drops still fall from the trees and I'm not looking forward to stowing away my soaked tent. Finally I face the inevitable and pack up. I breakfast in the shelter. Nose Flute, a sixty-ish lawyer from West Virginia with a bushy mustache who speaks in a high pitched animated voice like he's hosting a children's science show, demonstrates how he got the name by playing Doors and Stones classics on the nose flute. Look it up, it's unique!
Off I go to reach Franconia Notch, nine miles away. I need to go to North Woodstock/Lincoln to resupply and I will Nero (near zero) there and stay overnight to rest up for the remainder of the Whites and be in position to get to the shelters I want. But Kinsman Mountain is in the way, both peaks, and it is more challenging than Moosilauke despite being only 2000 foot elevation gain. The trail, if one can call it that, is a rooty, rocky, muddy mess. But the real challenge are the car-sized boulders and slabs that provide near constant scrambling, climbing, and tiptoeing down their wet faces. My trekking poles give way to hand-to-hand climbs and I clutch trees as I try to avoid slipping down the walls of rock. At the top of Kinsman I'm rewarded for my efforts with a uniform gray mist. Greybeard and Maxx, Silver Lining's group, and Oompah, a Dutchman, join me in contemplating the blank nothingness. Maxx comes over to beg as I chomp on my granola bar.
There are plenty of other hikers out too. On the way down I meet a young German dayhiker couple who are conflicted about continuing (she hates the rain). Further on there are a dozen hikers of a certain age, part of a hiking group from southern Massachusetts. They love talking to thruhikers, and two ladies pour peanut M&Ms into my hands while another records my trail name for their records. I mention the Silver Striders hiking group from their area, who did trail magic at the foot of Mt Everett. They don't know what trail magic is. So I explain, and they are intrigued. Perhaps future thruhikers will see them again.
My psychological halfway point this morning is the Lonesome Lake Hut, run by the AMC trail club along with another half dozen huts in the Whites. Tourists pay 150 bucks to stay in rustic accommodations and get delicious meals. Thru-hikers stop in after the meals to get free leftovers (the staff doesn't want to pack it out). But some other lucky hikers beat me to it today. Oh well, at least they have delicious cake and lemonade at attractive prices. 
The trail had become easier as it approached the hut. I sped up and became careless and turned my ankle again, more seriously than yesterday. But some Ibuprofen and walking seemed to fix it within the hour. Hopping from rock to rock is an amazing ankle strengthener. Before I took up trail running an ankle turn like that would have left me limping for days or weeks.
The last three miles are relatively easy, though the trail tries to shake us off at one point, pretending to zig one way but really zagging the other across a boulder-strewn creek. I chat with Andre, a seventeen-year-old kid from South Carolina. He's hiking Connecticut to Katahdin on his own. Last year at the tender age of 16 he hiked from Georgia to Connecticut on his own, stopping only because he was homesick. He worked 7 days a week to finish the school year before March. He seems to be a candidate for youngest unsupported solo 2000-miler. He shrugs. It should be remarkable, but out here he's just like everybody else, struggling over boulders and mud.
Finally we enter the Notch, go under Interstate 93 and walk a mile on a paved bike trail to the Flume Visitors Center where my motel, the Inn 32, will pick me up and take me to North Woodstock. While I wait I chat with Paul, a driver from Mt. Liberty motel there for Andre, who fell behind. He confirms it's the height of the season in Franconia Notch with tons of families and day hikers in the area. There's a group of boys here who just finished their hiking trip over Moosilauke and Kinsman. I tell one of them that I've hiked hundreds of miles and that stretch was the toughest I've seen, and he beams. 
I still can't find my ride, so Paul takes me to my motel, even though it's two miles further. The office is closed because they're out looking for me. Soon Carol the owner pulls up, and out tumble 5 of the hikers in Silver Lining's group whom I'd walked down with and who had been fruitlessly hitching the tourists for a ride from the visitor center. Most of them are reserved at still another place, the Notch hostel. These motel folk sure are good people.
This is the first time on the hike I've had a free afternoon in town. I walk the mile and a half over to Lincoln. It's a twenty minute level pavement stroll without a pack, effortless by this point. I eat my first fast food meal on the trail, and see my first trail movie, ""Dunkirk"" (worth your time, though it didn't play out the suspense long enough). After resupplying at the Price Chopper it's time for dinner (can't go wrong with ""authentic Mexican"" in New Hampshire, right?), laundry, and of course a milkshake while waiting for the wool socks to dry. Lincoln and Woodstock are family-friendly and hiker-friendly little mountain towns that don't seem overly crowded even in high season. I wouldn't mind returning with a car someday. 
There are predictably a number of thruhikers at McDonalds, all northbounders I haven't met yet. A guy named Adele is there with his dog Ike. Outside Price Chopper I run into Malibu again, the girl who moved her tent out of the shelter for me four days ago, holding Taquito the chihuahua. She is a couple days behind but came into town from Kinsman Notch. We talk about how you know when you've hiked enough of the trail. 
Everybody I talk to is chastened by the Whites, but also brimming with excitement. It's everything we've been told and more. The southbounders seem sad to be leaving. But the best is yet to come for me. Tomorrow I hit Franconia ridge and Mt Lafayette.","Eliza Brook shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574659,"I have a relaxing morning at the motel as the owners won't be shuttling me back to the trail until 9. Everything has dried out from the rain of the past two days and I leave with a full belly. John drops me off at the Liberty Springs parking lot. There I meet Hobo who thruhiked to Delaware Water Gap last year before running out of money and is sectioning the Whites with a buddy, preparing for another try next year. 
It's a 2800 foot climb up to Mt Liberty, but fortunately more like Moosilauke than the arduous Kinsman climb. I find myself wondering when it's going to get steep. I can do this kind of hiking all day. It's the boulder climbing that slows me down. Yesterday felt like I was shrunk to the size of a bug and dropped into a suburban yard where every little stone is a nightmarish climb or drop. 
I break above treeline at Mt Liberty and am awestruck. The view is spectacular. I can see the whole Franconia ridge and the massive Pemigewasset Wilderness it surrounds. My path for the day circles it on the ridgeline. Words don't do it justice, but there are ample pictures in the photos section. Even they can't convey the scale and detailed beauty of the mountain ranges.
From Liberty it's a relatively easy hike over Little Haystack, Mt Lincoln, and the highest peak of the ridge Mt Lafayette. I pass 5000 feet for the first time. But I don't notice the hiking. The whole ridge is above treeline and the views never stop. The camera rarely leaves my hand. Dozens of day hikers of all ages have made the strenuous climb to enjoy the good weather. A bunch of thruhikers break for lunch on a rocky outcropping between Little Haystack and Lincoln. All northbounders, the SOBOs are few and far between anymore. Dusty amuses us with faux photo shoots of his now Fabio-length blonde hair.
The air is practically still below treeline and merely breezy on the lower peaks. But at the summit of Lafayette (5300+ ft) it is a 50-60 mile per hour continuous gale. This is a calm day. There's a wind shelter for days when it is not calm. Hobo's baseball cap flies off in a flash, seemingly lost to the valley below, but someone manages to retrieve it. I have to put on my fleece, something I've only done on chilly mornings. I can only imagine what Mt Washington will be like.
Again I need to reevaluate my plan. I was aiming to do 20 miles to Zealand Falls Hut. I won't make it before dark. So I shoot for Galehead Hut at the 13 mile mark and hope to get work-for-stay. That's where 2 or 3 thruhikers are allowed to sleep in the dining room and eat the dinner and breakfast leftovers in exchange for some menial labor like washing dishes. You need to get there between 4 and 5 to be allowed in. If rejected you wind up stealth camping as the campsites are too far and the expensive hut bunks are always booked. So it's a gamble to walk past Garfield shelter and hike the difficult 3 miles to Galehead. 
The dayhikers have disappeared but there are still many section hikers here, from families to college kids to elderly couples. I climb Mt Garfield, which looks like a narrow spear on the elevation map - steep both ways. It's a tough but short climb and rewarded by another panoramic view of the ridge I just completed. I can see Galehead hut nestled far below.
I pass Garfield shelter and am now committed to Galehead. The trail gets much rougher with steep boulder climbs and drops and one section that is basically a rock slide with a spring trickling down it. Ah, AT, never change! Finally nearing the hut, I catch up with a hut ""croo"" member packing in 65 pounds of food on a wooden frame backpack that looks very uncomfortable. The nearest road is five miles over rocky terrain. At least one croo member does this every day to keep the guests well fed.
Pilgrim is outside the hut, surrounded by section hiker guests. He got WFS and fortunately after waiting a bit I do as well. No other thruhikers show up. They all stopped at Garfield. The view over the interior valley is wonderful, and only gets better as a light drizzle brings a rainbow cascading into the valley. The guests get a lecture on sustainable power and waste in this off-the-grid location, then file in for dinner. Pilgrim and I wait it out until they're done, then get our leftovers - slow-cooked pork, couscous, bread, and mushroom soup, all made on premises. It's cold but delicious. 
It's Sara's birthday and fortunately I have a signal and get to call her. It's hard not to be there. It makes me happy to hear her voice.
Pilgrim is a twenty-year-old from western Maryland with a couple years of community college. He's not sure what he'll do after the trail but he's not one of those looking to make  it a permanent lifestyle. He'll turn 21 in 10 days and get his first beer on the trail. 
We watch the stars come out from the porch while the guests play board games inside and file off to bed. Then we stretch out our sleeping bags under the tables and let the exhaustion take over.","Inn 32, North Woodstock
",Galehead Hut,"Aug 09, Wed",13
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574771,"I wake around 2 in the morning and step outside the hut to see the stars. The sky is crystal clear but the waning full moon obscures almost all stars and bathes the world in a strong silver light. Earlier the stars were out but there was only a hint of the Milky Way. Guess this is not quite remote enough, or the moon was influencing things from below the horizon. One of these nights I will catch a true dark sky.
Pilgrim and I are up at 5:30 to clear out our junk so breakfast can be served. While we wait the sun rises on the other side of South Twin mountain and takes another hour to show itself. Finally the guests are served and entertained by Monty Python skits and we are called in for leftover oatmeal, eggs, sausage, and zucchini bread. Our chore in exchange is to straighten the bunks and sweep out the rooms. While we work, thruhikers from Garfield shelter start to filter in for water and snacks. 
Finally I'm off shortly after 9. Work for stay was something I wanted to try but it's a mixed blessing. I lost a couple hours in evening and morning and the leftovers, while appreciated, were cold and the items I craved were almost gone (last night's pulled pork and eggs this morning). Plus you sleep on a wood floor identical to a shelter. But it was nice to spend time just gazing over the valley and resting the feet. The huts all seem to be well situated for views.
The climb up South Twin is the first order of business. Similar to Garfield, i.e. very steep and rocky, but 2 or 3 times higher. Still, it goes quickly and the view above treeline is awesome. Again the whole Franconia ridge is laid out, plus the Presidential range to the east with Mt. Washington majestically obscured by clouds. The hues of distant ridges are picture perfect blues and purples.
For several hours I navigate the rocky and muddy ridgeline past Mt. Guyot and Zealand and down to the Zealand Falls Hut. This part is slow going and I become concerned that I may never adapt to be quick enough in this kind of terrain, of which there will be much in Maine. I'm still watching every step to avoid turning an ankle again. 
I pass far more section hikers and weekend trippers than usual. Many are just going from one hut to the other. At 8 miles it's a good day's hike in this terrain. I see a number of kids along the way. Some look like they need a little boost, and I try to lift their spirits, assuring them they've mastered some of the most difficult hiking around. Some college-aged kids and middle-aged section hikers seem to need similar reassurance. One remarks to his buddy as I part ways ""See, I told you this was tough!""
I pass southbounder Caveman. He's making an environmental documentary called ""It's our planet too, dammit!"" and interviewing everyday people along his journey. He's also hiking to raise money for college science scholarships for poor kids. He has a lot of passion and a big heart. Everyone is out here for a different reason.
At Zealand Falls Hut I try their homemade Corn Chowder. It's delicious, and at two bucks a steal. Again all the thruhikers congregate here to eat their lunches, get water, and socialize. I part company and head downhill towards Crawford Notch and Rt 302. I've decided to hitch a few miles north to AMC's Highland Center hostel for the night. The Ethan Pond trail is excellent tread and goes quickly. It's the fastest I've gone since that first morning out of Hanover. I still find time to admire scree fields, waterfalls, and the hidden valleys of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. I dip my head under Thoreau Falls to cool off, and let four yapping dogs lick me when I wander too close for their comfort. As I near the Notch and the parking lot a number of people are walking up to see another waterfall. It's a half mile off trail so I skip it. Can't chase every side trail! I chat with Sunshine and Trail Goose on the way down, both from Bethlehem in PA.  Sunshine started in February and Trail Goose is her support system. They are meeting friends and headed towards a shower and home stay. I scan the lot but see no one ready to leave, so start walking up the road. I get a mile before someone stops. Julie, a local college student studying environmental science, picks me up. She just dropped off two hikers at the trailhead as she heads home to Littleton. I am also on the way. There's only one road in the area so it's not that remarkable. She drops me at AMC's Highland Center. It's a lodge with private bunk rooms and a separate building with a common (and cheaper) bunkhouse. I ask about work for stay but they don't do that down in the valley, only at the huts. A bunk and breakfast is modestly priced, but dinner adds 30 bucks. There's nothing else around here though, so it's either that or my tuna packet. 
The weather is beautiful and I eat outside surrounded by mountains I just climbed on one side and mountains I will climb tomorrow on the other. I feel like I'm turning thru-hiking into a gentleman's sport. As I like to say, I'm hiking the Appalachian Trail, not camping the Appalachian Trail.","Galehead Hut
",AMC Highland Center,"Aug 10, Thu",14.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574854,"Thunderstorms roll through overnight, waking me several times. Better now than later! There's a hot breakfast buffet in the lodge. I chat with Pierre from Montreal who's dayhiking the area for a few days. He offers me a ride back to the trail and I'm quick to accept. Along the way through Crawford Notch we see the Frankenstein railroad trestle high up the hill, part of the tourist line that serviced the old Crawford House resort a century ago. Named not after a mad scientist but a painter who founded the Cincinnati Academy of Art.
I hit the trail at 8:15. The AT follows the Webster Cliffs Trail for most of the way to Mizpah Springs Hut, six miles away and 3000 feet up. At first the trail is gravy, but I still manage to lose it to a deer path for a few minutes. Then it becomes rocky and steep, then it turns into boulders, then ledges, then cliffs I need to use my hands to scale. It takes me two and half hours to climb two and a half miles, my slowest progress the entire trip. I pass a man and his college-aged son halfway up. The man is hard of hearing. ""Ask him how far we've come!"" he tells his son. The GPS and contour map show us at 2400 feet elevation. Mt Webster, the first peak, is 3900, so plenty more to come. The man has section-hiked everything south of here. It's taken him 30 years. His son is joining him now after his old hiking partner had to drop out on Moosilauke. ""I wish I'd started from north to south"", he says wistfully, referring to the tougher terrain to come. I notice as I part that his left arm is amputated above the elbow. I wonder what it's like to hike with one good arm, so I immobilize my left arm for awhile. I find myself trying to wave it for balance as I climb.
There's a great view from Mt Webster across the Presidential range with Washington just under the clouds. Visibility is not as good as the last couple days, but it's good enough. The trail continues to be tough until Mizpah Springs Hut. I trade info with some southbounders along the way. It won't get much easier. At the hut I start scarfing down lunch from my bag and a bowl of lukewarm potato dill soup from the hut croo. A couple dozen northbound thruhikers filter in. I've no idea who most of them are or where they came from. I decide to get ahead of them to ensure I get a place at Lake of the Clouds Hut, five miles away in the shadow of Mt Washington.
I climb over Mt Pierce, take a side trail to the summit of Mt Eisenhower, which brings me back above 5000 feet, and continue on over Mt Franklin. This section is entirely alpine, above the treeline, with commanding views of Crawford Notch. Much of the terrain is just rocks and ground cover. Cairns guide the way instead of blazes. The fog and clouds have been rolling in and a stiff wind, over 50 miles an hour in places, sends curls of fog racing over the landscape. I need to brace myself in the saddle ridge between Eisenhower and Franklin against particularly high winds. I'm still in my short-sleeved shirt and starting to get chilled despite the exertion.
I reach Mt Monroe shrouded in fog and pass up the side trail to the peak. The hut is less than a mile off and it's starting to rain. At Lake of the Clouds there are already half a dozen thruhikers signing up for work for stay. It's only 3:30. I get breakfast cleanup duty, which will delay my departure, but at least I will get fed and a warm place to sleep. More thruhikers stream in. The common room becomes a beehive of activity between guests and hopeful thruhikers. It's cold, windy, and foggy outside. Some of the hikers will get to pay for spots in the Dungeon, a basement bunkroom that earned the nickname for its less than clean and welcoming appearance. Some are in limbo, and many get turned away. Hikers loiter while the hut guests are fed. Then the nine work-for-stay hikers, me included, ravage the leftovers in the kitchen. It's a better meal than at Galehead, warm, and plenty of it. The Dungeon hikers look on hungrily, munching on their Ramen. It's a surreal scene. 
A croo member says they will set a record of hosting 25 thruhikers tonight (previous record was 23). Not only that, they had to turn away 20 more. Quite a difference from Galehead where it was just me and Pilgrim. Another hiker tells me a local hostel, the Yellow Deli, dropped more than 20 hikers off at Crawford Notch this morning. That explains the crush.
The clouds have lifted and we get a beautiful view of the valley and distant ridges before dark. Mt Washington is clearly visible in all it's stark austerity.","AMC Highland Center
",Lakes of the Clouds Hut,"Aug 11, Fri",11
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574943,"Last night after lights out in the common room a group of eight guests stayed and kept all of the hikers awake with lively French conversation and laughter and headlamps for an hour. Even after being asked to keep it down they didn't take the hint. Amazing how they could be completely oblivious (or uncaring) that fifteen exhausted people are trying to sleep around them. 
Despite that I eventually sleep well and I'm up and packed by 5:45. It rained overnight and the hut is completely fogged in. Fifteen other thruhikers are still snoozing on the floor, benches, and in hammocks strung between columns. The croo is making breakfast in the kitchen and guests start to tiptoe through the hiker camp to the bathrooms. Within an hour the place is bustling with guests and thruhikers making plans and eating breakfast. I hang around til 8:30 to get my grub and then straighten up the bunk rooms. There are 96 bunks. It was a full house last night on top of the record 25 thruhikers. While I'm making up bunks the morning fog suddenly blows through and we get a view of the valley and Mt Washington. By the time I'm done chores the fog is back. Forecast is iffy as always up here: moderate wind and temps but possibility of showers and severe thunderstorms. Expect to be ""in the clouds under the clouds"". In other words, no view and you'll get wet.
I leave at 9:30. Work for stay is not the best plan for getting an early start. The hike up Mt Washington is through fog with 200 foot visibility. The landscape is alien, the only living things are lichen and hardy grass. The sun is teasingly visible through the fog. Suddenly the radio towers loom high above. I come up to the summit but can only make out things near me. I get my picture at the summit. As I turn towards the visitor center the clouds suddenly drift away and we get a great view of the valley and Mt Jefferson. There is no 110-mile view but this is far more than I expected. The cog railway chugs up the hill to pick up passengers. The crowds seem thin for an August Saturday and it's a pleasure to walk around. Of course the snack bar gets a visit. It's been, what, 90 minutes since second breakfast?
After an hour of awesome views I reluctantly put the pack on and head down the Gulfside trail towards Mt Clay. The trail follows the rim of the Great Gulf, a steep valley north of Washington. I watch the cog railway cross the trail while I call a hostel in Gorham to arrange a stay. I forget that thruhiker tradition is to moon the railway cars. Just as well. Not sure I could have gone through with that. 
The landscape is entirely alpine as I pass Clay, Jefferson, Adams (Sam, John, and Quincy) and finally Madison. It goes from scattered rocks on gravel to fields of boulders. Adams and Madison look like piles of rubble. Fog swirls around the valleys but visibility remains excellent. At one point I watch curtains of fog from north and south encircle us on Jefferson, slowly closing together. Mt Washington goes in and out of view all day. Jefferson is covered in fog when I pass, so I skip the side trail to the peak. 
I pass innumerable dayhikers and weekenders staying at the huts. Some seem like old hands, others look way out of their depth. I pass only a small handful of southbounders, while playing leapfrog with the same 20-30 northbounders I've seen for the last couple days. 
Amazingly I'm moving fast over this rocky, bouldery terrain, about 2.5 miles an hour. Rock hopping on dry rocks is a breeze. For a while the trail circles Adams and I'm walking at an angle to the trail to stay upright as I hop from rock to rock. I'm loving it as I fly across the rocks. The people I'm passing don't look as thrilled, as they look for flat places to step and find few.
I pop in to Madison Spring Hut for a snack before the last big climb up Mt Madison. It's nothing but a jumble of pointed boulders. It's great. Down the other side it's a little less fun as I worry about a mistep and a twisted ankle or worse. Then I dip below treeline for the first time in 16 miles. The trail takes a nosedive, dropping 1800 feet in one mile. Could be the steepest mile of the entire trail. Near the bottom I meet a group of young campers and their college-aged leaders. They want to climb to the summit, or at least get a view above treeline. I try to tell them what they're in for without discouraging them, but with only a few hours of daylight I don't want to encourage them either. The leaders seem perky, but I'm not sure they've thought this through. I leave figuring the campers look ready to revolt anyway. 
I rush through the seven mile descent from Madison into Pinkham Notch to get picked up by the hostel, which is 14 miles away. I'm flying at 3 miles an hour and passing every thruhiker but I'm too late. So I grab another snack at the visitor center and start walking up Rt 16 with my thumb at the ready. 
A family picks me up. Mom, dad, and grown daughter just dayhiked Mt Washington on the Tuckerman Ravine trail. They drop me off in Gorham, ten miles away. The hostel will pick me up on their return trip from Walmart. I have an hour to get dinner. Belly full of Italian, I'm on my way to the rendezvous point, ten minutes early, and stop to photograph the town. I catch the hostel van in the picture, passing me by! Fortunately Jim the driver sees me - no other hikers on the sidewalks at the moment - and turns around. The van is packed with hikers returning from resupply. We return to Rattle River Lodge and Hostel and I get my shower and laundry and get to relax on a couch for the first time since leaving home. Tomorrow Jim will drop me off at Pinkham Notch and I will march 21 miles across the Wildcats and Carter mountains back to the hostel, which is at the Rt 2 trailhead. The following day I'll continue north and hopefully reach Maine.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575060,"Good night's sleep in a soft bed at the hostel. I woke in the middle of the night for awhile but am still up by 6. The hostel serves a waffle breakfast and then Jim shuttles three of us back to Pinkham Notch where I stopped yesterday. We will hike 21 miles of the AT back to the hostel. Tao (Dao) is a blond tattooed middle-aged guy with Parkinson's hiking the trail a second time, first time since being diagnosed. His meds helped him cruise the southern half but now it's getting difficult for him. He plugs along steadily the entire day, never breaking as far as I can tell. Marshmallow is a forty-seven-year-old Coloradan raised near Wilkes Barre PA. She went northbound to CT then flipped to Katahdin and is finishing southbound. She and another hiker have cars and exchange keys in the middle of each section so they have mobility each night if needed. I wind up hiking most of the day with her as we have similar paces. 
The climb up Wildcat E from the road is steep but no tougher than other climbs in the Whites. But it's slow going. We go up and down over Wildcat peaks D, C, and A. D has a ski lift. No one knows what happened to B. Then we drop steeply into Carter Notch where the last AMC hut is located. It rains lightly on and off all morning and early afternoon, so the rocks are wet, then dry, then wet again. A stiff breeze dries them wherever they're exposed. 
The hut croo just mopped the floor and doesn't seem too interested in selling drinks and snacks to hikers, but I partake anyway. This is the smallest of the huts and it feels cramped. I leave after a few minutes. It's surrounded by two beautiful ponds with the mountains rising above.  
Another climb, now to Carter Dome and Mt Hight where we run into many dayhikers coming up a trail from a closer parking area. The sun has come out again and the views are long under mostly cloudy skies. 
I walk up Carter Dome with Pretty Boy, who was at Lakes of the Clouds Hut. He's from Maryville, Tennessee and just graduated from the University of Tennessee and started hiking from Springer the next day. He and I have similarly aggressive schedules for Maine so we'll likely see each other quite a bit. He's walking because his father was diagnosed with intestinal cancer and he's raising awareness and donations for the MD Andersen center in Houston. He's anxious to finish and return home.
Marshmallow and I roller coaster over South, Middle, and North Carter peaks. Then the trail nosedives into another notch. It is full of boulders and difficult, slippery climbs down. We both slip multiple times. I break a trekking pole for the first time on one fall, thankfully landing on my soft rear end. I'm bummed. I really love these poles and they've saved that rear end countless times. Then Marshmallow pulls her arm while steadying on a tree and thinks her rotator cuff might be torn. I give her some ibuprofen to get her through the last 8 miles. There's no faster way out at this point. As if that weren't enough she then breaks her (only) trekking pole. Truly a dangerous section, especially when wet. 
There's a final climb up Mt Moriah, our tenth named summit of the day. Of course there were at least as many false summits, shoulders of other peaks that due to some arbitrary history were never named. We get more views of the Presidential range and in the other direction far into Maine.
The climb down Moriah is not as steep or dangerous but still very hard on the knees. I'm not used to using one pole and I miss the extra cushioning  and stability. For me the hike starts to drag. I'm reaching mental exhaustion, a dangerous place to be when every step needs to be planned. Thankfully the trail improves after we cross Rattle River and the last three or four miles are sandy with minimal rocks. 
All day I've been under the gun to make it back to the hostel by six for the resupply shuttle to Walmart. I've not enough food to march on into Maine tomorrow. During the Moriah descent it looked like there was no way I'd make it. My pace was averaging under two miles per hour and as of 4:40 there were four miles to go.
I walk as fast as the terrain allows. Marshmallow keeps up. Her arm is feeling better. At two miles out there's only twenty minutes left. Gah! No one can hike that fast! I try to call the hostel, but there's no signal. I'll have to hitch, a difficult multi-segment route no doubt. Then we pass a thruhiker that Marshmallow knows from way back in the south. She urges me to press on without her. The trail is so clear that I start to run. My pack jostles but I find plenty of energy. In fact it's exhilarating and my mental fog lifts. I run almost the whole two miles in less than 20 minutes, apologizing as I blow by two thruhikers, teenage twin brothers, I've been leapfrogging for days. I reach the hostel before six and thankfully the van is still there. I have time to scarf down pizza and a beer courtesy of a section hiker who just completed her hike. It literally takes me two bites per slice.
Jim drives me and two retired section hikers to Walmart where I bump into half a dozen other thruhikers I know. Out front I look for the van. Orphan Andy invites me to join him and tells me Jim came by asking if he'd seen ""3 old guys"" around. Must be the white hair! After resupply at Walmart we drive through Burger King for second dinner and stop at two convenience stores where the section hikers fruitlessly search for Dr Pepper. Back at the hostel it's time for a shower, laundry, packing, and repairing my trekking pole. I bought a cheap set of poles at Walmart that would probably break in a few days in Maine, so I cannabalize a section to reinforce the broken section of my pole, already duct taped back together. Guardian, the hostel owner, takes me into the basement of the nineteenth century home to use his hack saw. Amazingly I come out with a serviceable pole. At least, it will be put to the test tomorrow. I give the other pole to Marshmallow. It will fill the gap until she can reach a proper outfitter.
Tao comes in while I'm fixing the pole. He was prepared to come up short but made it back well before dark. I also reunite with Juggs, a young guy I first met coming out of Duncannon, PA where he started his hike. We've both been off trail for weeks at various times. Strange how paths cross again and again. And I talk with section hiker Shady, a retired Virginian and Dr. Pepper fan who has only 21 miles left to complete the entire trail after 14 years of working on it - unfortunately it's the section I just did today! He and his Tennessee buddy, who completed his own section hike of the AT in 2013, will do it in three days. Very sensible. Shady is coming back from a bad fall on the Mt Madison descent last year. He was hospitalized and still can't turn his head completely. But he's back at it, undaunted. Such is the draw of the AT.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575261,"Two nights in a row on a real mattress. I could get used to this. The breakfast table is full by the time I get down, but the coffee and waffles are bottomless. I'm in no rush today. Marshmallow's shoulder feels better, thankfully. I donate my NH trail map to a southbounder - won't be needing that anymore. 
I head out after having my picture taken for the hiker yearbook by the publisher Odie who happens to be staying at the Rattle River hostel. It's a facebook for thruhikers and long section hikers to contact each other after their hikes. Which is great, because we rarely get around to exchanging numbers on the trail. 
I head out to the trail along some local roads. It's a gorgeous day. In fact, it's the first time I've seen Mt Washington not covered by clouds. At first the trail is pleasant. I pass Roam, a fifty-something lady doing a long Boiling Springs to Katahdin section to finish the trail she started ten years ago. I give her a hand as we encounter a few large boulder climbs. There are great views of the Presidentials from every peak. I also meet a young guy named Waffles who started in Harper's Ferry like me. Then I meet Daypack finishing up his snack. He's a 58 year-old who quit his job 12 years ago after the kids left for college and has hiked the AT three times, the PCT twice, the Camino de Santiago twice, Ireland, Scotland, and soon New Zealand. This is his fourth AT hike and he says it ""accidentally"" turned into a thruhike. He carries a very light pack, hence the name. He is very content with his life and simply loves being out here.
After a while the trail turns difficult and tedious and I am not simply loving being out here. Southbounders warned me southern Maine would be tough, but I was hoping they were exaggerating. It's similar to the Wildcat/Carter stretch yesterday or Kinsman Ridge several days ago. There are lots of rocks, roots, and mud, and often boulder, ledge, and bedrock scrambles. Some places have ladders or steel rungs in the rock. It's not just slow going, the downhills are sometimes scary with wet rock and no obvious sound footing. Again I can't believe that blind people, people with prosthetic limbs, and older people have finished all this. But Daypack and some southbounders today tell me it gets better after Andover, which I should reach tomorrow. We'll see!
There are many small climbs and summits today, maybe more than yesterday but I lose track. Each gives fantastic 360 degree views to the horizon. Near the end of the day as I head for the shelter I watch the sun set over the mountains. 
I cross into Maine in mid afternoon with little fanfare. New Hampshire said goodbye by having me descend a tower of enormous boulders at my own peril. Maine says hello with mud and more boulders. I take off my shirt and attach it to my pack to dry as it's hotter than it's been in a week and I'm not used to it. By evening I find the shirt is gone, torn away during one of the harrowing boulder descents no doubt. I'll use my sleeping shirt tomorrow and get a new shirt in town. That one was full of small holes anyway, and looked filthy even coming out of the wash.
After a punishing day I arrive at the Full Goose Shelter where Pretty Boy and The Kid are eating dinner. The Kid's younger brother is joining him for a few days. They all just went through the same 21 mile gauntlet, and we let off some steam and tell bad jokes. Pretty Boy saw a bear near Gorham so we take advantage of the bear box to store our food bags. I saw moose scat several times on the trail today, something new to this region. It's like deer droppings but larger. It looks like a pile of acorns. I'm told moose use the trails to get around at night. I'm looking forward to seeing one - from a distance!

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575263,"I wake in the middle of the night and force myself to get up and look for stars. But clouds have come through. By dawn they yield to clear skies again.
Today is my 44th birthday. I can't think of a better gift right now then being on the trail. I'll celebrate the day by tackling Mahoosuc Notch early this morning. It promises to be a long day. I want to get to Andover in time for dinner at The Cabin hostel, highly recommended by Marshmallow and Seadog. But I'm to learn that some of the toughest terrain of the entire AT stands in the way. Pretty Boy calls the hostel to reserve a bunk. When they find out where he is they tell him ""You'll never make it! We'll see you tomorrow!""
Can't say no one warned us.
The approach to Mahoosuc Notch is typical of the last two days - steep hills, rocky, rooty, muddy, bouldery. Then it gets far, far worse. Mahoosuc Notch is filled with bus-sized boulders piled at odd angles. There is no ""trail"", just a few blazes indicating a rough direction. You need to use your head to pick the right path for you. Hop across the boulders, go under (in the mud), squeeze between, bushwhack around, cling to a tree and swing around (hoping it holds and doesn't drop you in the crevasse below). You decide. I only felt like I was going to die a few times. That seemed about average. 
This goes on for a full mile. I bang my left knee into rock over and over. My trekking pole keeps getting in the way of handholds, but sometimes it's indispensable. It takes me 75 minutes to get through one mile. Again, close to average. Some take 4 to 6 hours. It's amazing tens of thousands of people have completed this at all. Still, it's exciting and challenging and one of the highlights of the trail. You know you're alive when you're forced to contemplate with every step how to keep it that way.
Exhausted and thirsty after the Notch I am immediately confronted by the Mahoosuc Arm, a steep 1600 foot climb over rocks and boulders. Normally this wouldn't be too bad, it's not even the highest continuous ascent in the last few days, but coming in exhausted I have to take frequent breaks. By the time I reach the top I'm almost out of water and am rationing it until I reach a stream at the bottom. There are great views here and on the sister and higher summit Old Speck, but now I'm so thirsty I'm keeping myself going with the slim hope that there's a soda machine in Grafton Notch state park at the bottom of the mountain. The terrain along the ridge continues to be very tough. The descent is even worse. My knees, hips, ankles, and soles of my feet are repeatedly jolted. My body is tired from tensing as I inch down slabs of rock at angles I could easily slide off. The trekking poles get a workout stabilizing, supporting, cushioning, and helping me down from ledges. Finally, after almost 2500 feet of vertical drop the trail relents and eases into Grafton Notch. I stop at a stream to quench my thirst. I am still bone-weary and plan to lunch in the notch.
Then the most wonderful thing happens. Trail magic! I have never needed it more. Cold sodas and chips! Like the trail knew it was my birthday! Actually it's retired North Carolina hiker Yolo and his wife, up here slackpacking the 100 Mile Wilderness (apparently it can be done with logging roads). They gave trail magic in the most remote section of the 100 Mile Wilderness last week and said some hikers were so happy they cried. 
I suck down three Cokes in no time and hold myself back to leave some for others. But there aren't many thruhikers today. A couple southbounders come through and we swap terrain info and stories. A woman section hiker is trying to finish up Maine, with her husband along for moral support. The Kid and his brother show up. The brother twisted his ankle badly stepping in deep mud and they are getting a shuttle to a clinic. Regretfully I leave them all behind. I have ten miles to go and it's already past two.
The trail going up Baldpate is far easier than that to the south. It's mostly packed dirt with few rocks and roots. Is the terrain so different or did trail maintainers clean it up? But as I reach the Alpine zone the trail becomes pure bedrock. In fact West Baldpate is mostly just exposed bedrock for the last few hundred feet of elevation, hence the name. Walking up the bedrock at up to a ridiculous 45 degree angle is almost surreal. There is nothing like it in the Whites. You feel like you could slide or roll back hundreds of yards if your footing gives way. Dingo, an Australian girl, and her boyfriend appear over the inflection point of the slope like pack mules coming out of a canyon. The views are long and clear from so high above treeline. 
The descent from West Baldpate has me white-knuckling the trekking poles for 1500 vertical feet. The trail is almost entirely bedrock at ridiculous angles. If it were wet it would be a slide. In fact a thundershower has rolled through here a half hour earlier, but it's dried out quickly.
Again I've run out of water climbing Baldpate, first day I've ever run out of water and it happens twice. By now it's too late to get to the hostel for dinner. Pretty Boy is well ahead and is heading for the same hostel. He will call for pickup and wait for me at the road. 
He texts me when he's called them; fortunately I'm at the top of a hill and have service. Unfortunately he's a full hour ahead. We had expected 20 minutes. So I start rushing downhill. It's 4 miles to the road. There's no service at the road so I can't update him on my progress. Fortunately the trail suddenly becomes leafy and mostly clear. I can almost run it. But then the clear sky gives way to another thundershower. It lasts almost an hour. I go as fast as Mother Nature will allow. I make it down in 80 minutes and the truck is still there. Hopper, the driver, said she was going to leave in just six minutes if I hadn't appeared. 
We stop at the General Store and gas station, the only places open at this time in the sleepy town of Andover, so Pretty Boy can resupply. I take the opportunity to stock up on cold teas and get first dinner. I did not have a big lunch what with all the rushing.  
At the hostel, which is in the lovely cabin style home of septuagenarian hikers Bear and Honey, Honey brings out the dinner leftovers - a huge pan of Shepherd's Pie and corn on the cob. We eat in their dining room surrounded by neat pine woodwork, a contrast to the dingy surroundings of most hostels.
Honey, a curly-white-haired Norman Rockwell version of a country grandma complete with apron, has a grown grandchild and 13-year-old great-grandchild living on the property. She's been hiking all her life. She hiked the Mahoosuc Notch not too many years ago. They've hosted hikers since they bought and renovated the house over 20 years ago. They've hiked much of the AT and even some of the PCT. They are well known and loved in the hiking world. Hopper, no relation of Bear and Honey, is a Virginian and perennial section hiker. She comes up every summer to stay with them and help them run the hostel. She proudly calls herself a section hiker. She has never thruhiked, technically. She ""section-hiked"" 2140 miles of the trail in 2014, then completed it the next year. She's also completely section-hiked the trail two other times. 
There are three other thruhikers staying here tonight. One is Floater (her sleeping pad floats in heavy rain), a girl who's been here three weeks recovering from Lyme disease. She didn't show symptoms for a month and by then it required stronger treatment than doxycycline. She's doing better now and will likely complete her hike this year. 
Tomorrow I'm considering taking my first zero after the beating my body has received over the last ten days.  But I will more likely slackpack what I'm told are an easy ten miles to the other side of Andover, return here for the night, and head to Rangeley the following day.","Full Goose Shelter
",The Cabin hostel,"Aug 15, Tue",20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575357,"After getting beaten up in the Whites and southern Maine I am tempted to take a zero for the first time. Instead, I take Bear's offer to slackpack me ten miles to South Arm. It's a compromise that keeps me moving and reduces my guilt while giving me most of the afternoon off to rest.
First Honey and Bear offer us a huge country breakfast - blueberry pancakes, sausage, eggs, fruit, and biscuits and homemade gravy (""That's all the southern boys want"" Bear tells me). I eat too much, and that's saying something. They load up Pretty Boy, Turtle, and Salty Camel with leftovers since they won't be returning.
Hopper drives Pretty Boy and me to last night's trailhead and we set off. Despite the term ""slackpack"" I carry everything I own as I always do. It's easy going for six miles: leafy packed dirt trail that gently follows the contours of the land. Few rocks and fewer boulders and no sharp vertical changes. We make better time than we have in days. We pass Success Pond with an old cedar-shingled cabin that's gone into disuse. Usually these are burned down but this one is being slowly stripped of anything useful like floorboards and insulation.
Bear has asked if I'd mind taking some blowdowns off the trail after Turtle reported them yesterday on his slackpack. I find a few birch trunks I can lug off the trail - gravity helps where it's hillside - and for one that's still rooted in I take out the handsaw Hopper gave me and cut it back. There are some 8 to 12 inch birch logs that will need the chainsaw crew another time. Unfortunately they're four miles from the nearest road so it may be awhile. But overall it's well maintained trail. Bear regularly asks other hikers to change out the toilet paper in the privies along this stretch (an unexpected luxury) and check the shelters and logbooks. Hopper keeps trashcans at the road crossings and collects the bags every day.
In March Bear and Honey were down in Georgia to support Hopper as she was part of a crew carrying a paraplegic along the trail to experience the AT. The couple also annually hosts a group of Wounded Warrior vet hikers with a steak and lobster dinner. In fact today there is one of this group, Matt, recuperating upstairs. He was too tired to come to breakfast but I meet him later. Bear also has a habit of refusing payment from people that can't afford it. He and Honey run this hostel as a labor of love and use their other retirement income to keep it going.   
We break at a shelter where about a dozen other hikers gradually filter in. We don't recognize any of them except for Andre (or Moose) the seventeen-year-old I met near Franconia Notch. He did a lot of miles in the Whites and is on track to finish this month. I ply a 67-year-old local section hiker named Uncle for info on the upcoming terrain. He rambles on in an upbeat decisive tone but ultimately tells me nothing new. The elevation profiles don't look bad, but after the last few days I don't want to be surprised again by difficult terrain.
I'm done by two and Hopper is waiting at the road, handing out popsicles to hikers. She drops me in town for lunch at the General Store and I get a good look at Andover. I finally find Moxie, a Maine-only soda that Sara, the kids, and I love, at Mill's Market. Back at the Cabin I find Bear enjoying happy hour outside the garage and he sends a bottle of white wine around. He wants me to slack the next section tomorrow and come back. He's very earnest, and makes me feel like he's going to miss having me around. I finally convince him I have to move on and he calls his friend in Rangeley to set me up there for the night. Hopper brings in a new hiker, OMG, and Bear immediately makes her feel like family as well. Floater, the girl recovering from Lyme, hiked up Old Blue today and is going to slack the 13 mile section tomorrow Bear wanted me to do. This will be her first major test. OMG will join her. As we file in to dinner Bear confides that he would like nothing else but to get back to hiking himself. A recent stroke makes that very difficult. 
Honey has made a huge spaghetti dinner with homemade meat sauce and garlic bread. Again I stuff myself. Matt the vet explains how his group has become separated out along the trail. He's miffed at one girl in the group, not a vet herself, who just hiked the highlights then summited Katahdin just to be first and presented herself as a thruhiker on social media. It's an interesting question because although thruhiker has a formal ATC definition, hiking the AT is really about hiking your own way and not caring how anyone else hikes. Only you know what you really did, whether you passed every blaze or took a few shortcuts. Some purists look down on slackpacking, for instance, so it's a slippery slope to claim the high ground. Ultimately we are not out here to get medals or recognition, but to find something in ourselves or the world that we didn't know, or maybe have forgotten. If someone wants to brag of an achievement they didn't earn and thus degrade the cachet of being a thruhiker, it only hurts us if we are doing this for external recognition and rewards. The vast majority of the people I've met are not. 
I lay on the bed after dinner to plan tomorrow's hike but am soon asleep. I wake around midnight to pitch black. Outside it's clear and I get my first unobstructed look at a dark sky. The Milky Way and nebulae are clearly visible. I have to focus on individual stars to see all the fainter stars around them. A shooting star passes, flaming out in an instant.","The Cabin hostel
",The Cabin hostel,"Aug 16, Wed",10.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575437,"I wake up refreshed despite (because of?) my midnight star viewing. It's time to move on. Feels like I'm leaving family. We all sit down to another big wonderful breakfast. Honey and Bear insist I take leftovers for lunch.
I had lost my hiking shirt to boulders a couple of days ago. Hopper lets me take one of the cotton loaner shirts they provide hikers when doing laundry as my new sleeping shirt. I will wear my poly sleeping shirt for hiking. She was given the shirt during a hike down south when she needed it, and wants me to pay it forward as well. It has a Celestial Seasonings logo on it. It's the ""tea shirt""! Get it? On the back it has another quote from Lao Tze to complement my journal signature: ""Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."" So true. How does Nature do it all? Delegation...
Hopper drives me out to the South Arm trailhead. I aim to reach Rangeley this evening, 26 miles away. It will be my biggest miles since before the Whites. Multiple folks have told me the first 13 miles are tough - big climbs and descents - but the last 13 are easy. So I figure I'll make up time in the afternoon. The Farmhouse in Rangeley expects me between 7 and 8 this evening. I should beat that.
I start up Old Blue mountain, the biggest climb of the day. It goes smoothly, few boulder scrambles and nice if steep trail. It's quiet and I see few people. I pick wild blueberries on the top of Mt Bemis. They're delicious - but can never get enough! Later, between Mt Bemis' two peaks, I pass Floater and OMG from The Cabin, out for their southbound slackpack. Floater seems to be doing well, in fact OMG is struggling to keep up. I also meet a section hiker named David. He's doing Maine this trip to finish the trail. His wife is slackpacking him every day. She tours the small towns then picks him up and they stay at B&B's. Similarly, I met Girl on Fire yesterday. Her husband is slackpacking her out of an RV. He got lonely with her gone so bought the RV to tag along. She loves getting showers and good meals every night. Her husband will even slackpack her through the 100 Mile Wilderness using private logging roads.
I pass Grey Eagle near a shelter. He's doing the 13 mile section on a recovering knee. He's in his seventies and shows me how his knee swelled up. He suspects cartilage damage, maybe an ACL tear. This terrain is a real test for knees, but he's moving along surprisingly quickly for his age and injury. 
After a final very steep 700 foot climb I reach highway 17, my halfway point, and dig into breakfast leftovers and the bottle of Moxie I carried over all those mountains. It's a lot of food. I'm sitting on a bench by the highway with a gorgeous panoramic view of the enormous Mooselookmeguntic Lake with wind whipping through my hair. Two hikers come up from below. Both have blue shirts and red beards. ""You together?"" I ask, to strike up a conversation. Hikers often bunch up at stopping points so it's not an idle question. ""Yeah, how'd you guess?"" the taller one says laconically. ""You're wearing the same hats,"" I note. ""Very observant,"" he replies, offering no new information. I offer them the blueberry pancakes that I can't finish. They brush it off, then they move on. Two more hikers appear. I ask if they're hungry and want pancakes. ""Do I? That would be fantastic! Trail magic! Thank you so much! This is great!"" Turns out it's a father and son out for a few days. Both are ""cool"" and act like college buddies rather than family. They love the pancakes, and it makes me smile.
Nearby there's a lookout turnoff on the road. Girl on Fire is meeting her husband and the RV. Grey Eagle is getting picked up by his hostel. A woman parks and asks if we're thru-hikers. She's here to meet her son Moose, the seventeen-year-old I hiked with yesterday and in Franconia Notch. It's two weeks since she last came to see him. She was raised in Lancaster county next door to my Chester county.
I move on to the reportedly easy back half of the day. It's already 2:30 so I'm hoping to do the 13 miles at a three mile-an-hour clip. But there's easy and there's Maine easy. This turns out to be the muddiest stretch since southern Vermont. And there are tons of roots and rocks, plus numerous pointless ups and downs. True, there are no huge climbs or drops, but elevation change isn't the main determinant of easy. I can't imagine how anyone who actually walked this would say it was.
Despite the wearying terrain I make decent time and finish by seven. A marathon in eleven hours. Not a Boston qualifier, but then again even the Kenyans would have trouble qualifying in this terrain. It has to get better. Right?
Richard picks me up at the trailhead and takes me to the Farmhouse. He lived in Connecticut until February when he and his girlfriend hiked the AT from there to Maine. It was slow and brutal, he tells me. At one point they had a half inch of snow in their tent from their own breath condensing in the air! They were planning to go to Alaska to drive logging trucks, but fell in love with the Maine mountains and he's been working for the hostel since. 
At the Farmhouse, kids are playing tag in the wide open lawns. Stacy the co-owner has made a mistake and booked me for tomorrow (I suspect when Bear called her yesterday she did not expect me to cover all 26 miles in one day). The bunkhouse is full tonight. Another hiker also wants to stay. It's Blackfoot, a kid I met on my first night on the trail way back in Maryland. He had a shaved head at the time and is now very hairy, but he remembers me as well, probably because I showed up after dark half-dead from doing 39 miles my first day. Small world, the AT. Despite being off trail for five weeks I still run into people I know. I've heard of others nearby but haven't stumbled on them yet.
In any case, Stacy makes good on my reservation by putting the two of us up in their suite. We have three queen beds, a TV, a kitchenette, a couch, a private bath, a private entrance, and a direct view of Rangeley Lake for the price of a bunk. Some upgrade!
Tomorrow I'll see if I can finagle a handoff to their sister hostel in Stratton. It's going to rain all day. If I'm going to hike in the rain, at least I want a dry place to head for.","The Cabin hostel
",The Farmhouse in Rangeley,"Aug 17, Thu",26.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575617,"Good night's sleep at the Farmhouse. Blackfoot is taking a zero and sleeping in. I quietly get ready and go up to the desk to sign up for the 8:30 shuttle back to the trail. I arrange for their sister motel in Stratton to meet me at Caribou Valley Rd, a gravel road 24 trail miles north. It's a reach, but I want to keep on schedule. Forecast is for light showers on and off all day. I walk the half mile to the IGA supermarket to get breakfast and lunch while I wait.
While waiting on the shuttle I talk to a father who is thruhiking southbound with his wife, six-year-old daughter, and nine-year-old son. They're homeschooling along the way. He sees it as the best possible education - on self-reliance and seeing the world up close. I have to agree.
Rain is already starting as I hit the trail. Dropped off with me are two southbounders, Admiral and Renee (Swiss). Admiral keeps asking Renee before boarding the shuttle if he wouldn't rather zero. He lost his poncho and seems very concerned about the rain. Renee assures him it's just a few drops.
For awhile the trail is decent and the rain is merely a nuisance, one I convince myself to enjoy. No point in being miserable. But the trail has other ideas. As I start up Saddleback Mountain a southbounder passes and warns me ""It's crazy up there! So much wind and rain! Shelter in the krumholz!"" I don't understand his concern. It's not a thunderstorm. I've been rained on before on top of mountains. As I continue to climb I pass a dozen college kids on their way up. Why they chose today to climb is a mystery.
Once I break above treeline, which at this latitude is at only 3000 feet, the southbounder's frantic warning makes sense. There are gale force winds and pelting rain. It's cold, and I soon wish I had my gloves handy. I have to brace myself against the wind as I walk. Near the peak it picks up force and howls around me. There is nothing to see, just fog and rain and bedrock and alpine ground cover. I'm trapped above treeline for three miles as the trail winds lazily over Saddleback then dips and climbs over the Horn. I have to dig out my gloves. My hands are numb and I have trouble opening the pack. Lazarus passes as I huddle in a protected stretch digging in the pack.  All I want to do is get out of the wind. It is bone chilling and I am already wet. But there is nowhere to go but forward. 
Eventually we dip below treeline for awhile before briefly resurfacing to cross over Saddleback Junior. I follow Lazarus down to the next shelter. He has a habit of exclaiming his frustration every time he hits a difficult spot - which is constantly. The ups are steep and the downs are steeper. There are long stretches of slippery ledges and bedrock. In fact everything is wet and slippery - rocks, roots, mud, boulders, ledges - every step must be planned. I start to get frustrated myself with the constant obstacles. There's no way I'm making it to my pick up point today.
We collapse in the Poplar Ridge shelter and eat lunch. I share a giant sub with Lazarus I picked up at the Rangeley IGA that morning. Lazarus (""born again on the trail"") is ex-Marines, stationed in Korea and with expeditionary forces. He became an officer and went to Syracuse on the GI Bill. He hears I am an Econ major and asks my opinion of the Austrian economists. He is out on the trail looking for a direction in life.
David, the section hiker being slackpacked by his wife I met yesterday, walks in. He is staying put here for the night. It's not even 3. I have my puffy jacket on but I'm starting to shiver. I call the Stratton motel to cancel the shuttle. Then I call the Farmhouse back in Rangeley about getting picked up at the closer Barnjam road they had offered to slackpack me from last night. It's 75 bucks, but I feel like hypothermia is coming on so I tell them to get me at 5:30 at Barnjam. Lazarus is also interested.
It's four miles to the pick up with no major mountains in the way. I attempt to rock hop across Orbeton stream - the guide says to ford - but the rocks are slippery and my shoes are muddy. I fall in, soaking my shoes and gloves. First time in months that's happened, but they're already damp from rain. There's a gravel road just ahead but the guide says it's not Barnjam and is anyway a mile too soon. A little after 5 I'm making good time and feel I should be close to Barnjam based on the guide. I pass a southbounder, the only soul I've seen. He says, yes, there's a gravel road up ahead. All I see is a completely overgrown dirt logging road that no vehicle could access. The guide notes it too, but as being after Barnjam. As 5:30 approaches I still can't find anything that looks like Barnjam. It's not where my guide says it should be. I walk another mile and find an overgrown gravel road. In one direction a bridge is washed out. In the other it goes on for miles. It's an ATV road, but a 4x4 could drive it. Is this it? Too far north but it's the best candidate. Now I'm starting to panic. Where's my ride? In vain I start walking down the navigable direction hoping to meet my ride. In my mind I run through everything I know. Which road could/should it be? Suddenly I remember Stacy saying last night when offering the slack pack that they can only get you within a mile of the trail. You have to walk in. Oh, fantastic! So when I called today they didn't think to tell me specifically where to meet them? Now I realize I will never find them. It's almost 6 and I'm not fast enough to chase down all the possibilities before they leave. There's been no cell service for miles in this remote stretch.
Furious and panicked at the same time I realize my only course of action is to continue to the next shelter, several miles north. I start climbing Lone Mountain. I indulge in self-pity and wonder why I'm doing this at all. It takes me awhile to calm myself down. I can walk to Stratton in the morning, I reason, only 13 miles. I promise myself a zero the next day. Seems like I need it. Fortunately I'm all warmed up from racing back and forth and the threat of hypothermia seems to have passed.
At Spaulding Lean-To the shelter is full - of people I've never seen before - so I set up my tent for the first time in over a week. Lazarus is setting up his hammock. He was behind me and couldn't find the road either. I crawl into the tent, take off my wet clothes, put on every bit of dry clothing and huddle under the quilt. I doze off while journaling.","The Farmhouse in Rangeley
",Spaulding Lean-To,"Aug 18, Fri",18.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575623,"I don't want to get out of my warm cocoon in the tent this morning. The trees continue to drop water on the tent, though the rain stopped fifteen hours ago. Finally I force myself to change into wet clothes. It's not that bad after the first minute. Wool and synthetics quickly warm to your body temperature even when wet. And today turns out to be much warmer than yesterday. As I breakfast in the shelter chatting with a southbounder, a group of Harvard kids out for some kind of outdoor leadership trip are getting up and chaotically going through all their wet gear, spread out on muddy tarps. I don't think it's the same group I saw climbing Saddleback. God knows how far they got.
The day starts with a 1000 foot climb over Spaulding mountain, typical Maine steep rocky trail both ways. I pass a plaque noting the CCC's work completing the last link of the AT near here in 1937. Their yeoman work is soon apparent. After a rooty few miles the trail dives off the north face of Sugarloaf, known for its ski resort. The trail is literally a 60 degree or higher slope at times, inching horizontally forward with huge steps down the ledges. Much of the trail is still wet. I'm sweating going downhill, exerting isotonic effort to position each step carefully and avoid slipping.
Finally the torture ends and I reach the Carrabassett River. The guide says to ford, but some wonderful soul has set up a plank at the critical point and I easily hop across. The sun has come out and I rest with Lazarus and another young hiker, Uno Socko (one sock), snacking and laying out our gear on the rocks to dry. Haiku, an older Asian woman I passed on the descent, arrives on the opposite bank. I hop over and offer to carry her pack across, but she is just taking a break.
Break time over. Time to scale Crocker Mountain. Even with a break, food, and water, I feel sluggish climbing the 2200 foot ascent. For a time it's as steep going up as the last descent. It ranks with Kinsman and Webster in the Whites and Mahoosuc Arm in Maine for sheer exhaustion. I'm close to done when I reach the peak. Thankfully the trail relents a bit. The hike down to route 27 is Maine easy. Plenty of slippery roots and rocks but no extended crazy climbs or drops. 
A couple of miles from the road I pass the 2000 mile mark for those who started in Georgia. For me, starting at mile 1020, it means I'm close to a thousand miles. It's hard to comprehend. Yet, for all that, I've only moved from the 40th parallel to the 45th. It's a big world.  
It's taken far longer to reach the road than I hoped. Two dayhiker women in the parking lot ask if I just came off the AT and how it is. We chat a bit, but it never occurs to them I might need a ride to town. No worries, I call the hostel and Marching Band (2003 thruhiker adept at guitar, ukelele, and violin) comes out to pick up Lazarus and me. 
Stratton is a compact little town, larger than Andover, farther off the tourist trail than Rangeley, but near the Sugarloaf resort. The General Store advertises ""Nous parlons francais"". I have a bunk in the Stratton Motel's hostel. I arrange to stay a second night, convinced after today's mere 13 miles that my body and mind need a break. After a shower I attend to laundry down the road and a late lunch. Later I catch up with Sara and the kids and hear the progress of their kid-built playhouse. It's been a rough week with the dog being sick but things are getting better. I miss them and am looking forward to getting home soon.
Waterboy is recuperating from Giardia in the hostel. I stayed with him in Gorham and bumped into him in Andover. He drank unfiltered water a few days back and it caught up with him yesterday. This is his second bout with Giardia. Also here are Commando (hikes in a kilt), Vince from South Africa, What's Her Name, Uno Socko and more. The place is full. Haiku shows up and is offered a shower but sleeps in her car. Lazarus is hammocking next to the motel along with a couple tenters. Campers pay less and get a shower and common area privileges. A popular choice for the budget-minded. Also popular is stealth camping at the road and hitching into town during the day. But there are advantages to hiking in middle-age. Affording a bunk is one of them. 
A late dinner at the White Wolf Inn next door turns out to be far better than expected. Gourmet quality bourbon-glazed pork at rural Maine prices. I leave quite full.
Tomorrow is my first zero day. But there will be no sleeping in. The breakfast run is at seven.","Spaulding Lean-To
",The Stratton Motel and Hostel,"Aug 19, Sat",13.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575713,"My first zero day. A day without hiking. I hardly know what to do. The whole point is to rest, physically and emotionally, before making the final push to Monson and then on to Katahdin through the 100 Mile Wilderness. But I feel restless.
After breakfast at the Looney Moose Cafe reading local news and listening to local gossip I wander about town. Flagstaff Lake is nearby and looks very peaceful with the Bigelow mountains - tomorrow's climb - in the background. Flagstaff is Maine's fourth-largest lake at 20,000+ acres, but it used to be a farming valley before the Dead River was dammed in 1949 to control flow on the Kennebec. Forest was stripped and burned and people and homes moved out to make room. Now it's a recreational area as well. Some of the relocated people still live in Stratton. 
Outside Fotter's Market the Lion's club is collecting funds towards placing service animals with disabled vets. I chat with a trainer, who raises one Labrador pup at a time. They're used for dog therapy for vet families as well as deaf and disabled assistance. I dig a little deeper than my pocket change to help out.
A block away the Dead River Historical Society is open for the afternoon. It happens to be Founder's Day for Stratton, and I'm met by Caleb Stevens, the great-great-great-grandchild of the first settler, Caleb Dalton Stevens, who in 1818 bought a hundred acres of lumber tract, built a cabin, leaving his family behind further south, nearly starved to death, but ultimately made a success of it. There were five generations of Caleb Dalton Stevens. The second was also pastor of the church the historical society now occupies. The building is full of antique farm implements, old laundry machines, Stratton High yearbooks from the 20s, toys, cereal boxes, photos, news clippings and more. Quite a collection of 20th century small town Americana. Around the old church are ornate Victorian homes with wood-shingled sides and decorative eaves and turrets, now showing signs of wear. A prosperous place at one time. 
The afternoon passes slowly. I look for postcards but no luck. I top off the food bag at Fotter's for the three days to Monson. I move to a private room for tonight and take a long nap before dinner. I'm taking advantage of town food but feel like I'm overeating without burning it off immediately. I figure I'm storing it up for the next few days. 
Lazarus was inspired by my inertia to zero as well. Turtle and a few others from recent days are floating around. I also run into Falls who I last saw at Lakes of the Clouds Hut. He reminds me we originally met in New Jersey in Unionville, when I met Pilgrim outside the deli. He was off trail for a bit. But again I'm surprised to see someone from one of my previous stints on trail. I'm curious who I'll bump into in the final week.
Tomorrow I hike out over the Bigelows, the last big range until Katahdin itself.","The Stratton Motel and Hostel

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575829,"Back to the trail by 7:30 after a quick breakfast stop at the Flagstaff General Store (gas station). I ride out with Scoop. She's a northbounder getting slackpacked by the hostel. The weather is gorgeous.
There's a cop at the trailhead. They found a dead hiker last night on the northbound trail and will be helicoptering him out soon. They think it was a heart attack. The news doesn't make me think of the dangers of hiking or poor health. It makes me want to see Sara and the kids. No matter how much you love hiking, I don't think you want this to be where it ends. More than ever I feel like I am ready for this hike to be over.
The climb up Bigelow is long but not overly taxing. The terrain is somewhat improved. A couple of miles in I pass two game wardens waiting with the body. A large backpack lies nearby. As I continue up the hill the rescue helicopter swoops overhead, turns back, and hovers over the spot. I march on, trying not to think about it. I text Sara not to worry if she hears the news.
The Bigelows have the last 4000 footers and last 3000 footers until Katahdin. The north peak and Avery peak (named after AT pioneer Myron Avery) are above treeline and have commanding views of Flagstaff Lake, Sugarloaf, and the ridge I climbed up. I break for lunch on Little Bigelow's rocky summit and view the solar eclipse through my sunglasses with quick glimpses. I can see the disk of the moon taking a bite out of the sun. It's about 50% covered, but the sun is not dimmed at all. If I wasn't looking for it I'd never know there was a partial eclipse.
I bump into Matt, the Wounded Warrior from the Cabin in Andover. He's eager to be done with Maine and is pushing as far as he can today. Possibly as far as the Kennebec River 25 miles away. You need the ferry to cross and it only runs from 9 to 2, so it requires some planning. Matt seems to be unhappy despite the nice weather and doesn't seem to be enjoying his hike. 
On top of Avery I meet a girl just out of college with a very large four-month-old mixed breed puppy. She plans to thruhike next year with the dog and this is a practice outing. It's much better practice then I got for sure! She already has her plane ticket  to Georgia purchased for February. The dog is having a hard time and lies down every chance he gets. She will cut this outing short to avoid overtaxing him.
I pass Sunset, a flip-flopper who skipped to Katahdin from Virginia and headed south. She's dreading the southern Maine mountains and Whites, a 200 mile stretch she's just entering. I empathize, and she could be in it for much longer than I was. One day at a time, take it slow, I tell her. I push the slackpacking opportunities in Maine. Her pack looks enormous.
After descending Little Bigelow the trail improves even more. There are still rocks and roots and mud, but there is more leafy and pine needle surface. Instead of 5% nice trail it's 50%. And almost no more ledges or huge boulders to navigate. I make about three miles an hour down to West Carry Pond shelter.
West Carry Pond is a 200+ acre lake once used by Benedict Arnold's army to port boats on their way to attack Quebec. The sun is setting over the hill beyond the lake. Loons cry out over the water. An ATV rumbles in the hills.
I am the only one sleeping in the shelter, while three or four others tent nearby. I'm surprised it's not more crowded, I must be a step ahead or behind the bubble tonight. The tenters are no doubt avoiding mosquitos. There are a few and they like my headlamp and phone screen. One of the tenters is a girl named Rad from Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany doing about half the trail. She wants to visit the west coast before her visa expires.  Another is a middle-aged guy named Bahala-na which means ""what will be will be"" in New Guinean. He's done the entire trail before and large sections since, working on Gorham to Monson at the moment. He's not very chatty so I decide not to ask why he chose the brutal terrain of southern Maine.
Tomorrow, on to the Kennebec ferry and a milkshake Sunset promised me in Caratunk.","The Stratton Motel and Hostel
",West Carry Pond Lean-To,"Aug 21, Mon",23
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575949,"Today is a good day. I'm up and out early and I make excellent time over good, almost flat terrain towards the Kennebec River. The first few miles follow Benedict Arnold's portage trail in his bid to take Quebec. The terrain is good for Maine, but not so good I'd want to carry a bateau over it. I pause at a beach on East Carry Pond. The water looks very inviting and is even warm. But I'm afraid to lose time to drying off. I regret the decision to move on almost immediately.
Ten miles in the first three hours brings me to Harrison's Pierce Pond Camps, one of about 30 remaining of what used to be hundreds of hunting and fishing camps in Maine. Tim the owner is cleaning up from the massive pancake breakfast he serves daily. He offers me coffee and a tour. There's a large dining room and a rustic lodge gathering room with pool table, cribbage board made out of a log, and huge leather chairs. Outside there are cabins and a children's playhouse. Tim's been running this for 40 years. He loves meeting nice people, and tells me everyone who comes up here is nice. He's afraid the increasing popularity of the AT may bring too many people. In spring the fishermen come. In summer there are families and couples looking for nature getaways with canoeing, swimming, and hiking. Pierce Pond, stream, and falls surround the preserved area. A gravel road leads in 20 miles from the nearest town. It looks very peaceful.
I don't mind the detour as I'm ahead of schedule. I reach the west bank of the Kennebec River around 11:30 and wait for the ferry. The ATC doesn't want anyone to ford this 400 foot wide unpredictable river. The undercurrent can be powerful, the channel is up to 15 feet deep today, and when water is released upstream it can rise rapidly. The official white blaze is on the canoe so no one can doubt this is the AT. I sign a release, put on a life jacket, and the ferryman - middle name ""Bird"" - takes me across. He's been busy all morning with 16 northbounders and a few southbounders who were waiting at 9am. Only two can ride at a time. Note for SOBOs: bring a milkshake from the Caratunk B&B if you want to make his day. A pulled pork sandwich would probably work too.
At any rate they work for me. Caratunk is the last town the AT goes through. The Caratunk B&B is busy serving milkshakes and pulled pork sandwiches to a couple dozen hikers. Some are staying the night. I know many of them. Falls who I met in Unionville is here, also Old Soul, a girl from Lancaster I keep bumping into in towns. There's Yoda, who I met the first morning out of Hanover, and later in North Woodstock. Both times I thought I'd never see him again, and he told me the same. He hiked slow, his knees hurt, he was older, shorter, seemed less in a hurry. Yet here he is, actually ahead of me! People will surprise you. They are not always what they seem.
Matt the vet is here. He did hike much farther than me yesterday but he must be taking it slow this morning. He still sounds eager to be done and talks about hiking right past Monson into the 100 Mile Wilderness.
At this stage of the hike most northbounders are preoccupied with plans to meet family or friends at Katahdin or planning their trip home. They all have different target dates and different levels of urgency. Pretty Boy was rushing to meet family and relax with them for a couple days before he summits. Matt is rushing to meet his mom. Lazarus is trying to figure out how to get out of the backwoods and home to Jersey. Yoda has no sense of urgency at all. He'll get there when he gets there. It seems like it's every man for himself, at least as far as hiking plans. No one is going to adjust their schedule at this point to keep hiking with someone.
I hang out for over two hours and have yet another wonderful milkshake, as well as stock up on some lunches and snacks from their resupply store. By the time I leave I feel under the gun to make good time. 15 miles to go to the shelter and it's already after 2. It's supposed to rain this evening. I want to get to the shelter before dark, before I get wet, and before the shelter fills up. And, oh, there's a mountain in the way.
Pleasant Pond mountain is only 2400 feet high but it's a solid 1100 foot climb that brings back some of southern Maine. But it's on a half-size scale, like a trial for southbounders before throwing the full fury at them in the Bigelows and Crockers. Still, the four and a half mile descent is frustrating as it roller coasters up and down. I feel like I've climbed the mountain twice when it finally reaches the creek valley. In my frustration I trip and fall into an uphill section. My trekking pole pierces my hiking pants. That could have been much worse! I try to place every step with care, but when I'm tired my feet don't lift as high as I tell them to and hit rocks and roots. 
Despite tripping I practically fly the entire way to the shelter, motivated to beat the rain and darkness. Even with the steep climb and exhausting descent I average over three miles an hour. I'm drenched in sweat as I enter the tenting area and find out the shelter is once again empty. Almost 29 miles for the day, my longest distance since Vermont.
So, dry, with plenty of light, and with an entire shelter to myself I eat my fancy tuna foil packet dinner. I get water from the stagnant creek, using my scoop for the first time ever. Then I change and get ready to sleep as the rain begins bouncing on the shelter's metal roof.","West Carry Pond shelter
",Bald Mountain Brook Lean-To,"Aug 22, Tue",28.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575962,"It pours overnight for hours. I'm glad to be in the shelter. Packing up and drying out a wet tent is no fun. But I can't complain about the weather. Other than a brush with hypothermia on Saddleback and a lightning storm way back on Smarts Mountain the weather has generally been great for hiking since Hanover. Of course in some places the rocks and roots never dry out, but that's not the weather's fault. In fact the last several days have been too warm and left me drenched in sweat. But the next five days to Katahdin look perfect - partly sunny with highs around 70.
Over breakfast in the shelter - my usual two cups of applesauce - I meet two tenters who are also flip-floppers who started from Harper's Ferry. Once they reach Katahdin they'll fly home to Florida for a week then go back to Harper's Ferry to hike south. At this point another thousand miles sounds unattractive to me even with a week's break. I am completely in sync with the Georgia-to-Maine crowd that is eager to get it done. 
Out I go to make the miles - 22 today to Monson. The trail is not as consistently pleasant as yesterday - unsurprisingly there's more mud and wet rocks - but it's generally fast terrain. Moxie Bald is the only mountain today, and provides another remembrance of southern Maine, slowing me down more than I expect. Must be the humidity. The rest of the day drags with little to distract me but counting down the miles. I scan ponds and bogs for moose with no success. I stumble upon a pair of some kind of game bird up on a bald. They don't move until I'm within a few feet. Once or twice I hear crashing in the brush not far off. Could be a deer, or something larger. Frogs frequently hop across the trail, and the occasional small snake slithers away from this rampaging hiker.
Only a handful of southbounders pass by and I pass only one northbounder, a girl with a giant pack gingerly fording the Piscataquis River. I follow a precariously laid log across instead, but it requires some agility and ledge scrambling up the bank that a heavy pack would preclude. At the other branch of the Piscataquis I walk across a makeshift dam of small rocks and branches that seem to float on the water. So far no wet feet at any of the fords called for in the guide. 
But I stop at a brook to get water and linger too long, listening to it babble and enjoying the blue sky. I presume the trail crosses it and I hop over across rocks. But there's no trail on the other side. I hop back, choosing a loose rock that sends my foot underwater. Oh well, wet socks for the rest of the day. I find the trail further up from the bank on the original side.
In the final stretch towards Monson I cross a dirt road that leads to a trailhead parking lot and find trail magic!  Lucky1 greets me and his buddy puts a PBR in my hand. They're grilling up burgers and dogs. Four others from the shelter last night are already there - the twins, Murphy, and her companion. They've been pacing me since the Whites. The cold beer tastes great and the fat hot dog takes the edge off my hunger that had put food fantasies in my head all afternoon. Lucky1 has 4000 miles on the trail including a 2013 SOBO thruhike. He's doing another hike through Maine this year but took time off to help a friend in Caratunk and do some trail magic. He's ex-Army, took a bullet to the head fighting in Sadr City in Iraq in 2008. His trail name refers to his miraculous survival. Earl Shaffer, the first thruhiker in 1948, said he did it to ""walk the war out of me"". Lucky1 seems to have done the same.
At the road, Ishba, 2015 thruhiker, picks me up for Shaw's hostel. He sought a hostel job to stay close to the trail and thought about opening his own hostel, but is put off by the long hours. Hikers are a demanding lot, for sure. 
Shaw's is a trail icon, serving thruhikers for 40 years. The place is swarming with hikers, some in bunks and some tenting on the lawn. There are lawn games and people lounging around the picnic tables. The current owner shows me around while carrying her baby boy Finn on her hip. Waterboy is lounging on the couch, recovering now from sore knees instead of Giardia. He's 18 years old. As I'm taking care of a shower and laundry I run into the last people I expected to find here: River Rock and Jibber Jabber, folks I met last month in Pennsylvania on a section hike with my son Phantump. We were all sheltering from a sudden rainstorm. The two Georgians were taking it slow and decided to stay put for the night around 11am. Now they've flipped up to Katahdin and finished the 100 Mile Wilderness and have been resting at Shaw's for a couple of days, slowly working on an 18"" gas station pizza.
Gas station pizza is a real thing in Maine. It's good stuff. I get a 12"" buffalo chicken pizza. But I've made no progress since that first pizza I bought way back in Pen Mar park, Maryland on my second day. I still leave two slices and donate them to hungry hikers. In fact there's a scale here and I weigh in at only 155 pounds. I'm probably in the best shape of my life, and eating more than ever, but I can't keep the weight on. I started the hike at 177, well below the 210s I had occupied for years, and even by Hanover I was still 165. My size 32 pants have a cinch strap that is no longer enough to keep them from slipping. My size 30-34 backpack waistbelt can be tightened no further. I'm going to market the ""Southern Maine Diet"" and see how that flies. Of course, three months after I stop and my metabolism figures out it no longer needs to burn 6000 calories a day, I'll be in trouble. 
At the AT visitor center in town there's a register for summiting Katahdin. I put myself down for the 28th. Pretty Boy is down for the 29th. I see Mantis and Family Size, two guys I met on my first day in Maryland, also scheduled for the 29th. Three months and 1100 miles later and we end up in practically the same place, despite my on/off schedule. At the hostel I see Lucky Penny and Already Stinky are checked in, a couple I met and last saw in High Point Park, New Jersey where I clued them in on the free sodas from the staff.
It's amazing what happens when everyone is moving in a one-dimensional universe. You tend to bump into the same people again and again.

Housekeeping note: I will likely not be able to update my journal until after I summit Katahdin on the 28th. There's no wifi or even cell signal in the 100 Mile Wilderness last I checked. In the meantime, Mom and Dad, I will not have been eaten by a bear or fallen in a ravine. Fifty people a day will pass by if I need help. There are logging roads for emergency access. Next you hear from me I will be done the northern half of the AT!","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-To

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576381,"Dawn in Monson. Time to prepare for the Wilderness. I stock up at the gas station convenience store, then head back to the hostel for the generous hot breakfast. Poet, the owner and former English lit teacher, presides over a commercial kitchen grill making eggs, bacon, and blueberry pancakes for 25 hungry hikers. At my table is a family with eastern European accents headed out for the first 30 miles of the Wilderness to an AMC hut. Twice hikers boisterously remind their teenage daughter there's no phones at the table - you have to socialize!
Poet drives the family, Lucky Penny, Already Stinky, myself, and a couple dayhikers to the trailhead. He sees us off with some advice on the terrain and words of wisdom encapsulated in his own haiku. In I go. There's a sign warning of the extreme remoteness of the area, that you should carry ten days of food, and help is far away. Poet tells the thruhikers to ignore it. After all, he shuttles food and people into various trailheads within the Wilderness daily.
Despite the name, there's little different from the last section south of Monson. Beautiful ponds and lakes, rocky, rooty, generally level trail. I cross several rivers the guide says to ford, but can rock hop them all. It's great weather today with cool breezes on the mountaintops. But in the 100 Mile Wilderness there are more section hikers, and even dayhikers. Seven miles in I pass people I breakfasted with at the hostel, going... south? ""Poet dropped us off at the parking lot a mile off trail ahead and we're doing a short day back to Monson,"" they explain. Well, so much for remoteness. Maybe I'm just too close to town.
I cross over railroad tracks, then woods and logging roads. Twenty miles in I run into a woman with a daypack. ""There's a parking lot .8 miles off trail ahead,"" she explains. Well then. Maybe there's a McDonald's too?
The Chairback mountain range looms up in the late afternoon. It's five peaks have some steep, rocky climbs and tough, frustrating descents. I lose my patience once I get to ""Mt Three and a Half"" and start talking smack at the mountain. What self-respecting mountain has a name like ""Three and a Half""? It's between me and a good night's rest.
But overall the day goes quickly. Despite a late 9am start I get 26 miles in by sunset, ten and half hours later. Racing sunset to the shelter stresses me as it always does. I hate to hike in the dark. When I see Chairback Gap Lean-To a few minutes past sunset I let out a Hallelujah.
Waterboy is at the shelter. He left Shaw's last night and walked to the first shelter. There's also a flip-flopper currently headed south to his pivot point at Bear Mountain on the Hudson. They are the only thruhikers I've seen since leaving Monson. It seems like they should be thick on the ground this time of year. Waterboy thinks there's a bubble ahead of us. I frequently hear there's a bubble ahead or behind. I'll know if I catch up to it.","Shaw's Hostel
",Chairback Gap Lean-To,"Aug 24, Thu",26
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576549,"I wake at 3:30 and force myself out to see the stars. Don't have many chances left. It's a clear night with no moon. But too many trees. The Milky Way seems faint even though the stars are clear and numerous.
A cold breeze blows when I wake at 5:30. The shelter is on the side of Chairback Mountain. I roll over and sleep another hour. I'm not on the trail until 8 or so, with 29 miles planned. Waterboy decides to give it a go as well.
Chairback Mountain is rocky and takes a while to get down. I pass yet another road accessing the Wilderness. Hostels offer food drops to hikers who don't want to carry a week or ten days worth of food. They even slackpack hikers between roads - for a price. I pass dayhikers a few times. There are parking lots within a mile of the AT in a few places and some popular dayhiker loops. Not as remote a Wilderness as widely believed.
Yet the typical thruhiker gets no outside support or contact. Southbounders just starting out may take ten days to get over the 100 miles, even longer as with River Rock and Jibber Jabber. Hardened northbounders typically do it in 5 or 6 days. My plan is to get through in 72 hours. The call of civilization, cold drinks, ice cream, burgers, and a soft bed is strong.
I lunch at a shelter and see that Pretty Boy was here today. I thought he was two days ahead of me. Waterboy thinks there is a bubble of northbounders just ahead of us.
We climb White Cap Mountain and its four peaks. These are the last steep extended climbs until Katahdin. They go quickly and are less rocky than the Chairback range. White Cap is the last 3000 footer (or 2000 footer for that matter) before Katahdin. On the far side we get our first glimpse of Katahdin itself. A huge bulking mass standing by itself with its peak in the clouds. My first thought is that it's too close. It looks only 20-30 miles away, but is some 70 trail miles away. The trail zigs and zags in the final approach.
At the Pleasant River I try to rock hop across. It's wide and shallow but the rocks are too widely spaced. I find a path, but slip on one rock and soak my feet anyway. Everyone else changes to camp shoes and fords. An older southbound couple with a dog laden with food packs crosses.
Waterboy and I chat to while away the hours. He's 18 from Charlotte and is a line cook in a fine restaurant. He's been working since he was 15 and finished high school early with good grades, but is not interested in college. He's moving to Breckinridge to work in a ski resort kitchen over winter and earn money to hike the PCT next year and the CDT the following year. He wants to finish the Triple Crown of US hiking before he's 21. He left behind a girlfriend who he just found out couldn't wait any longer. 
We pass a few southbounders, including a woman and her grown niece. It's getting late in the year to start a southbound hike. They'll be hiking well into winter. We pass only one northbounder, Kentucky Straight. At a shelter a Wilderness section hiker with a long white beard is napping while we get water. We chat but excuse ourselves to get 12 miles to the next shelter before sunset, less than four hours away. He shakes his head. 
It's a crazy plan but the terrain becomes easier and we make good time. We're both exhausted when we reach Cooper Brook Falls Lean-To by the roaring brook, fifteen minutes after sunset. At least a dozen northbounders are here around a fire in front of the shelter. I've caught up to Pretty Boy at last. We chat about summiting Katahdin and post-hike plans. A German named Sweetheart doing the AT on visa also plans to do the PCT next year. I don't get to meet everyone as I'm scarfing down some dinner and they begin filtering back to their tents. Again the shelter is underused. Just fine by me.","Chairback Gap Lean-To
",Cooper Brook Falls Lean-To,"Aug 25, Fri",28.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576672,"It's cold again this morning, 46 by the thermometer in the shelter. Another breakfast of poptarts - I don't think I will ever eat them again - and I'm off at 7 with Waterboy close behind. Bangles, a fifty-something woman who started in Front Royal and the only other occupant of the shelter, was up and out well before dawn, headed to White House Landing.
Today promises to be more relaxing than the last two days. The terrain is flatter and I'm told less rocky and rooty, and I have more time to get the miles in. I'm aiming for a shelter 30 miles away or a campsite 34 miles away, to be in good position to exit the 100 Mile Wilderness tomorrow and get to the base of Katahdin.
The trail is easier, as promised. It passes a number of large ponds and lakes. It also crosses several gravel access roads, including one with two cars parked and one driving by. I stop at a shelter to rest and meet northbounder Ropeburn, a young man with a Thor-like blonde beard who likes rock climbing, and his girlfriend Bugs. 
Waterboy and I hope to stop at White House Landing for lunch. It's a backwoods camp like Harrison's where you hike a side trail to Pemadumcook lake and the owner comes over with his boat to pick you up. But Waterboy calls and finds out the owner is only interested in overnight guests like Bangles. So we walk on. 
I break for lunch at a campsite where they are building a new shelter. The frame and walls are up but the platform and roof are to come. There is a lot of maintenance work evident in Maine, from new stone staircases to planks and stepping stones over bogs, much more than other states. Yet there are still many deadfall trees across the trail that have obviously been there awhile. The chainsaw takes lower priority it seems.
I'm eating more than I thought and drinking more as well. I upgraded from carrying 1.5 to 2 liters of water but I am still refilling it a couple times a day. My food is running thin, but it's enough to get to the Abol campground store tomorrow and resupply for the final day of summiting Katahdin. I suspect my hunger/thirst stems from the consecutive big days I've been putting in, and the fact I've only been in town one night in the past week. In fact I've logged almost 160 miles over the last six days. I figure I'm burning about 7000 calories a day. My tuna packet advertises it's only 80 calories, though it's protein-dense. Nuts, cheese, chocolate, and crackers make up some of the deficit.
On Nesuntabunt Mountain, one of the last climbs before Katahdin, I get a close view of the final destination. It's only sixteen air miles away. It dominates the horizon. 
It's getting late in the afternoon, I'm tired and eaten almost all my food for the day. I have to scrub the 34 mile option and aim for the closer shelter. It's still a stretch. The terrain seems to get worse just as I need a break. Lots of boulders, rocks, roots, side hill walking, and up and downs. Waterboy is waiting for me up ahead at a section hiker's campfire so he can share the misery of the last few miles with someone.
Finally we tumble into the Rainbow Stream Lean-To, where several southbound hikers are gathered around a fire. Squid, a flip-flopper Bucks County kid trained as a welder and reluctantly headed for the Navy, an 18-year-old true southbounder from Hawaii getting a late start, and a flip-flopper couple hiking with their dog. We eat and chat but it's off to sleep shortly after dark. Another big day lies ahead. The final full day of hiking.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-To
",Rainbow Stream Lean-To,"Aug 26, Sat",29.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576674,"Squid is kindling a morning fire as I wake at 5:30. It's the first fire I've had in the morning. Getting up to the cold isn't as hard the third or fourth day. I've learned to keep my hiking clothes in the sleeping bag. I hike out in my puffy until I warm up. There are a dozen or so tenters around the shelter, a mix of section hikers and NOBOs. I am one of the first out, a little before 7.
The miles pass quickly and I push on to take advantage of my morning energy. The terrain is stubbornly difficult - ""Maine easy"" because there are no steep climbs - with boulders, mud, and roots, roots, roots of every shape, size, and angle. 
I pass few hikers in either direction. The 100 Mile Wilderness is a popular section hike but it's still early. There are no southbound thruhikers except the Hawaiian kid at the last shelter. 
After 15 miles and a lot of counting down the distance I finally exit the Wilderness on a gravel road and enter Baxter State Park via Abol Bridge, a rickety, dusty, one-lane affair traveled only by campers. A family is walking the bridge to take in the spectacular view across the river to Katahdin. A fly fisherman in the foreground makes a photo worthy of a travel brochure.
Just as spectacular after four days in the wilderness is the campground store and restaurant. I have a big lunch and I resupply for dinner, breakfast, and snacks for the next day's summit. A number of northbounders are doing the same. I chat with red-bearded Scout at the lunch counter. Waterboy finally gets his resupply. He ran out of food yesterday from overeating and I gave him my jar of peanut butter. 
A Baxter state park ranger tells me there's still room at the Birches, the shelter at the base of Katahdin reserved for long distance hikers. I walk the mile into the park to sign up for space. Ghost Hiker comes up to register. She's a retired fiftyish Tennesseean who has section hiked the AT and is doing a flip flop thruhike this year out of Harper's Ferry. Her kids are grown and she will be back on the trail in Harper's Ferry in a week. She hiked the 300 mile Benton McKaye trail in the south earlier this year just to get her hiking legs. She always stealth camps and avoids shelters, hence her name.
I take my time on the ten miles to the Birches. I take in Big Niagara Falls for awhile, perched on a ledge next to the roaring gush of water. My energy wanes. Little hills tire me out. I eat all my snacks. I stop at Daicey Pond campground and get another commanding view of Katahdin across the water. Finally I walk into Katahdin Stream Campground and register for my summit permit at the ranger station. I'm only the 501st northbounder to reach Katahdin. Over 3000 started in Georgia, plus hundreds more flip-floppers farther north. Probably three in ten will make it this far. September will be the busiest month. The ranger points me a quarter mile up the road to the Birches. A minute after I start walking another ranger driving by offers me a lift the short way down the road. I happily jump in.
There are nine other hikers at the Birches. Wood Pile and Workout are building a fire. Waterboy is setting up his hammock. Planter, Brown Sugar, and Sasquatch are hanging out, along with a 50-year-old retired flip flopper. Ghost Hiker doesn't like the shelters, she finds tenting space with a family at another campsite. We eat our resupply goodies at the rare picnic table then shoot the breeze one last time around the welcome warmth of the fire until dark, reminiscing about funny events or personalities on the trail, and what awaits us after trail life. Tomorrow is the culmination of months of effort for everyone here. It's a bittersweet moment. No one can quite articulate how they feel. 
The crescent moon appears, setting in the west. Eight o'clock is hiker midnight and everyone slips off to bed. I judiciously douse the fire with what little water I have.","Rainbow Stream Lean-To
",The Birches at Katahdin Stream Campground,"Aug 27, Sun",24.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576991,"Sasquatch and I share one of the shelters at the Birches. Most folks are tenting. ""Squatch"" wears a size 15 shoe but is about my height. It's chilly again this morning but the day feels different. Today is a day hike up a single mountain. There is no further destination. Waterboy and the retired flip-flopper are already gone. The rest of us eat breakfast in relative silence. I use my last tuna packet. Better than poptarts.
I've decided like most people to leave the bulk of my belongings at the ranger station and carry only water, snacks, first aid, and foul weather gear in my pack up Katahdin. I've never slackpacked until now. But I want my memory of today to be of an enjoyable hike, not the pride of carrying an extra ten pounds.
I start up the Hunt Trail, as the AT is known here. I'm told it's the most difficult path to the summit. Naturally! It winds through the campground and gradually up to Katahdin Stream Falls where it crosses the gorge on a narrow footbridge. Several hundred stone steps lead above the falls, then give way to a long, steep boulder scramble, still below treeline.
I pass mostly dayhikers, including several families. Some, especially the kids and teens, are doing well. Others are huffing and puffing, often looking like they came right from the couch. Most of them will make it anyway. One fit-looking man is on metal crutches and swinging a stiff left leg over each boulder. He's working hard and perseveres through stumbles. I don't want to pry so I just exchange greetings. The scramble gets only more challenging higher up and I don't see him again. That he even got this far is amazing.
I pass Rocketman, and later another Rocketman. Neither is the retired rocket scientist Rocketman I met in New Jersey, or the young Rocketman I met with my son in Pennsylvania. The first is a section hiker I met at Hikers Welcome in Glencliff. He's with Greybeard, the wise-cracking West Virginian. They've skipped up to Katahdin and will then hike south. Maxx the giant Airedale is absent as dogs are not allowed in Baxter state park. 
I pass Platter and Brown Sugar, girls from the Birches. Now above treeline, I catch Squatch and am passed by Scout from the diner yesterday. We are surrounded by incredible views of lakes, forests, and mountains. The horizon is so distant it fades into mist. We're now on the ""spine"", a steep column of boulders and ledges with nowhere to go on either side. I pass a sixty-ish dayhiker who looks wiped out. He complains about his hip and thinks he'll have to turn around. He's eager to have a sympathetic ear.
As I reach the Gateway to the Tableland I catch up to and chat with the other Rocketman. He's joined by his two grandsons for the final leg of his thruhike. I snap a photo for them while they wait for his son to catch up.
The hard part is over. It was a fun and challenging climb. Now the relatively level Tableland spreads out like a Martian landscape. A small spring named after Henry David Thoreau, an early visitor, bubbles up and pools over the rust-colored earth. The trail leads upward over rocky ground towards the peak. Waterboy is coming down. His journey is now over and his mom is waiting for him at the bottom. He was a good companion for the last few days. I wish him well in Colorado. I look forward to hearing about his future adventures. 
Up ahead is a completely unexpected rendezvous with River Birch, who I met in Vermont when he was out for the weekend with his thruhiker buddy. He planned to join his friend for Katahdin but the friend summited earlier than expected last week. How strange that I should encounter him on both of his brief excursions to the trail.
The weather is perfect. Almost no clouds, and the air is practically still, even at the peak. Workout, Woodpile and a few others are already there, snapping pictures and congratulating each other. I climb up the sandwich board-style sign for a photo. I can see to the hazy horizon in every direction. I wish there was a guide to tell me what I'm looking at. Somewhere to the northwest is Canada. There are few mountains other than Katahdin's own subsidiary peaks. A narrow ridge of rocks called the Knife Edge leads east towards one. I gaze over the gulf on the northside at a pond far below. A dayhiker named Bob is sitting quietly in the commotion. He points out Pemadumcook Lake, which spreads across the southern view, where he has a summer cabin. Five times he's summited, he says, and this is the first time he's had a view. I realize we are all very fortunate to be finishing today.
Greybeard arrives. He comically rips off his shirt and climbs the sign for a he-man picture of his droopy frame. ""That's going on the cover of AARP magazine!"", he says, speculating his future fourth wife may see it. Squatch, Brown Sugar, Platter and the remaining thruhikers finally make it and pose for numerous group shots. Dayhikers coming over Knife's Edge are gleeful to encounter newly-minted thruhikers. The buzz grows loud with dozens of people milling around. The height of the season is just beginning. I can see why Baxter state park trustees are cracking down on large group celebrations. It's crazy enough with random collections of individuals.
I could absorb the view and the moment all day, but after an hour and a half it's time to go. Dayhikers are still coming up as I gingerly make my way down the spine. I pass the hiker with the hip problem again. He's given up and is headed down. Now there's a problem with his camera. I nod sympathetically. Soon after I lose the white blazes amongst the enormous boulders. What a place to lose the trail! The mountain drops off steeply on either side. Two Swiss thruhikers Jukebox and Cooper come up behind me and decide to plow ahead anyway. Fortunately we discover the trail ahead. The Swiss guys practically race down the mountain. I keep up most of the way. The most precarious stretch is behind us. Now it's just hopping and jumping down from rock to rock. It's an adrenaline rush. The elevation drops away and before long we're below the falls again. I slow to a walk. This is my last mile. No reason to hurry through it.
I grab my tent and other deadweight at the ranger station. Then I run into a final taste of trail magic in the campground parking lot. Courtesy of an older couple who hiked 400 miles in the mid-Atlantic section last year and are here for their second attempt to summit Katahdin. Pretty Boy and his new trail family are sitting in a big circle in the middle of the lot enjoying sodas and snacks. They will summit tomorrow. With him are Mantis and Family Pack, two of the first hikers I met as I left Harper's Ferry. It seems like a lifetime ago. They've been on the trail almost continuously while I've been on and off. What a coincidence to meet at the end anyway.
It's 24 miles to the nearest town, Millinocket, where I'll spend the night. It is so remote the only transportation out is one bus a day from the next town over. As I reach the park's gravel main road Ghost Hiker jumps out of a truck. She came down the alternate Abol Trail (shorter and arguably easier) and got a lift back to pick up her things. The driver is none other than Bob from the summit. He offers to take me halfway to town, to a diner where I can get another lift. His home is nearby. I cautiously accept, not seeing any other options at the moment. Bob tells me he's retired and lives 7 months on Pemadumcook Lake and the balance down in Portland. He usually climbs Katahdin with his granddaughter. But now she's 18 and had to leave for college early for volleyball team practice, so she climbed it in July with friends. I can see now it's been a bittersweet day for him. 
We see two hikers thumbing as we inch down the gravel road (Baxter's grant forbids paved roads). I recognize Ropeburn and Bugs, and Bob stops. They've been trying to get in touch with her parents who are coming from Wisconsin, but without a cell signal they are headed to town hoping to find them. They jump in.
Five minutes later, just past the main gate, Bugs recognizes her parents' car passing us. Bob honks and pulls over and they are reunited. Bob and I continue on, now on paved road. We pass Bob's turn off and reach the diner, but Bob decides he's got nowhere to be and will take me all the way to town. He just needs to pull over and find a cell signal to call his wife. It's only twenty miles out of his way!  
Millinocket is the largest town since Hanover, but the main drag looks more like a ghost town. Bob tells me it used to have forty thousand residents and the largest paper mill, Great Northern, in the world. Now the lumber goes elsewhere. Tourism is the main industry. In one unmarked storefront park rangers are bent over plans for the recently designated and locally controversial Katahdin Woods and Waters national monument. 
I check in to the AT Lodge hostel. Ole Man, the owner, tells me they sent out 550 southbounders this year, far more than the 200 of recent years. He credits the movies Wild and Walk in the Woods. He notes Walk in the Woods was supposed to release in 2004 but halted when the original lead Paul Newman died during filming. Newman made friend and director Robert Redford promise to finish it. Twelve years later he did, playing the lead himself.
It's a mile out of town but I decide to skip the local pizzeria and walk to McDonald's. In the next booth is Mike Hoen, the hiker from Katahdin with hip and camera problems. He works crazy hours and this is his first day off in a long time. Between diabetes and the hip he's upset at not being able to summit. He offers me a ride back to town. I ask about the knight emblems on the car and he tells me he's a direct descendant of a Knight Templar through his French / Nova Scotian ancestors.
Back at the hostel an Israeli woman is making herself dinner. Her son Jaws is summiting tomorrow along with her husband. They are at the Birches tonight. She and her husband have been hiking with Jaws since Manchester, Vermont but she has no interest in climbing yet another mountain, even if it's Katahdin. Her husband is American and she has lived here and gotten green cards twice only to give them back. Never interested in citizenship. She prefers Israel, but says the only mountains in Israel are near war zones.
It's busy now at the hostel. All the hikers from the summit are here or at the pizzeria. It's time for celebration, but old habits die hard. The bar is empty and hiker's midnight is eight as usual.","The Birches at Katahdin Stream Campground

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582670,"Beautiful day. I'm dropped off at Lehigh Gap by John ""Mechanical Man"" Stempa who hosts hikers at his home as well as shuttling. He talks the whole ride over. He was a ski fitting mechanic for years at a local resort. Outfitted Mario Andretti and family, who live nearby. Stempa hosted Earl Shaffer when at age 79 he made his third thruhike in 1998. Now Stempa is trying to get Greybeard to stop there as he becomes the new oldest thruhiker, wrapping up his flip-flop hike in Pennsylvania this month.
I'm hiking 21 miles north back to my car in Wind Gap to fill in my last large section in Pennsylvania. This will also complete the entire Harper's Ferry to Katahdin section. I've been looking forward to the climb out of Lehigh Gap as it's been compared to the Whites for it's steepness and challenge. It turns out to be brief and underwhelming though. But for a minute or two there's a section requiring hand over hand bouldering that brings back fond memories of New Hampshire and Maine. Then there is some slow lateral going over rocks before I hit the ridge. Once up on the ridge the walk is pleasant and overlooks the compact main street of Palmerton and the old zinc works that has defoliated much of the mountain, now a massive Superfund site. A few miles in I meet Sarah coming south from John Stempa's home where she overnighted. She left from Katahdin in late June, on track for a mid-winter finish in Georgia, a prospect that seems to concern her. While we chat Frisbee flies by heading south. Sarah introduces herself. He says briskly ""Yeah, we met at the omelet guy's"", (he means up in New Hampshire, back in August presumably). Frisbee's making up Pennsylvania which he skipped in his Nobo thruhike that ended Sept 19.
I hit plenty of rocks in this section - this seems to be one of the worst stretches in Pennsylvania - but after Maine it's barely a bother. I can only imagine what southbounders must think of the seemingly wild exaggerations of northbounders once they encounter the comparatively mild terrain south of the Whites.
After retrieving my car in the late afternoon I squeeze in a 5 mile out and back from Eckville before dark to cover the last tiny section of Pennsylvania I missed. I meet several young men from Switzerland looking to camp nearby and direct them to a streamside campsite a half mile north. There's an enclosed shelter with running water and shower just down the road, but they came out specifically to rough it. I don't think they know the significance of the trail they're on, it was just a convenient trailhead.
No one else is on this stretch this late in the day. And just like that it's done. I complete the last bit of the AT from the Virginia border to Katahdin - 1169.5 miles in about 57 days. 
I have many memories of this journey, but the ones I treasure most are the days I hiked with my daughter in Maryland and my son in Pennsylvania. I hope they remember them as well, as I look back on the trips I took with own father so many years ago.
I don't yet know when or if I will complete the AT. Certainly I want to and intend to, but life has many other things awaiting my attention. Only time will tell.","Lehigh Gap

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582672,"Three months after summiting  Katahdin I've put about ten pounds back on, despite running several times a week. 15-20 miles a week makes for some good workouts but is only a tenth of what I had been hiking. Still, climbing countless mountains has improved my fitness to the point of dropping my mile run time close to seven minutes and shaving four minutes off my 5K time. Just yesterday I ran over 20 miles in three hours. Maybe I'll get that marathon in yet.
I longed to return to the trail for many weeks after leaving. I had no illusions of finishing the trail this fall, but I wanted one more week, maybe in Shenandoah. I told myself it was just a psychological effect of being out there so long and like a sugar craving it would fade. It did for awhile, but I still find myself at odd moments looking for a way to get back out there. Freezing weather seems reason enough to put such thoughts aside, but spring is not far off and my subconscious won't let go. 
It's not as simple as a desire to finish the trail. I would be happy to hike the same sections again. The attraction is the simplicity of life, the constant activity and vigor, the personal connections, the glories and challenges of nature, the comforting daily rhythms broken by the adrenaline rush of occasional peril, the feeling of independence and control of one's destiny. 
It's hard to see how I squeeze this in between work and family but I need to try. This is now an important part of my life. I know that once out there I'll complain about the rain, the heat, or the cold, I'll rush to get to camp before dark, I'll feel guilty over pausing too long in any spot lest I fall behind schedule. I'll long for restaurant food and despise what's in my pack. I'll dread setting my tent up if it's wet. It's so much more comfortable curled up in a chair in my living room, reading any book I want, the fridge nearby and my car at the ready. But even knowing all that, the pull is just as strong.",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Sat",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582671,"I hiked this section of central Pennsylvania last spring as a practice run but never logged it. Today I hike it again and make it my official time. It's  below freezing when I hit the trail before dawn but once up the sun shines all morning. The thousand foot climb up to Dan's Pulpit goes quickly, except for the part where I manage to lose the trail, twice, going almost a mile out of my way. The giveaway is when I start to head downhill, to the northwest. This feels vaguely familiar, like I made the same error last time.
Other than that the trail is a piece of cake. Sure, there are plenty of rocks which at one time would have driven me nuts, but now I accept them as part of the experience. No views other than Dan's Pulpit, and the forest is dormant with barely a squirrel moving, but it's extremely quiet and peaceful. I pass only one other hiker the entire day.
I turn back south at route 309 after 11.5 trail miles to return to the car. At the Allentown shelter I break for lunch and enjoy the stillness. I've eaten almost every bit of food by the end of the day. At three miles per hour I'm keeping a better pace than I expected. Maybe I haven't lost my hiking legs entirely. Though the southern mountains will certainly be slower going. Whatever the pace, I better pack plenty of food.
Yes, it's true, I hope to return to the AT. If possible I will pick it up from Springer and finish in Harper's Ferry this spring, hiking north with the thruhikers. There will likely be some breaks to be with the family for important events.
Finishing what I started is an important part of my motivation. And I'm not just talking about the miles. This journey is therapy in a way. I've made some important discoveries, but the job is unfinished. There are more connections to be made and more barriers to overcome. I feel this journey is changing me for the better. Last summer I thought I was done because I was tired - physically and mentally. But I realize part of this was due to the demanding schedule I held myself to. I was never emotionally done. And it took only a few weeks for my physical and mental stamina to return. 
If last year was about peeling off calcified layers and breaking down hardened ways of thinking, there is much rebuilding still to be done.
Everyone on the trail is searching for something. Something they've lost, something they've never had, something they thought could never be. It seems ironic that one would travel thousands of arduous miles to find something that ultimately resides somewhere in their own head. But if it were easy to unlock everyone would have done it by now. I look at it as insight must be earned, if only because we will value it all the more.","Eckville

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583967,"My target date to pick up the hike at Springer is April 15. For those just joining, this is the second half of my wraparound hike (Harper's Ferry to Katahdin, Springer to Harper's Ferry). I did the northern half last summer and summited Katahdin August 28th. You can read all the gory details in my previous entries. 
I'll take a train from Philly to Gainesville, Georgia and arrange a shuttle to Amicalola. I plan to do the approach trail like the white-blazin' carry-every-ounce purist that I am (well, except for the long hiatus here and there - hike your own hike!). Looks like a wet and cold start to the season and I hope everyone out there stays safe and warm, if not dry! I expect continued cold nights in April. Although it regularly dropped into the 30s as I approached Katahdin last August and my summer bag kept me warm enough, I plan to bring the 15 degree quilt until I am through the Smokies at least.
By the way, I've stopped referring to this as a thruhike and even changed the journal type to ""section hiker"". The ATC says completing the trail in twelve months in any sequence counts as a thruhike. Although I'll technically be pretty close to that, maybe 20 days over, and it's true that since it's on the honor system there are inevitably some, perhaps many, recognized thruhikers who don't meet the ATC's definition (due to aqua-blazing, yellow-blazing, etc), my being off trail for longer than most people take for a whole thruhike seems like too much of a stretch. But ""section hiker"" doesn't feel like a good fit either. Most section hikers are out for a week or two, covering 50 or 100 miles. Several hikers I met last year were doing hundreds of miles and referred to themselves as a LASH (long-ass section hiker) or SLASH (super long-ass section hiker). Not very appealing either. When I'm done ATC will record it as a section hike because it's either/or to them, but on the trail I think I'll avoid labels and just say ""I'm headed north"".",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Sun",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584533,"The hikers down south have encountered plenty of late season snow and ice in the highlands. But here in Pennsylvania I took the kids skiing Saturday at the local resort, which was trying to keep the slopes open for a final weekend. The man-made snow half-covered the slope, and gradually turned to slush as the day wore on. The daffodils are pushing up and the maples are budding. Surely spring has arrived.
But not on the AT! 
I arrived at Lehigh Gap before dawn for a conditioning hike with full pack. My goal was route 309, a little over thirteen miles south. To save on shuttles I would hike back to the car. I've dayhiked this section before but not all at once. I started under clear skies in the high 20s and kept my puffy on awhile. The climb up to the George Outerbridge shelter (named for an early thruhiker) went quickly over the barren rocky zinc-contaminated Superfund site, followed by a couple miles of leafy uphill trail. There were a few inches of snow above 1300 feet but the trail was trodden down or melted for the most part.
But what I'd forgotten is this section is probably the rockiest in all of Rocksylvania. It includes Bake Oven Knob, Bear Rocks, the Knife Edge, and plenty of anonymous stretches of metamorphic glacial deposits. Usually the rocks don't bother me - this is my backyard and I'm used to it. But snow-covered rocks add another dimension! You wouldn't think a hundred feet of elevation would make much difference but along the top of the ridge where the rockiest bits are the snow was significantly deeper. I followed the tracks of hardy hikers before me to find safer footing. I planted each foot with care, especially coming down where the trodden snow had turned to ice. Thankfully the diciest stretch along the Knife Edge was clear due to the southern sun. If nothing else I discovered my Lone Peaks are not too shabby in snow and ice.
The last two leafy miles to 309 were a welcome break. Little traffic, and I crossed the road to symbolically connect this hike with the section I hiked in January from Eckville to 309.  Yeah, I'm the guy that exits a shelter the same way I entered so I don't miss any trail. Then I immediately started back north. A couple miles back I had spotted a fire ring with a rock bench and a wonderful southern view that would make a perfect lunch spot.
Anyone who says there are no views along the AT in Pennsylvania must not like rolling farmland. The quilt-like landscape had patches of brown fields edged by hedgerows and offset by darker sections of forest with a distant border of low blue hills. The ridge was silent the whole way, except for the distant traffic on the turnpike where it tunnels under the mountain. No wildlife or wild flowers made an appearance today.
I passed several locals around Bake Oven Knob, and one backpacker near Ashfield Gap, most likely out for practice judging by her clean gear, though she showed no sign of slowing down to chat. As I negotiated the rocky ridges I knew there wouldn't be anyone along anytime soon if I got into trouble.
I made it back to the car by 4:20 after averaging a very respectable 3 miles an hour considering the slow going on the rocks. But I was wiped, and short of breath from sucking in cold air all day. On the drive home I heard the forecast for a foot and a half of snow over the next two days. Happy spring!
Weighed the fully-loaded pack yesterday sans food and water. It's crept up from 12-14 pounds last year to 17 now. I added back the stove and cookpot, some warmer camp clothes, and the EE quilt (only 24 oz, but heavier than my summer bag). I'm also carrying the ""tea shirt"", which Hopper gave me during my stay at the Cabin in Andover after I had lost my hiking shirt to the rocks on Baldpate. I promised I would pay the gift forward by passing it on to someone else who needed it, as she had been gifted it herself. The trail will decide if I have the opportunity.

One housekeeping note: I'm changing this journal to a 2018 hike to make it easier for people to find. I don't know what trailjournals etiquette is, but it seems backward looking to think of this as a 2017 journal. Let's just say my fiscal year starts in June (gotta love accountant jokes!)","Rt 309

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585786,"Start date has shifted slightly to April 16th. I'm very excited to get back on trail but I'm going to miss the family terribly. Spending this time trying to minimize home maintenance, bills, and other distractions for them in my absence. My wife is taking on a lot for me to do this, especially with a new puppy in the house, and anything I can do in advance to make it easier I will.
I shook down my pack and reweighed everything to see what I really need. Caution says to take winter gear through April and into May, so I'll be a few pounds heavier at first. But at 16 pounds without food, fuel, and water I can't complain. With fuel, 3 days' of food and 2L water it comes to 27 pounds.

Almost everything held up with only minor scuffs for over a thousand miles, so I'm optimistic it'll hold til the end. I finally repaired my jerry-rigged trekking pole (snapped descending Carter Dome in the Whites) with an OEM replacement tube, instead of the temporary cheap-Walmart-tube-and-duct-tape band-aid. I love my poles! They've saved my butt on countless occasions. Plus they give my arms a workout other than stuffing my face.
I tried (oh how I tried!) to find a better shoe to replace my Lone Peaks. I call them my clown shoes thanks to the splayed toebox. They got me through the toughest terrain on the trail but I hoped to find something with better traction and that would lock my foot in more securely. But after a nasty blister from one alternative, and feeling like I was on stilts in another shoe with a large heel-to-toe drop, I remembered why I had settled on Lone Peaks in the first place. Nothing comes close in comfort, especially after 20 or 30 miles over rough trail. I'm hoping the 3.5 version not only lasts as long as my two pairs of 3.0's did (700 miles each), but doesn't start separating after a few miles and look like hobo shoes. Not that it would affect whether I wear them. Appearance ranks about #6392 on the list of hiker priorities.
I did pick up a buff to replace the neckerchief I never used. The buff can be a headband, hat, scarf, balaclava, sun cover, and a dozen other things. Still working on getting the do-rag option right!
Once on the trail I'll be updating this journal daily. If I don't post by 10pm it's because I have no signal. It will go up when I reach a summit or town the next day. I also load 4-5 pics a day into the photos section with captions. I hope you enjoy following along. I know I will years from now when I'm too old to hike anymore.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586451,"Four days til I relaunch on the AT! Last summer I hiked the northern half. Now it's the South's turn, starting from Springer Mountain in Georgia. 
I'm eager to see what the trail has in store for me this year. Last year I experienced the awe-inspiring beauty of nature from the rapids of the Potomac to the bogs of New Jersey to the alpine peaks of New Hampshire and Maine. I crossed the Hudson at 120 feet above sea level and summited Mt Washington at 6300 feet. I was continually humbled by the kindness of strangers, and the earnestness and friendliness of hikers and locals alike. I met people of all ages and backgrounds, each with unique stories to tell. I was blessed by trail magic when I stumbled upon an abandoned sleeping bag miles from anywhere at a time I desperately needed one. I hiked through stifling humidity in New York and awoke to near-freezing temperatures in Maine. I was soaked to the bone innumerable times, dodged lightening on top of a mountain in New Hampshire, and fought off tropical storm-force winds, freezing rain and hypothermia on another mountaintop in Maine. I watched molten sunrises over lakes and twinkling sunsets over alpine balds. I jumped in ponds and waterfalls on a whim, and stumbled through hundreds of miles of mud, roots, and rocks. I hiked 39 miles my first day and was rewarded with terrible blisters. I gazed 120 miles to the horizon in every direction more than once. I pushed myself to exhaustion day after day with dawn-to-dusk hiking, yet found time to drop into quirky and quaint towns like Duncannon, Port Clinton, Delaware Water Gap, Unionville, Ft Montgomery, Kent, Salisbury, Bennington, Manchester, Hanover, Lincoln, Gorham, Andover, Stratton, and many more. I ate gourmet sea bass on the summit of Mt Greylock in Massachusetts, feasted on home-cooked meals at The Cabin in Andover, Maine, and competed for leftover scraps in the huts of the White Mountains. I ate an entire half gallon of ice cream in one sitting on a chilly Pennsylvania day, then ate a big dinner an hour later. But mostly I ate tuna and poptarts.
Notice how this reminiscence ended on food?
Unlike most thruhikers I've had a few months in the middle to reflect on how I could get more out of this experience. But, like most reflection, there are no black-and-white epiphanies. Still, there are some changes I want to try in the South.
1. Learn how to enjoy camping. I am a hiker first. I like to keep moving. I'd often hike sunrise to sunset (during the long days of summer!) Ending my day at a shelter at 3 in the afternoon was unthinkable. I would tell people ""I'm hiking the Appalachian Trail, not camping the Appalachian Trail!"" So I've resolved to use camp downtime to master some skills and make it more interesting. Knots. Fires. Story telling. Bear bag hanging. Practicing my high school German on unsuspecting foreign hikers.
2. Exercise daily. I am horrible at keeping a regular routine at home. Use the routines of trail life to my advantage. I'm talking about upper body exercise. My legs will be getting plenty already!
2a. Stretch daily. Ditto.
3. Experiment with camp cooking. I may be limited by my one pot setup, but I can surely improve on tuna-mixed-into-instant-potatoes.
4. Take more detours. Ambitious daily goals meant I often passed on side trips that didn't involve food, like that waterfall half a mile off trail. I walked through all of Maine without even hearing of the Gulf Hagas trail, which goes through the most spectacular canyons along the entire AT corridor. Now I have a list of must-see blue blazes (side trails) annotated in my trail guide.
5. Slow down and smell the roses. This will be my toughest challenge. Even as I write this I am unwilling to commit to it. Stop, sit, and enjoy the moment. The miles will come. They have never been my problem. My personal challenge is not to rush through this unique journey. 
So if you see me rampaging down the trail with blinders on trying to reach the next shelter before dark, please drop me a note in the guest book to remind me of my trail resolutions!",,View Entry,"Apr 12, Thu",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587032,"My overnight train from Philadelphia was massively delayed when it stopped dead for 4 hrs in Virginia due to severe thunderstorm, tornado, and flash floods warnings. It was a fitful night but I'd make up for it at the shelter tonight.
Since the delay messed up my plan to grab breakfast in Gainesville I walked to the dining car. I was seated with a woman from Iran who moved to LA, went to school to be a flight attendant in 2001, and couldn't get a job with an airline after 9/11. She's now a set designer in Atlanta, which is apparently the ""new Hollywood"", where up to 90% of scenes are actually filmed.
Bret ""Suches"" Eady was amazing to rearrange his shuttle schedule to pick me up once the train finally arrived in Gainesville at 11, four hours late. Bret thruhiked southbound last year. He used to be in shipping and moved recently to Suches, Georgia, just off the trail. Very nice guy and I highly recommend looking him up.
As we drove the 38 miles to Amicalola State Park I watched spring fully bursting in North Georgia. Lots of color and all the trees are leafing out.
We arrived at Amicalola around noon and I went into the visitor center to register my hike. I'm number 2277 this year, which is about 23% more than at this point last year. Since not all hikers register their hikes, the true number will probably exceed 4600 northbounders by end of May (compared with 3850 last year). Master Splinter, a 2012 thruhiker now with the ATC, gave a brief but excellent seminar on staying safe and following Leave No Trace on the trail. In a few weeks he's headed to work on the trail in Maine for the rest of the season. In my class were a man and a woman from LL Bean who were the first leg of a relay hike of the entire trail. They will pass off a stuffed moose to the next LL Bean team in 10 days.
The Approach Trail to the AT trailhead on Springer Mountain is 8.8 miles and starts with 600 steps up Amicalola Falls. The falls are the tallest in the East and make for quite a show. Halfway up I spied a chrome bumper half-buried under the stairs, then the rest of the outline of an ancient Volkswagen, acting as a giant planter. Some example of Leave No Trace! Probably built the stairs before the car was revealed by erosion. But what a story it must be on how it got so far up here in the first place!
It was quite cold and windy today. There were flurries and trace snow on the ground at elevation along with hoar frost covering all the branches on summits like Woody Knob.
I saw only a few hikers on the trail. Passed Rob and Brandon, sixtyish guys moving very deliberately. Stopped in at Black Gap shelter and shot the breeze with ex-Army Johnny Boy and electrician Shane. Singin' Dave came in to repack his things. I eventually got my butt in gear and hiked up to Springer, where the trees were covered in hoar frost, and took some selfies with the bronze plaques for the record. Singin' Dave caught up with me and we hiked together to Stover Creek shelter three miles downhill. He's a medicinal chemist from Boston and is hiking to Fontana Dam, having done everything else but Maine over the last decade. Along the way we passed a couple of Georgia trail club volunteers headed south to Springer shelter. A big thank you to all the people who volunteer their time to make the trail safer and more enjoyable!
Coming off Springer we ran into a lean energetic lady who had just finished the Pinhoti Trail from Alabama, several hundred miles. It connects to the AT and they are collectively known as the Appalachian Mountain Trail. She is doing an Alabama to Maine thruhike!
At the shelter I cooked noodles and hot chocolate to wash down a cold spicy salmon wrap. Met Chris, hiking to Damascus, who was huddling in a polyester blanket. This is his second day. Didn't want to get out of his warm sleeping bag til 4 today so only went three miles. Medicine Man (a pharmacist) is making his second thruhike attempt after getting as far as New Jersey with his son a few years ago. Several others were tenting. 
A chill wind sent us all to our sleeping bags before dusk. I put on all my warm layers as the temperature will be below freezing.
No AT&T signal here - though Medicine Man found a Verizon signal by walking a half mile uphill - so I'll post this tomorrow.
Safe, dry, and warm (enough!) On the Appalachian Trail...",,Stover Creek Shelter,"Apr 16, Mon",2.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587090,"It's 30 degrees waking up at Stover Creek shelter, but thankfully my water hasn't frozen. I crank out a few pushups to warm up before changing into my (cold) hiking clothes. We shelter-dwellers busy ourselves with breakfast chores and enjoy the sun rising over a clear blue sky. I cook up oatmeal, then can't for the life of me find my spork. Not looking forward to eating it with my fingers! Finally the spork shows up in another bag I had strategically placed it in without telling my brain.
Singin' Dave hikes out early. Don't think I'll see him again. He has only seven days to get to Fontana Dam before his vacation ends, and it's over 160 miles away. Tom, who rolled in late, also leaves early and I won't see him all day. Meanwhile I leapfrog up the sunny and increasing warm trail with Medicine Man and a few others.  I meet Todd, who started the trail yesterday on his 55th birthday, and we stop to take in beautiful Long Creek Falls. Todd sold his business as an exercise equipment repairman in Michigan before hitting the trail. Still Debatin' is another hiker getting water from a stream as I pass. He couldn't decide on his trail name, so that is what he got! I also meet Matthew, a young guy with his terrier/dachshund Maybelline whose short legs make her a ""12-mile dog"" and naturally limit him from overexerting his ACL-torn knee. He hopes to work and earn his way up the trail. I pass by two ladies-of-a-certain-age: M-Squared (Marilyn from Maryland) and her partner Queen (real name Regina). Queen will finish her section hike of the AT today when she reaches Springer six miles south. I also stop to chat with Dean and Bethany having lunch at an overlook. They camped at Stover Creek with us. Later while I am sitting next to the trail taking advantage of a cell signal to post yesterday's journal, Dave and Brittany come by, who I last saw in the ATC class at Amicalola. Few people have trail names yet.
Later on I cross over Sassafras and Justus mountains. These are stiff challenges for many new hikers and I can see why. Down at Justus Creek I stop for water and meet Fortnight, whose vacation limits his trips to three weeks a year, and Mitchell, a young kid sporting American flag gaiters (debris protection worn around the ankles). At Gooch Mountain shelter I stop at 3 for a late lunch and debate whether and how far to continue. It's been 13 miles already and the next campsite is another 8. I meet Dave and Patrick who are also itching to press on. Patrick is a 22-year-old biology major headed to U Penn for dentistry. 
I decide to hike out. The weather has been ideal all afternoon and it promises to be a pleasant if chilly evening. After a few miles I reach the top of Ramrock mountain where there is a small tent site with an amazing overlook across the north Georgia foothills and ideally positioned to enjoy sunset and sunrise. Perfect! I dry-pitch the tent (footprint and fly only) before Mike from Saginaw, Michigan climbs up. It's easy to convince him to stay, he's ready to be done for the day. We're later joined by Jason, who works in Arizona for the Apache tribal government. After cooking up some potatoes, I get a fire going in the fire ring. It doesn't put out much warmth with the wind blowing but it's very relaxing. The sun sets over the hills we've just climbed. As the chill sets in we head off to our tents for the evening.
Safe, warm(er), and dry on the Appalachian Trail!",,Stealth site on Ramrock mountain at mile 19,"Apr 17, Tue",16.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587199,"Last night we saw a beautiful sunset through the trees. This morning I eat my oatmeal while Mike and I sit on the rocky outcropping and watch the foothills gradually bathed in golden light as the sun rises behind a hillside.
Jason is worried about being low on water, as our tentsite is dry and he didn't carry much in. So I give him most of my water to make breakfast. He's hiked a lot of mountains in Arizona and feels pretty gung-ho about pushing hard early on. Mike is feeling yesterday's miles in his feet, as am I. So I find myself dispensing trail wisdom that I didn't follow myself, like go easy in the beginning and listen to your body. I did the same thing yesterday for an older lady named Laura who's done lots of dayhiking in far-flung places like Central America but never any backpacking. Still, she's already planning a circuit around the Himalayas after the AT because Nepal is so cheap.
I hike out at 8 and reach Woody Gap shortly where there's an older couple with a pickup checking out the view. They ask where I'm headed, then the guy pulls out a couple water bottles from the truck and hands them to me. When he hears I'm going to share them with my buddies up the trail, he pulls out enough for everyone! They get in the truck and pull out before I think to get their names, but I'm very grateful for their generosity. I dump my trash in the picnic area bear-proof receptacle, then leave two of the bottles behind a rock facing the trail for Mike and Jason and head north. 
Up on Preaching Rock I sit in the sun awhile taking in the foothills view.  Ducky walks by going south. From California, and a former PCT thruhiker, he's nearing the end of his 500 mile southbound section from the Grayson Highlands in Virginia to Springer.
The next few miles are sidetrail around the peaks. I see sunny hillsides abloom with wildflowers - great white trillium, bristly buttercups, blue violets, and purple wild geraniums. I know this only because of an app I downloaded that holds a database of southern plants and an intuitive filter by color, number of petals, etc. That and my PhD in botany, of course! As I get up from my analysis I see two deer tics have landed on me and flick them off before they dig in. If the wildflowers are out, so are they.
Nearing Blood Mountain I'm low on water, but the only source is at Woods Hole shelter almost half a mile off trail. Meh, not walking a mile off trail when it's only 3.5 to the hostel at Neel Gap.
On the way up Blood I meet a French hiker named Bernois who's been  dubbed, by creative American hikers, Slow French. Asking him about the trails in his country he extolls the beauty of the 10-day Mont Blanc circle through the French, Swiss, and Italian Alps. I'm too embarrassed to try my meager college French on him. Maybe later.
There are several hikers on top of Blood around the stone shelter. No one sleeps here because it's in a zone that requires carrying a bear canister, and it's usually cold and windy. There's a good view from the top of a large ledge nearby. The climb up was challenging in places but not very long. There are lots of stone steps, and near the top some bedrock sections that remind me of NY or NH.
The way down, however, reminds me more of Maine. It's steep and full of boulders and sharply angled bedrock. People are taking their time. I'm enjoying it however, how odd is that? So I bounce down the couple miles to Neel Gap. 
Along the way I hear the story of Charzetard, a guy who nearly burned down Black Gap Shelter on his first night by turning his stove all the way up then freaking out and kicking it off the table, whence it rolled under the shelter, set someone's Frogg Toggs (rainjacket) on fire, and only went out after prodigious amounts of dirt were kicked onto it. Charzetard goes stoveless now!
Neel Gap is the first milestone for northbounders. There's an outfitter and hostel here. But they're mostly busy heating up frozen pizzas for a couple dozen hungry hikers. It seems almost everyone I've met ends up here over the next couple hours. Matthew (with Maybelline the terrier/dachshund) is in the outfitters trying on new packs. Yesterday his Walmart backpack spontaneously exploded on him and he dragged his belongings to the next road crossings to get a ride here. 
I register for the hostel and nab the last bunk. The bunk room is in the basement with a sign over the door reading ""Detention Center"". It smells like a high school locker room. Well, that might be unfair to locker rooms! But there is a working shower so at least I can be clean. Also here are Philip from Nashville, Dan (possibly to become G.I. Dan after his love for G.I. Joe toys), Liz, Lelu and her dog Stitch from Vermont, Float (3-time thruhiker), Nate, Flash Hand (a deaf hiker also on trailjournals), Marileia (a French lawyer), a couple more Tennessee boys, and more.
Of course a pizza is quickly consumed after my shower, and I pick up fuel and enough food to get me the next 40 miles to Hiawassee. Not only the hostel but the nearby Blood Mtn Cabins are soon sold out. So Mike and Jason from last night hitch to Blairsville when they arrive late. Many more move on to tent nearby.
Having arrived at 2 after a 13 mile day I feel like I should be moving on. But I have to stop at Hiawassee for resupply in two days anyway so it's either cool my heels here or cool them later. So I while the time journaling and chatting with all the hikers. I leave a message at home since I finally have consistent cell signal. Fortunately they call back shortly and I get to hear all their voices. I was thinking about Sara and kids on today's hike, as I do every day. It's not easy being apart, but I know I will see them all soon.
Suddenly two ladies pull up and invite us all over for hot dogs, soda, and beer. Trail magic! Thank you Kathy and Maryhelen from Tampa! Kathy has hiked a bit of the trail, and before we're done we get Maryhelen to hike through the Walasi-Yi arch which is part of the trail. So she too is now an AT alumna! 
A cold beer makes everybody happy after a tough day coming over Blood Mountain. We have an impromptu gathering at picnic tables under the famous boot tree, where people quitting the trail traditionally hurl their boots. No boots are hurled today though!
Aaand...just as I thought the day was over and about to post the journal, Wok Man rolls in to serve up a second round of trail magic!  Fried chicken, fruit, chips, and more beer. Wok Man hiked in 2016 with, you guessed it, a wok to make small fires in, among some other, er, appliances. He's a character and kept us all laughing well after dark. It's a great group at the hostel tonight. Flash Hand cracks us up as well offering beer to the dog. But the party must end because we're all dead tired and have an early wake up call and plenty of miles to cover tomorrow.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593078,"My nine-year-old son is joining me for a section in northern Shenandoah National Park. 
We drove four hours to Front Royal. Left the car at Terrapin Station Hostel in Chester Gap and owner Mike Evans shuttled us to Thornton Gap. He thruhiked in '95 and was a ranger in SNP for several years then a ridgerunner for ATC. 
My son was energetic and enthusiastic for most of the hike today. Dropped our backcountry permit at the Skyline Dr. entrance station. We stopped at Pass Mtn Hut for a break and met John, hiking from Waynesboro to Harpers Ferry. My son found a lucky penny from his birth year. Went over Pass Mountain down to Beahmes Gap. The overlook was fogged in. Trails were muddy and sometimes flooded. We hiked another half mile to a stealth site (technically an undesignated but previously used site) and tented. Made potatoes and noodles with salmon, and chocolate for dessert. Showed him how to hang the food bag, but my tiny carabiner bent under the weight of the bag and friction of the bark. Hoping it doesn't fall during the night. We used up almost all our water but fortunately we were close to a spring and filled up. 
Very quiet here, overlooking the green wooded hillside stretching down towards the valley.","Thornton Gap

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593081,"Woke up around midnight after a rain shower to a branch cracking and falling. I wonder if that's the food bag hitting the ground? Probably shouldn't leave it for the bears! So I go down to check it and thankfully it's still hanging by its poor little bent carabiner.
My son and I roll over a couple times after dawn. We try rehydrated eggs for breakfast which he is not impressed with. Hikers from the last hut are passing as we pack up. 
The morning hike goes well. Terrain is easy and weather still cool. My son (no trail name yet!) is motivated to reach the food stand at Elkwallow Wayside for lunch. We see a doe standing in the trail ten yards away early on. She stares at us, then slowly moves up the trail and ambles off. We celebrate the five plus miles with sandwiches and ice cream then a nap in the shade. A number of other hikers are there as well.
The afternoon is tougher. The temperature rises over 80, the sun beats through the thin canopy. We take a lot of breaks and drain a lot of water. I never knew my son could drink that much. I'm conserving my water for him as the water sources are far apart. But I'm glad he's staying hydrated. As typical the last mile to the shelter seems by far the longest. But it's a welcome sight. There's a bubbling spring, plenty of room, and good company of older section and thru hikers. My son takes offers of Snickers, crackers, and brownies throughout dinner and enjoys a book relaxing in the shelter.","Stealth site near Byrd's Nest #4
",Gravel Springs Hut,"May 20, Sun",10.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593082,"We're up early at Gravel Springs Hut for an oatmeal breakfast. My son slept like a log, but I slept like a rotisserie chicken trying to find a position I could breathe through my hay fever. Not to mention a couple of inconsiderate thruhikers crashed the shelter an hour after dark and proceeded to chat over a long dinner at the picnic table directly in front. You'd think after 900 miles they'd  know shelter etiquette - lay down and be quiet after dark. So if you're reading this, don't be that guy! 
But it's a new day and looks to be beautiful. Our goal is to exit the north end of Shenandoah at Compton Gap Trail where our car is parked, about ten miles away. That's two back-to-back 10 mile days for my nine-year-old boy, but he's eager to get going so tonight we can have a restaurant dinner and tomorrow we can visit Luray Caverns instead of hiking out. 
The morning starts with two climbs over South and North Marshall mountains, both with views. We continue to cross Skyline Drive every mile or two. We hike through Hogwallow Flat and my son is amused by the name (along with Hogback and Pignut mountains). It's then all downhill, as they say, to Jenkins Gap, which is good as the temperature and humidity are rising and wearing us down. 
At Jenkins Gap the overlook is too far up the road so we grab some curb in the trailhead parking lot for lunch. Nearby are three older women who turn out to be the same group who passed us yesterday and shared our picnic table at the Elkwallow Wayside. Dawn, Sharon, and Karen are from Georgia and have been dayhiking the whole length of the AT in Shenandoah for ten days, using Skyland and now Front Royal as bases. They are fretting over lunch about being a few miles short but needing to leave for home tomorrow morning. Their car is here at Jenkins Gap and the ride that dropped them further south is long gone so this is their endpoint for the day. Their friend had planned the hike but suffered an injury and couldn't accompany them, so they have no map and no idea how to finish it. My son and I go back to eating and think it through. Then we have an inspiration and offer that if they want to finish the trail to our car we will shuttle them back here after. They are delighted and gratefully accept, so for the afternoon we have some more hiking partners. 
Our last climb is over Compton mountain and it goes smoothly. But as we cross Skyline Drive for the last time at Compton Gap my son is losing steam. I carry his pack for awhile as we follow the AT through a quiet forest on a wide gravel and dirt horse trail. The ladies try to cheer him on. The trail starts to head downhill and we turn off at the last concrete post for Chester Gap on the Compton Gap Trail. My son struggles for the last half mile but once the trailhead is in sight puts on his pack and jogs down to finish in style. 
The ladies and we cram into the car and head down to Front Royal and up Skyline Drive. The ranger accepts my son's Fourth Grader Pass to enter and gives him a laminated card to sign. We wind up Skyline to Jenkins Gap and drop off our guests. Since it's just 3:30 we take the opportunity to visit Dickey Ridge visitor center and see the wildlife museum and park documentary. We take in all the overlooks on the way back down to Front Royal. 
In town we have dinner at Mom's Country Diner before heading down to Luray for the night (be sure to try Uncle Buck's for breakfast there).
I'm really proud of my son for finding his strength and perseverance and completing 24 miles of the AT in little more than 48 hours, a challenge even for many older hikers. It's not called for frequently in day-to-day life, but he has the endurance and will to succeed at whatever he chooses to pursue.","Gravel Springs Hut

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593083,"Up at dawn to drive to Harpers Ferry for a solo two night section. On the radio I hear reports of flooding from yesterday's downpour. The Patuxent River collapsed a road, bridges impassable, looks like an exciting day to hike!
The gate ranger at Harper's Ferry National Park, where I'm dropping the car, tells me there's no entry fee today. They expect flooding in the Lower Town this afternoon as the Potomac and Shenandoah crest and are closing all the exhibits to move them to the second floors. Guess it was quite a lot of rain.
Sharon, a Front Royal retiree, shuttles me from Harpers Ferry to Chester Gap to resume where my son and I left off at the northern boundary of Shenandoah National Park. She moved between military bases constantly as a mother and army wife, but in retirement settled in the Blue Ridge and began shuttling at her hiker husband's suggestion. They even boarded hikers for a few years. Mostly we talk about dogs, especially border collies.
I reach the AT from the Compton Gap Trail around 10:30. The forest has greened up even more over the last two weeks. It's turning into a gorgeous mild day, perfect for hiking. The trail is groomed until it exits the park, then follows rocky switchbacks down past Tom Floyd shelter and through muddy trail to route 522. The creeks are raging and the stepping stones are underwater so I just wade through. Between creek crossings, trail runoff, and mudpits my feet will not dry all day. 
At the Jim and Molly Denton shelter there's a large lunch crowd. About a dozen thruhikers, including a French Canadian couple, are lounging on a deck built out from the shelter. I grab a bite of tuna at the picnic table under a separate pavilion with a young couple doing their first backpacking trip - three weeks or so - and a woman from Albany doing a long section. There's even a solar shower here for those inclined.
I head off, uncertain of how far I will go and trying to tamp down my instinct to go for mileage. I'll be in Harper's Ferry Wednesday morning or midday regardless of my choice so I just relax and see where I am as evening approaches. There are no views to interrupt my thoughts and few road crossings, but lots of mud, cascading water. I just plow through it, dirtying my shoes in the mud and cleaning them in the  runoff. Oh, and there are rocks. Rocks suspiciously like those in Pennsylvania.
Thruhikers like to complain about Rocksylvania, but the truth is the rocks start in northern Shenandoah, continue through northern Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland, ebb in southern PA, then come back in northern PA and to a lesser extent in New Jersey before resurging in New York. They are a feature of the middle Appalachians, but Rockvirginia and Maryrocks aren't catchy names.
As evening approaches I aim for a side trail past Sky Meadows State Park to an overlook to stealth camp. I'm not in the mood to join a crowd at the shelter, which in any case is too far to reach before dark.  The side trail leads over a fantastic grassy hill to a view of the Virginia foothills to the east spread out over a wide valley. There's even a little picnic table to make dinner - rice and spicy salmon. The spice counteracts the blandness of the Knoll rice mix and makes an adequate meal. I'm not hungry enough to think it's any better than adequate!
I pitch the tent without the rainfly -may be the first time I've done this, there always seems to be a chance of rain - and journal as the sky darkens and lights begin to twinkle in the valley down below. Maybe I'll catch some stars tonight. And maybe these night breezes will dry my socks just a little.","Compton Gap Trail
",Stealth site at Sky Meadows Ambassador Whitehouse Trail,"Jun 04, Mon",22.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593209,"Today is one year since I started hiking the AT. Started north out of Harpers Ferry. I'll be there coincidentally tomorrow, but still have a little over 900 miles for future sections.
I wake up before 5 at my stealth site with a view to see the half moon in a clear sky and predawn colors backlighting the horizon. I break camp as the sun rises over a hill. The overnight breezes did dry my socks, so it's already a great day! 
After eating some oatmeal and drying the dew off my tent in the morning sun I head out. Sky Meadows is a beautiful park with many hiking trails. But the AT leaves the park and heads into the forest, rocks, and mud again. The water has subsided somewhat but the streams are still flooded and tricky to cross and mudpits still cover some stretches. I manage to avoid totally soaking my feet though, a great improvement.
At Ashby Gap someone's left trail magic in the form of cold beer and Gatorade. So for second breakfast I have a Bavarian-style Weiss and it tastes great. It's a grain, it counts as a breakfast, right?
The next 13 miles are known as the Roller Coaster, about a dozen ups and downs one after the other. Most are 400-500 feet at a grade with rocks that would have driven hikers off the trail in Georgia. But thruhikers take them in stride at this point. I think of the Carters and Wildcats in New Hampshire - a dozen or so mountains much steeper than this in a day-long section.
Halfway through I pass the 1000 mile mark. Doesn't mean much to me, but I add it to my photo collection for kicks. I point it out to a thruhiker coming up behind. He looks, says ""Huh, guess we're almost halfway there"", then moves on. 
Three-quarters through the roller coaster I stop at Bear's Den hostel just off trail hoping to score a snack. The store is closed and caretaker away but the bunk room is open and I find a fridge to buy a soda, making the short detour well worth it. A hiker sitting outside sees me leave with the soda and makes a beeline for the fridge. There's a work crew of graduating seniors from the local high school splitting firewood for the campsite.
Still jonesing for a snack I head down to Snickers Gap where there's a restaurant a mile off trail. I'm not eager for the off-trail miles but food is food.  I hit the trailhead and start looking for the turn towards town, then notice the trail angels standing in the parking lot. They've brought cookies, chips, McDonalds burgers, Gatorade, beer, and cupcakes with ""1000"" written in icing. Looks like I found my snack! The angels are parents of two thruhikers a few miles behind us. One of the parents, Mary, had left this morning's beer as well, so extra thanks to her! Also thanks to Steve and Cherie from Ohio. Mary flew in cross country from Seattle when her daughter sent her picture of the trenchfoot she got from all the rain.
I hike the rest of the roller coaster and a further 4 miles with Hero from Alabama. He's a mate on an Atlantic coastal freight tugboat and has been hiking 3 weeks on, 3 off to fit his work schedule. Along the way he shoos a large black snake off the trail who coils and hisses at us.
We stop at the Blackburn Trail Center run by the Potomac trail club to stay in their cabin for the night. There's a huge screened porch on the main building with a view west. Several thruhikers are tenting or in the cabin, along with a group of high school kids from Salisbury, Maryland on a year-end hiking trip. Tangerine is the first in the cabin. She tried to thruhike last year but shin splints drove her off after 600 miles. She has a minor case of them now and is taking it easy for awhile. Early the next morning we find out her better name would be Earthquake after hearing her get up at 5 and pack her things.

But I'm well rested, despite tossing and turning with hay fever. It's a bit nippy for June. Hero, who sent his sleeping bag home last week, had another restless night. He's planning to tackle the Four State Challenge tomorrow (hike from the Virginia border across West Virginia and Maryland to Pennsylvania in 24 hours) and get to Waynesboro PA where he can find an inexpensive replacement. I attempted the Challenge last year (on my first day) and came up a few miles short, so I give him some tips for success. Sage advice like don't waste an hour in Harpers Ferry looking for an open cafe to grab breakfast, and don't try it when it's raining! And maybe, just maybe, don't attempt to hike 45 miles on your first day! 
After a quiet oatmeal breakfast on the cabin porch Hero and I hike out about 6:30. It's a beautiful morning, low humidity, mostly clear, around 60 degrees. Perfect hiking weather. The twelve miles to Harpers Ferry go quickly over a relatively level if rocky ridge as we chat away. The steepest climb by far is that from the Blackburn Center back to the AT. We pass our earlybird cabin mate in the late morning but see no other northbounders. Nearing West Virginia we meet a man just starting his trek to Georgia. He confirms the bridge heading north out of Harpers Ferry has reopened, a major concern for those continuing into Maryland.
We pass into West Virginia at the spot I started my hike last year. It's familiar, I can easily find where I stealth camped and remember the turns and rocks I followed out. But it's just one more stretch of rocky ridge, nothing special. Last year it was a whole new world. I can remember waking at 3am, giddy and anxious, and not daring to hit the rocky trail til predawn light. 
Harpers Ferry is bustling with traffic and hikers. We follow the AT across the 340 bridge over the raging mud-brown Shenandoah River to the side trail for the ATC. It takes us through the grounds of former Storer College, the first college in the south to admit blacks, and now a National Park Service training center. Later we see a crew of trainees peering attentively at a plaque on Washington St as a ranger points out its significance.
A dozen packs are lined up outside the ATC office. A staffer takes our pictures in front of the building and enshrines us in the photo album. Hero is northbound thruhiker 599 for the year, I am section hiker 183. This is peak season. Over a hundred have come through in the last few days alone. Hero started on March 29 as number 1600 or so. Another who started weeks earlier was in the 700s. I was 2277 on April 16. With a 50% retention rate through Harpers Ferry, doubtless hundreds more hikers will be adding their pictures to the bulging album in the next few weeks.
A woman in her fifties is devouring a huge burger in the hiker lounge. She's headed south. ""Everyone assumes I'm a section hiker"" she tells me. But she's not. She and her daughter started at Katahdin last August. Her daughter had to quit, but she slowly continued solo down to New York by December. Then winter cold and high motel costs pushed her off trail til spring. Northbounders are used to seeing southbound stragglers in Georgia in February and March. But in Harpers Ferry in June? It's no surprise to learn she is one of the first southbound thruhikers to pass through here so far this year. Her photo gets a blue 4.
Outside hikers are shooting the breeze. A FedEx driver walks up to warn us the local post office will no longer hold ""general delivery"" packages. This is how most hikers receive mail drops since their arrival date is uncertain, so there is shock and some grumbling from those expecting a package. I wasn't aware local post offices could change that policy. It always pays to call ahead.
Hero and I grab a bite at a pizza joint down the street. Our green and very attentive waitress comes over to check on us a dozen times in a half hour. Hero orders a ""small"" calzone, which turns out to be appropriately sized for a thruhiker and could feed 3 or 4 people with normal appetites. Even though he's loading up on calories for tomorrow, it's so large he invites me to help him finish it. I do, but regret it an hour later!
We walk down to my car in the park service's lot. I drive Hero back across the river to the closest trailhead to the Virginia/West Virginia border where he will stealth camp and start hiking shortly after midnight. If all goes well he'll be in Pennsylvania for dinner tomorrow.
My three-hour drive home is uneventful. After two other recent trips out this way for hikes with my boys it's starting to feel like a commute! Fortunately it's to the best job I can imagine. Once home I'm delighted to see Sara and the kids and hear about strawberry picking and share some big hugs.
After a day at home I'll be heading back to Shenandoah, this time with my daughter, who hiked across Maryland with me last year before I started my flip-flop. She's a strong hiker and a great companion. I'm looking forward to finishing the park with her!","Blackburn Trail Center

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593662,"My daughter and I are hiking the AT south through Shenandoah from Thornton Gap to Rockfish Gap over the next six days. We drive 4.5 hours from Chester County PA to Waynesboro VA, driving past the Shenandoah ridgeline for the last hour. After lunch at the Tailgate Diner, deservedly known for the best burgers in the Shenandoah Valley, we park our car at Stanimal's hostel in town.
Kathleen ""No Worries"" shuttles us to Thornton Gap where my son and I had started north last month. No Worries attempted a thruhike this year but was knocked off by a scooter accident on a side trip to Washington. In her off-trail life she's a hiking and kayaking guide for groups like the Waldorf schools. 
We register our backcountry permit at the entrance station then climb 1200 feet to Mary's Rock, a spectacular full circle view. This will be the longest and highest climb of our section and we feel lucky to get it out of the way first. We meet 2016 thruhiker Mr. Fusion at the summit who is also hiking Shenandoah southbound.
The trail is generally rocky but the biggest climb after Mary's Rock is only 400 feet. It is also surprisingly dry given all the rain last week. We pass the Pinnacle viewpoint. There's a crash in the bushes on the uphill side and we see a bear cub trying to make himself invisible about 20 yards away. He's quickly out of sight and we make plenty of noise to let Mama Bear know we are moving on.
At the Pinnacle picnic grounds we have dinner. Here we have access to our second fully-plumbed restroom since hitting the trail just hours ago! The services are so dense in this section of Shenandoah you barely need to carry food, water, or toilet paper.
It's already 7:30 as we head south looking for a stealth tentsite. There are no obviously used areas in the first mile or more. I ask a passing northbounder and he remembers one two miles away at the top of Stony Man mountain. Too far for us tonight! But we are in a small gap and on close inspection find a very small, reasonably level and relatively rock-free site that may have been used before about 50 feet off trail surrounded by fallen trees. The deadfall gives me pause, but nothing still standing looks like a threat and no severe weather is forecast.
After my usual frustration hanging the bear bag we settle in for a quiet night. Skyline Drive is only a hundred yards away, but there is no one else around in our own private wilderness.","Thornton Gap

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593664,"It's a comfortable morning, but we sleep in til nearly 7, exhausted after a long day of driving, climbing, and hiking. Breakfast is a yogurt squeezer and poptarts. I'm not hungry but my daughter has her appetite. We pack up and leave our stealth site. We were lucky to find it, and we are soon to learn that they are few and far between in this central part of the park.
For the first couple hours we climb up Stony Man, the second highest summit in the park at 4011 feet. On the way up from Little Stony Man Cliffs we suddenly see a bear in a tree about forty yards downhill from the trail. He slept in later than us! He's grown but not large. He's heard us and climbs down (what's called ""treeing"" a bear). We're a bit nervous as he's coming down but keep moving slowly and making noise. I manage to get a picture. He has no interest in us, though. He hangs out at the bottom of the tree tending to his business and ignoring us as we hike on. 
At the summit of Stony Man the view is spectacular. Layer upon layer of blue-hued mountains recedes to the hazy horizon to the north, south, and west. We can identify the entire northern third of the park, Hawksbill to the south, and more beyond. 
After a brief mistaken detour on a horse trail on the way down, we follow the AT to Skyland resort. Their restaurant is still serving breakfast and we are both hungry now. The waitress asks if we want to order off the menu or get the buffet. ""Buffet please!"" we say without thinking twice. There's pancakes, bacon, sausage, grits, eggs, potatoes, biscuits and gravy, and an omelet station. We're not the only hikers it has attracted. We leave well satisfied, if a little slow and groggy.
Most of the day we follow the trail along the side of steep hills plummeting away from Skyline Drive. We are spared traffic noise and the trail is well-built and level with rock retention walls most of the way.  It is mostly rocky, but the elevation changes are minimal. However the rising temperature and humidity take a toll and wear us down. We skip the one and a half mile round trip to the summit of Hawksbill, the park's highest peak, with it's 500 foot climb, to conserve our energy.
We pass numerous northbound thruhikers, section hikers, and dayhikers. It's a busy June Saturday with good weather. But it never feels crowded. Just close to civilization.
We make it to Big Meadows campground and lodge around 4 and hike around to the far side to reach the Wayside. Burgers, soda, and a blackberry milkshake, a park specialty, perk us up. I find AT passport stamps at the visitor center, and my daughter finds an AT/Shenandoah key ring to hang from her pack in the gift shop. 
We resolve to put a couple more miles behind us to keep tomorrow's mileage down. Thunderstorms are expected starting mid-afternoon into Monday. We pass the sprawling grassy meadows that give Big Meadows its name and follow the trail for an easy two miles towards Hazeltop mountain. Halfway to Milam Gap we see a buck grazing on shrubs in the middle of the trail. We watch for a couple of minutes. There's a doe off in the brush as well. The buck sees us but doesn't seem inclined to move. Finally we need to press on, and have to shoo him off the trail so we can pass.  He reluctantly steps back, more like a stubborn cow than a skittish deer. We hike on through Milam Gap and start looking for a tentsite. We quickly find a flat, smooth stealth spot 30 yards off trail on a rare wide, flat ridge. 
After setting up and relaxing for awhile with the flaps open, we hear someone walking around outside. Must be another hiker looking to tent. But no, it's a doe! She looks curiously at our tent then slowly moves on.
We are once again surrounded only by the sounds of birds and the occasional coyote as we drift off to sleep.","Hughes River Gap stealth site

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593666,"We expected thunderstorms overnight but they passed us by and we wake to a dry tent and a cool morning. I cook oatmeal on a handy boulder by the tentsite. It's quiet and peaceful even though we are not far from Skyline Drive. 
My daughter and I hike out a little before 8. The trail is much nicer than yesterday, mostly dirt track passing through verdant understory and few rocky areas or steep side hills. The inclines are relatively mild except for some short steep climbs up Bearfence Mountain. No great viewpoints today, but it is pleasant just walking through the woods. 
We stop at Lewis Campground and visit the store for cold drinks where the ranger regales us with hiker stories. We make an early lunch of peanut butter bagels on the picnic table outside, beating back a hoard of gnats with a campground flyer. As we exit, a thruhiker runs full tilt by us northbound up the trail on the smooth tread. He has a minimalist pack, and I assume he is trying to set some kind of record. But other thruhikers he's passed don't know his story.
A few hours later we stop at South River Picnic Area after a viewless climb over Baldface Mountain and have a second lunch of tuna. We pack up as dark clouds move in and the wind begins to whip up. 
We hike quickly towards Swift Run Gap where we've arranged to be picked up to stay at the Country View Motel just a couple miles out of the park on the road to Elkton. The thunder in the distant west suddenly jumps over to the east and we walk right into the center of a downpour! Our ponchos protect us fairly well and we make great time getting to the entrance station, but we are dripping wet and the rain is still coming down in buckets. The ranger lets us splay out in front of their office under the large roof while we wait. 
An old minivan pulls up and a guy pops his head out to see if we are his pickup. We pile into the unkempt vehicle with beat-up seats and debris scattered around. The man turns out to be the motel maintenance guy who shuttles on the side. A woman is up front and a baby, his nephew, is in a car seat in the third row. The baby looks a little unsure of us, but soon warms up when I make silly faces and growl like a bear. He starts to cry when it's time for us to get out at the motel. 
We get our room, a simple affair that has the key things that matter to hikers: a shower, a toilet, a soft bed, and a delivery menu. We are soon clean, well fed, and watching the Princess Bride. Meanwhile the rain has subsided. Thunderstorms are forecast overnight into the early morning, followed by showers all day. We plan out a hike between hard shelters and designate a couple of fall back points if we can't make it all the way to Loft Mountain Campground tomorrow.
There are other hikers sheltering here for the night, and I trade info with a thruhiker and northbound section hiker. We have a big climb out of the gap to start our morning. Time to get some shut-eye!","Stealth site south of Milam Gap

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593742,"Our shoes and equipment are nearly dry in the morning from their soaking in yesterday afternoon's thunderstorm thanks to the motel A/C overnight. A blast from the hair dryer finishes the job. It's damp and chilly outside but last night's thunderstorms don't seem to have materialized. The forecast, however, calls for light showers on and off throughout the day, and we will spend much of it climbing. I am accustomed and resigned to getting wet and staying damp for the remainder of Shenandoah, but this will be no fun at all for my daughter, a literal slog through the woods. We had intended to head out first thing, but the motel desk doesn't open until 9 and they are our link to the shuttle. That delay gives me time to examine the forecast in more detail, and a good thing! 
The timing is uncertain at first, with rain expected in the late morning and a big gap til late afternoon, so we plan a late start and an early stop at Pinefield Hut, 11 miles out. But the radar soon reveals that the huge front that dumped inches of rain on Ohio and Pennsylvania yesterday has shifted south and we are directly in the path of large swathes of potentially heavy rain that will be continuous until evening. So to rescue the remainder of our trip we decide to call it a zero day. We'll rest up, stay dry, and hit the trail fresh in the morning.
Thruhikers have a saying ""No rain, no pain, no Maine"", and that was never truer than this year when there's been so much rain a hiker trying to avoid it would probably take twelve months to reach Katahdin. But section hikers have an advantage here since Katahdin never closes for us! Maybe one day we'll be ready to steel ourselves and head unnecessarily into a day of guaranteed misery, but that is not today!Since we have a hard stop on Wednesday we won't reach Rockfish Gap, but we will have a great time. I will be back for those miles on another trip. We've been covering longer distances than most section hikers we've met. Even some thruhikers would be happy to cover 60 miles in four hiking days. I am extremely proud of how my daughter has acquitted herself on this adventure and we look forward to having more fun these last few days.
End of day update: it did indeed rain constantly and often heavily until about 5 so we are quite happy sacrificing a few miles today. We got to do laundry, sample motel pizza (verdict: meh) and gas station fried chicken from Bear Country Store down the road (yummy), and catch up on reading, journaling and Disney channel sitcoms. Good day!","Country View Motel
",Country View Motel,"Jun 11, Mon",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594054,"We wake in the Country View Motel to a great day for hiking, cool weather and mostly cloudy. The fog is rolling through at 3000 feet most of the day and we often walk up and down through it.
We're shuttled to Swift Run Gap by the friendly motel clerk along with two thruhikers who came in yesterday afternoon to escape the rain. They and other thruhikers tell us it was a particular difficult storm, that it rarely rains all day like that.
A ranger stops us as we walk through the Swift Run Gap entrance station back to the trail and asks to see our passes. We point to our backcountry permits, but she insists we each need an individual park entry permit since we are walking in without a car. That'll be $15 a head please! We argue, especially for the thruhikers, that the AT access points at north and south don't require an entry permit and we are just returning, not entering fresh here. A more senior ranger out of uniform interjects and explains the entry fee is separate from the backcountry permit and it's required of everybody, but quickly decides it's not worth insisting and tells the other to let us through. But how ridiculous! A car full of tourists can get in for $25, get anywhere in the park in a few hours, leave trash lying around, heavily use the visitor centers and other expensive frontcountry services and consume nearly all the rangers' attention, but long distance hikers following Leave No Trace, unable to reach more than one developed area a day, and staying mostly in the backcountry bothering nobody are supposed to pay $15 each? Nevermind the AT was here before the national park existed, and was moved to allow Skyline Drive to bring all the tourists in. I'd write it off to a green ranger except that the more experienced one was ready to back her up. Fortunately the two times I started at Thornton Gap the rangers were extremely nice, even giving me a map and taking our trash, never saying a word about an entry fee. There ends my rant.
After that unpleasantness we climb the 1300 feet to Hightop Mountain. We're fresh, rested, and well-fed so it goes surprisingly quickly. The trail is very well groomed in this area. The rest of the day consists of a half-dozen mostly 600-700 foot climbs, some fairly steep, followed by descents to gaps - Smith Roach, Powell, Simmons, Pinefield, Ivy Creek and more. Few summits have views. It feels like the Roller Coaster in northern Virginia only all the climbs are longer, higher, and/or steeper. We fuel up with multiple lunches and Snickers breaks. There's also a tricky crossing over Ivy Creek. Surprisingly the trail is not very muddy and there is almost no standing water or runoff from yesterday's storm. So the miles pass quickly despite the elevation changes. 
But around mile 14, climbing another 700 foot ascent to the Loft Mountain Wayside side trails, we hit a wall and it's time to bring out our secret weapon - the can of Coke I've carried all these miles from the motel. It gets us through to Loft Mountain Campground. 
In the afternoon we run into Philip, a thruhiker I last saw at Neel Gap's hostel in April headed north (naturally). That's surprising enough, but only minutes later I run into Chili, a section hiker I hiked with last year from the Hudson to Vermont. He's thruhiking now. Quite a coincidence to run into him on the trip I happened to do southbound.
In the late afternoon and evening we have close encounters with at least a half dozen deer. They are not shy about standing in or next to the trail while browsing their dinner. I literally have to shoo a couple of them off the trail, getting within a few feet of them and wondering if they kick like a mule.
My daughter got her trail name today: Snickers, after her favorite trail food!  In fact, I named one of the unnamed mountains we climbed in today's roller coaster Mt Snickers in her honor.
At Loft Mountain we stop in the camp store to get some snacks then grab a tent site in the primitive walk-in camping area. It's a luxury having a flat site, a picnic table, and bear box. Not to mention bathrooms, water, and trash bins nearby. While Snickers rests I go and hike the 1.3 miles of the AT that loops around the campground so we can exit on the south side in the morning and save some time.
The fog has rolled in and the whole campground is shrouded in mist as we eat noodles for dinner and get ready for bed.","Swift Run Gap (Elkton)

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594135,"We wake up to cool temperatures and a rainfly wet from fog dripping off the trees at our Loft Mountain stealth campsite. Stealth because we came in after hours and are leaving very early.
After eating the last of our oatmeal and poptarts we head out into the still foggy morning. The trail continues to be easy walking with few rocks and roots and little mud. This southern half of the park must be what people think of when they picture hiking in Shenandoah. There are minimal climbs today on the seven mile stretch to our exit point at Black Rock Gap. 
The deer are still bold in this stretch. Once shooed off trail they stay close, picking at the shrubs and eyeing us curiously. We pass a dozen or so hikers in the space of an hour coming from the Black Rock Hut so our morning is full of greetings and pleasantries. The fog lifts and blue sky and sun appear at last.
We stop at Black Rock summit to take in the near full circle views from the top of the jumble of sharp-edged boulders crowning it. Here we can see north along the length of the Shenandoah park, including the 60 miles and countless mountains we crossed over the last few days, as well as glimpses of rural parts of Shenandoah Valley to the west and the Virginia plains to the east, and more Shenandoah mountains to the south. 
We end the hike with a long steep descent to the gap, wait as a parsfe of a dozen motorcycles pass on Skyline Drive, then encounter husband and wife thruhikers from Minnesota resting in the parking lot. We lay out the tent to dry in the sun, finish our snacks, and wait for Stanimal's shuttle to arrive.
No Worries, the same driver who dropped us at Thornton Gap, pulls in and drops off a slackpacker. We pile in to the BMW (very stylish for a shuttle!) and take off south down Skyline Drive. Around the bend a bear cub is standing just off the road. We stop and snap some pictures. There's a cyclist with the same idea, but he doesn't have the mobility to escape if Mama Bear suddenly appears and we try to warn him off. He's too interested in getting a close-up.
We retrieve our car from Stanimal's old hostel location and make a beeline for the Tailgate Grill for another best-of-the-Valley burger. It tastes even better than before the hike. No surprise there! With that celebration our section is officially a  success and our long but fortunately uneventful drive back to Philly commences.","Loft Mountain Campground
",Black Rock Gap,"Jun 13, Wed",6.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594728,"I'm headed to Virginia to hike the section from Daleville north to Black Rock Gap in Shenandoah where I left off with my daughter Snickers. It's a four and a half hour drive and I'm out before 4am to make the most of the day.
No Worries (Kathleen from Wisconsin) is my ride again and I once again leave my car in Waynesboro at Stanimal's. It's over an hour drive to Daleville where I'm unceremoniously dropped off on the shoulder of a busy road where the AT crosses. I almost forgot to pay, and then as I'm putting my money away I can't find my cards and ID! The shuttle pulled away, did I leave them in the car? A few frantic minutes later I find them laying on the ground. Okay, that was a little too close a call. Have to hang on to those tighter.
There's a convenience store by the trailhead but I decide against carrying a cold drink. I will later regret this! The trail meanders through the valley to Troutville where one of those ultra-long freight trains is passing over the trail. I read the trailhead signs while I wait. I'm in Botecourt county, which once extended as far as the Mississippi River and covered what are now seven states! That's back when Virginia claimed most of the land west of the Appalachians to the Pacific.
The trail winds over a lovely grassy hill with a bucolic view, then begins ascending to the ridge in Jefferson National Forest through wide sweeping switchbacks. The treadway is ideal. Soon I'm 1300 feet higher and traversing the ridgeline.
The trail starts to parallel the Blue Ridge Parkway. It goes directly through four overlooks on the road, and several clearings where trees have been felled to give drivers a view. Traffic is light. About half the passing vehicles are motorcycles out for a joy ride.
There are no tough climbs today but it is hot and humid. It seems hotter than the 85 my thermometer reads. I am dripping  with sweat all day. I keep my shirt off, but that leads to chafing from the backpack. 
My big mistake is underestimating my water needs. I am not drinking enough, and by the time I realize this all the decent water sources are behind me. Trail magic in the form of ice cold water bottles at one of the overlooks saves my butt temporarily. Later I stop at Bobblet's Gap shelter to refill. It's the only source for miles in either direction. It's off trail down numerous switchbacks. Ugh! I'll have to climb back up. There I meet thruhiker Booger Bear, just back from canoeing on the Shenandoah River. He introduces me to the poor water source. It's nearly dry. A small pool with a concrete dam produces a slow trickle facilitated by several leaves to direct it into a drip. It takes 5-10 minutes to fill each liter.
Once filled I have a second late lunch to boost my energy. I'm likely low on salt and electrolytes too, but I have no tablets or powder. I am not used to summer hiking. I remember having the same problem with heat and humidity in New York last year. 
I've been aiming for a campsite with a water supply and swimming hole (!) at Jennings Creek by VA614. That would position me to reach Glasgow tomorrow. But by evening I am out of energy and the feet and legs are tired. I know it is partly dehydration, but there is zero water on this stretch. I stop at the Cove Mountain shelter for the night. It has no water. Booger Bear catches up and tents. I opt for the shelter to make for a quicker exit in the morning - for water and to make it to Glasgow.  But the mosquitoes and ants decide to join me in the shelter. Oh well, tomorrow's a new day!
Safe, too warm, and too dry (my mouth, not my clothes!) on the Appalachian Trail.","Daleville
",Cove Mountain Shelter,"Jun 18, Mon",25
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594729,"I'm up at quarter of six. I expected the sun to wake me earlier, but it rises later here than further north/east. No worries, I pack fast and take off. I have almost no water and three miles, fortunately downhill, to the next source. 
At Jennings Creek I camel up by downing a liter of water and refilling two liters, and fill up with oatmeal. I have a very ambitious day of 32 miles to get to the James River and shuttle into Glasgow for resupply and a night in the hostel. But I should have looked more closely at the elevation chart when planning this in my armchair at home. It looks like a mountain range a child would draw, a series of sharp, steep pointy tops gradually going higher and higher than lower and lower. Yikes!
Fortunately most of the big climbs are in the morning. But each one tests my energy reserves. I try to stay hydrated but I can't drink enough. And the water sources continue to be low and time-consuming. I don't need to urinate all day despite downing a couple gallons of water. The humidity soaks it right out of my skin almost as soon as I drink it. It's harder to eat dry snacks because my mouth is dry, but I need to keep my energy up. 
The climbs are all steep, and several are more than 1000 feet. By the time I reach today's midpoint as well as the highest peak, Apple Orchard mountain at elevation 4225, I've climbed 4000 feet. The downhills to the gaps between each climb are depressing because I know I need to regain that altitude. And the downhills are bone-jarringly steep. My calf muscles are involuntarily twitching by the end of the day. The tread is much rockier than yesterday, making for a mental challenge on the downhills. One advantage is that there are a few views of hazy blue mountains. This region is surrounded by beautiful mountain chains and rural valleys. But I have no energy to step too far off the trail so I walk past some of them.
I take frequent breaks, especially on the uphills. For me this is unusual. I remember climbing 1000-2000 foot bouldery ascents - far steeper than these - in New Hampshire and Maine with nary a breather. I don't know if it's the humidity or I've lost my endurance. Probably both.
So I crawl, by my standard, at 2.3 miles an hour all day. With 32 miles to cover it's six o'clock before I am within six miles of the James and call to arrange pickup by the hostel at the gap. But the hostel is full! I was not expecting this. I thought it was late in the season and getting a bed would be no problem. But I've come too far today to give up on a town visit. I need a shower, laundry, cold drinks, and a big dinner far more than I thought I would this morning. I am soaked with sweat and already smell atrocious. And if I don't resupply here I will have to burn time getting into Buena Vista later. So, after finding out the town of Glasgow allows tenting in their park, along with an outdoor shower, I ask the hostel for a shuttle from the trailhead. It will be eight by the time I get there and I can't count on scoring a ride from a dayhiker so late. 
The evening walk should be a piece of cake as it is quite literally 95% downhill, but it is very very steep for much of it and even the little ups take the wind out of my sails. I continue to suck down water as quickly as I can. The two miles from the last shelter to the footbridge over the river are the longest of the day, even though they are nearly flat. 
The footbridge goes over the gorgeous James River valley. The sun is just setting over the hills and I take ample advantage with the camera as I stroll across.
My no good horrible day all pays off when Robert from Stanimal's picks me up and runs me into town. It's a one-grocery small town with no chains except a Dollar General, and there is only one restaurant. But one is enough! At Scotto's, I stuff my face with cold tea, water, a milkshake, lasagna, garlic bread and, oh yeah, even a salad. An hour later I'm hungry again as I journal in my tent in the park. 
At the restaurant I run into people I saw in Georgia at the beginning of their thruhikes. Medicine Man, who I stayed at Stover Creek shelter with, Juice, who I met at Gooch Mountain shelter, and even Jason (now Chewy) who shared a campsite on Ramrock mountain with me. I thought they'd all be further north by now. At this rate, two months and one third of the trail in, they'll be knocking on Katahdin's door in mid-October when it usually closes.  In the log at the last shelter I saw someone signed it that they were celebrating four months on trail! Now that's taking it easy!
After the last two days of nonstop hiking and dehydration, I am seriously considering a zero day here. The hostel should have a bed tomorrow, and I could use a long rest and ample beverages. That will force an adjustment to my section hike, but I need to learn to stop killing myself with an unrealistic schedule and enjoy more of the time I'm out here.","Cove Mountain Shelter
",Glasgow,"Jun 19, Tue",31.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594966,"I tossed and turned again last night in the humidity. I don't wake til almost seven. There's a hiker shelter in the park I didn't see last night. It's got bunks stacked three high and electrical outlets. It's bustling now with the first wave of hikers looking to leave town. A guy named Matthew Friedberger is hanging out with his black lab. He's here to shuttle hikers to the trail for free whenever, filling in for ""Phil"" who has a sign posted regarding shuttling.
I feel better than yesterday and the morning starts cooler but I'm uncertain how quickly I want to hit the trail so I skip the first shuttle. Instead I head to Dollar General and Grocery Express to resupply. But I buy more ice teas than food. My food bag is still quite full since I've been too tired or in a hurry to have a full lunch or dinner on trail.
After drinking an OJ, two teas, water, and a Busch beer handed me by another local visiting the shelter I begin to feel almost normal. I'm ready to hit the trail but it's like herding cats. Everyone is going about the business of laundry, resupply, showers (there was actually hot water!), breaking camp, drying dew-laden tents, etc. Eventually Matthew drives me and another hiker out at noon. Everyone else is napping, getting lunch, or waiting out the upcoming thunderstorm.
The thunderstorm turns out to be one of the best parts of the day, in a good way. There's a 2300 foot climb out of the James River valley that is fairly steep. I pace myself, putting it in low gear to keep moving steadily. The humidity and heat are building though and I feel it enervating me. As I pause to sit on a boulder at an overlook I snap a picture of the western hills and gray sky. I check AccuWeather to see where the storm is. It thinks I'm in Lynchburg to the east and tells me rain starts in 95 minutes. But on the radar it shows a mass of red and yellow nearly upon my actual position! Sure enough, rain drops start on cue and I quickly don my poncho. Soon it is pouring and thunder is rumbling all around. 
The temperature and humidity drop quickly and cool winds blow. The emergency poncho keeps me and the pack mostly dry, however. It's pleasant walking in the cooler air and I finish the ascent as the storm calms about 20 minutes later. Of course my shoes and socks are soaked, but all else came through unscathed. 
I'm planning only fifteen miles so I take my time and go much slower than yesterday. But on the last big climb I pass two girls who took the earlier shuttle, so I guess I'm still going a good clip. 
Bluff Mountain at elevation 3372 is today's high point. The James River is at 679. Bluff is a narrow peak with the foundation of an old fire tower and a memorial to a four year old boy who wandered out of school and perished here on the mountain. This was way back in 1891. Bluff also has great views to both east and west from the same spot. I dry my poncho out in the sun until the biting gnats drive me back into the forest.
Heading downhill the humidity is building again and the sun has returned. I fantasize about getting a hitch into Buena Vista from the gravel road ahead. It seems unlikely, but having missed an air-conditioned bed last night and missed town breakfast and lunch today I am tempted to try. I decide to let fate determine it. 
I cross the Blue Ridge Parkway at an ""overlook"" that is covered in trees, then reach the gravel road, VA 607. Three-digit roads in Virginia seem to be seldom-used backcountry affairs. Most people stick to the two-digit roads. Sure enough, no cars are parked here. Not a popular dayhiking trailhead. But there is a fantastic flowing spring, first I've seen in days, and I eagerly top off my water. While I'm filtering water, a Forest Service truck passes. He doesn't slow down and I don't wave him down. So fate has dealt my hand. I don't really want town enough to walk the six miles down the road.
Instead I head five miles down trail to Pedlar's River Bridge. The main road to Buena Vista, US 60, is an easy seven miles in the morning so I can pop in for lunch. My guide says there is camping near the bridge, but it's little more than a flat access path to the creek. But there's no shelter or campsite for another five miles and it's already after seven so I pitch my tent near another hiker. The bridge itself is a well-constructed floating suspension footbridge hanging well above flood stage. I think back and there have been no creeks or streams that required fording in Virginia so far (except after major storms). This week, the water has been low everywhere.
I force myself to eat dinner. The hiking and humidity sap my appetite, at least until I'm in town. But I haven't figured out yet how to pack a stromboli or Chinese buffet in my food bag! I did, however, consume snacks all day, including five Slim Jims which have become my go-to energy booster before a big climb. Something about the fat, salt, and juice is satisfying. I try not to think about what's in it. 
Tonight I have the sound of rushing water from the creek 20 yards away and some evening bird calls to lull me to sleep. Hopefully tomorrow is less humid. 
For now, I'm safe, warm, and way too damp on the Appalachian Trail.","Glasgow
",Pedlar's River bridge,"Jun 20, Wed",15
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594972,"A fierce thunderstorm blew in around 11 last night and poured buckets for over an hour. I had to quickly close the flaps on the rainfly which I'd left open for circulation. I find out this morning though that I hadn't closed the flap over my pack properly so it is now nice and wet. So too is the food bag I hung, which for some reason I thought was waterproof. Nope!
I pull on my damp hiking clothes reluctantly, but truth is my sleeping clothes hardly feel any dryer. Goes without saying my socks and shoes are as wet as when I took them off. Plus with runoff pouring under the tent (ground looked flat last night!), the footprint and bottom of the tent are wet along with the fly. So pretty much everything is wet and I'm in no mood to sit on a damp rock and cook oatmeal while the bees divebomb me. I hike out over the Pedlar's River footbridge.
There's a hammock strung underneath the far end. No doubt it's one of the several hikers who walked through after dark last night before the storm. Glad they weren't caught in that.
The seven miles to route 60 are relatively flat, except the last two miles after Brown Mountain Creek shelter which rise 700 feet to the road on it's way to 4059-foot Bald Knob. Brown Mountain Creek used to hold an old ex-slave community of sharecroppers, according to historical interpretation signs (these are highly unusual for being so far from any touristy trailhead). Ninety years later it's a dense second-growth forest with no visible trace of a settlement under all the foliage.
It's the first day of summer, which means it's Naked Hiking Day. I feel no need to try it this year. It'd be great to get these sticky clothes away from my body, but the pack is just as bad. Plus I'd have to put all those damp clothes on again later and the transition is the toughest part.
So at route 60 I'm determined to get into the town of Buena Vista to dry off, do laundry, eat, and shower if possible. Otherwise I'll be miserable for the next three days til I reach Waynesboro. I plan to return to the trail this afternoon and continue over Bald Knob.
It's over 9 miles to town on a narrow winding mountain highway with tractor-trailer traffic, and of course there's no cell service to call for a ride. I haven't had service since leaving Glasgow. So a hitch is necessary. I was warned route 60 would be a hard hitch because there's nowhere to turn off. But that's not the case. There's a pull off right at the trailhead on the west-bound side (towards town) perfect for pulling over. There's even an overlook with a picnic table and loop for parking. It should be ideal. But the reason it's a hard hitch is because no one stops! In every state I'm told how wonderful the people are and how they are happy to give hikers a ride. Virginia is so much better than further south everyone tells me! But I stand there looking as pathetic and non-threatening as possible for well over an hour and 36 cars go by towards town (yes, I counted). Logging trucks, dump trucks, pickups, contractors, family cars, SUVs, and coupes. Not a one even slows down. It's the top of a steep hill so it's either a truck coming up in low gear followed by impatient drivers, or it's someone zooming through with barely a passing glance. There's a gravel road that enters on the south side, and even though I catch the eye and even talk with a couple drivers waiting to turn out, they blow me off. 
Then there's the utility contractor who parks in the overlook loop behind where I'm hitching. He takes the cake. He's a fiftyish good-ol-boy type from Florida missing some teeth and common decency. He pulls up in his truck five minutes after I get there. When I offer gas money for a ride he tells me he's got no room, motioning to the trash sitting in the passenger seat. He asks if I'm out of gas or sumpthin'. Since I'm clearly wearing an enormous backpack and there is no other car in sight I realize I'm dealing with someone unfamiliar with hiking and possibly not the sharpest tool in the shed. After a brief explanation of my situation I leave him be as he fiddles with his phone. But an hour later with no other bites I approach him again to ask if he has cell service so I can call a taxi (hint hint). He's snoozing. I wake him all friendly like. No service, he says. Sure I can't pay you for a ride? He's already told me he's going to Lexington to meet other contractors so I know I'm right on his way. Sorry, bub, he only got two and a half hours sleep last night, doesn't know where his buddies are, needs to get to a place where he can call them, blah, blah, give me a break. I figured out you were a jerk long ago, no need to provide more evidence. 
So I decide to hoof it into town. Yikes! Yes, I am that wet and miserable. But it's mostly downhill, right? I can do 9+ miles in under 3 hours on pavement. Well, that may be okay on a jogging path but dodging trucks and crossing the road every time there's a blind curve ahead is no fun. But at least I'm getting somewhere! I pass a few homes and wonder if I were to stop to ask to use their phone would they call the police on me? I'm too frustrated to even try. But hey, guess who passes me about two miles down? Yep, Mr. No-Sleep-No-Service-No-Room himself. Guess he woke up.
I get about three miles down in an hour with six more to go. Then a lifeline appears in the form of a red sports car. It pulls off at a gravel driveway ahead and I figure he's visiting the house, but then he rolls down the window and asks if I'm going to town! Why, ye-es! Yes I am! It's Eric Templin, a local hiker. It's his day off and he was on his way to see if anyone needed a lift at the trailhead. I very gratefully jump in as we zoom down to Buena Vista. Eric is a 44-year-old vet on a pension who plans to thruhike as soon as he can pull it together. His cherry red sports car is spotless and would struggle to fit more than one passenger, let alone their packs. Yet here he is anyway.
Once again I've found that hikers mostly get hitches from other hikers, not from random locals, no matter how ""hiker-friendly"" the area is. I've found this personally in Great Barrington, Manchester, Hanover, Gorham, Monson, Millinocket, and now Buena Vista. Only once have I ever gotten a hitch from a non-hiker, and that was in the heart of the White Mountains at Crawford Notch (even there my return hitch was another hiker). I guess it's difficult to appreciate someone's predicament if you've never been there yourself. So when people tell you it's easy to get a hitch at such-and-such a place, ask them if they've personally gotten one and who picked them up. More than likely it's a hiker or someone who knows one, or they're just passing along what someone else told them.
Eric, my trail angel for this trip, drops me at the Budget Inn and reluctantly takes gas money. It's taken almost three hours to reach town so I've decided to make this a Nero (near zero mile) day and stay overnight. No one's at the front desk. I call their number and a tired voice says she has a smoking room. No non-smoking? Sorry, I won't get to cleaning them today - too tired! I traipse over to look at the smoking room. The owner, an older Indian woman, meets me. I reluctantly accept the room given no other option, but then plead again for non-smoking, I just need some sheets and towels, don't worry about cleaning! She relents and fixes one up for me that another hiker (thankfully a neat one) just vacated. It's clean enough for me. What I really need is the air conditioning anyway. She is her own maid, she tells me, because no one in town is willing to work hard and clean the rooms properly. Plus people want to be paid cash so they can keep their government benefits. She will sell the place and get out of town as soon as she can find a buyer. It is one of only two motels in the area, and closest to town, yet it is dilapidated and has far more rooms than there seems demand for. She is used to hikers though, and there is even a hiker box.
After taking a much-needed shower (Eric kindly reminded me I stink), and laying everything I own out to dry, I grab my laundry and walk the mile to the laundromat. Since it's far from the motel I'm out for the rest of the afternoon. I end up with twenty dollars worth of quarters at the laundromat thanks to giving my last small bill for gas money. But I'm fortunate to unload most of them on another patron headed for the change machine later. While the laundry churns I walk over to the small library in the old Main Street part of town. There is not much in town outside of a few school and community buildings, convenience stores, and a few mom-and-pop restaurants. 
One of them, Don Tequila's Authentic Mexican, hits the spot. It's a popular place for families at the dinner hour. I order an ungodly amount of food that requires two plates for only eleven dollars and eat it all while I watch Austria and Denmark try fruitlessly to break a 1-1 tie in the World Cup. My body was craving something smothered in cheese and it certainly got it. The Chile Pellena (cheese-stuffed hot pepper) was excellent if you ever get the chance.
While the laundry spun I replanned the last two days of this trip. I've come 79 miles since Daleville three days ago. I won't make it to Black Rock Gap, which is 75 miles away, but I knew that from the first day when the humidity started melting me. I won't push for Rockfish Gap (Waynesboro) either which would require 55 miles in two days. There are major climbs and descents ahead. So I set my sights on Reed's Gap, 36 miles out, and arrange a shuttle for Saturday afternoon back to Waynesboro to get my car. I'll knock out the toughest terrain around the Priest now, and come back some other time for a couple easy days to finish the 39 miles around Waynesboro.
Now I just need to find a way back to the trail tomorrow...
Safe, cool, and dry at last on the Appalachian Trail!","Pedlar's River bridge
",Buena Vista,"Jun 21, Thu",6.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595637,"It rained again heavily last night, but I'm waking up in a motel and the morning is comfortably cool. The mountains are shrouded in fog. I call for a shuttle back to the trail and grab breakfast at BK across from the Budget Inn. I'm ready for another two days. Hopefully they'll be a little drier.
Gary Serra shows up right at 9:30 as promised, but I'm still stuffing everything that had been out to dry around the room back into my pack. Hope I didn't forget anything!
Back at route 60 I head up into the woods. It's a 2000 foot climb right off the bat. But it's not very steep. At least, it doesn't feel that way today. It's still cool and the humidity is noticeably lower. I find I need far less water and few if any breaks. I pass Booger Bear again halfway up. Haven't seen him for three days. Near the top I meet Iron Man, a fiftyish thruhiker attempting to finish in four months. He started late, on May 3. As we ascend the fog condenses and sprinkles on us.
Fog shrouds our view at the top. We undulate over the ridge line. Going over Cole Mountain there's a large grassy open area and the fog drifts aimlessly about. 
Down at Hog Camp Gap there's a troop of boy scouts on their second of a nine day hike north to Shenandoah. They were slated to go to Philmont this summer until the fires there cancelled their high adventure program. As a passing shower hits the group leader sends all the boys scurrying to cover their packs. Iron Man is studying the signs here looking for the promised spring as he's low on water. It's a half mile away though. I've drank very little so I give him some of mine.
A couple miles later I catch up with Juice and the girls I passed climbing Bluff two days ago. They're relaxing and goofing around while I get some water. I move on and soon after near Salt Log Gap the skies open up for a good soaking shower. I put on my poncho and walk through it for an hour until it tails off. I consider stopping at Seeley-Woodworth shelter, but figure I can't wait out showers that could go on intermittently all day so I keep moving. 
The tread is fairly nice here and the runoff is manageable. There are some rocky spots, more than south of route 60. I reach Spy Rock which normally has a great view from a bouldering climb. It's not presently raining so I drop the pack and explore. It's a maze of trails that dead-end at the boulders and in rhododendron groves. It takes awhile to find a safe way up with everything wet. It's a huge slab of bedrock, sort of like a bald in Maine. Of course there's nothing to see but fog. I've largely lost my orientation without the sun and have to scout out my way back to the trail. Of course it starts raining again while I'm trying to pick my way down the steep slabs!
Back in my poncho on the trail I walk for miles in the steady rain, heavy at times. Finally after two hours I reach The Priest shelter, my destination for the night. The shelter is full with a close-knit crew of thruhikers including Medicine Man and others I saw in Glasgow. But the rain has abated at a perfect time. I pitch my tent, make dinner (potatoes, bacon, and cheese, yum), and hang the bear bag amazingly quickly just before the rain starts up again. A little luck for once! The rain continues into the night as some less fortunate laggards arrive and set up.
So for now I am safe, warm enough and dry enough on the Appalachian Trail.","Buena Vista
",The Priest Shelter,"Jun 22, Fri",20.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595653,"Well, it poured again overnight. That's three nights in a row. The trees drip onto the tent for hours afterward, making it hard to tell if the rain has stopped. Moot point, I suppose, since everything's already wet. Must be splashback coming in under the rainfly or the high humidity, but my shoes are more waterlogged than when I left them in the vestibule last night. My pack, which was fairly dry, is now soaked, probably from wicking runoff from the ground. The tent fly and footprint and bottom of the inner tent are sopping wet. I just shove it all in the sack. It doesn't matter. I'm walking out today.
After an oatmeal breakfast which seems to consume the last of my fuel - that, or my microscopic stove is developing a clog - I hike out for The Priest. The Priest is a 4000+ foot promontory, the highest northbounders will see for another thousand miles. It's still shrouded in fog this morning. Ah well! Last year most thruhikers I talked to agreed that The Priest was the toughest climb on the AT (they hadn't yet seen New Hampshire). But I don't think they meant the 2300 foot climb out of Buena Vista to the ridgeline of The Priest. That was time-consuming but not especially difficult or steep. I'm pretty sure they meant instead the climb following The Priest. The AT drops precipitously 3100 feet to the Tye River immediately after The Priest, then climbs right back up 3000 feet or so. But it's not the elevation gain so much (the climb out of NOC is higher I believe) as it is the incline and especially the rocks and bouldering. This is unusual for Virginia and not something northbounders have seen in quantity before. One peak, the Chimney, is a steep boulder scramble, followed by several more bouldery sections both vertical and horizontal leading up to Three Ridges. While it pales in comparison to northern climbs like Moosilauke, Kinsman, Webster Cliffs, Wildcat, Mahoosuc Arm, Baldpate, Saddleback, Crocker, Whitecap, and, of course, Katahdin, it's the last really tough climb for northbounders until then so the memory stands out.
I pass a number of dayhikers and weekenders in this section. Most are southbound, which makes for a less daunting ascent to Three Ridges. There's a popular loop with the AT called the Mau-Har trail. In fact Mau-Har is a blue-blaze shortcut that lops about four miles off the AT's climb up Three Ridges by blazing more directly between two shelters. It's also more challenging and rougher terrain, so would-be blue-blazers don't save much effort.
Trail maintainers from the Tidewater Appalachian Trail Club are out in force this humid morning. They take care of a 10.7 mile section of trail, but are based 200 miles away in the Virginia tidewater area (Norfolk), the longest commute for any AT club. I meet five volunteers spread along the climb, with others unseen on Mau-Har. Because we're in a designated wilderness area in a national forest, they can't use power tools. They use a swing blade and clippers to cut down the vegetation encroaching on the trail, and two-man saws to remove deadfall. The first volunteer I encounter grimaces because one of the bolts has just flown off his swing blade. He starts trying to jerryrig a fix with a carabiner. The second volunteer I meet, several hundred yards up, immediately heads down with his supply of spares when I mention his companion's predicament. Thank you to the volunteers from Tidewater for keeping this section of trail clear!
I have a pickup scheduled at Reed's Gap at 3pm. My pace has been barely over 2 mph all day so for a 15.5 mile day it looks like I'll be there right on time. But after Three Ridges it's ""all downhill"" and I end up almost 30 minutes early. That's okay, because Katie ""No Worries"" from Stanimal's is already here. It's like she read my mind! She's got a family headed to Spy Rock to meet a thruhiking relative. Rather than hang out in the car for the hour to drop them off, I'm dropped off down the road at the locally famous Devil's Backbone Brewery. 
Devil's Backbone is an enormous complex with large outdoor pavilions and bars like a beer garden, with kids running across lawns alongside young men tossing frisbees. A massive lodge houses a restaurant and the brewing operation. On this beautiful warm Saturday afternoon the place is bustling with multi-generational families, couples, and groups of twentysomethings. 
Hikers love to hitch to Devil's Backbone and tent overnight after a good dinner and a sampling of the craft beers. The brewery often drives them back to the trail in the morning (after offering them breakfast, of course). And in fact as I walk in I immediately bump into two of the thruhikers from the shelter this morning. Weird, thought I left them miles behind! But they've hitched not from Reed's Gap but from Rt 56 at the Tye River, so are still about twelve trail miles behind me. Sometimes coming off trail feels like stepping out of the space-time continuum and meeting people from another era you would never encounter if you kept steadily marching through time.
I fill up on a lager and french dip sandwich, watching Germany slowly lose to Sweden in the World Cup. Once Katie returns we share a celebratory drink - me for completing a section, her for moving on from Stanimal's soon to her next adventure, which may eventually include opening a hostel of her own. We head back to Waynesboro where I get a hot shower at the hostel. The hiker guests are hanging out in the living room eating dinner and watching an AT documentary. As I pass through it drones ""Then the trail moves into Pennsylvania with her miles of rocks, known as 'the place where boots go to die'..."" The hikers chatter and give each other concerned glances. It's like a ghost story for thruhikers. Be good or the Pennsylvania rocks will getcha! Oh well, they'll think it sucks when they're there. Then they'll get to NH and wonder what they were complaining about!
The long drive home is fortunately uneventful. My commutes to Virginia will be on hold for awhile. I'll be volunteering at summer scout camps and vacationing with the family. Not sure when my next section will be. Still 250 miles to go in Virginia and over 700 to finish the trail. One step at a time!","The Priest Shelter
",Reed's Gap,"Jun 23, Sat",15.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601497,"I'm off on another section hike in my quest to finish the AT. This one takes me to southwestern Virginia, an unexpectedly long stretch of trail between Damascus, near the Tennessee border, and Daleville, north of Roanoke. 259 miles in all, about half of the AT in Virginia and longer than any other state except Maine, which is about 270. It passes through the Grayson Highlands, the Blue Ridge, and ridgelines bordering West Virginia. Near the end I'll pass Virginia's Triple Crown of hiking destinations - Dragon's Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs. I'm hoping along the way to visit some of the secluded farms that have opened their doors as hiker hostels. Once finished, I'll be done Virginia except for a 40 mile section around Waynesboro. After numerous trips this year it will be satisfying to cross off this state and make it number 11 on my completed list. Georgia, NC, and Tennessee will remain.
Two months ago I sectioned from Daleville north to Reeds Gap near Waynesboro. That was a very humid and very wet week. But par for the course this season. I also hit plenty of rain in the White Mountains earlier this month with my oldest son, Phantump, and in Shenandoah back in June with my daughter Snickers. But the weather looks much more promising here for the next few days. A nice change of pace.
I drive down to Daleville from my home west of Philadelphia, a five and a half hour drive that starts before 5 am. After grabbing a snack I park the car at Valley Cleaners, right next to where the AT crosses Route 220. Homer Witcher, my shuttle driver, tells me they don't mind hikers using their lot and the car will be safer here than at the park-and-ride lot just down the road. Works for me. 
Homer pulls up right on time in a small sedan. He's thin and gaunt and white-haired. At first it seems like he's infirm, but I soon learn he's anything but. On the way down I hear how his wife Therese came home one day exasperated with work and convinced him to thruhike the trail with her to reduce their stress. And take their 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son too! That was sixteen years ago, and they all finished. Now they spend hundreds of hours a year maintaining a hundred-mile section of trail south of Daleville. That includes upkeep on sixteen shelters, such as relocating the privies regularly and digging new pits. Homer is seventy-six, but seems to have the energy of a man half his age. He ran his first marathon two years ago, in under four hours, beating his athletic daughter (who is currently hiking the Long Trail and working on running half-marathons in every state). His aerospace engineer son also does trail maintenance in his spare time. Every anniversary Homer and his wife hike up to McAfee Knob where they were married, and every birthday he runs a half-marathon.
The two hours down I-81 pass quickly and soon we are cruising down Laurel Avenue in Damascus. It's a busy and colorful little town, but not quite what I expected. There are relatively few buildings and few are historical or compactly arranged like the Main Streets of so many small towns. Under the new paint it still looks like the old logging town that nearly died fifty years ago, and revived thanks to tourism from the AT and the Virginia Creeper Trail bike path.  Bike rental outlets dot the town and bikers are everywhere. Not surprisingly, there are no hikers in sight. This time of year the northbounders are long gone and the early southbounders are only just starting to trickle through. 
I walk from the town hall, facing across from a wood frame building under construction that will be an Appalachian Trail Center. It's not clear whether it's a project of the town or the Appalachian Trail Conservancy which maintains regional centers in other states. Damascus is frequently viewed as the premier trail town on the AT, so it certainly seems overdue. At the east end of town I stop for lunch at Mojo's, a last hurrah before entering the wilderness for three days. I've been wanting to try Mojo's since reading Hungry Cat's journal this spring. He was stuck tending to an injured foot in Damascus for over a week and seems to have eaten here three times a day. My reuben is tasty, but the ambience is not the small town diner I expected. Rather it's an upscale sandwich shop geared to the tourist trade (all cyclists at the moment).
The AT follows the Virginia Creeper gravel bike path out of town before veering off to climb a mountain while the cyclists continue along the river where the old lumber rail line ran. The weather is perfect for hiking. Slightly cool, low humidity, blue skies. I climb through rich green hemlock, maple, oak, and rhododendron forests. This is entirely second-growth forest, having been clear cut in the early twentieth century when this was the largest lumber-producing county in the nation.
Suddenly I'm startled by a large black rat snack slithering across the trail, trying to get away from me as my feet flail to avoid it. I'm almost as startled a few minutes later to see a southbounder who looks (and smells) like he might be a thruhiker. But he's gone before I can ask. I'm surprised any have gotten this far since the opening of Katahdin on June 1st. Other than him, I see two dayhikers and a number of cyclists. Late in the day I pass two southbound section hikers trying to suck water out of a very slow and sad looking stream.
After sixteen miles I stop at Lost Mountain Shelter and am not surprised to have the place to myself. I can't remember ever having a shelter to myself. There have been warnings about bear activity and food stealing north of here so I take care in hanging the bear bag well away from the shelter. It takes some time to find a tree with a branch strong enough and at the right height to hang a bag. I settle for a deadfall suspended horizontally between two trees.
After some potatoes and noodles it's off to bed. A full moon is rising in the east. The night is chilly but hopefully that promises another great day for hiking.","Damascus

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601505,"It's chilly in the morning but the thermometer says 54. Still, I can see my breath. Maybe I'm just not used to the cold yet. After oatmeal and applesauce I hike out after 8, later than I expected. The sun didn't rise til nearly 7 and I slept in. Last night it was very windy and tree debris kept banging on the metal roof. That and a sharp bang from the picnic table around 3 in the morning put me on edge. Not to mention the coyote howls and the occasional scratching sounds outside. But I never saw any animals and the food bag was untouched in the morning. 
Most of the day I hike through Grayson Highlands. It's an amazingly beautiful area with summits of open grassland and rocky knobs. Much like the alpine regions of New Hampshire and Maine. I meet a number of the resident wild ponies, who were put here in the 1960s by the Forest Service to graze and keep the meadows from reforesting. The ponies are incredibly fat and are completely accustomed to humans, even coming up to me expecting to be petted (don't do this, or feed them - keep them wild). Free range horned cows also frequent the area. They and the ponies leave lots of presents on the trail. I am also constantly passing through fence stiles that keep the animals from wandering too far.
It's Saturday and dayhikers are out in force to climb Mt Rogers, Virginia's tallest peak at 5729 feet. It's forested and there's no view but, check!, I did it anyway even though it was a mile out of my way. There are a number of backpackers out as well, nearly all for a long weekend. I don't see any long distance hikers. In one register the last thruhiker to sign was July 16th (Rocket). He'll need to be a rocket to get to Katahdin before it closes in mid-October.
The weather continues to be gorgeous. Blue skies and high in the 70s. I get more sun than I will the rest of this trip and it feels good. I wish Sara and the kids were here to experience this amazing place and the wonderful views. Maybe a day hike sometime. 
I reach Old Orchard Shelter at 7 where two weekenders I met in the morning are staying. They are both from Scranton out for a 30 mile hike to Dickey Gap. I make another pot of instant pasta that takes 20 minutes to boil and cook. Not a very efficient use of fuel. While I'm waiting I hang the food bag. This is one of the shelters where camping is not recommended due to recent bear activity. But there's not even a bear box here, unlike the last two shelters.
The sun seems to be setting later than yesterday. I've been hiking east most of the day so maybe that made the difference of a few minutes. The crickets are loud this evening. Which is fine, it muffles the snoring!","Lost Mountain Shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601558,"Looking back I didn't appreciate the rarity of Grayson Highlands enough. The miles of open land and interesting formations along with free range animals is unique along the trail. Now that I am back to the green tunnel today I appreciate that unique landscape more.
This morning is a little warmer. I'm up a bit earlier but still take an hour to finish morning chores and head out after 7:30, saying goodbye to my weekender shelter-mates. It's a cool and cloudy morning, perfect for hiking. I pass through several National Forest wilderness areas today. There are very few hikers about. A couple miles into the hike I walk a short way down a road to use the porta-potty at one of the horse campgrounds in the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area. The Virginia Highlands Horse Trail runs for 50 or more miles through here and along with many other area horse trails attracts a lot of riders. I saw some yesterday when the AT crossed horse trails (horses are not allowed on the AT itself), including a couple riders dressed up like cowboys. In the campground are at least a dozen horse trailers with horses tied to hitching posts and owners scurrying to feed them and get ready for the day's ride.
Later in the morning I pass Comer's Creek Falls, a pretty cascade over bedrock. I want to take a dip but there's no bathing pool, so I just splash on some water to cool down. I learn from a info board at a creek crossing later the difference between a freestone and limestone creek bed, the former being covered by movable river rocks and the latter basically just bedrock. 
The trail continues up and down over small mountains and ridges and past deserted gravel road crossings for many miles. The rhododendron are often quite dense. Around noon it starts to drizzle but the canopy mostly shields me as it slowly picks up. I cross a meadow and realize I am now too wet to bother throwing on my poncho so I hope for the best. The shower strengthens for a while but sure enough the sun comes out after 90 minutes and I start to dry out. After that the ridges have cool breezes but the valleys are very humid.
I reach Partnership Shelter at 4. It's empty and I will be the only inhabitant tonight. It's near the Mount Rogers NRA Visitor Center, where my guide says you can get pizza delivered. I could alternatively get a ride into town, but the shelter is a comfortable well-built two story log cabin with a shower(!) so who needs town if I can have food delivered? Unfortunately the visitor center closes at 4 on Sunday and is absolutely deserted when I arrive there at 5 minutes after. And of course I have no cell reception. But Glory be! there is a free phone on an outside wall with numbers for local hiker services including Perfect Pizza. So I place an order for more than I can probably eat to satisfy the delivery minimum. There's an advantage to having other hikers to split the cost.
I take a shower while waiting and even though it's cold it's one of the best showers I've ever had. Someone even left soap and shampoo. But for drying my little dish towel must suffice. Feeling amazingly refreshed I meet the delivery guy and find out after finishing a small pizza that, sure enough, I won't be finishing that calzone tonight too. I can't hang it with the bear bag, so my best option to keep it for breakfast is to leave it in the enclosed privy with it's heavy door to keep out any nocturnal prowlers. We'll see what happens.
There's occasional road noise from route 16 but the crickets drown out much of it. I think I'll sleep well tonight. Tomorrow I will pass through Atkins and stay at the Appalachian Dreamer hostel on a working farm.","Old Orchard Shelter
",Partnership Shelter,"Aug 26, Sun",23.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601587,"A warm night passed quietly at Partnership Shelter. Despite the shelter facing east, only my alarm got me up shortly after six. I feel lazy, being used to a 5am wake up from the sun during my June hike. The calzone is sitting right where I left it, and after a couple unsure bites my stomach decides it is definitely hungry and finishes it off. This is a great shelter and I'm sorry to leave but it's time to press on. 
The Mount Rogers visitor center is still deserted as I pass at 7:30. The morning passes uneventfully, mostly following a ridge north towards the Great Valley where I-81 passes. I see numerous white-tailed deer today, running fleetly away from me. Not your tame, block-the-trail, Shenandoah deer are these. The skies are clear and the temperature and humidity climb but are manageable. I am on webwalker duty all day, collecting countless webs on my arms, legs, and my hair and face. I'm not used to this for more than the time it takes to reach the next shelter or stealth site. It just shows that no one else has been through this area, maybe for a day or two. And indeed, I see no other hikers all morning.
In late morning I reach the Settlers Museum, showcasing a farm and one-room schoolhouse from circa 1890 and artifacts from German and Scotch-Irish settlement of the region in the mid-18th century. The visitors center is closed but I get to talking with a local walking his rotund dog. He retired early from management at the Pepsi plant in Wytheville where they put out a quarter million bottles a day, and he's full of stories about local soft drink lore. This is where Mountain Dew started (sold out to Pepsi in 1965 for a paltry million bucks) and where Dr. Pepper's inventor got his inspiration from a Dr. Charles Pepper, the unamused father of a girl he attempted to court. The schoolhouse is a restful spot complete with hiker box where I snag some oatmeal. There are whimsical lists of the Puritan-like rules for teachers (men may take one evening to court, two if they attend church regularly) and punishments for students like 4 lashes for playing in the creek.  
Down to I-81 I go through meadows and over rail tracks. It's my first taste of commerce since Damascus three days ago. I get a half pound burger at the Barn, famous for homestyle cooking. It tastes amazing on Texas toast. The waitress is very accommodating, letting me charge my phone, fill my water bottle, and stamp my AT passport. I joke that I'm so high maintenance. 
I grab a couple drinks from the gas station and head north under the interstate. Lost in thought I cover much of the ten miles. I told Mack of the Appalachian Dreamer Hiker Hostel to expect me at the road at 5:30 and I realize I'm going slower than expected. So I get my second wind from an iced tea (""slightly sweet"" is the least sugary option they had here in sweet tea country), and charge up Walker Mountain. It's a steady incline of 450 feet per mile over two miles and I reach the top in 32 minutes, surprising myself that I had that much energy so late in the day. On the way I passed my first hikers of the day. Yay! I'm off web duty! The downhill to the road is a bit of a struggle though as it winds through overgrown fields and meadows with the trail barely discernible. Someone needs to take a DR mower to this field. But I'm right on time and Mack Spainour has just pulled up in his pickup truck. He's got white-haired stubble on his head and face and has a strong southern accent. He's pointing out a rattlesnake in the grass on the opposite side of the road. I'll watch out for him tomorrow. 
The three mile ride to his farm showcases the bucolic and serene valley. We see no other cars but have to avoid a squirrel, chipmunk, deer, and two dogs before pulling up his gravel drive to a house perched over steeply rolling hills. The neighbor's beef cows graze on part of his land, and his own donkeys and goats mow the pastures close to the house. 
After shower and a dinner of hot dogs, corn from the neighbor, and excellent home-made pickles I sit out on the front stoop overlooking a majestic sweep of the valley while my laundry spins. It's golden hour and the ridge I climbed over is highlighted, with colorful clouds above. Suddenly I spot a rainbow prominently falling from clouds to ridgeline. I hear hardly a sound other than the chirping of crickets, the lowing of cattle, and Mack's cat meowing to be let in.
The bunk room and bath are spotless and have comfortable mattresses and pillows. I am, unsurprisingly, the only guest in this slow season between north- and southbounders. There's a barber chair in the kitchen Mack uses to trim unruly hiker hair (on request), and a jukebox featuring Patsy Cline, Chubby Checkers but predating the Beatles. Mack's restored that and built the bunkroom and generally restored and renovated this property to make it a perfect hostel since he moved here from south of Raleigh after thruhiking in 2005. He's now 75. I haven't heard this place mentioned much among thruhikers but it is an oasis worth your time in this stretch of peaceful hidden valleys.
Tomorrow there's likely some showers but I'll be heading out refreshed and basically dayhiking to the next hostel, Saint Luke's, twenty miles up the trail. I never paid much attention to this section of Virginia since it lacks any traditional highlights, but it may turn out to be one of my most pleasant stretches.","
",Appalachian Dreamer Hiker Hostel (VA 610),"Aug 27, Mon",21.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601667,"Up early at the Appalachian Dreamer hostel for a big pancake breakfast. Mack's been a fantastic host. There are a couple of other hostels in the immediate area (one of which is only open during Nobo season) but it's hard to imagine them being more hospitable.
Heading out the door I notice my inner soles lying under the bunk where I'd left them to dry. I had put on my shoes without them! Guess I would have felt that at the first rock or root. 
Mack drives me back to the trail on VA 610. The trail winds up a hill through cow pastures but has recently been rerouted and is very difficult to follow. Dewy grass soaks my shoes. Eventually I return to the forest and follow the trail over Brushy and Lynn Camp Mountains. The sky is clear but gradually clouds and remains cool. At a gravel road I meet Huck, a northbounder hiking all of Virginia. He's a young programmer from Charlottesville but his knees are hurting so he's only going to the next shelter. 
That shelter is on top of Chestnut Ridge, a 4.5 mile long and 2100 foot vertical climb. After some huffing and puffing up the steepest part, I follow the flattening trail as it opens into a wide mowed strip between trees and then through broad meadows with views across the valleys south. I can no longer see the Great Valley with I-81 and Atkins as it's blocked by the Walker Mountain ridge I climbed yesterday. 
At the summit is a stone, fully-closed shelter with bunks. A southbound section hiker about my age is taking a break. He's doing the mirror of my hike, Daleville to Damascus, and is coming from the hostel I intend to stay at tonight. He demurs when I ask about it except to warn me I need to arrange in advance if I want an early ride back to the trail.
On the way down Chestnut Knob I meet two more sobo section hikers. After barely seeing a soul for two days I'm overwhelmed by three in a half hour! The first is Mr. Hiker who's also working on Virginia. The other is at the bottom of the hill looking for water. There are no streams or springs running for many miles, just a pond up on the ridge that looked less than appealing. He's going to see if the hostel will run him up a gallon of water. It reminds me to always check my sources before I start my day.
I wend my way over a bumpy ridgeline for another five miles and can feel my energy draining. The sun is out again and the temperature has climbed, intensifying the humidity that has been high all day. Plus I've eaten all my snacks and skipped lunch since it's a relatively short day and the hostel provides dinner. So I'm sweaty, tired and hungry when I reach the gravel road and call the hostel for pickup. I get a message saying they're out til 5. It's 4:53 and I'm antsy. Their roadside sign says to walk downhill 1.5 miles to a gate and a white house if there's no answer. Okay, I leave a message to come meet me as I'm walking down and start off. 
One car passes as I descend Burke's Garden Road, a steep one-lane gravel road with switchbacks and a sharp drop-off, but it's not them. After half an hour the trees break and I see the valley. I reach a gate. But it's a livestock gate. I look out over the valley. Sure enough, there's a white house way down there across multiple pastures. A wooden sign fallen on the ground indicates the hostel is 800 yards off.
So I wrestle with the gate and start hiking another half mile over rough fields mined with cow patties. The phone rings and it's Mark from the hostel. He apologizes for being away and helps me navigate through the maze of fencing and herd of cattle to the house. 
Mark is fifty-something with an English accent and hands me a soda when I ask for something cold. The farm house is a beaut from another age with high ceilings and solid wood doors, but is a little rough around the edges, disorganized, and dirty. A huge German Shepherd puppy and some cats wander around looking for affection and crickets to chase. 
After a shower and starting the laundry I chat up Mark and his pal Farmer, a lean, prematurely-graying AT enthusiast who helps out on the farm when he's not working in Roanoke. They seem like pleasant guys. They've run the hostel for a couple years. A lot of hikers came through last year but it's off by half this year. They think people were driven off trail by the late wintry and wet weather. That's possible. But I can see now why the southbounder was hesitant to endorse the place. After dropping some hints about eating (I don't mind walking two miles off trail for food! Hey, can I help with dinner?), there is no indication anyone intends to cook. The TV blares loudly as Mark watches Youtube news clips and tells me earnestly about military conspiracies. The bunks have such thin padding it's like lying directly on the slats, so I end up sleeping on the wooden floor. 
Finally near 8pm I ask directly about dinner. Mark looks through the fridge and offers up ribs or pork chops. Whatever is good, I say. Ribs it is! Oh, but they're frozen. Then I'm good with anything, I say (can we please eat soon?) So Mark disappears while Farmer and I chat on the porch overlooking the cow pastures and he explains the grazing business model, the health of one of their pigs, and all the mowing necessary. Mark returns to say since the ribs are thawing it will be three hours til dinner. Oh, wait, I say, that's a long time, let's do those pork chops. The ribs are already prepped though, so we wait. It's awkward. I'm a guest lucky to be here, so I grit my teeth and think how I'd be fed and going to sleep in the shelter by now. I try to nap. 
We end up eating literally at midnight with Mark hauling a heaping plate of ribs into the bunkroom. It has no place to eat, so I have to ask if I can take it to the dining room. He and Farmer eat in front of the TV. I'm more tired than hungry and the ribs need a few more hours to be tender so I don't eat a ton. I would have been happy with grilled cheese! Before hitting the sack I arrange a 7:30 departure with Farmer. We'll see what happens!","Appalachian Dreamer Hiker Hostel (VA 610)
",Garden Mountain hostel (VA 623),"Aug 28, Tue",20.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601823,"To my mild surprise Farmer is ready to go around 8. The truck needs warming up and the engine kicks like a mule. Mark is nowhere to be seen. It's a five mile ride to the trail, half on gravel. Burke's Garden is a plateau in a bowl surrounded by mountains, Virginia's highest valley. It's beautiful, but takes forever to get anywhere. Before I exit I settle up with Farmer. He has the nerve to charge for my midnight dinner and for the ride back to the trail after I saved him a trip to get me yesterday. These two guys have no business putting out a shingle.
At the trail head is a car and large tent 50 yards into the woods. I learn later a trail angel named Gary hangs out there, though he wasn't there yesterday. Gary apparently partnered with Mark on the hostel but they fell out over investment in the septic system or some such. And my story of a late dinner does not surprise those who know the place. Though midnight seems to be the new record. Things start to make more sense why it is such an awkward place.
Eager to put this experience behind me, I put it in high gear and speed along the ridge line. The tread is much better here and the elevation changes are minimal. The mornings are still cool and rain does not threaten all day. I'm encouraged that I will be able make my 28 mile day but I'm not feeling it. Only the knowledge that falling short will make the following days harder and possibly cause me to fall short of Daleville pushes me on.
That, and knowing there's a little diner at route 52 north of Bland halfway through. Food rules my hiking life.
I'm breaking webs much of the morning which means no one's been around, but as I reach the road I meet a seventy-ish genial hiker with full white beard. He started at Springer in April and has only made it this far. His wife has been slacking him with their camper and he's waiting for her now. He promised he'd stop at the end of August so this is almost it for this year. What's crazy is that he started April 16, the same day I did. Our AT tag numbers are 2273 and 2277. I probably passed him climbing the Approach Trail in the first half hour when he was clean-shaven. I hope I was pleasant! And here by sheer chance we meet again. What a crazy world!
The Mountain Outpost diner/store is a great lunch stop (or breakfast, which I missed). I get a burger and milkshake, a little resupply, and a couple sandwiches to pack out. Everything is so cheap. Overhearing conversations about truck driving, digging swales on large tracts of land that even struggling families seem to own, and brags about children with careers in the trades making $17/hr, shows this is a very different world than suburban Philly.
Back on the trail it follows a road over I-77 with truck traffic roaring and dives hundreds of feet before returning to the forest. The going continues to be relatively easy and only the rising humidity makes it uncomfortable. Water sources continue to be few and poor. 
As I reach VA 611, a few miles from my destination, the Jenny Knob shelter, I decide to try the Lickskillet Hostel another mile further. I'm already hostel hopping so why not? Mongo the owner agrees to pick me up at the next road crossing. After 29 miles I emerge on VA 608 and Mongo is there early, waiting. 
His hostel is in a 1911 white clapboard church at a quiet rural intersection. The huge open space is cool and dry and filled with comfortable beds (not bunks!) as well as a common area and enormous TV. I have time for a quick outdoor shower and then we and a southbounder named Nacho Jim head to Wytheville a half hour away to satisfy Jim's craving for a dozen Taco Bell tacos.
Mongo has led a difficult life in his 35 years. He fell into the drug trade in Florida as a teen and did time. But he resolved to reform and found God. Four years ago he started hiking and worked for a hostel in Hot Springs. He eventually found this church for sale cheap to start his own hostel. Truly a labor of love, he enjoys helping hikers and goes well out of his way.
As if to prove it, he encourages me to slackpack tomorrow and is willing to pick me up 45 minutes away in Pearisburg when I finish. He asks only for donations and charges for nothing. We stay up late having the kinds of earnest discussions one has in a college dorm.  
The bed is the most comfortable rest I've gotten on this trip. Maybe on the entire trail.","Garden Mountain hostel (VA 623)
",Lickskillet Hostel (VA 608),"Aug 29, Wed",28.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601824,"Well rested, I decide to tackle another big mile day to Pearisburg. It's 31 miles. If I do it I'll be ahead of schedule and take the pressure off the rest of the trip. With rain forecast and tougher terrain north of Pearisburg now is the time to get the miles.
Mongo makes me some eggs with hot peppers to get me going and drops me at the trailhead a half mile down the road. As promised the trail is incredibly easy here with well-graded pine needle tread following ridgelines. But keeping up a fast pace for a second day is wearing and my feet are feeling the impact. I stop for two lunches, eating the sandwiches I packed out yesterday, as much to let my feet rest as to refuel. 
Water is abundant for the first 13 miles as I cross countless streams and creeks. But it is virtually non-existent for the last 18 miles except for a couple small pools at ""reliable"" springs. So I somehow manage to get by on the two liters I brought with me. Cool morning air and a cloudy afternoon help.
I pass three southbounders on the way. Milo and Windrider (a sailor) are flip-floppers while Solo is a true SOBO who started May 16th (shuttling back to Katahdin once it opened).
Thunderstorms crackle around me in seemingly every direction for most of the afternoon, but it only rains on me briefly and lightly. I happen to even be at Doc's Knob shelter when it does so I am completely unscathed. Too bad. I almost wanted a downpour just to cool me off. I find out later it did downpour just a few miles south on my hostelmates for the evening.
The monotony and foot-pounding drag on for eleven hours and the trail often becomes rocky, but finally I head down a 1500 foot descent into Pearisburg. Mongo is there to pick me up earlier than I expected. He's got the southbounder Solo and we're both eager to try the Mexican restaurant in town. 
Solo turns out to be author Kirk Ward Robinson and a three-time thruhiker who lives on the Tennessee farm his grandfather founded. He's gotten inspiration for several of his novels while hiking, including The Appalachian. 
After dinner we head out of town in Mongo's Toyota into a dark night. While going up route 100 in the middle of nowhere the front tire suddenly blows out. Backing down to a cross road to get off the narrow highway we grab the spare, switch it out, and find it too is flat. And no compressor in the car. Mongo tries some friends for help but no luck. A lonely closed store across the highway has a diesel tank but no air hose. I use Mongo's phone to call my insurer to request roadside service, an excruciatingly complicated process, and find it's not even covered if it's not my vehicle and the woman seems unable to distinguish Pearisburg from Petersburg (they're a couple hundred miles apart). 
Meanwhile a car has pulled into the store lot and a man gets out to start up the pickup that's been sitting there. Mongo goes over to see if he will help. As Mongo later relates, the man waited until he had loaded his gun before rolling down the window for Mongo. But fortunately he's a stand-up fellow once assured of our legitimate predicament and runs our flat spare down to Walmart to inflate it. Saved by the good fortune of this man stopping just at this time. And by having our incident across from the store rather than the completely empty stretch of highway ahead of us. 
Another late night, but after double-checking the tire at a gas station we finally reach the hostel for a well-deserved rest.","Lickskillet Hostel (VA 608)
",Pearisburg,"Aug 30, Thu",31.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602038,"I say goodbye to the Lickskillet Hostel today, and with it my hostel-hopping run. North of Pearisburg there are no towns or hostels until Catawba, 68 miles away. Mongo takes Solo and Windrider out first to slackpack back to the hostel. I take my time doing laundry and eating breakfast while I wait. Eventually we head down to Pearisburg where I pack out a lunch from the supermarket and head up to the trail on Cross Ave. Two southbounders are at the road but take off without saying much. 
The trail winds around Pearisburg, past an old cemetery holding Colonel Pearis, the town's founder, and over a highway bridge across the New River. It's my biggest river crossing on this trip and the biggest until at least the James River 140 trail miles north. I pass and chat with an overnight backpacker from Cleveland who's in the area on business. The trail then starts climbing back into the mountains. I hear the disconcerting rumble of a tree crashing to the forest floor nearby. It's maybe only the second time I've witnessed a tree falling in the forest. Descending into a small valley towards a road I cross paths with two young, fit-looking local boys who are dayhiking up and who ask hopefully if the top is near! It's only a 200-300 foot hill and the parking lot is closer than the peak, but I say something encouraging. I don't think to ask why they're climbing, since there's no view or anything interesting up there.
More than 2000 feet of climbing later I reach the ridge drenched with sweat. The humidity is high and I didn't start until 10 so it's already hot. I push myself on to the Rice Field Shelter for lunch. It rests on the edge of a large open summit with gorgeous views northwest across West Virginia. In fact the trail roughly follows the state line for the next ten miles so my left foot is in a different state than my right. 
I take a long break in the shelter. When I return to the field a Virginia Tech education student is taking in the view from a rocky promontory. She's recovering from an ankle injury and hasn't been able to get back up here since winter. I leave her to her reverie and hike on over the ridge.
The grades are easy and so is the tread, except for some rocky stretches. There are few trees and the trail corridor is mostly meadow. But much of the sun-drenched trail is overgrown and I have to fight my way through weeds and grasses, gaining all kinds of burrs and seeds on my clothes. There are wild apple trees over portions of the trail (or perhaps remnants of an old orchard) and I taste a few of their fruit. Most are mealy and I toss them immediately but a couple are sweet and give me an energy boost. 
Meanwhile, thunder has been rumbling in the distance and the skies have begun to darken. As if to relieve me of the humidity a cool wind starts blowing through. Seems like a shower should be upon me but it holds off for hours. Finally a light rain begins, more refreshing than anything, and peters out fairly soon. 
Despite a relatively short day, the last few miles down off the ridge to the shelter seem to take forever. While I didn't get wet from the light rain, all the rhododendrons and bushes along the trail did and they soak my clothes, shoes, and pack as I push through. The trail follows a stream down and it's roaring from runoff. I fill my water bags in about five seconds from the gushing stream before reaching Pine Swamp Branch Shelter.
The shelter is stone with wooden bunks on either side of a dirt floor with fireplace. I once again have it all to myself. I'd passed a sign in the morning warning of potential deadfalls near this shelter and not to use it, especially not to tent in the vicinity. One southbounder had told me yesterday to ignore this, that the place was in good shape.
So I go about drying clothes and making dinner. I prep the bear bag line on a branch before dark. Then, as I'm waiting on the noodles to cook and looking at tomorrow's elevation profile, an incredibly loud and extended crash rips through the air. A tree is collapsing maybe 50 yards away near the stream! I can't see it, but it must be tall and sounds like it's taking out other trees as it goes down. At this point it's dark and I'm not moving on to the next shelter. So I hope for the best and that the metal roof is sturdy.","Pearisburg
",Pine Swamp Branch Shelter,"Aug 31, Fri",20.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602037,"I'd arranged my bag in the shelter to catch the rising sun. Sure enough, what light can penetrate the trees shines through this morning. But I roll back over. I'm exhausted from the last few days heavy hiking, and from the late nights thanks to inept hostel dinner service, dorm room musings, and a blown tire. Mongo gave me a second trail name of ""Midnight"" in honor of my midnight rib dinner. I much prefer dozing off at hiker midnight.
I finally rouse myself, cook oatmeal, and go about morning tasks. It's after 9 by the time I hit the trail. My goal is 25 miles to Sarver Hollow Shelter, which will get me close enough to make it to Four Pines Hostel tomorrow. Usually a solid goal would be a motivation, but today I keep looking for outs. It's humid already, which is like kryptonite sapping my super hiking powers. The trail turns decidedly more difficult with multiple long, steep ascents and descents. My pinky toes have both developed blisters and my left ankle starts hurting halfway through the day for no apparent reason. That, plus there's several mile+ sections of rocks, rocks, rocks. It all conspires to bring my hiking speed to a relative crawl just when I really need reliable speed.
I pass a handful of hikers - a couple of southbound flip-floppers and a couple pairs of dayhikers. There's also a rare northbounder -  a woman named Rock n' Roll sectioning to Harpers Ferry starting from Pearisburg where she had to end her thruhike in June due to an ankle injury caused by her dog pulling on the leash. At my lunch stop at a shelter I also meet a dad and two adolescent boys out for the weekend. The boys are having a blast throwing acorns and moss at each other, and splashing around in the creek.
In late afternoon the trail descends through fields and deposits me at the Keffer Oak, a 300-year-old massive tree with enormous twisted limbs reaching in every direction. It would take three tall men to join hands around it's trunk. It sits in a distant corner of a forgotten field far from any road. But it gets thousands of visitors a year on foot.
As the afternoon turns to evening the miles tick by too slowly. There's yet another steep, long uphill to the ridge with my destination Sarver Hollow Shelter. Why are they all so steep today? Minimal switchbacks force me to shorten my steps and push on my poles. As I walk along the ridge the sun sets behind the mountains giving me a gorgeous view and projecting horizontal rays of gold on the trees. I walk more quickly - I hate hiking after dark. It takes far longer than it should to finish the last mile and the light is dim. Then, at last, I see the sign for a shelter and my heart sinks! It's four-tenths of a mile off trail. Downhill. On the dark side of the ridge. Cursing my poor planning I charge down. I would have grabbed one of those attractive tent sites along the ridge if I'd known it would be such a long way down to the shelter. Halfway down it's so dim I lose the trail as it seems to split. One way is runoff but I can't be sure which! I throw down the pack, frustrated, grab my emergency headlamp with the puny light output and search for blazes. I can barely identify the dark blue blazes of the trail and can see just enough to avoid a broken ankle as rocks pop up and the trail switches back several times. Finally I see another sign, this one for water - another half mile! But the sign is here because the shelter is also right here. I can get by with the water I brought. Let me just get to bed. The shelter is large with a full deck under a large overhang with picnic table. It probably gets little use being so far off trail and having for practical purposes no water. Only a desperate hiker would walk a mile roundtrip down a mountain for water.
I calm down and cook some potatoes and take stock of the day. At least I made my goal. Now I can rest my weary feet and settle my mind.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter

Low on water, I skip oatmeal for a sticky bun, then trudge back up to the ridgeline just after 8. On the way I see all the rocks I somehow sped over in near darkness, and the point where I nearly followed a runoff path to nowhere.
Barely a tenth of a mile along the AT I climb over some boulders and run into a rare northbounder. But this is no section hiker. She may be this season's very last northbound thruhiker. Pathfinder is 78 years young and started back in April. She hopes to make it to Harpers Ferry before winter sets in. I'd heard from Mongo how she tried to get to Garden Mountain Hostel to retrieve a package she'd had sent there but they didn't answer calls. So trail angel Gary took her to Bland to resupply, then to Lickskillet Hostel for the night, and back to the trail next day. Pathfinder tells me she stopped at the boulders last night because she would have had to take apart her pack to get over them. She ended up just sleeping there on the rocks. She is also low on water. I'd give her some of mine but I have even less. The next water is at Niday Shelter, six miles away. A full day's hike for Pathfinder. Reluctantly I hike ahead. There's not much I can do and she doesn't need my help if she's gotten this far, but my instinct is to hover and somehow help.
This ridge is very rocky and includes frequent stretches of angled bedrock. Great views, but hard to navigate. The valleys to the south are covered in clouds far below, like looking over a white sea with green islands. At the end of the ridge I come to the Eastern Continental Divide, separating watersheds for the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. It's 1920 miles by water to the Gulf, via the Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers. Also here is the 1500 mile marker for southbounders, a simple stick arrangement. They're almost three-quarters done. For northbounders this point is at the CT-MA border, with four states including the toughest terrain still to go.
The trail turns downward into another long, steep, mostly dirt, descent to a road. I pass Niday Shelter on the way down and the water source is poor, a trickling stream that takes several tries to fill a liter bottle. I make due with one liter since the next source is about seven miles away. 
Once past the road the trail heads straight up over 1500 feet. It's steep for a long while and I'm dripping sweat. The humidity is high once again. At the top is a cultivated mown strip along the trail with benches every half mile. Another trail leads in from below. A tourist trail maybe? The lovely path leads to the Audie Murphy monument, a simple tribute to the most decorated soldier of World War II. Stones are stacked on and around the subdued plaque with dog tags and other military memorabilia from people remembering their loved ones lost in battle. 
The ridge continues and once again becomes quite rocky, eventually yielding to another big, steep, dirt descent to another road. I've underestimated my water needs once again and I conserve what I have in case the next source is poor.
On the way down I pass a couple southbound flip-floppers. One is a middle-aged Asian woman from San Diego, a rare site on the trail. She's wilting in the humidity too, the one thing that's made Virginia a challenge for her after completing New Hampshire and Maine.
Hallelujah! There's a swiftly running creek at the road crossing. I camel down as much as I can drink and fill my two liters. I won't run dry again! I also splash and clean myself as best I can to cool off and hopefully control my burgeoning odor.
Once again the trail turns up for more than 1500 feet. It goes on and on. Once at ridgeline it continues to climb over rocks and bouldery knolls. There are more false summits than I can keep track of. My energy flags. There are occasional views of green and blue hills and sunny skies. Thunder rumbles nearby in various directions. To my delight clouds cover the sun for awhile and a breeze blows through, but no sign of rain. The terrain is dry, dusty and has a Southwestern feel with scraggly pines and woody shrubs hanging on in the rocky, sun-beaten soil. The occasional scampering lizard reinforces the image.
Finally cresting the top of the ridge, I encounter the first of many dayhikers. I soon reach Dragon's Tooth, a wall of pointed rocks reaching thirty or forty feet into the sky at the edge of a cliff. I consider climbing one but time and caution rule it out. As I descend I realize the destination isn't what draws the dayhikers but the journey. It's a two mile rock scramble with boulders and exposed bedrock at a riot of angles making for a fun if somewhat treacherous climb up or down. Most of the dayhikers are young couples or college kids out for the holiday weekend. But one thirty-something couple shepherding a clutch of teenagers has the dad carrying a young girl in a back carrier. He casually drinks a Gatorade on the other side as I tentatively cross a vertically-ridged bedrock bridge with a sheer drop-off. I tell him he's brave to attempt this with his cargo but he shrugs it off that he's done it before. 
This Maine-like descent fallen into central Virginia loses its charm after a half mile or so, but it keeps coming. I'm painfully aware of my poor pace today, for the third day in a row. Whether it's humidity, rough terrain, steep hills, dehydration, or just weariness I can't say, but it's very frustrating. Hitting this stretch feels like hitting the Whites and struggling to make miles. But this is not the Whites.
Finally the trail turns to dirt and falls steeply down to VA 624. Just then the skies that have been threatening for days finally open up and let out a good soaking sun shower. I'm able to throw my poncho on and keep dry (well, aside from the sweat). This road is my destination for the day, home of Joe Mitchell's Four Pines Hostel. It's a famous stop on the trail, at least partly for the shuttle it runs to The Homeplace, home to a reportedly amazing home-style (and huge) dinner.
I walk the half-mile down the country road to Joe's house and, seeing no one about, head around back to a freestanding garage that is the hostel. I let myself in. I'm the only one here, and it's already after six. There are a dozen bunks along with several couches, a fridge, stove and appliances, garage door openers, a bathroom and a shower. A shower! I make that my first priority. Then, still seeing no one around, I head to the front door of the house where Joe meets me after his own shower from mowing all day. He points me to the clothes washer around back (no dryer, just a line) and tells me I can take the van to the restaurant. 
I start the laundry and rev up the 1980s-vintage Ford van with roll-down windows and falling apart interior. It roars to life. I take it out on the main road and feel it struggle to get to 45. Fortunately The Homeplace is only a few miles away and the cars behind me don't get road rage. The restaurant is in an early 20th-century farm mansion. I immediately sense I'm out of place. The crowd is families in church clothes out for a Sunday brunch-style event. In fact it is Sunday, and a holiday at that. I get some stares on the way in. I can only wonder how a van-full of stinky thruhikers in prime season is greeted, but it is almost a de riguer stop on the trail regardless.
Because it's Sunday they stopped seating at six instead of eight. I'm crestfallen! My slow day has caught up with me again! The host, a young guy, takes pity and, seeing I'm a hiker, offers to make up a takeout platter with the works. I perk up immediately. Soon he's bringing out a bag full of styrofoam containers. I try to pay but he (and his boss) insist it's on the house. I start to press, but remember some sage advice: always let people help if they want to. Thanking him profusely I take my enormous heaping of trail magic calories back to the car and it roars back to life.
Stopping at the convenience store for iced teas I encounter several backpackers doing Virginia's triple crown (Dragon's Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs). I offer them a ride to the hostel but they are intent on hiking up to a campsite. Hey, we'll see how they'd feel if it was more than a three day trip. Anyway, I tried to do my good turn!
It's a little lonely in the big hostel this evening. Joe apparently keeps his distance, and it runs by donation. My clothes hang from meat hooks over the sofas as a floor fan air dries them. There's a 2017 Hiker Yearbook on the table, and as I flip through it I recognize far more faces and names than I would have guessed. My jumping up and down the trail has widened my exposure beyond the immediate vicinity a typical northbounder would know. I reflect on all the people I've met hundreds of miles and months, even a year, apart. It's a large community, but a small world.","Sarver Hollow Shelter
",Four Pines Hostel (VA 624),"Sep 02, Sun",22.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605814,"Having the Four Pines Hostel all to myself feels strange. I can imagine how crowded and rowdy it is in peak season. But I'm not complaining. It's a comfortable and quiet night's sleep. I'm awake as the sky lightens, in time to hear the rooster outside the garage begin to crow. There are a couple dozen chickens, ducks, and something that might be Guinea fowl milling around the garage 24/7. I have to avoid them as I pull the 1980s Aerostar van out for a breakfast run to the gas station. The van only has 80,000 miles on it but looks like it's been to the moon and back. 
Everything is now dry from last night's laundry, I have a lunch of leftover ham and biscuits from the Home Place, so I pack up and hike back to the trailhead. 
The trail winds through fields for two miles then over a low but rocky ridge to the McAfee Knob parking area. It's a sunny day, humid, and destined to be a barnburner. But it's also Labor Day, so the lot is jammed with cars parked in every place possible. This is one of the most accessible and spectacular views in Virginia so the crowds are no surprise. I pass dozens of dayhikers coming and going from the knob, which is four miles out over relatively good trail with occasional bedrock. There's a better graded fire road alternative for the less intrepid hikers. 
McAfee Knob lives up to its reputation, with long sweeping 180° views. The bedrock ledges jut out 10 or more feet over air, making for those iconic photographs. One of my niggling concerns during those long days seeing almost no one on the trail was being the only one up here and having no one to take my picture. No way to get a McAfee Knob selfie without a 30 foot arm! Labor Day negates that concern. A friendly dayhiker gets artistic and has me posing for a dozen different shots. Alongside Katahdin, Springer, and Harpers Ferry, McAfee Knob completes my AT must-have photo set!
I'd love to say that I leave McAfee Knob on a high and float along the rest of the day, but that doesn't happen. Already ten miles in, the next sixteen miles past the equally beautiful Tinker Cliffs and over to Daleville are more like a death march. Humidity and hot sun are not a hiker's friends. Constant ups and downs and rocky ridges aren't either. And near total absence of water for twenty miles definitely is not. The one source is a stream bed with little more than puddles that need to be scooped out. It's enough to get me through, but I am effectively dehydrated most of the day, and as a result in a pretty bad mood. I've been disappointed in my pace most of this trip, but today seems particularly off. I start a downhill that I'm sure maps to a certain point on the elevation profile based on how long I've been hiking, but then I reach a landmark that I think I should have passed two miles ago! Each mile is a battle to keep myself motivated. The lack of water and campsites is the stick; my car in Daleville is the carrot. At one point I am aware of passing a beautiful hidden lake below the ridge with the sun setting over the mountains behind it, but I'm in no mood to appreciate the view. Instead the impending darkness spurs me on. 
After a seeming eternity the ridge relents and releases me into the forest below. In relatively short order I'm at route 220 in Daleville with end-of-holiday-weekend traffic screaming past. Dutifully I cross the road to link up this section with the one I started in Daleville back in June. Then I visit the gas station next door for some nectar of the gods. 
My car is mercifully unmolested in the Valley Cleaners parking lot. After a change, a washroom splashdown, and a burger dinner I begin to feel human again. It's 360 miles home up I-81 and I doubt I'll make it tonight after such a long day. But once on the road I enter a state of sustained attention and unusual lucidity. Things seem very clear and very simple. I feel no need to stop or even break. As far as I know no chemicals are involved. Five hours later I'm back home and about five minutes after I'm asleep in bed.","Four Pines Hostel (VA 624)
",Daleville (US 220),"Sep 03, Mon",25.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605815,"It's time to knock out my final section in Virginia. Back in June my daughter Snickers and I headed south through Shenandoah National Park and stopped at Black Rock Gap, twenty miles north of the park's southern end at Rockfish Gap. When I went back later in June I headed north from Daleville, 140 miles south of Black Rock Gap, intending to link up the sections. But humidity and rain slowed me down and I stopped at Reeds Gap, almost twenty miles south of Rockfish Gap. So a forty mile section remains. I plan to finish it in two days, heading south so I don't need to pay to drive into the park and leave my car.
The forecast is for gorgeous hiking weather - cool and clear. But that's a blessing and a curse. The one shuttle driver available in the area is insanely busy with hikers taking advantage of the fine weather. To fit into his schedule I end up leaving my home near Philadelphia at three in the morning for an 8am pickup at Reeds Gap. It's dark for the first four hours of the drive, then around seven I can see the dim golden silhouette of the Shenandoah ridge to my right as I whiz down I-81.
I'm early, and a hiker wanders into the small lot at Reeds Gap as I pull out the pack. Adam ""Stanimal"" Stanley, the shuttler, pulls up minutes later to pick us both up. The other hiker, Daniel, has been out for six days coming north from the James River. He tells us he hasn't worn his hearing aid the whole time. At this time of year, there's few enough folks around it probably never mattered.
Adam drops Daniel off in Waynesboro and we head up Skyline Drive. Adam also owns two hiker hostels and a number of long-term rental homes/trailers, and rents rooms on AirBnB. That and shuttling keep him extremely busy. Constant staff turnover makes it difficult. And now Virginia is hassling him and all the other shuttle drivers in the state to register as cab drivers, a move probably instigated by a local cab company. If the state continues, it will likely drive most of those shuttlers to stop offering rides. Uber, meanwhile, is untouched. 
Adam seems to know every ranger in the park, a necessity to make for smooth entry and transit through the lengthy park. Newbie rangers sometimes give his drivers a hard time until they understand that they are helping hikers. In fact rangers often call the shuttlers when they find an injured hiker rather than do all the paperwork required to give them a ride in the ranger vehicle.
Anyway, off I go from Black Rock Gap. It was close to freezing this morning but is headed into the 50s. The low humidity is amazing! I feel strong and energized. The terrain is smooth and grades are relatively easy. Few views, but the forest is green and alive without the oppressive heat of summer. I find myself dashing down the trail. By noon, three hours in, I've gone almost 11 miles. This may be a personal record.
I stop at a power line cut near Jarman Gap to eat lunch and soak up the warm sun. There's a hazy view into the Shenandoah valley to the west showing farms and clusters of homes with blue mountains beyond. Lunch is half of a chicken salad hoagie I picked up on the drive down. Section hiking does have its advantages!
Climbing north out of Beagle Gap up to Bear Den mountain I hear barking down below from the parking area. Sure sounds like beagles! Fortunately no bear growls from the other direction. Bear Den mountain is capped with numerous communications towers. Off to one side of the trail is a fire circle with tractor seats planted in the ground as chairs. One of the many quirky sights along the AT.
As I cross Little Calf Mountain with beautiful views from the grassy summit, I begin to feel the miles. Seems early to be wearing down, and I realize I'm dehydrated. Even on a cool day it can sneak up on you. Water and snacks set me right again. 
The trail becomes rockier south of Little Calf and there are some steep climbs. But generally the trail descends to Rockfish Gap. Here I cross I-64 and Skyline Drive becomes the Blue Ridge Parkway. There's a street vendor called King Popcorn nearby where I grab a hot dog and soda. Not in the mood for popcorn after twenty miles of hiking.
Onward south, where the trail is quite nice for the five miles to the Paul Wolfe Shelter. There are a number of swiftly flowing streams and springs with many cascades. There are also a number of enormous downed trees across the trail, some with a jungle of branches to twist through. Someone from the Old Dominion Trail Club needs to bring out a chainsaw (or three). What there is not much of are tent sites, so I'm glad I have plenty of time to get to the shelter. 
A few minutes after passing the ruins of an old stone cabin, I hear loud rustling uphill. Suddenly a bear cub clambors down a tree and runs off. As he's running a second one descends another tree, hits the ground, and follows. Then a third starts down, swinging around the trunk by his arms like a monkey! I'm too slow to get pictures. Then a fourth tree starts to rustle. A larger bear starts down and stops, listening. I bang my sticks so it knows where I am. It moves a little, but decides to remain in the tree, so I move on, having gotten a bit of grainy video. I'd heard this stretch south of Rockfish was known for bear sightings. This is the largest group of bears I've ever seen. This makes nine I've seen along the trail in five instances - two in Vermont, one in Wind Gap, PA, one each on two occasions in Shenandoah, and now this family of four. And I haven't been to Bear Central - the Smokies - yet.
A short time later I pass an old family cemetery, a remnant of mountain life before the park pushed out the residents. Most of the simple stone markers are so weathered the markings have disappeared, but one is very clear. ""M C"" and underneath that ""LOWE"" and underneath that a faded name. I read it as a misspelling of ""Love"" from a mourning spouse.
I finally reach the Wolfe Shelter around 5:30. I am the only one here. It has a covered deck with picnic table and two-level sleeping. There's a roaring stream fifty yards away. As I collect water a hiker named Joe comes up from the south. He's been out eight weeks, starting down near the Smokies. Seems like a nice guy, but hard to understand. He sets up his hammock away from the shelter but comes up to chat for a bit before dark. Night falls far earlier than I'm used to on the trail, but I take advantage of the opportunity for extra sleep. It's a very quiet night.","Black Rock Gap
",Paul C Wolfe Shelter,"Oct 19, Fri",25
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605817,"It's not as chilly this morning as I expected. A few leg raises and push-ups warm me up enough to change clothes and start breakfast comfortably. Joe comes over to offer his extra container of fuel since mine ran empty making noodles last night. Very much appreciated. I bring over my excess food in return since I'm walking out today. He has ten(!) days of food already but takes almost all of it eagerly anyway. I return the fuel gratefully, after using it to cook some oatmeal. 
The trail to Reeds Gap heads up a long ascent to a popular day hiking area called Humpback Rocks. While the Wolfe shelter had a wonderful rushing creek, there is little water in this section to the south. There are, however, as with yesterday, a number of enormous blowdowns that require acrobatics to maneuver through the leafy canopies. But almost as soon as I wonder when the trail maintainers will be out I stumble upon a crew from the Old Dominion AT Club out of Richmond. They've given up their Saturday to work on the trail. I tease that I hope they have a chainsaw and a volunteer hollers back ""We got three!"" And they do, as I meet the other two crews further south. I catch the last crew in the middle of cutting through a massive blowdown. After thanking them profusely I have the honor of being the first through the cut. 
The final few miles parallel the Blue Ridge Parkway, out of earshot, and pass along some cliffs with great views over the Shenandoah valley to the west. This is the Three Ridges Wilderness, another popular area for dayhikes and backpacking. A number of people are out and about on this beautiful fall weekend. The leaves are just beginning to turn, but from across the valley it is already a riot of color.
Too soon I reach Reeds Gap (or Reids, the signs aren't consistent) and the end of my section. I tread over the trailhead I exited in June. Then, I was coming north from Daleville to catch a shuttle that ended up taking me on a fortuitous detour to Devil's Backbone Brewery. Today my own car is waiting, none the worse for the wait but definitely enjoying more company on a Saturday afternoon than early on a Friday morning. I drive down the winding mountain roads into Waynesboro and hit the Tailgate Grill for another best-of-the-Shenandoah-Valley hamburger. Last time I was here in June my daughter Snickers and I were celebrating the end of our six-day Shenandoah hike. The burger is still delicious, but I miss the company.
Another four-plus-hour drive home, fortunately uneventful. This section effectively completes Virginia, save for a few miles south of Damascus. It's taken all season and six trips, but my state count increases to 11 and completion rate hits 80%, a little over 1750 miles. Not that I'm counting!
Thruhikers are glad to be done with the never-ending state of Virginia, fully one-quarter of the entire AT, or they joke that they were told it was flat. In all those trips, though, I never really focused on it being one state, let alone uniform. There was the majesty and comforts of Shenandoah; the exurban Roller Coaster and rocky ridges to the north; the imposing climbs and relative isolation of the central Virginia blue ridge; the stark open peaks of Grayson Highlands; the ridges and valleys and abundant hostels from Atkins through Pearisburg; and Virginia's Triple Crown in the center. The weather played a major role in my perception of each region. One day I would like to hike the central blue ridge in a drier and less humid fall excursion. But the people and towns were almost always friendly and welcoming. Most of all I enjoyed being able to share some of this beauty and adventure with my children. I hope that it stays with them, and they remember it fondly long after I am unable to accompany them on their own adventures, as I fondly remember the trips I took with my own father.","Paul C Wolfe Shelter
",Reeds Gap,"Oct 20, Sat",14.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608688,"I left the house outside Philly at 3 this morning and drove to Georgia to start my last leg of the AT - Springer to Damascus. Seventeen hours later I am five miles up the Approach Trail camped on the summit of Frosty Mountain, sipping hot tea as the fire burns down to coals.
I left the car in the Damascus area (in the Virginia panhandle) and drove a rental down to Dawsonville, Georgia. Bret ""Suches"" Eady (AT '17) met me there for the final hop to Amicalola Falls State Park. I drove over the AT three times on the way down: in Carlisle PA, Atkins VA, and Sams Gap TN/NC. On the last crossing, the snow-covered Roan Highlands and Unaka range towered in the distance, as impressive as anything in the White Mountains. Looking forward to seeing them up close!
Spring has sprung at lower elevations here. The forsythia and pear are in full bloom, people are mowing their lawns, and violets dot the lower reaches of Amicalola Falls. But higher up it is still and quiet, the silence of winter.
At the Amicalola visitor's center I weigh my pack and it comes in at 26-27 pounds with two liters of water and four days of food. Not bad for winter outfitting. A Georgia AT Club volunteer assigns me tag number 1384. Slightly fewer hikers than last year on this date, but still some 4500 thruhikers are expected. Bret told me he's shuttled a number of repeat thruhikers this year. It's past five when I walk in and when I say I'm headed immediately up Springer to the first shelter, Black Gap, seven miles up, the volunteer warns me about a bear sighting there. 
Undeterred, I head out to the arch that starts the Approach Trail. A young guy named Andrew and his dad are thruhiking together and take my picture. They'll shuttle to Springer tomorrow so I may see them again. I start out with an ex-military mother leading her young son and daughter on a backpacking trip to the top of Springer. It's practice, she says, for a family thruhike between high school and college. 
Climbing the steep path to the falls I stop to chat with Emmy. A self-described ""flatlander"" from the Outer Banks, she's regretting not quitting smoking before her thruhike. I assure her this is the toughest stretch of the Approach Trail. Plenty of time to get her hiker legs. One step at a time. ""And a lot of breaks!"" she exclaims.
It's a gorgeous, clear day approaching 70 degrees. Too hot, in fact, and I'm sweating climbing the falls. They are beautiful and impressive. And very popular on this sunny Saturday. Eventually I leave the crowds behind as I continue past the lodge. It's perfectly quiet except for my own shuffling. Blue mountains shimmer in the West and the sun dips low in the sky.
I pass several enticing tent sites on minor summits. But there's still daylight. I can make the shelter. Surmounting Frosty Mountain, there's a couple setting up a tent next to a lovely view. My mind churns it over. A half mile later, at the second Frosty summit, there are several more perfect sites with fire rings and views. I debate with myself. I turn to head forward  Why am I pushing on?  This is a perfect spot. And quiet. And time to relax and get chores done before dark. Why am I out here if I won't take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves? I stop, and turn back to the tent site. I'm quietly proud of myself, and surprised, for not being a stubborn fool. Maybe I'll go easier on myself this hike.
Since it's clear, I leave the fly off the tent to see the stars. And to experiment with the benefit of the fly at 40 degrees. There's a fire ring, and some wonderful soul has collected piles of dry wood. I quickly have a small bonfire going. Unfortunately some other soul has left copious litter about the site, so I fill up my trash bag to carry it out. Back at the visitor center another trail volunteer, Master Splinter, had come in with a bag of trash he had just collected from the Approach Trail. Leave No Trace is still a theory to many people.
With the fire going I treat myself to a Subway tuna hoagie, knowing I wouldn't want to cook after such a long day. Then, with some hot tea and a dying fire I journal and gaze up at the stars, thinking about my family and what tomorrow will bring.",,Frosty Mountain summit,"Mar 23, Sat",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608788,"Great weather for my first full day on the trail, and a host of unique characters to enliven the hike. 
The rising sun wakes me up on Frosty Mountain. I'd heard footsteps walking by the tent at 4am, but it must have been a raccoon. Other than it was silent all night. Hardly even a breeze to break the stillness.  The sunrise is diffused by clouds on the horizon. It forms a spreading column of pinks, purples, yellows, and oranges.
I slept well, despite the chill 40 degree night. My foam pad and the piece of reflectix I cut to fit under it were very insulating and comfortable. Pulling out the reflectix, it felt warm on top and cold underneath. 
I pack up and plan to stop at the next shelter to make breakfast. But first I pay it forward by gathering firewood for the next camper. A few birds are chirping as I head toward Black Mountain, and I spy a few isolated violets.
At Black Gap Shelter everyone's packing up while I stop to make oatmeal at the picnic table. I meet Bret, a graying guy in a cotton T-shirt, who is adjusting to the mountains after hiking the sandy and flat Florida Trail near his home. The other shelter-dweller, Emma, is a young girl already thinking of quitting her thru hike due to the difficulty of the Approach Trail, and maybe getting off at Springer mountain. I try to encourage her but she seems overwhelmed. A good rule of thumb is never quit on a bad day. Or two. Wait a week and if it's still terrible then you gave it your best.
As I exit a runner passes the shelter. At the summit of Springer I catch him. He's an ultrarunner training for a 50K by running the Approach Trail. I get my Springer photo and chat with a dayhiking couple. On the way down the north side I meet a mom starting her thruhike. Her ten year-old daughter is accompanying her up Springer from the parking lot and her parents are standing at the car below.
Another mile on I find Enoch cooling his heal in a stream. He's got plantar fasciitis. He hiked 1500 miles of the trail four years ago and is back to try again. He is 80 years old. He plans to hike 15 miles a day, 5 days a week, and spend weekends with his wife who's following in a camper. From his demeanor, I think he will do it. His name comes from the Old Testament story of the man who walked with God and ascended into heaven. I tell him climbing Katahdin will feel a little like that and he smiles.
Further on a middle-aged Asian woman named Ladybug is lunching by a spring. She's nervous about crowded shelters and plans to try a less popular tentsite with a more intimate crowd.
At Stover Creek Shelter someone's napping in a hammock. I chat with Prospector, a 44-year-old ice fisher and You-Tuber from Wyoming out for a month until his daughter's high school graduation. The hammock stirs and a young bearded guy from Nebraska named Ket (after ketamine) pops out. He's just ambling around a free miles a day and heading home in a week. 
I head on to Three Forks. Just beyond I catch a plodding hiker who goes by Moon. He's from the Virginia Blue Ridge and does not consider himself a hiker or even a lover of the outdoors.  He had one knee replaced recently and is ready to do the other one. But hiking the AT is his dream and he is living it.
I feel like I've lost the trail a bit later. No blazes in sight for a while. After scrambling with maps I can't figure it out. Then a minute later I round a bend and I realize all is well when a sign for Long Creek Falls appears. It's a pretty fall whose main drop is about twenty feet but has many more minor cascades. A rock nearby has grafitti carved into it dating back to 1877.
Climbing towards Cemetery Flats I run into Matt, a strong-looking guy with gray and white stubble who complains about his 65-pound pack. He's only managed a few miles a day with this behemoth. He can't wait to get to a post office to send home his 20-pound laptop and his bear canister. Also his phone is dead and he has no map or guide. I tell him where the shelter is and the next road crossing. I guess it's a lesson hard-won in his case 
At Hawk Mountain Shelter I stop for water and wander through a tent city. There must be two dozen tents and it's only 3pm. These are the people who got dropped off at Springer this morning and walked eight miles here. They are all adapting to tent life and the routine chores of camping. Some seem a little flummoxed by their equipment. No one is staying in the shelter. But I chat with a guy named Green Slouch wearing a long green knit cap. There are four dogs wandering around as well, including a huge gray mastiff named Leyla carrying what looks like twenty pounds of dog food in a harness. She belongs to a 1999 thruhiker named Hyper Heidi. 
I head on, looking to make Justus Creek where there are tent sites and water but hopefully no crowds. But it's another six miles and I have to summit Sassafras and Justus mountains first. I've eaten all my snacks and try to force down water, but I have to drag myself up the steep climbs. I run into Rabid Raccoon taking water out of a very shallow spring. He's a middle-aged guy from Texas whose kids gave him the name. And his wife gave him a cap with a raccoon on it for emphasis.
The tough Sassafras climb almost has me stopping at one of the summit tentsites, but once on top I feel better and walk down to Justus Creek, finishing an 18-mile day, 14 of which are officially on the AT. At the creek I tent near two thruhikers on a ledge where we can listen to the rushing waters. We build a fire, cook noodles, and chat for a few hours about everything from trail life to Wittgenstein. Frog is an eclectic guy fascinated with Eastern religions and prone to offbeat and disconnected remarks. He seems to need a girlfriend, something he keeps alluding to. Alex is young and has hiked the first few hundred miles of the AT with a group before. But this time he wants to do it all and make it his own hike. His girlfriend is at home and he won't see her until New Jersey, four months from now. He's a mere 120 pounds and concerned about shrinking below the 104 he hit on his last hike when he got the name Lightweight.
It's supposed to rain tonight and tomorrow, but it feels a bit warmer this evening. It was a little too warm this afternoon. I was grateful for the cool mountain breezes and what shade the leafless trees could provide.
Update: Rain held off. No service at Justus Creek so posting from Ramrock Mountain.","Frosty Mountain summit

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608862,"Met more characters and climbed over Blood Mountain in the rain today. Weary, wet and hungry, we found a little respite from the trail...
I'm slow to wake up, sunlight struggling to reach our little valley at Justus Creek. Frog is already packing up and takes off while I'm making oatmeal. Alex sleeps in a bit. When he joins me at the fire/breakfast circle I suggest a trail name for him: ""Sinatra"", because this time he wants to hike the trail ""My Way!"" He thinks it's a keeper. Much better than Lightweight, or his other trail name, from when his girlfriend got a black eye walking into a branch: ""Wifebeater""!
I hike up to Gooch Mountain shelter. Only three people left: Katie, a ridgerunner and AT/PCT hiker, Polar Bear, a middle-aged guy who carries a stuffed bear holding a Coca-Cola, and Chopsticks, a cross-eyed kid who thrued in 2016. Katie is talking about a sugar glider who entertained/terrorized the 16 shelter occupants by flying around and attacking their packs for much of the evening. Apparently they were also entertained by a burly hiker who became very disconcerted when a mouse fell on him.
Chopsticks is zeroing today. The hammock he says he's hiked 8000 miles with is still rigged up. He heard it's going to rain, so he's staying put. Now, experienced hikers are not exactly put off by routine rain showers, so he sets off my alarm bells. I learn from his shelter mates later at Neel Gap he was a bit creepy if harmless during their stay. 
I climb over Ramrock mountain, taking advantage of cell service to post yesterday's entry. Ironheart comes by, hiking a small section with his fellow heart attack survivor Triple A. Ironheart did half the trail in 2017, but the opposite half I did. He snaps my picture for his blog and tips me to the best hostels between here and Damascus. 
At Woody Gap a major highway passes through. While I dump my trash, mostly collected from the first night's campsite, two older guys drive up in a truck to take in the view. One looks like Uncle Jesse from Dukes of Hazzard. They pepper me with questions when I say I'm hiking to Virginia to finish the trail, then look at a kiosk showing the whole AT and say ""Damn, boy, you must've already done a thousand miles!"" Well, more like 1700. Duly impressed, they laugh and wish me good luck.
It showers off and on from 10am. By mid-afternoon it's a steady soaking rain. Hikers are stopping at Lance Creek or Jarrards Gap to avoid climbing Blood Mountain, Georgia's tallest, in the rain. I plod on. Mist drifts into the valleys and obscures the view. But my rain hood acts like blinders anyway.
The climb up is not bad. Sassafras was harder. Maybe my lungs are adapting, or the rain helps. At the summit is a stone shelter. Inside ten people are crowded, some setting up for the night, and some gathered around a rastafarian-looking dude brewing something in a pot. ""Hot cocoa?"" he offers. I thought it was something else. The scene is a little surreal and I don't linger. Later I find out this rasta dude has been living off of the hiker box at Mountain Crossings and basically set up shop on Blood Mountain. Apparently came out to Springer really unprepared, burnt down his tent cooking in it, and got some donated equipment. The weird vibe I picked up was definitely warranted.
The climb down Blood is wet and slippery, first over steep bedrock, then down boulders with slick mud in between. It reminds me of Maine. Which actually makes it fun. I only slip a few times but I'm a wet mess by the time I reach the road.
I cross route 19 with Peter ""Grisu"" from Bern, Switzerland, who's out for a few weeks to test a thruhike when he retires in a few years. His grandkids named him after a little cartoon green dragon on Swiss television. I get a pizza at Mountain Crossings, but their bunkroom is already full. Peter is up for splitting a cabin nearby, but they are all full or overpriced. Finally I find Your Home in the Woods B&B in Guthook (an AT guide app).
The proprietors Paul and Bonnie come and pick us up in their truck and drive us 15 minutes to the next valley where their home is perched on a hill. We shower and they give us scrubs to wear while they do our laundry. They even invite us to dine with them. And breakfast in the morning of course. For 45 bucks it's a better deal than any other place in Georgia. They've been operating for 17 years but started taking in hikers 3 years ago when they realized after meeting some that we aren't all Bear Grylls and don't necessarily want to tent every night. Some hiker guests stay 3, 4, even 8 nights and slackpack across Georgia.
Another hiker here is Brantley, a surfer dude-type scuba instructor with sun-bleached hair from Florida who works on high-voltage transmission towers, dropping out of helicopters on to live wires. Apparently the pay is good and jobs are hard to fill. Go figure! He's taking a zero after staying at Mountain Crossings' bunkhouse last night (they kick you out after one night).
I call my family after dinner and hear about their weekend scout trip and the Lego 2 movie. So good to hear everyone's voices. I really miss them. I wish Georgia was close enough to hike a few days and return home. This is the farthest section. At least I am walking north - towards home.","Justus Creek

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608936,"A four-star breakfast, double trail magic and a soggy end to the day. 
I wake up several times in the so-soft and warm bed at Your Home in the Woods B&B. The sun doesn't rise til after 7 so I've no idea what time it is. Finally I get up and it's 6am. Grisu and Brantley are soon up as well. Looks like Brantley may take his old nickname of Bluntley, which you can work out for yourself! I work idly and futilely on a 1500-piece crossword puzzle Paul and Bonnie's grandchildren gave them (not sure they like their grandparents?) while they whip up a gourmet breakfast for us. Poached eggs with dill and feta, lemon ricotta pancakes, sausages, and homemade scones. One of the fanciest and tastiest breakfasts I've ever had, let alone on the trail! Paul was a teacher and principal of a private school in Atlanta for 44 years. He's a Virginia native while Bonnie's from Maine, but both decided the mild winters of North Georgia were a better place to open their B&B than the short season in Maine.
Paul drops us back at Neel Gap and hands out leftover scones to hikers. I buy new trekking pole tips at Mountain Crossings and spend the next half hour banging, wrenching, and pulling the old tips off. Grisu points out they have hot water in the outfitters and once I soak the more stubborn one I get both tips off. They have 1100 miles on them - I got them in Killington so they have 500 miles from there to Katahdin, all of Virginia, and more. The carbide tips disappeared long ago, and the hard plastic shafts are worn down to nubs. I can immediately feel the difference in how the new ones bite the ground. An important repair considering how many times these poles have saved my butt.
I bump into my shuttle guy Bret Eady on the way out the door. He seems to be everywhere in North Georgia all the time. I start to rave about Paul and Bonnie but he's already a convert and gives out their card all the time.
The six mile hike to Tesnatee Gap is fogbound. I'm sure Levelland Mountain, Wolf Laurel Top, and Cowrock Mountain have wonderful views but this morning I get to focus on the twenty yards of trees, leaves, and duff nearest the trail. I pass Papa Bear, a 72-year-old who's fallen way behind his two teenage grandchildren. This is their second annual section hike and they are headed for the North Carolina border.  
Down in the gap I find a trail magic spread hosted by an Atlanta Baptist church. King Tut and Georgia Duck are handing out coffee, hot chocolate, donuts, soda and more. But the best part is the chairs. The sun comes out to warm us up. And I'm given a handmade knit cap with a white blaze on the side courtesy of the church's crochet club. Thank you ladies! It's very warm!
A dozen or so hikers appear while I'm there. Very popular is a massage roller which three twenty-something guys - Joe, Nikita, and a large bearded fellow from Austin - use to tenderize their painful knee, IT band, and ankle. I feel less old seeing these young guys laid low, and lucky I have no chronic pain to deal with. Other than sore feet thanks to my aging shoes.
It takes a great effort to separate myself from my chair, but eventually I climb over Wildcat Mountain. Less than a mile later at Hogpen Gap there's another trail magic spread!
Four guys from a Bible study group - Bobby, Steven, Danny and Philip (I probably got three of those names correct) have minestrone soup (with fresh possum they joke), pasta salad, hard-boiled eggs, hot tea, soda, and more. I'm glad I only nibbled at the last one because the soup and pasta salad are delicious!
Sadly every day will not be such a rolling feast, and I reluctantly take my leave again. The sun has come out as I make my way over gentle terrain to Low Gap. Here virtually everyone from Neel Gap, including all my fellow trail magic guests, are stopping and there are about twenty people gathered in the shelter and the picnic table next to it. I take a restroom break and move on after chatting with a forty-something guy named ZigZag.
A steady rain falls over the seven miles to Blue Mountain shelter. I have to christen my rain mitts and don my already tattered poncho to avoid a soaking from the relentless shower. It'll be in the thirties tonight so staying dry is paramount. I meet an Asian family of four along the way who are nearing the end of a fifty mile section from Springer. I ask how it's been and the mom smiles and says ""Well, we haven't killed each other yet!"" Still, they seem in good spirits considering the weather and how long they've been out.
The rain continues without pause. The last couple miles are very rocky and slick with mud along a steep sidehill.
Finally I spy the shelter high on a hill through the fog, like a scene out of a Steven King novel. There's only one tent pitched so my hopes of getting a dry shelter spot rise, but are quickly dashed when I stumble into eight shelter-dwellers lounging about under the roof. Oh well! I ""dry-pitch"" the tent, putting the rainfly on first then hooking the inner tent onto the pole skeleton underneath to keep it dry. I head to the shelter cover to make hot tea and a noodle dinner with roasted-tomato-flavored tuna thrown in. 
There are four section hikers from Ohio. They need to get off early at the road two miles away because one of them has gotten sick. Another of them has a flask of homemade moonshine (I guess that's redundant). The other four are thruhikers. One did 1700 miles of the AT in 2016 and is back to try again, from the beginning of course! Another, Unicef, is an occasional peakbagger and literacy teacher from Boulder. He got his name by accepting food donations from everyone, and worries it might be offensive. No, I've heard some offensive trail names and that ain't one of them! He started the Approach Trail two hours before me so we seem to have a similar pace. The first such person I've run into.
I retire early to the tent after hanging my food bag in the rain. The bear cables are hopelessly jerry-rigged so I use my own line to hoist it up a tree.

",Blue Mountain shelter,"Mar 26, Tue",18.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608999,"A day to dry out and tackle Georgia's toughest climbs.
I wake up in a soggy tent with a wet floor. Probably from pitching on wet grass, which I thought would be soft and insulating. Oh well! Into the sack it all goes, I'll dry it out later.
Breakfast at the shelter with the four section hikers and Unicef, Clammy, who's done the PCT and CDT and going for his Triple Crown, Brian, who's hiked in Peru and Vietnam, Mud Turkey, and Dirty Girl with his hot pink sparkly gaiters. Dirty Girl hiked 1700 miles to Killington in '17 and ran out of money.
Packing is tricky, separating the wet gear from the dry. I try to keep the puffy, sleeping bag, and sleeping clothes dry at all costs. Finally I head over Blue Mountain with temperatures in the thirties and down to Unicoi Gap.
Hikers are coming back from Hiawassee at Unicoi, having skipped into town to avoid the rain. A lady is sitting in her truck seeing if anyone needs a ride into town. 
The elevation profile looks like a zigzag with sharp peaks and valleys. I climb over Rocky Mountain, true to it's name, and 1300 feet up Tray Mountain. A half dozen or more thru and section hikers are slowly making their way up. Kayla is back on trail after two weeks, recovering from a fall coming down Blue in an ice storm.
I stop at Tray Mountain shelter for lunch with Clammy, Unicef, and Brian. We try to name Brian Casanova since he was spotted with two beautiful women and drinking champagne at the beginning of the Approach Trail. He doesn't take to it. Some of my stuff dries in the now warm sun. 
In the afternoon I hike with Chris, who popped on at Unicoi. A Virginia boy who works on historical millwork in Charleston now, his boss immediately agreed to him taking six months off, telling him to go have an adventure while he's young. 
He also tells me a little about the rastafarian guy at Blood Mountain. He's called Quartz after his necklaces, sold his home in Atlanta and started living on the street doing Tarot readings before deciding to hike the AT. He stopped at Blood and apparently helps by maintaining the privy. He lives off donated food and the hiker box.
Kelly Knob is the last climb before Deep Gap shelter and it is a long, steep one. Tougher than Tray Mountain. Several tents are set up around Deep Gap shelter and people milling in front of the building. But there is still plenty of room so I nab a spot in the second floor loft.
I lay out the tent to dry in the late afternoon sun while Wishbone starts a fire. Also here is Woodpile from San Luis Obispo, California, who fell asleep quickly to earn his name. And Poptart, whose name I remember because he thrued in '17 when I was doing the northern half, and has hiked the Florida Trail and much of the AT every year since, including Springer to central Virginia just this winter.
I hang out for a few hours around the fire shooting the breeze. Tomorrow four of us will go into Hiawassee at the next road crossing for a night off the trail.","Blue Mountain shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609059,"A low-mileage ""Nero"" day into town to rest and load up on calories.
I tossed and turned last night in the shelter. My lower back doesn't like the lack of support from my foam pad. I should probably stick to tenting on soft ground. It was in the thirties again but I'm warm in my bag. 
Finally I get up at 7:15 and pack in a hurry to hike four miles to Dick's Creek Gap to catch a 9:15 shuttle to Hiawassee. We arrive a little early since it's almost all downhill but cool our heels for an hour waiting for the delayed shuttle. Vagabond, a 76-year-old lady who thruhiked in 1994 and 2013, is waiting to take people to the Top of Georgia hostel just up the road, but we are set on staying in town, ten miles away. Vagabond is thinking of thruhiking again when she turns 80!
The Budget Inn shuttle eventually arrives and drives us to Hiawassee. Clammy, Unicef, Brian and I split a room. $15 is a much better deal than a bunk at Top of Georgia for 35. And we have the run of town. We start with breakfast at the Main Street Diner next door that just opened Saturday. Thirty minutes later four plates are cleaned of every last crumb.
Brian hikes fast and eats faster, so he is now Fast Lane. Which fits with the champagne and girls sending him off at Amicalola. He's a low-key and quiet thirty-something Atlanta native, so it's a little ironic as well.
We resupply at Ingles, losing Clammy in the process, and run into many other hikers. Frog passes by. He is now known as ""Air Quotes"" for, I guess, the obvious reason. Another guy, Early Bird, is nursing an ankle outside the market and hiking with a middle-aged guy named Radagast after a Tolkein wizard. More are circulating but I can't keep them all straight. A reddish-gray-haired guy named Missing Person is at the motel. He's working on completing the trail for a fourth(!) time. He says he's getting a little bored since he knows every rock. Why don't you try the PCT? ""Did it last year!"" he replies.
Back at the hotel we find Clammy, then shower and do laundry while watching brainless 80s movies like Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Revenge of the Nerds on an appropriately old cathode-ray-tube TV. A young kid in a Jamaican knit cap asks if we've seen his misplaced pouch with cash and phone and seems pretty frantic.
By 4 we're hungry again and walk a mile or so to the Mexican restaurant Monte Alban where I finish off the Hombre Grande, an enormous combination platter, plus a quart-sized Dos Equis. My hiking buddies are impressed. The walk back helps it settle. 
Back at the motel Jamaican-hat kid has found his valuables - in his room - and is headed off to the Mexican joint with a friend. The motel is full and several hikers are tenting on a grassy area by the parking lot. There is only one car in the lot, and it belongs to the motel.

Back to the Main Street Diner for breakfast - our new home base.  There are numbers on the tables now, and the waitress remembers our order. 
I haven't said too much about UNICEF, aka Neil. He grew up in small-town Texas, half-Mexican, spent two and half years in Madagascar with the Peace Corps, and now lives in Boulder. He loves rock climbing, speaks Malagasy and Spanish, and runs ESL programs for the Boulder public library.
Fast Lane runs the Sophisticated Caveman blog which promotes a Paleo diet.
Seems like everyone at the Budget Inn wants to take the first shuttle back to the trail. I don't recall hikers being so eager for an early start farther north! We end up squeezing14 hikers in the van - tying the record. With all the backpacks it's an impressive feat. Among the passengers is s 38-year-old woman named Grit and a sixtyish guy named Apostle after his real name Paul.
We drop people at Unicoi Gap first including Alex aka Sinatra who I camped with back at Justus Creek.
At Dick's Creek Gap 9 of us pile out and start up the steep climb with our packs heavy from resupply. Clammy falls back, nursing his knee, while Fast Lane disappears ahead. UNICEF and I hike together for much of the day. We pass a short-haired girl named Chris who is trained in wilderness skills and plant identification and led student backpacking trips in the Adirondacks. She's known for starting fires with a bowdrill. None of the names we throw out are you guys her liking.
We come upon Clammy sitting in the trail stretching out his knee. He took a bad step and the IT band flared up.  But he wants to keep pace with us and pushes on despite our concern.
I bump into Grisu the Swiss hiker again, and get introduced to Pine Needle. He's a young blonde bearded and tan kid hiking barefoot and typically shirtless who has traveled extensively and knows his way around wild flora. His name comes from the pine needles he uses to brew tea.
The hiking is almost all uphill today with long, often steep, climbs. But the tread is mostly dirt with nice switchbacks. We reach North Carolina and a twisted tree at Bly Gap, then the trail heads steeply upward again, as if to warn us the state is not to be taken lightly.Along some ridges the trees are dying, trunks covered with moss, and rhododendrons are colonizing the areas.
We pass two older thruhikers Pepera (French for grandpop) and Perdito (Spanish for lost). Perdito's gaiters are tye-dye hippy style.
At Muskrat Creek shelter I have a late lunch and share cheese with Mark, a somewhat quiet middle-aged thruhiker. Several hikers from different towns in Georgia are doing short sections. One is Sharon, whose son is starting a thruhike within days. 
Our group all decide to press on to the next shelter although it's already 4. I hike alone for awhile. From Yellow Mountain I see layer upon layer of mountain ranges in lighter and lighter shades of blue until they become indistinguishable from the sky. I swear I can see the imposing peaks of the Smokies off to the northwest.
A mile from the shelter at Deep Gap a pleasant surprise awaits us - trail magic! French Dip (AT '17) and Birthday Girl, who's hiked all but Maine, are handing out sodas, orange slices, and snack bags. It's a welcome break and our group has a chance to reunite before heading up to the shelter.
There are several weekenders tenting but the shelter is, incredibly, empty at 6pm. Someone has rigged up a hammock tarp to shield it from the wind on this knob. Clammy, me, and a 70-year-old slim woman named Flying Tiger occupy it while UNICEF, Fast Lane, Chris, and Pine Needle tent or hammock. Flying Tiger is a former pilot and Clemson Tigers fan.
After dinner I build a fire that attracts a crowd and we have a great time carousing and cracking jokes. Mostly about horrible trail names to bestow. Father and son section hikers join us. The ten-year-old boy Ridge has been doing sections since he was seven and wants to thruhike as soon as his father will allow. He helps feed and stoke the fire with Chris's (now called Hemlock after her favorite tree) guiding hand.

I head up a gradual ascent to Standing Indian's summit and chat with Cool Hand and Ridge, the father-son section hikers. I hike ahead, staring at the rocks I'm walking over, when I see movement at the switchback ahead and a tall brown furry creature lurches out from behind a tree ahead and moves toward me! I startle before my brain catches up and I realize it's a prank. Bigfoot pulls off his head to reveal ""Coach Bill 315"". He's getting some footage for his YouTube channel. He tries the same trick on Ridge, but the boy just stands there staring until Cool Hand comes up and he whispers to his dad ""There's a crazy guy in a hairy costume behind that tree."" But he's a good guy and a veteran hiker just enlivening the day.
It's easy, well-graded trail up and down today. No special views, but the neighboring ranges are generally in view between stands of rhododendron. Colors range from brown to hues of blue.
After a lunch stop at Carter Gap where I mistakenly follow a steep blue-blaze downhill trying to find the shelter, UNICEF and I march up trail and step off to take in a view. Slip n' Slide, a middle-aged Asian woman, is here along with Machinist with his large dalmatian-spotted dog Six-inch. The dog is carrying his own food and sleeping bag. Machinist says they started the trail 24 days ago.
At Mooney Gap we hike into trail magic courtesy of the Oconee Hiking Club in South Carolina! Chili dogs, fruit, and soda. Mmm. A young kid with dreads from Wisconsin is named Cheese Curd. There's a minimalist hiker named Flapjack trying to toughen up his feet to hike barefoot.
Hiking on, I think we're climbing Albert Mountain but the trail turns downhill into another gap. More trail magic! A familiar voice yells my name and invites me over. It's Birthday Girl and French Dip from yesterday's trail magic. They have campfire-roasted veggies, guacamole, and fruit! Double Mmm!
Finally we climb Albert Mountain, a very steep and rocky ascent which almost requires scrambling. Kind of like the Whites, except it stops after ten minutes instead of three hours!
There's a fire tower and incredible 360 degree views from the top. It's a clear day and once again I swear I can see the Smokies. Probably not, but it's fun to see where we're headed.
I have service for the first time in days at this high point. Even in Hiawassee service was very poor. I call home but nobody's there. I was looking forward to hearing everyone. Hopefully I get service again soon. 
The trail down to Long Branch shelter is very fast and nondescript. The shelter is a beautiful two-story structure with a huge overhang, but it's full and all the kind-of level tent sites are taken. About 35 people are already here and more on their way. The hiking club counted 46 at the trail magic. It's going to storm tonight so we make a game-time decision to move on another 3.6 miles to the next shelter. 
Again the trail is fast and easy and mostly downhill. The Rock Gap shelter is next to a road that goes to Franklin. Only a few people are here. I grab a shelter spot to stay out of the storm. 
Trim Tab, also on trailjournals, has a fire going. He has me sign his pink guitar. He doesn't play much, but out of a crowd of 12 we find Fast Lane knows a few licks. Also here are a woman named Raindancer, a girl named Sassafras and another girl just-christened Turnip. Also a retired guy from Sandusky, Ohio named Jo-o-oe! (like Norm! from Cheers), and a pair of brothers thruhiking together sharing a tent. They haven't killed each other yet!

I have a very restless night in the shelter. We are packed in like sardines. Between the brother hikers streaming video in their nearby tent and snoring from other shelter dwellers, I put in my ear plugs for the first time.  Halfway through the night I throw off several layers because I'm sweating, even though it's just as cold as the last few nights. Rain showers intermittently pummel the shelter and some drops hit my face and gear. I'm lying head out because the shelter leans back, so I gradually slide towards my feet. I rotate frequently to find a comfortable position for my back. Eventually dawn comes. I must have slept at some point because Clammy said I snored.
It's supposed to drop into the teens tonight so we decide to head into Franklin. Our gear is three-season, not ready for sub-20 temperatures. Rock Gap is next to the shelter and Zen, the owner of Gooder Grove hostel, walks in to offer a ride. But since we have reserved at the Budget we demur and hike the four miles over to Winding Stair Gap to the main road into town.
It's a crisp and comfortably cool morning for a hike. The hill between the gaps is steeper than it looks, but there's a sweeping view near the top. 
At Winding Stair Gap we regroup and prepare to hitch in pairs. But Zen drives up in his rented Sprinter van and offers a ride for gas money so we take the easy option. He takes us back to Rock Gap to drop a hiker and pick up others, then back to Winding Stair Gap to pick up more. Then into town to drop folks off at several motels. Finally we get to the Budget Inn. The rented Sprinter van will need a good vacuuming after this run.
Waiting for the room to be ready we have burgers and milkshakes at Motor Company Grill, the only restaurant open in downtown on Sunday. We amble down Main Street where nearly everything is closed. The exception is the Outdoor 76 outfitters. I call home and at last get to talk with Sara and the kids while Clammy and Fast Lane upgrade some gear. Fast Lane gets new insoles with better arch support and is told to slow down!
At the motel we dry out gear in the sun and some folks do laundry. I skip it since it's been only three days since Hiawassee. Then, pulling Clammy away from the UK basketball game, we head to Dollar General to resupply. The Elevations pizza joint we expected to find nearby doesn't exist anymore, so UNICEF and I get Mexican at Mi Casa. Yum! 
Once back we head off again to the Lazy Hiker Brewing Company, a Franklin and AT institution. Raindancer and Sassafras are here, Jo-o-oe! soon joins, and Joe, formerly known as Sinatra, who I camped with my second night, also appears. He got off at Deep Gap, 24 miles behind Winding Stair Gap, because he needs better shoes and because of the cold front. Raindancer has already replaced her shoes due to swelling in her toes. She dropped her old boots into the hiker box alongside two other pairs. From the same box I scored a new pair of insoles for my Altras. They happen to be the exact size I need! My old insoles have seen 800 miles and have little cushioning left so this is a pleasant surprise to buffer my feet until I pick up my new shoes at Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) in a couple days. The trail provides!
A few hours of trivial pursuit and cornhole later, including an epic double cornhole for the win which marks the highlight of UNICEF's life (in his words), the brewpub is closing down and we head back.

Nevermind, it's pancake breakfast time! The First Baptist Church picks up all the hikers willing to get out of bed and takes us over to their Church for a free pancake and bacon feast. The room fills up quickly and pancakes disappear even faster. They take each hiker's picture and give them a card to write that they will mail wherever we want. They do this everyday for a month or more during thruhiker season. What an amazing bunch of people! The assistant pastor, a young bearded guy in jeans and a UT sweatshirt gives us a little pep talk / sermon about God helping those with heavy burdens. I appreciate his words. One of the volunteers at out table hands out ""ultralight"" Bibles the size of a matchbook with a few Psalms and Gospel verses. I'll carry that and perhaps find some inspiration when I need it.
At the motel we pack up and board a town shuttle to the trail. Most people are headed back. We start off at Winding Stair Gap and quickly space out. Clammy and Fast Lane disappear up the trail. I catch up with Trim Tab, who's loving his new backpack, and using his guitar as a coat rack. 
The trail is slick from thawed ice left over from the rain two nights ago. I let down my guard while texting my brother and slip and fall on my side with my poles and phone flying. Yikes! Gotta be more careful. My shoes have 800 miles on them and hardly any traction left. So I spend the rest of the day viligently using my poles and watching my step.I catch up with UNICEF and Fast Lane at Siler Bald. It's a steep climb from the trail over an open field that looks like an out of season ski run. Going up we meet Carry On, a 74 year old Santa-looking thruhiker aiming to be there oldest to reach Katahdin this year. More power to him! But he's got tough competition from Enoch and probably others!
A thin mustached guy with a thick North Carolina accent named Slim and a thirty-ish bearded guy from Those Island named Candy are resting along the trail. Still no sign of Clammy. We assume he stopped at Siler shelter. He was supposed to go easy on his knee and log a pain-free day.
On the way up Wayah Bald I run into a man backpacking with his young son and daughter. They're headed to Nantahala but not eager to start the  climb. I tell them about hiking with my kids and encourage them to have some fun and adopt trail names.
A few miles later we reach Wayah Bald with its stone firetower. The surrounding forest is charred from a 2016 fire. The wooden lookout atop the tower burned and has been rebuilt. Here we can definitively see the Smokies, as well as everything else we have hiked the last three days or will hike in the next week. The ridges are sharp and clear. Distant ranges are visible that aren't even drawn on the panorama map that identified the peaks. 
The room underneath the tower has great acoustics. A girl named Librarian who's recorded an album is testing it out. She's with Soccer Mom, who whips out fruit snacks and offers them to everyone. Another girl named Plug is sitting in the sun and never wants to leave. She spent the frigid night in a shelter with 10 other people literally rolling on top of each other. It's been a chilly morning and ice still lingers on the trail in the form of mounds of thin strands that look like frost heave.
UNICEF can't resist the stone tower and free solo climbs it up to the first landing. I test it out and he gets really concerned about my form. Some of us weren't meant to climb!
Still no sign of Clammy, we head on down Wayah Bald towards Cold Springs shelter where we plan to spend the night. On the way I find a wide guy named Beast slowly trucking on. He doesn't like the uphills. There has been a good bit of that today. Not too steep, but long climbs to Siler and Wayah Balds.
Cold Springs shelter is packed, and every tent site is taken. I don't recognize anyone. We have hiked straight into ""The Bubble"". A huge number of hikers who started on the first day of spring, several days before us. Tonight is supposed to be cold, so even if there were tent spots on this ridge near 5000 feet elevation we wouldn't want them.
UNICEF stays put, trying to find a site. He's tired. Fast Lane and I are more motivated to find a quieter site so we head towards Tellico Gap, another three miles. This getting to be a pattern. 
It's steep hillside all along the way with no stealth spots. A small campsite at Big Springs is full. My feet are feeling the miles now. We plunge down into the gap and find a pleasant surprise. 
Trail magic!
Baked beans and turkey sausage cooked over a campfire by a father and son pair of hikers. I wish I could remember their names but they are from Suches Georgia and had a lovable bird dog with them. Thank you guys! Just what we needed!
There's no real camping area so we setup our tents in a parking cutout surrounded by stacked beam landscape berms. It's a quiet gravel mountain forest road but a couple trucks do pass over the evening.  I hope no trucks try to pull in after dark!
There are power lines, but they can't obscure a beautiful sunset that backlights mountains to the west and highlights mountains to the east. 
Tomorrow it's on to Nantahala Outdoor Center where I have my new pair of shoes waiting. Also a restaurant. Not sure which one I'm looking forward to more! 
It's going to be a cold one tonight so I'm heading in to bundle up.","Winding Stair Gap / Franklin
",Tellico Gap,"Apr 01, Mon",19.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609403,"Long down to NOC and up again with snow, new shoes, and lots of new people.
We all break the tents down at Tellico Gap, grab our food bags out of the tree over the trail, and hike out without cooking. NOC ( Nantahala Outdoor Center) has a restaurant and is only eight miles away.
Also tenting or hammocking at the gap were Treebeard, Moonpie, Slow 'n Steady, and Freight Train. Don't expect to see them again. They'll be stopping at NOC for the night.
Fate has elected to keep our merry band together. Last night Fast Lane and I caught Clammy just as he was leaving the gap. He had thought we were ahead of him. It was enough to convince him to stay and break his streak of not putting up his tent. For a PCT/CDT hiker who never saw a shelter before this trip he's adapted quickly to the relative luxury! Meanwhile UNICEF couldn't find a tent spot at Cold Springs so he followed us down to the gap. Looks like we're stuck with each other for awhile! We're thinking of starting a four-part harmony barbershop quartet. Look for our album to be released from the trail.
It's a short hike over/up to Wesser Bald. It starts flurrying then snowing. Standing atop the firetower the view is very different from yesterday at Wayah. A wintry landscape is barely visible through the falling snow. 
At the bottom of the tower is a strange sight: an abandoned tent, fly torn off, snow collecting inside, leaning heavily to one side. The sleeping bags look like they were recently occupied. There are overturned camp chairs and a half-full bottle of Gatorade perched on the tower support. Did the occupants get scared off by the cold or an animal? Or go for a dayhike and leave everything a mess?  No way to tell. I'm betting on alien abduction. 
The hike down to NOC is long and uneventful. Falling 3000 feet below Wesser Bald, the trail is often steep and rocky, but there are also long stretches of dirt switchbacks.
By late morning Fast Lane and I make it to NOC. There are many hikers around but we recognize nobody. We've passed into a new group. I make a beeline for the outfitter. They've been holding the new shoes I had shipped to me. My old Altra Lone Peaks now have at least 800 miles on them and have no traction left. The new ones are the 4.0 version, bought with my REI 20% discount. They are a beautiful sight coming out of the box. The contrast is stark. I slip them on like gloves and they immediately feel comfortable. I feel like I should have a ceremonial burning of my old shoes. They're like old friends. But they're going into the dumpster because I ain't carrying them!
A lesser acquisition is a new Smartwater bottle to replace one that has seen better days. They're amazingly resilient given the constant abuse they take. But they are hard to clean so must be occasionally renewed.
UNICEF arrives so we head to lunch awaiting Clammy. Missing Person joins us, a medical editor from Austin who's hiked the AT three times, twice in sections, and has been keeping pace with us since the beginning. Clammy and Mudturkey eventually join too. Everything looks great, but a little pricey given the touristy area. I opt for a chicken salad sandwich. A massive stuffed sandwich comes out and I can only finish half. No worries, I'll pack it out and have no cooking tonight!
Earlier there were two dozen backpacks outside the outfitters, but now the tourists have arrived and taken over. We go back in to print out backcountry permits for the Smokies. Like many national parks it is very popular with backpackers so there is a reservation system for the shelters and nightly fees. Thruhikers (defined as anyone starting and ending at least 50 miles outside the park) get special treatment given the unpredictability of our itineraries. $20 lets you stay at any shelter along the AT over an eight day period. But we must yield shelter space to other reserved hikers. Not a problem, since the Smokies shelters are notoriously crowded, noisy, and generally unpleasant places to sleep. Being forced to tent nearby is a briar patch I'll gladly be thrown in.
Outside I recognize a Hawaiian guy named One Way from Cold Springs shelter. He reports the shelter was over-packed, with people rolling on top of one another. Two even slept in the privy in search of level ground. Sounds like we made the right call moving on.
It's time to hike out to the next shelter, which means hiking up 3000 feet out of the Nantahala gorge. It's only seven miles but takes over three hours. It's often steep but only occasionally rocky. Along the way I meet a German hiker from Berlin named August out for a section. After one particularly steep climb I reach the highest point, called Swim Bald, and let out my barbaric Yawp! as I often do after a challenging climb. The ""Bald"" is forested however, so no special view. Of course with no leaves yet there are good views pretty much everywhere. A rock outcropping called the ""Jump-Up"" has the only unobstructed view.
Approaching Sassafras Gap shelter I hear whoops and hollers. A lively crowd it seems. I'm encouraged to hike on, but the likely next sites will be on Cheoah Bald, 700 feet higher and consequently colder. Clammy has nabbed a spot in the crowded shelter, so he's happily staying put. UNICEF, Fast Lane, and I find somewhat level tent sites far apart. The area is a steep slope from a saddle between two peaks. Not a good place to host the four dozen campers here.  
One hiker near me up in the saddle, where the wind is strong, says fewer hikers have dropped off this year since the weather has been relatively mild. The last two years saw blizzards in March. I guess we can expect more oversubscribed shelters for awhile.
The large crowd around the fire seem to be a close-knit tramily and are not particular friendly to outsiders, so I hike over to my neighbors in the saddle. One of their tents is practically in their fire pit so we can't start a fire. One guy is David, who started a week before me and twisted his ankle walking up to Springer from the parking lot. He kept to five miles a day for the first week. Then there are two brothers Leafpicker and Canoe who started in Maine last summer and hiked to High Point in New Jersey. Now they have flip-flopped to Springer to go north and finish. They calculate they'll hit their 1000 mile mark tomorrow.
The wind is penetratingly cold so I retreat into my tent for the night.
One last item I forgot to report several days ago was meeting boy scout troop 564 from Atlanta near Deep Gap at the GA/NC border. The dozen boys and four leaders were finishing up an 85 mile trek from Fontana. Congratulations guys! Having just covered fifty miles of that I can say it was no easy feat.","Tellico Gap

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609537,"Sunny ridge walking towards Fontana. Jacob's Ladder and a lazy afternoon at Cable Gap shelter.
Woke up above Sassafras Gap to about 30 degrees and breezy. Clammy yells a wake up to me as he walks by heading out. I skip a hot breakfast and pack up. It's great when everything is so dry. Advantage: winter hiking. I'm happy to leave the crowded shelter as I head up to Cheoah Bald. 
Target from Britain is already at the top admiring the view. There's a great tent spot and fire ring. Would have been amazing to push up to here last night and see the sunset and sunrise. Oh well, take the opportunity when it arises!
I spend the next six hours hiking over rolling ridges with Clammy, UNICEF, and Missing Person, including a challenging steep climb called Jacob's Ladder. There are a lot of blowdowns in this section. Along the way we meet Stick Figure coming out of Brown Fork Gap shelter. She's named after the stick figure totems attached to her bag.
At Stecoah Gap I meet Monk, a forty-something guy heading to a hostel to nurse an injured knee. Clammy is taking it easy today, trying to get through a day without his IT band acting up. Even UNICEF is complaining of knee pain on the downhills.
At 2:30 we arrive at Cable Gap shelter, over 15 miles in. Everyone's ready to call it a day, partly to rest their joints and partly because we get the small shelter to ourselves. But mostly because we want to walk the next seven miles into Fontana tomorrow morning and have time for rest and chores before we head into the Smokies.
Having more time on my hands than usual, I soak my feet in the creek (downstream from the piped water source of course), and rinse out my sweaty shirt. It's warm today with the sun beating down through the barren trees. I've seen the occasional daisy or violet and now some yellow flowers. The maples are beginning to show red buds.
After a late lunch/early dinner, I gather firewood and build a fire. First I dig out a pit in the pyramid of ash that's formed over the years. A fire ring rock tumbles into my ankle. Yowch! That's gonna leave a mark. 
Several folks come in to camp. A guy named Pura Vida (pure/good life) who's spent most of his life in Costa Rica. A guy named Gandalf from last night who smokes a long carved pipe. Stick Figure comes over to eat and shares her theracane (massage hook) that she picked up in NOC. Man that feels good on my knotted shoulder and back muscles!
Overall a good day of hiking. Tomorrow: town, laundry, shower, and restaurant, not necessarily in that order.","Sassafras Gap shelter
",Cable Gap shelter,"Apr 03, Wed",15.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609560,"I have the most restful night in many days, only rolling around after 3 or 4 am. It's in the mid-forties and feels comfortable without bundling up. By 7 we're all up. I do some push-ups and back and core exercises to ward off lower back issues that I've had in the past. Keeping my upper body and core strength is important since my body will react to any calorie deficit by taking from my torso muscles to feed my legs. 
35 minutes later I'm hiking up out of Cable Gap, skipping oatmeal in favor of snacks on the go. There's a sunrise view of Fontana Lake from the ridge through the trees with the Smokies in the background highlighted in golden bands. Understory shrubs are budding and about to leaf even at 3500 feet. The trillium are about to open, and as I descend to the lake they are in full bloom with dark red or yellow petals.
I catch up with Fast Lane at the marina and walk down to the docks for an iced tea and one of last summer's Dixie cups from the bait shop. Houseboats are scattered around the lake, which is green and sparkling in the sun. The marina itself is roofed and full of fishing boats. Oddly the lakeshore is devoid of plant life for about 25 vertical feet, giving the appearance of a desert mesa. Either rain is down this year or they have drained off some of the reservoir.
A guy named Tin Can is here, heading directly into the Smokies after resupplying and resting yesterday in Robbinsville. But most hikers are taking their break here in Fontana.
The village shuttle is sitting here, but after talking to the driver we opt to hike closer to the park and get picked up at the visitor's center. So we hike on, coming first to the Fontana Hilton, known as the best shelter on the trail. It has showers, a charging station, an enormous deck with fire pit overlooking the lake, and room for 20. Smokey, Professor, and Reno are still here and say only a few hikers were sleeping in the shelter last night. But I'm betting The Bubble is about to arrive this afternoon to fill this place up. 
We hike down to the Fontana Dam Visitor's Center to catch the shuttle so we can start as close to the park as possible tomorrow. But we find the visitor's center doesn't open for the season until May! And there is no public phone to call for pickup like the shuttle driver promised. We have no cell service so we run around harassing nice couples to see if they have service. Finally UNICEF and I run up the hill a half mile to find service. I get three bars intermittently but can't get a call out. As we approach the Hilton, we run into Mudturkey and he lends us his Verizon phone. Service! We get the call in for the shuttle, then turn around and start back. A truck is coming up the lightly traveled road. Suddenly it pulls over and the driver waves us up. Fast Lane, Clammy and Smokey are in the back with all our packs. They scored a hitch from the visitor's center! We jump in, with the tailgate open, and white knuckle the three hilly miles up to Fontana Village, passing the shuttle in the process. It's a gorgeous open-air ride. Not an unusual situation for thruhikers though.
They drop us off at a gas station at the village crossroads. We figure out that the lodge is uphill. After a twenty minute steep climb up the entrance driveway we finally find the registration desk. $20 bucks apiece for a stay at the resort is plenty reasonable! 
The rest of the afternoon goes smoothly. Shower, lunch, laundry, resupply at The General Store. While we wait on laundry lots of hikers arrive, many resupplying before heading to the shelter. The General Store makes for much better resupply than I've heard. A lot of people at the front desk were picking up resupply boxes they had shipped to themselves. Unless you have special dietary needs this really isn't necessary. 
I get some souvenirs for Sara and the kids at the same store and ship them home at the tiny post office next door. The nice lady gives me a free postcard stamp when I come up empty with small change.
Grisu, the Swiss hiker from Neel Gap, pops out of the shuttle. He's headed home after his two-week test hike. His thruhike is two or three years away. Waiting on the dryer with my rain jacket still on, I chat with Stripes, a French-speaker from Montreal. This is his second thruhike attempt. Two years ago he injured his knee in the first attempt. He's been waiting two years to get an appointment with a specialist in Canada's government-run health care system. He actually started this hike before getting to see the doctor. He got off trail last week to go home for the appointment. He'll hike until he can't, regardless of what the tests turn up. 
There's a girl with a nervous dog named Riggles. He snaps at me when I come too close. ""He's shy"" she warns.  She has to send the dog to the other end of the Smokies to a kennel because dogs are not allowed in the park.
I recognize many hikers from the last two days but everyone is taking care of chores so I go back to the room to break down the resupply. 
We return to the Grill restaurant for dinner because the Bistro is closed due to ""circumstances beyond their control,"" according to the front desk. It's early in the season and most of the guests are hikers. The Grill's draft tap stopped functioning during lunch until they figured out it was low on CO2. The stores all close at 5. The pools are uncovered but green and full of leaves. 
Warning - avoid the temptation of the Two-for-$12 appetizers. At lunch Fast Lane got an enormous appetizer that could have been a meal. I hit upon the idea of getting two and feasting. Not to be. Not only are the portions smaller when you order two, they are even smaller than the supposed discount you are getting. For Southwestern eggrolls I got 3 half eggrolls. What they did with the odd half God knows. The waiter, with a Russian accent, doesn't seem to get that I am hungry and not happy. To add insult to injury the check shows it as $14 not 12. ""Yes, we will print up new menus"" is all he has to say when I point this out. I have to ask him to fix it. Don't mess with hiker hunger!
Afterwards, we walk way, waaaay down the hill to the gas station to get dessert. It closed at 5. Ouch! On the bright side, the walk uphill helps the digestion.
So it's a quiet evening resting up for our entry into the Smokies tomorrow!PS - service is likely to be spotty to non-existent in the Smokies so I may not be able post new entries for 4-6 days.","Cable Gap shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609678,"It's getting really hard to sleep in. Even though we were up late watching movies in Fontana Lodge I'm awake and alert well before dawn and can't stay in bed. It rained all night and will continue to drizzle throughout the morning.
The other guys decide to take the shuttle and hike out early, mostly to nab shelter spots I think. I plan to hang around the lodge until noon so I can use their WiFi for a special task. After I finish the trail in Damascus I'll be taking my three boys to Arizona and Utah for some camping and backpacking in the national parks. Today I need to reserve a backcountry permit for Zion, over two months ahead of time. The window opens exactly at noon and the spots will go quickly.
I fiddle most of the morning with a way to call home and talk to my family before I enter the Smokies. It's been four or five days since I spoke to them and God knows when I will be able to again. But I have no cell signal in Fontana and my phone doesn't support Wifi calling. Finally I get a VoIP app to work and get to speak with Sara and the kids for fifteen minutes. My son just made Life Scout and I'm very proud. And my daughter is preparing to start on her Girl Scout Gold Award, their highest achievement. I can't wait to be with them all again.
Precisely at noon I log in and manage to get a Zion reservation. Within a few minutes virtually everything is booked. Wow! Popular park.
I make a plan to pick up my hiking pace to get to Damascus in two weeks so I can get home for Easter. I could continue to take it relatively easy and hang with the friends I've made, but I would have to schedule another section hike to finish the trail. To finish by April 19th requires just over 20 miles a day. Most people would think that crazy, but I averaged 23-24 miles over most of the trail between Damascus and New Hampshire. It's a difficult decision for me. Smiles before miles, but every day away from my family is hard.
Finally I catch the shuttle back to the dam visitor's center. The driver tells me they've drained the lake to perform maintenance on the dam. That's why the shoreline looks so barren.
I hike over Fontana Dam, built during the war and the tallest dam in the east. A section hiker from Atlanta named John joins me. He's hiking the Smokies, adding to previous hikes that have gotten him up to Fontana.
We encounter a young woman leaving the park and I'm about to congratulate her for finishing what I assume is a southbound crossing, but she is actually a northbounder bailing out and going back to town. It rained last night and she believes it will continue to rain and is not comfortable continuing with her wet tent. The weather is actually supposed to be nice today and tomorrow, but she has already made up her mind.
The next two miles go up almost two thousand feet so it's steep and tiring. I hear more birds singing and it is much more humid than at any time this trip. I am quickly sweating. The Smokies feels like the rainforest that it is. On the way up I see three young guys that look like they should run circles around me. They are finishing up a break and jump to hike ahead of me, no doubt assuming they'd have to pass me anyway. I don't insult their manhood by trying to pass and just hang back twenty yards. But after a half mile they tire and stop to take off their packs. I hike past and wave.
Below the sidetrail to the Shuckstack firetower, Lady Poles and Wubby are lounging and smoking. They're part of a group of 8 or 10 who call themselves the Misfits. That group seems to constitute the core of The Bubble of hikers who started around March 20, and whom I would like to get ahead of.
Two dayhikers heading up to the firetower call me Fresh Legs as I pass. They look not much older than me, and have no backpacks, but the five mile hike from Fontana has clearly taxed them.
A portly hiker named Caveman is up in the Shuckstack tower. There are great views over Fontana Lake, the mountains to the south and east, and foothills in Tennessee to the west. But the Smokies are, appropriately, in the clouds.
Once up on the ridge the trail rolls over a number of hills with small but occasionally steep climbs. I see Sawdust, a retiree from Aiken, SC again. I had met him yesterday at the laundromat. When he learns my name he remembers why I look familiar. He read my trail journal a couple years ago. The one I'm still adding to!
I pass by a girl named Little Blade resting by the trailside. She's from Berwyn, PA and we met a couple days ago when she was excited to meet me based on my name being a nearby town. Nice kid.
I also pass a grumpy young stocky blonde guy who proceeds to tell me how he hates the Smokies, the climb, the permits, the camping rules, and paying to hike here. I tell him my story of spending the morning to land a permit for Zion. The Smokies permit, in contrast, is guaranteed and easy. He thinks the rangers are here to harass him if it takes him more than 8 days to exit the park. I've met very few rangers who weren't as helpful and friendly as possible, especially to hikers. I'm sure the Smokies is no different.
I mentioned Stripes before, from Quebec. He's the last person I pass before I reach the first shelter, Mollie's Ridge. He has a great attitude and I like him.
The shelter is full, with many people tenting. Stick Figure and Gandalf are here along with some of the Misfits and others I remember from The Bubble. There are several Brits among them. One of the hikers tells me Clammy, UNICEF, and Fast Lane moved on after eating lunch here.
I take advantage of cell signal to check messages while hiking over the Devil's Tater Patch (what a great name). I hear a loud rustle to the right and what is probably a deer running off, though in my mind it's a bear. But no sooner do my eyes return to the trail than I hear a loud grunt from my left. I whirl my head and a dark beast is staring at me from maybe fifty feet away. The ears are too large for a bear, and I've never known one to grunt. But I'm concerned that I've walked between a mama and her cub! Thankfully the beast crashes away into the brush. I'm pretty certain it was a wild boar, also not a critter to mess with. I'm on edge for the next mile. I see one or two cloven hoof marks in the mud, confirming my suspicion.
At Russell Field shelter I'm reunited with the gang. The only other people here are Scrub-a-dub and Liv, who own Riggles, the shy and prickly dog I met in town. Riggles is in a kennel since dogs are prohibited in the Smokies. Everyone else stopped at the first shelter. They are only three miles apart.
Clammy builds a fire in the shelter's fireplace using what little dry material we can find, while I heat up Pad Thai for dinner. The fire is warm and cheery and we all huddle around it chatting and laughing. Liv will henceforth be known as Scarecrow because she took the brain off her backpack (the brain is a detachable compartment that sits on top). ""Jamie Lee Curtis Yogurt"" is a close second and the inside joke of the night.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609799,"It's a quiet misty morning. I'm awake well before sunrise again. I can't sleep nine or ten hours every night. It's warmer than I remember it being any other morning, probably in the high 40s. The sun is trying to penetrate through the clouds that envelope the area.
I'm the last of our group out, even though I'm planning a long day to get over Clingmans Dome while the weather is good. I passed 1900 miles on my hike yesterday. But plenty is still to come. If I was a true NOBO I would not have entered Maine yet.
Hiking is easy in the morning. It's cool and the trail is nice, though often muddy. I catch Clammy and Fast Lane at Rocky Top, still surrounded by clouds. It feels sub-alpine, with low brush. Thunderhead mountain is covered in a six foot rhododendron forest, so no views.
The trail follows the Tennessee and North Carolina border from here for the next 200 miles. Right foot in North Carolina, left in Tennessee. As the day goes on it's more rolling ridges, usually muddy and often rooty and rocky. So far my new shoes are working out well on the slippery ground. My ankle, however, is bothering me a bit since that rock tumbled on it from the fire ring three days ago.
I'm over 4000 feet all day long, including about five miles above 6000 feet. This is one of the highest ridges on the AT. Fortunately the weather is great. The clouds lift by mid-morning and the sun peeks out occasionally. The forest floor is greening up and looks park-like with a light green carpet between the trees.
Along the way I meet two young guys named Physics and Howdy (wearing a Stetson). I chat with Kermit, a retiree with a potbelly, who's already hiked the trail and is just hiking til he feels like stopping. At a shelter for lunch I chat with Energizer Turtle from Montreal. He's a redbearded fiftyish guy who got his name from keeping up with much younger guys while hiking in Nepal.
At Double Springs Gap shelter I take leave of UNICEF and Fast Lane. They're torn between stopping to stay with Clammy, who has not caught up yet but was already feeling knee pain earlier, and heading over Clingmans while the sun is shining. Everyone's gotta hike their own hike. They've got time, I don't. I may hang out tomorrow and wait for them. Still haven't decided whether to push hard to make Damascus by Easter. Either way I don't want to climb Clingmans Dome in the rain or mist. I've already done that!
The trail enters fir and spruce forest. It's shady, silent, green - very different from the lower elevations, which were much like the rest of North Carolina.
As I near the trail to the parking lot I find a man in jeans sitting by the trail sketching the mountain vista. He is the only daytripper who's hiked away from the lookout tower. At Clingmans Dome there are many families visiting the tower on this clear day, but it's not crowded. I climb the spiral ramp with my pack. It's clear enough to see Mt Mitchell, the tallest peak east of the Rockies, over 73 miles away. I'm glad I made the hike this evening.
It's three miles down and over Mt Collins to the shelter, which is a further half mile off trail. It's one of the highest elevation shelters on the trail. It is what it is, but were it not for park regulations I'd probably stealth camp than walk to the shelter. No matter, it's a decent crowd. About a dozen thruhikers, none of whom I know, and three or four pairs of weekend backpackers. One of them has a full stick of butter. Some blessed woman gives me an orange. It is so delicious! I eat my first Mountain House meal - lasagna - that I packed out of Fontana because it was relatively cheap. It's easy cooking and cleanup and satisfying.  
Among the thruhikers here are Food Truck, Sweet Life, Chat-Awhile, Curly, and a retired couple called Lolli and Pop who started March 9th. Most of the others started around March 15th.

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609894,"Rain started during the night. Between the intermittent showers and my earplugs the numerous snorers didn't bother me. In fact I slept so well I actually dreamed for the first time on this hike. I dreamed about my wife, Sara, only she was younger, like when we first dated. It was such a nice dream I wept a little when I woke. It was only 3. 
Another warmish morning. All the weekenders are up early. It's still raining, and my crew is six miles behind me, so I feel no rush to get up. But I do anyway because I've been lying there for ten hours.
I ask two southbound weekend hikers to carry a message to Clammy, Fast Lane and UNICEF. I also leave a note in the shelter register and a message on the ground in sticks at the turnoff to the shelter that I am moving on and will meet them at Newfound Gap. 
Chats-Awhile pops out as I'm finishing my stick message and we, appropriately enough, chat awhile. He's a mason from Lancaster county in Pennsylvania, 41, with two kids, light-colored beard, and penetrating eyes. His knee has been bothering him enough he went to urgent care. The doctor told him if he had to have a knee problem his was the kind to have. Something about the scapula folding over.
Nearing the Gap I hike a little with Curly, who is a tall lean fellow maybe sixty with a long curly reddish-white beard. It's his first hike and the uphills are tough for him, but he puts in the miles.
By Newfound Gap the rain has petered out and the clouds lift. It's very busy. People are constantly coming and going. A van from the Baptist Church is offering a ride to town. But I'm waiting on my buddies to see what they want to do. I hang out with Chats-Awhile, Curly, and Sweet Life who are waiting on a ride they arranged. A lady walks up with a white blaze shirt and offers a ride to town. She's local and came up just to help hikers. Eventually she finds some passengers. I sit on a stone wall and eat lunch next to a car from Hawaii. In a short walk I see cars from twenty different states.
Two hikers exit a shuttle van. They are a man and wife from London thruhiking and have just come back from Gatlinburg. More hikers arrive from town and several others leave for town. After a couple hours UNICEF shows up. My message hot through. Fast Lane takes awhile. He took a wrong turn at Clingmans Dome and went a mile out of his way. He also got a hole in his quilt last night, so not a great morning so far. FedEx, a woman from my shelter last night, appears, along with Scrub-a-Dub and Scarecrow. Clammy finally appears as well to join in for lunch. 
We decide to skip town and hike out another ten miles to Pecks Corner shelter. Everyone has enough food, though UNICEF seems to be cutting it close, and wants to save money on a room. Only later do I realize I could have gotten lunch in town and come back while waiting for them. Dummy!
I hike with Scrub-a-Dub, Scarecrow, and UNICEF most of the afternoon. Fast Lane takes off as usual. Stopping in at Icewater Spring shelter I demonstrate my habit of exiting the same way I entered so I don't miss any of the AT. Fast Lane and UNICEF take it as a challenge and do the same. 
We come to Charlie's Bunion, a rock outcropping with imposing views of the deep gorges surrounding it. I scramble out to the point for a better view. I should have vertigo, but I feel comfortable enough. Enough so that I scramble up a rock spire jutting above the overlook. Coming down is more difficult. UNICEF, the rock climber, gives me tips and says he'll make a climber out of me yet.
The afternoon hike is over rolling ridges, but the tread is mostly rocky and, of course, very wet. The trail often follows a knife edge ridge with sharp dropoffs on either side. The views are fabulous, with blue mountains in the distance framed by the nearby steep slopes. Rain holds off until late afternoon. 
Scarecrow turns out to be a very fast hiker, determined to reach her destination. This will be their first twenty-mile day. But at one point she takes a fall and cuts her hand on a rock. They have no bandages so I crack open my kit and help fix her up. I fell myself earlier stepping the wrong way on a slick root, but fortunately fell on my soft bottom and was uninjured.
We finally reach the shelter, which is a half mile off the trail, and are surprised to see Clammy here already. The shelter is very full, with almost twenty people packing in. Clammy will be sleeping on the ground inside the shelter. The rest of us search the slim pickings for tent sites. I made due with a hollow with roots in it that is at least close to level. It's supposed to rain quite a but tonight so I'm hoping the runoff won't pool under my tent. UNICEF, pitching his tent nearby, smells excrement and thinks he may have pitched over something nasty. 
It's a good crowd at the shelter while I make a noodle dinner. This is another bubble, mostly people who started around March 15th and who bunched up at NOC and moved north together. We chat with Double Stuft - who has two puffy jackets - and Kiwi, a girl from New Zealand. UNICEF starts my climber training with board hangs from the shelter roof rafters. I have nothing near the finger strength needed. 
Torrential rain showers hit the covered eating area several times. Eventually dusk approaches and we take advantage of a lull to get in our tents. Tomorrow we'll near the end of the Smokies.","Mt Collins shelter
",Pecks Corner shelter,"Apr 07, Sun",15.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609954,"It showered several times overnight but fortunately it stops in the early morning hours. I have a huge root under my lower back. It actually provides pretty good lumbar support! The birds are singing well before light and I reluctantly pull myself out of the sleeping bag. It's a relatively warm morning so that eases the pain. 
I grab the food bags from the bear wires and drop them off for Fast Lane and UNICEF, waking him up. Clammy is already hiking out. Fast Lane disappears soon without a word.
I start breaking down the wet tent (sigh) but take a break to make oatmeal. The British couple I met at Newfound Gap yesterday have the same idea. Wumble is named after a British children's show character, and Morph is named after what sounds like an orange, British version of Gumby. They love hiking in the US because UK hiking is mostly through farms without potable water, or scrubby Highlands without trees. Of course British hikes typically end each day at a pub, so there's that.
I try to segregate my wet tent and poncho from my dry gear, and hike out. This shelter was packed, partly because of a large group of section hikers. Indian Americans, I chatted with them for a bit last night and they had tons of questions about thruhiking. But mostly they kept to themselves and chatted in Hindi. Clammy slept on the shelter dirt floor last night and said one of them came in late, stepped on his sleeping pad with a boot, then stuck his trekking pole in the pad. It survived, but not cool.
We plan a twenty mile day to get to the third shelter. The first is too close, and everyone seems to be headed to the second, so we are trying to get ahead of this new bubble. 
The morning hike climbs and dips over the ridge line. Everything is shrouded in fog. It's not actively raining but the air is cool and crisp and I'm full of energy. I burst up the hills and cover the thirteen miles to the second shelter, Cosby Knob, in a little over four hours. 
Along the way I pass Bubbles, who stayed at the first shelter I pass, Tricorner Knob. She's a little older and not feeling fast, and she's stressed out about getting a shelter spot because her tent wetted out last night. 
I catch up with Scarecrow and Scrub-a-Dub. The cut on Scarecrow's hand stopped bleeding. I give her more Band-Aids to keep it clean til they get to town. They aren't going far today.
In late morning, rain showers come and go. I'm over 6000 feet much of the time and the winds are roaring across the knife edge ridges, alternatively pelting me with rain then drying me out like a bathroom hand dryer. Hikers can barely hear each other over the wind sometimes. I greet a number of new faces as I approach Cosby Knob shelter.
I'm the second one here after Fast Lane. But a dozen people soon pour in while I eat lunch. We figure out there are eleven section hikers headed here for the night. Since section hikers have shelter-specific reservations, that means there will be only a few berths for thruhikers. So most of us opt to down some Vitamin I (ibuprofen) and hike another seven miles to the third shelter.
It's mostly downhill, dropping almost 2500 feet from Mt Cammerer with barely a break. It's very muddy trail, and where there's no mud there's scree (loose rock) or wet roots. The mud often is covered by wet leaves. So it's slip-sliding downhill, with foot placement very important. Fortunately it's not raining....yet. 
I pass three dayhikers going up to see Mt Cammerer, which is too far off-trail to bother with on a viewless day. One lady is very interested in my hike. She did 250 miles on the Camino, a pilgrimage through Spain. She gets philosophical about what I can expect to get out of my hike. Happiness comes from within, she says. True. At the moment it's not really coming from without!
The hills at this lower elevation are greening up fast, compared to what I saw climbing into the Smokies just three days ago. Once I drop below about 3500 feet a wave of humidity hits me. The Smokies truly feel like the rainforest they are.
I pass a girl named Crusher from Tennessee. She crushed a downhill to get the name, but she's not liking this downhill. Soon after that, the rain starts again. And it hits heavier than before. I'm in my rain jacket but neglect to throw the poncho over my pack, thinking my trash bag liner will keep things dry. It pours and pours. The trail turns into a swamp where it's flat, and the mud gets deeper and slicker everywhere. My shoes and socks take in water and become covered in filth. 
After a half hour of relentless rain I spy the shelter in a valley a hundred feet below. It seems to take forever to navigate switchbacks to get down.  I'm only the fourth person here, along with a yarmulke-wearing guy named Yellow Jacket, a trim guy named Wild Card, and a girl from New Hampshire named Granite. They all beat the rain, but I'm absolutely soaked. Worse, my trash bag liner failed and most of my stuff is wet. Thankfully the sleeping bag is spared. 
Eventually the shelter fills up. Some of them are familiar. Tin Can from Fontana marina, Crusher, Chandler (looks like the guy on Friends), Pindrop (fiftyish guy), Kiwi and Food Truck from last night, and of course Yellow Jacket, Wild Card, and Granite. UNICEF beats Fast Lane into the shelter for the first time. He was really motivated by the rain and broke out jogging. Clammy makes it too. No one is happy with the twenty-mile day or getting soaked. Tomorrow looks like a slow day.
Everyone is trying to dry out their stuff. Yellow Jacket builds a fire, and a clothesline is soon covered with a dozen pairs of soaked socks. The rain stops for an hour but returns with a vengeance. It stops again, then comes again, more furious than ever. We try to hang bear bags during the lull. This shelter is the only one that still has a chain-link fence in front, but food should never be kept inside. Unfortunately I snag my line on a tree and can't work it off before the rain starts up again. I'll have to work on it in the morning. I piggyback on Clammy's line, which is a weird variation of the PCT method we call the Mona Lisa because it seemed too beautiful to take down. 
Wumble and Morph make it to the shelter just as everyone has gotten in their sleeping bags. They grab the floor. Everyone is welcome in the shelter in lousy weather.
To my pleasant surprise I have cell service here, at least enough for data to check weather (rain, more rain) and post this journal. Voice support is much spottier. 
Hoping to dry out tomorrow, recuperate, and get to Hot Springs in a few days.","Pecks Corner shelter
",Davenport Gap shelter,"Apr 08, Mon",19.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610082,"What a storm last night! Must have had close to two inches of rain. It came in waves throughout the night, pounding against the metal roof of the shelter like a machine gun just two feet from my head. 
It peters out as the sun rises but will shower a couple more times before 10. Tin Can and Food Truck help me get my bear bag line out of the tree it caught in last night. They hold the small tree down to the ground Wile E. Coyote style while I work out the knots, then release it like a catapult.
I'm one of the last out. It's only a mile to the end of the Smokies, and four miles to Standing Bear Farm Hostel. I cross a flooding stream, tributary of the Pigeon River, four or five times, each time finding some unorthodox way to keep from submerging my feet. The last crossing I walk across a tricky wet log over a six foot falls and precariously support myself with one extended trekking pole against the rock face. Made it but not recommended!
Everyone from the shelter is headed to the hostel to resupply and dry out but Crusher. A local to western North Carolina, she's getting off for a few days at Max Patch to attend her brother's Eagle scout court of honor. Congrats to him!
Standing Bear is up a gravel road in a sunny hollow with a creek running through. It has numerous small buildings which are open air or have porches and gives the impression of a turn-of-the-century Appalachian village. There is a bunkhouse and two cabins: the two-story Treehouse, and one built over the creek. 
Boston Jack, with a huge white beard, greets me and gives me the tour. He's one of many old-timers helping out the owner, Maria. I spend four hours here, showering (and washing my shirt with me), resupplying, recharging my phone, drying out my tent on the second-floor pulley clotheslines, laying my socks and other wet stuff in the sun, writing postcards, and of course eating. It starts with a homemade breakfast burrito, and for lunch a cheeseburger platter with potato mash and green beans. Two meals, a shower, resupply and four drinks, only 27 bucks! 
I also collect pictures of some of the people in my bubble as we sit around the fire circle, so today is Picture Day.
I call home and talk with Sara and the kids. They spent the weekend on a scout service project, visited a fish hatchery, and went on a confirmation retreat. They got my package and named the stuffed bears Barney and Beary. I regaled them with my story of the wild boar. I love hearing their voices and miss them everyday. But I will see them soon.
There's a doctor's scale on the porch and I weigh myself. Down 9 pounds from the start to 174. Closer to fighting weight. When I summited Katahdin in 2017 I was 15 pounds lighter, so I have plenty of untapped calories stored.
In the kitchen I meet El Dorado, a young blond muscled guy with tattoos, who's kept to himself. Later I learn from Tiny that El Dorado finished the four pound burger at the fifties diner in Franklin! It's 35 bucks, or free if you finish it. He was the first to do it. He asked for a bucket near the end, but didn't need it.
Another new hiker is a young bearded guy named Mom. He's been here for 5 days waiting for a friend to catch up, but is leaving today.
Three guys drive in, former thruhikers doing trail magic in the area - Woodpile, Wet Sticks, and Crazy Korean. They stopped by our shelter yesterday afternoon with oranges and cowtails. Woodpile looks really familiar. He hiked in 2017 like me. I decide we must have met in New Hampshire.
Bubbles, Kiwi, Scrub-a-Dub and Scarecrow are staying at the hostel, the latter two waiting to be reunited with their dog Riggins who wasn't allowed in the Smokies. The rest of us are moving on.
On the way up the 2500 foot climb I meet Poetic Wanderer. He just got on at Davenport Gap and is going to Vermont. His blog/channel is advertised on his T-shirt. The next morning I hear he skeeved out the rest of the shelter by sharpening a wooden tent stake with a large knife and talking about unsolved murders. Weird guy.
Most of the crowd, including Clammy, UNICEF, and Fast Lane, stop seven miles in at the first shelter. They need a short day after pulling back-to-back twenties. It's a small but cozy shelter and not crowded, but Fast Lane has put into my head the idea of cowboy camping on Max Patch, a famous bald six miles away. No one else is game. I push on anyway. Adventure doesn't seek itself! 
I run into Morph and Womble. Morph left his expensive baselayer shirt at the hostel and is clearly bummed out. I realize I have Scrub-a-Dub's number so I contact him and he agrees to bring it to Hot Springs.
After more rolling ridge I climb up to Max Patch as the sun dips toward the mountains. First I see a film crew, with a boom mike, following a man carrying someone on his back in front of the sunset. As I climb I see a family playing frisbee, a bunch of tents, a photography shoot, and a bunch of hikers calling to me. It's Woodpile, Crazy Korean, and Wet Sticks with four thruhikers, grilling hot dogs and drinking beers. Wet Sticks is whooping it up as the sun starts to set. Someone from the film crew comes over to ask for quiet so they can get audio. 
The photography shoot features a guy in a Blue Man suit. They take pictures in different color suits at various locations as an art project. The crew joins us for a beer when they're done.
The sky cleared as I hiked up and now we are treated to a gorgeous sunset over the Smokies and foothills of Tennessee. The Bald is large and completely treeless offering a full circle view of mountains in every direction.
The thruhikers are new to me: Blue Eyes, a thirty-ish guy with unusually light blue eyes; Tripod, who carried a third trekking pole when his buddy Sandman fell and broke his other one and threw it in the woods (he was castigated by a ranger who didn't seem as concerned about possible injury); Sea Legs, a part-time Coloradan who owns a 36-ft sailboat; and Tiny, a fiftyish guy from Doylestown, PA who quit his job, talked to his wife, and hit the trail three weeks later.
Crazy Korean is a military brat whose mom is Korean. His parents opened a hair products shop aimed at blacks in Alabama. Now he works winters matching subcontractors with construction projects making good money to hike the rest of the year. Wet Sticks is a local and the wild man of the bunch. He was the last to hike out of a local wild fire in 2016 and got all over the local news with a story about rescuing baby rabbits. Guardian of the Vortex also shows up. He owns Rattle River hostel in Gorham, NH, finished the AT in 2016, and has been loafing around Central America during the off-season.
I finally recognize Woodpile. Not only did I meet him in 2017 but we actually summited Katahdin together! Along with Second Workout, Squatch, and many others. So another crazy coincidence to add to my AT collection.
I drink a little too much but we have a great time and still turn in around 9. The stars are out as the crescent moon sets so I leave the tent fly off.
Fantastic day!","Davenport Gap shelter
",Max Patch summit,"Apr 09, Tue",17.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610198,"The stars were out in force last night, though still no Milky Way. Too much light pollution from eastern Tennessee. Still, the starlight alone is enough to navigate the bald for a late night pee.  
I wake to the sounds of a group of tittering college girls nearby waiting for the sunrise and taking selfies. I join Tiny, Sea Legs, Tripod and soon Blue Eyes to watch the fiery sunrise over the western Carolina mountains. It is spectular. The colors change constantly, shadows and golden highlights play off the ripples in the western hills, while the hues of the silhouetted hills to the east make them look two-dimensional.
The price of camping on a meadow without a rain fly is condensation all over my sleeping bag and tent. Since I'm waiting for my friends to catch up, they get a few hours in the morning sun to dry out. There's a trail magic iced tea - unsweetened! - left over from last night so I enjoy that with an English muffin offered by Blue Eyes. 
I neglected to mention yesterday meeting Pocket Pussy, a hiker who carries a cat in his jacket pocket. When I met him resting on trail the cat was wandering around, looking as clean and nonchalant as any housecat. I learn today the cat woke up ill and he got off trail to find a vet. First cat I've ever heard of hiking the trail.
Around 10:30 Clammy rolls up from the shelter. It's too bad he missed last night, it was his kind of scene. We make a plan to go slow to Hot Springs today and tomorrow then zero Friday. The crew wants to recuperate from their back-to-back twenties. A day of town food and fresh laundry sounds good to me. By now I've decided pushing hard to make Damascus before Easter isn't wise and certainly wouldn't be any fun. Wherever we get to by next Friday, I'll need to return to later for a short final lap to Damascus.
Lunch is at Roaring Fork shelter two miles further. We work on our barbershop quartet harmony and lyrics to an ode to Jamie Lee Curtis yogurt. It keeps you regular...one of many inside jokes in our trail family.
I'm hiking less than seven miles today - 13 for my friends who didn't hike to Max Patch last night. This is my shortest day ever without coming out of or going into town. I have visions of pizza and cheeseburgers and need to be talked down from hiking the 20 miles into Hot Springs before dinner. It's a gorgeous day. Just enjoy being out in nature. You don't need to set any speed records. Sigh!
The clincher that keeps my food-motivated hiking in check is trail magic at Lemon Gap from a Bible study group at the Crossroads Community Church from Newport, TN. Hot dogs, grapes, oranges, chips, and tea! They've served over 40 hikers today, but are getting ready to leave, so I pack out two PB&J sandwiches, four oranges, and cookies for dinner. Which turns out to be fortunate as I later lend my fuel to Yellowjacket and it burns out after two minutes, so the dinners I packed would have been inedible.
We get up to Walnut Mountain shelter around 2. It's a lazy afternoon, arranging stuff, chatting, drying socks, gathering firewood. Eventually an old man hikes in, very slowly, with an old Kelty backpack, and two small dogs following him.
He's nearly deaf so conversation is hard. But we learn he's been hiking since 1949, has thruhiked the AT both northbound and southbound, as well as extensively in Japan, Korea, and the Blue Ridge. He must be 90 years old. His Chihuahua has two AT dog tags - one for each thruhike the dog has completed!
He keeps to himself in the shelter making dinner on a skillet while we gather around the fire. After twenty minutes or so he comes out and gives us a platter of grilled sirloin steak! And steak sauce to boot. I've already eaten my PB&J sandwiches but this is too good to pass up. And he tops it off by passing around cookies. He's just out for the night. It seems like he may be here just to be our trail angel. Amazing guy. I think he said his name was Bernard.
At the fire circle are Yellowjacket, Wild Card, Scrub-a-Dub, Scarecrow (renamed Go-gurt), Tin Can, Fast Lane, UNICEF, Clammy, and J-Stroke. The last is a NY/Boston native who loves paddling sports. Tenting nearby are NH natives Puke-y and Doc.
We walk up the hill to a meadow on Walnut Mountain to watch the setting sun. Riggins the dog still has lots of energy. Then into the shelter for bed. The two little dogs curl up inside the old man's sleeping bag.","Max Patch summit
",Walnut Mountain shelter,"Apr 10, Wed",6.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610210,"It's very windy overnight, high on Walnut Mountain. The shelter has lots of cracks so the wind cuts right through. I'm up early. The dogs stir in Bernard's sleeping bag. Clammy pokes his head in to say he's hiking out already. I follow soon, foregoing hot breakfast (no fuel anyway). 
It's 13 miles to Hot Springs. I cover it in four hours, mostly downhill, but starting with a 1000 foot climb up Bluff Mountain. The trail since the Smokies has been beautifully well-maintained. Few blowdowns, eroded trail, or rocky sections. As if to prove the point I run across Joe Myers, a volunteer with the Carolina Mountain Club, removing invasive plants along the trail. 
The morning is clear and warm and makes for a pleasant hike. I've gotten tan lines on my hands from my trekking pole straps thanks to two days of sun. I pass a few stealth campers. Mark, a thin middle-aged thruhiker who needs a trail name. J-stroke, who hiked out of the shelter just before dark to meet his friend hiking up from Hot Springs who didn't get as far as he hoped.
I catch up with Energizer Turtle, the Quebecois. He grew up speaking French but sounds like he's a native English-speaker. He credits watching lots of Seinfeld and Friends. He has traveled the 3 winter months each year for 24 years. For his 25th adventure, a thruhike, he started on his 50th birthday and will take as long as needed.
Further on is Andrew, who is unhappy with his trail name Doctor Farts, given by his friend Puke-y. I sense a pattern. He's a plasma cutter with Hypertherm in Lebanon NH, near  Dartmouth where I attended freshman year. He's looking to move to Asheville to escape the winters.
Soon the Broad French River valley appears below through the trees, dotted with farms. Rounding the hill, I see Hot Springs below, still 30 minutes away. Sounds waft up - barking dogs, lawnmowers, voices, chimes. It feels good to be walking towards town.
At the trailhead I shouldn't be surprised to see Crazy Korean and Guardian of the Vortex greeting hikers and passing out PBRs. It's the fourth time I've seen them in as many days. Apparently there was another gathering on Max Patch last night, a little wilder than ours with a younger crowd. But I bet they didn't have a blue man. Ha!
The Laughing Heart Hostel is right here and Tigger, a graying, cheerful woman shows me around. Shower and laundry are first on the agenda. Sea Legs just checked in and I piggyback on his laundry load while we sit around and, uh, drink beer. Sensing another theme here. Tripod is here, along with an Oklahoman named Tulsa Time, a vaguely Asian-looking small guy named Spruce Lee and his wife Shiitake (as in ""she-tawkie-a-lot"", named by her husband). Indeed she does.
Time for lunch at 2pm. I haven't eaten anything since sirloin last night (poor hiker!) The Smoky Mountain Diner has the cure. A 12oz burger with a pile of tater tots. Clammy and Fast Lane opt for the 20oz monster instead. I am, however, able to walk afterwards, a definite advantage.
Hot Springs is small, three or four blocks in the downtown. We walk to the river, crossing railroad tracks. Blue Eyes is walking towards us, tenting just north of town on the other side of the river to eliminate lodging costs. The Hot Springs Resort and Spa is by the river. Tripod plans to soak in the hot mineral springs. I agree to join him. But first we have to go get, um, beer, oddly enough at the tobacco shop. It's a very relaxing hour-long soak in 104-degree water piped from the natural spring into a whirpool tub in the open air. I get a little muscle massage from the jets and feel very relaxed afterwards.
The town is so small that everywhere I look I see hikers I know. Tiny is walking to dinner at Iron Horse, Energizer Turtle is chatting on his phone at the Welcome Center, two guys who gave us trail magic yesterday are eating on the deck of the Spring Creek Tavern. Crazy Korean and Granite are hanging out on a porch. No one has seen my tramily so I walk the mile to the hostel. No sign of them. Womble and Morph think they went to get a burger. Mark is here, and conveys a message that they went to Room 2 and I would know what that means. Huh? Then I realize they went to the Alpine Court Motel where Scrub-a-Dub and Go-Gurt are staying. I walk back to town. Knock on door #2. No answer, but door #1 opens briefly and slams shut. Okay, then on to the Tavern instead. Clammy has been eyeing their wood-fired pizza oven for the last two days.
Sure enough they're all here along with Puke-y, Doctor Farts, Yellow jacket, Food Truck, and soon Guardian, Crazy Korean, and Granite. I get the pizza, and it's just how I like it - thin crust, lots of cheese, and molten hot. But no beer. Enough for one day. Doc Farts gets a new name - Bash. Some Oregon Mighty Ducks reference. We hit Dollar General on the way back for dessert. 
There's a campfire outside the hostel when we return. A perfect log cabin-style fire courtesy of Spruce Lee. Aquaman is here. He fell in a creek trying to take a picture and UNICEF, master namer, baptised him. He's a muscled tattooed guy, but doesn't quite like the name. He wants it to be more organic, and is willing to wait 1600 miles to get the right name. To each his own.
Tomorrow was supposed to be a zero day. I've already arranged to stay at Elmer's Sunnybank Inn tomorrow night, where the owner is renowned for his gourmet vegetarian meals. And I'll be staying in Room 4, where the first thruhiker Earl Schaffer stayed during his 1948 thruhike. The guys are now talking about hiking a few miles out of town. That's not how I roll! Either I'm in town (eating), or I'm twenty miles down trail, getting closer to the next town. Hey, I y'am who's I y'am, as the great philosopher Popeye once said.","Walnut Mountain shelter

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610328,"Restful night at Laughing Heart. Our room has three twin beds and UNICEF is on the floor. I grab a shower and coffee and find Heather from Michigan bringing in trail magic in the form of watermelon, bananas, and oranges. She had also brought piles of pasta last night for those at the hostel. Her husband thruhiked in 2015 and received so much assistance she wanted to give back. 
I meet a couple new faces - Fuego, a young bearded guy, and Trotter a tall sixty-something woman, who is amused by my boy scout ""weather rock"" forecasting method (if the rock is wet it's raining, if it's white it's snowing, if the rock is swaying it's windy, if it's gone it's a tornado). Wild Card hikes in from the trail, having stayed just a couple miles outside town last night. He's meeting family tomorrow and slowed down so as not to arrive too soon. 
I find a pair of knock-off Crocs to use as camp shoes in the hiker box. I've always just loosened my sneakers around camp, but wet shoes make for unhappy feet, so I'll give these a try. I wear them around town all day.
The tramily has breakfast at the Smoky Mountain Diner with Scrub-a-Dub, Go-Gurt, Crazy Korean, and Heartbreaker. Most of the hikers I've seen in the last week are here too. A couple dozen packs are sitting outside from new arrivals. The huge skillet breakfast is popular, but I go with an overstuffed ham omelet and biscuit with brown gravy, both of which are good. Avoid the grits.
Over to Bluff Mountain Outfitter and Natural Foods for some resupply. Then back across town to check out of the hostel. Clammy, UNICEF, and Fast Lane are making noises about hiking a couple of miles out today, or maybe further. They don't feel like they need the zero day after all. But I've already mentally committed to not hiking today and reserved at Elmer's Sunnybank Inn tonight, so I carry my stuff over there, walking with Heartbreaker.
Heartbreaker is a young woman who started a thruhike but decided it wasn't for her and to just hike the parts she likes, hang out, and earn some money along the way. She's headed to Erwin with Crazy Korean. She feels guilty about not hiking every mile, but thruhiking isn't everyone's thing. There are lots of ways to enjoy the trail. Benton MacKaye, who envisioned the AT, never even considered the possibility of someone thruhiking it.
Scott aka Clipper (AT '18) checks me in to Elmer's Sunnybank Inn. It's a rambling Victorian and the oldest house in town, from 1840, with an historical marker out front (though no sign). I'm in room 4 where Earl Shaffer stayed during the first known thruhike in 1948, and again on his third thruhike in 1998. I'm sharing with Tin Can, who's also meeting family tomorrow. The house is huge and full of antiques and books. A parlor is used as a music room with an 1892 piano, banjo, and guitars for anyone with the chops to play. Elmer prefers you not use it for practice. Elmer is 82 and has been a minister, Duke University instructor, hiker, Buddhist, probable hippy, and chef among other things. He offers a renowned vegetarian dinner and breakfast. I successfully recruit Tin Can, Pukey, and Energizer Turtle to meet the minimum for dinner. Also here tonight are Pindrop, Bubbles, Tiny, Bash, and Kiwi.
Looking for my friends I stop by Scrub-a-Dub's room at the motel. He says they did indeed hike out of town, probably about ten miles. No problem, I can do a big day tomorrow and catch them.
Exploring the small downtown I visit Hiker Ministries Resource Center, open in thruhiker season for coffee, recharging, bathrooms, and conversation. A young mom named Ciara (like Sierra) and her adorable baby Ruby have cooked up a stir fry for two hikers - a girl named Two Blades and a South Korean who goes by Master Key. He started 8 days after me after thruhiking the 1000+ mile Florida Trail in 40 days in February-March. He's also done the PCT and CDT and remembers Clammy.
Hikers are hanging out around the town's Welcome Center to take advantage of their Wifi. Food Truck, Wild Card and others pass through. Inside I get steeped in local history. How Warm Springs became Hot Springs when they found a hotter spring, the two centuries as a famous spa and hotel in various incarnations, logging history, the old turnpike through the mountains that allowed Tennessee drovers to drive pigs down to Asheville, and the hotel's use as an internment camp for ethnic Germans during the Great War.
Lots of hikers are hanging out at the Tavern and I join them for a pre-dinner drink - Rick Flair, El Dorado, Chandler, Pukey, Caboose, Double Stuft, Crazy Korean, and Heartbreaker. Many just arrived and are staying above the bar.
Dinner at Elmer's is delicious and satisfying: soup, feta salad, tempeh lasagna, pie, all fantastic. Elmer always poses a question to his diners, in addition to your name, hometown, what you did before and will do after the trail.  Ours is which instrument would best represent you? Searching for something unique, I settle on the piano, an instrument I've always wanted to become proficient with which is versatile and brings enjoyment in any setting. More of an aspiration than a reflection, to be sure.
It's a zero day so a little evening entertainment is called for. Back to the Tavern for a live bluegrass/mountain band, then next door to play pool with the locals. I'm still in bed before 11. Tomorrow is a hiking day.","Hot Springs

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610413,"It's a cloudy morning so I sleep in until 7:22 (!) in Elmer's Sunnybank Inn. He's cooking up an amazing breakfast and we have a big crowd. Eggs, granola and fruit, grits, biscuits and veggie brown gravy, canteloupe and grapefruit. Question of the meal is what has surprised you most about the AT? For me, it's been how the AT is about more than hiking for so many people, and how many folks want to stay part of the community once they finish hiking, working in hostels or outfitters or being trail angels.
Time to start hiking. Only a chance of showers today. I run into some new arrivals I know while walking out: Marvel, the girl from Montreal, and P-nut, who remembers that I'm close to finishing and is excited for me. I say goodbye to Tin Can who is taking another day to meet his parents. He just heard he was accepted into the Peace Corps and will be going to Guinea in West Africa in November. I'm very happy for him. He's a talented and genuinely nice guy and will do us proud there.
I grab a postcard on the way out and run over to the post office to send it home. But they close at 10:30 on Saturday, so I'll hold on to it until Erwin.
I walk past the Hot Springs resort and cross the French Broad River, then amble along the river bank before climbing. A series of steep and rocky switchbacks pass Lover's Leap and several other outcroppings with views to town and the river. Lover's Leap goes back to legends of a Cherokee princess who supposedly met her end there. There are many such stories circulating in this region. 
Two women, Marshmallow and Tulip, are resting during the arduous climb out. I pass numerous dayhikers enjoying the AT and the many side trails around Hot Springs. It's Saturday and good weather so normal people are out.
One of the dayhikers looks really familiar. It's Fuego, who I met at Laughing Heart hostel. He's going the wrong direction and has nothing in his pack. He's excited because he bought new shoes, Keens, at the outfitter and they dropped him off to slackpack back to town to make sure the shoes worked for him. Wow, great service!
Tiny and Kiwi are on a break at a stagnant dammed pond. A firetower is coming up and Kiwi wants to spend the night in it. Sounds like a fun idea, but not in my plan today since it's only nine miles from town. Pocket Pussy passes by with his cat tucked into his jacket. The cat was feeling sick and he got off trail, but it's feeling better now.
Somewhere around here I pass 2000 miles on my AT hike. That seems like a long way, but I have so many good memories it takes some effort to remember all the hard work that went into actually covering those miles. I would make my own personal stick number 2000, but I'm in a bit of a hurry at the moment.
So my goal today is simple: to run down and catch up to my friends who skipped town yesterday. I am prepared to hike to the third shelter, 27 miles from town, if necessary. It would take til dark, but honestly I'm looking forward to it a bit to test the legs. They haven't had to do that much work since last summer.
Not far from the road crossing at Tanyard Gap I see a sinewy woman with silver braided pigtails walking her dog down the hill and talking on the phone. She hangs up and asks if I have any Advil. She says she fell, but landed on her dog, breaking her fall. She's concerned about her neck, but I'm more concerned about her disoriented behavior. I get her to sit down and drink water while I fish out ibuprofen from my pack. She's still talking a mile a minute, showing me scrapes on her arms, which are all superficial, and complaining about past neck injuries. We're close to the parking lot and there are many other hikers down there so I don't see a reason to keep her. She's just shook up and a little bit in shock. I catch up to Energizer Turtle in a couple minutes and ask about the lady. He saw her talking on the phone before she fell. 
A hiker coming down from the firetower is impressed that I still use a paper trail guide. He's Proteus, AT '05. I guess he hasn't seen thruhikers lately because he checks out my registration tag too. 
At the firetower I can still see the Smokies in the distance. I saw goodbye to Pukey and Bash here, who won't be going far today.
I pass Nobody (as in ""Nobody's tired!""). He's not sure he'll make it to Maine. Concerned he's too heavy. I tell him to take his time, it'll change slowly. He'll take it slow to Erwin, where his wife is meeting him in a week.
At the first shelter I check the log book but there's no comment from UNICEF, et al indicating their plans. Now I'm wondering if they're trying to shake me. Undeterred, I figure this merely calls for extra ribbing when I do catch them. Even if it takes until tomorrow.
Well, long story short (too late!), I finally get service at a summit and numerous texts pour in, including one from Clammy that they've stopped at the second shelter. Other texts are from our town stay when I had no service. It's an AT&T dead zone.
That means they're only twenty miles from town, and I'm an hour or so away. I had hoped they had hiked farther, but my body is tired from all the climbing, and I've been sweating and feeling the humidity below about 3000 feet. I also, like an idiot, have not been drinking nearly enough, getting by on about a half liter for twenty miles in my single-minded mission to catch them.
Aside from the climbing, the trail has been well-maintained and easy walking. I spy several new wildflowers, including what I believe is created dwarf Iris. 
Before 6pm I roll into Little Laurel shelter and find the guys occupying the shelter, strategically saving me a spot. This isn't good hiker etiquette, but my body isn't in a mood to refuse an easy place to crash. They've been here since 11 this morning. Two others are in the shelter and around ten others are tenting nearby. They had trail magic earlier, with people packing hot dogs, beer, and chocolate milk up in cooler backpacks. We enjoy some catch-up and joking around while I refuel my body and refill my water tanks.
Tomorrow looks like strong winds and rain and possibly freezing temperatures, so we're planning to hike early and avoid the worst of it.","Hot Springs
",Little Laurel shelter,"Apr 13, Sat",19.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610472,"The wind buffeted the shelter last night, pushing waves of rain under the eave and dampening our sleeping bags. I'm glad I slept with my head to the inside wall.
It's an early morning, and Clammy is raring to hike out to the next shelter before more rain comes. The forecast looks grim and the radar doesn't help. The other two guys in the shelter say they're staying put for the day, where it's dry and warm. One of them is called Mr. President. He was on Marine One staff for Presidents Carter, Reagan, and Bush, following them all over the world in a C5 transport.
Another thruhiker announces he's ""bailing out"" and hiking south (backwards) three miles to stay at Hemlock Hollow Hostel to wait out the storm. I don't say anything, but I can't help thinking ""No rain, no Maine"". You can't duck the weather forever.
Fast Lane, UNICEF, Clammy, and I all hike out separately. I'm dressed for rain, but other than a light drizzle for a few minutes it doesn't come. But man is it windy! It comes from the east mostly, and whips at me in great gusts when I am on the ridges.
There are two bad weather bypass trails today - a long one around Firescald Knob, known for its rock scrambling and long exposed ridge, and a short one around Big Butt Mountain's summit. I'm only aware of three other such bypasses on the southern AT: Blood in Georgia, Albert in North Carolina, and Clingmans Dome. Maybe this is a weather-prone area.
Not far before Jerry Cabin shelter I encounter a very strange sight: a Jeep with handicap plates stuck on the side of the trail on an uphill about a hundred yards north of a small gap, far from any road. It's wet, indicating it's been here since at least yesterday, with a pair of women's shorts hung from the bumper. There's also a roll of kitchen trash bags on the fender. Since I'm in need of a new trash bag to keep my gear dry I treat it as a ""trail provides"" moment and take one.
Aside from the Jeep incident, the area feels remote. There are several connecting trails, but no road crossings for at least a twenty mile stretch. Just a few woods roads, which are basically ATV tracks.
We all reach the second shelter, Flint Mountain, after 14 miles with very little rain. Tulsa Time is here, curled up in his sleeping bag. He thinks he ate some bad tuna yesterday and was sick to his stomach all night through the storm. He hiked a few miles here and called it a day. 
The other guys decide they're done for the day as well, though it's only 1:30. The forecast still looks ugly even though we've been lucky so far. It's supposed to drop near freezing overnight, so staying dry is paramount. I agree, so I plan to hike another three miles to Laurel Hostel to stay warm and dry. I dawdle, but there's nothing to do here, so I arrange to meet them tomorrow and hike on.
Of course Mother Nature wouldn't let it be so easy. A few minutes later the sky opens up and pours on me for the entire walk to the hostel. But as I arrive it relents, and the sun even peeks out.
Snowflake greets me. She's helping out at the hostel for a few days during her thruhike. She started January 31st as number 40. Along the way, through weeks of rain, she adopted a rescue pit bull in Hiawassee she named D'artagnan. She's been training him since while hiking, skipping the Smokies to avoid the huge kennel and transport fees. He's a friendly but very well behaved dog, and looks very healthy now.
Tim, the hostel owner, owns half the mountainside, 150 acres. His family used to grow tobacco but now he cultivates ginseng, which apparently commands $850 per pound and is frequently poached in national forests.
Two other hikers are staying, arriving minutes before me. Diesel is doing the Clingmans to Erwin section. He can only get two weeks off at a time from his work at the Arkansas parks service, where he heads their law enforcement division among other duties. 
Grasshopper, from Charleston, is about 70 and making a second thruhike attempt. In 2011 he made it to Massachusetts before hurricane Irene knocked out the trail in Vermont. He flipped to Katahdin then hitched home to SC, zeroing one day in Portland by taking advantage of an Occupy Maine protest to camp in the city park.
Grasshopper has details on the Jeep stuck on the trail since he was staying at the nearby shelter and saw the perpetrators. A local girl and her boyfriend borrowed her uncle's Jeep and, being more than a bit drunk, drove it up a forest service woods road to a gap then up the AT about a hundred yards into a rhododendron bush and got stuck. They stumbled over to Jerry Cabin shelter, looking dazed and disoriented, and having no food. The guy was seen trying to use a large branch to lever the Jeep back onto the trail, failing miserably. The girl dropped her ID before they ran off and Grasshopper picked it up. He reported the incident to the ATC. Not sure how they're going to get the Jeep out of there.
Laurel Hostel is very basic - a shack with six bunks, a shower, fridge, microwave, sink, and large covered patio with picnic table. The fridge is loaded with drinks and a freezer has pizzas, ice cream, and chimichangas, all of which I partake. There is no heat, the TV gets no reception, possibly due to the storm, and Wifi is spotty. I have no cell service, as usual. The storm whips up again in the evening. Snow is possible in the early morning.
Still, I am warm, dry, and safe on the AT. And Tim our host has promised to run us into Erwin for breakfast. So life is good.","Little Laurel shelter
",Laurel Hostel at Rector Laurel Rd,"Apr 14, Sun",17
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610605,"The bunkhouse at Laurel Hostel is unheated, so I can see my breath in the morning. It's lightly snowing outside. Diesel needs a ride to Erwin to get to his vehicle and end his hike early due to illness in the family. Grasshopper and I piggyback on the shuttle to get breakfast in town. Tim's son Paul drives us to Clarence's Drive-In, which despite the name is a normal diner, where I load up on biscuits and brown gravy, eggs, and a chocolate chip pancake. I have reliable service for the first time in two weeks and reach Sara at home. I love hearing what she and the kids have been up to. I love being out hiking but I miss them all so much. I'll be home later this week. 
Erwin/Unicoi is spread out along I-26 for several miles. Not at all like Hot Springs. I see a McDonald's for maybe the first time since Springer. I have to try their Bojangles when I hike into town tomorrow.
Back at the hostel Sandman has come by. Grasshopper and I are dismayed to learn our hosts want $20 each for the town trip. Most hostels shuttle to town for free or a nominal charge regardless of group size. Diesel already paid what an independent shuttler would charge for this short trip, so this surprise charge feels like gouging. Just another reason I wouldn't recommend this place beyond a stop for a soda.
I hike out at 10:30, knowing I'm already behind my friends who stayed at the shelter three miles back. It's cold and very windy but also mostly sunny, so depending on which side of the mountain the trail takes me I alternate between comfortable and frozen. 
Food Truck is at the first shelter I reach drying out his tent and sleeping bag. He stayed with Clammy et al last night and put a trash bag over the end of his sleeping bag to keep out the rain and sleet. But it just created condensation inside and wet the bag anyway. He says I missed the guys by 20-30 minutes, and they'll probably go past the next shelter because it's at too high an elevation and it's going to be a cold night.
So off I go on their trail again. Down into Sam's Gap, crossing my second interstate on this trip (I-26 here, I-40 at Davenport Gap). On the other side there's the remains of trail magic on a fence: empty plastic bags with a note saying ""PB&J - take one!"" Someone certainly did.
Not many hikers in this section. I meet a guy named Tee (like T-shirt) who is all bundled up against the wind and laughs too hard at my jokes. Also a section hiker just starting and heading fifty miles to Iron Mountain Gap. And two women thruhikers - Strider and a friend from Wisconsin who enjoys Nordic skiing. I later learn they had arrived at my friends' shelter last night after all six occupants were in their sleeping bags, and the Wisconsin woman impatiently demanded shelter space. Then in the morning she reprimanded them for not moving quickly enough. UNICEF was well-behaved and held his tongue but it was tough.
The wind continues relentlessly all day. I go over a ridgeline to Big Bald over 5000 feet and I can barely feel my hands despite the sun and nominal mid-40s temperature.
The trees about 4500 feet have iced over from last night's sleet. When the wind gusts through it shakes off pieces of ice and rains them down on me. At first this is kind of cool, then I realize they are sharp and I turn my head each time to protect my eyes. Not a hazard I expected on the trail.
Big Bald is exactly that - an expansive open meadow at 5500 feet. I can see the Smokies in the distance, and to the north an imposing snow-capped mountain which is probably Unaka. I'll climb that north of Erwin. The wind is whipping frenetically. Were it not for blue skies it would feel like a tropical storm. I yell into the wind and throw out my arms and embrace the chill. My phone shuts down several times while taking a picture due to the harsh wind.
It would be smart to stop and throw on hat, gloves, and rain/windjacket, but the violence and cold of the wind makes me feel alive. My body feels chilled but my mind is alert and loving it. I hike down to Bald Mountain shelter and learn from Doc and Chappy (Chaplain), two white-bearded retirees with big grins, that Fast Lane, UNICEF, and Clammy left not 20 minutes ago and think that I am much further behind. They're joking about hiking straight through to town, still 17 miles off. Doc and Chappy are fun to talk to, but it's almost 5 so I hike on to find my tramily. 
More biting wind, and three miles of downhill later, I reach Whistling Gap and find my friends along with several other tents. While we're now below 4000 feet, the wind is still blowing strongly and everyone just wants to crawl into their tents and cocoon. So I cook up some rice, borrowing back the fuel I lent Clammy last night, hang the bear bag and crawl into my sleeping bag listening to the wind roar.","Laurel Hostel at Rector Laurel Rd
",Whistling Gap,"Apr 15, Mon",19.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610633,"The wind calmed down overnight at Whistling Gap, and it does not seem it reached the mid-30s as forecast. No complaints here! Clammy's the first up as usual and his hearty greeting to a neighbor is our alarm clock. It's ten of seven. 
Today is town day - Erwin is thirteen miles off. I skip a hot breakfast and shove some snacks in my hip belt, knowing I probably won't touch them. Last out, I catch up with UNICEF near Spivey Gap and we hike the next eleven miles together.
The sun is warming us up, but the trail is easy and mostly downhill. We pass many hikers, both thru- and section, none of whom we know. One lady is named ""I'm Not Dead Yet"", or INDY for short (conveniently she's from Indiana). The morning passes quickly, until we start seeing Erwin about four miles out and are tantalized by its proximity for over an hour. Every turn away to follow the hill's contour is a disappointment, every bluff with a view to the Nolichucky River and town is a promise.
Finally the trail dumps us at a bridge over the Nolichucky where Uncle Johnny's hostel sits. We're just in time to hop the hostel shuttle to town, driven by Zoso (AT '17). Uncle Johnny, a trail icon, sadly passed away last year and his widow Charlotte runs it with the help of several ex-hikers.
Most of the van empties out at an all-you-can-eat pizza joint. Odie is walking by and chats. He's trail-famous for the Hiker Yearbook he publishes every year and can be found up and down the trail wherever most hikers are so he can get their photos for the yearbook.
No pizza for us, we're headed into downtown Erwin to the Super 8 motel, more economical than a hostel for four people and closer to more restaurants!
Eating is my first priority since I've had nothing all day. Higher than a shower. Sorry townspeople of Erwin! Bojangles is my target and Clammy joins me. I've been craving a Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich for a long time, and this is the closest I've seen. It does not disappoint. The girl behind the counter knows hikers and upgrades our fries for free, probably thanks to Clammy's charm. They sell a lot of ""tailgate specials"" to hikers, which is a ridiculous amount of food intended for a family for thirty bucks. The sandwich is enough for me. I feel like a piker.
A mile walk brings us to Food Lion for resupply. I need little. As usual I haven't eaten as much on trail as I predicted. Zippy is here, but is headed back to the trail to tent rather than pay the hostel. We walk her to the library then head back to the motel. The others have lots of bags, me just one. (No food + no water = ultralight!) Fast Lane buys mostly fresh food to stick with his healthy diet. Clammy and UNICEF try a different tack and hit Dunkin Donuts.
Laundry and movie time consume a few hours. Ready Player One is still a decent movie, if formulaic. (I know, move over Siskel and Ebert!)
I'm getting spring fever doing nothing, so UNICEF and I take an evening walk around downtown. We're on the wrong side of the interstate and railroad so it's a little sketchy walking alongside traffic to town. The main street is, predictably, dead at 7pm. Heading down a side street to peer through the (closed) outfitters' window, we discover the one open business, a bar. With a food truck outside! Hikers wave to us through the glass so we stop in. Spruce Lee, Shiitake, Sea Legs, Tulsa Time, and a skinny kid named Fat Bastard for his voluminous appetite are here playing the bar trivia tournament and waiting for the shuttle back to Uncle Johnny's. Spruce Lee offers the sparse remains of his Bojangles tailgate special. Impressive. He's another skinny little guy. A bar patron wanders over and offers us a shuttle back to the hostel for gas money, so we arrange a ride for tomorrow morning. More serendipity! I get a delicious burrito from the food truck and help team ""Hiker Trash"" maintain first place in the trivia contest. That is, until I whiff the president who was assassinated by Charles Guiteau. James Garfield. Duh! The leading teams are furiously Googling everything though. Not much skill to that, folks!
We slink out in defeat and circle the rest of downtown, passing four churches, beautiful blooming dogwoods, and many Victorian and Arts and Crafts influenced homes before our trek back to the wrong side of the tracks.
Game of Thrones is on at 10:30, way after hiker midnight, so it'll be a late night. Never seen it, but apparently it's popular?","Whistling Gap
",Erwin,"Apr 16, Tue",13.30
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610870,"Waking up inside is strange. It's still dark in the motel room but it's almost seven and I can't sleep any longer. So I dress and grab OJ, coffee, and toast in the lobby while the other guys rouse themselves. Morph and Womble are here, hoping to get to Walmart to buy hard-to-find earphones compatible with their iPhone.
I had made arrangements with a guy at the bar last night to pick us up this morning and take us to the trail, but I guess to no one's surprise he doesn't show. So I call Uncle Johnny's. While we're waiting I go out for last minute breakfast sandwiches at Bojangles and iced teas.
Zoso picks us up again. Uncle Johnny's is bustling with hikers coming and going. A guy named Tikka comes in and tells me I have lines under my eyes, same as last he saw me, so I must be tired. Also his trekking poles are falling apart and his pack is ripping. I can't get away from him quickly enough. Last thing I need when leaving town is a depressing conversation.
I hike out over the Nolichucky, bringing up the rear again. For the first few miles the hiking is pleasant, the weather is beautiful, and the woods feel familiar. But soon the first big climb comes, part of what will be almost 4000 feet elevation gain to today's high point, Unaka Mountain. It's hard to leave town - it's always uphill, your pack is full of food, and of course you're leaving all the comforts and conveniences behind for another four or five days in the woods. Everyone is dragging. Especially Fast Lane, who is sick to his stomach from something he ate yesterday.
Up to the first shelter for lunch and to Beauty Spot bald beyond, we leapfrog one another and many others:  Sea Legs, who lives on his boat in the Chesapeake, Spruce Lee and Shiitake, NOLA from New Orleans, True from Chicago, Fatty B (Fat Bastard), and 3 members of the Wounded Warriors thruhiking team. Every year they sponsor ten or so vets working out PTSD or other issues, equip and train them, and give them a stipend. They are paid to hike. The idea is, as WWII vet and first thruhiker Earl Shaffer said, ""to walk the war out"". I first encountered one of these vets, Matt, in Maine two years ago and I recall he was still quite bitter. This crew seems more upbeat and enjoying their hike. 
Stopping for lunch at Curley Maple Gap shelter I find a young guy named Mad Dog who I remember from Hot Springs. He is drinking a tiny bottle of apple-flavored whiskey. There are at least four empties lined up in front of him. Alcohol on trail is usually limited to trail magic beers or the rare shared flask around a campfire, always a social phenomenon. Pounding whiskey shots by yourself at ten in the morning denotes the same thing it would off trail. While I head out before Mad Dog, I later learn he hiked on and fell off the trail, rolling down the hill a bit. No injury, fortunately.
A few miles later at Indian Grave Gap we get unexpected trail magic from a Catholic missionary from Ohio. He and his dog Moses have been here every day since March 5th! Tea, lemonade, brownies, poundcake, and a camp chair make for a welcome break before climbing up to Beauty Spot.
Beauty Spot is a grassy bald with full circle views of the Blue Ridge mountains and back to Erwin. A dozen hikers are lounging here as a respite from hiking in the warm temperatures. Mike (formerly Aquaman) is among them, and still refusing any name that doesn't come naturally. He would like a clever name like She-talkie-too-much (Shiitake).
I could rest here a long time, but I now have a shuttle scheduled for my exit on Friday so I need to make miles. Clammy and I head up Unaka for what seems a never-ending rocky ascent with many false summits. Clammy reminisces about his PCT adventures. It sounds like a great experience, maybe someday I will have a chance to hike part of it. Eventually we find ourselves hiking through a cool, dark, quiet, green spruce forest over the summit. The last few miles to the shelter are mostly downhill and less rocky.
I had planned to go a few miles past the shelter to shorten tomorrow's hike over the Roan Highlands. But recognizing tonight may be my last night with my tramily I stay put and set up my tent.
I make dinner and eat with Fern, a woman from Rotorua in New Zealand's north island (where active geysers spurt out of the ground), and Burner, a girl who burned some dinners and melted some plastic before getting the hang of her stove. Burner was tenting at Jerry's Cabin shelter when the Jeep drove through. Apparently it didn't get stuck right away, but only after driving a mile down trail to the shelter, around it, and back, frightening her and her tenting neighbors. The two occupants then stumbled back to the shelter around three in the morning cold and hungry, thinking it was someone's house. The hikers gave them food and shelter space, but eventually the couple got scared and ran off.
UNICEF comes in a little later, but there's no sign of Fast Lane. We assume he stealth camped in a gap, feeling too sick to continue. Hopefully we see him early tomorrow. If he's like the other folks who have gotten sick recently, he will be over it quickly.
I make a campfire to while away the hour or so before sunset. Much of the fallen wood is damp or young so it takes awhile for the fire to be self-sustaining. Shiitake, Spruce Lee, Rocket Man, Buzz, and Downhill join UNICEF and I. The last three are new to me. It's past Clammy's bedtime so he's already horizontal in his tent. UNICEF breaks out a deck of cards he's been asking people to sign as a souvenir. I've already signed the Jack of Clubs (random selection) with the admonition ""Pete Best was better than Ringo"", a reference to my inevitable departure from our Fab Four.","Erwin
",Cherry Gap shelter,"Apr 17, Wed",17.10
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611052,"Several woodpeckers provide a wake-up call to the tenters at Cherry Gap shelter. No one slept in the shelter given its dingier-than-usual appearance, litter, and likely mouse infestation. Good weather made the choice easy. I even left the rain fly off my tent and had no dew.
Clammy hikes out early, as usual, with UNICEF and I scrambling to get going. Fast Lane must have stopped at a tentsite some miles back. We hope he's recovering from his stomach bug and able to catch up today. A number of hikers in our vicinity have had similar illnesses and felt better the next day. Whether giardia, norovirus, food-borne, or something else we can't be sure. 
The trail is relatively easy and UNICEF and I chat most of the morning through Iron Mountain Gap, where a blind curve highway presents a bigger danger than anything we've experienced in the woods, and over Iron Mountain's bumpy ridgeline to the Clyde Smith shelter for lunch. Along the way we pass Buzz, Rocketman, and Downhill collecting ramps (similar to onion) which they cook up for lunch with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper.
At lunch we get an updated weather forecast. The massive rainstorm expected late Friday has moved up a day and will now start tonight, dumping several inches of rain with wind gusts up to 55 mph. Finding a secure home for the night becomes a concern. My idea of camping on Grassy Knob Bald in the Roan Highlands seems unwise now.
My energy is flagging over the miles before and after lunch. The sun is out for the second day and the temperature is rising. I need to cover some distance today to get to route 19E by midday tomorrow to meet my shuttle so I can get home for Easter. So I resign myself to pushing through the miles. I'm fizzling out getting over Little Rock Knob. I catch Clammy. He says it's only a quarter mile down to Hughes Gap where we can rest by the road. I can make it...I think.
I don't want to say it, I don't even want to think it, but I really wish for trail magic and a cold drink. My body is crying out for something cold and something sweet. I banish the thought as soon as it comes - bad karma to wish for gifts.
But even so, there is a car down in the dirt lot with its rear hatch open and a lady bringing out a cooler. She smiles as I come down the trail and asks if I'd like a snack? There's only one answer to that - Yes, ma'am! I'm her first customer and she just got here so she offers me the pickle jar while she bustles with other boxes. I shrug and open it and practically swallow a pickle whole. Then she asks if I want strawberry shortcake. Taken by surprise, I quickly remember there is only one right answer. She fills a cup with shortcake, fresh sliced strawberries, and whipped cream. It's amazing! Cold and sweet, everything I need! I have two, along with sodas, an orange, and cheetos. My fellow hikers soon catch up and everyone shares the love. Our trail angel's name is Kansas, an AT thruhiker from 2015 who now lives in Raleigh. She's also section-hiked the Mountains-to-Sea Trail which runs from Clingmans Dome to the Outer Banks.
Here I learn that Rocketman and Buzz are married, and that Downhill is Buzz' mother. Thruhiking was her idea and she convinced her daughter to join her.
Re-energized, I tackle the 2000+ foot climb up to Roan High Knob. It's steady and relatively easy uphill for the next three miles. I'm singing Cat Stevens songs for much of it (""If you want to sing out, sing out! If you want to be free, be fre-ee.""). By 5500 feet elevation I've reentered spruce forest similar to Big Bald or Clingmans Dome. The trail is mostly rocks and boulders up here.
Roan's summit is anticlimactic with no sweeping view. Instead there are multiple side trails leading to the site of the old Cloudland hotel, a nineteenth century resort. There is little to see but an historical marker. The parking lot beyond it looks like a ghost town. Tumbleweed blows across the lot (okay, spruce branches). The bathrooms are locked, water fountains shut off, even the trash bins are locked so I can't dump my food trash. The tourist road to the summit doesn't open until Memorial Day.
I catch up with Clammy and UNICEF at Roan High Knob shelter. We are the only ones here. It's an enclosed cabin with a door and a sleeping attic that could easily fit 15 people. There is a pile of novels to while away the time. It looks like a perfect place to ride out the storm in comfort. But it's also seventeen miles away from the meeting point for my 1pm shuttle tomorrow. I have to cover more miles today. So this is goodbye to my trail family.
We sing one last song, unfortunately without Fast Lane. Hopefully he will find them later this evening. Then a quick goodbye, with a promise to stay in touch and maybe some trail magic when they pass me in Pennsylvania.
I have seven more miles, and it's over some lovely Balds with incredible views. The wind has been picking up all afternoon, and it is positively roaring across Round and Jane Balds. I have to plant my feet carefully to avoid being toppled while I walk in some places. The horizon is covered by mountains in every direction, in layers of blue, light blue, and purple. To the east there is a much higher and imposing peak I take to be Grandfather Mountain, one of the highest in the East. To the west I see small settlements nestled in the valleys of Tennessee.
Coming down to Stan Murray shelter I find three older guys ready to spend the night. It's a standard small box and unfortunately appears to be open to the direction of the wind. They are planning to set their tents up inside to stay dry. I'm moving on to the much larger, and enclosed, Overmountain shelter.
Overmountain is a bit off the trail at the head of a beautiful valley. It's an old barn and it's jammed with hikers trying to stay out of storm. Close to 30 people are laid out in the hayloft meant for 20. A dozen more are tenting in the open ground floor. Two brave souls are tenting out in the field in the full fury of wind. A 2017 thruhiker named Blaze hiked in earlier and left a case of beer, so someone greets me by handing me a Bud Light. I go upstairs and after several minutes poking around an old guy named Snowcream moves his stuff over to make me a spot. It's out of the rain, and out of the wind, so life is good!
To my shock, Spruce Lee, Shiitake, Rocketman, Buzz, and Downhill arrive an hour after me, matching my 25-mile day. I expected them to stop at Roan High Knob. I needed to do these miles to reach my shuttle. They did it because they felt good. My feet are aching! They wind up tenting in the passage under the loft stairs.
The wind is raging outside and the snoring concert has begun inside. But I am happy to be warm and dry.","Cherry Gap shelter
",Overmountain shelter,"Apr 18, Thu",24.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611332,"The Overmountain hayloft is a refuge in the storm. The wind roars angrily throughout the night, bringing heavy showers. Come first light the 28 or so refugees up here begin to stir. I dress and pack and climb down to eat breakfast. It looks calmer outside than it sounds upstairs, and the rain has momentarily slowed. But the wind is still strong and blows out my stove. Twenty minutes of protection from the shifting gusts is needed to get a boil, and with it some oatmeal and tea. 
The first few brave souls head out across the meadow towards the trail. We can see sheets of rain falling over them. It seems like a great day to stay put. But the storm system will take a couple days to pass through and most people are trying to get to one of the hostels at route 19E, almost ten miles away. One tramily of seven is lucky to have phone service and gets Mountain Harbour hostel to meet them at a blue-blaze trailhead a mile below the shelter. But whether one mile or ten, no one's staying dry today.
I have my own reason for hiking into the storm. It's almost Easter, and time to head home to my wife and kids. This is the end of a 400 mile section. I miss them, and I'm not going to let a little rain stand in my way! I'm meeting a shuttle at 1pm to take me back to my car in Abingdon, Virginia, so I can drive the 500 miles back home to Pennsylvania. It's going to be a long day.
I throw on a cap, rain jacket and rain mitts, and pull an emergency poncho over me and my pack for good measure, then hike out. Before I even cover the quarter mile back to the trail, everything exposed is wet. And I'm still under tree cover.
Most of the next five miles are not.
There are officially only two balds in this stretch, Little Hump and Hump Mountains, but the trail is mostly exposed from the point I rejoin it at the shelter side trail. On a good day this would be a pleasant stroll in the open air with majestic views around every turn. But today the wind is whipping, driving the rain into me like sleet. The trail is a river, gushing with rivulets and waterfalls over every rock. Where it is flat, there are puddles and ponds dozens of yards long.
My ""Oh well!"" moment comes early on when I reach a small pond covering the trail with no rocks to hop or any way around. My feet are not going to stay dry today. In I go! If you can't beat it, at least make it fun! Some of the puddles are deeper than I expect. But each time, within seconds of clearing the water, most of it has drained from my shoes and my wool socks, though drenched, feel warm again. Days like this are why ""waterproof"" shoes are a bad idea on the AT. They keep water in better than they keep it out.
Hiking in the open below the bald summits is drenching and slippery but not intimidating. Up on the balds, though, the wind is in charge. It drives the rain sideways into my face and arms like countless daggers. The gusts sometimes change direction and catch me off guard. I have to dig in before lifting each foot lest I lose my balance. The trail is mostly a muddy river with little traction. I almost go down more than once. Thank you trekking poles! Hiking on the slick grass is slightly more secure. The wind gains more fury as I approach the summit. Despite the tempest I can see nearby mountains through the rolling mist. And I can see the bald continuing on and on. 
While it's no walk in the woods, I'm enjoying the challenge and the experience. I've hiked through many kinds of rainstorms, but few of this power. On Saddleback Mountain in Maine I memorably crossed three miles of treeless alpine bedrock in what felt like a tropical storm and was rewarded with hypothermia. I'm better prepared today, and it's slightly warmer. On the other hand, my rain mitts have already wetted out, my pants are soaked, and only my $1.50 poncho has prevented my much pricier rain jacket from failing as well. Short of a hurricane, the only thing that could make this storm more interesting is lightning.
Uh, oh. Now you've done it.
No sooner do I think it, when a flash catches my eye and thunder splits the sky a second later. I'm in the middle of a grassy field at 5500 feet with nothing taller than a twelve-inch rock around me. I immediately pick up my trekking poles and hold them horizontal to prevent them from becoming lightning rods. But that just makes sliding through the mud and grass less stable. Lying down in the pouring rain is not an attractive option, and won't get me out of harm's way. So I slip and slide to the tree line as fast as the mud will allow. It's a long half mile, with several more flashes to remind me why I'm hurrying.
Below tree line the trail has more fun in store - rocks, boulders, roots, rivers, puddles. The hillside is a sieve with torrents of runoff pouring onto the trail, and running with it a ways before finding an outlet. Every innocuous spring and stream is now a raging river bursting across the trail. I alternate rock hopping and sloshing through the muck as conditions require. It's a pleasure to rinse my feet in the clean streams of runoff, only to drop them once again in a muddy pit.
A final open meadow at Doll Flats, complete with lightning, leads to a sign announcing the AT is finally leaving North Carolina for good, after 300 miles or so, most of that along the Tennessee state line. Thirteenth state done!
Eventually I catch up with Buzz, Downhill, and Rocket Man as we descend a rock-strewn slope and boulder staircase. I am drenched everywhere, even under the poncho, from sweat and wicking. My fingers are numb under my rain mitts. So much for that innovation. I want to take pictures, but each one requires removing a mitt, taking my phone from its protective pouch with fingers that move like molasses, trying to avoid soaking the electronics, quickly twisting the phone to enter camera mode, trying it again with a wrist that moves far slower than it should, fighting the wet screen to register my touch and capture an image, then carefully placing the phone away and pulling on and fastening a drenched mitt over numbed digits. What normally takes ten seconds now takes several minutes.
As the elevation drops the trail becomes less rocky and the runoff more controlled. It's been channelled into a roaring creek that yesterday was probably a quiet stream. It floods tentsites near the trail. No good stealth spots here. The trail itself is still a stream but by this point it's the easiest walking I've had all day.
There's one last foot soaking to wade through the drainage area below Route 19E before climbing to the road. Traffic is light but steady and roars by quickly. I haven't seen cars move this fast in weeks. I've agreed to meet my shuttle at the Station at 19E, a hostel/brewpub advertised as 0.4 miles east. I've had no service for days therefore no way to confirm the ride, so I start walking and hope for the best. It takes a good while at a very fast walking clip and feels more like a mile. The gravel parking lot has largely been washed away by active gushers of runoff. I wade through more water to reach the door. I seem to be the first one to arrive through the storm, and carefully peel off my outer layers before entering. The owner, Dave, finds me on his way out to pickup hikers at the trailhead (cell service would have been nice!), and asks me with great concern if I have a reservation. They're full for the night and he doesn't want to turn me away. He's visibly relieved when I assure him I'm just here for food. 
Dave is not only the owner and driver but also the cook (and chief bottle washer perhaps). So while I wait I have some liquid grain. It takes several painstaking minutes to extract the cash from my pack with still-numb fingers. A few hikers who stayed last night are eating turkey legs. I have almost an hour so put in a lunch order. But after Dave's frequent shuttle runs delay the preparation I dial it back to just an order of wings. Meanwhile I chat with a thruhiker named Thoreau from Pittsburgh about identifying wildflowers, hiking with kids, the bluegrass band that played here last night and more, while hikers from Overmountain pour into the place.
It's nearly one and my ride, a guy named Uncle Mike, has appeared but my wings have not. Dave conjures them up just in time to take out, an hour after I arrived. They've been very busy, though I watched several people finish turkey legs they ordered after me. But beggars can't be choosers! The wings are delicious and I'm thankful to have been out of the rain.
Uncle Mike is a white-bearded Kentucky native who's made a home in Bristol, Tennessee for many years. He's been a coal miner, school janitor, amateur historian, gardener, hiker, and probably more that I missed. He likes helping hikers, and people in general. One young hiker needed to get home for his grandfather's funeral. After he started counting out change to pay the shuttle to the bus depot, Uncle Mike told him to put it away and bought him the bus ticket home.
We drive past Hampton, which is practically on the AT, then through Bristol. Bristol has a lovely old train station and is trying to get Amtrak to extend its Roanoke line through Bristol to Chattanooga, Atlanta, and Birmingham. Some hotels are going up in old warehouses. At one time Bristol was a rail crossroads similar in importance to Atlanta today with air travel. It sits near the southern end of the Great Valley that runs through the Appalachians the length of Virginia and Pennsylvania and into New York, connecting the seaboard with the inland and Mississippi valley.
Soon enough we're in Abingdon and I'm back in my car. There's a set of civilian clothes in the trunk. I peel off every article of clothing, every last bit of which is soaked. Funny, it didn't feel that wet until I took it off. Wonder of wonders my car is just as I left it and starts without issue. Once the brakes loosen up I'm good to go.
It's 500 miles back home to Pennsylvania, mostly along I-81. I'm following the arc of the storm system and driving through heavy rain on and off. My first stop is in Christiansburg for Chick-fil-A. The AT runs through a Chick-fil-A desert, one of the major design flaws in Benton MacKaye's vision.
The rain lessens as I head north. It's after midnight when I reach home. Everyone is asleep. I will reunite with my family in the morning. 
Another section complete. Only 75 miles remain...","Overmountain shelter
",Route 19E,"Apr 19, Fri",9.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611838,"I'm heading back to the trail to finish my final section, Route 19E to Damascus. Just 75 miles and I'm done. Hard to believe. Left home at 6:30am and have a shuttle lined up from Damascus to 19E at 7pm with Uncle Mike so I'll have some time to hopefully surprise the guys I was hiking with.
Green is creeping up the mountainsides along I-81 in Virginia. Above 3500 feet the trees are still not in leaf. I stop for lunch in Salem outside Roanoke, then decide to detour by way of Lickskillet hostel where I stayed last year. It sounds stupid, but there's a short section of road walk I missed because my host Mongo picked me up at one trailhead and dropped me off at the other. It's been bugging me since. I'm the guy who exits a shelter on the same path I entered to avoid missing a few feet. 
So I meander on backroads through the New River Valley and isolated little valleys with cows grazing in the meadows. I walk the 200 yards on VA608 between the trail heads, laying a hand on the white blazes at each end as a way of bonding this into my hike. Then I drive the mile down to the hostel.
No one is here, but it looks the same as last summer and just as tranquil. As I'm leaving a note a car pulls in and I step out on the porch to greet Mongo and his guest. Mongo remembers me - our tire blowout and my frozen midnight ribs atGarden Mountain hostel are hard to forget. And it was Mongo who named me Midnight. Garden Mountain hasn't improved much. Just last week a girl called from the trailhead for a ride, they said they were on the way, but didn't arrive for four hours. But Mongo is still living his dream - he earns a living by hanging out with cool people and he credits God for showing him the way. I'm happy for him.
Back to the interstate, I get cell service again and find a text response from UNICEF that they just passed Elk Garden to enter Grayson Highlands. I don't know whether they'll hike through to Massie Gap, the next road access, or stay at Thomas Knob shelter. If the latter, I'll have a four mile hike both ways to find them. They undoubtedly lost service after passing Elk Garden so I'll have to take my chances.
I hit Ingles for trail magic supplies: oranges, strawberries, blueberries, Cokes, and donuts. After a couple thousand miles I think I know what hikers crave. Then I try to make good time to Massie Gap, but it's an hour away over backroad route 16 that winds over the mountains. I'm stuck behind a Walmart tractor trailer much of the way - but there's no Walmart for a hundred miles in that direction so it's some strange shortcut.
The final stretch on Route 58 is even windier with dozens of hairpin turns over a few miles. Finally I reach Grayson Highlands state park and Massie Gap. Cars are parked everywhere. There's a big charity walk ending here. The walkers hiked 30 miles from Damascus today and are celebrating with pizza and beer at the trailhead. 
I hike past the pizza party, determined to make it the four miles to Thomas Knob in an hour. Otherwise I'll be late for my shuttle. And of course I have no service to warn Uncle Mike. But soon after I reach the AT from the side trail I hear ""Valley!"" from up the trail. It's Clammy! He's a welcome sight, and saved me a lot of extra walking.
Food Truck is with him, who I thought I'd never see again. He's the new Ringo. I approve. Couldn't have made a better choice.
I lay out the spread and Clammy scarfs down donuts. Supergirl stops by, who I hadn't met before, then UNICEF, Downhill, Buzz, and Rocket Man show up. Reunion of all my favorite hikers!
Since I last saw them they hiked through the Good Friday storm to Overmountain shelter where it was again packed. When they reached Damascus they hitched over to Abingdon to stay in another Super 8, eat at Taco Bell, then walk next door to Wendy's immediately after. They all seem pretty happy with the way it turned out. But they have no new songs for me! 
Fast Lane never shows up, but he did recover from his stomach bug. Apparently it's still making the rounds among hikers. J-Stroke, Taco and two guys I've never met appear and finish off the trail magic. After packing up and seeing off my crew with a promise to catch them again on my way home, I end up driving the other four down to the General Store, cramming all five of us and our packs in my Audi sedan.
It's time to book for Damascus and my shuttle. Thirty miles of the incredibly twisty route 58 stands between us. It's like Dragon's Tail near Fontana, beloved by motorcyclists for its two hundred curves over fourteen miles, except twice as long!
After an exhilarating ride and a little white-knuckling I reach Damascus and scan for Uncle Mike's car. Fortunately he's sitting right on the main drag of this small town. I park and we don't about an hour to Mountain Harbour hostel. A hiker/trail angel has brought in donuts and shares his frozen chimichangas so I make up for the dinner I missed in my rush.
Also here are a tall girl named Sweet Tooth who I met hundreds of miles ago, a fiftyish guy named Gumby who swears we met, a career hiker named Gypsy, and The Colonel, a thirty-year Army vet thruhiking for a second time, and his visiting wife Maryann. The Colonel was hospitalized for an ankle issue and later for a kidney stone during his last hike. It took over seven months. He's looking to do this one in five.
It's been a long day, time to rest.",,View Entry,"Apr 27, Sat",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611916,"I'm up at 6:15 in the Mountain Harbour bunkroom loft. What a comfortable bed! The sun is definitely rising earlier. I grab a shower and head up to the main house for their famous breakfast. 
Our hosts do not disappoint. The spread is amazing, and all homemade. Pancakes, biscuits and gravy, eggs with veggies, ham and sausage, fried potatoes with bacon, some kind of egg soufflee, red velvet cake, strawberry pastry, fruit, and more that I don't recall. I pile my plate high and get seconds. There are twenty diners between those in the bunkhouse, tenters, and regular B&B guests.
I chat with a section hiker named Watson who has stayed here each year since 2012. Also a hiker named Gypsy with a pointed graying beard, his parents gave him the nickname for running off as a kid for days at a time. He's thruhiked twice, and now spend most of his time hiking, mostly on the Florida, Pinhoti, and Appalachian trails.
A clutch of youth group leaders come in. I mistake them for boy scout leaders, but their church has moved to a group called Trail Life which is much the same. They have 25 boys on a high adventure hiking trip and are here to mobilize the shuttles to go pick them up. Don't tell the boys about the buffet breakfast though!
I head out to the trail with the sun shining. Very different from the fierce storm I left in a week ago. Shortly up trail I find a gray-haired thruhiker named Mosey. She's ending her thruhike today because she missed her family and 16 grandkids too much. But she wants to hit the 400 mile mark first, so she's hiking with her husband and young grandson on this last leg. ""I'm thruhiking!"" her grandson exclaims when I ask what he's doing. ""I did a lot of training!""
I pass Peregrine and his girlfriend Baby Bear while climbing a green meadow with a beautiful view back to the Roan Highlands. I met them over breakfast this morning. The weather is relatively cool and partly sunny, great for hiking. The trail is easy with minimal climbs and goes through a mix of meadows and woods, even alongside a creek for awhile.
I meet a young girl named Ninja from Colorado after crossing a grassy ridge with views both to Roan and to the mountains in the north. She's hiking with Puck Carrier, who I met back around NOC. He's from Boston, retired from food processing, a hockey fan and casual player, with 13 and 19 year old daughters. I hike with them the rest of the morning as we take in the beauty of Jones Falls, and later take hiker showers in Mountaineer Falls. Which was quite refreshing, as the sun poked out at just the right time.
They introduce me later to Genius, a hiker from upper Ontario. I don't know if he's a genius, but he sure talks enough to say something smart once in a while.
Puck and I come across Sweetwater, who I stayed with at Mountain Harbour. He's slackpacking south thanks to a lift from his hiking partner the Colonel who is taking the day off to tour the area with his visiting wife. Sweetwater runs a charity called Sweetwater Outreach. He works with villages in Kenya and Tanzania to fix wells that well-meaning groups installed years ago but no longer work due to lack of local know-how. The villagers have to take responsibility by forming a committee with majority women (who are the primary water users), raising five dollars for the replacement O-rings that are usually the only fix needed, and getting trained on how to maintain the well. Education is the key according to Sweetwater. Infrastructure isn't enough. Amazing guy. Says it all came together after asking God what to do with the rest of his life after thirty years in construction engineering.
At the Mountaineer Falls shelter I relax and snack while admiring the three story sleeping platforms. Then Puck walks in with a concerned look on his face. He tells me a guy is headed this way who had an altercation with Ninja last week. His demeanor says to be on my guard.
A shirtless, very disheveled, young guy with long dirty blonde hair comes in. He calls himself Sovereign, but also throws out a bunch of alternate names. He immediately makes things awkward by mumbling things to himself, demanding that we answer his questions and refusing in advance to answer any we may have. He has a pit bull with him with a sign saying ""service dog"" and tells us not to pet her. He calls her Pickles, but then later Felicia. When I ask if one is a trail name he says she has 74 names and a thousand multiple personalities. He proceeds to scribble odd pictures all over people's notes on the shelter's grafitti board, and insists we sign into the shelter log. He demands our names so he can log that we didn't sign it. He then proceeds to sweep the dirt floor in front of the shelter, and pick up trash like a plastic bottle and throw it into the fire ring to be burnt. He makes a few side comments about conspiracies and spying, then offers some tidbits on his sketchy past in Boston when Puck starts talking Patriots football with him.
He seems mentally disturbed and off his meds. Last week he was actually arrested back near Sam's Gap for threatening Ninja with a shovel (kept at some shelters for digging cat holes). But she didn't want to press charges and get publicity so he was released. He didn't seem to recognize her today, thankfully. 
We're hoping he plans to stay for the night so we can hike ahead, but soon he decides to hike on, taking a fishing pole someone left in the shelter as his trophy. We are left with the conundrum of how to avoid seeing this guy again. Puck, Genius, Ninja, and I agree to stick together, and we certainly aren't leaving Ninja by herself. 
Gina and Belch hike in and get the story. A young married couple from New Jersey, they started March 6 but had to step off for three weeks due to shin splints. Some trail angels in Asheville who read their blog offered to put them up the whole time and slack packed them for several days as they recovered. They even sent them new shoes once they were back on the trail! Amazing kindness. I remember meeting the couple when they were slacking southbound near Sam's Gap south of Erwin. They saw Sovereign this morning at route 19E and heard about his arrest through relatives who read a news clipping.
Baby Bear and Peregrine from Mountain Harbour hike in and join us. We all plan to stay together and tent in the same place tonight. Safety in numbers. Sovereign's erratic behavior has put everyone on edge. There are plenty of eccentrics and freethinkers on trail but this guy is a different order of magnitude. Puck calls the sheriff's office, not to report a crime but to update them on the odd behavior and create a record of where he was in case it's important later. 
Groove and Sweet Tooth hike in and join our group, which is still trying to figure out a plan. Groove and Sweet Tooth (who was at Mountain Harbour last night) were both hiking with Ladypoles and the other Misfits when I first encountered them after the NOC at Sassafras Gap shelter. The tramily has since broken up. The Scottish guy Four went back to Scotland, Caveman left the trail due to his Achilles heel, and Ladypoles and Three (a British guy I believe) are lagging back in Erwin.
I decide to hike out. It's been two hours since Sovereign left and it's almost 4. Our plan is to go to a tentsite eight miles out, but before the next shelter where we think Sovereign will end up. Belch and Gina follow and the others should be coming soon. I had mentioned an upcoming hostel to Sovereign, who seemed very interested, so he may get off trail there if we're lucky.
Shortly after starting out I run across No Rush, a curly-haired muscled young guy, and two girls Rocky and Bullwinkle. They heard the story from Peregrine, who had situated himself at the shelter trail intersection to warn passers-by, and are trepidacious about encountering Sovereign. They're taking a break to give him plenty of time to get ahead. I offer to take point and move on. By this time I feel like we may be giving the guy more credit than he deserves. In any case, I'm not going to live in fear of him.
Two Swiss hikers are camped near a footbridge. They thruhiked last year and are redoing one of their favorite sections while visiting friends in US. They've chosen a lovely spot at the confluence of a stream and the creek that the footbridge crosses. The man reports they saw Sovereign (they met him a few days ago) and his dog heading north looking for a hostel.
At Forest Service road 293 Gina and Belch catch up with me. It's a clear shot to the town of Roan Mountain from here - three miles downhill, less if we get service to call a hostel for pickup. They have milkshakes in town at Bob's Dairyland. Tempting. Verrrry tempting. We go back and forth for a little. After all we're trying to avoid Whackadoo, as Belch refers to Sovereign, up ahead. But eventually I acknowledge the inevitable and hike on and they follow. Tomorrow we'll pass close to Hampton and can walk into town for lunch.
I reach a tentsite where Beast and Gumby have set up. I met Beast back before Hot Springs, and he's since been hiking with Puck and Ninja. He's lost 42 pounds since starting the trail. They saw Sovereign go by heading to the next shelter, having failed to find the hostel. He told them he had no food or water. And even more oddly, he had two dogs this time, a husky as well as the pit bull. Where the husky came from no one knows.
I finally reach another tentsite a mile past Hard Core Falls. Belch and Gina, and later Groove and Sweet Tooth join me. Belch and I make a little fire as we cook noodles. When I ask over the campfire what brought them to the trail, they talk about thruhiking the Long Trail in Vermont a couple years ago as a great experience and how Belch has long talked of hiking the AT in the future. But the real reason they are here now is the tragedy that befell their family near the end of their Long Trail hike. I won't go into details out of respect for their privacy, but thruhiking is a way to step out of the painful reminders in their day-to-day lives. It is also hopefully a catharsis that allows them to process what they've been through. Everyone has a reason for being out here. I'm grateful they shared theirs with me.","Route 19E
",Tentsite at mile 412.7,"Apr 28, Sun",17.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611957,"I'm up with the birds at 6:30 at the tentsite. It's chillier than I expected, around 45 degrees. There was a clear sky and plenty of stars last night, at least beyond all the trees. Late in the night I saw someone hike past the tentsite.
Gina, Belch and I breakfast and plan a side trip to Hampton for lunch at the side trail past Laurel Falls. Our evening goal is tricky because the Watauga Dam shelter 18 miles out has been long closed due to bear activity, but the only closer shelter is only nine miles away. Boots Off Hostel near Watauga Lake looks like the best option.
Early on I meet Trigger, a 63-year-old former Marine and Boston boy hiking south from Harpers Ferry. He'll flip back to Harpers to hike to Katahdin. Behind him are two true southbounders, a man and woman who started last June, got off at Daleville near Roanoke, Virginia for the winter, and got back on April 2nd. 
All three stayed with Sovereign last night and aver he was acting as anti-social and erratic as we witnessed. He told them he was off his medication and asked for food so he wouldn't have to go into town. They also claim he punched the husky.
Mr. President, the former Marine One guard, is still at the shelter when I arrive. He called the sheriff's office to report Sovereign and tells how Sovereign hid the husky's dog tags to prevent anyone seeing the owner's name. Mr. President and Trigger, both ex-Marines, slept very little, with trekking poles at the ready in case anything happened. Meanwhile my late night hiker stopped at this shelter. He goes by the name High Mileage. He confronted Sovereign in the morning about his history and took the husky from him before hiking out. Sovereign later followed and is not far ahead of us now.
I finally get signal on a hill and answer texts and emails and post my journal for the last two days while several people hike past. Moving on I catch up with Beast and hike with him for awhile. He's from New Jersey and on leave from a twenty-year career as a mechanical engineer in water treatment applications. He's thinking of going independent in consulting when he gets back. He's got a ten-year-old son at home who wants to finish the trail with his dad when he gets out of school in June.
Suddenly we hear Ninja ahead making a commotion. Not sure whether she's laughing or being attacked, we hurry down and find she almost stepped on a five foot snake. But we don't see it. Too bad our snake (and bird) experts Peregrine and Baby Bear aren't here.
Down at Dennis Cove Rd we find an incredible trail magic setup. Sisters Spice Girl and Tough Cookie (AT '17) along with their mom and dad and dog Blaze are from Lexington, Kentucky and have set up by the creek for three days to do trail magic and give back the kindness they received. Dad, a cabinet maker for very high-end retailers nationwide, is cooking up hand-formed smashburgers on a huge portable fryer. Two of these with cheese, bacon, onions, pickles, soda, beer, chips, brownies, cookies, hard-boiled eggs, oranges, and leftover pancakes from breakfast sate the hiker hunger for awhile. And just as I'm about to leave they offer me a bona-fide mimosa! Not what I thought I'd be drinking today when I woke up. When the Jim Beam comes out I know it's time to go.
Lots of hikers come through while I'm here. Safety First, another ex-Misfit, Groove and Sweet Tooth, Mr. President, Beast, Ninja, Belch and Gina, Peregrine and Baby Bear, Puck, Genius, even The Colonel, whose wife has gone back home - everyone I've met in the last two days. Except Sovereign. He caused a lot of commotion while he was here earlier, drinking so much that our host had to cut him off and give him a stern warning. He begged not to be kicked out. Eventually the owner of the nearby Black Bear hostel drove Sovereign into Hampton to get food, after giving him a shower and clean clothes. He doesn't return in the two hours I'm at the trail magic. (Has it really been two hours?)
Finally tearing myself away, I enter the lovely Laurel Creek canyon. High rock cliffs loom over the roaring creek below. In places the trail has been blasted through knobs of rock rather than running over them. Surely this must have been an old roadbed. Too much trouble for a hiking trail.
The mountain laurel are starting to bloom. The purple flowers soften the stark stone cliffs as I cross the creek several times on footbridges.
When I reach Laurel Falls, Gina and Belch are just leaving after an hour-long foot soak. It's been a hot couple miles and I'm ready to cool off. I whip off my shoes and shirt and wade over the rocks into the bracingly cold water. The bottom rocks are too difficult to navigate to get all the way out to the falls, but I take a brief dip before drying out in the sun. 
The trail winds along the creek for another mile, at one point hugging a rock face with a narrow footpath inches from the swirling waters. Past the Laurel Fork shelter the trail heads up, up, up some 1800 feet over the next couple miles. It's a good, sweaty climb, but bittersweet for me. It looks like the last challenging climb before I finish the AT in Damascus. I've been through countless ascents, some very memorable, others blur together.  But climbs make the trail worth hiking. The views, the exercise, the challenge, the feeling of hitting your limit, and then digging deeper to reach the summit. I've had some choice words for some of these climbs in the past, and they don't always reward you with views, but I wouldn't trade any of them for an easier trail.
The climb is well switchbacked and never very steep. It ends at a place called Pond Flats, which is neither flat nor has a pond. In fact it looks like many other summits in the south. The downhill is continuous with good tread, so I take the opportunity to call home and talk with the kids. Surprisingly service is quite good on this side of the mountain. I love hearing their voices. This time it's only a few days before I see them again.
At the bottom I turn up Shook Branch Road toward Boots Off Hostel. Their van rolls in from the road and Jim, the owner, gives me a lift up his gravel driveway. I only have two thoughts on my mind: a cold drink and a ride into town for dinner. After considering the a la carte costs of a ride and a shower, I decide to tent here tonight. Twelve dollars covers it all. I set up the tent on a flat dirt platform down the hill from the kitchen and shower.
Jim drives me and Gumby, one of only two other guests, into town, picking up Gina and Belch on the way. Dollar General for a minimal resupply, Subway for dinner, McDonald's for second dinner, and Brown's Grocery for a fuel canister. I meet the owner, Sutton Brown, at Subway where he's brought a hiker who's staying at his own hostel in town. The talk turns to Sovereign the crazy guy, who some have been calling Machete after an incident where he apparently threatened someone with one. All the stories have by now disseminated across social media. Sutton tells us Sovereign did indeed come into town today, but eventually got picked up by the sheriff. He called it an arrest, but who knows. In any case Sovereign doesn't seem to be coming back to the trail today. 
Jim has to get back to the hostel but Odie, a trail angel who follows the bubble and publishes the Hiker Yearbook, takes over and shuttles us in the converted school bus in which he lives. Odie has talked to Bob Peoples, owner of the local Kincora hostel (and long-time trail maintainer whose legend is larger than life - Bob Peoples gives boots blisters! Bears hang food bags for Bob Peoples! Bob Peoples checks the permits of Smoky Mountain rangers! Mice bring Bob Peoples food!). Bob managed to reunite the husky recovered by High Mileage with its owner. So at least some damage this guy has been wreaking is being repaired.
Some more folks have arrived late to the hostel. Foundation, a lanky guy who hiked over 30 miles from route 19E today; Safety First, from the trail magic; and Grasshopper, who I stayed with at Laurel Hostel before Erwin. Grasshopper is much happier with the accommodations here. He's also sporting a new walking stick, having accidentally dropped the one he's carried for the last four hundred miles into Laurel Creek today, where the trail hugs the rock wall. 
Another day filled with twists and turns. The AT constantly reminds us that it is much more than a walk in the woods.","Tentsite at mile 412.7
",Shook Branch Rd / Boots Off Hostel,"Apr 29, Mon",15.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612022,"I sleep in til 7 (!) in my tent at Boots Off Hostel, until I can't ignore the birds any longer. They provide a breakfast of cereal, fruit, coffee, and donuts. The store, in which the towels are kept, is locked, so no shower this morning. Last night it was so popular there was no hot water. No biggie, I'll take a dip in the lake later.
A grey-haired Alabaman named Partly Cloudy is in residence and cooks up excellent barbeque for hikers everyday. He owned a construction company for many years building hundreds of homes a year, but when he retired he sold both the business and his house and is currently living in a tent here for the season feeding hikers. He even built himself a deck for the tent. He says he just enjoys meeting people from all walks of life, and is happier here than any other retirement pursuit he can imagine.
I'm the last guest to hike out. The trail runs by the Watauga Lake swimming beach after several minutes. No one is here on a Tuesday morning and no hikers are behind me. So I go skinny-dipping to keep the shorts dry. A partially submerged concrete picnic table conceals me from route 321 traffic. The water is cool and dark and the bottom is sandy. Very refreshing. I try to scrub all the dirt off my body. As I dry out in the sun I observe two geese watching over their flock of a dozen fuzzy goslings foraging on the shore.
The lake's water is high and the trail is temporarily rerouted to avoid the shoreline. But of course I follow the white blazes anyway as they wind along the lakeshore within feet of the water. Most of the swampy areas are bridged and I only have to skirt a couple of puddles. 
This section of the trail is also in a restricted area of no camping or picnicking thanks to frequent bear activity. Fisherman apparently leave tempting appetizers behind them. The Watauga Lake shelter is still standing but is scheduled for removal due to the bear activity. A log still smolders in the fire ring. Someone camped here just last night despite the ban.
The trail continues to follow the lake until it reaches the Watauga Dam. While not as impressive as Fontana, and mostly made of earth and gravel, it contains a comparable body of water. I don't think the trail will come close to another large lake until New Jersey. 
At the other end I catch up with Grasshopper. I admire his tenacity in coming out to do the whole trail again. He doesn't consider himself a thruhiker because he had to skip hurricane-ravaged Vermont. He's a tough old bird and doesn't take guff from anyone.
I've been trying to catalogue new wildflowers as I see them. The mountain laurel are now blooming all over. And I've seen two purple wildflowers that both have five petals and similar serrated leaves. One flower has a foot, though, and alternating leaves. The other has no foot, but symmetric leaf formation. The first is dwarf larkspur and the second is wild geranium or spotted crane's bill. They are not even closely related, going by the Latin names. The variety nature offers is astounding.
While climbing up to the Iron Mountains ridgeline I meet Mountain Fish, a young man with straight hair and southern accent, named for swimming the trail upstream on a rainy day. While getting a ride to the trail this morning he saw Sovereign walking by the road. But he was headed towards town. It's a little concerning though that he's on the loose again. 
I catch up with Timber, a dark-haired young guy who tented at Boots Off. He's finishing a 400 mile section in Damascus. He has no interest in hiking the whole trail, he just wanted to come out and center himself for a month. What he really wants to do is fix up an old Jeef Cherokee and drive the Pan-American Highway.
Along the ridgeline, with frequent views of the lake, I pick a ramp to cook for lunch. I hear they taste like onions and garlic. Rocketman had tried some a couple weeks ago. So I slice it down - the stalk looks like a green onion - and fry it up with butter offered by Timber. It's awful! It tastes extremely bitter. Mountain Fish agrees. I have to spit it out it's so bad. Now I'm doubting this is even a ramp. I look up ramps since I have service. No, it wasn't a ramp at all! Total fail. Gina later calls her father, a botanist, and he identifies it as a mayapple. Properly chastened, I'm reminded of the age-old wisdom not to eat anything in the wild you are not certain of. Gina would name me ""Ramp"" if I didn't already have a name. I'll add it to the list!
I stop at Iron Mountain shelter for dinner. Gumby is the only one here. He's retired and lives in Bethel, Maine with his wife very close to the trail, but he's never been a big hiker. When he retired he told his wife he needed an adventure, that puttering around the house wasn't enough. His first choice was a stint at a scientific station in Antarctica. When that didn't come through, he headed for the AT.
Gumby saw Sovereign by the dam this morning, asking where the northbound trail was. He thinks the guy is headed to this shelter. 
So when Belch and Gina catch up I decide to follow them a couple more miles to a stealth site. It's not a regularly used site so we have to clear out the sticks, but it's flat, comfy, and has views of the sunset and sunrise. It's clear tonight as well. 
On the way we passed a stone monument to a local hermit called ""Uncle Nick Grindstaff"" who died in 1923. The monument simply lists his name and dates and says ""Lived alone, suffered alone, died alone."" That's definitely not the AT motto. This mountain may have once been a solitary retreat, but today it is part of a highly social community.","Shook Branch Rd / Boots Off Hostel
",Stealth site at 446.2,"Apr 30, Tue",17.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612140,"The predawn light and eventually the birds pry me awake and out of the cocoon of my sleeping bag and liner. I thought I heard animals near the tent during the night, but it may only have been Gina up for a midnight pee. In any case Belch and Gina are hiking out around 6:30 while I'm still struggling for full awareness. The soft duff under this virgin stealth site was very comfortable. Since the first week of this section I haven't had back or joint pain from sleeping on my thin foam pad, but last night was almost like sleeping on a mattress.
I catch up with my partners an hour or so later at Tennessee route 91. This begins a long pasture walk which is the only section of the AT advertised as handicap-accessible. It includes a graded dirt ramp up to the meadow from the parking area. The pasture makes for a great distraction from the usual forest scene, with sweeping views across rolling fields and distant mountain ranges.  At one point we diverge from the trail and find ourselves walking parallel to but not on the trail. I apologize to Gina and Belch as I hurry back to redo the walk on the trail proper. I'm too close to the end to slack off now. They completely sympathize, and in fact were about to do the same themselves. Hitting every white blaze isn't as popular as it once was, but for me at least it feels right. I'm here, I'm gonna hike the trail as it is.
At Double Springs Gap shelter we find The Colonel and Sweetwater taking a break. They're planning to hike 25 miles to Damascus today. Unusual for two older guys to be in such a hurry. But The Colonel is intent on finishing in 150 days to best his thruhike from two years ago when he had medical issues, and Sweetwater is intent on finishing for his charity. Many supporters have pledged some amount per mile if he finishes and signed well wishes on his pack. Belch, Gina and I are planning only to get close to Damascus and hike in tomorrow morning. The Virginia state line looks like an attractive compromise, several miles south of town. We are content because we plan to hitch into Shady Valley for lunch at the next road.
At US 421 a fifty-something couple named PB & J are taking a break. They're hiking southbound from Waynesboro, Virginia. They are very upbeat and cheer us on as we try to hitch on this lightly traveled road. The first car passes with a wave. Many minutes later the second car stops, and PB&J cheer wildly. Out trail angel is Amber, a young girl from Bristol, Tennessee who's out for a scenic drive. She gives us a lift the three miles into Shady Valley.
Shady Valley is just a small crossroads with a restaurant and a general store, but that's enough! At the restaurant I order a Shady Burger, BLT, and cheese fries with a ham sub to go for dinner. Last evening my stove stopped working. Thanks, I believe, to debris shot into it from my new fuel canister. Another stove worked just fine immediately after with the same canister. The tiny stove served me well for 2000 miles, but it was only a ten dollar BRS-3000 so I can't complain.
Gina notes wryly that restaurant patrons say hi as she passes to use the restroom. This is not like New Jersey or Pennsylvania, where people avoid eye contact with strangers.
Properly fueled, I wander over to the General Store to load up on cold drinks. I try Cheerwine for the first time - a less fizzy cherry-flavored cola - and it is delicious. This store is mainly a biker (motorcyclist) stop on US 421, known as ""the snake"" for its 489 curves over three mountains. They advertise non-ethanol gasoline: venomous (93) and non-venomous (87).
It's been a couple hours in this tranquil crossroads but now it's time to return to the trail. Problem is we hear a lot of birds but very few engines. Hardly a car passes, and almost none are heading toward the mountains.
Finally a gray-bearded guy in a pickup with AT stickers stops. At first he seems to be messing with us, acting like he doesn't know we want a ride, but with a window full of hiker stickers I'm confident we are in. Eventually he hops out and opens the tailgate. I climb in back with the packs. His rear seat is taken up with rifles so Belch and Gina squeeze in front. He makes a U-turn and heads back to the hills, six miles out of his way.  
Our driver is Phoenix, also known as Ropes, a Scranton native who's hiked Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey. He just moved to Shady Valley with his wife and bought a 34 acre spread. We seem to be the first hikers he's picked up down here. With the trail so close he's considering doing more to support it. I tell him jokingly Tennessee could use some privies.
At the trailhead, married couple No Worries and Hot Buns are hanging out.  Hot Buns got her name by lighting her new Patagonia jacket on fire. No Worries is familiar, I've heard his name and seen his bright orange beard before. If they weren't hiking they say they'd be touring around California in a Sprinter van.
There's very poor water sources over the next section. Belch scoops water from a puddle, but I take a hard pass. Instead I end up hiking a quarter mile down a steep hill (and back) at the next shelter. But both sources are at least clear, unlike those I've gotten in New Jersey in summer.
We keep hiking. The trail is easy with gentle ups and downs over the ridgeline and few rocks. Blue mountains fill the horizon on both sides. The sun flits in and out of the clouds. We come to a structure marked as a ""disused"" shelter. It's a three-sided log cabin with a small platform built for two and a rolled up tarp on the front. It's apparently an emergency shelter known as the Holiday Inn Express, but we call it the Love Shack. It has clearly gotten plenty of use, even with no water source.
I hike ahead, and as the miles fall away I decide I'm going all the way today. I'm going to finish the AT in Damascus. My feelings are very mixed, and I don't quite know how to process them. People keep asking how I feel about finishing. A strange question. How does anyone feel about finishing something they love? A sense of accomplishment, perhaps. Pride, maybe. But it is also an ending. An ending of something that will never be the same again. Part of me wishes it were not done. But there is much to celebrate.
I arrive at the Virginia border and leave a note for my companions whom I'm sure are camping here, along with more water since it's a dry site, and the ham sub I've carried for over ten miles. It's the least I can do. Belch bought me lunch today. Tomorrow I will drive them wherever they need to go before heading home. They've been good friends. 
I calculate my hiking time while descending the last few miles into Damascus. I figure my sections have had me on trail for 120 days, a tad under four months, over the last two years, though some of those days involved very few hiking miles and a lot of car or train travel. That includes three true zero days, but not the weeks and months I've been at home between sections with Sara and the kids. In fact it includes weeks of hiking with my kids in Shenandoah and Pennsylvania. All in all, an average of 18.25 miles per day, far faster than average. If I were to do it again, I would not try to do it as quickly. I've enjoyed my more spontaneous and relaxed hiking style in this last section immensely. I've made good friends and wonderful memories. Life is not meant to be rushed. 
I enter Damascus near the library. My car is still there, untouched. I grab my civilian clothes from the trunk and stuff them in the pack. When I reach the arch welcoming hikers to Damascus, I pause to take a picture of a pebble I've carried more than 300 miles. I have not mentioned it until now. Near the Fontana marina, before the Smokies, there was a boot filled with pebbles, and a sign with a request from the widow of a hiker who died of cancer before he had a chance to experience the AT past that point. The request was to carry a pebble up the trail to whatever is your destination, so that her departed husband might symbolically experience it. I take a picture of the pebble in front of the arch to send to his widow, then place it under a bush by the arch where thousands of hikers will pass over the coming years. Similar pebbles have no doubt made it to Katahdin and many other points. A fitting tribute to a man who loved the trail. 
I walk the final half mile into town around the park, observing small town life - a man mowing his lawn, kids swinging on the playground, teens gathered for a pep talk on the basketball court, couples out for an evening stroll, a neighbor helping load a truck.
I swing around the train car at the entrance to Laurel Avenue, Damascus' main street. Another block brings me to the town hall. This is the end. This is where I started my section from Damascus to Daleville last August. Two thousand, one hundred, and ninety-two miles. I lay a hand on the fresh white blaze on the telephone pole by the street. I didn't think I would get emotional, but I have to lean my head against the pole. I pray to God for strength for my family and myself, I thank Him for the health and fortitude and opportunity to finish this task, and I pray for Him to reveal my path in good time, that I may honor Him, be true to myself, and do what is right. It's several minutes before I can compose myself and move on. 
I find High Mileage at the next corner, about to retrieve his car at the end of his own section. He saved the husky from our troubled friend the other day, and I thank him. I hope that hiker finds some peace and a better way in the world.
At Hikers Inn I check into the bunkhouse. Honeybee and two others who were at Boots Off trying to aquablaze the Watauga River are here, along with a section hiker named NASA. I offer dinner to celebrate but no one is hungry. After a shower I head to 7 Trails Grill. But along the way I see Odie's bus parked in front of Crazy Larry's hostel and tell him my good news. Foundation is also here, from Boots Off, and he joins me for dinner. 
In the middle of my Buffalo Chicken pizza and Devil's Backbone lager, Belch and Gina walk in. They decided to hike in after all! They are staying with a hiker who they helped in New Jersey, but I ply them with food before they leave with takeout. 
Foundation is an interesting kid. Twenty-four, a tall and lanky college dropout with short brown curly hair, he loved skateboarding before he started hiking, and has hiked pieces of many trails, including thruhiking the Arizona, Colorado, and Pinhoti trails. He talks reverently of being in flow when he's hiking, a trait he ascribes also to yoga and skateboarding. When he has reached his potential in an activity he is no longer interested in it, whether it be school or skateboarding. He's not there yet with hiking. He attempted to do three 30-mile days in a row this week but missed by a few miles. I suspect he will try again soon. But he's also content to work at his father's pizza restaurant in Portland, Oregon between hikes. He described it happily as work that requires little skill, only speed. It, too, has a sense of flow. 
I grab some beers at the gas station on the way back to share with my hostel mates. Paul, our host, joins us after delivering my laundry. He thrued in 2010 as Skink, a quirky character from a novel by Carl Hiasson. He's orginally Flemish (Belgian) from near Bruges, and bought the Hikers Inn with his wife during his thruhike and has run it continuously these last nine years. He enjoys hiking and biking the area, and is familiar with the Pyrenees and other European hiking trails. Damascus to him is a wonderful town because of the people who populate it. There are dozens of former thruhikers here.
That's a fitting end for the last day of my hike. Tomorrow I'll be doing trail magic for as many of my trail friends as I can find before heading home. And hopefully soon I will have some closing thoughts on this journey.","Stealth site at 446.2
",Damascus,"May 01, Wed",24.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612674,"My hike may be over, but my work is not. I plan some trail angeling and trail magicking today. After ordering a modest breakfast sandwich at the Damascus Diner that turns out to be enormous (Damascus knows hikers!), I take my leave of Paul at Hikers Inn as well as fellow hikers Tribute, Dynamite, and Honeybee. Tribute is about thirty years the senior of the younger couple and refers to them as his ""trail kids"". Their tramily had a fourth member, Snowbird, but he wanted to hike faster and left them a week or so ago. I say I'll look for him up trail.
I promised to ferry Gina and Belch anywhere they needed this morning so we meet at my car by the library and head to Walmart in Abingdon. I'm stocking up on trail magic necessities: soda, beer, fruit, donuts, pastries. Gina and Belch are just looking for their best resupply in 150 miles. 
I drop them back in town at Mount Rogers Outfitters, where I find a white blaze shirt in medium size (hidden among lots of xx-small and xx-large). The grizzled proprietor and his companions congratulate me. I wish Belch and Gina luck until they reach me in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile I can follow them on YouTube at ""It's who we are"".
I follow wriggly route 58 back into the Grayson Highlands, heading to meet Scrub-a-Dub and Go-Gurt at the Scales, a picnic area with parking that used to be a cattle auction yard. I haven't seen them since I walked out of Hot Springs without saying goodbye, thinking they were ahead of me. But the road to the Scales turns out to be 4x4 only! It's six miles away - no hiking in with trail magic this time. Without cell service, I can't coordinate a different location. So I head a half mile to the trailhead on VA 603 (but 5-6 miles by trail from the Scales)  and leave a bag of drinks and oranges on ice with their names on it. I don't like to leave it without knowing whether they will get it, and whether someone will dispose of the trash, but I don't want to leave them empty-handed. Later in the day, with cell service, I hear from Scrub-a-Dub that they did get it and loved it. Like Gina and Belch, I ask them to look me up when they get to Pennsylvania.
Determined to do some successful trail magic I head towards Bland. I have cryptic text messages from UNICEF and Clammy this morning about eating at Brushy Mountain Outpost, a small diner on route 52 where the trail crosses north of Bland, with the intention to hike eleven more miles to Jenny Knob shelter tonight.
Where can I intercept them? VA 608 is a mile past the shelter, and I'm not dragging coolers a mile from the road. The only other crossing after 52 is VA 611, marked as a gravel road in AWOL's guide so I don't know if it is even passable. Plus, it's only eight miles from Brushy Mountain Outpost. If they got there at ten this morning as the texts indicate and stayed for an hour, they will probably pass 611 as early as two. I'm not going to reach the crossing until ten after two. Will I miss them?
611 is hardtop when I turn off from route 42, and doesn't turn to gravel until a half mile from the trail. It's very passable and very quiet. A Virginia DOT truck is taking up the trailhead parking area. Two workers have been resting here for awhile. I offer them sodas, which they pass on, but they give me valuable information before driving off - no hikers have passed since they arrived. If that's the case my tramily must still be on the way. Successful interception!
Man, I didn't realize trail magic was so complicated!
After setting up chairs, coolers, and food, I check the weather again. It was blue skies as I drove across southwestern Virginia, but dark clouds are on the horizon. Radar shows a thunderstorm cell to the north and another two hours to the west.  Looks like we lucked out for now.
I hang around for twenty minutes, then get bored and decide to walk in and meet them with a handful of oranges. Almost half a mile in I run into Brass Compass, a middle-aged guy who is back on trail after a couple days off. He doesn't know my pals and has only seen one hiker today. I give him an orange and tell him to magic it up at the road. I find the lone hiker he saw a few hundred yards further in - Zig is a big hairy guy trying to reach Pearisburg before noon on Saturday (today is Thursday) to get a package before the post office closes. It's about 35 miles away over easy terrain, not a big obstacle at this point in his thruhike. But he's stressed. He knows Clammy and the rest - he's been hiking with them for two days and they're still behind. He got up at 5am to reach Brushy Mountain Outpost for breakfast. The others weren't quite as ambitious. I give him an orange and send him to the road. 
Finally I give up trying to find the crew and hike back to the road. But ten minutes later Clammy appears! His long-sleeve shirt is drenched in sweat and I get a smelly hug. He hasn't showered since Damascus, eight days ago! Not a thruhiker record to be sure, but much longer than earlier in the hike. And the humidity is just beginning. 
Food Truck hikes down soon after. He seems to be enjoying his new tramily, though like Fast Lane he leaves most of the talking to Clammy and UNICEF. Still waters run deep.  They've just passed the 600 mile mark - almost exactly 100 miles since I last saw them. Don't expect trail magic every hundred mile mark guys!
It starts to drizzle. No worries! Radar still shows the thunderstorm is to the north, so this is just the edge. Clammy doesn't like the look of that cloud though. Suddenly the rain strengthens. Then it pours. For twenty minutes. Huh! Who woulda thunk the weather could be unpredictable in the mountains?
Clammy asks if he can sit in my car. He's already shoving his pack in the trunk. Food Truck joins him. I throw on my poncho. A British guy named Dead Cat stands stoically with me in the rain, grinning like a Cheshire Cat, and helping me cover the donuts. Fast Lane hikes down while it's pouring. Fast Lane! I missed him when trail magicking in Grayson last week, and he was sick and trailing behind for two days when I left them on Roan High Knob the week before. He looks good, and he fully recovered after a day or two. He still sports his signature green sparkly bow tie. He even met the girl who left it in the hiker box back in Franklin!
The rain stops as suddenly as it began. UNICEF finally appears, unperturbed by rain and in his usual wry mood. He's had some shin splints recently and always feels rushed, but he's still at it and always has a joke and a smile. Not going to let a bunch of old guys out-walk him! Hope you're reading this my friend! You got this!
The guys have been clocking lots of 20+ mile days this week, dropping into Marion and Bland for resupply but sleeping on trail to save money. Hence the no showers thing. Today they hitched into Bland and immediately got an offer for a ride back. The guy offered to wait, but they rushed around getting their resupply and town food. The trip into town explains how I caught them here.
The skies open up for a second time, radar be damned. Clammy is in the car almost before the first drop hits. It's 15 or 20 minutes before it tapers off. Donuts are still good!
Maybe ten other hikers pass through. UNICEF refers to Zig as Creatine because he drinks the muscle-building powder for calories on trail. Dead Cat is from Bristol, England. A few days ago a bear ripped down his food bag which was hung PCT-style and ate all his food. He thinks the bear jumped off the picnic table to reach it.
Cephus (Aramaic for stone) is named for a character in a book he wrote for his sixteen grandchildren. The guy doesn't look over sixty. There's a tall French girl named Sticks, another girl named Chow Hound, and a short blonde girl named Vik (Viking). Then there's a young grizzled guy named Pink Paws Solo (pink paws for the pattern on his gaiters, and Solo in reference to his equipment failing him as regularly as the Millennium Falcon). He's already done the 24/24/24 challenge on his way into Damascus. That's 24 miles in 24 hours consuming 24 beers. Not recommended by your doctor, the ATC, or any sensible person. 
Finally there's a German kid who looks about 6' 4"" and is really moving (and can really eat). Before he leaves I remember to ask his name. Snowbird, he says. Snowbird! The missing member of Tribute's tramily. What are the odds I run into him the same day 130 miles away? He is surprised, and sounds a little proud, to hear his old pals are way back in Damascus. In fact he's already left a second tramily so he could hike faster. He'll be on Katahdin by the Fourth of July at this rate. 
It's farewell time again. Everyone has three miles to the shelter and it's late in the day. They're wet and sweaty and facing three more days of storms, but they all leave smiling. Most of them will be in Pearisburg in two days, for a well-deserved shower!
The 24-pack of beer is gone, along with all the fruit and donuts but for a few oranges. They are few, but they can eat! And drink!
It's nearing sunset and I head home up I-81. My eyes droop and I pull off at a rest stop near Harrisonburg to sleep in the car. Home tomorrow for sure...",,View Entry,"May 02, Thu",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612687,"I slept fairly well at the rest stop north of Harrisonburg. It's sort of like tenting at a shelter for highway travelers. It has a privy (okay, a restroom), a water source, and other people. But, unlike a shelter, I don't feel particularly safe, and nobody wants to make eye contact let alone chat over a campfire.
It's still 250 miles home. But minutes after I pull out on I-81 the driver-side front tire blows out. ""Noooooo!"", I silently scream. But it's entirely predictable and entirely my fault. The tire pressure alert went off yesterday, but I ignored it because I was in a hurry trying to intercept my friends to do trail magic. I assumed it wasn't as critical as it was. Fortunately the highway shoulder is wide enough for me to change in the spare, and even more fortunately the spare has enough air to get me to the next gas station a few miles away where I check all the tires. Last August I was a passenger when Mongo had a blowout near Pearisburg, and his spare was flat. So fortune has smiled on me, or at least not kicked me when I am down.
I want to drive straight home because I've committed to driving my son to a scouting weekend tonight, but I know that's not wise. The spare is not meant for highway driving or 250 miles. The next Audi dealer is eighty miles away in Frederick and doesn't even open for more than an hour. I drive slowly up the interstate, aggravating morning commuters. When the dealer opens I call and find out they can't get the right size tire until this afternoon. So today's plan is blown up. Sara thankfully is able to cover things at home. I exit I-81 at Charles Town to head for the dealer in Frederick, but decide to try a local tire place along the way. Same story. But Mike the service guy is able to arrange a special late day tire delivery from Manassas to exactly match my tread. Until then, I have an afternoon to kill.
Everything happens for a reason, I suppose, even if we can't see it at first. In this case, I have wound up a few miles away from Harper's Ferry, the place I started the Appalachian Trail almost two years ago. I've come full circle.
I decide to do some trail magic. The cooler still has a couple dozen sodas, though all the beer went yesterday. I grab some fruit, donuts, and beer at the market and drive over to the parking lot by the bridge over the Shenandoah River where the trail crosses. No hikers are in sight, and there's no good visible spot to park, so I drive a few miles south to Keys Gap. There's a great spot, but after chatting with a couple dayhikers and looking at how close the shelters are I realize the thruhikers have already come through. So back to the bridge, where I glimpse several hikers disappearing into the woods as I pull up. I set up and hang out for over an hour but no others show up. By this point any who come through would be coming from shelters twenty or more miles away and won't be here for hours. 
So I pack up and head over to the ATC headquarters hoping to catch the hikers there. The volunteers tell me it's been nothing but dayhikers today. The Flip-Flop festival was last week so it's been slow recently. The older couple volunteering thrued in 2010, and just got back from hiking the Arizona Trail. A couple of sweaty hikers come in. From Milwaukee and Cleveland, they thrued in 2011 and are in the middle of a 117 mile southbound section. Having miserably failed at trail magicking today, I recover enough to ferry them to the post office down the street.
After lunch in the historic downtown I walk across the Potomac into Maryland and along the C&O Canal, remembering my first day on trail when I attempted to walk 45 miles to Pennsylvania. Dummy!  And a couple months earlier, when I hiked into Harpers Ferry with my then 12 year old daughter, trail name Snickers, on my first multinight AT trip. 
It's like walking through the past, a little surreal. I return to Harpers and wander up the hill, following the AT, to Jefferson Rock. A view worth crossing the Atlantic, according to Thomas. That leads me through the town's historic cemetery, holding the founding family and generations since. Maple trees release their seeds at the wind picks up. The helicopters twirl overhead and land silently in the grass. Each seed holds the potential for new life, even among the memorials to the dead.
I head over to get my tire. Turns out they sent the wrong model - right size but different tread. But at least they sent two, so we can keep it balanced. A minor setback, all things considered. I pawn some donuts off on the mechanics. Don't want to take all these sweets home. 
It starts to drizzle as I leave for home. Soon it's rain and then a downpour. The rain comes so thickly at times the wipers can't keep up. The storm surrounds me for hours, along the local highways through Gettysburg, York, and Lancaster. Finally I get ahead of it and arrive at my house to a dry, quiet night. Everyone is asleep. 
An eventful day, but now I'm safe, warm, and dry...at home.",,View Entry,"May 03, Fri",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614286,"I'm back on the trail for a week to hike with my old tramily (or at least what's left of it!) By coincidence they are leaving Waynesboro, Virginia this morning to enter Shenandoah, making an easy entry point for me.
I'm out the door in Chester County, Pennsylvania, a little after 5am and get to Waynesboro, 300 miles away, around 9:30. Clammy sent a text about going to the post office at 9 before hitting the trail, so I grab breakfast before heading to Rockfish Gap.
Five thruhikers are getting dropped off. A guy named Sweatsicles, a thin British guy from Devon, an Aussie, another guy and a girl. All are just back from Trail Days and loving life. Two have identical loud Hawaiian shirts they just got from Walmart. None have seen Clammy, UNICEF, Fast Lane, or Food Truck. So I hike north into Shenandoah National Park. 
The forest has exploded in green since I left the trail in Damascus on May 1. The understory is a sea of ferns, shrubs, flowers, grass, and young trees. The trail is well-graded and groomed, a dirt path through the woods. The classic image of the AT.
I fill out a backcountry permit at the self-registration station a mile in and hang it on my pack. So much simpler than the Smokies system, and free. A  guy named PonyKeg is there with a girl, both just back from Trail Days. He's hiking in a new Toy Story onesie from Target. Why they make them in his size I can't say. Ironically Damascus, location of Trail Days, has neither a Walmart nor Target.
An hour in, at 11:30, I get another text from Clammy that they just hit the trail at Rockfish Gap. Oh, man, they're behind me! I was hurrying to catch up. So I slow down. I meander around the radio towers on Bears Den Mountain. The fire circle with tractor seats embedded in the ground is in rough shape - overgrown and falling apart. Down in Beagle Gap I hang out and get some sun for a couple hours. The hikers from earlier wander in, but none of my tramily. 
So I hike a couple more miles up to Calf Mountain shelter. Along the way I see a bird on the trail with an injured wing. I try to examine him, as if I could just pop it back into place, but the little thing squawks and resists so I back off fearing I'll worsen the injury. It's tough leaving it, knowing the bird is easy pickings for a predator.  
It's well after 3 when I reach the shelter so I figure it's likely my friends will stop here tonight, even though it's only seven miles out of town. Sweatsicles and the Brit start gathering wood for a fire despite today's high in the 80s. They arrange the tinder and kindling into neat little piles while I absent-mindedly eat dinner. I left my new stove at home to save a little weight. In warm weather hot meals are not as attractive so it's tuna, cheese, and summer sausage on tortillas.
By quarter of five I realize I've made a huge mistake. My tramily isn't behind me - they're ahead of me! The text I received at 11:30 was probably sent two hours earlier. I've wasted the whole afternoon waiting while they've been hiking. This isn't the first time texts have been delayed while hiking, but it's usually because one or the other party doesn't have service. In this case we both had service because an interstate highway runs through Rockfish Gap. I'm confused as to why texts don't say when they were sent rather than received. Seems much more pertinent. Texts, in fact, have no delivery guarantee at all, making it a lousy method of communication.
Anyways, off I go, stopping at a spring for water along the long side trail from the shelter to the trail. To confirm my suspicion I just then get a new text from Clammy that they passed this shelter long ago and are nearing the next one, 13 miles away. So I head north, figuring I can cover the distance in four hours given the nice trail, which puts my arrival around 9, in the fading twilight. I hate night hiking, and my Petzl eLite headlamp has very low wattage, but 9 is manageable. 
I follow a detour around some power line construction. After twenty minutes I realize my hands are unnaturally free. I've forgotten my trekking poles. Nuts! Back I go. I remember I put them down to get water and forgot them as I hurried off while juggling the bottles into my pack pockets. Twenty minutes later they're not at the spring. Some well-intentioned hiker must have taken them to the shelter. Sure enough, there they are. I head off after taking some ribbing from the shelter-dwellers. I've left my poles before, but always remembered them within a minute or so. I was just too focused on catching my friends. 
That mistake cost me 50 minutes, and now I have to hike four miles an hour to make it by dark! Off I go, determined to set a personal best. Along the way I encounter two deer that are overly accustomed to humans. They travel on the trail as they browse, and seem in no hurry to get off despite my approach. At the last moment they sulkily walk off trail to let me by, giving me resentful looks as I pass.
Seven miles in I realize I can go even faster if I walk on Skyline Drive for awhile. The trail crosses it several times between here and the shelter. Five miles of road walking gets me six miles of trail. Plus I can sustain a faster pace on asphalt. I speed walk the road, swinging by several scenic overlooks. The trail misses most of these. I see the sun dipping over the Shenandoah Valley. Very few cars are out. While the road is open 24/7, it's mostly a weekend pursuit at this time of year.
The sun sets at 8:23 but I still have two and a half miles to go. I'm doing thirteen to fourteen minute miles by this point, more of a jogging pace than a hike. As the twilight dims I swing back on the trail for the final half mile up a hill to Black Rock shelter. In the woods it's even darker. When I reach the side trail to the shelter it gets darker yet. I don't bother to fetch my headlamp out of the pack. It's so dim it would hardly help, and I'd rather use the fading light to walk than search my pack. 
Finally I stumble over the last rocks into the shelter area. Clammy's voice rings out from the dark shelter, ""Valley!"" He knew I would make it tonight. That's what I do.
Food Truck is with him, but Fast Lane is back in Waynesboro, delayed by running into some old friends a couple days ago at Devil's Backbone. He'll catch up in a few days. UNICEF is not here - he decided to start hiking his own hike back in Buena Vista, and went to Trail Days this past weekend. It's sad to see the tramily broken up, but good to know they are enjoying the trail the way they want to.
After catching up I try to sleep off the long day. But my seasonal allergies are acting up and it's a tough night trying to keep my air passages open. Gotta take my pill later in the day.",,View Entry,"May 20, Mon",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614308,"Two of our sheltermates are up at 4:30, but all their racket barely disturbs me, exhausted as I am by the long miles of late yesterday. 
I have breakfast with Up and Over (he puts on his pack by swinging it over his head). He's a retiree from Connecticut with a decades-long dream to hike the AT. He planned to do the Long Trail first to test out his mettle in backpacking, but with the support of his wife went whole hog instead. I hike with him to nearby Blackrock summit and scramble up the boulder pile to take in the 360 degree view at the top.
Shenandoah is home to three ""waysides"" - short-order grills - as well as two lodges with restaurants and two campground stores with food, all spaced out over 100 miles. Most days a hiker can have a restaurant meal once or even twice. It's Virginia's answer to the ""deli run"" in the mid-Atlantic states.We're headed seven miles to first of these food stops, Loft Mountain campstore.  Here I run into Zig again. I last saw him at the trail magic I gave near Bland. There's also a guy from Devon, PA who recognizes the Valley Forge name. In the store I load up on cheese sticks. They are becoming my favorite trail snack. A couple miles later I get to the Loft Mountain Wayside. It's three minutes to eleven, so I order breakfast and then ten minutes later lunch. And blackberry ice cream of course. Yum! The milkshake machine is on the fritz but it doesn't matter because the ice cream is almost better by itself.
The afternoon drags for awhile. I soak my head in Ivy Creek's falls, but it's not very hot today. I take my time and sit at all the overlooks. It ends up being a 21 mile day, same as yesterday. It's perfect hiking weather with clear skies, low humidity and temps in the seventies, cooler in the shade, and a cool breeze.
On the last couple miles to the shelter I meet a section hiker named Shaina struggling with some blisters caused by her new boots. She's a traveling nurse trying to finish hiking Shenandoah. I have plenty of gauze and KT tape so I show her how I used to care for my own heel blisters and leave her enough to finish the park.
A wonderful surprise greets me just before climbing up to Hightop Hut for the night. Bluegrass and Sunshine are offering trail magic. I down the coldest most refreshing Coke I've ever had. They are both thruhiking but Sunshine has developed plantar fasciitis and is slackpacking her boyfriend Bluegrass through the park while she recovers. She sees him many times a day thanks to the frequent road crossings. They remember seeing me last evening hiking down the road. I walked right past their van at an overlook.
I'm in the shelter again tonight with Food Truck, Clammy, a tall red-haired kid named Tortuga and his friend Andy who's joining him for a few days. Andy's a distance runner and has been gamely keeping up with Tortuga's (and our) long days but he's obviously feeling it. It's hard dropping into the middle of a thruhike! I remember starting in Harpers Ferry and marveling at the pace many hikers from Georgia could sustain over any terrain. I felt like a snail for a long time.",,View Entry,"May 21, Tue",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614311,"More gorgeous weather today. It's almost too cool, but I'm not complaining. I slept better than the first night, except for Clammy's 3am wake-up call in the form of tremendously loud gas that had Tortuga out of bed thinking there was a bear in camp. Good times!
Again we're heading to a campstore, this time at Lewis Mountain. The descent into and out of Swift Run Gap is relatively steep but easy going. The trail is ridiculously well-groomed here with few rocks, roots or deadfall and no washed out areas.
A Quebecois girl named Rose (or Mervel) joins us at the store. We met in Fontana and again in Hot Springs. I get a couple sandwiches and drinks and feel quite full. You can get a shower here for a dollar so we all take advantage. No towel of course, but a few paper towels from the bathroom dispenser get the job done.
Afterwards I hike a bit with Food Truck. He's turning 21 next month and, like Clammy, celebrated two months on the trail yesterday. He grew up in State College, Pennsylvania, home of my alma mater Penn State, and worked on a horse farm in Erie for three years after high school. He doesn't see any more thruhikes in his near future but he's enjoying this experience immensely. 
We take a side trail down to Lewis Falls, leaving our packs behind. It's a rocky steep 3/4 mile descent but I'm bounding over it without a pack. It deposits us at the top of an eighty-foot falls. We are literally on the edge of a sheer cliff and it's awesome. Like something out of a tropical jungle. I step away to soak my head in the upper cascades and can't find Food Truck when I return. I call around then run up the trail. A dayhiker coming down hasn't seen him. God, did he fall? Where could he have gone? I'm searching for his phone number as I descend back when I see him coming up. He had gone further down to get a side view. Whew! Gave me a scare.
We have dinner at Big Meadows Lodge in the pub to celebrate his trailaversary (and because we love to eat), then we search for the trail. The staff says it's just downhill, so we bushwhack through the ferns, ""greenblazing"" until we hit it. 
Just a few hundred yards further as we skirt the campground we encounter trail magic in the form of what looks like a giant family cookout. It's a group of retired teachers from Maryland who camp here for a week every year and feed hikers. They've been doing this seven years. I'm too stuffed to eat anything but I take a beer. Food Truck downs four hot dogs and bags of chips. To be fair, his pizza dinner was kind of small.
It's only four miles to the shelter, which is tucked down on the western hillside. There's a cabin for rent nearby with a beautiful view of the Shenandoah Valley and Elkton. At the shelter is the same gang as last night plus a Dane named Viking working on his third thruhike attempt in as many years and a guy turning sixty next month named Pirate.",,View Entry,"May 22, Wed",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614401,"Fourth day in Shenandoah. I'm up at 5:40 despite the shelter facing west. Skyland's buffet breakfast is calling! It takes little time to pack up when you sleep in the shelter and aren't cooking for breakfast. Yet most hikers prefer tenting and cooking. Maybe it feels a little more domestic and a little less like vagrancy.
The trail is stonier and rockier in the northern half of the park. I pass up the side trail to Hawksbill summit, the highest point in Shenandoah, for the second time. Last year I hiked this section with my daughter Snickers. I had the idea to climb it last evening after dropping my pack at the shelter to see the sun set. But once I reached the shelter inertia set in.
I thought I couldn't eat again after yesterday, but I'm all over the buffet. Pancakes, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, spinach quiche, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and of course an omelet station! Thirty minutes later I can't move. I don't return to the trail for two and a half hours, and even then I'm moving very slowly.
Coming down from the Stony Man summit side trail a group of dayhikers passes and chatters about a bear they just saw. I ask about it and one little boy is very excited. He asks my trail name and I tell him Valley Forge, after my hometown. Then I ask him his. It's Three Ties, after the clip-on ties he got for special occasions. We bump fists and he beams.
A few miles later approaching Pinnacles picnic area I see my first bear of this trip. He's an adult and only thirty or forty feet away, browsing in the bushes. He looks at me, ambles a few steps away and stares into space, waiting for me to leave. I walk up to Rose and Clammy at a picnic table and point to the bear. He has come up closer to the trail. Clammy goes over to take a picture, against our better judgment, but the bear ignores him. 
On the other side of Pinnacle mountain we collapse in Byrd's Nest #3 Hut. It has a fireplace and open sleeping platform. We chat with a dayhiker named Ubi training for a southbound thruhike starting in a few weeks. He wants to know about how to find water, what guide to use, and more last minute tips. 
There's a front of thunderstorms headed our way. It's been warm today, though cooler than expected. Afternoon thunderstorms aren't a surprise. Clammy waits to ride it out in the shelter. I sit for a few minutes and get antsy. I've walked through rain many times. It will probably be refreshing. So I hike on. 
On Mary's Rock I scramble up the ledges and watch the curtain of rain cross the valley. The wind is already whipping up. It'll be here in a few minutes. Throwing on my poncho, I head down towards Thornton Gap with the first raindrops hitting my face. Within minutes it's a downpour. I hike quickly over the wet rocks and puddles. My Lone Peak shoes blew out on the sides at some point in the last few days. The puddles seep in quickly now. I pass a dayhiker couple unprepared for the weather, huddled next to a large tree on the narrow ledge of the trail. But the rain tapers off within twenty minutes. Other than my shoes and socks (and poncho), everything is dry.
Mystic is at the bottom, looking for Sunshine and Bluegrass' minivan. They've offered her a lift into Luray.  She heads up route 211 while I continue hiking north. I spy the van in Skyline Drive and go over to alert them where she went, then head to the crossing over 211 to find her. But she's found her way up and they're soon on their way. 
At Thornton Gap I'm leaving the section I hiked with my daughter, Snickers, and entering the section I hiked with my then nine-year-old son last spring. It's a good climb up Pass Mountain, where I find Food Truck drying out at the shelter with a pair of section hikers - mom and grown daughter. Soon fifteen other thru- and section hikers stream in, most of them tenting. I've seen all of them over the last several days. Outside of this group I've seen only the occasional dayhikers. But Memorial Day weekend is coming so that will change. I build a fire out of somewhat damp wood. It takes forever, even with Zig fanning it with his sitpad. A wax-covered cotton pad from the younger section hiker at least gets it started. There's a lively conversation, but I'm pretty beat and retire to the shelter loft to rest.",,View Entry,"May 23, Thu",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614658,"Viking and Pirate hike past the shelter before 6, as we're still rubbing our eyes and packing up. Our plan is the same as the last couple days: hike quickly to food, stop, eat said food, hike slowly to a shelter. This morning's stop is the Elkwallow Wayside seven miles away.
I'm out in front for the morning hike, looking for bears. No luck! The miles go quickly chatting with Clammy as we head over Pass Mountain, through Beames Gap, and over unnamed ridges. I pass the site where my son and I stealth camped last year. Having just seen most of the park it's a surprisingly good spot. Other than a few summits there are almost no decent tenting spots thanks to the narrow ridgeline and Skyline Drive. We got lucky finding this one.
Bluegrass, the slackpacker, is hiking ahead of us and stops to pass on a warning about an aggressive bear at Rattlesnake Point a few miles ahead. Clammy and I breathe a sigh of relief - we thought he was going to report the Wayside was out of order! Priorities...
I'm customer number one at the counter for breakfast. An hour later we get milkshakes and an hour after that, at 11, I order lunch. Meanwhile most of the other thruhikers from the shelter stream in like Zig, Bedpan (the guy from my neck of Pennsylvania), Smash, Nibbles, Radar, and Rose. The wayside only have supplies for 6 milkshakes and they go quickly. The milkshake machine was busted at Loft Mountain Wayside, and Big Meadows Wayside was closed entirely, so this is our last chance. You'd think the concessions in such a popular park would be better managed, but nope. Still, somehow I've managed to survive!
I hike alone all afternoon, covering almost seventeen miles to the northern park boundary and slightly beyond to Tom Floyd shelter. Along the way are Hogback Mountain, Little Hogback, Hogwallow Flats, and Hogwallow Gap and I remember my son's delight at all the pig references (there's also Pignut Mountain off the AT). There are several gorgeous views over the Shenandoah Valley from rocky outcroppings on these hills as well as North and South Marshall Mountains. It continues to be rockier in this area than in the southern section of the park.
I see a deer or two and hear some unidentified crashes in the woods but no confirmed bear sightings today. There are only a handful of dayhikers out and none of the other thruhikers appear to be going this far. 
Finally I cross Skyline Drive for the last time and walk a level dirt path to the edge of the park where my son and I ended our hike last year. We had walked out with three ladies finishing the entire park as a series of dayhikes and driven them back to their car. But now I turn to follow the AT down a craggy cliff and to the shelter. Here Clammy, Food Truck, Rose and three southbound section hikers await. The sectioners are a father with his early-twenties son and daughter. The shelter is full and Rose has the only tent site that isn't a five minute hike down the hill, so I elect to cowboy camp on the deck attached to the shelter.  There may be a view of the stars later, but for now I'm fending off a horde of gnats. The joys of nature!",,View Entry,"May 24, Fri",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621340,"I'm up with the birds at Tom Floyd shelter just north of Shenandoah. Thankfully there was no rain last night on my open deck cowboy camping perch. Clammy and Food Truck intend to drop into Front Royal for most of the day to resupply and clean up before hiking on. They're going about 10 days between motel stays (neither is keen on hostels) and won't be overnighting again until Pennsylvania. I'm headed to town with them, but then I have to part ways and get back to my car at the far end of Shenandoah. Not sure how yet. I'll figure that out later.
The four miles to the road are mostly downhill and pass quickly. The trail crosses a meadow with western views over the Smithsonian Biological Preserve in the last mile. Flip the Trailman, a local shuttler, has left a trail magic cooler a half mile from the road with knockoff Mountain Dews. I down the first half eagerly, but it's not really my cup of tea. Food Truck helps polish it off. 
At the road Clammy tries hitching even before we cross to the west bound side, but as soon as we are on the proper side, with room to turn off, I stick out my thumb and the first vehicle pulls over. First time that's ever happened! It's a local guy in his work truck. He's prepping for his contracting licensing exam. He drops us off at the Front Royal diner, where we demolish a large breakfast. Rose shows up halfway through and joins in. 
The four of us walk over to Martin's supermarket. I know we're in the north now because it's part of my home supermarket chain - Giant - and accepts my discount card. While they resupply I sip cold tea outside and chat with a father of four very young kids who was an avid hiker pre-fatherhood and is looking forward to a time when the kids are old enough to join him. Meanwhile he picks my brain about good section hikes as the kids tug on his hands and run around the propane filling center. 
Rose says goodbye to head back to the trail. She always has a smile, though she must have tough days like we all do. She's already hiked the El Camino and parts of New Zealand and seems likely to hike more after the AT. In fact she plans to hike home to Quebec once she reaches Katahdin. I wish her well. Meanwhile the rest of us walk a mile to an outfitter on Main Street in Front Royal's historic and quaint downtown. The combination outfitter, bakery, and brewpub offers free showers and laundry to hikers, and we take full advantage. I don't feel anywhere near as filthy as I did hiking last summer. The weather has been very pleasant with low humidity and little rain. But I know I still stink and the shower feels amazing.
The chalkboard wall in the hiker room is signed by scores of hikers with their name and hometown, many with creative sketches. I recognize a few names. My entry is easy since it covers both! Bluegrass and Sunshine appear as we're finishing up and she adds a colorful entry of their own. On the way out the bakery hands me a slice of cake - it's customer appreciation day. For me, it's Front Royal appreciation day! The guy at the outfitter snaps my picture with a large carved wooden bear stationed outside before sending me on my way.
One reason for lounging here all morning was to give Fast Lane a chance to catch up. We know he pulled a long day yesterday and started only 11 miles behind us. But after several hours I need to start my journey to my car, so I say goodbye to Clammy and Food Truck as they eat their cake. I hope to see them again when they pass through Pennsylvania.
I walk back towards the supermarket where route 340 heads south out of town. I manage to reach Fast Lane on the phone only to find out he just got into town but went directly to the outfitter rather than the market. So I missed him by only twenty minutes, after five days of being a day ahead of him.
My car is not exactly nearby. In fact it's way down at Rockfish Gap - over 100 miles by the AT and over 80 miles by local roads through Shenandoah Valley. I've called several local shuttlers already this morning. Only one was available and wanted $160. It's Memorial Day weekend so my choices are limited. I opt to hitch. I think secretly I wanted the challenge, and a little unplanned adventure.
I've never hitched more than a few miles, and always into town or back to the trail. The longest I think was ten miles to Gorham from Pinkham Notch in the Whites. It's straightforward getting picked up near a trailhead. Everyone knows where you want to go and nearly everyone is headed there anyway. But hitching eighty miles through four or five towns on a route not usually used by hikers requires a lot more patience. I've never hitched two or more rides in sequence, but I figure I'll need at least four rides and probably more like eight to ten. One to get out of town, another to get from wherever they turn off the main road down to the next town. Times four or five towns.
Front Royal is a lousy place to hitch from. Route 340 is clogged with tourists headed into the national park, not where I want to go (it takes three hours just to drive Skyline without stopping). There's no shoulder to turn off. On a whim I stop at another outfitter at the edge of town to ask for directions, in the hope some trail angel or kind customer will give me a lift. No luck. I'm given the card of another shuttler, but when I call he's working at an outfitter in Luray and not available for five hours.
So I walk a mile out of town, past the turnoff for the park, and stick out my thumb. I walk backward while hitching, thinking I might as well cover distance as I wait, but I know this is dumb. Better to find a good spot, be patient, and get a ride then to walk into a narrow or dangerous stretch just to cover a little distance. No way I can walk any meaningful portion of that eighty miles today.
Sure enough, patience pays off and a truck pulls over after a few minutes. It's another local contractor. Good guy, but he's turning off in just a mile so he can't take me very far. Still, he goes a little out of his way to drop me at Shenandoah Caverns, saying it's a hot day and I can get a drink there.
Unfortunately it's also a horrible stretch of road for hitching - narrow and winding with embankments on both sides causing poor visibility. I'm starting to regret my plan. None of the cavern-goers are getting ready to leave, so I start walking down the road. Since there's no shoulder I walk on the debris-strewn ribbon of dirt and gravel alongside. Traffic is lighter - bad for hitching but good for walking. No one could stop safely even if they wanted to. After a while the road widens a bit up ahead, so I stick out the thumb. Visibility is still a problem - drivers going in my direction have little time to see and decide whether to pick up this grizzled backpacker. Then, during a lull, out of the blue a van going the opposite direction slows and the driver asks if I want a ride. Well, yeah! Dre, the driver, makes a U-turn and takes me 15 miles. He's using me as an excuse to visit his in-laws in a rural hamlet near the highway and see their new puppies. He's not familiar with hikers or the AT, just didn't want to go home yet. Having reached the turn off to his in-laws, Dre drops me in the middle of nowhere, nine miles north of Luray. But at least it's a highway with wide shoulders and visibility for half a mile - ideal for hitching. 
Still, this third hitch takes awhile. Uncounted cars pass with nary a glance. Patience, Valley. No one knows you've been standing here for five, ten, fifteen minutes, rejected over and over again! Not sure I have the mental fortitude for bumming rides. I feel like I'm doing it wrong. Should I smile more? Are my poles threatening? Do I look too desperate? I want to walk while I wait, but again, that's just dumb. I'll be walking into another unhitchable cattle chute. Finally, after God knows how long, a guy from Winchester, Virginia stops. He's visiting his daughter in Luray and takes me the next nine miles into the center of town, dropping me near Uncle Buck's diner where I breakfasted with my son last year. Of course the middle of a town is a tough place to hitch for various reasons, not least of which the adage that hikers at the trailhead look like hobos in town. After three rides I've only come a quarter of the way. This may take all day at this rate ... and then some. And it's really hot now. So I grab a milkshake before walking out to the bypass. Lots of tourist traffic - and two state police cars (hitchhiking is legal here, right? Let's not find out) - but no one stops. Tough place to pull over, and the 211 and 340 traffic is merging. 
I walk a mile up the road along a grassy shoulder, not even thumbing since no one's going to pull over here. A black pickup pulls off a few hundred yards ahead near a chain link gate. Taking a call? Going to open the gate? I maintain my pace, unsure if he is there for me. Or am I keeping him waiting? Should I be hurrying? No, that's presumptuous. Then I see him in the mirror, watching me. Yep, he is waiting on me. ""You want a ride or what?"" comes the gruff voice as I approach cautiously. ""Well, throw it in the back"". Not sure whether I should hop in back along with my pack until he invites me upfront. The driver is Trevor, 52-year-old Luray native and proud union carpenter. He agrees to take me the sixteen miles to Elkton, as far as I dare hope from one ride. Trevor wants to talk. Literally. He's not the listening type. People who listen to him make the best conversationalists. But I know which side my bread is buttered on. I soak it all in. His job history, his family, his likes and dislikes, his regular demonstrations of why he'll never be married and why he likes it that way.
Eleven miles in, at the town of Shenandoah, a car show is diverting traffic on to back roads. I expect his patience is wearing thin and I am not interesting enough to bother with much longer. Another six miles to Elkton. More talk. Originally this was as far as I asked, figuring no one would be going all the way to Waynesboro. But he's clearly not busy and is using me as an excuse to take a road trip.  He's just finished a story about donating a kidney to his teenage nephew. He was the only match but he didn't just volunteer it. He waited for his nephew to ask him for it, to teach him a lesson to be direct and ask for what you want in life. Of course he said yes. So, where I would normally not want to impose further, I ask (directly) if he'll take me to Waynesboro. He agrees, like he's been waiting for me to ask. And no doubt he has more stories to tell and more hard-earned advice. Another thirty-plus miles through Grottoes and Waynesboro. Soon he's dropping me off in Rockfish Gap. And just like that, what was turning into an all day (or night) adventure is over in about three hours thanks to Travis.
Once more behind my own wheel and in control of my own destiny, I grab dinner at Chick-fil-A as I plot a way to find UNICEF, the last of our merry band. I have a text with the shelter he's headed for, but that's over a hundred road miles and four hiking miles away and it's nearly six o'clock. No problem! Catching up is my specialty. I order a large number of nuggets to go to surprise some hungry hikers.
It's seven-thirty in the evening as I hike out from a secluded dirt parking lot near Paris, Virginia. I've missed the thunderstorm that's soaked all the undergrowth, though I drove through it, as well as through a tornado warning. The storm was powerful enough to knock out electricity to all the gas stations at one exit I happened to need them. Now the shrubs soak me as I speed through the rolling, rocky, and dense trail. Around 8:30 I reach Rod Hollow shelter. Two boy scout troops are bustling around the tentsites. The shelter-dwellers point me toward UNICEF'S site. ""Anyone seen a guy named Space Heater?"" I call out as I approach. ""Saw him last at Neel Gap. He was sitting next to a space heater so I figured that was his name..."" It's a story UNICEF loves to tell of a girl's comical attempt to name him before we met. He stumbles out of the tent, surprised but happy. ""When you texted you had to get your car, I didn't think you meant in another state!"" When I pull out the nuggets his eyes light up. I offer them to the rest of the shelter, but only a guy named General Lee who looks like a college quarterback takes me up on it. His enthusiasm more than makes up for the others' disinterest. The two of them down almost sixty nuggets while UNICEF and I catch up on the last few weeks. He struck out on his own after McAfee Knob. Suffice to say it was time to start hiking his own hike. Our tramily was great while it lasted, but even at the time it seemed like an anomaly to be together every day.
Driving up this evening I had hatched a plan for a road trip tomorrow for a special reunion. UNICEF is all in. He's meeting a friend in Harper's Ferry, just thirty miles away, in four days so he's got time to kill. We head off to bed. I coax a spot in the shelter from several section hikers who've taken it over, and reflect on the crazy turns this day has taken. Unlike almost every other day on the AT, I had no idea where I'd end up when I woke up this morning.",,View Entry,"May 25, Sat",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621341,"Eight hundred miles ago, back in the Smokies, we met a gregarious young couple named Jacob and Liv, aka Scrub-a-Dub and Go-Gurt. It was just our tramily and them at Russell Field shelter the first night out of Fontana, the only ones willing to hike three extra miles past Mollie's Ridge where twenty-odd hikers had crowded in. We had a great evening around the fireplace and became fast friends. They moved a little slower than our group but we saw them several times up through Hot Springs. There they zeroed a couple days and we left them behind. I left town without even saying goodbye, thinking they were already ahead of me. When I later tried to catch them by car in the Grayson Highlands I found the road was impassable. This trip I was determined to find them. When Scrub-a-Dub texted they were headed for Devil's Backbone Brewery today it was too good an opportunity. I would not only catch them myself, but I would surprise them by bringing UNICEF. He in particular had clicked with the two of them, and I sensed he wished he had slowed down to stay in their orbit. I was pretty confident UNICEF would grab a chance to see them no matter what, and fortunately the timing was perfect.
Since they didn't expect to get to Devil's Backbone until late afternoon I also planned to find Belch and Gina, the couple I hiked with into Damascus. They'd been off trail awhile and were just now leaving Pearisburg. UNICEF was game for the three hour road trip, but unfortunately that stretch of trail north of Pearisburg has no road crossings. Mission aborted! I will have to catch them up in Pennsylvania. They are another couple I am very fond of and wish nothing but the best. It's been a tough hike for them, for reasons I may eventually be able to relate, and I wanted to give them a morale boost. A phone call had to suffice.
What to do with our time then? Well, breakfast obviously! Waffle House is UNICEF's choice. We leave satisfied. Our plan is to intercept Clammy, Food Truck, and Fast Lane with a little trail magic. So we hit the supermarket for beer, soda, oranges, and a styrofoam cooler. We'll spend much of the day babysitting this cooler in the car as it bounces around.
Our targets rise early and hike fast, so our only hope of intercepting them is at Sky Meadows State Park. The official entrance is almost two miles from the AT by a side trail, so we aim for a backroad that provides quick access to the AT. It's very close to where I parked last night. But unfortunately it's an intimidating dirt track meant for 4x4's, not low-riding Audi sedans. 
Back to the drawing board. Clammy texted this morning that Fast Lane had actually stayed in Front Royal last night. So we might at least catch him farther south. We do some figuring. If I were Fast Lane, what would I do? Wait to take the trolley out of town, probably. Our conclusion is we can comfortably catch him at route 55 by the I-66 underpass, about eight miles from his starting point. So we meander over there by a scenic backroad, imagining we will be doling out trail magic for awhile before he arrives.
About thirty seconds after we park, as I am manhandling the cooler from the car, UNICEF calls out ""There he is!"" Holy crikey! Another minute and we would have missed him and been none the wiser. We could have sat here for hours before figuring it out. What a serendipity! In fact Fast Lane hitched out of town early. He's not moving too quickly though. It's doubtful he'll catch Food Truck and Clammy. In fact he's meeting a friend in Maryland later this week so he too will fall behind the tramily, perhaps for good. Meanwhile he has time to kill. We offer to take him with us to Devil's Backbone. He's thinks it over for a few seconds, possibly for dramatic effect, before giving the only logical response. Now we are three! This is gonna be a big surprise for Scrub-a-Dub and Go-Gurt, and it just came together by pure luck.
Meanwhile other thruhikers are coming through. Mooney, the girl I met with PonyKeg back near Rockfish Gap. An older couple Eagle Eye and Milky Way (she hates Snickers) with their dog Baxter. And new faces Pomme, Bolt, Brooklyn, and Siesta. The latter group Fast Lane has been hiking with through Shenandoah. The oranges go, along with half the drinks. Some of them refuse to take a drink for the road. Fair, I guess. It's not hot or humid enough yet. They'll change their tune in a few weeks! I remember days I would have given my left arm for a cold drink. 
Anyway, off we go on our road trip. We spend a couple hours driving down I-81 through Shenandoah Valley (my fifth time this week covering this stretch) catching up and reliving good times. Fast Lane also seems to be enjoying hiking his own hike, though he remains a man of few words. 
At Devil's Backbone we unload everything so I can drive up to Reeds Gap to pick up Scrub-a-Dub, Go-Gurt and their friends. I find them hanging out near the parking area with two friends from Penn State who joined them for a dayhike - trail names PSU (also his real initials) and GoPro. They've just hiked ten miles out of the Tye River valley over Three Ridges, one of the biggest climbs on the AT south of New Hampshire. And they are ready for some food and drinks. We manage to squeeze in everyone, their packs, and their dog  for the ten minute ride back to Devil's Backbone. Scrub-a-Dub asks who I brought along. Oh, just a couple guys I met down in Georgia. We park, and as we walk towards a tree where UNICEF and Fast Lane are enjoying a pre-game beer in the shade I see recognition hit Scrub-a-Dub. He bounds the last seventy yards over to them with a happy holler as Go-Gurt gives me a mischevious look and ribs me over my ""sly"" scheming. It was all worth it for this moment. It's a reunion that needed to happen. 
The afternoon and evening fly by thanks to good company and ample refreshments. PSU and GoPro are fun guys, and soon we're joined by other thruhikers. Space Jam, Orange, Honeybee, Lazarus, Not Dead Yet, LASH, and Captain S'mores. Honeybee looks familiar but I don't know why. Lazarus got his name from surviving a (non-life-threatening) trail illness. LASH and Not Dead Yet are section hiking. S'mores thrued last year and is planning for the PCT next year. He just came out to dayhike Three Ridges to ""feel the burn"".
A bachelorette party sets up at the next table. Relatively tame, but the women are from all over the northeast. The bride wears a sash spelling ""Bride"" but missing the ""D"" due to some inside joke. Scrub-a-Dub, several beers in, chats them up while Go-Gurt leans over to me and confesses her amusement at his drunken flirting. She too is a few beers in, and half his weight. 
Eventually PSU and GoPro have to head back to life in the big city, the bachelorettes decamp, and all of us hiker trash walk (in some cases stumble) through the brewery's brand new campground to the open field where they let hikers tent for free. I carry the cooler over, someone builds a campfire, and more tales are unwound around it as darkness falls. 
Just as I am about to head off to bed I hear through the darkness a conversation from nearby tents. One of the voices calls over to ""Tribute"". Tribute! The guy I celebrated my completion of the trail with at a hostel in Damascus weeks ago. I call him and he comes out with a surprised grin. He's here with his tramily - that's why Honeybee sounded familiar! I have to tell him how I bumped into his old tramily member Snowbird just hours (and 130 trail miles) after leaving him in Damascus. He's quite amused. Once again the coincidences of the trail astound me. 
I have one of my most comfortable nights on trail tenting under the pines behind the brewery that night. Tomorrow I'll ferry them all back to the points I took them off trail and they will continue making their way north. They've all proven by now that they have the will and the resourcefulness to reach Maine. I hope luck and good health stay on their side, and perhaps I'll see them again before they finish.",,View Entry,"May 26, Sun",0
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622824,"At sunset UNICEF and I reached a stealth site by North Pond four miles into Maine's 100 Mile Wilderness, headed for Katahdin. It was the end of a very long day. I had started before 3am at home near Philadelphia. 
For the last two months, since returning UNICEF and Fast Lane to their northern Virginia trailheads following our reunion at Devil's Backbone Brewery with Go-Gurt and Scrub-a-Dub, I've kept tabs on my old tramily through occasional texts. As they came through Pennsylvania I came out to meet them. First, Food Truck and Clammy at Port Clinton, where my young sons and I waited in the old railyard as they bounded down the steep trail. To everyone's surprise they were followed twenty minutes later by Fast Lane, who hadn't seen them since taking off a few days in Maryland. They had even tented at the same shelter the night before, unaware of the other. We grabbed breakfast, took them to Walmart to resupply, watched them explode their packs in the parking lot, and took them right back to the trail. Clammy was intent on hiking fast through the mid-Atlantic. Fast Lane was decidedly less hurried.
A few days later UNICEF came through. He had already resupplied when I found him at Cabela's south of Port Clinton. He had taken a week off to visit a friend in DC but had hiked big miles since. Although not fast, he'd gotten into the habit of hiking dawn to dusk, and never zeroed or even stayed in town, so the miles piled up. Still, he was in no rush, so after lunch we drove up to Pottsville to tour the Yuengling Brewery. Since I was driving he got most of our free samples and probably doesn't remember the few miles he later hiked to Windsor Furnace shelter! He had stories: the day before a hiker named Scout had stolen cash and credit cards from a woman's purse at the Port Clinton barbershop, a business that is very hiker-friendly. This same hiker also had a habit of stealing from other hikers; when UNICEF caught him going through his pack the guy claimed he thought it was a hiker box! That evening at the park pavilion in Port Clinton, which is open to hikers as a shelter, the woman's husband came around to confront Scout and retrieve the stolen cash. Threats were made, the police were called, and soon UNICEF and the other hikers were getting dragged into it. The guy even came back later that night. Needless to say UNICEF was happy to put that town behind him. As if that weren't enough, a creepy hiker who goes by Air Quotes, among other names, was hiking in his bubble and acting erratically. With the tragedy in Virginia still fresh, it was putting people on edge. I discovered he was the same guy I tented with my second night in Georgia. He called himself Frog at the time, was meditating when I met him, and quoted Wittgenstein over the campfire. His manner was disconcerting even then.
Finally in early July I drove to Boiling Springs to see Belch and Gina, who I last saw in Damascus. These two have been through a lot, before and during their hike, but were still plugging away. They were cautious about taking too much time off once they get to New Jersey, their home state, fearing they wouldn't get back on trail. Gina had less than two months before her leave ended from her teaching job and they were trying to pick up the pace. A month later I learned they did end up leaving the trail, having too little time left to reach Katahdin. 1300 miles is quite an accomplishment though. I hope that despite (or even because of) the obstacles, they got what they were looking for from the AT.
Which brings me to today. After leaving my house at 3 in the morning I drove ten hours to Monson in north central Maine. It turns out New York traffic is almost bearable at 5am. Not so much Boston traffic a few hours later. The last couple hours were spent on rural highways through small towns in Maine, passing logging trucks. Not until the last few miles did I start climbing above a few hundred feet elevation.
UNICEF spotted me as I pulled in to Shaw's hostel. He ambled over in his low-key manner like he couldn't believe I'd actually showed. He'd been relaxing since yesterday, enjoying his first hostel stay since Hot Springs, 1800 miles ago! A trail angel recently pushed him to accept $50 so he could stay in a hostel. If he'd experienced Shaw's early on instead of the hard floor at Laughing Heart, he might have tried a few other hostels along the way. He waxed on about Shaw's bottomless pancake and bacon breakfast for days after.
Hanging out in the hostel were Two Blade, a teacher from Philly I first met in Hot Springs; Silent Bob, a New Hampshirite who I knew as Bash or Dr Farts when he was hiking with Pukey in the south; and Fresh Prints, a bartender from Camden. Silent Bob had lost forty pounds from when I last saw him. Fresh Prints lost thirty pounds over his hike, though he looks like he's always been slim. Two Blade, like most women, lost little but redistributed the weight to muscle. UNICEF, already a lean climber, said he lost only two pounds. He was noticeably thinner, though, so it must have moved around for him too.
A dozen or more tween girls piled out of a shuttle and started setting up tents at Shaw's. High season for youth group backpacking. And time for us to get going! I found Hippie Chick, the owner of Shaw's along with her husband Poet, and arranged to leave my car for the week. 
UNICEF and I then stopped by the AT visitor center to sign in for summiting Katahdin. It's a way for hikers to avoid overcrowding, especially the Birches shelter at the base which has only 12 spots. We're shooting for August 4th, which gives us five full days to reach the base - still a challenge, since that's 112 miles away.
We got dropped off at the trailhead late in the afternoon with three section hikers - a father with two teen sons. We headed into the 100 Mile Wilderness with 6 days of food. A foreboding sign warns you to carry at least 10. It was a relatively easy three miles to the first shelter, with a confusing stream crossing right before. The shelter occupants called out to guide us across. Inside we found Deadweight and Ditzy from San Antonio. Southbound from Katahdin, they were on their tenth day in the Wilderness. They'd intended to thruhike, but were now planning to bail in Monson. They came totally unprepared: cotton clothes, dual burner campstove, and fifty pound backpacks. Their feet are killing them. They thought they'd be doing 24 miles a day out of the gate (in Maine!). Thoroughly chastened by the reality of the trail, they plan to learn from these lessons and try again next year, northbound from Georgia instead.
We continued hiking another mile around North Pond and found a couple of previously used stealth sites by a dammed stream off the pond. We discovered bedrock lay under a thin layer of duff when we tried to drive in the stakes, so we went stakeless and flyless. Over dinner - noodles for me, cold snacks for UNICEF, UNICEF explained how he's enjoyed hiking his own hike the last couple of months. But he's also looking forward to going home and back to rock climbing, piano, and his routine. We soaked our feet in the stream and scanned the pond for moose before bed. I didn't encounter one the last time I went through Maine two summers ago. Maybe this time?",,North Pond stealth site,"Jul 29, Mon",3.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624707,"Tough day. Up before 6 to a beautiful peaceful morning with loon calls. UNICEF and I hiked over 12 hours but came up short of Chairback Gap Shelter. Two years ago I made it from Monson to this shelter, 26 miles, starting at 9am. Wasn't feeling that strong this time.
UNICEF'S phone died this morning, taking all his ideas for children's books with it. Also his AWOL guide, which was on PDF only. I am now his eyes and ears (and camera).
Enjoyed conversation most of the day with Two Blade and Fresh Prints, who caught up after leaving Monson a couple hours after us, and UNICEF. Two Blade is a third grade teacher looking to switch to fifth grade. She served in the Peace Corps in Colombia, where her family is from. She was having a rough day with deer flies biting us as we forded a river, rashes from her sweaty shirt, and foot pain. 
At one point I was in the lead and ran across a Croc in the trail. Just one of a pair. I faced the same situation two years ago in Maine. I had carried the shoe to the next shelter, only to learn it probably belonged to a southbounder who was now many miles behind me. This time we left it where it was. But thirty yards on we found the other Croc, along with a washcloth. Content to reunite the small family we left them in the trail for their owner to hopefully return.
After a nice lunch we hit the Chairback range with several relatively short but killer climbs. It was here I had a little breakdown in 2017 climbing over countless boulders on Barren mountain, Fourth mountain, Mt Three and a Half, Third mountain, and more. UNICEF and I both had a difficult time today and couldn't keep pace on the steep downhills to reach the shelter before dark. The terrain, heavy packs from the large six-day resupply, and the heat and humidity slowed us down. There was also no water for ten critical miles except for a barely moving pool with yellow water. We had to drink copiously to replace the liters we sweated out, so water stops were frequent.
We finally reached a flowing stream after Third mountain, filled up, and found a stealth site nearby. Cooked some Ramen and went right to bed. Gonna sleep well tonight!",,West Chairback Pond stealth site,"Jul 30, Tue",20.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624708,"Better day - there were easier climbs over the last two Chairback peaks and the White Cap range. UNICEF and I crossed Katahdin Ironworks road, one of two private gravel lumber roads in the Wilderness where hikers can get a food drop, then forded the West Branch of the Pleasant River. I dropped the pack and went back to lay down in the shallow water and felt cool and wonderful until I dried off. Otherwise it was a fairly sweaty day.
We met about ten Quebec girls from a camp near Leeds hiking the Wilderness. They do a section of the Maine AT each year. This is their third and final section. We passed the first five on the trail giggling over something, then found the others at our lunch shelter, waiting for the trailing group to arrive because one was carrying the crew's lunch for the day - a plastic bag full of peanut butter. They laughed and chatted in French while I power-napped in the shelter. UNICEF was concerned he was pushing me too hard. It's certainly been more challenging after three months of relative inactivity than it was two years ago when I'd hiked from Harper's Ferry to get here, but I felt ready to go after an hour. An older section hiker was planning to spend the night here after getting a late morning food drop at KI road. He's headed for Katahdin on this trip which will complete the AT for him after four years.
We first saw Katahdin from White Cap mountain, a distant hump but clearly recognizable. UNICEF isn't an emotional guy but I could hear the conflict in his voice. He's got post-hike plans and is ready for it to end. But he'll miss the people and the adventure. One of the benefits of thruhiking is immersing yourself in the trail community, but that also means abruptly leaving it. Section hikers may only dip their toe in, but they get to come back again and again. 
We didn't reach the shelter until nearly seven, more than twelve hours after starting. Not sure how I pulled a 29 mile day in this section last time. 19 miles was more than enough today. There were two brothers tenting here sectioning the Wilderness. And a woman hiking a small section southbound from Jo-Mary road after climbing Katahdin with her husband and five kids. She hiked the southern half of the AT twenty years ago in college. She asked if we've seen Fireball, an old friend she heard was hiking nearby. He's a flip-flopper with a distinctive half gray, half black beard. UNICEF knows him well and thinks he's a day ahead.
Thunder crackled in the distance during the late afternoon and evening. It rained gently while we were climbing White Cap, perfect timing to cool us off. We opted to sleep in the shelter despite the bugs to avoid wet tents in the morning. It paid off, as the bugs kept their distance as the rain started pounding the metal roof in waves soon after dark.
Tomorrow should have far fewer climbs and become less rocky and rooty. I hope I remember correctly.",,Logan Brook Lean-To,"Jul 31, Wed",18.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624709,"I discovered a love for Maine's waters today. Two summer's ago, in my hurry to get to Katahdin, I lingered for a few moments at a perfect sandy white beach by a lake weighing whether to take a quick dip. I passed it up and have regretted it ever since. I'm not in such a rush this time. So today I swam in Crawford Pond, the swimming hole at Cooper Brook Falls Lean-To, and Lower Jo-Mary Lake. The waters were consistently cool and refreshing. Jo-Mary had a sandy beach. The swimming hole, on the other hand, had leeches. Two were on me when I got out but they came off easily. Disgusting if you think about it too much, but no big deal if you just go with the flow. Not only does swimming cool me off, it also keeps the bugs away for awhile. And soothes existing bug bites, of which there are many!
The terrain was flat and the trail largely pine needle with fewer rocks and roots. After two wearying days I wasn't as fatigued today, but my feet felt sore after twenty-plus miles. We've been pretty talkative the last two days but not as much today. Just a long day. 
There are beautiful lakes and tranquil evergreen woods. In some areas the understory is cleared and looks like old growth forest. We passed through private land, mostly logging territory, over Jo-Mary road, past many ponds and lakes. 
We ate lunch at Cooper Brook Falls Lean-To. UNICEF'S Smartwater bottle finally cracked after 2100 miles and untold abuse. Now that's a sturdy bottle! One most people throw away after a single use. But the water bottle was the second thing to fail today. His REI Flash sleeping pad sprung a slow leak overnight. It's a replacement for the same model that collapsed on him in North Carolina. It's widely known for leaking so probably lucky it lasted 1800 miles. Add in the fact that his phone bricked two days ago, and UNICEF deadpanned ""Valley, I'm coasting in on fumes!""
Leaving the shelter this morning I forgot to bring my water bottles, which I had just filled. Didn't realize until we were well down the trail. Took maybe ten minutes to jog back so it must have been nearly a mile. UNICEF waited patiently. He was also patient during all my swims. The water was too cool for him so he took a nap on the beach instead.
We saw a handful of section hikers, but the only new thruhiker was Silent Bob (formerly Bash or Doctor Farts) who we discovered tenting at the shelter this morning when he recognized UNICEF'S voice and called out. He left Monson a day after us and hiked 28 miles yesterday over the entire Chairback and White Cap ranges. Talk about a big day. Even so he paced us today and usually was well ahead. He intends to summit with us in three days. Another thruhiker with a long beard left the shelter before us but we didn't know him and never saw him again. 
At Jo-Mary a group of eight to ten girls were gathered. One of them showed up at the nearby lake while I was swimming and told us they were with a camp in Maine (not the one the Quebec girls hailed from). She's a counselor but is getting replaced today and heading out. The campers are hiking about 180 miles from the Bigelows to Katahdin. Pretty amazing camp experience.
At Nahmakanta Stream shelter another large youth group had taken over the shelter and filled the area with laughter and equipment. We were exhausted by then, so UNICEF, Silent Bob, and I tented away from the commotion on less than ideal spots. The bugs have been miserable today. Finally we can escape them.",,Nahmakanta Stream Lean-To,"Aug 01, Thu",27.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624710,"The terrain was tougher than yesterday's. No big climbs but the boulders, roots, and short climbs wore on me. Water was fairly regular, if sometimes warm.
UNICEF and I tore down our tents and left Nahmakanta Lean-To early. Silent Bob caught up and hiked with us for a few miles. His old co-workers back in Lebanon, New Hampshire have a map on the wall where they chart his progress. He started the trail with a friend and coworker who went by Pukey. I hiked with them both in North Carolina. Pukey was very social, liked staying in town and wasn't in a rush. Bob just wanted to hike, so eventually they parted ways. Bob's a gruff guy who keeps to himself, at least until you provoke him into a rant about one of his bugaboos. He's off-putting when you first meet him - and the second and third time - but he eventually grows on you. He's one of a handful of hikers who've been near UNICEF for almost 2000 miles.
I stopped at a beach on Nahmakanta Lake after five miles for a relaxing swim in the cool water while the others moved on to break at a shelter. The lake was deserted but for a duck which glided slowly through the water and methodically cleaned itself. Thruhikers don't pack towels, but I was content to air-dry on the shore. I was utterly alone, likely no one for miles. Just silence, the water, the trees, the mountains, and the sky above.
By lunchtime at the next Lean-To I was wiped out from a series of climbs around the lake and up Rainbow Stream.  We found Two Blade and Fresh Prints there after losing them for two nights. They, along with Silent Bob, plan to summit on Sunday with us. A Chinese-Canadian northbounder named Hobbit walked through as I was bathing in the brook. There was also a family from Maine hanging out who hike the Wilderness every year. The father thrued in 2006.
Two Blade and I chatted as we all walked out. She's eager to finish so she can visit and relax with friends and family. She'll be looking for a teaching job in Philly later this month, hopefully with a charter school.
Soon we came across a sleeping bag next to the trail. It's the second sleeping bag I've stumbled across on the AT.  Like the bag I found two years ago in New York, when I had foolishly left my own at home, it was a heavy car camping bag, and it was abandoned far from any road, campsite, or person. Unlike the other one, this was dry and neatly rolled up, suggesting that it may have been left recently. We let it be since there was no way to know if its owner went south or north.
With about six miles left UNICEF and I stopped along Rainbow Lake. There was no beach, just a collection of huge, half-submerged boulders with waves lapping against them. UNICEF lay on the rocks while I slipped in for another swim. I love the clear and peaceful waters up here. They cool me down and deter the bugs for awhile. It's idyllic. No sign of civilization yet perfectly comfortable.
On the way out UNICEF felt a blister pop. It's his first blister since Georgia. His bandages got wet at some point and were useless, so I fished out some supplies for him. ""I'm coasting in on fumes!"", he laughed, adding a blistered foot to his bricked phone, deflated sleeping pad, and busted water bottle.
More climbs over Rainbow Ledges.  Ripe blueberries were all over the summit begging to be picked. Two Blade was already on it. We spend a half hour slowly working our way across while consuming hundreds of the pea-sized fruits. While they didn't approach the size of cultivated blueberries, they were so much juicier and sweeter. We kept promising ourselves this was our last one, only to stop again to gather another handful.
More tiring miles to the shelter. We've done 93 miles in four days through some tough terrain and it's worn us down. I've been drinking and eating more but still tired. We found the Hurd Brook Lean-To across a boulder-strewn brook. The shelter was empty, but there were a dozen teenage boys from Maine's Camp Kieve gathered nearby. They are the boy counterpart to the girls at last night's shelter. Both groups are hiking 22 days on the AT from the Bigelows to Katahdin. They're only a couple days from finishing. Their counselor is a very upbeat and friendly bearded college guy. He told us the boys are really gung-ho to finish and are basically self-managing by this point.
Most of the others chose to tent, but Hobbit dropped by the shelter to chat. UNICEF has traveled in China so they had lots to discuss. Love of dumplings was mutual. Hobbit regretted that there are no long hiking trails in China. It's not really part of the culture he opined. He'll have to return to Canada to renew his visa soon. He started the AT in February. When he reached Vermont in early May he flew west to hike the first 800 miles of the PCT to Kearsarge Pass in the Sierra Nevada, then came back east to finish the AT. After he renews his visa he'll finish the PCT this year too!
Two Blade, Silent Bob, and UNICEF have been worrying about getting spots in the Birches shelter at the foot of Katahdin tomorrow. It's the only place to overnight near Katahdin that doesn't require an impossible-to-get reservation, but it's limited to the first twelve thruhikers each night (a thruhiker being anyone who's come 100 miles or more). I was nervous my first time too, but the rangers were very accommodating, making sure everyone found a place to sleep. Still, we'll be up early not only to register for the Birches, but also to partake of the breakfast buffet at the Abol Bridge campstore.",,Hurd Brook Lean-To,"Aug 02, Fri",25.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624711,"We got out early to reach Abol Bridge to register for the Birches and get the breakfast buffet. I learned the hard way that Hurd Brook Lean-To's ""baseball bat"" floor is noted by AWOL as more of a warning than an interesting feature. It's a row of two-inch round, knotty pine logs. Makes sleeping on a standard wood plank shelter floor feel downright luxurious.
The hike to Abol had a few climbs, rocks, and roots, so the Wilderness didn't let go easily. The bugs swarmed UNICEF and I as we approached the Golden Road. Then a series of trucks hauling boats and rafts sped past us kicking up clouds of dust. After admiring the view of Katahdin at Abol Bridge, we dumped the packs at the campground store, a plain-looking building, and jogged the mile or so to the Baxter Park boundary to register for the Birches shelter. There's only space for 12 thruhikers (defined as hiking at least 100 miles into Baxter, so I qualified). I've been assuring UNICEF, Silent Bob, Two Blade, and Fresh Prints for days that it won't be a problem to get in. But when we arrived at the board at 7:30 am there were already nine names on the list. Fortunately Silent Bob, Two Blade, and Fresh Prints were three of them. The last one, Fargo, was still there. He's a thruhiker, but new to us. The first five names got there at 6am, after staying at the Abol campground. We recognize none of the names. Hobbit will later be the last name. That means everyone at our shelter who wanted a spot got one. The Camp Kieve group had reservations and the others at Hurd Brook were headed to Millinocket. Anyone who started before Hurd Brook and goes this far is out of luck.
So we sprinted back to the campstore with Fargo, humming the triumphant Chariots of Fire theme. The breakfast buffet awaited. For $10 it was similar to a hot buffet at a mid-range motel with bagels, sausage, circular egg patties, yogurt, coffee, danishes, OJ, etc. But after 100 miles and five days it felt like a five-star restaurant. We all - Fresh Prints, UNICEF, Two Blade, Hobbit, and Silent Bob - ate ourselves into a food coma and collapsed outside on the concrete porch when the restaurant closed at 9. 
Our plan was to take out lunch when the restaurant reopened at 11. Meanwhile some of us obtained an expensive but sugary resupply from the store. Around 10:30 a Baxter ranger walked up. He was concerned that we signed up for the Birches but came back here. We were supposed to sign up then keep moving north. According to Captain Baxter, Bob's nickname for our earnest interlocutor, we are permitted to meander as long as we like on the ten miles between the board and the Birches, but we can't go back here, the only spot with food near or in Baxter. We try to explain that everyone got a spot and no-one has been left out, which he acknowledges. But it's not fair in principle, he explains, because hypothetically someone who didn't care about the breakfast buffet and walked straight through should take precedence. It makes no sense. But he insists we pack up and move on. I slip away to a picnic table some ways off, irked by his intransigence and determined to pack out more food. 
I chat with a couple of women finishing their section hikes of the AT. They were at Hurd with us but decided to camp here at Abol tonight and take another day to get to the Birches. They relate seeing a moose in a lake in Maine very close to a shelter. So close in fact that the youth group that was cooking there all scrambled up onto the roof when the moose wouldn't go away. The video is fascinating as the moose calmly chews grass with the kids watching from the roof.
Once the restaurant opens I carry out lunch and dinner, intending to share some with the others who moved on. The hike is really a stroll along the Penobscot and Neswadnehunk rivers. I catch up to the group at a waterfall where they're lounging on a giant boulder. I take a dip in the cool water and slide over the slippery ledges with the falls into a lagoon. A group of whitewater rafters march up to the falls and take turns falling backwards into the churning waters and going over the falls. They have water shoes, life vests, and helmets on. I have hiking shorts.
We decamp and stroll a few more miles to Little Niagara Falls where we rest on a boulder towering twenty feet above a lagoon. On the other side the river is a rapid heading for a rough, steep waterfall. I soak myself while gripping the rocks lest I'm swept away over what is definitely not an attractive rock slide. There's a wonderful view of one of Katahdin's peaks looking upriver over the rapids. A mother and grandmother sit by the edge of a side pool with a naked baby boy, letting him enjoy the water.
We hike the last three miles, passing Daicey and Grassy Ponds, feeling a bit worn down despite an easy day. We see several southbounders and flip-floppers pass, having just come down Katahdin. Finally we reach the ranger station at Katahdin Stream Campground. A drum and guitar circle is playing nearby. We wait 45 minutes but no ranger appears to take our payments for the Birches. So I lead the way over to the shelter.
It's just as I remember. Two Adirondack shelters, but only four of us opt to use them. Everyone else tents. Two Blade starts a fire with birch bark, then breaks out S'mores supplies she bought at the campstore. I share a shelter with Dreamer, a 70-ish Santa Claus look-a-like from New Hampshire who hiked from Hanover over the last two months. He's eager to do a thruhike now. A sixtyish guy named Adventure Boy is completing a section from Harriman State Park in New York which finishes the AT for him. A guy from Augusta, Georgia named T is finishing a section of Maine. He was ready to quit at Abol but he called home and his wife told him he better climb ""that mountain"" first! Fargo is a thruhiker still in his twenties from South Dakota (whoever named him didn't know their geography). Finally there's a retired couple from San Francisco who sectioned the PCT over a decade ago and are finishing a seven-year section hike of the AT tomorrow. The woman's name is Energizer Turtle or ET, the same unusual name as the Canadian I met in the Smokies. It's an enjoyable evening around the campfire as everyone looks forward to the final day.",,The Birches,"Aug 03, Sat",13.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624713,"Up at the usual time before 5:30. Dreamer's already gone. UNICEF and I head off at 6 with full packs. Unlike last time I can't leave anything at the ranger station since we intend to descend the other side of Katahdin. I forgot to dump trash yesterday, so I get to carry up a huge bag of junk as well.
It's cool and deserted as we climb the Hunt trail. We pass the San Francisco couple, Spider and Energizer Turtle, then Adventure Boy, a sixty-year-old retired environmental engineer from Florida who hiked from New York. The bridge at Katahdin Stream is out but the crossing is easy enough to rock hop. Still, there's a long re-route for the less intrepid hikers.
No other hikers are out this early. Dayhikers can't even drive into the park until six. As we reach treeline and the trail turns to huge boulders and opens up to a panoramic view, Fargo and Hobbit catch us. Both are slackpacking, having left most of their stuff at the ranger station. The climb is rigorous and fantastic, as great as I remember. UNICEF smacks his head on a rock at one point. ""Coasting in on fumes!"" he calls. We reach the Tableland before I expect, where Dreamer is waiting. The last mile passes slowly over Alpine tundra as UNICEF and I continue bantering. The Kieve camp boys pass us going back down. They've finished their three-week trek! 
Finally the peak is in sight. T, the Georgia flip-flopper, is already coming down. I make way for UNICEF to reach the peak first, he's earned it. Photos galore follow. I pose slumped over the sign, seated Namaste yoga-style on top, using my poles as a bow and arrow, and more silliness. The others follow suit.
Dreamer, Fargo, Hobbit, Adventure Boy, Silent Bob, Fresh Prints, and Two Blade all join us eventually. We celebrate and congratulate each other and get a group photo. After an hour we go our separate ways to catch rides, retrieve bags, or, in our case, add a little extra adventure.
UNICEF and I hike over the Knife Edge, a ridge of jumbled rocks less than ten yards wide in most places and sometimes as narrow as a few feet. It winds up and down over East Peak and over to Pamola Peak, with a very steep notch called the Chimney near the end. We stop to let some dayhikers pass as they struggle to get down a dicey section. UNICEF suggests popcorn. It takes us over an hour and a half to go 1.1 miles. Tortuously slow, but fun!
The descent off the ridge to Roaring Brook Campground and our exit is simply tortuous. The Helen Taylor trail, apparently named after Percival Baxter's least favorite wife, is a monstrously steep trail that almost never relents from the rocky and bouldery descent. Far better to climb this beast than descend it. The 3.2 miles seem to go on forever. Two and a half hours for that distance seems like forever at least.
Down at the campground at last around 2:30 we struggle to find any hikers returning to their cars who can drive us to Millinocket. Eventually elderly siblings Shirley and Keith agree to take us out. They are initially suspicious of UNICEF'S story, saying he looks too clean to be a thruhiker! Keith is from Hawaii, and back in Maine due to their father's death. He hiked much of the Katahdin area and other parts of Maine and New Hampshire decades ago and is well-versed in hiker lingo like LASH. Our enjoyable conversation ends when Shirley kindly drops us at the Appalachian Trail Lodge in Millinocket.
We both get bunks and I buy into the shuttle to Monson tomorrow morning. OleMan is still presiding there with the same gleam in his eye. He even recognizes me from two years ago! Quite the host.
We grab dinner at the Scootic Inn with Adventure Boy and T, then ice cream down the street. I'm stuffed from eating so much at once. UNICEF finds Fireball at the hostel, a flip-flopper he'd been hiking with for awhile. There are a smattering of other flip-floppers, southbounders, and section hikers including at least one former thruhiker from 2017 named Cowboy. There is a father and son pair staying for a few days. The father messed up his knee fourteen miles into the Wilderness and hiked out in great pain.
It's luxurious to lie on a mattress after six nights in the woods. This has been my longest stretch of hiking between towns, my longest stretch between showers, between town food of any kind, and without cell service. I think I held up pretty well, but good company helped a lot. I still prefer the El Camino / English / Swiss hiking method of inn-to-inn, but the occasional stretch lost in the wilderness helps calm the soul.",,Katahdin,"Aug 04, Sun",5.20
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624718,"Woke at the usual 5:15 and had breakfast at the Appalachian Trail Cafe on Millinocket's deserted main street. UNICEF, Adventure Boy, T, Fireball, ET and Spider, Dreamer and his wife all joined in. ET and Spider made it to Baxter Peak just minutes before noon when Dreamer, who had been waiting on them out of concern, planned to leave. He then followed us across the Knife Edge. UNICEF and I signed a ceiling tile for the AT class of 2019. 
Back at the hostel I packed up and said goodbyes. UNICEF is headed to Portland, Maine to stay with family friends for a few days, then to his father's place in Texas for awhile. His father, who's hardly ever been outside his Texas hometown, is using a small inheritance to take them both on a world cruise in a few months. After that UNICEF may return to Boulder for work and possibly save up to attend a prestigious concept design school in Singapore. He's eager to get into drawing now that the trail is done. He does nothing by half-measures. 
I board the shuttle to Monson with OleMan and three hikers starting the 100 Mile Wilderness. One was a 2006 thruhiker who recalled taking a relaxed 10 days to really enjoy the Wilderness. OleMan gave me some background on Baxter Park's fraught relationship with the ATC. The current thruhiker permitting went in after Scott Jurek broke the fastest hike record in 2011 and flouted Baxter's warnings by popping champagne at the peak in front of a TV crew. Not only did it violate the spirit and letter of Baxter Park's wilderness mandate (specified in Percival Baxter's deed), but the alcohol on the rocks attracted bears and bees to the summit during that dry summer and created a real nuisance.
OleMan and his wife Navigator took over the Appalachian Trail Lodge in 2006 at the end of his thruhike. They had worked at Hiker Hostel in Georgia for years and were looking for an affordable big red barn near the trail in Virginia to start their own hostel. The real estate market was too pricey then, but the elderly Millinocket hostel owner liked them and made them a deal they couldn't refuse. They fixed up the dilapidated home and cafe and they became instant successes. One of their innovations was dropping off food for hikers in the Wilderness. This enabled southbounders in particular to head out without needing to pack out ten days of food. OleMan told me the SOBO retention rate through the Wilderness jumped from 20% to 85% after that.
After dropping off the hikers at the beginning of the Wilderness we went to Shaw's for my car. OleMan's daughter Hippy Chick runs the place with her husband Poet. OleMan walked in and with a big smile picked up his two-year-old granddaughter who was waiting at the door to the gear shop and eating a frozen fruit pop. This is a family that loves what they do and does it together.
I walked over to the AT visitor center to see who else had passed through. Spruce Lee and Shiitake - who was off-trail for awhile with a knee problem - wrote that they plan to summit on the 7th. So glad to see they made it. I searched for Fast Lane but he wasn't listed. He's not the type to advertise I guess, but I'm certain he already passed through. The staffer gave me a map to Gulf Hagas in the Wilderness which I contemplated dayhiking. I had planned to walk it as a side trip last week but the first two days hiking the Chairbacks were tough enough without the extra six miles!
Back at the car I pondered what to do. With limited service I'd texted all the hikers I knew who were still out there but I hadn't heard back, so I didn't know how to find them. Hiking Gulf Hagas and maybe doing trail magic in the Wilderness was attractive but I expected the people I knew had already passed that point. Then a heavily-burdened hiker walked by from Shaw's so I called him over and offered him a ride. He was a dark-bearded, intense guy with a twinkle in his eye named Prometheus who had thrued in 2010 and had started in Vermont this year. His pack was full of beer and liquor to provide trail magic to other hikers as he hiked the Wilderness. I dropped him and his ginormous pack at the trailhead several miles north of town.
From there I headed north to Greenville thinking I'd meander west to New Hampshire. But that just took me further into the remote North Woods. I found a small public beach and took a swim in Moosehead Lake, and picked up plenty of Moxie at a rare supermarket for the family back home.
New plan: Head for Franconia Notch in the Whites. I learned that Tin Can, a kid I met in Fontana before the Smokies and who is headed for the Peace Corps, will be hitting it tomorrow. Scrub-a-Dub and Go-Gurt may also be in that stretch. I'll stop in Gorham for the night on the way there.
Rural western Maine is beautiful and, except for all the evergreens, reminds me a bit of backcountry Pennsylvania. I speed up between towns then slow down through places like Skowhegan, Farmington, and Bethel. I pass roads leading to AT highlights like Caratunk, Stratton, Rangeley, Andover, and Grafton Notch. I wish I could revisit them all! 
In Gorham I grab fast food for dinner. I haven't been particularly hungry today. My fellow hikers put away huge breakfasts while I nibbled on an egg sandwich. A Big Mac is plenty now. If I'd been hiking for a few weeks though it would just be the warm up act.
At the Rattle River trailhead outside town I meet thruhiker Tricon, who's taking the day off to do trail magic. A sixtyish thruhiker named Sped is just parting. He started March 7th but I don't remember seeing him down south. He's concerned about rain. My forecast (wonder of wonders I have service!) shows yet another clear day tomorrow. It's been a fantastic week for weather.
Walking up the trail southbound towards the first shelter where I intend to spend the night, I greet a thruhiker and a guy with a daypack. I do a double take, as does the daypacker. It's Mudturkey! I last saw him in North Carolina before he left trail due to shin splints. He returned after a few weeks and is doing great now. He's slackpacking the Carter range, a 20-mile strenuous section from Pinkham Notch which I had dayhiked as well (with full pack, in case I had to tent). Anyway, what a coincidence to bump into Mudturkey at this random trailhead I picked!
The Rattle River shelter is only two miles from the road, by the river. The walk through the forest is easy, cool and buggy. Like walking on air after Katahdin! The shelter is, not surprisingly, empty. Any northbounder reaching it would likely continue on to Gorham. I use the evening to catch up on my journal.",,Rattle River Shelter,"Aug 05, Mon",1.90
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624720,"Left Rattle River shelter in morning twilight and hiked the two miles to route 2, reaching my car about 6:10. Today's plan was to visit thruhikers I'd known down South who were still on trail. But Fast Lane is deep in the 100 Mile Wilderness, ET is in the Bigelows, and Scrub-a-Dub and Go-Gurt just entered the Presidential range. Reaching any of them is nearly impossible. It was dumb luck I bumped into Mudturkey last night. Only Tin Can is in a town, spending the night near Lincoln. I figure he'll hit Franconia Ridge today. Since it's gorgeous weather and Franconia has fantastic views that seems a good place to spend the day even if I miss him. It's an hour-and-a-half drive to the Flume visitor lot in Franconia Notch State Park. The park was famous for the Old Man on the Mountain, a high rocky crag that looked like a silhouette of a head. It became a symbol of the Granite State, but it collapsed about ten years ago. The tourists still come for the flumes, and the hikers still come for the challenging climbs and open summits.
I'm starting pretty early so I probably won't see Tin Can until I turn around and start down. The climb to Liberty Springs is long, steep, rocky, and sweaty. But after Katahdin it's not too great a challenge. Still, the total elevation gain to Mt Lafayette, the highest summit, is only a few hundred feet less than Katahdin. 
Plenty of dayhikers about, as well as some backpackers doing the Pemi Loop. Few elect the side trail to Mt Liberty, though the view there is excellent. I have the summit to myself. The alpine trail to Lafayette is busier. It's entirely exposed for several miles, with views to Mt Washington and in every other direction. I see no thruhikers or section hikers.
On Lafayette two runners stop to chat. They've run the Pemi Loop in under nine hours. I've no idea how far that is, but two backpackers earlier told me they were hiking it in four days. The terrain is very rough and goes over many 4000-footers. The AT covers about half of the loop, so I know first-hand it's no joke. A group of macho dayhikers, clearly not impressed, comments after the runners leave how the record is under six hours. Nevermind they themselves probably took most of six hours just to climb Mt Lafayette.
Pausing on Mt Lafayette I check Tin Can's text again. Unfortunately I had misread it. He was overnighting in Lincoln, but he'd come in from north of Mt Moosilauke, not from Franconia Notch. So he'd be hiking Kinsman Ridge today, not Franconia. Since I'm not going to see him I decide to take another way down. It drops steeply down through open alpine tundra past Greenleaf Hut before plunging below treeline. It's the Helen Taylor trail of the White Mountains. Steep, boulderly, and exhausting. The folks I pass seem to agree. Eventually it relents and I come out at a parking area three miles north of the car. So I follow a paved bike path south for the easiest miles I've walked in over a week.
Back at the car after about 14 miles in seven hours, I change and pull out to head for North Woodstock and a milkshake. Across from the Flume visitor center entrance I spot two hikers looking for a ride. Well, they're not difficult to spot because they're dancing around like goofballs, and cheer loudly when I pull over. I get out to help with their packs and start to introduce myself when my jaw drops. One of the hikers is Tin Can! He and his buddy Jolly just finished slackpacking Kinsman Ridge. Seventeen miles of nasty terrain and it's only three o' clock. ""We were killin' it!"" cries Jolly. I drive them down to The Notch hostel outside North Woodstock, catching up along the way. Tin Can seems to be having a great time. He heads off to Guinea for his Peace Corps stint in December. 
I'm flabbergasted that I accidentally ran into both Tin Can and Mudturkey. There are few people I remember as well as them. And it can't be taken for granted that they are both still on trail. Most hikers I met in the South dropped off long ago. It's a great way to cap off my day in the Whites, and a fitting send-off as I travel home from Katahdin.
The milkshake helps too.",,View Entry,"Aug 06, Tue",0
