Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558014,"T-3 days. The text of this post probably isn't going to communicate the excitement very well because of being swamped with everything that needs to get done before I leave.The plan is to leave MD Friday directly after work and the ballooning program meeting. Ashley is road tripping me down to GA, so Friday night we'll drive until we get tired (with the goal of making it 4-5hours to southern VA), and then do the rest of the drive Saturday morning. We'll meet my sister at the trail head and she'll day hike with us for a little bit before turning back. Ashley is going to camp the first night on the approach trail, maybe snap a pic at the start of the AT on Sunday, and then head back to the car and to MD.This is mostly a test post, but a couple things of note:- I'm just about completely moved out of my apartment... just have one box left to move. The place is alot bigger without my stuff in it...- Indoor camping (sleeping pad/bag on floor) is, for whatever reason, far less comfortable than outdoor camping.- I did a shakedown hike with Ashley at Ramsey's Draft in VA a couple of weeks ago. It went well, temps were in the 30s during the day and the low 20s at night, but we both stayed mostly warm. I'm hoping to not see temperatures that low because they're pushing the limits of my 20deg sleeping bag and extra layers, but I could go a little lower without it becoming miserable. I'm still debating weather to start with my 20deg sleeping bag or 30deg quilt. The quilt is alot lighter, but the bag is warmer. GA is south, but I'll be up in the mountains. Presumably I'll make a decision in the next 3 days.- I made a new alcohol stove last night, YAC stove design. Burns beautifully... flame around the whole circumference, but I did accidentally poke a hole in the side so there's an extra tongue of flame that comes out the side. Also, sanding it to remove the paint after assembly didn't work too well. Not sure if those are enough of a reason to make a new stove, we'll see what I have time for this week. I think I've decided on alcohol stove over canister stove, but the pocketrocket will be in the support gear if I need it. Also, protip, adding fuel to a lit stove is a terrible decision (which I already knew, but have now verified).",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Tue",0
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558093,"T-2days. We're getting there... finished packing support boxes today and the last box of my possessions is packed and ready for storage. I also have all my gear ready (see picture)... just need to implode it into my pack. Made a new stove today, figured it was better to do that than to use the one I made last night that had the extra flame coming out the side. Also, I think I've pretty much decided to go with the 20deg sleeping bag. It's another 1.5lbs, but it'll be better to be warm than to not be. I can always trade out if I don't need it, but it'll be better to have it. Spent a good amount of the evening at ballooning helping them get all the ground-to-balloon and payload-to-payload communications working and transferring as much knowledge of the ground system software as I could. Just have one rocksat (sounding rocket payload) meeting left tomorrow evening and one general balloon meeting (to say goodbye to everyone) left. Work is also closing out, a few more loose ends to tie up/pass off with the software and then I'm done. One of my coworkers did give me a ""travel-sized"" box of Old Bay as a going away present... I'm not normally a huge fan, but the trail changes taste buds and seasoning is essential for trail food, so, in the bag it goes.",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Wed",0
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558221,"Another busy day... work, another rocksat meeting, watched SpaceX launch and re-land a reused rocket, and then had a wonderful evening hanging out with a friend: grabbed dinner, watched a poetry/music open-mic night at Busboys and Poets, and hung out until late.Seems like word about the trip is getting around DCUL thanks to K^2... heard from B~~~ (thru hiker 20years ago) and HeavyD (Long Trail hiking buddy) with congrats/have fun/advice messages, which was appreciated.Sorry, not much hiking/preparation related stuff today, mostly just getting ready to leave. Hopefully some real content once the roadtrip starts tomorrow!",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Thu",0
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558508,"Aaaand we're off! Had my last day of work today including a great going-away lunch with a bunch of co-workers at an Indian buffet. Then dropped off the last of my apartment stuff at storage, and attended my last ballooning meeting. The ballooning program gave me an SSL and a UMD aerospace engineering polo shirt as a going away present, which was super nice of them. They'll be a nice addition to the work wardrobe (in 5 months).Spent much longer than intended saying goodbye to all my friends there... To my (mock) chagrin the process involved confetti and party hats. After lots of hugs I headed back to my appt one last to pick up a load of laundry and to shave (starting the trail with a blank slate), drove over to pick up Ashley, and headed out. We made it to Roanoke, VA and found a cheap hotel at 2am, exhausted and only still awake because of the Disney songs we were blasting. Long day, but the ball is rolling.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Fri",0
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558513,"At 6am, after only 3 hours of sleep, we rolled out of bed, grabbed a couple waffles from the hotel's breakfast, and hit the road again. We stopped for a quick haircut (last easy access to a barber for a while) on the way through Johnson City, NC. After passing Asheville and heading into the Smoky Mountains/Nantahala National Forest the gray clouds finally gave way to clear blue skies and the temperature rose to 65F. We stopped at the NOC, an outdoor center at NOBO (northbound) mile 137 of the AT as we drove though and stopped for a few minutes. I was a bit jealous of all the thru hikers lounging in the sun, already a couple weeks into their journey, enjoying some trail magic (any act of kindness given to a hiker) in the form of cookies and fruit. Hopeful the weather is as nice and some trail angels (people who provide trail magic) are around when I get there. We finished up the drive to Amicola State Park and arrived to find the place SWARMING with people, mostly families and day hikers out to enjoy Georgia's largest waterfall. We met up with my sister, who had driven up from Atlanta to hike for the day with us and then began our preparations. The approach trail begins with a stone arch and a sign proclaiming 2189 miles to Mt Katahdin, ME and was manned by a ranger who singled me out at someone who looked ready to hike to Maine. I signed in, NOBO hiker #1456 for 2017, weighed my pack (27lbs including 4 days of food and a liter of water), and at ~2pm started up the 608 steps that lead to the top of the falls. Personally I didn't think the steps were as bad as most accounts said they were, and we were soon up them and crossed the top of the falls. Thankfully the crowds thinned as soon as we got into the woods and soon it was just the three of us. My sister hiked with Ashley and I for ~3 miles before turning back towards her car.Along the way we saw several runners who were participating in the 70mi trail run race, which seems like a crazy idea, even to the guy hiking to Maine. We reached camp at ~630pm, Ashley and I setup our hammock and tent, made dinner and talked with a few of the other hikers, enjoyed the sunset which looked like a fire through the trees, and headed to bed promptly at hiker midnight, ready to catch up on some of the sleep we had missed the night before.PS For anyone reading this journal who is not a regular member of the hiking community. When hiking a long distance trail it's common to take a new name, a trail name. Trail names are earned while hiking, usually in relation to a humorous event or related to a distinctive feature of the person they describe. They're useful for a couple of reasons... in hiking you meet lots of people that you only see handful of times, so a distinctive name is much quicker to learn and the name (and the story they're derived from) gives you a bit of insight about a person when you meet them. A distinctive name is also useful for uniquely identifying a person... imagine along people if they've seen John who might be 50 miles ahead of you. Some examples of trail names from people I know back home are Faceplant, UTurn, Beer Angel, etc. I earned the name Crusher (give me a can of beer and I'll show you how) which is why I sign my posts with it. I earned that name with DCUL on a weekend hike on the AT 2 years ago, and may see if I earn a new name on this hike.","
",Black gap shelter,"Apr 01, Sat",7.70
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558540,"We slept in this morning until about 8am (sunrise was 630), which meant that we got a wonderful 11 hours of sleep to make up for the day before. We had already filtered water the night before, so we ate a quick breakfast, packed up, and hit the trail ahead of most of the 20-30 other hikers at the shelter. The climb to Springer Mt passed quickly, and we soon came to the clearing at the top. The start of the AT is marked by 2 placks, one denoting a hiker and the other showing a map of the east coast with the trail marked. The clearing also contains the first white blaze which mark the way all the way to Maine.We traded taking pictures with the placks with a couple of other hikers, before I said goodbye to Ashley and headed north at 910am. The trail passed Springer Mt shelter, which was still FULL of hikers preparing for their day, before winding down to a parking lot where everyone who doesn't hike the approach trail parks. At the parking lot, only 0.9mi into the journey I got my first TRAIL MAGIC!!! from a guy who had the back of his car STUFFED with everything a hiker could need (and might've forgotten) ... Bugspray, fuel cannisters, water, coffee, snacks, and more. Having all the gear I needed, I took only an oatmeal creme cookie and a juicebox, which were all the more delicious because I didn't have to carry them. The snack itself wasn't as big a deal as the fact that someone had woken up early (probably earlier than most of the hikers), driven to the top of a mountain, and was giving all this stuff to struggling hikers they didn't know and won't see again. Pretty cool person.After leaving the bustling parking lot I decended into some rhotodendron thickets which provided some much appreciated relief from the morning sun which would bake us for most of the day, the barren trees above not providing much protection. I passed a guy with a skateboard tied to his pack (that's a trail name waiting to happen, if it hasn't already), before meeting a guy and a girl, Hulk and GPS (I'll let you guess which was which (HINT: you probably got it wrong)), who I chatted with while hiking for a couple hours. The trail was still fairly busy and we passed a group of girls on a trip to earn their PE credit for the semester at UGA, a couple of families, as well as several other Thrus. Eventually they stopped to fix Hulk's shoe and I continued on ahead and shortly ran into ANOTHER TRAIL MAGIC!! A couple of trucks had setup tables, chairs, and more food than an army could eat at a forest road crossing. Spoon and Lookout, two Thrus I had briefly met at camp the night before, were taking a break to enjoy the treats. I had some strawberries, peanut butter crackers, a bag of chips, and a Snickers and rested a while before grabbing a bag of jellybeans, an apple, and filling my water bottles for later. After thanking the trail angels I heading out with Spoon and Lookout.We chatted as we hiked for a couple miles before reaching Hawk Mt shelter, my intended destination for the day, a little before noon. While we had all intended to sleep there, we decided that we didn't feel like sitting around all afternoon and that the next shelter (6mi away) was a good target. After tanking up (the next 4mi would be dry) we started down the trail before meeting a ridgerunner, one of the 3 rangers stationed along the first ~30mi of the trail to make sure no inexperienced hikers did anything too stupid. We chatted with him and learned that the rain that we had heard was going to hit Monday afternoon was now forcasted into severe thunderstorms, potentially including hail, and that 60 people had passed him thus far that day and were heading for the same shelter we were. We thanked him for the info and headed out, having decided that we wanted to push to Neels Gap (which has a hostel, cabins, resupply, and pizza/beer) before the storm hit Monday afternoon so that we can sleep inside that night. That goal, combined with the lack of space at the next shelter, the bear canister requirement at the shelter after, the fact that the whole trail knows there's weather coming and is also heading to Neels (which can accommodate a limited number of hikers), and the fact that Blood Mt, a 4400ft peak, is between us and Neels and probably isn't safe to traverse in a storm, meant that we had to reach Gooch Gap tonight so that we could do the 11.5mi to Blood Mt before the weather turns and the 14mi to Neels Gap before the spots sell out.Lookout and I cruised for the rest of the afternoon, getting a bit more TRAIL MAGIC in the form of a potable water tank that someone had placed in Sasafras gap that we topped off our water from. We stopped in briefly at the shelter (which had all 22 tent sites around it already full) to talk to the ridgerunner there and fill up on water for the night. There we met a guy from South Africa who had gotten off a plane 2 days ago, gone to REI in Altanta, bought all his gear, and started the trail, which will be pretty impressive if he makes it.We finished our 19mi day at ~6pm, cooked dinner, hung our food, and headed to bed. We'll be up early tomorrow to start our miles. At Neels I'll be picking up a hat to protect against the sun/rain, a pen, a refill on sunscreen (the bottle I brought was almost empty), and topping off my food to get me to the Top of Georgia hostel (which provides shuttles into Hiawasse, which is probably going to be the next resupply).","Black gap shelter
",Gooch Gap,"Apr 02, Sun",18.60
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558641,"So, my thru hike of the Appalachian River is going swimmingly. The morning started early, well before sunrise, as we both awoke at 5am. I grabbed a quick breakfast of oatmeal, powdered milk, and freeze dried blueberries, and we hit the trail at 530am. I hiked with the help of my headlamp, Lookout with his phone (he had forgotten batteries for his headlamp), through the early morning. The fog rolled in shortly after we started hiking and soon had reduced seeing to tens of feet ahead. As we walked our talking startled something, not sure if it was a bear, boar, or deer... But it sounded large and clumsy. We waited for it to clear the trail, apologized for disturbing it in very loud voices until it had moved on, and continued on our way. The rain started shortly after, first sporadic drops before becoming more consistent but still light. The morning light had just started to faintly sillouette the trees as we reached Woody Gap. The rain starting so early had unnerved us... The Plan had us over blood mountain before it started, which obviously hadn't happened. We reluctantly decided to push on anyways, the other option was to hitch out of Woody Gap into town, take a zero, and come back tomorrow to do this stretch, but we didn't like the prospects of trying to hitch before dawn, it was very early on the trail to take a zero, and we'd still have to go over Blood Mt when it was wet tomorrow. We started hiking and it want long until the rain started coming down heavily and the wind picked up. Lookout had discovered that the cabins took reservations and had left a message last night requesting a reservation, so we stopped briefly at 8am to call the cabins and see what had become of that request. Turns out NONE of the hikers who had stayed there the night before we're leaving, so they were full. So much for The Plan. Despite no longer having a place to stay on the other side, we had to continue, since we were in an area which required campers to use a bear can (or face a $2000 fine and an angry bear). We pushed on, the rain ranging from moderate to heavy throughout the morning, but made surprisingly good time, reaching the trail leading up blood at 10am. As we ascended blood mountain the rain intensified and the trail began to take on water, becoming more of a puddle than a trail. We reached the summit by 1045am and took a quick break at the stone shelter at the top, where we met Matt^2 (2 guys both named Matt) who were taking lunch. We decided to push into Neels Gap rather than stopping at the shelter and not moments after leaving the shelter, the first crack of thunder ripped through the sky. We rapidly decided that the top of a 4400ft bald mountain was the last place we wanted to be, and started ""moving quickly"" down the mountain. The rain was pouring down and we didn't even need the blazes to tell the way, the gushing river a much clearer marker. We passed several newly formed unreliable springs as we decended into the tree line, the thunder and lightning still prevalent. I have new appreciation for the term soaked to the bone, being wetter than I've ever been before. We stopped briefly to empty out the couple inches of water that had accumulated in the bottom of our pack covers throughout the morning but finished our fastest 2 miles of the AT yet by arriving at Mountain Outfitters in Neels Gap. Leaving our soaked packs outside, we went inside and called one of the places on their phone list and managed to score 2 of the 3 remaining beds in a cabin at Misty Mountain Cabins for $30/ea which also included a shuttle ride there and back (much better than the $75 hotel room and $20 shuttle). While at the top of Blood Mt we had talked to Matt^2, who were in the same position as we were, so we requested the cabin take all 4 of us, which they agreed to. After our lodging was taken care of, Lookout and I both ate a whole pizza and talked with a SOBO who we expect to see again somewhere in NJ in a couple months. Matt^2 arrived shortly after, having abandoned lunch when the thunder started, and followed us down the mountain. We ended up waiting for our shuttle ride for about an hour, but got to watch an older thru hiker buy an entirely new set of gear, a girl who had a pack larger than she get a shakedown, and get heckled (friendily) by an older gentleman for doing long days at the start of the trail (he's probably right... But we had a plan).We caught our shuttle to Misty Mt, and met McKaine, another thru hiker who would be sharing the cabin with Lookout, Matt^2, and I for the night. We all took hot showers and laid our gear out to dry. My gear was only slightly damp where water had likely run down the back of my rain jacket, which is pretty awesome considering the rain we hiked through, but my clothes were completely soaked so I took the opportunity to do sink laundry (they couldn't have gotten any wetter anyway).We're currently chilling in the cabin... Matt^2 got a mail drop at Neels and their friends sent them 35lbs of food, including a 12 beers, 12 freeze dried dinners, and had used candy and granola bars as a packing material. They offered us what they couldn't carry, so I picked up some snacks and will grab another day of food at Neels to get me to Hiawasse. McKaine had also picked up a 6 pack and had some pizza delivered, so we're in the unfortunate situation of having far too much beer to drink tonight. It also appears that we're having s competition for who can move the least this afternoon. Life is tough.This was the best Monday (and the best day backpacking) I've had in a loooong time.","Gooch Gap
",Neels Gap,"Apr 03, Mon",14.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558824,"We slept in to varying degrees of success, waking up with the sun and rolling over/browsing the internet on phones until ~8am before we got up and started packing for our 930am shuttle. The beds were super comfortable and I slept great last night. Outside, the sun was shining and the temperature was perfect for hiking, so we were eager to get moving.Overnight, the bathroom transformed into the world worst smelling sauna, but did successfully dry all of our shoes. Also, it turns out that we had started with 24 beers, not 18 like I had said last entry, and we finished all but 6 amongst the 5 of us. We packed the rest of the beer, the extra food, and all of our stuff into the shuttle and were deposited right where we had left off the day before at Neels Gap.We all did a quick resupply, and I picked up a day of food so that I had enough to get to Hiawasse, some sunscreen, and a hat to block the sun. The folks at Neels took a picture of us and a couple other hikers for their Instagram, and we were off, headed uphill out of Neels Gap in the 60deg temperature and in the beautiful sun at ~1030am. For the first couple days off hiking I had a tendon on the top of my foot which had gotten a bit sore, but the afternoon of rest had gotten rid of that thankfully. We stopped for lunch atop an eastward vista, and admired the landscape of interlocking ridges and hills sprawled before us. Georgia is without a doubt the most beautiful state we've hiked through so far on the AT.We decended into another gap and came across TRAIL MAGIC!!! One Way Ministries had a table with snacks, water, a first aid kit, and an assortment of gear available. King Tut, the man running the event, showed the ~20 NOBOs enjoying the treats pictures of the snow in this spot a couple weeks earlier and encouraged us to stop by their events at trail days, where they provide a dinner to the first 600 hikers, showers, sewing and gear repair, barber services and sponsor doctors and vets to assist hikers if they need it and an eating contest (with hotdog and cake divisions). Lookout and I didn't stay long, enough to refill our water and have a few snacks, before tackling a short but steep 800ft ascent. At the peak we made arrangements for our first zero by reserving spots at a hostel for Thursday and Friday nights, to avoid the snow we're supposed to get Friday. We'll also head into Hiawasse to resupply for the next couple days until Franklin, NC, and the day of rest will be good to allow our bodies to recouperate from the first week of hiking (though we both feel good right now).Those plans made, we continued on. We found a sign for a shelter 1.2 miles away (shelters are typically very close to the trail) that was blue blazed (which means it's a side trail) and were momentarily confused, unable to comprehend a shelter so far off trail. That straightened out, we decended the other side of the hill, refilled our water, and came across TRAIL MAGIC. Georgia Adventure, one of the guys who organized the second trail magic I got on the first day, was offering water to passing hikers since the spring (that we had just filled up at) wasn't flowing very well. Having already filled, we topped off and continued on, spending a pleasant afternoon traversing some rolling hills.We arrived at Low Gap Shelter to find 20-30 people setting up their shelters and hanging out, so we only spent a few moments there to grab a snack before heading back out to try to beat them to a campsite which listed only one tent space (we figured we could fit 2). We hiked for a bit with Disciple, a legally blind thru hiker, before reaching Poplar Stamp Gap, our destination for the night. At ~5pm we setup camp with a German couple who was already there and began to make dinner as another couple hikers arrived. And another. And more. In addition to Matt^2 and McKaine showing up, basically everyone we had met hanging out at low gap decided to camp here, ~20 people. Somehow they all fit their shelters... welcome to camping in the bubble. We all ate dinner and conversated for a couple hours as the sun set behind the mountains to the west. Lookout and I had finished dinner and hung our bear bag fairly early, and got to watch the rest attempt (and finally succeed) to find suitable branches for hanging in a forest with 100ft trees with no low limbs. They managed to hang bear bags completely encircling our little tent city, which I'm sure is the recommended strategy.Lookout and I are planning another early start tomorrow to try to beat some rain 13 miles to a shelter. With the multitude of weather forecasts that everyone at camp pulled down, we're very certain that rain will fall from the sky at some point tomorrow, but have widely differing estimates of when it will start, so we'll see how it goes.Trail Joke: I gotta stop and fix my sock, I'm getting a hot spot. WiFi? Out here???","Neels Gap
",Poplar Stamp Gap,"Apr 04, Tue",12.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558898,"EVERYONE woke up and started getting ready at 530... granted, Lookout and I were also planning an early start, but I laid in bed until exactly 6, mostly out of stubbornness. Even so, Lookout and I were the second ones out of camp at 630.We didn't hike long with headlamps, within minutes the predawn light was enough to distinguish the trail and it soon blossomed into a beautiful sunrise. Light oranges sillouetted the clouds on the horizon and the world was painted in pastel, purples and blues for the hills and yellows and oranges for the sky.We hiked quickly, cruising by many tents, their occupants yet to rise. The colors of the sunrise continued for almost 2 hours until we reached the next shelter and the first rumble of thunder rolled through the hills and a light rain began to fall. We passed the shelter, people emerging from the tents in response to their thunderous alarm and continued moving as the storm rolled in. We crested a series of rolling hills, passing several hikers, as the lightning and thunder drew closer and thankfully began to descend into unicoi gap and away from the storm. Upon reaching the bottom we took shelter under a sign for a few minutes to rest and chat with the other hikers who were heading into town before continuing uphill.As if tied to our elevation, the storm once again rolled in as we ascended but the heavy rain provided much appreciated cooling on the uphill. As with all things that go up, we came back down into a gap and found some TRAIL MAGIC in the form of a gallon of fresh water. We began our final hill for the day up Tray Mt, the storm crescendoing once again as we crested and quickly descended from the peak towards the shelter amid the flashes of lightning and cracks of thunder.We finally arrived at the shelter to find it ""full"" of hikers, some who had neroed and some who had zeroed at the shelter. Though the shelters listed capacity was 7, it's hard to leave a hiker out in the rain, so they managed to fit us (and a few more hikers who showed up) for a total of 11 people, including a hammock suspended from the rafters.We hung out all afternoon, played spoons (with sunflower seeds) and euler with the survival cards that Ashley had given me, and watched the rain. Several more storms rolled through, including several ""shelter shakers"", but they were much more enjoyable when viewed from inside a shelter rather than while hiking. A couple hikers left in between storms, making a bit more room in the shelter, until more showed up and now we're all pretty cozy in here for the night. It's supposed to get pretty cold overnight, so we'll probably get up pretty early and get to the hostel. We'll be taking a zero in Hiawasse on Friday to rest and resupply before heading to the NC border and to Franklin.FYI: there is a guestbook (link on the left) if you feel like leaving messages/questions/etc. There's not a mechanism for me to respond directly, but I'll try to say something in the posts. Thanks to Sharon for the encouragement. Look forward to being back up in DCULs territory! PS: It's only 8pm and I can definitively verify that Lookout snores... loudly...","Poplar Stamp Gap
",Tray Mt Shelter,"Apr 05, Wed",14
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559051,"Snow?!? Snow!?! We'll get to that part...We were quite cozy last night... Overnight the temperature dropped (31F when we woke up), but having so many people in the shelter we were so close together with kept us nice and warm. I woke up a couple times to unusually loud rain, and as others emerged from the shelter in the morning, I, from the safety of my sleeping bag, learned that that was actually sleet. It took ~10 minutes to muster the will to leave the warmth of the bag and start packing up. I left the least pleasant process for last... Doning wet 30deg clothes is not something I'd wish on anyone...We left camp (the highest we had yet camped at 4200ft) at 730am, moving quickly to try to warm our clothes and using our cold weather gear (hats/gloves) for the first time. The miles came quickly as we descended Tray Mt and onto a series of ridges which afforded easy hiking. We had a good view of the surrounding terrain, bright and clearing to the east and still pretty gray to the west. The west eventually won out as the mountains around us quickly disappeared into a white veil and the precipitation started. Blown in on a gust of wind, sleet began to pepper us and the trail, sounding like a bunch of rainsticks as the ice pellets hit the dead leaves on the ground around us. Mixed with the sleet were a few snowflakes, and the two forms of precipitation competing against each other for dominance as we hiked but neither managing to accumulate in the ground.Our only major challenge for the day was Kelley Knob, which brought us back up at 4100ft (our last time that high in Georgia), and we felt the full force of the wind which made the sleet feel more like it was sandblasting us. Even the warmth generated from climbing the knob wasn't quite enough to combat the 30deg temperatures combined with the 20+mph winds, and both of us had to bundle up.Snow had actually started to accumulate at the top of Kelly and the flora at the peak far been covered in a layer of freezing rain sometime earlier and still bore the ice. We stopped for a quick snack break after cresting the ridge and traversing to the eastern face and out of the wind and I managed to give myself a brain freeze from drinking my water too quickly.From Kelly it was basically all downhill from there, but we did stop and take a side trail 0.2 to a vista and grab a couple pictures, since the weather had stolen our views from blood and tray mountains. The trail led down into Dick's Creek Gap where a shuttle for the Top of Georgia was waiting (purely by luck) and brought us down to the hostel at ~1130.At checkin we were given a quick tour and a pair of medical scrubs to wear while our clothes were wearing. The staff said that we could wear them into town... That the locals were used to it and hikers did it all the time, but I'm not sure if that's actually true or if they were just trying to make us feel better...Regardless, we grabbed quick showers, changed into our scrubs, left our clothes for laundry, and grabbed the shuttle into town. First order of business: food. We grabbed lunch at a local BBQ place before heading to the Dollar General to look for a pair of Crocs to use as camp shoes (the sandals I brought can't be worn with socks and take a minute to get on/off, both of which aren't ideal in cold and/or rain). Failing to find anything but children's sizes (which wouldn't work... We checked), we headed to the food store and picked up some fruits and veggies and a chicken to snack on back at the hostel.We caught a ride back to the hostel and spent most of the afternoon chilling... reading, listening to music, chatting, eating. It turns out that Lookout and I slightly overestimated hiker hunger at this point in the trail... we're only capable of eating 1/2 a rotisserie chicken each, so we have some left over for tomorrow. McKaine showed up here later in the afternoon and is also going to zero tomorrow to escape the cold, so we'll also be hanging out with him again. Tomorrow is a day of relaxing... We'll take the shuttle back into town in the afternoon to pick up supplies for the leg up to Franklin. We're both feeling good so we'd like to see if we can stretch our fledgling trail legs a bit do a 20mi day (without it killing us) but we're also starting to see people developing knee/foot problems, so we'll see what we decide tomorrow. Also, we heard rumor of a place that serves breakfast and dinner all day that you can get eggs, bacon, hash browns, and a burger and make it all into a giant egg burger, so we might check that out. I'm already down 3lbs from my starting body weight, which isn't going to be sustainable for the entire trail, so I'm? going to be packing more food for the trail and continuing to try to eat as many calories in town as possible. Should be a fun first zero tomorrow!","Tray Mt Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559210,"Today was our first zero of the trip, so this will likely be a shorter post about various topics.I spent the morning chilling, reading and enjoying the view from the windows and some coco. I've got ""A Walk in the Woods"" on my Kindle app, which I think I might read paced to hiking the trail. I read the first couple chapters, up until they hit Neels Gap in the book, and it was fun relating my memories of the places to how they're described in the book.Lookout grabbed a shuttle back to Neels Gap (which has the only decent outfitter in the area) to get a warmer sleeping bag to be better able to handle these (and colder) temperatures in the Smokies (which got several inches of snow yesterday).I headed into town, grabbed a less than mediocre burger (had I known I would've gone to the Mexican place), did my resupply shopping (first ever on-trail resupply), walked through the drive through ATM (couldn't find one for non-vehicular traffic), and got some takeout bbq for dinner before heading back at the hostel. At the hostel everyone was trying to convince everyone else to eat their food, since everyone bought too much and didn't want to carry it. There's so much food in the hiker box that it could easily resupply a hiker or two. I also bought more than I needed to make it the 3 days to Franklin, but it'll get eaten eventually and my pack isn't feeling very heavy right now.Had the chance to catch up with a few friends today via phone, which was nice and started planning for my maildrop in Fontana before we enter the Smokies. We're thinking we're about a week away from there, so I needed to start working out the logistics of my food and we'll need to get our permits (online) for going though the park.  Tomorrow we're planning on doing 11 miles (mostly uphill... Georgia makes you work to leave) which will take us into North Carolina and set us up for a longer day Sunday (20mi) which will put us in Franklin on Tuesday. Weather looks great all this week, so not having to plan around it will be a welcome change. Couple of random things that don't really belong anywhere else...Fun fact: Most hikers greet each other with a fist bump (but I've also been on the recieving end of an elbow tap and air-five) rather than a handshake. It's hard to tell when the last time a hiker washed their hands, used hand sanitizer, or showered, so the alternative greetings lessen the risk of spreading germs, which can be a problem in an environment like this with close quarters and dirt.Also, I've been informed (by Lookout) that I'm using the term ""nero"" incorrectly when talking about the days we reach or leave a town. A nero (near zero) refers to a low milage day, which does tend to occur when you reach/leave a town, but in our case we've been doing full miles into and out of towns, so they don't count as neros. I think the definition we settled on was any day less than 8 miles (at this point in the trip... that threshold will increase as we start doing longer days) is a nero, so in that case we haven't really taken any yet. Semantics, I know, but we have a lot of time on our hands to debate semantics while we hike.Also, just a quick clarification, I was trying to demonstrate this in the writing, but everything about this adventure this far has definitely been type 1 fun (fun to do and fun to talk about). Nothing has been type 2 (not fun to do but fun to talk about), it type 3 ( neither fun to do or talk about). The heavy rain and thunderstorm that spurred us down blood mountain and the snow we got yesterday were legitimately fun. Even hiking though the thunderstorms on Tray mountain in near freezing temperatures was at worst type 1.25 fun. Hopefully those didn't come across as complaining about the weather... this was intended to be a challenging adventure and it's doing a fine job of living up to that so far.Also, I ran into someone who's documenting their hike on YouTube. We actually met Desciple, the legally blind hiker I think I mentioned (but maybe not by name), a couple days ago coming out of Low Gap, but saw him again at the hostel as he was doing a video tour of the place. His YouTube channel is ""Not By Sight""* and so you might see a flash of me (red shirt) on the hostel tour video when he posts it and maybe some more of me if we end up in the same campsite as him in the future.* I haven't watched any of his videos and probably won't until I have better internet, so I'm just passing this info along, not necessarily endorsing/recommending his videos.","Dick's Creek Gap
",Zero day,"Apr 07, Fri",0
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559358,"We woke up this morning and the bunkroom was a flurry of activity as everyone un-exploded their packs. We grabbed the free cold breakfast at the hostel, weighed our packs (mine, disappointingly, had grown 2lbs), and then Liz, Lookout, and I (and others) loaded into the 8am shuttle back to the trailhead (a whole 0.5 miles, but it's uphill...). We pulled in to the gap and found a number of tents still setup, some of their owners just emerging for the morning. We quickly unloaded, bid our farewell to Odometer, the shuttle driver, and hit the trail. Despite the chilly morning (in the 30s), the uphill had us stripping off layers in no time, and soon we were down to our shorts and short sleeves, the jackets having been stored in the pack for the day.Lookout and I stopped in at a shelter for a water refill and snack break and it was amusing to compare us, in minimal clothing, to the recent roused hikers, bundled in puffies and jackets.We continued ascending and passed through a region which had been burned in last year's wildfires. The fire had entirely cleared the forest floor of detrius and all bushes, plants, and shrubberies, leaving only bare dirt. The bark on trunks of all the trees was deeply charred and even the taller saplings which appear to have survived weren't budding like the rest of the forest. It must've been quite a sight to see with the entire top of the mountain burning.Coming down into another small gap from the fire we came across TRAIL MAGIC in the form of a couple sodas left as the trailhead. We came across a couple hikers already enjoying the treat, and even I (who doesn't drink soda) was tempted to partake. (Side note: a coke is 140 calories (the same as a granola bar) of mostly sugar... perfect before an uphill). One of the hikers there was Collin Baggett, who is documenting his hike on Facebook and YouTube (YT channel name is Collin Baggett), so he snapped a picture of us all (I held a soda for the picture to not be awkward).Georgia sure does it's best to make sure you don't leave... The entire morning was an uphill battle and we gained over 2000 feet of elevation (not counting the PUDS, pointless ups and downs) before reaching our first big milestone of the trip, the GA/NC state line, marking the completion on 1 of the 14 states the Appalachian Trail passes through.This landmark is marked in 2 ways, by a small wooden sign affixed to a tree along the trail halfway up a never ending hill, and by a metal cylinder that used to hold a trail log now mostly consumed by the tree that it was nailed to. Had we not known to expect it and had 2 other hikers (Q2 and OnTrack) not taken lunch there, it wouldn't have been hard to miss. We snapped some pictures with the sign and decided to also eat some of our lunch there and watched as several other hikers passed through and snapped their pictures. By this time the temperature has climbed to ~60 and the sun was shining, so it was pleasant to sit for a while.Collin, the same guy from the trail magic earlier caught us once again here, and asked us to take part in his video to mark the occasion. He hired a camera guy (2 rocks) to hold his phone, and began recording by giving his viewers some corrections and notes about the previous videos (while we laughed in the background). He then mini-interviewed us about our thoughts on reaching the state line, which pretty much ranged from ""it feels like I just walked 78 miles"", to ""one down, 13 to go!"".We continued up the hill (by which I mean mountain), and came across 2 guys who informed us that there was trail magic 7 miles ahead at a gap. While we had pretty much already decided to do a couple extra miles today (we would've finished our originally planned 11mi by 1pm, and had decided that doing a 20 tomorrow for no other reason that to have done a 20 was stupid when we could easily break the 11 and 21 into a 16 and 16), the possibility of trail magic sealed the deal. We kicked on the afterburners to finish the hill and promptly found the next hill, the steepest we'd yet faced, and immediately had to slow down again. We had gotten pretty good at GA hills, but apparently still have some work to do on NC hills.We worked our way over several small (could hundred foot) but steep hills, on top of which, despite the 79deg heat, in the rhotodendron thickets, we found several inches of snow. Our climb into NC had brought us to elevations which saw significant accumulation, and there was still several inches on the ground in places as we passed through. There was very little wind, so entering the thickets felt like entering a refrigerator, the lack of sun and snow causing the temperature to drop ~30deg, which was a much appreciated way to cool off after the accents.We met up with Liz at the shelter (she had continued on at the border rather than eating lunch there), and soon reached a shelter and had second lunch with her. Lookout and I finished a little earlier than her, and eager to cover the 4 remaining miles to the gap, headed out, promising to save her some food. Those miles passed quickly and we got some great views (through the trees) on snow capped mountains to the north, which were hoping we either don't have to cross or are no longer snow capped when we get there.We finally reached the gap and found a HUGE tent setup and ~20 trucks parked all around. Signs proclaimed that we were entering the 15th annual Red Truck/Green Truck feed-a-hiker weekend, a celebration we were happy to take part in. Liz rejoined us, and we all got sausage, hotdogs, chili, pulled pork, and peach cobbler and enjoyed the feast in front of the fire and talked with our hosts for 1.5 hours. Eventually we decided that the last uphill 1 mile to camp wasn't going to climb itself, and hit the trail again, quickly reaching camp.The downside was that non of us were hungry upon reaching camp (truly a feat for a hiker), so we didn't end up eating any of our food, save for a few snacks. I started writing this journal as the sun left our camp, climbing the mountain behind our camp that we'll ascend tomorrow morning, and then staining the sky to the west with deep oranges and reds and then slowly faded to black. The moon is just about full and shining brightly even through the tent ceiling, which is unfortunately obscuring most of the stars. While writing from my tent I got to listen to MagicTouch and SmoothTalker, who decided to use the shelter tonight, realize there are mice in it (there are mice in basically every shelter) and then setup their tent IN the shelter (with some cursing), which was somewhat amusing.This will probably become more and more common, but I'm going to make a back introduction. Liz was one of the people who zeroed in the Troy Mt shelter the day with the thunder storms. She played a couple games of cards with us and chatted throughout the afternoon. She's section hiking to Damascus, and was hiking with her boyfriend up until Dick's Creek Gap, where he had to get off (he only had time for a week of hiking). She's also into swing and salsa dancing (turns out, Lookout also salsa's), which we found out when we were hanging out again at the Top of Georgia hostel. We hiked together today, are planning to tomorrow, and it looks like we might share a room in Franklin, so at least for now (and maybe for a while) she's joined us our group.Tomorrow we've got 16 miles planned, and will hopefully hit a couple good views (they're marked on the map, so they should be better than average) including a fire tower. We'll be heading into Franklin, NC on Monday where I'll be mailing myself enough supplies to get through the Smoky Mountains ahead to Fontana, NC (which has terrible resupply options) which I'll pick up in about a week. We might zero in Franklin... Franklin seems to be the least decent town for a zero for the next 150 miles, Liz was already planning to take a zero (she hasn't yet), Lookout is still trying to get his blister to heal. I don't really feel like I need one, but I'm ahead of the average schedule for a 5mo thru hike and am liking hiking with Lookout and Liz, so we'll see what I end up doing.Thru hiker logic of the day: I packed waaay too much food... What? There's trail magic in 7 miles, let's go get free food!!AppalachianTrailThruHiker.com blog, magic touch","Dick's Creek Gap
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Apr 08, Sat",16.70
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559524,"Last night we had decided to hit the trail at 8am, which meant that I could sleep in until 730. NotBad was going to hang a bear bag directly over my tent the night before, so I had volunteered to put her stuff on my bear line if she wouldn't hang her's over my tent. I had done a PCT style hang, which involves using a stick and a caribeaner to hang the the bag in the tree. I awoke just before 7 to sounds of struggling hikers... emerging from my tent I found 3 hikers standing under the bag looking up. Apparently my bear hang is also hiker proof... good to know.Before we started we also heard that the Smokies had gotten a foot of snow, so hopefully that's gone before we get there.Lookout, Liz, and I ended up hitting the trail at 830, and started with a gentle uphill all the way to the top of Standing Indian Mt. At 5400ft, it was our tallest peak so far and the highest peak we'd see for the next 100 miles. The peak had a wonderful view, the best we've had so far, with Hiawasse still in sight and mountains fading into progressively lighter shades of white in the brilliant sunshine. The peak also had a bunch of campsites, most with grass, which would've made a really nice place to sleep last night with the wind as calm as it was. From the top of the mountain we could see Albert Mountain Firetower, another good view we'd see later in the afternoon.Lookout left first to give him a lead on us since his foot was bothering him, then Liz headed out, and I stayed for a bit longer to finish posting yesterday's journal entry (no service at camp last night). After a quick snack, I headed out, and cruised most of the morning until I found them again. Lookout opted for a quick break to air out his feet, so Liz and I hiked on before stopping at a shelter for lunch. I enjoyed my first peanut butter and goldfish taco of the trip, yummmm.While we were eating Lookout leapfrogged us, and we all ended up hiking solo most of the afternoon. Most of the hiking was again through burned regions, and on one of the overlooks I could even see a plume of smoke from a distant forest. The hiking was easy and the miles passed quickly until I caught Lookout, who had found MagicTouch and SmoothTalker. I ended up taking a short nap in the shade until Liz arrived and we had no more excuse to chill.The last (and largest) hurdle of the day was yet to come, Mt Albert. While the trail wasn't too steeply inclined, it was only about 2ft wide and pearing through the dense brush to the side revealed a 100ft drop... not a good place to lose your step. After an arduous 0.5mi of steep uphill we reached the top of Albert Mt, and the fire tower. We joined a large group of hikers recuperating/enjoying the views at the base of the tower, and all grabbed some pictures from the top. We heard rumor that someone was carrying a chiuawa on the trail... HYOH I guess.From the tower we only had an easy 2.5mi to the shelter, but only 0.2mi from the tower we hit another milestone... 100miles on the AT!! That means in the past week I've made it ~1/10 of the way back to MD and ~1/22 of the way to Maine. It's hard to conceptualize those goals, so for now the plan is just to make it to Fontana and then after that the Smokies.The shelter is by far the nicest we've seen so far. Built only 5 years ago, it's dual level and has a covered area, a picnic table, a bar for cooking on, and mice hangs (to hang the packs so the the mice can't get to them). I had instant mash potatoes, goldfish (for crunch), and some red pepper flakes for dinner. The tent sites were small and situated in a steep hill, so we decided to use the shelter, Lookout, Liz, and I on the top level with Saucy, Coach, Helena, and Dylan. The bear hang was tough due to the lack of flat ground and short trees, but we managed to find a tree and get a bag up.Also, it looks like Liz picked up a trail name today. She's finished medical school and is starting her residency after her hike, and can't help but using medical terminology when talking to people (ie ""These pack straps are hurting my clavicles"", something about miniscal tears... Etc). So we've dubbed her Doc. We'll see if it sticks.We have 7 miles to the road tomorrow and a shuttle at 11am, so we'll get moving pretty quickly tomorrow morning. I need to put together some supplies to send ahead to myself tomorrow, and there's a good brewery in town for dinner, so that'll be tomorrow's plan. It's looking more and more like Lookout and Doc are going to take a zero on Tuesday, but I'm still really undecided because I don't really need another day off right now. Lookout is going to try to find a doctor to take a look at his foot tomorrow, and might take a couple days off trail to let that heal, so if that happens I will probably not take the zero since it won't allow me to keep hiking with him either way. We'll see.Couple of interesting notes... We've been moving fast enough that we're now finding some people who started a week before us, which shows the different paces that people move at.Also, I've forgotten to mention that several people have complimented my ""cool space socks"", ie, my gaiters. They've got colorful galaxies/planets on them... glad to see my trail accessorization is appreciated.","Standing Indian Shelter
",Long Branch Shelter,"Apr 09, Sun",16.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559884,"We awoke just before the sun, early enough so that we could cover the 7mi to winding stair gap before the 11am shuttle. Somehow MagicTouch and SmoothTalker had already slipped out from downstairs without waking any of us, which is fairly impressive. I grabbed a poptart for breakfast as we got moving. Liz and I quickly pulled ahead of Lookout, whose foot was still slowing him down, and eventually I pulled ahead of Liz for the easy hike down to Rock Gap. We found MagicTouch and SmoothTalker at Rock Gap waiting for a shuttle, but Liz and I elected to do the last 4 miles to winding stair gap so that we wouldn't have to double back and do that section coming out of Franklin.Despite getting to the gap 45min before the shuttle was scheduled, we somehow missed it by 10min, so we headed out to the road and stuck out a thumb. The second car to come along, a gray prius, pulled over for us and Rudy offered Liz, I, and Ty (another guy who had reached the gap at the same time as us) a ride into town. This was Liz's first time hitching, but the prius went a long way towards establishing Rudy's credibility (cause only good people drive priuses). Rudy lived not too far from the trail and had sectioned hiked from Springer to Harper's Ferry over a couple trips, so knew what he was getting into by picking up hikers (mostly in terms of smell).We got dropped off at the budget inn, where we had reserved a room, which was swarming with other hikers all arriving on various shuttles. The hotel room left a lot to be desired... Cleanliness, for one, but you get what you pay for and the room we were splitting only cost us $17/pp. After the pack-splosion and showers, we ventured out to meet everyone else, and enjoyed a beer courtesy of Chicken, one of the hikers next door, and an ice cream sandwich courtesy of Turbo, and met Roudy and Boston who they were rooming with.We spent the rest of the day on various chores... We ran up to the outfitter and I picked up some new tent stakes (which will be easier to use with my tent), a bandana (for wiping hands/sweat/etc), and some permitherin (an apply-once, couple month bug repellant for clothes/gear). While Lookout picked up a new pair of shoes, Liz and I grabbed a cider/beer in the outfitter's attached bar and planned food for the next week and the Smokies. We stopped at Ingles to food shop and then Lookout decided to take a night in while Liz and I headed down to a local brewery. Unfortunately their food truck (which is the only on-site source of food) had just closed so we got a supreme pizza delivered (because we need our veggies) to the brewery, because we're classy hikers. Because we're good friends, we brought Lookout back a couple pieces of pizza and hung out with the hikers next door again until about midnight before turning in fit the night.Tomorrow we're going to zero at Gooder hostel in town, which will hopefully be cleaner than the budget inn.","Long Branch Shelter
",Franklin,"Apr 10, Mon",7.20
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560001,"Today's a zero, so also probably a shorter entry...We grabbed breakfast at the Kountry Kitchen, a little diner/breakfast place in town. I got an omelet and a plate of french toast, which was heavenly after a couple mornings of poptarts. After breakfast we stopped by the post office to pick up a box to bounce ourselves some food to Fontana and headed back to the budget inn. Upon returning we found the parking lot SWARMING with hikers... The forest service had closed the next 6 miles of trail due to a forest fire, which meant that all the hikers were headed into town to take an enforced zero. The other alternative, skip ahead to the next part of the trail, wasn't particularly attractive to most hikers, though we planned to do it if the trail remained closed tomorrow. I met up with LogJam (formerly Matt, of Matt^2), ExtraMile (formerly GPS), Hulk, Missionary, NotBad, and several others as they tried to find rooms for the night.Our shuttle to Gooder arrived, Zen, the owner of the place, so we headed over to claim our bunks. I took the opportunity to treat my gear with permitherin (a bug repellant that you apply once every couple months but have to let dry on the gear) and then Lookout, Liz, and I headed over to the Lazy Hiker (a brewery) for a couple drinks. I had a ""Springer fever"" as well as a ""20 miler"" (loving the AT references). We moved over to Curahee brewing (where Liz and I had gone last night) and played cornhole and enjoyed the beer for the rest of the afternoon/evening with a bunch of hikers including Tang, NotKyle, and some of their Tramily (Trail Family). Lookout found a beer that, according to him ""redeemed all of Franklin"" in terms of beer quality... a Russian Imperial Stout called ""Dammit, Russia"", which tasted like a fruitcake. Liz and I won 4 games of cornhole, but eventually (finally) lost to a couple other hikers. Throughout the afternoon the smoke from the fire was visible... Making the otherwise brilliant blue and white of the sky and clouds a dark brown/orange color to the west. The hikers closed the bar down (not terribly hard when it closes at 9... It is a weeknight even if weeks don't have as much meaning as they used to) and while waiting for a ride back to the hostel from Zen, Liz and I practiced some swing, foxtrot, and waltz in the parking lot and Lookout showed us some bachata and salsa.We got back to the hostel, attempted to watch a movie but all fell asleep 20min into it and headed to bed.While I didn't necessarily originally want to take a zero, it turned out to be one of the best days ""on the trail"" so far. I've decided to take the trail closure today as a sign that today was meant to be a zero. There's a part of me that's still a little too focused on the goal and thinks I should've made some miles today, but looking back now, those miles wouldn't have been worth what would've been missed. Hopefully I'll get better at ignoring that part and just enjoy this experience as it continues.","Franklin
",Franklin,"Apr 11, Tue",0
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560138,"We all awoke pretty early, as we're now accustomed to doing, even when indoors. The trail was open! So we packed up a readied ourselves for the 9am shuttle back to the trail. Unfortunately, Lookout had decided to hang back, get the haircut he had been wanting, and take a couple shorter days to allow his foot to finish healing, so we parted ways as Liz and I boarded the shuttle. We'll definitely see him again, if only at Trail Days next month, but there's also a chance he might catch us again after he's back to 100%... only time will tell.Liz, Bear, Tropical, and I got dropped at the trail head at ~930 along with a couple others from the budget inn shuttle? (Missionary, NotBad, KickATree, GearRat, and others) and hit the trail once again. Liz opted to continue listening to her audiobooks, so I moved on ahead and ended up passing all the hikers mentioned above, leaving nothing but open trail ahead.In the first couple hundred yards of trail I passed by a couple firefighters doing some mop-up work from the fire the day before (tamping out any remaining hot spots), but though the fire had come close to the trail it had been stopped about a hundred feet from the trail at it's closest. The air had a lingering smoky smell, but the sounds of the road abruptly disappeared as I rounded a hill, leaving me back in the wilderness on this beautiful sunny morning.The trail rose steadily out of the gap and onto a series of progressively taller peaks, but the incline was less tiring that normal... perhaps just because it was good to be moving again. Eventually the trail opened up into a clearing which contained a blue blazed trail which led to the summit of Siler Bald, 0.2mi away and uphill. Normally I might've skipped it, but since I was already ahead of everyone and it was about lunch time, I opted to take it and hiked up the steeply inclined meadow to the summit of the bald. The summit was marked by a pink granite plack proclaiming the name of the mountain and it's height (5,216ft), and from the top I could see Franklin (which I had just left), the Albert Mt Firetower (which we had passed a couple days earlier, now just a spec on the summit of the distant mountain), and the Nantahala River (which we'd reach in 2 days) in the panoramic view. It seems like I say this a lot, but this was the best view of the trip so far. It would be nice if sometime could make an Augmented Reality app which could add labels to mountains viewed by the phone's camera, because although the view was stunning it was hard to identify all but the most obvious landmarks.Anyways, I descended back to the AT and came across Liz, who had stopped for lunch just a few yards down from the summit trail, so I stopped and chatted for a bit. We agreed to meet at the top of Wayah Bald, our peak for the afternoon, so I kept cruising solo for the afternoon. The trail descended into a gap with a road (where we would've had to start had the trail still been closed), before climbing a long and tough incline which lasted a couple miles. Nearing the top I ran into a couple hikers heading down who informed me that there was trail magic at the summit.There's nothing quite like a bit of magic to make a hill feel not as steep, and it didn't take long to reach the summit. The TRAIL MAGIC consisted of a cooler of drinks, a cooler of fresh fruit, and a ton of snacks and candy, a much appreciated gift. The guy providing the gift hadn't had many hikers through today, because of the fires, which meant there was plenty to go around as hikers started trickling in.   When asked for why he liked to provide the magic, he responded in his usual (somewhat gruff) manner with ""if you're dumb enough to walk to Maine, someone otta reward you for it"".While enjoying the treats I met Fireproof, a guy from Maine (from the town next to where I went to high school), learned that the trail had been reclosed for at least a little while at 1045 this morning, which meant we were extremely lucky in when we started to have made it, and learned that skateboard guy (who I saw my first day on trail) was still hiking a few days behind.For whatever reason, either the time of year or the fact that this area had burned last fall, there were a ton of tiny gnats flying around and so we decided to move on. We visited the stove observation tower, also crisped by the fires, before continuing to the shelter, which was only a mile away. We opted to sleep inside tonight because of a chance of rain (packing up wet gear isn't very fun, so might as well avoid it if possible). Sure enough, 5min after reaching the shelter a quick shower passed through as we unpacked. Logjam showed up and also Twisted, an older gentleman from midcoast Maine.As we were cooking dinner we were treated to a couple rainbows as a shower passed through the valley below and caught the last rays of sun of the day. We headed to bed, as the sun set, shading the clear sky above our heads with a perfect gradient of orange to blue. I got up a little later and was treated to a rare sight... A light shower was passing through by the shelter but the stars were still brightly visible in the night sky above as were the lights of a town in the valley below, including it's blinking stoplights.","Franklin
",Wayah Bald Shelter,"Apr 12, Wed",11
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560139,"We woke in the morning to a blood red sunset, illuminating the spotless sky and thick fog which filled the valleys like water which left mountain islands poking up through. Liz and I left the shelter last, but it wasn't long before we started seeing/passing our last night's companions. We stopped several times throughout the morning for a couple overlooks, which seem to be becoming more prevalent. We opted to take a 0.1mi side trail up the steep face of rocky knob after which we rested for a bit, had a snack, enjoyed the view of the last of the fog dissapating, and I taped one of my toes to prevent a blister. We crossed a gap and met a day hiker who jokingly warned us the Maine isn't all it's cracked up to be... a claim which I was well equipped to refute, to his amusement (since the 2 other Mainiacs ahead of me had had similar reactions). We continued the ascent to the peak of Wesser Bald, since we wanted to have lunch on the fire tower at the summit. Though the trail was fairly steep, my legs actually didn't tire, which is a nice improvement over the start of the trail. The panoramic views from the tower were spectacular and we could trace the peaks had crossed over the previous 2 days, could see the Nantahala river clearly in the valley below, and could most likely see the Smokies to the north (though we couldn't pick them out specifically). We took a quick lunch but were soon driven away once again by the small gnats. While we had originally planned on camping at the shelter 1mi before the Nantahala Outdoor Center and passing through in the morning, we heard there was camping available at NOC (seperately from the cabins, which we didn't want to stay in since we had just been in Franklin) and so we decided to push on so that we could get a burger and beer for dinner tonight. The trail quickly turned very steep and rocky and in combination with the particularly burnt trees that decorated the ridge we felt like we were hiking through Mordor, a feeling we've had throughout NC with all the burnt sections we've seen. The full decent for the afternoon totaled 2500ft, which our knees began to feel as we continued downwards. We passed Bear (also known as The Chairman because of the camp chair he carries) having lunch, Tropical, and Fireproof as we hiked. We also passed a unique group of male hikers, 2 of which were hiking shirtless and one who was only wearing a backpack and a small plaid loincloth, a sort of tiny kilt???? We didn't linger near them and soon enough reached NOC, where I had stopped on the road trip down to Springer almost 2 weeks ago. We grabbed a burger and beer at Rivers End restaurant with LogJam and Cole and some refreshments at the general store and headed over to the camping area and got some TRAIL MAGIC in the form of an orange from an off duty ranger in return for our opinions on this section of trail. We reported a couple of downed trees on the trail and some garbage that was left at a shelter a couple days ago, and then continued on to claim our spot in tent city with all the other hikers who didn't want to get cabin.After establishing camp we headed back to NOC and sat by the river with a bunch of other hikers and enjoyed the warm afternoon sun and the freezing river water on our feet with our drinks. We got some more TRAIL MAGIC from a young couple who traded the last couple slices of their pizza for a chat about the trail and our experience thus far. As the sun set we headed back to camp and joined the PA4 (also known as the PennMen) at their fire with the other tent city hikers. As we chatted the stars came out and a couple of early fireflies began their dance.Liz and I (and several others) had setup our tents on the other side, so we headed back there and took the opportunity to enjoy the stars (we even saw 4 satellites) and the sounds of the river before heading to bed.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560140,"I woke with the sun, as usual but rolled over a couple times until I heard Liz get up and head to the bathroom. I emerged from my tent and sat watching the river for a few minutes until she returned. The water had dropped a couple inches overnight due to the dam that NOC used to control the river level for rafting and water sports. After a quick fix inventory so that we could resupply, Liz and I headed back to Rivers End for breakfast. We both got a Fontana Hashbrown: potatoes, broccoli, peppers, onions, and sausage served with 2 eggs and cheese on top, and some french toast. We hung out there eating, chatting, and charging our phones for an hour and a half.We made a quick stop at the general store for a resupply... I picked up another days worth of food to ensure that I had enough to get to Fontana, and then headed over to the outfitter's. I bought a cheap headlamp to serve as a short term replacement to my current headlamp, which won't hold a charge, until I can get a new one. I also printed my permit to hike through Smoky Mountain National Park, and Liz caught up on some work she had to take care of.Afterwards, we headed back to camp and packed up. The heat of the day had really taken hold, and we were sweating just packing our bags. We headed back to NOC, dipped our feet in the water for a bit, and then headed out. The trail from NOC rises continuously for 2500ft over 5 miles, and so we began our slow upward slog, cresting false summit after false summit. We stopped occasionally to refill water, have a snack, or tape feet to prevent blisters and thankfully some clouds rolled in and blocked the sun which made the hike a bit easier.While hiking we watched a C-130 weave through the Nantahala valley twice at an altitude lower than we were, presumably training pilots for low flying in mountainous terrain. We also noted that this was the 3rd Sassafras Mt we had climbed on the trail and each had seemed harder than the last... a trend we hope doesn't continue.Throughout the afternoon we had watched rain showers to the south and sunny skies to the north, but as we summited the rain seemed to start moving in so we raced it down to the shelter. Though the skies threatened, the rain never arrived, but we elected to sleep in the shelter anyways. We met Missionary, Lipstick, and several others at the shelter, and cooked and ate dinner. One of the guys at the shelter is a yoga instructor and so offered to do a yoga class, which Liz and I, in addition to a number of other hikers took him up on. I've never attempted to do yoga on a 45deg slope before, and it certainly made it a bit more difficult, but I don't think I've ever felt so good heading to bed after a day of hiking.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560511,"Though I went to bed feeling great, one session of yoga can only do so much to make up for days of hiking, so I woke up just about as sore as usual. We did have the loudest snorer I've ever heard in the shelter last night... Liz diagnosed him with distruptive sleep apnea on the spot, but it basically meant that it sounded like Godzilla was sleeping in the shelter. All in all, I can't legitimately complain since I chose to sleep in the shelter, so food for thought in the future.I finished packing a few minutes before Liz and so headed out before her in order to climb the 1.2mi to the first summit to get some cell signal to post a journal entry. The climb didn't take long and wasn't steep except for the last section, and soon I was standing atop Cheoah Bald and admiring the views to the north and west. I definitely want to camp on a bald at some point soon to get the great sunset, sunrise, and stars from the top but won't get to until after the Smokies (which has restrictions on where camping is allowed).Liz arrived a couple minutes after I finished posting, and so we headed out. We chatted all morning which made the miles pass quickly, the conversation flowing for hours through a myriad of topics.Soon enough we could see and hear Stechoah Gap and as we completed the decent we caught sight of a bunch of hikers gathered around a very full picnic table. Could it be???? Yessss!!! TRAIL MAGIC!! We dropped our packs and dug into the apples, bananas, crackers, and Gatorade that had been left for us when the trail angle himself, Quest, pulled up in his truck with more bananas. Quest had hiked in 2004 and was giving back to the trail as he had been given to during his hike. As the hikers went around and introduced ourselves it turns out that Quest has been seeing my posts on trailjournals. Shoutout to Quest for awesome trail magic!I honestly didn't think that anyone other than those I had sent the link to were reading, so that was a big surprise. Remember to sign the guestbook!Liz and I reluctantly turned down his offer for a shuttle into Robbinsville for the all-you-can-eat pizza buffet, since we had just been at NOC the day before, but several hikers did take him up on his offer as we hit the trail again.The next section of trail was named ""Jacobs Ladder"", which I was hoping indicated the presence of ladder rungs driven into the rock or at least a steep rocky accent that required scrambling. It turns out that its just a steep portion of trail and was unremarkable enough that we missed the turnoff to the cliffs right after it, which is where we had planned to lunch. Instead we headed down to the shelter, refilled on water, enjoyed lunch (I tried spam for the first time, solid eh), and ate the survived-jacobs-ladder fruit snacks I had been saving for the top (which we hadn't eaten since we hadn't noticed the ladder at all).We again hit the trail and chatted the afternoon away (and by that I mean that Liz did most of the talking, which is fine by me). We saw two ~5ft rat snakes along the trail (which slithered away harmlessly... they're not poisonous) right before we pulled into Cable Gap Shelter. Our plan was to eat dinner here before doing a couple more miles in the evening/night to put us in a good position to reach Fontana early and get breakfast. After finishing dinner (mashed potatoes with chicken, goldfish, and Ritz with a dessert of Snickers) we hung around and rested. Just before we were about to leave a man came into camp with the funniest looking pack I had ever seen... he was carrying a large red box that looked sorta like the kind pizza delivery drivers use to keep pizza warm and his backpack was very square and almost looked like a cooler. He entered camp and dropped his bags in the shelter and started asking if we had seen someone named Mustardseed, who had apparently, somehow, without cell signal at the shelter, ordered pizza. Unable to find Mustardseed and unwilling to carry the pizzas back down the mile of trail he had carried them up from the road, he told us that we would have to dispose of them, as well as the sodas and beers in his backpack and the cookies he had brought. TRAIL MAGIC!!!!Ok, so the name of this over-dedicated delivery guy is actually Mustardseed and he lives locally and does this magic every so often. He thru hiked last year to raise money for a couple of charaties and does this trail magic as outreach to raise awareness about the organizations with hikers in the hopes that they'll help him raise money. He's currently raising money for Friends of Barnabus (fobf.org, usual disclaimer: I haven't visited their site or looked at their content, just passing on what I was told).After Liz and I finished our second dinner we hit the trail again, taking our time on the last 3 miles for the day. As we crested the ridge we caught our first sight of Fontana lake, a massive lake that fills the contours of the valley it occupies, held in place by the massive Fontana dam at it's western end. I've seen the dam in a lot of YouTube videos of thru hikes, since it's a popular landmark, but they fail to capture it's size (which I'm sure will be even more evident when we cross it tomorrow morning). We continued moving as the sun sank towards the horizon and before we knew it came to a small gap with 2 tent sites, our home for the night. We dropped our packs and raced up a side trail to catch the sunset, and though part of it was blocked by an inconveniently placed hill, Liz and I watched as the sun's orange color spilled into the sky, fading to peach and purple in the clouds and mountains around it as the sun sank below the horizon. Only after the vibrant colors began to fade did we head back to our bags and setup our shelters, change into camp clothes, and hang our bear bag. After finishing we took a moment to appreciate the stars above before retreating to our tents. This is both of our first times camping in as small a group (2), which although largely the same as what we're accustomed to, has a different feeling than camping at a shelter with ~20 others around. We'll see how it goes.Liz has blisters on her heels... I'm hoping that doesn't prevent her from hiking like it did with Lookout. She's a trained medical professional, but unfortunately there's not a ton that can be done for blisters medically, so we'll have to see how they affect her. Though we'll definitely be splitting up when her mom joins her after the Smokies, it would be nice to not have to split earlier due to injury.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560631,"We had decided to get up early to make it to Fontana Lodge before their restaurant closed at 11 for Easter brunch, so we hit the trail at 630 in the predawn light. We passed a couple tents, their occupants still slumbering, and watched as the sun rose over mountains of clouds which dotted the eastern sky. Our hike this morning was a short jaunt down the ridge and to the dam, which was still lit up below us. The trail wove through several patches of mountain flowers in bloom, their white, yellow, maroon, and camo colored petals brightening up the hillside which was a pleasant green, all and all much better scenery than the charred hillsides of Mordor.... I mean southern NC. We took the miles slowly because the downhill aggravated the blisters on Liz's heels, but still arrived at the road by 8am. Though we could've gotten a shuttle from there, we elected to hike to the shelter, the ""Fontana Hilton"", another 1.1mi, so that we wouldn't have to backtrack and hike this section later. We pulled into the Hilton, so named because of the amenities it offers hikers including hot showers, a solar charging station for electronics, a firepit and seating, a spicot of potable water, flush toilets, and space to accommodate at least 20 hikers in the shelter. We immediately availed ourselves of the showers, a glorious feeling after 4 days of hiking in the sun, and then collected our laundry to do at the lodge.We called for a shuttle and headed up to the lodge, heading for the restaurant first. Though we did make it in time for breakfast, after comparing the breakfast and Easter brunch menus, we opted to go with the brunch, which although a bit pricier, was all-you-can-eat. In the meantime until the brunch started we headed down to the general store and did our laundry with a number of other hikers, most of whom were wearing their rain gear (which is the only thing that doesn't usually need to be washed). I treated myself to a banana and chocolate milk from the store, two things you don't usually find on trail, while our laundry ran, and then we headed up to the lodge again for brunch.We had asked and there was no dress code for the brunch (although it looked like all the hikers were put in a separate room), so we could attend in what we were wearing, which for me was running shorts and a black long john top, and for Liz was her black town dress. We devoured the brunch, starting with a salad and broccoli cheddar soup, moving on to roasted chicken, pineapple ham, mashed potatoes, grilled cheese, green beans, corn casserole, and beef brisket, and finishing with a mini strawberry cheesecake and a mini coconut macaroon cake. Soooo good.We rolled ourselves out of the restaurant and successfully retrieved our food packages, but I hadn't received either of the letters I was expecting. The post office didn't open until 1145am Monday, so with nothing to do about the letters we headed back to the shelter. By the time we got back most of our pocket of hikers had arrived and were setting up camp. I took the opportunity to open my boxes and sort my food. The bulk of my food was as expected, since I had mailed it to myself, but the support box contained a number of goodies from friends.I got a small bottle of Makers Mark whiskey, a couple of hard apple ciders, an easter egg filled with candy, several letters from friends, a chocolate rabbit, some blueberry bread, some trader joe's trail mix cookies, and some home baked cookies. I didn't want to pack most of this out, so it all had to be eaten! Liz graciously offered to help with the food and drink, but it was still going to be a challenge to finish.I took a break from sorting to take a dip in the lake in the rain with Fireproof, Left foot, and a couple others while Liz took pictures because she ""couldn't swim in her dress"". Laaame.After the dip and back to the eating food... thankfully, an old friend (well... as old as they get at this point on the trail) chose that moment to show up... Lookout! He had taken an extra day in Franklin and was back to full health and had been doing a couple of longer days to catch up. Our little tramily hung out throughout the evening and caught up on the happenings on the trail. A couple of hikers got a shuttle to bring them to town, pickup pizza, and bring it back, since there weren't any delivery places open.","Walker Gap
",Fontana Hilton,"Apr 16, Sun",3.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560652,"The day started early as usual, I sat out and enjoyed the sunrise over the lake and a couple of loons were chatting with each other throughout the morning.Lookout packed up quickly and headed out after we had agreed on a shelter to meet at for the night. I had to hang out until the post office opened at 1145 and Liz had some work she had to take care of on a computer, so we planned to head up to the lodge via the shuttle.
While we waited for the shuttle service to start at 830, Liz and I did a pack shakedown to try to cut what she's carrying to the bare essentials since her pack is pretty heavy for her. Liz also took a look at a guy's arm who had severely sprained/broken his wrist yesterday playing frisbee and fashioned him a sling out of bandanas to support it until he could get to a doctor in town.
Once we got up to the lodge I got a breakfast burrito from the restaurant and then took a nap while my phone and battery charged, since I had nothing else I needed to do. Eventually the post office opened and I got one of my letters and sent some gear home (my alcohol stove which I had replaced with my canister stove from home, my old tent stakes which I had replaced with easier-to-use ones in Franklin) and Liz sent her unneeded gear home. One of my letters didn't arrive in time, which is unfortunate but not the end of the world... I just had it returned to sender and will take care of it later.
Liz and I got the shuttle back to the shelter and hit the trail again. We stopped for a while at the dam visitors center and viewed the exhibits on how the dam had been built and how it affects the local area and people. We also got some TRAIL MAGIC from the visitor center staff who gave us some crackers they keep for hikers. We started our crossing of the dam at ~2 under the sunny skies and stopped often along it's ~1/2mi length to admire it's size and the lake it held at bay.
Partway across we ran into MasterSplinter, a Smokies ridgerunner who reminded us about the basic bear safety tips we had already read as part of the permit process, let us know that most of the inconsistent springs in the mountains were running because of the recent rain, and that we were thru hikers 55 and 56 to enter the park today. Just as a point of reference, I was the ~80th thru hiker to start at Springer on the day I started (at 2pm), so naively assuming that those numbers are directly comparable, the numbers have started to dwindle a bit (~30% have dropped out) but there's still a ton of people out here.
Liz and I dropped our permits in the hiker box which marked our entry into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and immediately started the first part of our ~3000ft ascent that would bring us up into the mountains. The sun was brutal as we climbed and it wasn't long before we were back to feeling like we hadn't showered in days. Thankfully (or not) clouds began to roll in and as we traversed a narrow ledge that offered a view we could see rain falling from the clouds not far from us and heading our way. 
There's nothing like impending rain to provide motivation and so we hustled up the next mountain in hopes of reaching the peak, and the firetower it was home to, before the rain set in. We made it 0.1mi from the summit before the first wave of thunder rocked the sky, making it too dangerous to go climb the giant lightning rod in hopes of a view (the only clear view we would've gotten of Fontana lake and dam). We quickly switched to rain mode... doning pack covers and rain jackets and once again, in an all too common occurrence, began running down a mountain from a thunderstorm. We moved quickly, putting distance between ourselves and the storm but could still hear the rumbling throughout the afternoon. The rain followed us and sporadically re-wet us before finally drenching is just before we reached camp.
Not far from camp we startled a herd of wild boar who had bedded down under some rhotodendrons near the trail to escape the rain and sent the 15 or so black boars scampering off into the forest. Though we got thouroghly soaked by rain on the last climb into camp, the rain subsided for a few minutes as we arrived which allowed us to quickly setup our tents (the shelter had long since filled and there were ~15 tents dotted the area around), get our stuff inside, change into dry clothes, and head over to the designated cooking area under shelter pavilion to make dinner.
I had Mac and cheese with ramen noodles and freeze dried chicken in a tortilla (gotta change it up every once in a while) and finished with a dessert of a KitKat and a freeze dried dark chocolate cheesecake mix (that I had bought years ago and never used as so had sent to me in my resupply to get rid of).
After hanging my food and odorous items on the bear line I headed to bed after a long day. The rain came and went throughout the night but I stayed warm and dry in my tent.","Fontana Hilton

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561076,"The rain came and went multiple times during the night, but all and all it was a very cozy night. Thankfully the rain stopped before we got up, which allowed us some time to get packed up and on the trail in relative dryness. We had elected to leave fairly early to try to beat everyone to a shelter 17mi distant so that we'd be dry tonight?. The first few miles were pleasant and the trail sloped up and down in a few places. The footing on the downhills was solid and our trained legs carried us up the small hills with ease, so neither slowed us down.Of course, the rain soon caught up with us and continued pretty regularly throughout the morning. As we started in the morning we were able to see the fog clinging to the valleys below us, but that disappeared as we hiked further up into the mountains and soon all the scenery was swallowed by the mists. We crossed the tops of several mountains and marveled at the panoramic views of the fog before reaching a shelter, the only dry spot for miles in which we could have lunch.When we arrived the sole occupant already had a small fire going (the shelters are stone and have fireplaces in the Smokies) which provided a little warmth as we hung our outerwear up to dry for a few min. He was a bit odd... according to him he was supposed to meet his buddy for a backpacking trip but that friend had gotten called away for work suddenly and had left with this guy's gear and food. Despite the infeasibilty if his story, after we had eaten we gave him a bit of our unneeded food (hey, lighter pack for us to carry), re-doned our rain gear, and headed back out.Though we had hiked together in the morning, Lookout and I split off from Liz (who is still feeling her blisters a bit) for the afternoon. Just a few minutes into hiking he and I had removed the rain gear, which is mainly for warmth rather than protection from the wet... You can either be wet from the inside (sweat) or the outside (rain) and he and I both side on other outside wet being more pleasant. Thankfully the rain stopped and we cruised the next 6mi to the shelter at a pace of ~3.4mph, driven by our desire to not have to camp out in the rain again tonight (and a desire to test our max pace). That pace was about the fastest that we could safely manage given the muddy trail, but it got us to the shelter before the rain restarted again and we arrived as the 2nd and 3rd occupants for the night, which we were surprised at (we figured more people would've stopped early because of the rain). Arriving so early all but ensured our spot for the night (since section hikers/general backpackers have priority for shelter space in the Smokies and can kick thru hikers out of a shelter, last in, first out). We changed into our dry camp clothes and claimed our spot in the shelter as more people trickled in and eventually filled the shelter over the next hour.We hung out for the afternoon, ate dinner, and started making plans for our nero into Gatlinburg and zero in Asheville the next days. As the shelter occupants were bedding down for the night a couple of the tenters (for some reason) came in and decided to make a fire in the shelter fireplace. After a couple unsuccessful attempts they resorted to dumping liquid stove fuel on it, which while effective, created an unnervingly large fireball. The fire didn't last long since none of the shelter occupants were really interested in 1) the fire, 2) going outside in the chilly wind and mist to collect wood, which was just as well for us.Anyways, a couple of milestones to point out... This is officially (by duration) the longest backpacking trip I've been on (previous was 17 days on the Long Trail). Also, this shelter sits on the TN/NC border, which we've being hiking along for the past day or so, which is the 3rd state I've hiked in on the AT so far (we hike the border for another ~190mi, so still a little while before we can celebrate another state down).","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561448,"There's nothing quite like waking up to driving rain and cloudy mists whipping by in a shelter with 17 of your closest friends... especially when the shelter is designed to hold 12 people (but there's always more space in a shelter when it's raining out). We woke up early but ended up getting up pretty late since none of us wanted to move. We hadn't intended it this way, but it ended up that Liz slept the closest to the door and had placed her bear spray at her head... Ready to defend the entire shelter against any ursal intrusions.We eventually got moving, intending to do 12mi to get to Newfound Gap where we could get a ride into Gatlinburg where we could rent a car to drive to Asheville for our zero. We finally got moving and found ourselves hiking across some pretty narrow and rocky ridges, still surrounded in fog. We reached the next shelter and kept hiking, plunging into a dense coniferous forest where moss blanketed every downed tree and limb on the forest floor. As we continued to ascend the trail thankfully became rockier (probably the only time I'll say that) which made the mud less cumbersome to avoid. These factors made the trail started to feel much more northern, like what I had encountered on the Long Trail in northern Vermont, which was a nice change of scenery.We eventually emerged from the forest and onto more rocky ridges as we neared the summit, while clouds blew across the ridge in front of us. The trail eventually dumped out onto a paved path which we followed for just a little bit to the summit. The summit of Clingman's Dome (the highest point on the AT at 6640ft) is topped with a concrete observation tower which has a long spiral ramp leading to the top. We headed up to the top and took in the scenery we had worked so hard to enjoy... actually we just took a couple of pictures with the mist and joked about the fact that we hadn't seen ANY part of the Smokies yet. A couple minutes later we were joined by some day hikers who were estatic that they had ""conquered"" the mountain (after they had driven up the first 6340ft and walked up the 0.5mi paved path which covers the last 300ft of elevation. To each their own... we also felt good about our ""conquest"" for the day and so followed said paved path down to the visitors center. We had decided to cut our day a little short at 5mi (instead of the original 12mi) to take advantage of a free shuttle down from the visitors center to Gatlinburg. By stopping here we also would have another chance at seeing view from the top when were returned to the trail on Friday, hopefully with nicer weather.We grabbed a shuttle from a local Baptist Church and as we followed the winding road down into the valley the sky cleared as the sun started shining... it was a BEAUTIFUL day everywhere but where we were hiking... figures. Damage from the fires last fall were evident on the hillsides where huge swathes of trees were blackened and burnt, but the forest here seemed to be recovering faster than other sections we had hoped through as there were hints of green on many of the trees and the forest floor.We arrived in Gatlinburg and got dropped off at the NOC outfitter where we quickly changed out of our wet clothes. I'm addition to being uncomfortable, it felt a little incongruous to be in rain jackets and wet hiking clothes in the middle of a beautiful day. Afterwards we caught a ride from the one Uber driver in town to car rental place. We ended up getting a minivan (the only other option was a Jeep) and headed back downtown to get some food at the Smoky Mountain Brewery, where Lookout and I both got a flight of beer which included every beer the brewery makes, a totally of 12, the largest flight I've ever seen. After finishing the flight, some wings, and a pizza we drove the ~90 min to Asheville, got a hotel, pack-splosioned to start drying our gear out, and showered. Feeling refreshed and dressed in our least smelly clothes, we walked downtown to a brewery called Wicked Weed (in reference to hops) where we got burgers and enjoyed some beer for a couple hours.We closed the brewery down (not hard since it closed at 10) and headed back to our hotel room where Liz and I watched Avengers: Civil War until ~2am (we had been talking about the movie a couple days ago on the trail) on her iphone before collapsing into sleep.","Siler Bald Shelter

We gathered up our laundry to do later and headed over to Sunny Point Cafe, recommended to us by the hotel staff. We had THE BEST BREAKFAST of the trail so far... We split some fried green tomatoes and I had an omelet with peppers and onions and tomatoes and bacon and chipotle aoli with chipotle cheese grits and a biscuit and a kids order of french toast (with fruit!!). We were all stuffed afterwards... great cure for hiker hunger.We headed over to Ingles, resupplied with another day of food to get us out of the Smokies, popped into the adjacent laudrymat (my turn for rain jacket laundry), headed over to REI to do some gear changes (I got a drybag for my sleeping bag since it had gotten damp a couple times on rainy days, a small drybag to replace the Ziploc holding my AWOLs guide, a small mesh sack to replace the one I was using for my bear throw, and a can of fuel for my stove). While shopping we got called out as Thru hikers after an employee caught Lookout and I comparing sock tans and got talking about the trail. This REI had done some trail maintenance and had removed 20trees from the trail recently, so props to them!We headed back to the hotel to drop everything off and were assaulted by the smell of wet hiker... What can you do though? We turned the AC on to try to clear the smell and headed out for an afternoon on the town. We tried out a couple of breweries, getting a couple flights at each to sample as much as possible, before grabbing BBQ for dinner (I had a slice of strawberry pie for dessert... gotta get fruit while you can!) and hitting a couple more breweries. We decided the best brewery we had visited was Funkatorium which specializes in sour beers. On our way back to the hotel for the evening we got yelled at/called hiker trash by someone across the street... good to see that someone understands us!We chilled back at the hotel for the rest of the night, repacked our bags with our now dry gear, and watched The Big Lebowski.","Clingman's Done

We were on the road by 7, navigating the labyrinth of foggy Asheville highways.As soon as we got out of the city the fog cleared and we rolled back towards the mountains... It was looking like a great day! As we approached, the day turned cloudy again (boooo) and we crossed over the location where the AT crossed I-40, where we'd be in only a couple days.We rolled back into town, returned the Jeep, and started walking towards the center of town, hoping for either the Gatlinburg trolley to come along or for someone to give us a ride. The trolley never came, but after about a mile of walking a woman, Alissa, picked us up and gave us a ride back to the NOC on her way to work. We got a great breakfast at Crockets Breakfast Camp, where we got the latest cinnamon bun we've ever seen (the size of a large cantalope) with super vanella-y frosting, in addition to our omelets. Perfect pre-trail meal!We caught the shuttle back to trail and saw our first bear!!! We were driving up the road to the gap and hit traffic about halfway up... the bear was chilling far up in a tree, oblivious to the fact that he was holding up traffic and of all the people who had pulled over to take pictures of him. We snapped a quick picture as we drove by but continued on our way to Clingman's Dome. Passing Newfound Gap we saw a couple groups doing trail magic, a good motivator for afternoon hiking!When we arrived back at the visitors center it was still sunny, but a menacing line of dark clouds was rolling in from the east so we hustled up the paved path to the top, blowing by the day hikers. The plan worked! We got our view! The cloud deck was only a couple hundred feet above the summit and a couple of low hanging patches of clouds were blowing past the tower, but we admired the mountains spread out below us.We snapped our pictures and then headed back onto the trail. Most of the afternoon was spent playing a long game of The Floor is Lava, avoiding the numerous patches of muddy trail while practicing our trail ninja skills. We moved quickly, trying to cover the 6.5mi to the gap in time to get the trail magic, however as we hiked a light rain started and then not long after thunder rumbled in the not-so-distance.We passed through a section of trail fenced off to protect it from boars that contained an endless meadow of small white flowers roofed with a canopy of beech trees and so after started the descent into the gap, Liz bolting ahead to try to get away from the thunder. I passed Christi who has the same gaiters as I do... great trail fashion sense!We reached the gap to find the trail magic packed up and gone... understandable given the weather, but still a bit disappointing. We snapped a picture with the sign for the TN/NC state line (which were still following) and then carried on climbing out of the gap. We passed a bunch of day hikers heading back to the gap, some had been more prepared for the rain than others and so were varying degrees of wet.Before starting today I had noticed that I had a small poison ivy blister on the bottom of my foot (no idea how that happened) which I had taped up before starting to try to prevent it from becoming an athletic blister, but it was still a bit of a bother throughout the afternoon. Side note: I'm a little bit pissed that I've been taking good enough care of my feet to not get a blister for 200 miles and then I end up getting one from poison ivy. I washed all my gear yesterday, so hopefully whatever transferred it there is now clean.We arrived at Icewater Spring Shelter and claimed our spot. This shelter was the aptly named, the spring indeed produced very cold water and also had a view! We watched throughout the evening as clouds rolled by and through the mountains below us until they eventually enveloped the camp for the rest of the evening. I made tacaroni for dinner... Mac'n'cheese with freeze dried chicken, crushed Ritz, and bits in a tortilla. We settled into the shelter for the night just as the rain started pounding down which providing pleasant noise to nod off to... rain is pretty nice when you're not in it. Liz, curious about the description of Gatlinburg, caught up with me in A Walk in the Woods. Based on the description in the book, the shelters in the Smokies have improved significantly in the past 20 years. Spoiler alert: Bryson and Katz yellow blaze to Virginia after Gatlinburg, so I won't have much to read for a while.","Clingman's Done

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561787,"The next morning rolled around and we, as usual, got up and got ready for today's hike. After taking some time to tape my foot to prevent my blister from getting worse (and taping the other foot to prevent a blister where I'm compensating the weight from the blistered foot) I went about my normal routine of packing up.As we left, the campsite was still cloaked in fog and it was only a mile until we reached Charlies Bunion, one of the better views along our route through the Smokies. We headed out to the bunion to find it completely surrounded by clouds, but a couple minutes of waiting rewarded us with a break in the clouds that were swirling over the ridges on both sides of the peak that the bunion jutted out from. We quickly snapped some pictures of the great view of the valley below as the clouds closed back in and we waited for our next opportunity, taking some timelapses of the chaotic clouds while we waited. The ridge we were traversing was acting as a wall, doing it's best to hold the mists at bay and directing their flow. Repeating the wait and scramble cycle a couple more times we got all of our pictures.Throughout the morning I noticed a cycle in our hiking... we'd traverse a narrow ridge, usually not more than ~30ft wide, walk around either the east or west side of a mountain, traverse another narrow ridge, walk up a mountain, walk another ridge, repeat. We walked along what seemed to be a dividing line between the dark clouds in the east and the light and sunny clouds in the west.Side note: When I use the directions ""east"" and ""west"" I'm referring to ""trail east"" and ""trail west"". As an AT hiker, all you really need to know is what side of the trail to expect things to be on, left or right. As a NOBO, everything marked ""east"" in the guide is to the right, everything marked ""west"" is to the left, everything ""north"" is father up trail, everything ""south"" is back along the trail. The AT in the Smokies is generally NorthEastern, so if you actually care what compass direction I'm talking about you'd have up figure it out.Anyways, along the way we ran into Bugeye and the 2 other members of his trail maintenance crew who had cleared the next 5mi of trail of trees with the chainsaw and tools they were hiking with. Props for carrying all that gear out with them. We let them know about a couple of trees we had climbed over in the past couple miles that we had hiked, thanked them for taking care of the trail, and continued on our way.We stopped at Bradley's View (Lookout's favorite in the park) for lunch and watched as darker clouds boiled over the mountain walls to our south and headed our way, a sure sign of rain this afternoon. We also noted how the terrain tended to direct wind upwards along these steep ridges, resulting in howling updrafts but relatively calm winds on the ridges themselves. We didn't daudle long and were soon back on the trail where we passed and chatted briefly with a Ridgerunner. For the next couple miles the signs of Bugeye's handiwork were obvious, with new chainsaw marks visible on the edges of several large trees which up until recently required climbing over. We got sprinkled on a couple times during the afternoon but the dense canopy diverted most of the rain and we reached the shelter by 2pm and took advantage of the transient sunshine to lay our hiking clothes out to dry. A number of other people trickled into camp, undecided as to if they'd stay for the night or take a short rest and move on, but none ended up electing to hike the 8mi to the next shelter.We hung out for the afternoon, ate 2 dinners (since we had gotten in so early), watched with some amusement as Fireproof hung his hammock from the rafters of the shelter, and eventually settled down to bed in the shelter as torrential rain fell onto the metal roof. Hopefully the people who decided to pitch a tent tonight stay dry... there are limits to what tents can protect from and this storm and it's waves of precipitation seems determined to test them. We discovered a leak in the shelter roof and we had to adjust a bit to make sure Liz didn't get dripped on, but all in all we're dry.","Icewater Spring Shelter
",Tri-corner Knob Shelter,"Apr 22, Sat",12.10
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561788,"Oh boy did it rain last night. The sound of the rain on the roof alternated between a pleasant background noise and a mildly worrying ""how much rain can this shelter take?"" throughout the night. Except for the one leak in the roof, which we were easily able to avoid, we had no issues. Last night we had planned on getting an early start, on the trail by 6 since Standing Bear Hostel located just outside of the Smokies doesn't take reservations, but both Lookout and I woke up to our alarms, rolled over, saw Liz (who takes the longest of us to get ready) still in her sleeping bag, and went back to sleep since the rain still echoed on the roof.We finally dragged ourselves out of our sleeping bags at 730, as everyone else in the shelter was getting ready. While we packed up we heard from a couple of the tenters who had setup in a bad spot and who had had a river flowing through their tent, or who had woken up in a pool of water, or who had had the seamsealing on their tent fail... not a good night for several people.A couple people, unwilling to deal with the rain today, decided to zero at the shelter by the time we set out into the rain at 9am. We did our best anti-raindance throughout the morning, jumping over mud, pole vaulting over puddles, and eventually just giving up and walking straight through the stream... I mean trail. The temperature was only in the high 40s and a fair amount of wind was buffeting the peaks and ridges we were crossing, so we moved pretty quickly to stay warm.We reached the next shelter and took a quick lunch, chatting with Ranger, who had decided to zero at the shelter, while we ate. Luckily she had a deck of cards to amuse herself with for the day, in addition to the hikers stopping through for a respite from the rain. During the past couple hours Liz's cotton gloves had gotten soaked and combined with the cramping from holding poles all morning had made her hands hard to use. She had a bit of trouble uncliping the straps of her pack, opening the wrapping of her lunch, and do any other dextrous tasks. Lookout and I were happy to help her, but it remains to be seen if she'll live it down (Possible trail name: thumbs?). Mildly warmer than when we arrived, we headed back out into the rain and to continue our decent out of the Smokies. Surprisingly, despite dropping ~4500ft today, our largest descent of the trail, my knees hurt less today than coming down into NOC, perhaps because the weather was such a good distraction.We finally reached to the Davenport Gap Shelter (sometimes called the Smokies Sheraton, though it wasn't particularly better equipped than any other Smokies shelters, so I'm not sure why) and then shortly after the northern boundary of the park. We dropped the second half of our permit in the collection box to indicate we left the park and continued on our way just as a bit of sunshine peaked through the clouds. It rained literally from when we stepped into the park to when we left it... figures.We continued descending and crossed a gushing stream 4 times. Though it's probably normally pretty easy to step over the stream on the rocks which had been arranged for that purpose, those rocks were covered in ankle deep water that we had at wade through. It wasn't a big deal because at that point though because we were so wet it didn't matter anyways. Before we knew it we had reached I-40, the sound of the stream and waterfalls masking the sounds of the highway until we were right next to it. We crossed under and headed up the other side of the gap the highway ran along, soon reaching Standing Bear Hostel.Though out of bunks, the hostel was letting the droves of hikers fleeing the Smokies sleep on the floor of the unfinished addition, in the barn, anywhere warm and dry. Liz, Lookout, and I got put in the addition with GoodTime and Fireproof, among others. We showered, Lookout and I each ate a pizza (after waiting for an hour for all the hikers in the line to use the pizza oven to finish), showered (would not recommend their outdoor shower, which was all that was available when I showered), grabbed some beers and hung out for the rest of the night.","Tri-corner Knob Shelter
",Standing Bear Hostel,"Apr 23, Sun",18.40
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562409,"Thankfully the rain has stopped by the time we woke up this morning, but the sky was still gray outside the windows of the unfinished addition we had slept in. No complaints here though... It was dry and warm.
We got about our morning chores, although slower than usual since Lookout and I weren't planning on leaving until noon since we only had 13 miles to do today. Liz's mom is meeting her at the hostel today and then hiking with Liz for 4 days to Hot Springs, so she's staying behind. Lookout and I are planning to hike to and camp on top of Max Patch, a bald mountain that will hopefully give us a really amazing sunrise, stars, and sunset. The forecast doesn't look particularly promising for it, but though this mountain is supposed to be really good, there will be other balds if it isn't, so it's not worth taking a zero over. We're trying to convince Liz to skip ahead to wherever we are when her mom leaves and rejoin us, but we'll see what happens.
Throughout the morning I picked up 2 days of food from the little store at the hostel, charged my cell phone and external battery pack, and dried my socks in the dryer, but by 11am both Lookout and I had run out of things to do and were getting a bit antsy and so decided to get hiking. Liz walked us down to the trail to give us ""a big long drawn out Texas goodbye"" and after a couple hugs Lookout and I were on our way.
The first order of business today was a 2500ft climb out of the gap and back into the mountains. Though long, the climb wasn't particularly steep and Lookout and I were able to power up it with relative ease. The sun was shining (the first time in 6days!) in between occasional clouds while we hiked. Across the valley we could see the edge of the Smokies with some of the day off peaks still wreathed in clouds even on this gorgeous day.
It has been pretty interesting... I don't think I've ever experienced spring so many times as this year. I've been hiking into and back out of spring regularly, sometimes several times a day, as we climb and descend. As we ascended and move back in time the fully bloomed leaves return to buds and the bright green new foliage reverts back to the browns and grays of dormant trees.
Lookout and I (to the dismay/teasing of some other hikers) cruised up the endless series of hills, some fairly steep, up towards max patch. We eventually topped out and came across a FAA VOR navigational system installation, the first of a couple I think we pass on the hike. Along the way we found YardDart, who I had met at Standing Bear the night before (he isn't hiking the trail, but is supporting his wife, Mrs Bobby, as she hikes. He meets up with her whenever he can and sleeps in the back of their Honda Element) in a gap offering TRAIL MAGIC in the form of cookies, drinks, fruit, and slices of a bagguette (sounds weird, but white bread tastes REALLY good right now).
We hit the trail again, climbed another steep hill, filled up enough water to last the night, and made our final climb of the day onto Max Patch. We passed through a horse gate and emerged from the woods onto a giant hilly meadow, stretching over multiple peaks. The top of this mountain had once been cleared and used as pastureland for livestock and now offers spectacular views of the surrounding countryside to hikers. It took a couple minutes of hiking to actually reach the top during which we noticed a wall is fog rolling in from the west. Noooooooo. We reached the peak, frantically enjoyed the remaining eastward view, and not 5 minutes later were enveloped in the mists. Visibility dropped to the point where you could barely make out sillouettes at 100ft, the temperature dropped about 15deg over the course of the next 15min, a little bit of wind picked up, cell service disappeared, and our plans of camping at the summit evaporated just as quickly as our views had.
We reluctantly shouldered our packs and continued down the trail, taking the 2mi to the next shelter quickly as rain began to fall. We hit camp, took stock of the shelter situation, decided we didn't want to share the shelter with the current inhabitants, and went to setup our tents in the rain. We returned to the protection of the shelter to make dinner and hung out with Lipstick, Missionary, Kelsey, Kali, Honeybunz, Hinz, LeftFoot, and Diesel.
While we were eating the (in)famous baby couple walked by (they're hiking with their infant... One carries the pack, one carries the infant in a backpack carrier on their back), but they moved on since apparently they don't camp with others if they can help it (to protect the baby). 
It's unfortunate... I had carried a small stick of body glide for the first 200 miles, but ditched it in Asheville since I hadn't used it. Well, not 2 days after getting rid of it, the constant rain-induced wetness of my hiking clothes resulted in some mild chafing. It's not bad enough to slow me down or cause issues, but it's still annoying. 
Also, Liz is potentially trying out the trail name ""Classy"" (hence the post's title), since the first thing she's going to do once she gets off trail is get a manicure/pedicure/facial and she enjoys talking fashion, so we'll see if this one sticks.
We made plans to share room with Lipstick, missionary, etc in hot springs tomorrow night... just 18 miles to get there. We're going to get a pretty early start and try to get into town fairly early so that we can get food and relax since we're not planning to zero there.","Standing Bear Hostel
",Roaring Fork Shelter,"Apr 24, Mon",15.20
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562410,"A owl kindly acted as my alarm clock this morning, hooting a couple of minutes before 7. The rain was still coming down lightly, but I had stayed mostly dry overnight.
Side note: I'm starting to come to the opinion that non-freestanding tents are not ideal... Or maybe I'm not doing it right. The tent spot I setup on last night (one of the last 3 available) was about 6in too short for my tent (which is particularly long), which resulted in the rain fly resting on the bug netting and transferring water to it. Every time a big fat rain drop would fall from a tree and hit the tent a little shower would ensure within the tent. This is the first time that's happened, but I've also had issues with the rain fly not being taught if there isn't enough width. Not a huge issue, but something to think about.
Anyways, I packed up pretty quickly and hit the trail, eating a poptart and cinnamon bun on the trail. It rained/dripped on us all morning as we hiked through the dense fog. We hiked through the ghostly apperations of trees as they appeared from the mist and across another bald. Thankfully the posts bearing blazes were just close enough to be in view through the fog and we soon came to another shelter. The raindrops falling on the metal roof were audible even before the shelter was visible the fog was so dense.
I took a short break at the shelter until Lookout arrived and then we cruised the 12mi into town. Honeybunz caught up with us and we may have gotten a little excited and basically ran down the last hill into town. We covered our 18mi for the day in 5hours 45min, including the couple of quick breaks we took, and it was only 115pm. The trail runs straight through the center of town (Hot Springs really only has one street) and the sidewalk has placks/blazes embedded into it periodically. We had agreed to meet at the Dollar General until everyone made it to town before getting food, so Lookout, Honeybunz, and I got frosty beverages at the gas station next door and sat on a shady section of trail and enjoyed our drinks. We hadn't booked lodging yet, so after about a half an hour the 3 of us decided that it would probably be a better idea if we just booked it on behalf of the group, rather than waiting for everyone to get to town (which was looking like it might be another couple hours). 
After calling a couple places and getting put on hold, we decided that it would just be quicker to walk down the street to them, so with Lookout watching the packs (and enjoying a beverage), Honeybunz and I headed into town. We got prices at the local motel before running into Tom and Matt (2 of Honeybunz's friends) who had booked a room at Creekside Court and were looking for hikers to split it with. Though adding the 2 of them would mean trying to fit 10 hikers in a room with 2 queen beds, we decided we could make it work and returned to grab our packs.
As the sun was shining, a rare occurrence, the first order of business was laying our soaked gear out to dry, followed by showers. People eventually trickled in and settled in... Lipstick got another room because she wanted a real bed for the night and Kali got a room at a hostel, so we ended up with plenty of space for everyone.
All showered and presentable (as much as hikers get anyways) we headed down to the Smoky Mountain Diner we had passed on our way into town. This place knows how to deal with hikers. So much food for so little money. I got a double cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and a slice of strawberry rhubarb pie. 
Everybody was super stuffed after dinner so we got some beer, wine, and cider from the gas station and headed back to our place to hangout. We were slowed down a little bit by the anti hiker barrier (a knee high concrete block wall) that had been placed around the gas station that we couldn't seem to lift our stiff legs high enough to step over, but managed to find a way around.
When we got back we found that Hinds, Diesel, and LeftFoot had also gotten a room and so grabbed some chairs and hung out out outside their room. Silus went on an adventure to find a corkscrew, which was eventually successful. Diesel declared that it was unacceptable that such a large group, who had been hiking together so long, didn't have trail names yet and than anybody without a trail name would be forced to zero until they got one. The ensuing trail name party resulted in Matt becoming OnionWhisperer (Yun for short), Kelsey becoming Hils, Kali becoming The Pronator (Nate for short), Silus (formerly Missionary) becoming Pepper, and Tom (who was missing at the time, a reoccurring theme) becoming Waldo. 
As we watched the sunset on the hills around town we ran low on drinks and were a bit hungry, so we walked down to the Dollar General and picked up a few snacks (I also resupplied 4 days to make it to Erwin, TN), hit the gas station again for more drinks, and wandered back through the empty street of town to our place.
Yun, Lookout, and Fireproof got a fire going and Lookout, Fireproof, LeftFoot, and I ended up staying up till midnight chatting about a bunch of things after everyone else had gone to bed. I ended up sharing a room with Not bad (who slept on the floor), Lookout, Yun, and Waldo.
All and all it kinda felt like a zero even though we hiked 18 miles this morning. It's really fun to be hanging with a new group of people, they're all cool people, and it looks like we might be hiking with them for the next couple days.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562411,"This town knows hikers... the public library, right across from where we're staying, has amazing WiFi. It took like 10min to upload 160pics, which was super nice since the last couple places I've been have had really bad WiFi.
The morning started foggy but the skies above were clear and the fog dissapated pretty quickly. We had agreed to get breakfast at 1030, so I held off on eating and went and took care of my resupply at the outfitter. I got a new outfit (shorts with pockets for camp and a lighter shirt for hiking in), a bit of food, and some postcards.  I also hit the post office to mail a postcard that I hadn't had the postage for previously and mailed a box home with my StickPic, a couple stuff sacks, and my long johns (hope I don't regret that, but I haven't been cold recently, we won't be super high again for a while, and I want something better to wear around camp/town).
Nate, Lipstick, Hils, Honeybunz, Pepper, Lookout, NotBad, and I all went back to the diner for breakfast. Lookout and I both got breakfast skillets, a pan filled with potato wedges with 2 eggs, sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheese, 4 slices of toast, and a side of a pancake. It was a struggle but I managed to finish mine... Lookout eventually admitted defeat and couldn't finish it.
After breakfast we re-doned our hiking shoes and headed out of town. I had to double back and hit the Dollar General again to get a new pair of headphones, but it turns out it's the USB-C to 3.5mm jack converter that's broken, not the headphones, which is a pain because those aren't common. I'll probably have to get a spare mailed to me.
Leaving town required crossing the French Broad River will was overflowing it's banks from all the recent rain. After crossing the bridge we followed the river for a couple hundred yards before the trail took a steep upward bend and ascended a rocky cliff, which combined with the sun created so much sweat... So much for being clean. A couple miles father the trail passes a small dam (maybe 30ft high and ~50 across) which holds a murky pond... if only it were clear I would've gone for a swim.
I crossed a road via an overpass and climbed a mountain to a tower where I was hoping to camp for the night to catch the great view we missed on Max Patch. I was actually hoping to cowboy camp on top of the tower if it was open, but it wasn't and the view was mostly obscured by trees, so we moved on to the next shelter and setup camp with our temporary tramily.
Our campsite looked like an advertisement for Bug Agnes, since half the tents were identical. We all made and ate dinner, hanging out and chatting as we did (everyone here prefers to hike solo, so morning and evening are the prime social opportunities). A couple of hikers had hiked in smores ingredients (marshmallows,  chocolate, and chips ahoy cookies) and invited us to make some on the fire. We graciously accepted and helped them lighten their packs before heading to bed.
Hot Springs is located at mile 273.4, so leaving town today solidifies this as my longest trip by milage ever (previous was Long Trail), which is exciting.","Hot Springs, NC
",Spring Mountain Shelter,"Apr 26, Wed",11
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562412,"This morning was nice... I got out of camp fairly early and was listening to music for the first couple miles. We got a bit of light rain which forced me to stop and batten down the hatches and put the music away, but it wasn't bad. 
Today is Hils birthday, so Lipstick is attempting to plan a little thing to celebrate. We had heard a rumor that there's a little store in the next gap, so the plan was to check it out. I happen to run into Lipstick right before we got there, so we headed down to check it out. The store didn't even look like it was in operation anymore... It had broken windows, the signs were all hand written, the lawn wasn't mowed... even if it was still operating, it definitely wasn't open, so we moved on. (Turns out it is still in operation and opens at 9am, but it was still super sketchy).
A couple miles father down the trail we hit a road which the guide indicated had a hostel which sold ""cold drinks"". Predictably, we had no service at that point, so someone had to go down to the hostel and check it out. Since I hike faster than Lipstick anyways, I volunteered to head down, and walked the 0.5mi down the road to see what they had. Unfortunately they didn't have an alcohol license and so didn't sell beer, so I grabbed a couple of sodas instead. 
At the point we have a fairly large group, so I ended up packing 6 cans of sodas and 2 apple juice boxes (neither Lipstick nor I drink soda) out with me. I managed to grab a shuttle back to the gap and immediately felt the 6lbs I had just added to my pack on the long uphill. 
I took lunch at the shelter with Lookout before continuing onwards, listening to some podcasts as I walked. I came across a side trail that the guide indicated led to the cell/other towers visible on the top of the mountain, so I dropped pack and headed up there to check it out. The views weren't the best, but they were definitely better than the guide insinuated and I could see the lovely sunny day that the planes were having as dark clouds hung over the mountains. I ended up jogging back down to the trail, feeling very light without my pack and jumped back on the AT.
I caught up to Lipstick and chatted with her for a few minutes at a quick break and then continued on until I reached a section of trail that crossed an exposed ridgeline. There was a bypass trail (for use in inclement weather), but I decided to stick to the AT despite the couple sprinkles of rain and moderate winds that I had felt. This section of trail had some light scrambling, really the first so far on the AT, but rewarded that effort with some great views. To the west Tennessee stretched out before me, very flat and teeming with what looked to be farms and roads between the fields enjoying a lovely sunny day. To the east North Carolina mountains sprawled, untamed except for one visible road and covered by dark clouds which capped many of the mountains which stood at my eye level.
It wasn't far to camp thankfully, as the extra pack weight had taken its toll throughout the day. My knees were hurting a bit, the first time on the trail, probably due to the extra weight I was carrying. Maybe not my best idea... Just as I entered camp I passed the 300mile marker, a nice end for the day of hiking.
Only Lipstick, Hils, Lookout, and I were at camp and so after establishing camp for the night we convened at the shelter and made dinner. Hils finished dinner and was about to brush get teeth so Lipstick had no choice but to spring the surprise, despite the absence of the rest of the gang. Lipstick revealed the beer she had packed for Hils and I the sodas for everyone else. Hils enjoyed the surprise beer and we enjoyed our sodas/juice just as Honeybunz pulled into camp. Apparently Pepper's pack had ripped that morning (he was using a really old, hand me down, pack) and so he, Pepper, and Nate had gone down to the hostel, gotten a shuttle back to Hot Springs, and had gotten him a new pack, which had taken most of the afternoon. He also revealed the beers they had picked up in town, which we dug into. Pepper arrived next, but Nate didn't show up. Presumably she decided to camp somewhere as dusk fell and would catch up in the morning.","Spring Mountain Shelter
",Jerry Cabin Shelter,"Apr 27, Thu",15.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562421,"The first order of business this morning was summiting Big Butt Mt. Big Butt is a bald, so I walked through a dewy field filled with spider webs gleaming in the morning sun. To the west Tennessee was convered by a sea of fog... massive in comparison to the lakes of fog we had seen in the mountains. A bit past the field I came across a giant bolder standing vertically that had a giant crack down the center partitioning it into two equal sized... cheeks? Perhaps that's where the name comes from? 
I was on cobweb duty this morning as the first hiker down the trail, clearing the cobwebs which had been erected on the trail overnight as I hiked. Thankfully the brilliant sunshine illuminated most of them so that I could swing my pole and clear them with something other than my face.
As I hiked we got some views to the north through the trees... the mountains look like they stretch on forever northward which means we have a lot more hiking to do. Not a bad thing.
Sidenote: It's kinda cool that we're planning for what we're going to do when we hit Damascus, VA, 150mi up ahead since it's only a little more than a week away. We started the trip planning like 40mi in advance, so that's a measure of progress.
Also, a while back we were chatting with someone who thru hiked last year... he was musing that for the first 2-3 weeks hikers talk about gear and from then on the conversation is mostly about food. We've definitely passed the gear phase... At this point most people with way too much gear have dropped out or ditched the gear and the gear that everyone does have now has been working well enough for them for the past month. Not to say that people don't still occasionally talk about their gear, but it's an interesting shift.
Also, my poison ivy is almost gone, which is super nice. The blisters are dry and closed and are just red with some small scabs. Hopefully even that will be fully gone soon, but it's no longer a bother.
As I continued hiking I noticed that someone was having fun wiring in mud, drawing smiley faces and AT symbols every so often. I also saw an owl flying between trees to my west as I hiked, but he didn't come very close to the trail. My knees are still a bit sore, presumably from the extra weight yesterday. Up until now my knees have gotten a bit sore some days, but they've always healed/felt fine by the next morning. This is the first time that's not the case, so I'll have to watch them and try to rest them for the next couple days so that I don't start accumulating damage.
We hit a gap and I checked my phone and had great service, better even than up on the ridges... Go figure. Also, interestingly, from this gap for the next 15mi the trail heads compass south (that's why trail-east/trail-west are useful for navigation, because as a hiker you don't have to care which direction the trail is facing).
At the shelter that I stopped at for a quick break and met Huggable from Portland, Maine who, in response to my name, told me about a guy who crushes beer cans with his bare foot... sounds like a terrible idea. As I continued hiking I walked through a grasshopper/cricket rain... they must've just hatched or something because walking along a sunny section of trail it sounds like it was raining as the thousands of them jumped out of my way.
I hit a road and walked 0.5mi to try to find the hostel that the guide listed, hoping for a drink or treat. Turns out I can't read a guide and went down the wrong road. Oh well, what's an extra mile? I got back on trail, trekked through a field of lovely smelling wildflowers while some early dandelion puffs floated through the air, hiked a bit further to the correct road, went down that, and found that the hostel in the guide had closed. There was another hostel, but without a store, so I just setup my tent to let it dry in the sun and ate my lunch.
From there I headed uphill, past a nice stream with a series of waterfalls, and over a series of rolling mountain tops. The sun got hotter as the afternoon wore on and the trees, which once again held no leaves, didn't provide much cover. I ran into Lookout at the next shelter, 16mi into our day, and we confirmed that we were both good to push towards the next shelter which would leave us at almost 26mi for the day. I cameled and tanked up on water and hit the trail again for the couple miles down to Sam's Gap where we crossed I-26.
As with everything that goes down on the AT, it must come back up, and we hiked up a long uphill to regain the altitude we had lost throughout the day. The ridge we we're heading for was adorned with condos, which spoiled the view a little bit, but I spotted a bald mountain up ahead. Sure enough, the guide confirmed it as Big Bald and it was just a mile short of the shelter we were heading for. After conferencing with Lookout, we tanked up to capacity to give us enough water for the night and finished the ascent. We emerged from the sparse trees onto the open plane with a good breeze keeping the air cool. The bald offered a panoramic view of everything we had just hiked, Erwin (where we'd be tomorrow), and the surrounding mountains. 
We setup camp but that light breeze turned out to be not so light and we had to make sure everything was weighted or tied down so that it wouldn't fly away. We cooked dinner and watched the sun as it headed for the horizon. The sun turned blood red as it fell, the haze which caused the mountains to fade off into the distance scattering the sun's light. Before the sun reached the mountains it had entirely disappeared into the haze... not a usual sunset, but nonetheless pretty.
We headed to bed as the sliver of a moon emerged... Hopefully the wind settles down a bit overnight. I think my tent will handle it, the winds are probably ~20-30mph but I've got it staked down and weighted with rocks on every tieout. We'll see.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562423,"I was hopeful that the wind would calm down during the night after the sun has stopped dumping energy into the atmosphere, but the winds kept up all night. I woke up pretty frequently to a particularly loud gust or two, even with earplugs in. I got up once at 4am for a bit and briefly took in the stars... without light pollution even the milky way was visible in the sky and the valleys below also had little stars dotted throughout them. Unfortunately it was too cold and windy to enjoy them for long, so I retreated back to my tent for a bit more sleep.
Both Lookout and I were up at first light and started breaking down camp as the sky brightened. We watched as the sun rose from the opposite direction as it set, the earth having completed half a rotation while we slumbered (obvious, but kinda cool to think about). 
Lookout hit the trail at about 650 and I elected to wait a few more minutes at the summit for the remainder of the sunrise. The trail followed the field which continued down and across a lower peak, so I watched as Lookout (and a couple deer) traversed the field. I followed soon after and after leaving the field re-entered the sparse forest, carpeted by think green grass and brush, which surrounded the mountain-top field. I ran into a couple more deers here and watched them bound away, gliding through the low flora with obscene grace. It was here, I would later find out, that Lookout had run into a bear that promptly scampered off into the forest when he hit his poles together. I, less than 5min behind him, didn't see anything... oh well, early hiker gets the bear.
I continued to move along, descending and passing through a gap with a deserted road, and ascending up a notch containing a stream. The stream generated a cool breeze and the fact that the sun hadn't yet reached this part of the trail was a nice relief from the sun. I ran into an ATC volunteer picking mustard weed, an invasive plant in the area, and chatted with him for a few minutes before continuing on.
I also suspect that it's somewhere near butterfly mating time because there are a lot of very colorful butterflies (males?) dancing with rather drab looking moths (females?) along the trail.
The last 6 miles to town was dry, so I grabbed some water at the last shelter and tackled the home stretch into town. With about 1.5mi to town I finished the liter I had grabbed as the heat of the day really started to takes its toll. The trail wound down a series of switchback along a ridge which sloped into the river, so each trip out to the tip of the ridge rewarded me with a tantilizing view of Erwin and the river slightly closer, but still out of reach. That water looked so nice while hiking through the hot sun. 
Did I mention it was hot? Because that's likely to become a theme for the summer. The sun and I are not necessarily best friends. I'm fine with cold because I can just work harder to generate heat and stay warm, but there's not much that can be done about a warm day (at least not on the trail).
I finally reached the road at the bottom and immediately headed for the river, stopping to soak my feet in the blissfully cool water for a few minutes. On the way to the river I had passed a sign for a free hiker cookout put on by a local church, so I headed over to that and got a couple burgers, hot dogs, roast beef, and the sides. Lookout arrived shortly after and ate his fill before we headed to Uncle Johnny's hostel, and checked in. The bunks and cabins were full which only left tent space so we elected to tent down by the river which will hopefully be a little cooler tonight. We took a shower, did laundry, and grabbed the shuttle to Walmart where we had 25min to shop before the shuttle headed back to the hostel (and would leave you behind). I resupplied and grabbed some strawberries, bananas, and chocolate milk to snack on as well as some beer to enjoy tonight. 
We headed back to the hostel and stuffed ourselves with the loaded baked potatoes that an independent gear salesman had cooked to contribute to the festivities. After dinner came apple, blueberry, peach, strawberry, and cherry pies with ice cream... At this point it kinda hurt to eat more but it was sooooo good. As dinner wrapped up I lounged in the hammock hanging on the deck while a hiker grabbed a guitar and another grabbed a 5gal water cooler bottle (to use as a set of conga drums) and jammed for a while.
The hostel put on a (not very popular) talent show and then the gear rep raffled off a bunch of gear. I won a Granite Gear hiker wallet, which I unfortunately already have, so I donated my prize to the hiker box and someone who actually needs it.
It's pretty warm tonight, so I'm going to try to sleep in only my sleeping bag liner and hope that I don't get too hot. I've got the rainfly on my tent open, so hopefully that let's some sure through. A taste of what's to come this summer.","Big Bald
","Erwin, TN","Apr 29, Sat",18
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562422,"We had a lazy morning charging our electronics and hanging out at the hostel. I packed my food bag with my resupply stuff, changed my contacts (I have the ones you wear for a month at a time, so it's much easier to change them while in town than on the trail), and de-splosioned my pack. 
I weighed my pack on their scale, I'm at 20.6lbs base weight (no food or water... I started at 17lbs but have added some stuff: a dry sack for my sleeping bag, wet wipes to wash off some of the sweat off with at camp each night, a spare headlamp (from when mine broke... Need to send the spare home when I can), etc) and 31.5lbs fully loaded with 1L of water and 4 days of food. It's not the lightest (there's a guy with a fully loaded weight of 19lbs), but it's manageable and working well for me, which is what counts.
Classy and her mom, who had been dubbed Mrs Pots during their week on the trail, got here at around 11 and we headed into town to get some lunch. We ended up a Bojangles, a chicken place that I've never been to before, but it ended up being really good (at least by hiker standards). I got a garden salad (greens are sorely lacking on the trail) and a Jambolia bowl (rice, chicken, beans, etc... It's 1200calories, which is pretty efficient calories/$). Mrs Pots dropped us back at the hostel (which is basically on trail) and rather than saddling up immediately we ended up chilling for a couple hours until some of the heat of the day passed. We planned for the next couple days of hiking and finally motivated ourselves to hike at around 3pm.
Once we started hiking we took our time, trying to keep from getting too gross in the warm weather, but the first decent hill had us all sweating again. Thankfully we only had one climb for the day and it was relatively short, and soon enough we came to a helpful sign someone had left on the trail telling us that the water source at the shelter was dry and that we should fill up at the stream. We tanked up and soon reached the shelter.
We reached the shelter to find it ""full"" with 4 people taking naps. Since they were managing to take up the entire shelter, we couldn't unpack or setup our gear, so we hung around and made a little fire to pass some time (and the hatchet left at the shelter was dull as a hammer, so using it to chop some wood for the first might've helped wake them up). 
Eventually they woke up, packed up, and moved on so we could move into the shelter. We made dinner and settled down for the night. The shelter, being only 4mi from town, wasn't heavily used, and we were only sharing with one other person. We had a mini movie night in the shelter, using Lookout's phone to watch the first 1/3 of the movie Braveheart before we all got too tired and decided to finish it another night.","Erwin, TN
",Curly Maple Gap Shelter,"Apr 30, Sun",4.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562705,"We woke up in the morning to find that no rain has fallen overnight like it had been predicted, which was just as well. We hiked through the morning, Classy fell in a stream, and we watched as the rain moved in throughout the morning. We got sprinkled on in the morning, but overall stayed pretty dry.
As we ascended we started to feel the full force of the wind, which was blowing up to ~35mph. We caught up with BirdPerson on a bald ridge and watched the clouds flow over nearby mountains until we nearly got blown over by a particularly strong gust and decided it was time to move on.
We hiked on, climbing a mountain up into a dense spruce forest which had a very alpine feel. Though the rain started warm in the morning, throughout the day it turned cold and by lunch time we had all donned rain jackets to keep warm.
The rest of the afternoon passed pretty slowly to me, the rain and wind kept up and the miles started to wear on. None of us were in much of a mood for conversation and I'm still trying to get a new headphone cable, so I can only listen to things through my phone's speakers, which I can't do in the rain. We hiked through an old apple orchard with a couple of large trees which were in bloom and probably provide a nice treat to SOBOs in the fall. 
Eventually we got to Greasy Creek Gap (not the most attractive name) and headed down an old forest road. We had decided to head for a hostel for the night since it was only $10 and was only 2 miles short of our intended destination, which we could easily make up tomorrow without changing our plans. We hiked the 0.6mi downhill to the hostel (I'm sure we'll looove the extra uphill in the morning), checked in, grabbed showers, hung our clothes to dry, and then chilled for the afternoon. 
Gadget, one of the owners of the hostel, has 955 movies on his laptop (he's proud of that number) and so we watched Passengers (recent SciFi movie) and O Brother, Where Art Thou and then the other hikers decided on watching Mad Max. The other hostel owner (NAME) had kindly offered to pick up food for the hikers while she was in town and that food was promptly demolished when it arrived during Mad Max.
The movie ended at ~11pm, way past our bedtime, so we headed out to the bunkhouse for the night. The storms must've been a cold front moving through because it's turned fairly chilly outside. I'm nice and warm in my sleeping bag in the bunkhouse for the night though.","Curly Maple Gap Shelter
",Greasy Creek Gap,"May 01, Mon",20
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563288,"We got a late start this morning. We were all up at the usual time but the night had stayed cold so we headed into the main house of the hostel to warm up and I had some of the free tea (blueberry) while Classy and Lookout enjoyed the free coffee. I had some oatmeal from the hiker table for breakfast and we eventually motivated ourselves to pack up, don our clothing (still damp from yesterday's rain), and start the 0.6mi back to the trail at about 1015.
We all agreed that the Greasy Creek Friendly was the best hostel we've stayed at thus far.It wasn't the fanciest, most organized, or even cleanest, but it was comfortable, communal, and friendly. The owners of the hostel Cici and Gadget are essentially inviting you into their home and are extremely helpful in any way they can be. It turns out, that for all the time it took to organize, buy, bring back, and distribute the food orders of the 15 hikers here last night from 4 different restaurants, they charged for the food at cost, which was unexpected and very kind. They are strict about some things... You have to take your shoes off in the house and you have to wash your hands when you come in and before you use the kitchen, but they're very relaxed about everything else... good set of priorities. They're not paying me or anything, we just enjoyed our time there.
Before leaving Cici gave us all a hug and wished us a super butterfly day (since butterflies only fly in the nicest weather) and we were off. The 0.6mi that we swore was longer at the end of yesterday was easy this morning, despite it being uphill back to the trail. In no time we were back to cruising the AT. The morning air started with the crispness of a fall morning but any chill was easily dispelled by the sun's rays making it PERFECT hiking weather.
We moved through the gently rolling hills quickly, slowly gaining altitude as we went and stopped at the first shelter to refill on water and eat first-lunch. We didn't daudle long as we had a long way to go for the day and were soon back on the trail.
As I got moving again the trail wound through a number of grassy knolls, twisting back and forth across the ridge to try to maintain a decent grade. Some of these offered views in various directions, towards a bald in the distance, back to the spruce covered peak from yesterday, over to the hill we had summited earlier in the day.
I passed through Ash Gap (affectionately know as Beartown) on high alert, determined to not be the second one to know about a bear/human encounter. I didn't end up seeing any wildlife, probably due to the volume of hikers coming through the area, but the glade itself was very pleasant. Sunlight filtered down through the canopy and onto the rich green carpet as I hiked through.
I caught up to Classy at the peak and we decided to have lunch at the site of an old hotel, long since demolished, which once treated guests to views of the surrounding terrain. Part of the foundation of the hotel was still visible amongst the rhotodendron bushes which ringed the grassy field which one was the hotel. While we ate we enjoyed the sunny, clear blue sky which faded to light blue at the horizon and the slightly darker blue of the mountains in the distance which darkened as they get closer. Puffy white clouds floated through sky, small and moving fast so that they only dimmed the sun for a couple seconds as they passed in front of it and casting shadows across landscape below. Personally I was glad that the summit wasn't yet open to the public for the year... tons of people milling around would've severely detracted from the experience.
We eventually got moving again and I swear that if someone told me that I had amnesia and had forgotten the last 1400 miles and was in Vermont, I would've believed them. Everything from the moss on the forest floor, the coniferous composition of the trees, the rocky outcrops, the rocky and muddy trail, the cool air felt like it could've been part of the Long trail I hiked last fall.
We reached Carter's Gap and found TRAIL MAGIC in the form of Gatorade and beer in a cooler on the back of a pickup. As we were finishing our treats the angel showed up, 2sole who had hiked in 2015. We eventually got moving again at about 430, most of the afternoon having been consumed by the late lunch and treat. We still had 6 miles up cover to the shelter, so it was time to get moving.
We hiked across another series of balds while chatting with Liz and admiring the great views. 2sole said that this was one of his favorite sections of the AT and I can see why, the balds give unparalleled panoramic views on beautiful days such as this and are unique compared to all other parts of the trail.
We passed a deserted shelter at 530 and kept moving towards our destination for the night, Overmountain shelter. We finally arrived at 6pm to find a tent city which had sprung up around the shelter. The shelter itself was an old 2 story red barn that had been donated/turned into a shelter for hikers. Besides the space it offered though, the best part (and the reason for it's popularity) was the view. Staying at the shelter affords a view straight down a valley, bordered by two tall mountains/ridges. The bottom of the valley was dotted with green fields and the sky was dotted with puffy white clouds which resembled various animals floating along.
It was my turn to hang a bear bag, which I attempted to do but ended up getting the throw sack stuck up in the tree (the first time that's happened to me). The tree was climbable, but upon closer inspection turned out to have thorns. Those just made the climb and re-hang more interesting. 
We all made dinner, enjoyed it as the sun set over the mountains and turned the sky and clouds pastel colors. We watched Braveheart for an hour, all 3 of us crammed into Classy's 1man tent... well, half of the 3 of us were in the tent... the rest of us was out the door. Classy and I watched the stars come out and several satellites pass overhead before heading to bed. I left my rainfly up (as in, not covering my tent) for the night so that I could see the stars. While drifting off to sleep I noticed a light moving up high on the hill, a night hiker working their way across the bald.
I definitely got sun today... My thighs got pretty burnt, probably while Classy and I were having lunch in the field at the summit of Roan. That's going to hurt tomorrow.","Greasy Creek Gap
",Overmountain Shelter,"May 02, Tue",17.50
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563289,"I got up to water the grass at 3am and after clearing the sleep from my eyes woke up to the AMAZING stars. Since I already had my fly rolled back I just opened the tent door and rolled it back since there were no bugs. My tent is supported by treking polls so lI retracted one to partially collapse the tent and allow me an unobstructed view of the sky... a sort of hybrid cowboy camping. The milky way was plainly visible and I could even see nebulae/dust clouds blocking the star light, lightyears away from Earth. I watched several satellites trace through sky (8 or so) and even 10 or so shooting stars while I drifted off back to sleep.
It got cold overnight, but I was cozy in my bag. I watched the sky lighten and the stars disappear with Venus being the last star to go. I was waiting for Classy to wake up before I got up but I dozed off and she got up and grabbed the bear bags before I woke up. 
The pack is light since there's no food and it was a beautiful sunny day, so the hike up the hill was nice. We got a view looking back on barn from hill and more bald mountains up ahead. As we crested the first bald I thought I lost my buff, which was very sad since it's a versatile piece of gear. I turned back for a couple hundred feet to look for it, but it turns out I was actually wearing it in pirate mode as sun protection. Crisis avoided.
It was interesting to see the parade of hikers working their way up the balds. While there probably weren't more hikers in the trail than normal, we're usually in wooded areas and so can't see each other and how close everyone is to eachother.
We descended off the bald and hit our next milestone, the NC/TN border! We had been walking the border for the past couple hundred miles and had finally reached our last steps in NC. 2 down, 12 to go! For the next 70mi we'd be in TN and then onto VA. 
We cruised the last couple miles down to the road and found TRAIL MAGIC. Dave was offering sodas and ride to town for any hikers. I ended up in back of the truck and we set a record for the most hikers in his truck with 12 hikers. Dave dropped us at Bobs Dairybar where we I got a burger, salad, onion rings, and strawberry shake. After eating we quickly resupplied and got a ride back to trail, with me and several hikers again in the back of Dave's truck.
We hit the trail again and cruised over relatively easy terrain until we found Jones Falls. To paint a picture... We were sitting on a rocky outcrop to right of the lower falls. The water at top came from a stream and split into multiple streams, some being catapulted into the air by the shape of the rock and some flowing down the face of the rock, which glistening in the sun. Those streams then drop down ~30ft into a pool hidden from view from my vantage point. The water then overflowed that pool onto slabs of rock where the water pooled and flowed laterally in cracks before it coallecing and flowed out of sight below us.
We enjoyed the falls for a couple minutes, which was a nice rest for my knees after all the downhill today with our heavy packs. After hitting the trail again we followed a river along it's grassy banks before hitting another milestone: 400 miles! 
It was only a little ways longer to Mountaineer shelter, our home for the night. This was a nice shelter... the broom had a handle, the shelter shovel was long handled, there were 3 levels including a loft, the cooking area had benches and were the right height for using the table. We setup and cooked dinner as the group of guys from a religious retreat group made a fire, which we joined them in enjoying for a while before heading to bed.","Overmountain Shelter
",Mountaineer Shelter,"May 03, Wed",18
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563290,"We woke up and the rain had not yet started. We got ready along with MiddleBrother and Frisbee, who had also stayed at the shelter last night. I ended up heading out a few minutes early, intending to take it easy on my knees and to hopefully have some extra time to enjoy the trail. The trail for the first couple hours was fairly easy, gradually rising and falling over the contours of the land. This is the first time that I can remember that it's felt like I was hiking through the lowlands... water was plentiful from the many streams I hiked over, the flora had fully bloomed into spring, and the terrain was fairly gradual.
As I was hiking I came across a bench on the trail, the same that you'd expect to see positioned in any city park. I stopped for a few minutes to enjoy the view... the bench was set under a tree which, had the day been sunnier, would have provided much appreciated protection from the sun's intense rays. The trees in front of bench had been cut a while ago and were slowly growing back, most standing less than 20ft tall on the hill which sloped down away from the bench.  Over the tops of the trees stood a series of overlapping wooded hills, their trees coloring the hills with various shades of green and brown as the trees grew their new leaves. In the distance, an imposing line of mountains, the balds we traversed, punctured the thick grey clouds as they flew past. Beyond them blue sky was visible through holes in the gray blanket and puffy clouds drifted slowly through the sky behind them.
After having enjoyed the view for a couple minutes, Frisbee joined me and then we both moved on, him outpacing me as I continued to try to take it easy. Throughout the morning the trail wound upward, gently enough that it didn't tire my legs, but nonetheless upwards and onto a very windy ridge. I'm no metrologist, but the cold wind seemed a portent of the rain we were expecting in the afternoon and so I picked up the pace, hoping to at least reach the shelter and have some lunch before it started.
I eventually reached the shelter, took a quick PB tortilla lunch with Tarzan, MiddleBrother, Frisbee, BirdPerson, Pigasis, and a few other hikers and was about to keep moving when Lookout and Classy arrived. I waited and chatted while they ate and we decided to head for Kincora hostel instead of the shelter since it was only 2 miles short of the shelter (milage we could make up tomorrow), only required a suggested donation of $5 to stay at, and would keep us dry for the night.
Lookout and I headed out together but I pretty quickly fell behind since the path was mostly downhill, which I was attempting to take slower to preserve my knees. I listen to podcasts throughout the afternoon and I descended from the ridge under the ever-more-threatening clouds. I eventually reached the gap to find Lookout already jumping into a car to get a free ride up to the hostel from a friendly group of day hikers. Though they offered me a ride as well but it was only 0.2mi up to the hostel so I elected to wait for Classy just to make sure we all ended up at the same place. Only a minute or two after Lookout was chauffered away she arrived and so we walked up to the hostel, arriving just as the car that had dropped Lookout off pulled away.
The owner of the hostel wasn't around, so at the behest of the sign and the other hikers already there, we made ourselves at home. The hostel was rustic... the hikers had a building to ourselves which contained 16 bunks spread across 2 floors, a bed, a kitchen, and a living room. Connected by a covered porch was 2 bathrooms, a laundry room, a shower room, and a picnic table to hang out at. The inside of the abode had the studs exposed and in between each of them (throughout the ENTIRE building), were cards and pictures of thru hikers standing on Katahdin which they had sent to thank the hostel owner, Bob Peoples. 
We all availed ourselves of the showers, by which time our host had returned and so we took him up on his offer for a ride into town.  He warned us, but the ride into town was slightly nauseating as we twisted down the 11 switchbacks which brought the one lane road down the several thousand feet of elevation into town.
First stop was a store which had groceries at which I picked up another pound of peanut butter that I'd need for lunches to make it to Damascus. After that we headed over to McDonald's to grab dinner.  They had a make-your-own burger option from which I had a crispy chicken sandwich with guac and pico, fries, a salad, and 2 apple pies. I don't think this is entirely hiker hunger talking, but the Hampton, TN McDonald's is pretty legit... the food was actually good (a word I'm not used to using to describe McDonald's food).
We ate once we got back to the hostel and while eating the power went out (Bob had tripped a breaker while working on getting a light bulb working), but we're used to not having electricity at this point, so we just broke out the headlamps and kept chowing down and chatting.
Classy, Lookout, and I retired to the master suite (named by Lookout since it was the room which had the only bed, but which Classy had passed up since the window wouldn't close) and watched the last hour of Braveheart. After finishing it we hung out for a bit longer with the other hikers before heading to bed.","Mountaineer Shelter
",Kincora Hostel,"May 04, Thu",15.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563291,"This morning Scuttles, a hiker who stayed at the hostel with us, cooked a big skillet of a dozen eggs he had bought last night and some hash browns and was kind enough to share with everyone, so we ate well this morning.
Before we left at all took the opportunity to backflush our water filters, but not much actually came out, which indicates that we've been filtering pretty clean water.
We hit the trail by 830 while the sun worked on burning off the rest of the fog. The trail led us down a steep rocky embankment to the Laurel falls and the Laurel Fork River. The river and falls looked lovely in the morning sun as we hiked along. Eventually though, the trail took an upward turn and we began ascending Pond Flats Mt, the only real mountain we'd see all day. The trail was very well graded and had lots of switchbacks, so we cruised up and down the mountain, eventually reaching Watuga lake. Along the way we ran into Tarzan, which surprised everyone since both parties thought the other was ahead on the trail but both parties  had stayed at (different) hostels last night.
We crossed a road and emerged onto the picnic area at the lake and won the lottery... we had a lake, a picnic table to eat lunch on, working bathrooms, and a water spicot! You can't ask for more than that! (Note: that may sound like sarcasm, but it's actually not... That's better than most lunch spots have). As we were eating the superintendent of this section of trail stopped by to chat and get our opinions of the trail bend before hiking off into the woods to experience it for himself.
After finishing lunch we headed out, cruising around the flat terrain as we circumnavigated the lake. The trail spit us out at Watuga Dam and we crossed the massive earthen barrier which had created the lake. Not quite as interesting as Fontana dam, both since it was smaller and because it had less obvious engineering involved in it's construction, but still a unique landmark.
After the dam we took, what I dubbed, the On Ramp to the Highway to Damascus. The trail for the next 40miles looked very flat according to AWOL, no more than 100-200ft of elevation change at a time... probably a ridge that we'd run all the way there, maybe one of the ones we had seen from the balds a few days earlier. To get there we just had to climb about 1500ft to get onto the ridge. 
Once we topped out the trail got really easy... flat, dirt trail, without too many obstructions. We stopped for a bit to get some water and the rain that we had been expecting all day finally started. We hiked the afternoon away, the rain, wind, and chill keeping conversation down and us moving to stay warm. I was leading and ended up pushing the pace a little much, which I tend to do when I just want to get to a place, especially when it's raining.
We finally reached the shelter, having completed our 24.5mi for the day. There was space in the shelter so the 3 of us piled in and setup camp, listening to the rain on the roof throughout the evening.","Kincora Hostel

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563471,"We woke up to frosty breath on this cold morning and promptly rolled back over and burrowed deeper into our sleeping bags. Last night was a bit cold, I ended up putting on my puffy and pants for some extra warmth since my sleeping bag (which is rated for 20deg, but that's the temp at which it will keep you alive) wasn't quite cutting it. It would've been nice to have had my long johns that I had sent home from Hot Springs, but it wasn't worth carrying them for this one night I would've used them.  Lookout pulled down the weather for the nearest town and they were at 34deg, so it might've even been a bit colder than that since we're higher in the mountains, but our water didn't freeze, so it probably wasn't below 32deg.
We finally roused ourselves from our bags and packed up as quick as possible to get moving before we got too cold. We started hiking at 930 with a long day planned, a marathon would get us to Damascus. It wasn't raining as we started hiking but the trees were still dripping the water they had collected overnight.
A couple miles in, at a road crossing, we came across a pop up tent. Could it be?? It had been so long... TRAIL MAGIC. Indie and Packman were manning a semi-permanent encampment (they planned to hang out for at least another week) and offered us fruit, beer, juice, and snacks. They also fired up their grill and made us bacon and then cooked us some pancakes in the grease. Soooo good. We hung out there and chatted with them for almost 45 min, during which time Tarzan caught up and joined the party. 
Also, I don't think it's going to stick, but Classy suggested changing my name to Dora (as in, the explorer) since I always know where we are and where we're headed since I have AWOL on my phone within easy reach during the day. 
As soon as we started hiking again we found ourselves hiking through a cow pasture. Dodging the pies, we walked right past the grazing caddle as Classy rattled off the names of the colorings of the cows. 
Back into the woods, I stopped to eat a quick lunch while the other two continued on. Not too long after than, we ran into more TRAIL MAGIC at another road. We had just passed FarmGirl and Docks before the road and it turned out that the angels were FarmGirl's parents who had been driving through the area and had been convinced to bring Burger King, beers, and homemade cookies for hikers. We all grabbed a burger and beer and chatted for a little bit until the rain that we had been expecting all day started and kicked us into action. 14mi to town.
The rain quickly escalated and the temperature dropped noticably. We took a couple minutes of rest in a tiny shelter (which had once been an emergency refuge for a fire warden who had manned the top of McQueens Knob) as a couple waves of sleet/hail came through. The shelter roof eminiated alternating heavy ""plunks"" and thousands of pins falling as the rain and sleet hit.
As we continued the weather did as well, but I was actually having a great time. Most of the time hiking is a Man vs Self conflict, to borrow from literary analysis. It's putting up with the aches and pains, ignoring tiredness or coldness after a long day, and still finding the fun in those experiences. But when he weather or terrain turn rediculous, for me the conflict becomes more Man vs Nature. Putting up with whatever nature is throwing at you which would probably stop most people... and I'm up for a challenge.
Eventually the rain subsided as we continued to hike, weary from the many miles already covered. Thankfully the trail down into town was the nicest yet... As an old forest road it was flat, even, and made from soft dirt. We caught sight of buildings only shortly before we emerged from the woods and onto a street. We found some TRAIL MAGIC, clementines in a bag left on the trail for hikers. Classy and I split the penultimate clementine, to leave one for Lookout . We walked into a park which contains the often-photographed arch sign in Damascus and once Lookout arrived we took a tramily photo.
Of course, as soon as we got into town the clouds parted and the sun started shining down on us which just made the feeling of reaching Damascus even better. Earlier in the day I had called Crazy Larry's hostel and gotten a room for the night, so we headed there to freshen up. In case you were curious, heaven is a hot shower with great water pressure, warm clothes straight from dryer, and a reclining chair after 30deg rain all afternoon. 
We headed into town, grabbed some dinner/beer from Bobo's and then headed to bed. All and all, great day. We hiked 27.2mi (more than a marathon) in suboptimal weather conditions. We were joking that we did the easiest section of trail we've yet hiked in hardest way possible, in 2 very long days in not great weather. We could've taken them slower, we know many people who are, but it does feel good to be in town and we've earned the two zeros we're going to take. Also, it's a pretty good day when you could've eaten all your meals from trail magic.
We've been seeing some pics from various social media... The Smokies got 6in of snow from this storm and Tex and NotBad (among others) had snow and 80mph winds going over Roan Mt, so many people were hiking through worse conditions than us today. Hopefully spring kicks back in soon.","Iron Mountain Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563789,"Zero day!
We had breakfast at Crazy Larry's, which he prepares for his guests, consisting of eggs, sausage, and big, thick chocolate chip pancakes before moving our gear from the cabin over to the bunkhouse, where we'd be sleeping tonight.
After breakfast we headed out on the town, heading over to the outfitter to look around. I picked up my package, which contained some goodies from friends at home. This time I got chocolate bread, cider, whiskey, and postcards! In addition, I also got my resupply items I requested... more toothpaste, hand sanitizer, earplugs, a converter cable so yay I can use headphones with my phone, and my quilt (which is about a pound lighter than my sleeping bag and should keep me warm enough now that (hopefully) the cold weather is behind us).
After dropping our packages back at the hostel, we all headed over to Mojo's, a local cafe, for some good food. We hung out there for a while, caught up on the internet, and did a bit of planning for the next couple days. It's been a long time since our last zero and I'm on schedule, so we're going to double zero (today and tomorrow) and bike the Virginia creeper trail tomorrow. After Mojo's I picked up another smartwater bottle to replace my platypus. The platypus, while slightly lighter and smaller than a water bottle, is getting dingy and is hard to clean, so I'm replacing it with the bottle because I can replace the bottle on trail easily when I need to... A small optimization that makes sense on a trip of this scale but didn't necessarily before.
We spent most of the afternoon hanging with BirdPerson, Goose, Tarzan, and Pigasis, who are all staying at the hostel for the night. Bird brought beer leftover from a family wedding, so we drank for a bit before heading over to the local brewery. On the way over we realized that it had closed, but we did get TRAIL MAGIC on the street from some guys who gave us each a beer (technically the street through town is the trail, so it counts).
We ended up having dinner at BoBos again, heading back to hostel, and then drinking around a campfire that Larry made us.","Damascus

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563790,"Second zero day!
We grabbed breakfast at Mojo's before Classy, I Tarzan, Bird, Pigasis, and Goose headed over to the outfitter. In addition to the AT, the Virgina Creeper trail also runs through Damascus and is a very popular bike route. It's a rails-to-trail conversion, so the terrain is very tame and scenic. We got our bikes and hopped in the van for the shuttle to the top (it's our day off... we are not doing anything that involves going up a hill).
At the top we hopped onto the trail at the old Whitetop train station and started riding. As we started the air and the wind generated by the movement of the bike had a bite to it, but the sun went a long way towards dispelling it. The trail was great... a peddle or two let us coast for minutes at a time. We stopped at a playground we found along the way so that Bird and Pig could swing and the rest of us took a short nap in the sun while they played. Tarzan, Classy, and I enjoyed a 6in apple pie that someone had left in the hiker box (best hiker box find yet... Who leaves a whole, unopened pie?!?!) as a snack. 
After a while we all remounted our bikes but the rest of the group outpaced Classy and I when we stopped to read the informational signs. Not long after the start of the trail it started paralleling a river, so we also stopped to admire some the prettier waterfalls. The water was crystal clear and cascaded over the ledges into large pools cut into the stone. Mid summer these would be ideal swimming holes... Perhaps another adventure.
We coasted down the 18mi of creeper back to Damascus over a couple hours, meeting the AT 3 times along the route and getting a preview of what we'd be hiking. We met back up with Lookout (who hadn't come because he'd strained a muscle yesterday) and grabbed lunch at Mojo's. This being our 3rd time there, they had learned my name... probably means it's time to move on.
Classy and I headed over to the library so that she could take care of some digital business while I did a bit of research on trail days, a huge hiker festival that we'd be back to Damascus for in about 2 weeks. After that we stopped by Food Lion and I bought my resupply (I only spent $5 on a pack of tortillas and a box of granola bars for my next 5 days of food... the rest came from the hiker box) and at picked up some things to make dinner back at Larry's.
On our way back to the hostel we stopped by one of the outfitter's and ran into LeftFoot, a section hiker who had had to get off trail in Hot Springs to go graduate from medical school. She had driven down for the weekend to hang out, so it was really cool and unexpected to see her.
Classy and I headed back to the hostel to make some dinner. It's not often we have access to a food store and a kitchen and we had already eaten at Bobo's 3 times (which we felt was enough), so we (and by that I mean entirely Classy) decided to make something a bit fancy. I assisted her in making bruschetta with a lentle/bean/olive salad side. So good :) We ended up with extra, so Larry and LeftFoot (who stopped by) helped polish it off for us.
After dinner I chatted with Kramers, a triple crowner (ie, he's hiked the AT, PCT, and CDT) who was at the hostel as a bike packer on route 76, which stretches from the east coast to the west coast of the US. He showed us his rig... he's got his bike outfitted to carry his full camping gear and each day rides ~60mi along the route and either stays in a hostel, hotel, or camps. It's going to take him ~2.5mo to make it across the country... pretty cool way to see the country after having seen as much as he has on the trails.
We hung out for the rest of the night around the campfire and then headed to bed.","Damascus

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564018,"We had breakfast at Larry's again this morning, this time biscuits and gravy. Mmmmm mmmm. Tattoo showed up at the hostel and Larry offered her breakfast in exchange for doing the dishes, a deal she promptly accepted. She calls our tramily ""The Flash"" because we always shoot past her pretty quickly while hiking. She was making fun of us a bit... she keeps expecting us to pass her and for her to never see us again but she keeps catching up. Just goes to show, slow and steady gets you to the same place as hiking fast.
We hung around the hostel most of the morning... It was raining pretty hard and consistently and hiking IN rain is one thing, but hiking INTO rain is something that we just couldn't get up the motivation to do this morning. Lookout got his resupply figured out, Classy arranged her transportation back to the real world after trail days, and I journaled (I'm perpetually 2 days behind, usually more when a town is involved). 
Around 1130 the rain abated and we took advantage and hit the trail. The AT followed the creeper out of town but then promptly diverged from the nice, flat creeper and headed straight up a mountain. We climbed said mountain, climbed down said mountain, rejoined the creeper trail for another short section, and then split off again to climb another, steeper mountain. Some people suggest just blue blazing the creeper trail because it's flatter and the river is more scenic, but we stuck with the AT because Classy and I had just biked the creeper yesterday. 
Anyways, the creeper trail had a bathroom (with TP provided!) just before the AT split off again, luxury! Some unfortunate hiker had forgotten their TP in the bathroom... Not a good piece of gear to forget.
Up and up we went and eventually we reached the shelter at around 3pm. The shelter had a lot of grassy flat space around it which would make it nice for tenting, but we elected to use the shelter because of the chance of rain tonight. Thankfully, the forecast for the next couple days seems to be improving, so we may not get as wet as we thought.
We had just finished dinner when we noticed some rather dark and ominous clouds from what we could see of the sky through the trees. Sure enough, a couple minutes later, the first rumble of thunder echoed through the mountains and a few fat drops of rain fell. The rain fell hard as we watched the storm roll through from our sleeping bags nestled in the shelter. We watched as the sky lightened, returning to cheery white clouds, in the wake of the storm.
We had the shelter to ourselves so we watched the first half of the Fellowship of the Ring before getting too tired to continue. Tonight is my first night on trail in my quilt, so we'll see how it goes!","Damascus
",Saunders Shelter,"May 09, Tue",8.40
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564019,"We woke to a great morning, the sun shining into the shelter from between a couple bands of receding clouds. The rain had come and go overnight, keeping things damp, but we were nice and dry in the shelter. 
My quilt performed nicely, keeping me plenty warm. It's also reeaaally nice that it's a full 2lbs lighter than my sleeping bag (sleeping bag is 3.1lbs (I know, I need a lighter cold-weather bag) whereas the quilt is only 1.1lbs), so I just dropped 10% of my base weight, which makes my pack noticably lighter. 
I started a few minutes ahead of Classy and Lookout and within the first couple miles ran into a huge group of young kids. I eventually ran into the teacher who explained that they were a school group and had camped at the next shelter last night. Apparently he had gotten them up at 430 and they had hit the trail at 530 and had already done 4mi so far... slave-driver :p
As I hiked along a wooded ridge I could make out the flanks of Whitetop Mt rising from among the other peaks. Tracing upwards, the slopes of the mountains faded into the color of the clouds. We'd be heading up there and then onto Mt Rodgers, the highest point in VA later today.
The trail was a bit muddy in places and all the streams were running strongly from last nights thunderstorm, which made the going a bit interesting, requiring a bit of trail dancing to stay dry.
The AT rejoined the creeper trail for a final time and gracefully climbed up hill for about a mile before crossing an old railroad tressel over a racing river. After ducking back into the woods I ran into OneGallon and Blaze and chatted for a few minutes. Classy caught up and we headed up Lost Mountain (or so I assumed, since it had lost mountain shelter on it) and we chatted along the way. OneGallon recommended the book Lost on the AT, which I might check out next time I get a chance.
I took elevensies once we reached the shelter and ate half my lunch, which I've been needing to do to sate my hunger more often. A couple more miles up trail we ran into a quote scrawled on a sign post: ""It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to. -Bilbo Baggins"", very appropriate considering last night's entertainment.
A long uphill climb through a rainbow of wildflowers and mountain meadows brought us to buzzard rocks, a rocky outcrop as near the summit of Whitetop as we'd reach which offered great views of the surrounding landscapes. I took second lunch here while taking in the view with Classy, Sandals, and JimmyChonga. We could see the north end of the Highway to Damascus, the ridge we had run to get to town, fading off into the haze and watched as crows and hawks alike soared in the thermals.
I left a bit later than the rest and tried to listen to music (I do really want listen to things now that I have a working headphone adaptor from my resupply box in Damascus), but the weather was just too gorgeous and the music was detracting from my enjoyment of the day, so I put it away and kept cruising. As I rounded Whitetop, Mt Rodgers came into view, spruce cloaked with high fields surrounding the forest. 
Right before hitting a road I passed a sizeable maple sap collecting network... I didn't realize they did that this far south, but I suppose the altitude helps make it more like a northern biome. At the road I ran into a bit of TRAIL MAGIC in the form of a cold bottle of water from some day hikers just finishing their adventure for the day and found a trash can which allowed me to offload what I had generated over the past day and a half.
The ascent up Rodgers was similarly beautiful as the muddy path I followed wove through the multitude of colorful flowers and green flora decorating the ground. The trail skimmed the edge of a field which adorned the saddle between two peaks and just over the hill I spotted something. PONIES! Classy joined and we took the side trail over to where we could get a good look at them. 
We kept our distance since they were off trail and we didn't want to encroach on them and their lunch and snapped a long distance picture before heading back to the AT and continuing on. It wasn't long until we reached our home for the night, Thomas Knob Shelter, and found 4 ponies and 2 fouls  standing right in front of it, licking hikers (presumably for the salt). 
I got my leg cleaning (which wasn't really voluntary... Their necks are pretty long and reach a fair distance into the shelter) before claiming my spot and setting up my bed for the night. I elected to go tag the top of Mt Rogers, the highest point in VA, which wasn't on trail but was only 0.5mi away. The summit was completely tree covered, offering no view of the surroundings, and marked only by the survey marker (and the lack of anything uphill of it), but the spruce forest was picturesk with the green moss growing over everything in sight.
I basically ran back to the shelter, feeling like I was flying going downhill without a pack on. While I was gone the ponies had gotten hungry and headed out into the grass to eat their dinner, leaving us a bit of peace. Most everyone was working on their dinners, so I joined them, cooking and eating on the rocky ledge behind the shelter which overlooked the terrain. I watched as the sun set behind Rodgers, the colors crept into and faded from the sky, the stars appeared, and a HUGE full moon rose before heading to bed.","Saunders Shelter
",Thomas Knob Shelter,"May 10, Wed",18.80
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564207,"We woke up to swirling mists outside the door of the shelter. Just as we headed out the ponies returned to say good morning (and probably try to steal some breakfast).
For the first couple miles we hiked through the fog, which was being blown around by the high winds. The trail was rocky and led through the barren looking landscape of the highlands, the grasslands dotted with only a few small bushes and rocky outcrops. We passed through the Fat Man's Squeeze (a short rock tunnel) that required a bit of maneuvering to navigate and continued to hike through the clouds.
We started to descend, passing through the bottom of the clouds as Grayson Highlands State Park came into view. We entered the park, spotting another herd of wild ponies grazing in the distance. Just a little way into the park we hit another landmark, 500mi! Makin progress!
I climbed up a rocky outcrop to take in the sights and was almost blown off of it by the high winds. The ridge we were hiking on was surrounded by a bowl, Mount Rodgers and the highlands we had just traversed behind, a wooded valley below and surrounded by more highland peaks in the distance.
We descended into the forest and came upon the shelter, where I had elevensies and the others, including Jewels and ShortStep, had a snack. A slackpacker rolled up to the shelter and said ""I'm grateful"". We waited expectantly for him to finish his statement, but after a few moments he asked us to tell him our names in return... he has a confusing trail name. 
We headed out again and ended up taking a wrong turn (or rather, not taking a turn) and hiking on. Navigating the AT is pretty easy, white blazes mark the trail, but it's been traveled by so many people by this time in the year that the trail is blatantly obvious. The only spot you sometimes have to watch out for is intersections with other trails, but other than that I pretty much run on autopilot. I was in the lead at this point, and  after a few minutes my subconscious raised the alarm and I realized we hadn't seen a blaze in a couple minutes. We didn't see any back blazes either, so we turned back until we found the last blaze we had passed. We had followed a well defined forest road and missed a tiny turnoff into a rhotodendron thicket where we should've gone. The trail club which maintains this section only uses double blazes (which indicates the trail is about to do something squirrelly, but not what) instead of knock over blazes (a double blaze tilted to indicate what direction the trail goes), which would've been helpful here. Anyways, no big deal, the whole misadventure only cost about 10min and we were back on trail. 
We walked along a ridge and had a great view of Rogers and the highlands in the, now beautiful, weather. We hiked down into The Scales, an area where farmers used to weigh the caddle the grazed the highlands, and found TRAIL MAGIC from two guys who lived in the area and were giving hikers water (on a normally dry section of trail).
Not too long after we left Grayson Highlands State Park (which is actually only 3mi of trail) and started descending back down into the lowlands. We walked across and underground river that we could hear gurgling underneath the rocks and moss and then cruised for the rest of the afternoon. 
We reached Hurricane Mt shelter at about 4pm and had dinner and were finishing the Fellowship of the Ring when a couple more  people rolled in. Tattoo caught us again, and by the end of the evening we ended up with a full shelter, since rain is expected tonight.
Though the rain had already started, the sun still colored the western sky as it set and lights appeared throughout the valley, probably surrounding I-81 which is to our Northwest.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564389,"We had agreed to get an early start today, wanting to get to partnership shelter as early as possible to avoid as much rain as we could. We got up at 6 and I was packed and fed by 630 so I hit the trail a little ahead of Classy and Lookout. It was only drizzling a little as I started which continued as I hiked.
A couple places had some sparse blazing, but no wrong turns today, thankfully. I stopped by a waterfall, which had a conviennent tree-seat, to do some preventative taping of my foot, which was already wet and had developed some hotspots from the aggressive pace.
I hiked through a tunnel of rhotodendrons so thick that the ground underneath had yet to be touched by the rain, crossed a road, and blazed up a gradual hill before reaching a ridge. From the top I could see bright white fog clinging to the valley floor, the looming form of a mountain behind it, and light gray clouds above completing the sandwich.
By this time the rain had picked up and as I hiked its gentle patter was punctuated by bigger drops falling from the trees. I passed ImGrateful, hiking south for the day, and be offered that I could slackpack with him next week if I wanted since his buddy was taking a week off and ImGrateful needed someone to run the other half of his continuous shuttle. I politely refused since slackpacking isn't my thing, and continued on.
I hit Trimpi shelter not too long afterwards, and had elevensies (even though it was only 930). As I left Trimpi I realized that though I had consulted AWOL on the milage left for the day, I hadn't even bothered to look at the terrain because it didn't really matter... knowing a hill is coming doesn't make it any easier and I'm pretty well adapted to hiking at this point such that the hills aren't bad anyways. Kinda a cool realization.
At the shelter, I ate just about the last of my food (and wasn't carrying much water since it was so cool and rainy), which meant that as I got moving again my pack was just about 17lbs, which felt great.
I passed SuperBoring, Skillz, and UnoSocko as well as some weekenders (I could smell their soap from several yards away) as I hiked. I got to play Slip-n-slide in a muddy field... these shoes have by far the worst mud traction of any I've ever hiked in, so it makes any sort of muddy hill interesting. Also, at this point I've added several extra ventilation holes in the shoes since I've started... they just have to survive another 100mi until I get my next resupply box but even that might be cutting it close.
The rest of the morning passed quickly and the trail wasn't too difficult as it followed a soft ridge and soon enough I pulled into partnership shelter, having competed 19.0mi in 5.5hr and finishing my hiking for the day by noon. The conditions were just right today to allow for such as aggressive pace, cloudy and cool to help me not overheat but not too rainy to make the footing treacherous.
Partnership shelter is well known because it's only 0.2mi from a road and so you can order pizza to it. Our plan was to duck into Marion, resupply with enough food to reach Perisburg, and then stay at the shelter tonight and order a pizza (which saves us money from staying in town). Since I didn't expect Lookout and Classy to arrive for a bit longer, I decided to try to hitch into town to get some food, but as soon as I reached the road it started to downpour, so I decided to just wait for the shuttle bus that would arrive in an hour under the safety of a roof.
Once Lookout and Classy arrived it was mutually decided that coming back out of town today wasn't going to happen, so we caught the shuttle into Marion, got food at McDonald's (Lookout had a total of 6 burgers... talk about hiker hunger), resupplied at Walmart/Ingles, and headed down to the Travelers Inn for the night. We all grabbed hot showers (particularly nice after a cool rainy day), and then went out for Mexican food at Mi Puerto. We capped the night off by watching the National Geographic documentary on the AT (pretty funny to see their take on the trail from our point of view) and then started watched a bit of the Two Towers before falling asleep.","Hurricane Mt Shelter
",Marion,"May 12, Fri",19.20
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564636,"We took breakfast in bed this morning, finishing off the snacks and fruit we had bought yesterday that was too heavy or bulky to pack out. Classy turned on HGTV and Fixer Upper was on all morning as we slowly showered and packed up. We had to call for a taxi back to the trail since the public transit we had taken down only runs on weekdays (and Marion isn't large enough to have Uber) and met it at McDonald's after grabbing coffee (for Classy) and second breakfast (for me).
The cab pulled up and the driver helped us load our gear into the trunk (which had to be held open to prevent it from slamming shut). On the way up he pointed out the holes in the floor from the cage which had been installed when this car was a cop car, and laughed about how water would spurt up through them when he drove through deep puddles. After we passed his boss's house he sped up and we rocketed up the mountain... maybe next time we'll hitch...
When we got back to the Mt Rogers visitors center we found Tarzan and Pig, having just arrived and heading into town. We headed out, back on the trail, and the sky transformed from the gray blanket of clouds into a bright sunny day throughout our first hour of hiking. We got a view along the ridge (not very common... mostly they're covered in trees) and observed trucks running along I-81 in the valley below and the landscape organizing itself into ridges, which is characteristic of hiking in VA.
On our way down into the valley the trail hoped back and forth across a stream a bunch of times. Several of the crossings had no dry way across with the water as high as it was, so those new drainage holes I had made in my shoes were helpful. At the bottom we came upon an old one-room school house with TRAIL MAGIC! The local Methodist Church stocked the school house with all sorts of toiletries, snacks, fruits, and drinks. I picked up some toothpaste, a new toothbrush, a pen, and some snacks. We sat on the porch for a bit and enjoyed the treats and the beautiful day with a bunch of other hikers.
As we left the school we passed a SOBO who informed us that we were the 100th NOBOs he had seen today. He was moving south, which means he'll run into more hikers than would pass a stationary point (like the entrance to the Smokies), but still shows that there are a lot of people out here.
We traversed a grassy field littered with wildflowers, mostly yellow buttercups and small white flowers, before heading back into the woods. The hike down into Atkins was very pleasant, gentle downhill, over the train tracks, past the llama farm, the buzz of the highway getting louder with each step. I practiced a bit of my new favorite sport, mud skiing (Lookout later noted that I'm much better than I used to be) before the terrain flattened out and we trudged through a muddy, boggy area before reaching the road. Classy picked up her bounce bounce box and resupplied before we continued on about another 100ft before hitting TRAIL MAGIC.
Tim, Lucky's father, had was doing some magic for his son and fellow hikers as they passed through the area. He had beer, boxes upon boxes of Jimmy John's sandwiches, snacks, and fruit, probably in quantity enough to feed all 100 hikers that had passed through here today. As we enjoyed our treats from the parking lot of the gas station across the street from the trail, we saw another hiker, Catnis, and waved her over. She was listening to music and apparently in the zone because she didn't notice the waving, the whistling, the yelling until someone ran over and tapped her on the shoulder and pointed at the magic.
The three of us had planned to stop at a restaurant called The Barn to get a burger (we had just resupplied and didn't need the food, but burger...) but thanks to the magic we didn't even have room for a burger anymore. We crossed under I-81 and crossed a couple more fields and wooded patches before ducking back into the woods and reaching our campsite... well, the campsite we made the snap decision to stay at tonight. We were originally planning to go another 2mi but decided that this campsite with water and no privy was better than the campsite with privy and no water and that we'd just make up the 2mi tomorrow.
The campsite was crowded, everyone at the trail magic hung out there for long enough that this was basically their only camping option and we ended up with ~30 tents in the area. There were tents pitched on both sides of the AT and each decided to make a campfire. BaberahamLincoln caught Scout stealing some of our hard earned firewood and declared war on other campfire, breaking his trekking pole in his enthusiastic address to rally the northern camp.
I end up going out to the field that started about a 100ft from our campsite and watched the stars come out until about 11pm, catching a few more satellites and shooting stars while I was out there. When I headed to bed the fires were still going strong, manned by a few night owls, and our camp's fire projected a dull red light into my tent as I drifted off.","Marion
",Davis Hollow,"May 13, Sat",13.70
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564638,"I woke up early this morning, a little chilly while we waited for the sun to reach our corner of the Earth. I'm still working on figuring out thermal mangement with the quilt... I woke up drenched in sweat at one point in the night and then chilly in the morning. Its very adjustable, I've just got to figure out how it works best in various temperature conditions. I also woke up to some coyotes which were yipping up in the hills, but they didn't come into camp.
I headed out at 7am, the first one out of camp as evidenced by the cobwebs clearing I was doing. I very much enjoy morning hiking, it was cool, sunny, and a light breeze had just started stirring the trees. I could see ridges in the distance, including the one we had hiked on yesterday, but couldn't get any pics because I was only catching glimpses through the thick trees which covered the tops of my ridge.
I passed a troop of boy scouts on the side of the trail making breakfast and continued walking. Going downhill hurts my knees a bit, which is because my pack is too heavy (I'm not sure I'm going to carry 5 days of food again if I can help it... I think it's worth ducking into an extra town to avoid the joint damage that an over-heavy pack causes).
I passed a campsite with everyone eating breakfast and headed up and over a ridge. On the way down I passed and chatted with Beaver and BackwoodsBarbie, an older couple from KY section hiking for 8 days.
After leaving them behind I came to a wall across the trail... a tree had fallen and was entirely blocking the trail. Pricker bushes prevented simply walking around and so the only option was to shimmy through between 2 of the branches. I didn't want to take my pack off and so went for it and got a bit stuck, but managed to slip though before anyone else came along and decided that that should be a trail name. Always an adventure!
As I hiked the terrain flattened out and little while petals drifted down from the trees to the ground like summer snow. The trail followed a thin strip of forest which seperated two large rolling fields which stood to each side. The eastern one had a white farm house tucked into it with a tall brown silo adjoining it, topped with a gleaming silver dome. Every horizon had a ridge which dissapeared into the distance and not a cloud was visible in the sky. It doesn't get better than this.
The trail crossed the fields and headed uphill before turning halfway up the hilly field. Turning back, the ridge formed a green wall protecting this secluded valley from the rest of the world and echoed back anything shouted at it.  Through a forest and over a bridge (to grandmother's...) the trail wound through the rural countryside, a nice change from the high mountains and ridges we normally follows. The bridge didn't have enough clearance for the volume of water carried by the river and was acting as a dam which had evidence of a recent spillover. I walked past an empty pavilion (which we'd later learn had trail magic... a make your own taco setup, just an hour after I passed it) and back uphill brought me to a shelter, where I had lunch and took a short nap until Classy and Lookout arrived.
We hiked on and reached our final challenge for the day, a 2000ft climb up Chestnut Knob. It was a rather brutal slog upwards with our heavy packs and the weather as hot as it was. For whatever reason, perhaps calorie deficit, electrolyte deficiency, dehydration, or overheating, I just felt like I had no energy. To top it off, AWOL listed the spring at the shelter as unreliable, so we had to tank up and carry 3L of water, an extra 6.6lbs, 1.5mi to the shelter. My pack (ULA Circuit) is only comfy carrying less than ~30lbs and the extra water weight combined with the food I was carrying definitely exceeded that.
The top of the mountain was bald, so we made our way through the sunny fields until we finally arrived at the shelter. This shelter, an old fire warden's cabin, was unique in that it was fully enclosed (4 walls!) and had a door (which we had never seen in the wild before!). The structure sat in the middle of a meadow and a group of colorful tents were visible in the woods on the far side. The meadow sloped over the edge of the mountain and from this vantage point the whole of the valley below was visible.
We cooked inside the shelter to get out of the wind, but took our dinners out to admire the view as we ate. We watched a bit more of the Two Towers until just before sunset, when we returned to the view to watch as the valley below and the sky above faded to night. Classy and I stargazed for a while, wrapped in sleeping bags against the chilly wind.","Davis Hollow

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564801,"Classy and I rose early, at 545 before the sunrise, and returned to our stargazing positions, armed with sleeping bags and breakfast fixings, to watch it return to the sky (or rather, watch the Earth turn under us and face the sun). 
First, the commercial airlines flying high above the Earth started reflecting the sun's rays as they experienced their early sunrise. Then the sun rose above the horizon, deep red, dimmed as it's light passed through the atmosphere, and mostly obscured by clouds on the horizon. We could only see strips of it through the clouds, sometimes an edge or two from which you could guess (based on the curvature) how far the sun has risen. A few minutes after the show began, it ended as the sun slipped behind another set of clouds and out of sight before it started rising AGAIN from behind the clouds. We watched it rise until it was too bright to look at, two sunrises for the price of one this morning!
I hit the trail as soon as I finished packing, descending off the knob and onto a ridge. The ridge extended 10mi around the valley, but offered no clear views without trees along the way. I passed a road through a gap that we would later learn would have trail magic (beer, chips and dips) a couple hours later... I've got to stop getting up so early.
After a couple more hours of hiking I arrived at a shelter, tucked into the valley between the ridge we just walked and the one we'd take this afternoon. I had elevensies with a group of hikers who had hiked past Chestnut Knob yesterday. After lunch I did a bit of stream laundry (a couple warm days of sweating will make clothes pretty ripe), hung them to dry in the sun on my bearline-turned-clothesline, and took a nap in the shade of the shelter as the lunch crew moved on. An hour later the hikers from Chestnut Knob started rolling in for lunch which I also joined them in. My clothes now dry and my siesta over, I packed up and hit the trail. 
Of course, not 5min into the uphill I was sweating again, but what can you do? The trail topped the ridge and joined an old forest road which was super flat and had easy footing, which made the hiking easy. About 5mi later the trail ducked down into another valley, but this time it contained our home for the night. With no shelter within easy reach we had decided to camp by Laurel Creek for the night. After Classy and Lookout arrived and we all made the decision that we were done for the day with went about setting up camp as more people rolled in.
I had a terrible time hanging my bear line... I got my rope such in a vine and had to cut ~10ft of it off to recover the rest, I had the bag flip over a branch and come back at me, I got it stuck again and had to climb an adjacent tree to get it back (getting a little cut on my head in the process). Everyone has off days I suppose.
Everyone at camp that night used the large creek for a quick river shower (the water is cold!). The river cascaded over a series of small rocky ledges that created a number of pools perfect for standing in as everyone washed their gear and selves.
After dinner We finished the Two Towers and then chatted for a while with StinkyCheese (who seems to always carry a huge block of cheese to add to meals) before heading to bed.","Chestnut Knob Shelter
",Laurel Creek,"May 15, Mon",15.10
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565409,"I took it easy getting up this morning (lesson learned from all the missed trail magic), listening to some music for a little while before finally working up the energy to move. I still hit the trail by 8 and the hiking was easy. We had a moderate uphill followed by a long flat/downhill section this morning, but the sun hadn't yet touched the trail as I hiked which kept the temperatures pleasantly cool.
I passed Hinds, Vince, and Nobody and took over cobweb duty for the rest of the morning. I reached a gravel road and followed it down the hill past some heavy machinery installing a new set of high voltage power lines. 
Coming down to a road, I ran into some TRAIL MAGIC. Someone had left a grocery bag on a sign from which i grabbed a banana and cereal packet. Then, I got some TRAIL MAGIC from a white sedan than pulled up just as I reached the road. An older gentleman got out, handed me 2 bags with 4 candy bars each (Butterfingers, almond joy, Snickers) and a clementine each and then pulled away. My parents warned me about strangers handing out candy from a white van, but they didn't say anything about white sedans! I'm not sure why they stopped, but I think I was the only hiker to get that magic, which is pretty cool.
I walked a bit farther and sat on a shady ledge overlooking I-77 below and ate some of my newly acquired food while I waited for the others. I noticed a couple people come out of the woods but not continue hiking past me, which was suspicious. I headed back to check it out and found TRAIL MAGIC from a 4time AT thru hiker from Alabama who is up here for trail days and doing some trail magic until it starts. I got a banana from him and also noticed the store that I had walked past. It wasn't fully open yet, the owner only had permission to sell prepackaged goods until the permits were worked out, but I enjoyed 2 drumsticks (ice cream) from the store (I had to get 2 otherwise I would've gotten change back, and change is heavy...) which were appreciated as the temperature continued to climb towards the 80s.
While we were enjoying our treats one of the helicopters we had heard throughout the morning topped the hill we had just come down and hovered there. A could seconds later a heavy lift helicopter dangling a sling joined the smaller spotter copter and began to hover. As we watched the helicopter lumbered back into the sky trailing half of a high voltage transmission line underneath it. It made this run twice while we stood and watched before moving on.
We crossed I-77 on an overpass and did the truck dance and had a couple of drivers give us a honk in return. The trail continued rien the road a bit farther before ducking back into the woods but not before passing a trash can with a sign requesting that no deer carcasses be placed in it (how many times did that take have to happen before a sign had to be put up?). We headed uphill, a sweaty ordeal even with the trees providing protection from the sun, and as we rounded a small ridge the sounds of the highway abruptly disappeared returning us to nature.
We headed 0.3 off trail to a shelter and had some lunch. We had tanked up at the store because in addition to the 0.3 we had already walked, the water for the shelter was another 0.3 onwards, making it a 1.2mi round trip to get water here, the last reliable water for the next 10mi.
Lookout remained at the shelter a bit longer to finish his siesta, so Classy and I headed out, doing a hiking sing-along to a Spotify Disney playlist. We've done it before but hiking, singing, and breathing (a requirement for the two former) are impossible to do simultaneously if the hiking involves any sort of uphill. 
6mi into the dry stretch we were both running low on water (I'll need to start filling both bottles on days like these) in the blazing hot afternoon when we came to a gap and hit some TRAIL MAGIC. RonJon, a thru hiker last year, was parked in the gap, camping in the back of his truck for the week (waiting for trail days) handing out water and snacks to this year's hikers. The water was greatly appreciated and made the next couple miles a lot more pleasant.
Throughout the day we stepped over 3 sets of bear scat on the trail but didn't run into any. 2mi before camp we hit another milestone... 600mi! There was no sign or anything this time (or we missed it), but still pretty satisfying. 
At camp I soaked my feet downstream of the water source and most of us took bandana showers in the stream to take a bit of the sweat off. We all cooked dinner and halfway through cooking my pasta dish I ran out of fuel. This can lasted me from Hot Springs to here, more than 300mi, which is pretty good. I borrowed some fuel from Classy (and her massive fuel can)) to finish my meal and enjoyed my Dirty Rice in tortilla.
Tomorrow is my last day hiking in these shoes, which is probably good. It doesn't look like it would take too much to rip the toes off of them at this point. Also, we're going to do some night hiking tomorrow morning while we still have a bit of moon left and to avoid some of the heat of the day. Should be fun!","Laurel Creek
",Jenny Knob Shelter,"May 16, Tue",18.80
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565410,"My alarm went off at 330. Ugggg. It didn't feel like I got much sleep last night since I was still pretty tired. Though I really didn't want to move, I could see the moon rising into the sky through the trees from my tent so the timing was perfect. We wouldn't have another chance until the next lunar cycle (in about 2 weeks) and so this was our last chance to do it while we still have Classy.
The night was warm... The predicted low was 58degF and I had gone to bed with only my liner on, not even using my quilt, though I did have to pull it on around midnight because I was just a couple degrees too cold.
Even low on the horizon, the moonlight was enough for me to pack up my gear by without my headlamp. I had my cold oatmeal... None of us were cooking right now to save time, and we hit the trail at 410.
To Classy's protest, we started out without headlamps, just the half moon lighting the world around us. Half a moon in a fairly dense forest wasn't quite enough light to actually see anything distinct with, but between that and some feeling around (ie, if there are bushes in front of you, it's not the trail), I was able to navigate.
Not long after we left camp we scared off a couple deer that were hanging out near the trail. Classy was definitely having some type 2 fun as we descended into a valley which blocked direct view of the moon and ended up turning on her headlamp. We eventually crossed a road and had to retreat into the woods once to avoid a lone car that we were concerned might not see us in the dark. We headed up a hill, the moon now working in our favor and lighting the hillside, but we had to keep the headlamp on because of the degredation of our night vision from it's initial use. We emerged into a high voltage power line clearing and we stopped for a few minutes to admire the stars and have a quick snack break. As we stood there, even for such a short time, we observed the horizon lighten a bit and the dimmer stars disappear from the brightening sky.
We continued onto the ridge as the sky continued to lighten, first the lighter-colored rocks become visible in the pre-dawn light, then the roots, and finally the ground itself. We descended as the sun rose and then peaked over the horizon, coloring the clouds, the sky, and the light mist clinging to the valleys a light peach color.
As we walked through the dewey fields cows serenaded us in the distance. The field smelled like a subtler form of fresh cut grass with a hint of sweetness from the wildflowers which dotted the fields.
Bridge across river, road, uphill, downhill, Dismal Falls! Dismal Falls is, in my opinion, poorly named as it's actually quite lovely, especially in the early morning sunlight. We stopped, broke out our stoves, and cooked and ate breakfast while enjoying the falls. 
I left a bit earlier than the other two and so cruised for the rest of the morning. The trail followed a valley as it gently sloped upwards to meet the ridges on either side and passed through lush forest and crossed over many streams. 
Eventually I reached Wapiti shelter and stopped for elevensies with a couple other people. OldSoul and I chatted about our plans for getting to trail days and Antenna (who has the same gaiters as I do... Maybe I wasn't very unique in my accessorization...) and PapaG came in and hung out for a while.
Our tramily regrouped, we headed out for our big hill of the day. I turned on some upbeat music and crushed it, stopping for a view of Perisburg at the top. Though not terribly difficult, the hill had gotten me quite warm, so I ditched the shirt for a few minutes (but not too long, not long enough to burn... well, not too much) while I took in the sights. 
Lookout had gone ahead after the view, so Classy and I hiked the next couple miles, talking about the apartments options she was deciding between. We took a side trail out to a large array of towers and antennae which overlooked a cliff and the ridges, valleys, forests, and towns below. This spot also had an awesome grassy field in front of the towers which would be a great campsite.
Tired and hot, we headed down to Woods Hole Hostel. We turned off trail and followed a forest road a half mile down to the edge of the national forest and to our home for the night. A working sustainable farm, we walked in past a pig enclosure, a vegetable garden, a wood burning furnace, and checked in for the night. We got the upstairs of the bunkhouse (which has the better mattresses) and took our showers, donned loaner clothes, and gathered our laundry.
One of the hikers ran a yoga class... yoga is super hard! I don't use most of those muscles! Though tough, it left my tired and sore muscles feeling much better. I spent most of the rest of the afternoon on their porch hammock, relaxing and journaling until the dinner bell rang.
Dinner was amazing, fresh baked bread with homemade butter and pesto, a salad picked from the vegetable garden with homemade ranch dressing, rice, curried lentils, pork stew from a pig slaughtered last week, and green beans.  And to top it off, homemade strawberry and peach ice cream. Best meal on the trail so far.
We headed to bed full and content. We heard from talking to Vince and Nobody that we're a bit trail famous... apparently everyone on the first couple miles of trail heard us go by this morning. We were quiet when we saw tents, but a couple people had camped far enough off trail that we didn't see them but still within earshot. Whoops!","Jenny Knob Shelter
",Woods Hole,"May 17, Wed",21.70
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565411,"Woods Hole has their guests help out with some chores around the hostel and my job for the morning was to collect the dirty towels from the shower area and bring them to the laundry. DoubleBarrel (one of the people doing work-for-stay) ended up doing my job for me, which freed me of my responsibility for the morning, which was nice. When they serve the morning coffee they also put out a laundry basket of towels with a sign ""If you're bored, fold me!"" for hikers to help them in their downtime. Since my job had been done for me, I decided I was bored.
Breakfast this morning rivaled dinner... farm eggs and cheese, farm sausage, peach cobbler, oranges, fresh bread, homemade butter, apple butter, strawberry butter, and orange juice. And enough for seconds. My stomach has never been so ready for a day of hiking.
Today was also my first day of hiking in my new shoes! After snapping some pictures of the carnage I had wrought on the old pair I sent them off to their final resting place and slipped into the new ones. These are half a size bigger and fit better for my growing feet and are not falling apart, both great advantages. As soon as we started hiking I could feel the difference, these shoes had far more padding and cushioning than then old pair which made the rocky sections much more enjoyable. It'll take a couple days to fully break them in, but we have a nice easy 12mi day today and then 3 days of Trail Days before we put any serious miles on them.
The top of a ridge in a national forest with spotty cell service is not the ideal place to arrange transportation or lodging, but that's what had to happen. We needed a way to get to Damascus from Perisburg today, a way to get Lookout and I back to the trail after the weekend, a way to get Classy to her new city by Sunday afternoon, and a place to sleep for the weekend. It's not complicated to get to trail days... everyone in the hiker community knows about it and there are hundreds of cars heading there that are happy to pick up a few hikers along the way, but Classy's time constraints and our desire to hang with her for as long as possible meant our only option was to rent a car for the weekend. Which meant we needed a shuttle to a town that had a car rental place that still had cars (Perisburg Enterprise had rented all their cars). 
Long story short, after convening at a overlook with signal and after much googling and many phone calls we had a car reservation in Blacksburg, VA, a shuttle reservation to get us there, and had decided that sleeping in tent city was the best lodging option because all the hotels, hostels, bed and breakfasts, and cabins anywhere near Damascus were full and the city wasn't allowing tenting at private residences.
We booked it down the last few miles into Perisburg, found Don (our shuttle driver) waiting at the trailhead for us, and headed off to get our car. A 35min drive through the scenic mountains of Virgina and we arrived. The Enterprise smelled nice inside and had AC, both much appreciated. We got the car,  a Jeep Compass because they were out of smaller cars, and headed over to Panera for lunch. A sandwich and a smoothie later we headed over to Walmart to get some weekend supplies and then were on our way (back) to Damascus.
The drive down was very pretty... It's an interesting perspective to be in a car after having walked for so long. It's easy to see a lot with a car because of how fast it moves, but it's also hard to see, to really see and appreciate, anything while moving that fast. 
We crossed over the AT on I-81 in Atkins on our way down and the signage which describes the amenities on each exit claimed there was no camping available there... blatantly false.
Just a heads up, I'm not intending to post journals about our time at trail days... This is a journal about my hike of the AT and we're not doing any hiking this weekend! I may do a couple of shorter entires if anything interesting happens, but otherwise I'll be back on the trail Sunday!","Woods Hole

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565563,"We were up at 4am, packed up our gear, and were on the road by 5am. Classy had places to be early afternoon which necessitated the early departure. Just as I finished packing up it started raining... very fortunate timing.
On the way back to Perisburg we stopped at McDonald's for breakfast and Walmart to pick up a few things. I grabbed a replacement pocket knife for the one I lost the day after Chestnut Knob, a new shirt to replace the long sleeve camp shirt I was sending home, a small/cheap watch to replace the one I was sending home, and some snacks for the trail.
At the trailhead we said goodbye to Classy and then hit the trail by 8am, a respectable time even for a normal day, nevermind the drive we had made. My bag is now even smaller/lighter with the clothes I sent home... I'm able to roll my pack all the way down and not use any of the roll top, which is nice.
The trail was a bit overgrown around Pearis Cemetary, the first time we've run into that on the trail. The skies were gloomy with the ridges which surround Perisburg topped with dark gray clouds that we'd no doubt be hiking into. We did a bit of road waking as we crossed a 4 lane bridge across a river and I noticed that the balls of my feet tend to hurt when I walk on hard surfaces, such as this road or the sidewalks of Damascus, but not on the trail (even the rocks).
After crossing the road the trail ducked back into the woods and started ascending away from civilization. A train rumbled and then faded off into the distance as we hiked. We crossed a powerline, a gravel road, and then came across a steam, our signal that we had competed about 50% of the current hill and that we should tank up on water because there wouldn't be any for the next 7mi. Back up the hill we went and then we crossed a powerline... and a gravel road... and a stream... Dammit. Ok, now no more water and we're halfway done.
We climbed up into the clouds as we neared the top of the ridge and we stopped for a break at a shelter along the trail. It was listed as having a view, but we couldn't see anything through the thick fog. Even the other hikers, a mere 100ft away, were faint sillouettes to us.
The trail from here was pretty overgrown and my bottom half got soaked from the wet leaves. I crossed a crackling power line and could see small blueberries already forming on the plants in the clearing, though they had a ways to go before they're ready to eat.
The trail wound through pleasant forests and meadows dotted with wildflowers. The clouds cleared throughout the afternoon and the fog dissapated leaving us with a beautiful afternoon. Coming down to the next shelter I hiked down a series of switchbacks that were basically flat... I'm sure they're appreciated by the SOBOs but the distance seemed to stretch on as the switchbacks continued.
I had a snack at the shelter while I waited for Lookout. According to posters we had been seeing all day, the shelter was closed for overnight use because moths had killed a number of trees in the area and made it unsafe. Sitting there with a couple other hikers though, we could see a couple dead trees, but nothing endangering the shelter. In any case, Lookout and I were planning on going to head down to The Captains, it's claim to fame being the zipline used to cross the river to get there. We had heard it was closed because the owner was having health issues, but figured we'd check it out anyways.
Unfortunately the rumors were true, the zipline was still in place but the rope needed to get it from our side of the river had been removed, giving us no way to cross. Oh well.We pressed on, heading for the next shelter. PUDS everywhere. The trail kinda followed the river for a bit but also pointlessly climbed a bunch of hills along the way. We crossed the river via a footbridge just as the rain started in earnest. So close to being dry for the day, yet so far away...
The overgrown trail again got me more wet than the actual rain as we climbed a steep hill just before the shelter. We grabbed water from a spring 0.2 before the shelter and when we arrived found the shelter full. Well, not full... the hikers there said we could all fit, but realistically it wasn't going to be comfortable. Just as Lookout and I started to pitch our tents 2 guys who had finished their dinner decided that they were going to move on opening up room for us. We jumped on that and setup in the shelter. After dinner I closed out the night with some music and journaling.Classy's presence will be missed in our tramily :( Best of luck to her at her new job!","Perisburg
",Bailey Gap Shelter,"May 21, Sun",24.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565766,"This morning everyone in the shelter got up and started packing up around 5am and I finally got fed up and rolled out my quilt at 6am. I hit the trail by 7 but the overnight rain had made all the rocks very slippery which made progress slow.
Walking through the wet grass which lined the trail got my shoes wetter than if I had just walked through a stream, which was a bit annoying because I had in fact worked very hard not to walk through a stream. Through the trees I could see fog still clinging to the valleys below.
Reaching a road I came across some TRAIL MAGIC and enjoyed a granola bar, opting to leave the water bottles there for someone who needed them more. In a campsite just 0.2 up the trail I ran into Overdrive and Panther who I'd learn (at the next shelter, when we chatted) were the angels who provided the magic with some free food they had found at trail days.
Up at Wind Rocks, an overlook, I got a great view of the valley formed by the ridge I stood atop and the adjacent one, the fog still rolling along the ground below. I stood up there a bit longer and was joined by Norba, but as he arrived a cloud rolled in and swallowed the view.
I stopped for a snack break at the next shelter and chatted with Overdrive and Panther and as we sat there talking it was hard to tell if it was raining or if the trees were just dumping their remaining water on us. Lookout and I headed out and ran into some people we had met at trail days slack packing and then headed up our big hill of the day, a 1700ft up-and-over a ridge.
I came to Kelley's Knob, the 2nd one of the trail. This one was much more pleasant than the one in Georgia with it's lack of snow, sleet, or freezing rain. Lookout and took a snack here from atop the towering pillars of rock divided by deep cravaces. From our vantage point we could see down a long valley dotted with fields and farms and the long ridges stretching off into the distance. One of them likely contains dragon's tooth, a trail landmark that I've visited on previous weekend trips I've done that we'll hit tomorrow.
At the next shelter Lookout and I sat down to plan for tomorrow. We realized that from where we were staying tonight we would have to either:1) do a 16mi day2) lug enough water for the night up and over the 1500ft mountain that had dragons tooth, which I knew to be quite rocky, 3) do a 25+ mile day to the next water (which runs off a cow pasture and so is not good to drink), 4) go to 4 Pines hostel for the night because they have water 
We decided on option 4)... it's going to rain tomorrow so it will be nice to be dry for the night anyways and 4 Pines provided some free pulled pork that we enjoyed at trail days, so it seems like they're cool people.
On my way through some (non cow pasture) fields down in a valley I picked some clover blossoms to add to dinner tonight. We had learned that they are edible at an edible plants walk/talk we went to at trail days and with them so easy to get it seemed like a good time to try them. Safely tucked away in my hip belt, I hiked on, catching up to Lookout at a famous AT landmark, the Keffer Oak. Over 300 years old, the MASSIVE tree stands over 18ft around and is the largest tree on the southern AT. We grabbed some pictures while admiring it's overwhelming tree-ness before moving on.
Our last challenge for the day was a steep 1500ft ascent onto another ridge. The way was steep and our tired legs from the previous 20mi didn't make it any easier, but once onto the ridge the terrain was flat and easy. We noticed some mysterious piles of rocks, maybe 20-30 in total, which sat on the top of the ridge, presumably human-made sometime in the past. 
We reached the turnoff for camp and headed down. The shelter tonight was 0.4mi off trail, normally farther than we'd prefer to go, but this shelter had the only water on the entire ridge, so we didn't have much of a choice. The shelter itself made up for the walk, it was huge and had a fully covered porch and picnic table. To get to the water source you had to walk past 2 very old chimneys, the associated house having long since fallen down, and a small wooden cabin which still had a few beams visible. In the ground, full of water, was a circular stone cistern... this must've at one time been settled land, perhaps related to the stone piles we had seen earlier.
Lookout and I arrived first, but were joined by Norba and Chops, the two Swiss guys, and RocketWreck before the night was over.","Bailey Gap Shelter
",Sarver Hollow Shelter,"May 22, Mon",21
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565767,"The rain started just as we woke up this morning, what better motivation to go hiking for the day? The covered porch came in handy and allowed us to get ready out of the rain before heading out into the morning. 
The rain was very light, enough to wet all the rocks and plants but not enough to soak us. From several rocky outcrops I could see the fog lifting, literally... from view to view it would be higher above the valley below.
Though the terrain started smoothly, soon the ridge narrowed and the trail led us across the tops of several rocky outcrops, slick from the morning drizzle. Hiking alone, I ended up falling once, sliding down the rock a bit, unharmed and undamaged. I may seriously have to think about getting different shoes for the whites... these just don't have very much traction.
I crossed the Eastern Continental Divide which seperates the water which eventually finds its way to get Atlantic from that which flows to the Gulf of Mexico and I entered into the Atlantic watershed. The trail descended across the side of an exposed ridge which yielded some views of the surrounding mountains towering in every direction as swirls of fog drifted between them.
Lookout and I took a quick break at a shelter, the last cover we'd have for the rest of the day before continuing on. I listened to a couple of podcasts and one of them was sponsored by a smoothie company whose advertisments every 15min just made me want a smoothie... cruel torture if you ask me.
This section of trail would be beautiful on a clear day, hiking along and between the mountains as we were. I caught Lookout again at a river, the last water we'd have today, and stayed for a few minutes to eat a quick lunch before we tackled the last hill of the day. The 4mi uphill seemed to stretch on forever and the trail got rockier as we ascended, a couple spots requiring a bit of scrambling to navigate. The last section of the ascent was marked with a solitary view, but after passing 4 clearings that all looked like they would be great vistas (all blank white canvases of fog), we gave up guessing which was the labeled view.
We finally reached the top, marveled at the fact that according to the signs the ascent from the river to dragon's tooth was 4mi but the descent from dragon's tooth to the river was 5.4mi, and headed out on the short side trail to the tooth. Reaching the vista we found it, as expected, completely fogged in. The slabs of rock jutting into the air were impressive in their own right though, and we climbed halfway up (deciding any further would be too risky with the wet rock) and sat for a few minutes until the wind started to rob us of too much warmth.
Just after dragon's tooth we ran into another landmark in our hike, 700 miles! The AT north of dragon's tooth contains some steep sections across several rock faces which were a bit treacherous with the wet conditions. We had been lucky all morning, the rain had never materialized into anything more than a sprinkle, but it still made for slow going. We used our first ladders of the trail, rebar driven into the rock face to form rungs, but the smooth metal was even more slick than the rocks.
We laughed as we passed a sign warning the ascending hikers that the next section of trail was 'strenuous' and hiked down to the road. From there we followed the green pine tree blazes on the road to the hostel which was a 3-bay garage dedicated to hikers. Inside were a bunch of couches, a couple beds, a couple recliners, some cots, a fridge, stove, bathroom and shower, and wood stove. 
Anywhere flat was fair game, so Lookout and I both claimed a couch and took advantage of the shower. One of the other hikers(?) seemed to know what was going on and had the keys to the minivan and ran us down to the gas station to pick up food. I got a BBQ sandwich, a pint of ice cream, and some chocolate milk which we took back to eat. Still hungry I asked TrailName (yes, that's his trail name) to get me some cheese sticks and gave him money for them. The owner of the hostel also gave us a huge bowl of homemade hiker bars... Granola, chocolate, nuts, etc. They went very well with ice cream while they were still warm.
As you can see, I had a pretty tough night... Laying on the couch with my feet up, eating, and catching up with the rest of the world on my phone.","Sarver Hollow Shelter

Outside the sky was still very gray, the mountains around still obscured by clouds, but it wasn't actively raining. A couple people decided to zero and started working on convincing their hiking friends to zero with them, claiming that we were supposed to get as much of 1in of rain today. That's not what my forecast said, but in any case, rain isn't worth a zero in either Lookout or my opinion, so we headed out.
Not a mile into hiking I lost grip on my pole and accidentally left it behind sticking out of the mud at the 45deg angle I had placed it at. Lookout, not expecting it, walked right past it before realizing and I had to go back for it.
We walked along a river cascading down a series of rock steppes, the slanted layers of rock causing the multitude of waterfalls the same as that which formed the mountains and prominent rock formations we're hiking through. We came to a pasture and got pretty close to a couple cows before they yielded the trail and let us on our way. Though we had managed to dry our shoes overnight, walking through the grass they were soaked again immediately.
Cross road, walk through field, over bridge, we came to a part of the trail almost swallowed by the river that it paralleled... a couple more inches and the trail would be under water.
We climbed up through a field, the hill not as steep as I remembered it from my last trip here and then ran a ridge which wasn't as flat as I remembered it. We popped out into the parking lot for McAffe's knob and continued hiking on the widest trail we had yet seen, this section being so popular.
Even though water looks very sparse on this section of trail (and it is in certain seasons), with all the rain we had (and were continuing to get) water wasn't an issue and we didn't have to carry much with us.
We finally reached McAfee knob, probably the most iconic place on the AT, and found it, as expected, completely fogged in. At least our pics will be unique? You don't normally see pictures of one of the more popular views on the AT fogged in...
We took a few pictures and moved on, our next goal Tinker Cliffs. Once again the trail wasn't as flat as I remembered as we climbed several sizeable hills and crossed a couple tricky rock faces (that I fell on twice). As the morning wore on, the lack of views, dirth of other hikers, challenging terrain, and neverending walk through the misty forest had me increasingly introspective until we finally reached the cliffs. I had a well deserved reward fruit snack.
No view. We took hiking the cliffs a bit slower but soon enough we were past them and descending. We passed Scorched Earth Gap, the turnoff I had taken last time I had hiked here, but this time I continued heading north into new territory. Perhaps as expected, Lambert's meadow shelter wasn't in a meadow and we only took a quick break there before continuing on, eager to finish today's hiking before the rain, which had up to now been very mild, picked up.
Though there wasn't any indicated in AWOL, we decided to bet on there being water on the trail in the next 4mi rather than carry it all the way from the shelter. We kept hiking, my feet hurting by this time, potentially from some blisters I may have developed from the wet day, and came across some water running down a rock face. Upon collecting it the water was yellow/brown in color, likely from the leaves it was running through, but we filtered it, which was the best we could do, and moved on towards camp.
We ended up finding better water running down the trail a little ways on. While it's usually better to stay away from trail water (who knows how many cow pies the previous hiker has stepped in), in this case there weren't many hikers on the trail at this point in the day and it was flowing well, so we dumped our urine colored water and filtered some new water.
We found a place to camp slightly sooner than we had intended but had to move on because of the preponderance of widow-makers in the trees above. We finally reached angels gap to find a large (obviously temporary) stream running through it and a couple campsites, which we appropriated for our use. We both managed to get our tents up just before the real rain started and hung out for the rest of the afternoon in our tents. 
While I chilled in my tent I was eyeing a wall of water slowly creep towards my position. During a break in the rain I got out and dug a little trench uphill to divert the water, but it was for nought. The past few hours of rain had been enough to create a river that ran directly under my tent. Though the floor of my tent kept me dry up until now, it wasn't going to last all night.
During another break in the rain, just as dusk was falling I moved my tent up onto the embankment that Lookout had intelligently setup on. Though not a freestanding tent, I managed to move it with all my stuff inside in one piece and get it setup again, which I was pretty happy about. Unfortunately, my tent was now setup on a ~20deg slope... Oh well, I'd rather be dry than flat.
While I had been excited to revisit some places that I'd seen before, it didn't exactly go as I had expected. This section was tougher than I expected it to be given my trail legs compared to last time I hiked it. It was interesting seeing these landmarks in rainy conditions (I can see why B~~~ did this section in all 4 seasons... The weather/season has a huge effect on how you perceive the trail). We missed out on the HomePlace restaurant (which is only open Thurs-Sun) and the views, but this is within weekend driving distance of DC so I can come back if I want to see them again.","Four Pines Hostel

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566078,"After my tent relocation I had no issues with water for the rest of the night, despite the continued rain overnight.
We packed up and headed out, the fog still pervading the air around us as we began our hike. We passed a sign for an overlook, but didn't bother to head down the side trail since there was no chance of seeing anything but fog. We passed a couple people camped under a massive stone outcrop who hadn't even pitched their rain fly since the stone shelf provided ample rain protection. They had a sock placed near the campfire (presumably to dry it) which was in the process of smouldering as I walked by.
I passed another view marked in AWOL to find it also obscured by fog, although the sky was brightening and through the upper layers of fog I could see bright white puffy clouds, which was hopeful for a nice day. A couple minutes after I had moved on from that overlook the fog did break and thankfully the trail was following a rocky ridge which contained several spots, which had not been designated a ""view"" by AWOL, certainly counted as a view in my book. A lake appeared from the mists below us, contained by the steep sides of the surrounding mountains. Past the lake, also to the west, a city was gleaming in the morning sunshine as well as the airport we had been hearing throughout the morning. To the east Daleville and I-81 were visible, both in our path today.
We continued hiking, passing under a set of crackling powerlines that had a ton of blueberry plants growing under them, their fruits fully formed but still ripening. We descended into the valley and the amount of mud we had to jump over grew commensurately. We passed a turtle chilling in the trail and walking through a long series of dense bushes we popped out into civilization, emerging into a 4 lane road busy with traffic. Though we could hear it coming up, it was still a bit surprising to re-enter society so abruptly. 
We didn't have to walk far to come to our destination, everything a thru hiker could want: an outfitter, a food store, a BBQ place, and an ABC store. We ate at 3 lil pigs BBQ and enjoyed the free banana pudding dessert that they give to hikers. They asked us if we wanted them and we were confused for a moment... First that that was an option (we hadn't heard of their special offer) and second that it wasn't obvious that we wanted it. We recovered our wits and politely accepted. Lookout ended up packing out am order of sweet potato fries that he ordered after his first meal before they offered us dessert.
We exploded our packs onto the lawn of the grocery store, laid out our gear to dry in the sun, and food shopped in shifts while the other watched the gear. While we were packing up a man drove up and offered us a ride anywhere we needed to go, a very kind offer we gratefully refused since we had everything we needed in this plaza.
At this point Lookout and I split... he had to mail a package of spare gear back home and wasn't sure how long it was going to take. I'm meeting some friends this weekend and will be doing a lower milage day with them, so I'm going to push it a little bit for the next few days to get ahead of Lookout.  That way Lookout will catch me (and friends) right before they go home and he and I can continue hiking together. My plan for today was to go another 15mi, 7 more than Lookout intended to hike.
As I headed out of town I found an Indian strawberry, another edible plant we had learned about at trail days, which I tried. The fruit was tasteless and had a ton of seeds in it... not sure I'd recommend it. I also saw many clover as I walked along the trail which was paralleling 81, but they weren't worth picking since I was carrying as much food as I had in my pack.
I crossed under 81 (for the second time, heading south this time) and up through some fields into the woods. I mounted a ridge by topping a series of progressively higher hills and left the noise of the highway corridor behind. The hills felt hard today... I think the 20+ mile days are starting to add up.
Lookout ended up catching up to me a couple miles before his home for he night. We made several interesting stream crossings, made so by the water being so high and quickly moving. In each case we were able to find a log bridging the stream and balance across it to stay dry.
At last we came to the shelter and I stopped in for a couple minute break. We checked the weather and according to the radar it was supposed to start raining/thunderstorming any minute, so I hustled back onto the trail.
I hiked as quickly as I could given the hills and the condition of my legs and eventually found the first crossing of the Blue Ridge Parkway, a road which threaded it's way through these mountains that we'd loosely follow for the next hundred miles.
Whether the fact that it was a weekday, the evening hour, or the weather, the parkway and overlooks were deserted, which was nice. Every couple miles the trail would dump out at one of the parkway overlooks from which I could see the fields dotting the landscape below, more mountains in distance, and a patchwork of clouds illuminated from different angles by the sinking sun making them look very dynamic. As I watched a rainbow formed from some far off rain showers (that I hoped weren't headed this way) and I grudgingly took that as my cue to keep moving.
The trail followed within sight of the parkway for a while before coming to another overlook where I found TRAIL MAGIC. 3 cokes sat on a picnic table at the mouth of the trail and I tried one, hoping that my taste buds had changed enough that I could stomach one and take advantage of this generosity. Alas, I managed to get through half of it before giving up. Coke is just not my thing.
I finally reached the shelter just after 7, 3 hours after the rain had supposedly started, dry and happy to be done for the day. I managed to squeeze in the shelter since this site didn't have any tent sites (and anything reasonably flat that could be confused for a tent site (including the start of the path to the the privy) had already been taken).
I had dinner and settled down for the night, day 1 of my extra miles done.","Angels Gap
",Bobblets Gap Shelter,"May 25, Thu",23.50
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566503,"People were up at 5 and on the trail at 6. I got up at 610 and was on the trail at 630. I grabbed my bear bag, which I had had to hang a fair way up the trail back to the AT, on my way out of camp and stuffed it into my backpack. I walked 0.8 miles until I hit a Blue Ridge Parkway overlook and then found a nice spot and dug out my food for breakfast. 
The sun had risen some time ago by the time I reached the overlook as the last hints of color were fading from the sky, but sunbeams shot down at valley floor from between the clouds. I had my packets of oatmeal and had a nutter butter for a couple extra calories, a complete hiker breakfast. Tattoo showed up, having left camp a few minutes after me, and we chatted for a bit about the futility of trying to capture views with a camera and how most of them would likely not be that interesting pictures or be indistinguishable from the hundreds of other views on the AT by the time we finished. Only time will tell how valuable these pictures will be to me and my hike, so I snapped a few pictures before I left... can't help it.
Throughout the morning the clouds made threats... of what I'm not exactly sure, because it didn't feel like rain, but they were rather gray in some areas. Passing my first shelter of the day I stopped for a snack at an vista which looked back at the agriculture which dotted the flat land west of our mountains.
The trail headed down Cove Mt and into a deep gap cut by a river. I probably should've stopped and took a dip, which would've relieved the day's heat and gone a long way towards cleaning off the accumulated sweat, but I had many miles to go yet today (not a good excuse... I know).
Heading up my next mountain I met a woman doing trail maintenance, I'd estimate in her 60s or 70s, hiking up the same hill as I with a saw at least 5ft long and various other woods tools. She was headed to clear a blowdown which had been reported and warned me of a larger blowdown further up the trail that she wasn't equipped to deal with today. I soon moved past her, but am very grateful for the work that she and others do to keep the trail open and easily passable for hikers. Blowdowns are not usually too difficult to bypass/climb over but it breaks the rhythm of hiking and too many can really slow progress.
Next I headed down that same mountain I had just climbed along the boundary of national forest lands, the single red blaze indicating that I was looking out into private land. I came to the blowdown she has warned me about, a massive tree resting a few feet above the trail too low to slide under but also too high to easily jump over. It had come down recently because the hikers had not established a definitive way around, though it was obvious a few had been tried. The tree was situated on a slope that made going around it difficult, so I ended up climbing the hill a bit until I could haul myself up onto the tree and jump down to the other side.
The trail wound down into a narrow valley between the looming hills, covered with towering trees. The valley was no more than 100ft across, just enough room for a stream and the trail before the land sloped steeply uphill. I passed through a couple valley junctions where a couple such valleys met and which had a bit more available land and usually a campsite or two.
I stopped at a really nice shelter for lunch... the river ran by just a little ways from the shelter, the shelter itself had a loft with additional sleeping space and a window, and a deck and picnic table. So deep in the valley, the shelter and surrounding area felt very isolated and safe from the outside world and most of what mother nature might throw at it.
Finishing my lunch I started my challenge for the day, 4 hills which totalled over 3000ft of elevation gain. The day was sunny and warm, but the hills were summited in time. Though the AT never crossed or intersected it, it was easy to tell how close I was to the BRP by how many day hikers were out on a particular section of trail.
A quick break at a shelter, some more uphill, lots of tall grass and switchbacks, and I emerged onto the summit of apple orchard mountain, which I shared with a FAA radar installation housed within it's large white sphere atop a tower. I wanted to camp there for the great views, but decided against it because there were no signs of others having camped here, because it was fairly windy this afternoon, and because it would add 2mi to tomorrow which was already looking tight. 
After taking in the views for a few minutes I headed down, passing through the guillotine, a narrow rock passage with a large boulder wedged in overhead which might drop at any second and remove a hapless hiker's head. Ok, not really, it was pretty secure.
I made it to the shelter at 5, having taken 10hr to do my 23.7mi today. I'm trying not to push the pace past 2.5mi/hr because it's while hiking fast that my knees and feet tend to start to hurt, but it does make for a long day. After touching base with friends about plans for tomorrow I headed to bed.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567503,"For those who are wondering, I haven't given up on journaling, I'm just really behind. I got pretty sick for a couple days coming out of Waynesboro... not enough to get off trail, but enough that hiking was pretty miserable for 3 days, and so I didn't have any motivation to document it. Nothing too serious, probably just food poisoning, but when you can't eat the ~4000cal you're burning each day and when it's ~10mi between bathrooms, life gets a bit rough.
I'm back to normal health now and still hiking, in fact Lookout and I just walked out of Shenendoah this afternoon. 
Exciting and interesting things did happen during that time though, and I do intend to journal them, but being this far behind it's not feasible to do that and keep current. I think I'm going up pick up journaling from here (hopefully tonight) and use my long weekend off trail this weekend to catch up on some of the missed entries.","Ivy Creek Overlook

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567504,"Once again we had some late night company... Another bear! But this one didn't need any coaxing to keep its distance and wandered off soon enough. BA, Faceplant, and I all woke up to it but TopBunk slept through it and of course wanted to know if we got any pictures... Maybe next time we'll have her sleep on the outside of camp to make sure she hears it and gets her picture.
We all had breakfast and BA and Faceplant hit the trail first, followed a few minutes later by TopBunk and I. BA left the remaining beers in the fridge (I mean stream) for any hikers that might wander down here during the day looking for water.
We all reconvened about 3mi into the hike and headed up a gentle mountain together. We chatted a bit about Faceplant's thru hike, getting a few tips on places to stay or eat or avoid up north, and we chatted about some of my stories this far and how they compared to hers. The morning was perfect for hiking, sunny and cool and the trail gently wound up and down the grassy hills and we walked along.
Eventually we turned off trail, headed up hill, and came up Big Meadows Wayside, one on the 3 stores/restaurants along skyline drive. This was BA, Faceplant, and TopBunk's end point, but before they headed out we all got milkshakes. I got blackberry to go with my breakfast sandwich... It's really nice to be able to eat again :)
We said our goodbyes and I found it even a little more difficult than after last weekend to hit the trail again, knowing that they were heading back to their comfy lives and I still had another 100mi to go before I get a little break. 
Anyways, we back-tracked to the trail and started hiking again, but soon came to a great vista overlooking the valley and town below and stopped for a few minutes to chat with GrayEagle and admire the view. I hung around a bit longer and used the cell signal to check the status of last night's rocket launch and checking in with family that had been there. 
I didn't hit any major hills but did traverse a couple of rocky sections before coming to Rockspring shelter, where I found Lookout sprawled out enjoying a break. I followed suit and ended up napping for about an hour before a ridgerunner, the first we had seen since the Smokies, showed up for the night. We chatted a bit with her... In addition to (or perhaps as a qualification for) working as a ridge runner she had thru hiked several years ago. We weren't staying, but she let the others know that this shelter had a resident bear and raccoon and so they had to use the bear box instead of the pole, otherwise they'd just be feeding the raccoon instead of the bear.
We also met a guy doing a ""Flippity floppity hike"" in which he hiked from Harper's Ferry to Vermont, flipped back to hike from Harper's Ferry to Springer, and then was going to flop back to Vermont to head to ME. We didn't catch the reasoning, but certainly an interesting way to do it. In addition to some trail tips, he also passed on some wisdom about hiking. Poorly paraphrased:
There are 3 stages of hiking, the physical, the mental, and then the spiritual. Stage one involves conditioning the body so that hiking is not painful. Stage two involves figuring out your motivation for hiking and getting in the right head-space for the trail, not getting too attached to plans and going with the flow. And then in stage three you can really enjoy hiking and just being out in nature and existing on the trail.
This past week certainly knocked me back down to stage zero, but hopefully I can recover and start having more fun with hiking again this week.
The hike in the afternoon was pleasant and I felt good all afternoon. I did roll my ankle once, but that happens often enough and isn't a big deal. A couple minutes to walk it off and a day or so of a bit of soreness and it's back to new.
We hit Skyland, a restaurant along skyline drive, and stopped in for an early dinner. I am really glad that most places are hiker friendly, because we certainly smelled like hikers. I had a steak and cheese (gotta make up for those lost calories!) with sweet potato fries, yumm. 
After getting another water bottle to replace the Gatorade bottle which didn't fit nicely into my pack, we headed off and soon came up to the trail over to Stony Man. The tallest point on the AT in Shenendoah wasn't enough to convince us to do the extra 0.6mi, but the way was well traveled and full of day hikers walking up from their cars and normal people only hike if there's a view involved, so it must be pretty good. We emerged onto a large rocky outcrop with a good view of the mountains both north and south as well as the valley to the west. We snapped a couple pictures but didn't stay long amongst the crowd of people.
It wasn't much farther until we hit another view occupied only by a sole climber who had just climbed the rock face on which we stood to setup an anchor for additional climbers. We didn't distract him from his work for long before continuing on, hitting a picnic area soon after where we again found Butter and GrayEagle. They were incredulous... we left the shelter later than them that morning, stopped at wayside for food, took an hour nap, stopped at skyland for more food, and still caught them before they got to camp for the night. But hey, at the end of the day it doesn't matter how you got there, so long as you make it.
GrayEagle moved on but Lookout and I chatted with Butter for a few minutes... he used to be an aerospace engineer with a major company and worked on some cool projects that I've heard of and even a couple I've done work related to. He's now retired, but it is an interesting mix of people you meet out here.
While we were talking a couple parked their pickup and got out, admired the view and then a sign in front of it which explained the AT, turned around and noticed the hobos... I mean hikers, sitting behind them and came over to chat. They were curious about all the basics... How long we had been hiking and how long the whole thing would take? How did we get food? Why did we decide to hike? Had we seen wildlife? Had it rained alot? Etc. We chatted with them for a couple minutes and they seemed amazed that people did this for fun but left with a curiosity about the trail, which is always nice to impart. 
Lookout and I headed out, climbing the couple hundred feet to the top of The Pinnacle, a westward vista that we wanted to watch the sunset from. We had wanted to camp up there, but finding a suitable spot was not going to be easy (all the nearby terrain was either boulders or rocky and slanted) and it wasn't exactly clear if camping was allowed on this peak, so we settled for just watching the show and then walking the 0.8mi to the next shelter after. While we were sitting there watching the sun sink towards the horizon we were visited by a family of ferrets (I didn't even know they lived in this region!) a couple rocks over who checked us out but then retreated back into their home.
From our position we could see the sun, a deep red, setting behind large banks of clouds which were presumably bringing tonight's rain. Behind us the moon hung high in the sky, waxing gibbous, visible in between scattered clouds. Before us the city of Luray sprawled across the valley, penned in on all sides by mountains and ridges. The opposite ridge I knew to be the Massanutten ridge, which I had hiked before and from which I had viewed Shenendoah. I could see a total of 5 ridges in the distance, each one a lighter shade of blue than the previous, the peaks of the farthest just barely visible between the gaps in the nearer. Luray's lights blinked on as darkness approached and a firetruck, visible from it's bright red blinking lights, raced through town on it's way to some emergency.
Just as the light started to really fade from the sky, Lembas and SeaWolf joined us and hung out for a couple of minutes. As night settled in, the wind picked up and we elected to vacate the ridge and head for the warmth of our sleeping bags. The hike down to the shelter, as all night hikes do, seemed to take longer than it ought to have for such a short hike, but eventually we reached the shelter to find it empty except for GrayEagle. 
All of us piled into the massive shelter, having more than twice the room we would've had if the shelter had been full, which was nice. GrayEagle warned us that a bear has stopped by while he was making dinner... a good incentive to make sure all food got hung that night.
As we bedded down we could hear some movement around the shelter... So we all switched back directions to have our heads facing out of the shelter. We'd all rather to be able to see bears and not have mice climb over our faces tonight. The joys of shelters...","Bearfence Hut

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567505,"Lookout was up particularly early this morning, coming back to the shelter all packed up at 6am. As soon as the lights went out last night the party had started... Mice everywhere. In the rafters, running up and down the walls, rifling though our backpacks. Most people leave all of their backpack pockets open overnight so that a mouse doesn't have to chew their way in should they wish to check it out (they're going to get in either way, might as well make it the way that leaves your pack in one piece), but we could still hear them climbing around inside them. At about 11pm Lookout had had enough and went and setup his tent out behind the shelter (and saw GrayEagle's bear).
I should've done the same... I didn't sleep very well with all the activity going on. At one point a clumsy mouse squeeled, waking up at least half the shelter, as it fell off a ledge and then scampered off. Thankfully in their thourogh search the mice didn't find anything useful in my pack and hadn't chewed anything, but it was still nerve-wracking listening to them all night. Shelters are quickly becoming not worth it to sleep in.
We hit the trail early and followed the trail down into Thornton Gap and filled up on water at the visitors center. The water tasted terrible, so after the uphill out of the gap we traded in out at the first spring we ran into for some better tasting water. As we hiked it started raining gently, but the trees kept most of it off of us as we hiked. We were pushing the pace a bit, planning to get to the wayside before the real rain started and hang out there for a couple hours to eat, charge electronics, and be out of the rain and then just finish the last 6mi up to the next shelter later in the afternoon.
We did make it to the wayside without getting wet (well, at least not by rain), but were a little disappointed to find that this wayside was smaller than the others, didn't have any indoor seating, didn't serve milkshakes (I think AWOL should have a warning in the book), didn't have a view, and had no cell service and no wifi. Those combination of factors nixed our plans to hang out there for long, so we got some breakfast and ate it pretty quickly. Even with only a couple minute break we had still gotten pretty cold, so with no shelter except the bathrooms available, we got ready to move again.
It figures, we hike fast enough to beat the rain, and then we hike back out into it. Before we headed out we wanted to call ahead to the hostel, since they tend to fill up when it rains, but the lack of cell service left us with only one option... Pay phone! It took us a couple tries to get it working (it wasn't clear if the money needed to go in first, or if you dial first, or how much money it needed, and how long that gave you, and when that time started...), but we got through and made our reservation.
We took the afternoon slower than the morning. It rained for the first couple hours and so we ducked into a shelter after the first 6mi and took a break out of the rain. I napped for about an hour before we got moving again and thankfully the rain let up not too long after. The sun tried, but didn't quite succeed in, coming out as we hiked, but all the overlooks were fogged in as we passed them. The afternoon was supposed to be mostly downhill, according to AWOL, but it didn't feel like it as the miles added up.
As we were nearing the end, just 1.2mi from where we'd get off trail to go to the hostel, Lookout dubbed me the Crusher of Dreams after I corrected his ""1.2 to go!"" to ""1.7, including the 0.5 to the hostel"". 
We arrived, claimed a bunk, showered, and got a ride down into town to PaveMint, a gastropub with a great selection of beer and delicious food where we had dinner. We chatted for a while with a guy who overheard us talking about the trail and is a hiker himself, before heading over to the grocery store for a bit of resupply to make it to Harper's Ferry. I crashed pretty much as soon as we got back to the hostel, tired from the lack of sleep last night and the long day.","Byrd's Nest #3 Hut

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567718,"I managed to wake up pretty late this morning due to my handy-dandy earplugs. We had 2 snorers last night, also not an issue. I didn't hear it, but apparently one of those people complained to the hostel owner, Mike, that the room was too loud last night. He probably didn't appreciate the irony...
Mike gave a bunch of hikers a ride into town, Lookout among them (to get cash to pay for the night), so I got the morning to chill and catch up on the world. Did a bit of journaling, some surfing, some YouTube watching... It was nice.
They returned and we slowly got packed up, finally getting out the door at 1040, the last hikers to leave. It seems like returning along a trail is always faster than the first time you hiked it, but the 0.5 back to trail still seemed pretty long. We finally hit the trail at 11am, our latest start yet, and finished Shenendoah National Park, the whole 0.2mi that remained.
In total, I saw 5 bear, heard 2 more bear, saw a bobcat, lots of deer, a couple rabbits, a family of ferrets, and a thunder chicken (grouse) while in the park. I don't know that it's because Shenendoah has so much more wildlife than the rest of the trail, so much as the wildlife here just isn't afraid of humans since there's no hunting and the park is so heavily used.
Anyways, we headed down past a wayside (no, not like the roadside waysides in the park, a shelter... Pet peeve of mine: it would be nice if names were standardized to conform with expectations so that they were actually useful) and continued hiking in the morning sunshine and cool temperatures. We hiked past the street we had taken into town last night, past the US government zoological park, and then headed uphill.
We stopped at Denton Shelter, unique in that it had a spring-fed solar shower, a deck, chairs, and horseshoes pits. We took a break there for about an hour and I napped for most of it, enjoying the afternoon. It's pretty easy to tell that we're near a major city by the amount of air traffic overhead... In this case we're on Dulles' flight path because it  seemsems like there's a plane flying overhead every couple minutes.
Continuing on I began to hear the sounds of the highway, faint at first and then growing to drown out the sounds of nature as I approached and passed under I66. I've driven this highway many times, to all my Virginia hiking trips in fact, so I always find it exciting to know exactly where I am on trail, such as at a landmark like this.
Of course climbing down to the highway meant that I would have up climb back up away from it, and as expected a decent uphill ensued. Partway up I heard something romping around in the woods, perhaps a bear, but I never got a look at it. 
The hike from there seemed to stretch on a bit... the sun starting to set and cast shadows through the trees which seemed to make time accelerate and the miles from today started to add up in my feet and knees. I was glad to reach the shelter when we finally pulled in at around 6pm. Despite how late we started and the break we took, we still had plenty of time in the day to do the miles we need to.
There were actually 2 shelters here, a small old building which looked like it could probably only hold the 4 hikers AWOL listed, and a just-finished shelter with 2 levels, a covered porch, 2nd floor windows, and a firepit out front. This shelter will be much appreciated by hikers, especially since this spot only has one tent site. The shelter was so new that the ladders and scaffolding used to construct it were still chained to a tree right out front (though that might be slightly unnecessary... I don't know any hiker who is going to pack out scaffolding). 
With only one tent site, we opted for the shelter... Hopefully this shelter is so new that the mice haven't discovered it yet. Lookout packed wine from town, a box of white zifendel, which he shared and made an excellent after dinner drink. Bodybag, Yukon, Stickshift, and a couple other hikers had built a fire which we all hung out around as dusk closed in. Not too long after though I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and headed to bed amongst the lightning bugs in glowing in the forest.","Front Royal
",Dick's Dome Shelter,"Jun 06, Tue",19
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567793,"Again not a terribly early morning, we hit the trail by 8. The trail wound up and through Sky Meadows state park, which I've visited before to watch meteor showers away from the DC lights. The sun shown down on me as I hiked across several meadows in the park... Couldn't ask for a better morning walk.
The meadow gradually transitioned back to forest, first a tree or two dotting the grass, then a few more starting to fill the sky, until the grass could no longer grow and gave way to standard undergrowth. We hiked along and eventually crossed Rt 50, a substantial 4 lane road, and headed back into the woods. 
Not long after we passed the trailhead the DCUL's mobile trail magic trip had ended last year, and the spot where Faceplant, BA, I, and several others had waited for the shuttle to be reversed. I headed back into known territory, landmarks like streams and hills starting to ring bells again, though I'm the opposite direction that I had hiked last time. 
We stopped at a shelter for elevensies and in the course of packing up I left one of my water bottles behind (I'd discover 4mi later)... Whoops. I think the saying is ""Never get on rollercoaster with full stomach"", but that's just what we did, starting our ride on the 13mi of constant ups and downs that gave this section of trail it's name. It's not the severity of hills that characterizes this section, it's the number, and we quickly checked off 4 climbs of ~500ft each. As I hiked I found the place BA gave away his last beer and the campsite we had met Moxie and Sunshine at during the trip last year. 
Though the weather had held for the morning, the sky soon started to cloud over with dark clouds and finally a chilly rain started to fall. As if specially arranged for us, it was at this moment that we reached the 1000mi mark, complete with rain commemorate all the precipitation we had already walked though to get here. We didn't stay long to celebrate and quickly headed down to the next shelter, not far down the trail. 
Our miles 2/3 done for the day, there wasn't any point in getting wet unless we wanted to (and we didn't), so we took a long break in the shelter to let the rain pass. We ended up waiting 2hr, during which time we participated in our favorite activities, eating and sleeping, before finally deciding to push on. The rain had passed but the trees were still doing their part to help, but there wasn't any way to avoid that.
We had another 2 moderate climbs, including the site of last year's sweaty hug from a thru hiker after he received magic, until we reached the hostel. Bear's Den Hostel is an old stone building built to resemble a European castle back in the 30's. The ATC/PATC manage a hostel and trail center in the building now, giving hikers a place to stay and providing info for shorter distance hikers.
Lookout and I had agreed to stop and get some food before finishing the rollercoaster, another 4mi, today so I ducked inside and got a pizza. I was sitting in the meal area waiting for it to cook and didn't see Lookout for 15 or so minutes and started to get worried that he had somehow missed both of the signed turnoffs for the hostel, since he had been hiking ahead of me. Just as my pizza finished he popped out of the bunkroom, where he had been hanging out.
It didn't take much convincing and suddenly we were staying here for the night. Staying came with, in addition to the pizza, a shower, laundry, a pint of ice cream, and a soda, all of which we took advantage of thoroughout the evening.","Dick's Dome Shelter
",Bear's Den Hostel,"Jun 07, Wed",18.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568205,"Bear's Den does a make-your-own breakfast and put out some pancake mix and freak mulberries from the trees out back, which was delicious. I got up early and made a first round, took a nap until a more reasonable hour, and then made a second batch before hitting the trail for the morning.
I soon came to the road I had been hearing yesterday afternoon, VA 7, which was busy enough that I had to wait several minutes before I could frogger myself across all 4 lanes of traffic. The trail was definitely becoming rockier and I crossed a couple of rock fields as I finished that last couple ups and downs of the rollercoaster. Just before finishing I came to a view with a couple camped out in their tent out on the ledge, a great campsite now that the rain had cleared and the valley below was visible.
I came to a sign proclaiming the VA/WV border, which I'd be following for the next couple miles before finally leaving VA. The sign marking the end of the roller coaster was missing, but I've hiked this section before and so recognized the mount for the sign that remained. 
The rollercoaster done, the next couple miles up on the ridge were easy and I took the opportunity to call a couple friends to make plans for this weekend when I'd be off trail. The morning was beautiful, sunny but not too warm as to be uncomfortable, and I turned on some Dave Matthews to hike to and enjoyed the morning. Through the trees I caught a couple glimpses of farmland as I hiked and I didn't end up seeing anyone else for the rest of the morning.
I stopped in at a really nice shelter that had a  porch, benches, lots of space, separate picnic table that's covered, and swinging chairs. The local trail club, PATC, likes making fancy shelters. I headed down to the water source to refill with a large group of school children, but didn't linger long. Pretty quickly after that I passed into WV border, done with VA! VA's been fun, but it's good to be done.
Lookout and I met up and headed down into Harper's Ferry, across the bridge across the Shenandoah River and into town. It was about 330 and the ATC closed at 5, so we headed straight there to check in. I was NOBO 655 and Lookout was 656 for the year. This is really the first good idea of our positioning we get (I was hiker 1456 in Amicola, but that doesn't include anyone who skipped the approach trail and many people who simply don't register) and so i looked through the book but didn't see anyone we had met before since we're moving a little faster than most people we meet.
Lookout and I headed down into town and got some food... I had a celebratory steak sandwich and beer. The restaurants all closed at 5pm, since they mainly catered to tourists, so it's a good thing we had moved as fast as we had this afternoon. After dinner I split with Lookout, who is taking zero tomorrow, and grabbed some ice cream from a stand which was also just about to close. I wandered around the monuments and signs as I ate, dumped my trash, and then kept moving. 
There was no sign for the WV/MD border as I crossed the railroad tressle over the Potomac. Finishing WV crossed off my second state of the day, 5 states down and 9 to go! The next section of trail followed the C&O canal for a couple miles and was easy hiking. After that the trail headed up Weaver Cliffs, which weren't as bad as I remembered from the last time I had hiked them at the end of my 3 day MD section hike, and then the trail flattened out again. I stopped in at Ed Garvey shelter and chatted with a couple hikers there for about 45 min while I decided if I should stay for the night or so a couple more miles. I still felt good and so decided to move on as the sun set to the west, lighting up the sky with oranges and pinks through the trees.
I reached the state park that had the war correspondents memorial just as the first stars came out. Muscularly I was feeling great, even after all the hiking I had already done, but my right knee was hurting a bit and so I decided it was smart to listen to my body and call it a night. At the state park's facilities I refilled on water for the night and used the bathrooms before continuing on another mile to Crompton Gap Shelter. By now it was fully dark, but it didn't take long for me to setup and crawl into my tent, tired from the long day. Even the planes flying overhead on their approach to Reagan didn't keep me up for long.","Bear's Den Hostel
",Crampton Gap Shelter,"Jun 08, Thu",30.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568207,"Well, the plan was to be on the trail by sunrise, but I had been hiking until almost 10pm last night so that didn't happen. I ended up hitting the trail at about 630. I stopped for a few moments at White Rock cliffs to admire the farmland spread out below me but otherwise kept moving. 
The plan was for me to get picked up by TopBunk in the late afternoon but we hadn't decided on a location yet. Though it would be another 30mi day, the terrain would be pretty easy, so finishing Maryland today wasn't out of the question, but that would require some pretty fast hiking to accomplish.
I took another break at the Washington monument (the one in MD) and ate a couple snacks at the top of the stone tower which had been closed due to a lightning strike the last time I had hiked this section. From my vantage point I could see the sun shining down on the rolling ridge to the north and the agriculture down below and enjoyed the light breeze which took some of the edge off the warm morning.
From there it wasn't far until I crossed I-70, a road I've driven many times, and headed up to Annapolis rocks. As I was enjoying my lunch I was surprised to see a helmeted head pop up over the rock face and then clamber up onto the shelf. Shouting a couple commands down, he set about setting an anchor to allow more climbers to ascend under a top-rope, which I watched for a time before moving on. 
By this time the heat of the day had hit fill force and even flat sections were drawing sweat. Passing some snacking section hikers I received some TRAIL MAGIC in the form of a handful of grapes and a clementine. The hikers lived in New York and did a section of the trail each year and, as they had with me, would sometimes hand out a few snacks as they went. The combination of the moisture and sweetness of the grapes were delicious on this hot afternoon and I tucked the clementine away for later as I thanked them and moved on.
The ridge I was hiking stretched on for what seemed like forever and became very rocky in parts, requiring some rock hopping to traverse, which slowed my pace. I made my decision... finishing Maryland today (another 12mi) wasn't worth it, so I called and setup my extraction at the next major road crossing (4mi ahead) and then stopped to enjoy my clementine and the next shelter while I killed some time. 
It was an easy hike the rest of the way to the road and just before crossing I found TRAIL MAGIC of a couple gallons of fresh water left for hikers. I didn't partake because I'd soon be picked up, but especially on a day as hot as this the thought was appreciated. I changed into camp clothes, hopeful (mostly in vain) that it might improve my smell, until TopBunk arrived and we headed home.
I'm planning on getting back on trail Tuesday and don't intent to cover my activities at home in this journal, so there will be a couple day gap.","Crampton Gap Shelter
",Foxville Rd,"Jun 09, Fri",22
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568798,"I started my morning off with a shower (showering daily is a very nice perk of normal life) and then headed out (in my car). I grabbed breakfast at a diner with Classy during which we got to catch up on recent happenings over the past 3 weeks after the end of her LASH (Long Ass Section Hike).
After breakfast I went food shopping, realizing upon arriving that I had no idea where my next resupply would be. Glancing at AWOL, there were towns I could resupply at almost daily, so I just grabbed some food (since most food comes in fixed sizes, ie 8 granola bars per box, 6 oatmeal per box, etc) and a couple dinners and called it good.
While home I had made a couple minor gear swaps... I got a new food bag (same model) since my current one had 4 holes in it and wasn't really waterproof anymore. I traded my raincoat for a light weight shell since I hadn't used the rain jacket in a couple weeks and only wanted a windbreak layer. I also got rid of my old peanut butter jar water scoop and cut the bottom off my old smartwater bottle to use as a scoop.
The weather this weekend had been in the mid 90s each day which was bad enough in the modern world with AC, so I was very glad to have not been on trail this weekend. Today was supposed to be the last day in the 90s and then it's supposed to cool down a bit, which will be more bearable. This weather is good motivation to get farther north where the summers are cooler and less humid.
I got dropped back at the trail at 1pm and headed out, unsure of how far I'd end up going today. When I got dropped off it was 91deg, and I was sweating even before I had walked away from the car. Yay summer...
I headed uphill from the road and after a couple miles came to Raven Rocks (which didn't have much of a view) and then the shelter, which was super nice. It had stained hardwood floors, a fire pit with benches, a covered table, and even glass windows on the second floor. I cooled off for a few minutes before moving on, the rest of Maryland was all downhill from here!
I stopped at high rocks and admired the view, both of the landscape below and of the layers upon layers of graffiti which covered every rock and tree in sight. There are some downsides to places being road accessible...
The downhill to Penn Marr park was pretty rocky, which slowed progress, but eventually I arrived and took a bit of a break, sitting in the pavilion and watching the landscape. Unfortunately the concession stand was closed today, so I couldn't get a treat, but fresh off my long weekend I wasn't dying for one either. Though the park had water I didn't bother filling up since I probably wouldn't like the taste and there was a steam coming up shortly. A hiker was bringing his buddy who had apparently just finished the 4 state challenge and was extremely dehydrated some water, but he was well looked after so I moved on.
Just down the hill and across the train tracks I came to the MD/PA state line marking the completion of my 6th state of the 14 total. I crossed the Mason Dixon line and moved into PA, finally in the ""North""! 
The afternoon was still scorchingly hot, so much so that even the stream that I drew water from wasn't very cold. I crossed PA16 and after a little while longer came to a multitude of blazes pointing in non-sensical directions. I got a bit lost for a second before managing to find a blaze correlated with the actually path worn into the dirt. I noticed that most of the blazes we're a bit messy... it looks like someone painted gaps in the tree's bark with a white substance (perhaps to protect them from insects or something?). With more careful inspection it's not hard to distinguish real blazes, which are rectangular and at eye height, so I continued on.
I stopped at Deer Lick shelter and had my lunch at 5pm while I chatted with some section hikers tending their fire. I also figured out why AWOL had started pluralizing ""Shelters"" and indicating a capacity of ""2x4"" in the guide... This shelter was actually 2 small shelters side by side. Neat!
I moved on, the next couple miles coming easily. I stopped at Antietum shelter to get some water and accidentally slipped into the stream while filling my Sawyer bag... I mean, decided to cool my feet off by stepping in the stream. Whoops. At least my shoes will dry as I walk. 
I headed up to Tumbling Run shelter and stopped in to talk to Ontario and Goddess, who I had last seen halfway through Shenandoah, for a few minutes. This shelter was setup similarly to the last, 2 shelters side by side, but at this shelter one building was labeled for snorers and one was reserved for non snorers. Now that's useful!
 I was kinda at an awkward milage... 29 miles to Pine Grove Furnace and the half gallon challenge, which was a very long day. If I did a shorter day I'd hit the park early in the morning the next day and I had no desire to eat that much ice cream for breakfast. Doing a couple more tonight would put me in range of the park tomorrow, so that's what I decided to do. I tanked up on water for the night, there was no water for the next 7mi if I wanted to camp and the next shelter's water was 0.5mi downhill anyways. 
Heading uphill with full water was definitely harder than with a lighter pack, but not as bad as it had been climbing up the Chestnut Knob shelter for whatever reason. I stopped at Chimney rocks and chatted with Gotcha, an injured thru hiker turned section hiker, for a couple minutes and enjoyed the view. It wasn't spectacular, just eastward over to the next ridge, but with the exception of the rumble of a motorcycle in the valley before it was peaceful as the sun started to set. I had some dinner and then reluctantly moved on. I was tempted to stay here, but the 1.3mi I had hiked didn't really improve my milage situation and it was supposed to rain overnight which would obscure any stars I might see and sunrise tomorrow. At 830pm I hit the trail again, headlamp at the ready. I managed to hike until about 930 with the fading light of day before the risk of tripping on the rocky trail became too great and I had to turn on artificial light.
As they always do, the miles seemed to pass slower in the dark. After passing a road I found myself in a relatively thick bank of fog, surprising since the temperature hadn't changed or anything... Until I realized that I was walking through the remenants of the dust cloud left by the headlights I had watched drive down the road a couple minutes before I had gotten there. I crossed another couple roads before heading up onto another ridge which pretty quickly became unpleasantly rocky (though I suppose I shouldn't be surprised with a name like Rocky Mountain). As I walked I ended up scaring off a couple of... large things... which I didn't linger long enough to identify.
I finally reached the shelters a little after 10pm and since the tenting area wasn't immediately obvious (in the pitch black, anyways), I decided to just sleep in the shelter tonight. As quietly as I could I had a quick dinner and setup my gear in one of the shelters next to the other occupant before dropping off to sleep.
I did trade a few texts with Lookout today. The original plan was that, since both Lookout and I would be off trail for similar amounts of time, we would hike while the other was off trail and hopefully end up relatively close to each other when we both got back on. Well, for whatever reason, Lookout didn't make very many miles while I was off trail this weekend and tonight I'm only about 3mi from where he got off trail for the next 5 days, which means that by the time he gets back on the 18th I'll be 80-100mi ahead of him. That's a lot of distance, so if we meet back up it probably won't be for at least a couple hundred miles, so for now I'm solo (but not alone, not even if you only count people I already know, as meeting up with Ontario and Goddess earlier today should demonstrate). Should be an adventure... I'm not entirely sure who's in front of me, so we'll see who I meet/catch up with!","Foxville Rd
",Rocky Mountain Shelter,"Jun 13, Tue",23.40
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568799,"I know that I shouldn't complain since I decided to sleep in the shelter, but I figured my odds of an ok experience were pretty good with only one other occupant. My shelter-mate woke up at 5am and immediately pulled out his little radio and proceeded to spend 30min trying to tune into non-existant radio stations, never managing to get a static-free music station.
By 6 I couldn't take it anymore and it wasn't worth pulling out earplugs at that point, so I just got up and tried to get moving as soon as I could. I wasn't moving particularly fast this morning, stopping to chat with Primo, Patches, and Marshmallow who had all tented last night. I was happy to have finally caught Marshmallow, who zeroed in Luray after I had seen her in Shenendoah (which is why I didn't see her again), and to thank her for the Pepto she gave me while I was sick... It allowed me to eat just enough to keep going and it's now something I carry with me just in case.
I hit the trail (before radio dude, I might add) and while the temperature had dropped a bit, it had remained just as humid overnight as it had been yesterday and so even climbing the hill to get back to the trail had me sweating again. Probably ought to get used to it, I guess.
The trail down to PA30 wasn't hard but I did see some more fake-blazes as I walked. I stopped to get some water at Caledonia state park but the pool and snack stand wouldn't open until 11, another 3 hours, and so I just moved on after taking advantage of their bathroom facilities. Not far up the trail I came to Quarry Gap shelter, another extremely nice shelter that had flower pots, a swing, a bear box, a sundial, and multiple covered picnic tables. I enjoyed a snack on the swing before heading out, again grabbing water to make up for the water the heat was stealing from me.
If you hit it at the right season, Caledonia has some great blueberries on the powerlines that run through the park, but unfortunately they weren't ripe yet. I met a family out for a couple days of hiking who offered me some filtered water as we chatted, which I took them up on. 
The next section of trail was flat and easy hiking so I was cruising, just a mile or two from where I'd take lunch when my snake senses started tingling. Sure enough, right there in the trail was the first rattler of my hike. Later identified as a timber rattler, he was probably 3ft long and pretty thick, striped with varying colors of brown and tan. I actually saw him and reacted a couple feet  before I reached him, before he even felt threatened by my presence. Apparently content to sit there, it wasn't until I started trying to shoe him off the trail with my poles than he got a bit annoyed, coiling his neck and rattling as he slithered into the woods, leaving my way clear. Thankfully I only have a couple more states until I get too far north for rattlesnakes, but seeing as this is my first encounter they haven't been a huge issue thus far.
I took lunch at Birch Gap Shelter, the site of my first night out with DCUL, and took a nap for a while to let my feet rest and to give me time to rehydrate. Back on the trail, it wasn't long until I had played out my homefield advantage, reaching the northern extent of my previous hikes and venturing out into new territory. It wouldn't be until Vermont that I'd see familiar terrain again, from my End-to-end hike of the Long Trail last fall.
Not long after I reached the HALFWAY POINT of the trail for this year! I had hiked 1094.9mi already and had another 1094.9mi to go until Mt Katahdin in Maine and the completion of the whole 2189.8mi Appalachian Trail. But let's not count our chickens yet. That large a goal is a little too large for me to visualize, so right now I'm just headed to Duncannon, and then the New Jersey, and then New York, and so on...
Anyways, it was a little funny, the halfway point moves each year as the length of the trail changes slightly due to reroutes, so the actual halfway point is just marked with a little paper sign. This year, about 4mi after the paper sign, I came across the big fancy wooden sign that was erected in 2011 to mark the halfway point that year but that is apparently too hard to move each year. The paper sign had a picture of the wooden sign but with this year's milages on it... A little preview of what's to come. Also, fun fact, apparently the trail has gotten 7.8mi longer since 2011.
The rest of the afternoon was pretty sunny and hot as the miles ticked by. I ran into Indy, who Lookout, Classy, and I had first met south of Damascus as he handed us a beer and made us fresh pancakes at the trail magic he and some buddies were doing. This time he was wearing a ridgerunner uniform and weedwacking to reclaim a part of the trail from the spring growth. We didn't chat long, but not far after I ran into a cooler he had left full of ice cold drinks. I got the last beer (plenty of sodas left for those who like them!) which I enjoyed as I hiked on towards Pine Grove Furnace.
Pine Grove Furnace is home to the Half Gallon challenge, a hiking contest of will where the participants attempt to eat an entire half gallon of ice cream, usually in less than an hour. I started strong, finishing a carton of moose tracks ice cream without trouble before being informed that these days cartons are only 1.5quarts and that I had to eat another pint to complete the challenge. I went for a pint of cookie dough, which was not nearly as easy as the carton my stomach started to protest whatever the hell was going on. I did finish, with a time of 52min, and joined the half gallon club (which has a special trail log than only members can sign) and received a little wooden spoon as a reward. Not a bad 3000 calorie dinner...
I moved on, passing a beach on a small lake where a couple families were enjoying their last swim of the day, wishing that I had hit this earlier in the afternoon when it would be nice to swim. It was a little bit of an interesting feeling, strolling past these people going about their normal lives and enjoying the lake on a typical afternoon as I headed back into the woods for who knows how long, not sure of who I'll be hanging out with as I continue the trail.
I was planning on camping just after the camping restrictions around Pine Grove were no longer in effect, but as I reached the first campsite I still had a few hours of daylight left and so I decided to push on. Plus, with the amount of ice cream I just ate, having a privy tonight wouldn't be the worst thing...
I found some bonus water (not marked in AWOL) and so grabbed some water from the pool under the slow trickle coming out of the rocks. The flow was so low that I depleted the pool as I filled my bottle via my scoop.
The miles didn't come very quickly, the ice cream weighing me down, as the sun set and dusk started to set it. A couple of rocky sections slowed me down a bit and didn't feel great on my already sore feet, but as I descended off the ridge the sun backlit the adjacent ridge as it sank down and day started yielding to night. I really didn't want to stop to get my headlamp out of my pack, but thankfully I pulled into camp just as my night vision was starting to be inadequate. 
The hikers had a fire going, which I was glad for as it would keep them awake a bit later so that I could meet/chat with them. I quickly setup camp, pitching my tent and throwing my bear line, before running up the 0.3mi to the shelter to use the privy. The shelter was empty... the spring at the shelter was dry, making the river back down at the AT the only water source and so making the shelter not worth the extra walk to most hikers.
Just as I got back to camp the rest of the hikers decided to douse the fire and head to bed, which I was a little disappointed about until I realized that I probably wouldn't have been able to keep my eyes open anyways, a wave of tiredness hitting me as the hiking adrenaline wore off. I crawled into my tent, rainfly fully open to try to get some airflow. Even so, every time I moved I seemed to break out into sweat... It was so hot that I wasn't even able to use my sleeping bag liner, nevermind my quilt... Hopefully this isn't what the whole summer is going to be...","Rocky Mountain Shelter
",Tagg Run Shelter,"Jun 14, Wed",30.10
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568800,"I got up late... I woke up at 530 with the sun and then rolled over until 7. On the trail it wasn't long until I hit a road that AWOL said had a store and deli 0.2mi down it, so I took a right and headed that way. The store was nice, I got a breakfast sandwich to add some extra calories to my breakfast and picked up a new roll of TP (I was low and that's not a good thing you run out of). It's annoying, a roll of TP is just barely too large to fit in a quart sized sandwhich bag. #hikerproblems #irealizehashtagsdontworkhere
The next couple miles of trail weren't hard, but the heat was brutal and it felt like I was melting. My backpack started chafing my lower back, my shorts started chafing, my shoulders started to get rubbed raw from my backpack straps... It wasn't fun. Taking a look at AWOL, I had a new terrain feature coming up, a ""Rock Maze"", which was potentially ominous sounding. It turned out to be partially fun and partially annoying, the trail wound back and forth through a bunch of large boulders with arrows pointing the way in most places. Navigating the labyrinth required a couple of mild scrambles which were fun, but there were obvious side trails where people had bypassed obstacles... Not cool people.
I stopped at the shelter for a lunch break, enjoying... well, eating, my PB and KitKat tortilla, in solitude. Leaving the shelter committed me to either hike another 18mi or stay in a town, as camping was prohibited on the next section of trail and there were no shelters. Even if those restrictions hadn't been in place I probably would've ended up doing a 26mi day anyways, but it is a little bit annoying to be forced to do that many miles.
I set out, and not long after I reached Halfway knob, apparently the original halfway point of the AT. I took a picture of the plack embedded in the boulder and then moved on, not much to see with the trees as dense as they were. The trail descended down into Cumberland valley and started winding it's way through fields, taking long rectangular paths around instead of through the crops. 
It wasn't long before the trail started crossing more roads and a couple buildings, and it wasn't until I was almost in town that I realized I was entering a town and should probably redon my shirt. Boiling Springs appears to be home to an unusual number of fly fishermen who were wandering the banks and bridges across the river coming into town. The town is centered around a lake, only a couple of feet deep and filled with crystal clear teal water, apparently fed by hundreds of springs ""boiling"" up from the ground which had been redirected to form the lake.
I stopped by the ATC center there and grabbed a muffin and an ice cream cookie-wich from a gas station and kept moving. Before I left town I came across TRAIL MAGIC of a cooler full of ice cold drinks on the side of the road. I chugged a Gatorade and chatted with 2 SOBOs as they did the same before continuing on my way. 
The trail continued to wind through fields and then duck back into narrow strips of trees which seperated them, but both were very warm under the afternoon sun. The trail, hard packed mud/dirt as hard as concrete, was tougher than I expected on my feet and I stopped a couple of times just to get off my feet. Though I passed multiple streams I couldn't/didn't fill up as all the agricultural runoff wouldn't be removed by my filter, so I rationed my water as best I could as I treked on.
I crossed I-81 and I-76 and I won a staredown with a group of playful cows... Well, I assumed playful, but they could've also been mating... Either way, not something I wanted to be a part of... and as I crossed the stile out of the pasture was treated to some fresh mulberries.
The next couple miles were pretty uneventful... I had to lug 3L of water up the other side of the valley because the next shelter had unreliable water, but I finally arrived at about 6pm, grateful to be at camp before dark. Zorba, Chops, and Gray Eagle (hikers I had met in Shenendoah) and Walkie Talkie (who I had met in MD) were already at the shelter and we all agreed that the Cumberland (Death) Valley was not the most fun section of trail we had done.
I decided it was a 3 ramen night and supplemented them with olive oil and a couple tortillas to round out the meal. This shelter is apparently known for it's privy, called the Taj Mahal (presumably because of how large the building was), but it really wasn't anything special and I'm kinda starting to wonder who comes up with these names.
Tomorrow I'm aiming for Duncannon, only about 12mi away, and then am going to take the rest of the day off and enjoy town. I'm thinking I'm going to try to do this sort of thing at least once a week because it allows me to still make some miles but also to get a full half day of rest in, which I think my body will need. Also, I'm thinking I might redefine a nero as any day where I finish hiking by 12 or 1pm, because I don't really ever do any days which meet the old definition (<~10mi) anymore. Also, whereas the terrain is going to be getting harder, milage is not the best indicator anyways, so we'll see how this new definition works.","Tagg Run Shelter
",Darlington Shelter,"Jun 15, Thu",26.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568924,"We got a little rain last night, so I had to close my rain fly (which I had left open for ventilation) at ~1130pm. I initially woke up at 530, but as I usually do these day, I rolled over and went back to bed until 7. When I finally did get up I had my 2 oatmeals for breakfast (which I may have to look into changing... they're getting old at this point) and loaded the rest of my snacks into my hipbelts for the day. My food bag empty except for a spare dinner, I packed up and headed out.
Not far down the trail I passed a trough with dirty/brackish water in it, perhaps a remnant of when this land was used for livestock. The water was something I would never drink on the AT but probably a perfectly good PCT water source. I hiked through several fields of wild flowers, various white and purple blooms sprinkled throughout. I passed some blackberry bushes, their fruit just turning red and would hopefully be fully ripe in not too long.
I would learn later that I missed trail magic at one of the road crossing, yet again showing the folly of leaving camp ""early"". The trail crossed a small stream, the last on-trail water for the next 7mi into Duncannon, so I grabbed a liter as I chatted with a couple of Kiwis (whose trail names I forget).
AWOL (which I should perhaps explain is my shorthand way of referring to the AT guide that I'm using, written by a guy named AWOL) warned that the next 7mi of trail into town were rocky, but although there were some rockier sections, it wasn't really too bad. In talking later, we'd decide that he was just trying to psych us up for the really rocky sections of trail that we'd face coming up, but we'll see.
While walking and listening to music I came across a particularly appropriate song lyric...
""For once, once in your lifeFor once push your ambitions asideAnd instead of moving mountainsLet the mountains move you""
I like it... thought it fit my current lifestyle... thought I'd share.
Anyways, the trail eventually came to a rocky outcrop from which I could see Duncannon spread out below as well as the massive girth of the Susquehanna River winding through the valley it had cut. On the other side of the river, a highway (that I've driven many times to get to hiking trails in northern PA) wound along the bank and the horns of trains could be heard eminating from both shores. I found Zorba at the overlook and we chatted for a while about various things... Our plans for after the trail, how quick the trail was flying by now, and how he had almost left trail to go pursue some other adventures but figured that he might as well finish now that we're so close (in thru hiker terms at least). Eventually he decided to move on and I lingered for a few extra minutes until I was joined by Aaron, who had hiked this section before and have me a couple tips about Duncannon (ie, don't stay at the Doyle, how to find the new church hostel in town, about the shuttle to the grocery store, etc).
I pushed on, wanting to get into town in time to get lunch and started down a set of very steep rocky steps built into the loose rock on the hillside. As I descended the hill felt so steep that I could almost see down the chimneys of the houses below. As I was nearing the bottom the full force of town assaulted my nose, the aroma of cars and trains and pollution hitting me at once in a not very pleasant way.
Walking into town I caught up with Zorba and Chops and we set about finding the hostel. This hostel only opened a couple weeks ago and so wasn't in AWOL. It turns out that the fact that the hostel is in a church doesn't narrow things down too much when there are 8 churches in town, so eventually we ended up asking the fire station for directions.
The hostel is located on the trail as it passes through town along High St, in the basement of a church with a large ""hikers welcome"" sign out front. The downstairs is a large room that had a kitchen along one side, a bathroom, and a couple of hikers already spread out on it. They do Sunday school down here and so ask the hikers to vacate early on Sunday mornings, but otherwise give us the run of the place in exchange for us keeping it clean.
We got cleaned up and then headed downtown again, stopping by the Doyle for some food. Though the building may be historic, in my opinion it's dirtiness and run down appearance has drained alot of it's charm. Inside, the walls were somewhat stained from the days that smoking was permitted indoors (which was a while ago...)  and the walls were adorned with alien paraphinalia and a show about aliens played on the TV in the corner. It certainly had a unique vibe... But the food and beer were cheap, so whatever. 
We were going to wait for the 4pm shuttle up to the grocery store, but we had a couple hours until then, so we headed across the street to a pretzel shop because they advertised cotton candy and Zorba had been craving some. The lady warned us that it took 15min for the machine to warm up, but we had nothing but time to kill, so that wasn't a problem. As we waited we chatted with her and heard about the town politics... But I won't get into that here.
As we waited she gave us some peanut butter fudge that she had made that morning when she was bored and then the machine was finally ready. She told us about how the first time she had made it the cotton candy had flown everywhere faster than they could bag it, handed Zorba a paper cone, told him to get ready, and dumped the sugar in. Immediately strands of blue silk started flying up out of the center and he frantically waved his wand through the air attempting to catch it all. She repeated the process with each of us, dumping in a couple scoops of sugar so that we each ended up with a cloud of cotton candy bigger than our head. She was laughing the entire time and at the end she wouldn't accept money for it, having had fun watch us make it ourselves. 
After that we headed home (for the night, anyways) and all took a nap for about an hour until it was time for the store. We caught the shuttle (run by whoever the store had on staff was available at 4) and managed to fit 8 hikers in the minivan. I shopped and met up with the others waiting out front of the store for everyone to finish, when I noticed that Zorba had found a box of giant eclairs. Regret struck immediately and I headed back into the store, returning with my own eclairs and some extra fruit to snack on. We caught the shuttle back the ~1mi down to town and then headed back to the hostel.
This hostel is awesome! and the pastor also provides dinner daily, tonight was delivery pizza which we all enjoyed. After dinner I just chilled, catching up on internet and hanging out with the others. I found a tiny bottle of lotion in the hiker box and I used it on my feet... GAME CHANGER... it's so good. My feet were so dry and hard and the lotion makes them feel infinitely better. Definitely packing this out.
In other news, Jesus (who is apparently a hiker, who knew!) is staying here at the church with us tonight, so that's special. Also, I might end up staying a night with Slipper's sister next week when I get up towards the end of PA, which would be cool. We'll see!","Darlington Shelter
",Duncannon,"Jun 16, Fri",11.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569386,"The church hostel was really nice... the air conditioning was heavenly last night, but the concrete floor (even covered in carpet) was pretty hard and not great to sleep on. I'll have to find a nice patch of grass for tonight. 
The dinner 2 nights ago had been pulled pork, so for breakfast this morning we had pork hash, watermelon, and toasted leftover hamburger buns for breakfast. Two of the hikers here started on March 1st, a month before I did, which is pretty cool. I'm moving along pretty well!
Walkie, Zorba, Chops, and I headed down to the AT festival. The town had closed down a street and there were a bunch of tents setup with various vendors and organizations setup, live blacksmithing demonstrations, a couple of hiking groups advertising the local trails, some conservation groups, a band (Roger Hammer Music) who played an AT song, and more. I picked up a free bandanna from one of the booths which will replace the one Slipper stole out of my cook set and tried to get some BBQ at the nearby store, but they had recently relocated to the other end of town, so I settled for a steak and cheese with tomato sauce on it, an interesting combo.
At the festival I ran into Patches and Primo, who had just walked into town and I passed on the word about the church hostel. The festival's activities exhausted, we headed back to the church to hang out in the AC  and charge my phone.
Taking a look at AWOL before I left, the rest of PA looks pretty terrible in terms of water availablity and campsites, but it does look super flat, so we'll have to see how rocky it is. I hit the trail at 1230 amid foggy skies. The fog meant that the humidity was super high but upside was that there was no sun, which kept the temperature a little cooler than it otherwise might've been, only in the 80s. I didn't make it far, not even out of town, before I stopped at Road Hawg BBQ for some lunch where I got TRAIL MAGIC! HighTech ('91) bought my lunch and so I hung out with him and talked about the trail... the sections he had done since, how the trail has changed since he hiked, which was cool. 
Finally I could delay no more, and finally started walking. I followed the trail as it crossed a long bridge over the Susquehanna River and then up the cliff on other side of river. Reaching the top, I crossed the Susquehanna trail, tanked up on water for the next dry section, and then headed out. It was magic... cresting the ridge the noise from the highways disappeared over the course of 5 steps and I was left with the gentle patter of rain. The magic was a little short lived as the sounds of humanity returned a little farther down the trail, the river and the highways running in opposite directions on each side of the ridge that I was hiking. A couple powerlines, impervious to the hill, cut straight across the landscape and the ridge continued eastward as the river curved away and headed south.
The afternoon started to stretch on, the sun having returned and heating up the afternoon. Most of the trail was at least a little bit rocky at this point, small rocks embedded into the dirt and poking up at the most painful angles, which didn't help the situation. I stopped at table rock to take in the view, the adjacent ridge and valley between fully wooded and devoid of human structures.
I made it to the shelter which marked the 10mi mark for the day and decided that I had a few more miles in me. This was the last shelter for 18mi, so passing it meant that I was definitely stealth camping tonight. Down off the ridge, across a road, and back up the next ridge.
I ran into a spring that I had been hoping would be my water for the night, but while the water was clear the stream bed was florescent orange. I decided that that wasn't the right color for a stream, and though it was probably just iron in the water or something, I didn't trust it and grudgingly moved on. Coming up to the top of the ridge I heard the distant report of gunfire, high caliber stuff emitting deep thuds as they fired. The amount of gunfire was a bit unsettling, it would be go for minutes and then pause for about 10min and repeat. With that quantity it seemed like it had to be a military base or something doing training, but I was in state game lands and so I didn't know if it might've also been just a bunch of rednecks having way too much fun (with waaay heavier weapons than they should've had), which was a scarier concept.
I passed a nice campsite, complete with a bed of pine needles and stone chairs around a fire pit built inbetween the pilings leftover from an old firetower. Without water I couldn't camp, so I had to push on as the sun dropped towards the horizon and dusk set it. I came to a spring that AWOL said should be reliable and flowing, but it wasn't, the first time I had had that happen. There were a couple of puddles left, and the next spring was another 5mi away with would turn into a night hike, so I said screw it and filled up.
This was really the first time I've ever been uncomfortable on the AT. The gunfire was so loud directly ahead that any farther and it sounded like I'd be in the middle of a shooting range. Had I had cell service and could've ascertained if the source of the fire was legit, I would've been alot more comfortable, but alas, I was cutoff from the internet and AWOL was mute on anything in this area. I searched my AT bucket list (and life bucket list) and couldn't find wandering through gunfire in the dark anywhere on it, so I did something I've yet to do... I walked south.
Back to the campsite! I got there just after the sun set and had a couple minutes of light to setup my tent and start dinner. I decided that today was a triple ramen kinda night and ate as night fell, heading to bed my bed of pine needles shortly after.
Long day today, but still did a full day's miles despite having left town after noon, which I'm pretty happy about. While in town I had posted on Facebook about hitting the halfway point on the trail and got a number of comments back, including an offer for a place to stay once I get up to NH, which is pretty cool.","Duncannon
",HorseShoe trail junction,"Jun 17, Sat",21
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569389,"Last night was a bit interesting. I woke up at ~11 to something sniffing and shuffling around outside my tent... not what I wanted to deal with while camping alone. I got up and poked my head out of the tent, headlamp illuminating the night, and found 2 porqupines hanging around. Ok... Could be worse. I yelled at them and they waddled away, problem solved. Until they came back. And again.
After the 3rd time I just gave up yelling at them as I drifted back to sleep. I woke up again at ~3am and had to close my rain fly due to some light rain and they were still hanging around, but they weren't doing anything... So, whatever?
Morning eventually came and in packing up camp I found a single quill lodged in the loose end of my bear line. I'll take that as the porqupine seal of approval!
I hit the trail at 720 to the sound of silence... no gunfire. It didn't take me long to cover the distance I had hiked back last night and start covering some new ground, and sure enough the trail took a 90deg turn as it came to whatever land the gunfire was happening on. I had figured that would happen, but wasn't worth the risk. However, at 8am, to the minute, the fire restarted, echoing through the woods. 
The trail was pretty easy, long, flat, and pretty straight, crossing various short rocky sections, but otherwise uneventful. Near the next shelter I hiked across some black soil and rock down, maybe something unique gelogically about this region? 
Just past the shelter I came to a trail reroute where a bridge across a stream had washed out. 2 excavators were on site to effect repairs, but were currently vacant. I headed down an embankment off of the road the trail had been following, down a very new trail that was obvious had been cleared very recently from the remains of brush and be stumps present. This new trail had me hop from boulder to boulder over a lively stream and then rejoined the AT a short distance later. 
I climbed up and then back down a mountain, crossed a couple of bustling roads, and took my lunch break at a stream which helped to mask some of the noise from the roads around me. With all these roads everywhere once I got off the mountain, I thought it interesting to see how topography constrains human infrastructure into valleys.
I used a massive and very old steel truss bridge to cross a river and canal and then just up the gravel road crossed under I-81 (for the second and last time), the cars and trucks above me causing the bridge up hum as they crossed over. The trail headed back up onto a ridge that had alternating sections of extremely rocky, boulder-hopping terrain and super flat cruising terrain. 
While up here I started to here thunder in the distance and steeled myself for rain, but except for a sprinkle, it never arrived. The thundersun continued for a while but never arrived, perhaps a storm was visiting a nearby ridge, but I couldn't tell because of the dense foliage. The best part of the weird weather was it stirred up a bit of a breeze which cooled things off a little bit during the afternoon.
The afternoon stretched on as the rocks came and went. I'm not really planning on doing a countdown, but I did pass the 1000mi-to-go mark, which is pretty exciting.
I knew that my home for the night, 501 shelter, was just past a view, but once again AWOL and I had different ideas as to what constituted a view and several overlooks later I stumbled out onto the road for which the shelter was named. The shelter was just a bit farther, right next to the caretakers house. I arrived and set my stuff down as the caretaker was talking to a couple of hikers, MaryPoppins, and 2 others. They were just finishing eating a couple pizzas and offered me 2 slices, which I gladly accepted. The shelter was a large shed that contained bunks, a picnic table, and a HUGE domed skylight and the facility also had a solar shower and fresh water located outside, charging outlets on the side of the caretaker's house, and a portapotty (the cleanest I've ever seen).
Feeling a little grungy compared to the other hikers who had arrived earlier, I headed for the shower. The shower was just a garden hose attached to an elevated barrel which had been painted black, but being located in the forest, the sun didn't have much of a chance to warm the water, so the shower was brisk. Unfortunately it seemed like my clothes were just as smelly as I was at this point, so given the lack of laundry facilities here, I decided to combine my chores and do my shower and laundry at the same time... with the hose.
After cleaning up, I called down to the local pizza place and ordered pizza (since the shelter was only 0.1mi from the road) and they knew just where to deliver it. I couldn't quite finish the whole pizza (I blame having already eaten 2 slices earlier) so I saved a couple slices for breakfast and hit the hay as hiker midnight rolled around.","HorseShoe trail junction

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569522,"I was up early this morning and packed up and had some breakfast. In case you were curious, I'm totally over with Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal... at this point the flavor is like being hit over the head with a maple tree and then someone pouring brown sugar down my throat. It's was too strong and artificial be to enjoyable... Or edible. My first day having it I figured that I didn't really like the flavor and probably wouldn't buy it again... at this point I would burn it I weren't going to waste away without the calories. /rant
I hit the trail early, by about 6am, since I had a fair number of miles to do before getting off trail and staying at a friend's place tonight. The hiking was easy to start and followed a forest road for the first couple miles. As rocky as PA is, these forest roads provide a nice break from them every once in a while and make it bearable.
I passed a road with a restaurant just a little ways from the trail and I walked up to check it out, but the restaurant isn't open on Wednesdays, so I was out of luck for getting some breakfast. I left the busy road behind and soon the trail hopped back onto another forest road, allowing me to cruise along until I reached the appropriately named, Knifes Edge. A slanted slab of rock jutting up from the top of the ridge, it took some scrambling to navigate the rocks while taking in the countryside below. Up on the ridge it was a little breezy, a welcome change from the heat and humidity of the past couple days and clouds kept the sun off of me.
Back on more forest roads again, while digging through my hip belts for a snack I was a bit lost in thought and was not expecting to see a man walking his dog on the trail. We chatted for a few moments before heading our separate ways, but it wasn't until the next road crossing (about 10min farther) that I realized my phone wasn't in my hipbelt like it was supposed to be. My phone is pretty critical, since it's obviously a pretty pricey piece of gear, is my only means of communications, and also has my trail guide on it. I immediately turned around and double-timed it back to the point where I had met the man-dog and was immensely relieved to find my phone sitting in the trail, exactly where it had fallen. Another lesson... don't overstuff pockets such that things fall out. 
I climbed over a rocky mountain summit and took a quick lunch break at the shelter on the other side before continuing on. Just as I hit the trail another hiker came down the mountain and was only a little ways behind me. I tried to outrun him, to escape the annoying click of his poles, but no matter what I did I couldn't hike fast on the rocks to give him the slip. I eventually just gave up and let him pass, which was a good thing because not long after I came to an exposed section of trail with tons (figuratively, but perhaps literally as well...) of blueberries. There were far too many to pick, but I did my best to get all of the ones in easy reach for the next mile or two of trail, which took long enough that it put me behind schedule. The berries were super sweet and delicious, far sweeter than what you can find in stores, and still had a lovely tanginess of being the first of the season. 
I was apparently so engrossed in the berries that I didn't even notice walking over a highway which tunneled under the ridge I was walking on. Pretty cool that someone decided it was easier to just go through the ridge rather than around it. I took another quick lunch break at the next shelter as I worked my way through the rocky descent into Lehigh Gap.
Emerging onto a bridge, I got my first good view of the other side of the gap, a very steep, rocky mountain that I had to go up. First though, I got some TRAIL MAGIC from Ragwart ('16) who had driven up from FL to this spot because when he hiked he hadn't gotten any trail magic in the entire state of PA and was planning on being here for 5 days to make sure that didn't happen to other hikers. I was their first hiker and ended up eating 4 chilli dogs over the hour that I ended up staying before I decided that I really needed to get going.
I powered up the first part of the hill until I was forced to slow down to choose my hand and foot holds carefully. For some sections I had to throw my poles up onto the ledge above and then climb up after them and for other sections I was hopping between boulders as I tried to follow the white blazes.  I was feeling pretty good, having fun with the scrambles and powering up (or perhaps, crushing...) the hill when, well, I'm not sure exactly what happened... The rock moved or my pole slipped, but I was falling forward. I managed to catch myself... mostly... my upper arm ended up catching the rest of me against a shelf of rock and getting a pretty nasty looking, but entirely superficial cut. I also got a nick on each shin and one on the forearm, but was otherwise fine. One of my water bottles (the full one) also slipped out of my pack and disappeared down in between the rocks, never to be seen again. Losing the water was pretty unfortunate because I was heading into the Palmerton Zinc Mine Cleanup Superfund site and the only water for the next 6mi was labeled toxic due to heavy metal contamination, but with a thunderstorm moving in I didn't have much choice but to move on while taking a lesson to be more careful.
Just as I reached the top the rain started so I stopped, battened down the hatches and donned my pack cover, and continued on. The rain was short lived and stopped soon after as I headed onto the (semi-permanent) reroute around the Superfund site. The site was in the process of being re-forested after mining activity had left the entire ridge incapable of supporting plant life. The reroute skirted to the side of the ridge, meaning that I had a great view to the west as I hiked. I watched that thunderstorm dump rain onto the next ridge over, the clouds merging with the ground, connected by torrents of rain and punctuated with occasional thunder. The storm was outpacing me, and I watched as it slowly pulled out ahead of me, rain still soaking the earth a couple miles to my west.
I think that this reroute is least rocky, dirtiest, easiest trail I've yet hiked in PA, and with the constant view it was like I was strolling through town, just 1000ft above the streets. I passed some blackberries having just ripened that were a little too far down the hill for me to reach and some dandelions bigger than my hand. 
The reroute eventually lead back up onto the ridge to rejoin the trail, which felt like a desert with the loose rocky terrain and the lack of water starting to affect me. I passed multitudes of blueberries, but restrained myself from eating (too many) because I wasn't sure how the contamination might've affected them. 
Finally ducking back into the woods, I met another hiker who offered me a sterile wipe for my arm, which by now had bled and dried in a rather gnarly (ie awesome) looking way. I cleaned it a bit, but left most of it to be taken care of off trail. It wasn't long until I reached the road and got picked up by my friend. My evening involved a shower, laundry, dinner (where I got a burger on a salad, best of both worlds!), resupply, FroYo, a mini wiskey tasting, and star gazing. Good day!
Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, today was the summer solstice, also known as hike naked day.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

",West Mountain Shelter,"Jun 28, Wed",22.80
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570390,"Ok, so cowboy camping on the roof of the shelter will probably not go down in history as my best idea, but it also wasn't my worst. Since the shelter's roof sloped low in the back it was pretty easy to get up and down from, and the pitch of the roof was slight enough that I could lay pretty comfortably. However sometime in the night the wind picked up and the temperature dropped and eventually the combination of factors just became unconducive enough to sleep that I called it quits and headed over to my tent which I had setup last night just for this scenario. It wasn't all bad though, over the multiple times I woke up in the night (which is very common for me out here) I got to enjoy the view of the city lighting up the sky to the south with it's tall towers pointing straight up onto the night, the rolling hills of the terrain to the south and the lights dotting the tops of the hills, the tiny red and green flashes of the navigation bouys on the Hudson, and a decent showing of stars above for being this close to the city. It was certainly a unique view thus far on the trail.
Morning came around and I was able to improve my oatmeal significantly with the addition of fresh mulberries from the tree in front of the shelter. After breakfast I took in the view one more time, the city having faded back into a haze by this time, and hit the trail.
While hiking I ran into Michaub, who had come into camp late last night and who I had run into a couple times at this point. I passed him and started up my ascent of Bear Mt. I managed to not slow down too much for the blueberry bushes that lined the trail, strategically grabbing a berry here and there as I hiked. 
The trail followed an old, cracked asphalt road for a time before turning and heading straight up a rocky staircase and crossing numerous large rock faces which had even been visible from an overlook earlier this morning. On one such rock face I ran into the 1400 mile marker, made from small stones and grass. If it hadn't been so distinctive against the backdrop of the rock I totally would've missed it, even after having seen it in AWOL this morning.
Michaub caught up to me at the summit and we headed down the other side of Bear Mt together, chatting about our real lives as we hiked. Down at the bottom we made a bee line over to Bear Mt lodge, a place that I felt severely underdressed and too smelly for, but who nonetheless welcomed hikers in their Hiker Cafe (but maybe not in their other restaurant, though it was never said). Turns out this place has a concession stand which sells most of the real food (burgers, hotdogs, chicken tenders, fries, etc) and didn't open for another hour, so we settled with a couple scoops of ice cream and started charging our gear. While there, Zorba and Shaggy also showed up, and I met ManEater while we both tried to convince the wifi to download our entertainment.
Hitting the trail again involved some stumbling through the picnic tables full of cookout food and resisting the urge to Yogi some more food until finally finding the trees, signposts, and trash cans that bore the blazes. Eventually they led to the only zoo on the trail. Hosting only non-releasable animals, this nature center focuses on the flora and fauna encountered on the AT in NY and is the only one of the 14 nature centers that the original idea for the AT envisioned to have been built. Passing a black bear lounging on a hammock in the sun I hit the lowest altitude on the AT of 177ft... all uphill from here!
The trail led up out of the zoo and onto a busy road which I followed over the Bear Mt bridge, the first vehicular bridge across the Hudson. It's towers jutted into the sky and thick cables supported the road and I crossed high above the river, with trains passing on both banks. On the other side, to no surprise, was a cliff, opposite in magnitude to our descent of Bear Mt, which I scurried up (though with a fair amount of effort... the terrain is getting steep again!) past a couple groups of day hikers heading up to the view. The AT cut off before said view, and just after the junction I ran into Moxie and TumbleWeed, who I hadn't seen since Bald Knob way back south of Shenendoah and the Priest. We caught up a bit before I moved on, covering the 6.8mi of ups and downs as efficiently as possible, until I came to the Appalachian Deli! I got another ice cream and ended up hanging out there for 1.5hr before finally getting up the energy to move at about 4pm. I almost stayed at the spiritual center just 0.9mi up the trail, which had a booming service going on and probably would've been an interesting experience, but would have only been a 13 mile day. I know it's not all about the miles, but I had to admit that that was a really short day and that I needed to be in Kent by Saturday to meet up with my family and take some time off trail. So I moved on.
The trail continued it's ups and downs and I hiked a couple more hours before coming up to Michaub who had setup camp across a small stream from the trail. He invited me to camp if I wanted to call it a day, which I did, so I setup myself and ate dinner, chatting for a while until dark fell and we headed to bed.","West Mountain Shelter

",Morgan Stewart Shelter,"Jun 30, Fri",21.60
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571201,"Last night it continued to rain on and off throughout the night and my tent became almost unbearably hot with the fly's all closed. I got on trail early, by 6am since I had  22mi to go before 2pm when I'd meet up with my mom and get off trail for the night.
The bugs were still out I'm force, still kamakazi-ing into my eyes whenever possible and buzzing around me as I hiked, but they don't seem to bite, so they're more of an annoyance than a problem. Nuclear lake (an ominous name that I didn't know the origin of... Maybe I shouldn't drink the water?) was very pretty in the morning sun, with the light reflecting off the still water near the shore and the small ripples caused by the wind in the center. A flock of geese were hanging out on the beach and took to the water as I approached to admire the scene, honking in protest.
The trail wound up and down over the rolling hills and I startled a fox, the first I had seen on the hike, who ran down the trail a ways before darting into the woods, too fast for my camera. The trail crossed a road of varying business every couple miles or so, evidence of the civilization I hiked past. I crossed several fields before coming to the AT train station, a train station on the trail from which one could directly into and out of NYC on the weekends. I watched an outbound train stop at the station before moving on.
Another hill, another ridge, and I was in Connecticut! The trail swung back into NY for a couple miles ahead, so I wasn't done with NY yet, but it was good to finally be in New England! It wasn't long after that that I met up with Mom at the top of Ten Mile Hill (I will point out that I did not receive a hug due to sweat) and we headed back to the car which was parked about 2mi up the trail along the Housatonic river.
I got a shower back at the hotel, we got dinner, headed to the grocery store for a resupply, and then I got to veg out on a bed all night and relax.
Sidenote, apparently the NJ state govt shutdown today over budget issues, which closes all the state parks, including the ones I got food at. Gad I made it through before that happened!","Morgan Stewart Shelter
",Bulls Bridge Rd,"Jul 01, Sat",21.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571207,"We got moving pretty late, which was perfectly fine by me, and stopped by Walmart so that I could pick up some wet wipes, a new pocket knife (I had apparently left mine at the last shelter yesterday. Ironically, I now have the same type of pocket knife I started the trip with), and a knee brace (to see if it would help prevent/mitigate my knee pain before it gets worse). I used the car ride to combine the individually wrapped wet wipes into a single ziplock, to reduce trash as we drove up to Kent, CT, despite the weird looks from my mom and brother. In Kent I needed to grab my maildrop box which my support friend, Slipper, had sent to the outfitter's in town. At the outfitter (which is combined with an ice cream store... Genius) I saw and exchanged greetings with Jaws, who had walked into town this morning, and then grabbed my package. I got new tips for my poles (since one of mine had completely worn away and would now slip on rocks), a new sit pad (since mine had blown off the fire tower in NJ, never to be seen again), some powered milk (to supplement my diet), and a couple of treats (a blueberry sour beer, some astronaut ice cream, and a bunch of candy).
We got lunch at a restaurant and wandered around the cute, stereotypical small town New England main street for a while (Kent seems to be pretty hiker friendly... They just installed a public restroom and shower in the middle of town) before jumping back in the car and heading south. Picking up my package with the car saved me from having to come into town when I passed Kent on the trail today. It was only a short drive back and after a couple minutes of repacking all the new gear into my bag (and dropping the beer on the pavement and cracking it open, necessitating that I chug it... tragedy...) I was back onto the trail and my mom and bro were headed to Maine to meet up with my sister for the long weekend. I was heading there too, but probably not in time for the long weekend...
As soon as I started walking the trail took a turn uphill, one steep enough that it immediately had me sweating and legs burning (which the hills had been doing more often as we continued north). It took me about an hour to top out, and it took me a while to shake the thought that my family had gone ~70mi in that time on the road, a much more efficient use of time. But then, it depends on how you define efficiency... or if efficiency is even the goal... and with those thoughts I was back into hiking mentality and cruising along. 
I passed to the trail's 2/3 mark, 1460mi from Springer Mt, GA, and accidentally chased a doe and fawn off the trail as I came through. Coming around onto the NY side of this hill I enjoyed the wonderful breeze which worked wonders towards cooling me down. As I started the descent I ran into Shaggy (who I'd been seeing on and off for the past couple days) and his family taking a break on the trail. I took them up on their offer of TRAIL MAGIC and scarfed down a brownie while chatting with them. Shaggy was headed home with them tonight and was going to zero there and get back on trail on the 4th, which would put him a little ways behind me. Moving on, I passed through a burned section of forest which had yet to fully recover, with only handfuls of plants dotting the slope. As the downhill started in earnest I donned my knee brace to try it out and found it quite restrictive to motion. Maybe that's the point, but it's not terribly comfortable, so it had better help enough to be worth it.
While filling up on water I passed a group of girls from a local summer camp out for a 3 night adventure, and then ran into Maneater and Ravioli and hung out with them at the road into Kent while I tried to decide if the 0.8mi walk was worth it to get another ice cream. I eventually decided it wasn't worth it (plus, in the time it took me to decide 5pm had come and gone, which meant there was a good chance that things were closed) and so bade farewell to ManEater and Ravioli, who were also planning on zeroing tomorrow, and so would be behind me.
I climbed up onto another hill and followed it for a while before the trail headed almost straight down the side over a huge rocky face. The knee brace, whether through it's restriction of motion, some other alignment effect, or placebo, did seem to be helping a bit as I climbed down the steep slope, which is good because I'd really like to avoid my knees becoming as bad as they were on the long trail. The trail bottomed out at the river and followed along it for the next section, which except for the bugs, was a very pleasant walk through the heart of the deep canyon it had cut into the rocky terrain.
I reached the shelter at about 7pm and found no one using it, though almost every tent space around it was occupied. I managed to find a spot next to Molly and Laura and Sarah who were all section hikers doing portions of CT over the long weekend.
While cooking dinner I ran out of stove fuel (which I knew would happen sometime soon, since I had been using this 4oz fuel can for the past 700mi since Perisburg, VA) and so settled for a lukewarm and extra al-dente pesto pasta side.
We all watched the show the fireflies were putting on, much more numerous tonight than I had seen them before, as their flickering lights danced among the trees. Though not in any forecast I had seen, it started to rain, which sent us all scurrying back to our tents for the night. Through my tent walls I could see a light show going on in Sarah and Laura's tent, with something illuminating the tent in a rainbow of changing colors, as I drifted off to sleep among the sound of rain.","Bulls Bridge Rd
",Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter,"Jul 02, Sun",14.70
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571208,"This morning I hung out in my tent, somewhere between asleep and conscious for about 30 min listening to rain on my tent. Finally I stuck my head out... And realized it wasn't raining. It was just water falling from the trees. Aaaaand so I had no more excuse for being lazy and packed up. I didn't see anyone else stirring in camp as I left, the disco tent now still and Molly having relocated to the shelter at some point during the night (probably by being flooded out of her tent, which she hadn't brought the bathtub floor for).
I picked up where I left off last night, following the Housatonic river now covered by fog. The sun was trying to burn through and after a couple miles the trail turned away and headed uphill and so I followed. Looking down from the top of the hill, the fog had begun to lift off the river and now hung as a mini cloud in the valley. 
Not long after the trail crossed a road and I headed east, walking the 0.8mi into town. I'm still not sure what the shortest acceptable distance to hitch is, but I didn't want to waste my hitching karma on such a short trip and then not have any when I needed it, so I just walked this morning.
In West Cornwall I stopped by the outfitter's, replaced my depleted fuel can, and borrowed their wrench so that I could change out the tips of my trekking poles. After taking them off it was obvious that the one I thought had worn down was actually broken and the tip was rattling around inside instead of fastened to the end like it should've been. Either way the new tips resolved the issue and should be good to go on the rocky terrain coming up. I stopped in at the Country Store to get some breakfast and inside was delighted to overhear all the locals greeting eachother by name and inquiring about eachother's lives, a nice part about small town New England.
I took care of some stuff with my lease (for when I get back home) and then ran into Maneater, who I hadn't expected to see for a while due to their zero. She greeted me when ""what are you doing here?!"" and I replied with ""I walked! What are you doing here!?"". Turns out that they got ride with Shaggy's family to a motel 0.1mi away from this store. We hung out and chatted for a while and met Nomad, a flipflopper who had started in MA and had always flipped to head back south. According to him, in the SOBO bubble ~500 had started from Katahdin but already ~200 had dropped out due to heavy rain and terrible bugs up north. We should run into them in the next couple hundred miles, so we'll see.
I walked back to the trail and rock hopped across a brook before running into Mike ('15), one of the CT ridgerunners. He recommended the next overlook coming up while we chatted about the trail before I continued on. 
I will note how much the water had improved in CT. We're back into the hills and so most of the streams I see are crystal clear and cascading down rocky slopes, much better than the swamp water of NY/NJ. 
I came across the next overlook and found Molly there, who had leapfrogged me while I was in town. I joined her for lunch and we chatted about hiking for a bit before we both decided that we should probably get moving. She was planning on stopping at the next shelter, Pine Swamp shelter, which I didn't like the sound of (swamp = bugs) or the distance of, and so I was planning on going one more. I bade farewell and kept moving. The trail wound up and down, which I chose to interpret as it getting me back in shape for the upcoming hills and mountains of New England.
I did a bit more light rock climbing up another lemon squeezer (another huge boulder split in half and another rock face that I had to climb). After this obstacle I put my new knee brace on, which I'll begrudgingly admit helps, but is uncomfortable and bulky which is probably going to cause me to wear it less than I should. I'm still on the lookout for a replacement.
The trail descended and crossed Rt7 (again), and I decided to try to get to town for dinner at an Inn/restaurant before they closed, but no sooner had I made that decision than I ran into a Mulberry tree. Bar none, the best way to slow me down is fruit and sure enough I spent a good 15min picking and eating the berries from the branches, using my trekking pole to pull them into reach. Finally breaking myself away (ie, when all the low hanging fruit having been eaten) I continued along, walking along the Housatonic river (again). Eventually the trail emerged at a hydro electric plant, but I turned uphill and headed into town. Upon arriving I learned that the Inn is closed Mondays... sign... First the concession stand, now this... I'm beginning so see a pattern here... Mondays are not good days for town food. As a consolation prize I stopped at the package store and got a Yahoo (for now) and a Reds cider (for dinner). 
Back down to the river I walked past the hydro plant and uphill a bit to the dam which held the water for the plant at bay. Between the plant and the dam the river was only little more than a trickle over rocks which had been worn smooth from the water and now looked like a long series of water slides. Ugg, if I wasn't racing darkness to reach camp it would be great to stop and swim, but alas I was still 3mi away and there's no stealth camping allowed in CT. It was very pretty even though I didn't get to play in it.
The last couple miles of trail for the day came with my last hill for the day, and about 1000ft of climbing later I reached the turnoff for camp, only to discover that it was 0.5 off trail and far downhill. Normally I'd try to avoid doing that kind of distance and elevation off trail, but tonight I was committed. I headed down and found a German couple who already had their camp setup. Not long after I arrived SlumberTime and Wolfie, who I had passed on the uphill, pulled into camp and we had a pleasant dinner chatting. 
My tent, still wet from this morning, had mostly dried out by the time night fell and so I left the fly's open for ventilation as I drifted off.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter
",Limestone Spring Shelter,"Jul 03, Mon",21.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571209,"The owls were very talkative this morning, carrying on for about 30min at around 330am. I had breakfast with SlumberTime and Wolfie and then all 3 of us headed back up the steep trail back to the AT. The three of us hiked together for the 4mi to the road, chatting about OneGallon (a guy who I met back at the Grayson Highlands and who hikes almost all year round, wintering in an of grid cabin, and had racked up ~40,000mi of hiking so far and was aiming for 50k by the time he turned 60), my work, and various other hiking-related topics.
Just before the road we came upon a blackberry bush and spent a few minutes eating before heading down and meeting up with Jaws. The three of them were getting a ride from this road to a 4th of July party, but they apologized that they couldn't invite me as they were already 10 hikers over the capacity that the host had specified. That kinda sucked, but I understand the reasoning, and so took my leave and walked the 0.8mi into Salsbury, CT.
I got breakfast at a local cafe and then did a mini-resupply to top off my supplies to get me to Cheshire, MA. While walking through the store, thinking about my lack of plans, I figured that there had to be other hikers on trail without any plans. I'm a big fan of the saying ""The trail provides"" (meaning that you can find what you need out here one way or another if you have a good attitude and open mind), but in this case I decided that the trail wasn't providing up to my standards and that sometimes you need to make your own magic. 
I'm addition to my resupply, into the pack went a 6 pack of beer, a package of hotdogs, and a loaf of buns. Just about to walk back to the trail, I decided to stop and get an ice cream (it's the 4th after all) and emerging from the shop was hailed by a man sitting at one of the tables out front. Sir NapsAlot and I got to talking (he wants to do the AT someday) and he had just gotten done with a 4 day weekend backpacking trip in the area. His car was parked right down the street and he offered me a ride back to the trail, which I gladly accepted. See! The trail provides.
The ride was quick, but I was still glad that I didn't have to walk that 0.8mi again. Back on the trail I headed uphill (there's always an uphill after town...) and passed a number of day hikers, out enjoying this beautiful holiday. Not long after the road I passed the 1500mi marker, wooo! That's a long way, but still (thankfully) have a long way to go.
I was planning for this to be a short day (as part of my at-least-one-nero-a-week plan for staying healthy) and so my plan was to just go up to Riga shelter, at the top of this hill, which was perfect since Riga had a view (though it had unreliable water, but that could be planned for). According to AWOL there were supposed to be three water sources on the way up to the shelter. I passed one, wanting to wait to fill up so that I'd have to carry it too far, but then not long after came to a view which meant that I was past all of the streams. Well shit. If the shelter didn't have water it looks like I was hiking on. 
It didn't take too long to reach the shelter, which was 0.2mi off trail, and as I walked to the shelter I crossed the stream which was the water source for the shelter, flowing nicely. Score! The shelter was positioned so that it's occupants had a nice view of a lake and the valley below, and so I dropped pack at the picnic table out front and met Susan and Bridget, two teachers on summer vacation and doing a couple days of hiking. Sidenote: shout-out to them for finding my trail journal and signing the guest book!
Having just come up the hill they realized that they had over packed food and offered me TRAIL MAGIC in the form of a cheese stick and any of their snacks that I wanted. Had I been low on food I would've jumped at the deal, but as it were, I was overloaded myself, and so we agreed to trade a hotdog (warmed on my canister stove) for a Snickers and a salmon packet. While we were hanging out, a ridgerunner, stationed at a campsite a little ways north of here, stopped by and chatted. She refused a beer or dog, but CaptainJack accepted one of the beers, which I was happy to not have to lug  out of here.
A group of kids showed up, intending to camp for the night, and Susan and Bridget immediately began packing their bags with the intent of high tailing it out of here. They apparently had enough of kids during the school year and had no desire to camp with them, which I thought amusing. Everyone trickled out of camp and left me there and I used the time to journal for about another hour before becoming restless. It was only 3pm which meant that I could do a couple more miles, still have my short day, and camp on top of Bear Mt and hopefully see a bunch of fireworks from the surrounding towns tonight. Plan made.
I packed the remaining dogs and beer and headed out, running into Susan and Bridget talking to SirLinear, who I had run into a couple times before. I managed to offload another beer (more weight off my back!) before continuing up the mountain. Of course, as soon as I got close to the summit I ran into a no camping sign, putting a twist into my plan. I headed up anyways, enjoying the blueberries along the way and coming to the summit at the stone tower (which I'd call more of a rock pile) which was just high enough to get panoramic views of the surroundings.
Though there were a couple of obvious tent sites at the summit, I obeyed the signs and headed down the mountain, encountering a steep scramble. One occurence doesn't make a pattern, but in VT the north side of all the mountains tends to be steeper and rockier than the other side... perhaps this is the start of that. The scramble wasn't long and soon I emerged back down into the forest and camp upon the caretakers campsite. I headed up and hung out with the caretaker and Arcadia and chatted for a while, both of us trying to decide if we were going up push on and do another couple miles today. I mentioned that I still had some hotdogs and the caretaker offered that I could cook them on her propane grill, which was alot faster and easier than my stove. Arcadia and I both had two, which thankfully finished off my supply.
It felt alot later than it was at the campsite, which was tucked down in between a couple mountains, the sun already having long since set here, but Arcadia and I eventually both decided to move on. I wanted to see some fireworks tonight but didn't feel like backtracking to Bear Mt, which the caretaker was planning on doing, so I hit the trail. So much for an easy day...
The trail followed a river for a bit and then emerged from between the mountains and then started following the ridge north, paralleling the sheer hill that seperated the mountains from the valley below. I came across a river flowing towards the edge and I headed off trail to follow it and found where it began it's cascade down the rocky ridge and was treated to a view of the mountains casting their ever-elongating shadows on the land below.
Back on trail and climbing up, I followed the cliff closely for 0.6mi which allowed a continuous view to the east and the opportunity to eat as many blueberries as my stomach could fit from the plentiful bushes taking advantage of the sunny rocks to grow. The blueberries continued all the way to the peak of Race Mt, where I decided that I'd watch the sunset and any fireworks that might be visible. 
The sunset was spectacular, the receding light illuminating the spotty clouds like the slowly cooling embers of a campfire as the sun disappeared behind a mountain range to the west (possibly the catskills?). At 9pm sharp the show began, fireworks popping silently across the landscape below me. More and more locations joined in the show as the night deepened, countless silent explosions of color dotting the horizon, some so far away and so numerous as to appear to be a blinking light. I had watched fireworks from multiple towns from the top of Annapolis rocks (in MD) a couple of years ago, but never before had I realized the extent to which Americans like blowing stuff up. The show went on for some time and for most of it I didn't know which way to look... north, south, east, and west all trying to outdo the other. By the end of the show the moon had taken the sun's place, high in the sky, and was illuminating the landscape intensely enough to cause the trees to cast shadows. I used it as my light part way down the mountain, until the trees became too dense to allow it's light through.
My campsite wasn't far, only a mile or so down from the peak and it wasn't long until I had arrived and had found a (semi) flat spot for the night.
A group of kids were also staying at this site tonight and was just getting a campfire started as I was bedding down. They were having a good time... a very good time... a time so good that it was audible through my ear plugs, but I didn't feel like trying to quiet them down and so just ignored it and soon enough was fast asleep.","Limestone Spring Shelter

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571212,"I woke up to Lauraelae making a decent racket as she packed up, just as we had planned. She had overheard the caretaker mentioning that she would make pancakes when she got up, so we had conspired to ensure that she woke up at what we considered a reasonable hour. It probably wasn't necessary as her alarm went off a few minutes later, but better safe than...
The pancakes weren't anything special, but to us they were delicious, especially doused in syrup. Blue, MaryBeth, Lauraelae, and I all got packed up and hit the trail in our respective directions. It wasn't long until the sound of the highway began to mask the sounds of the forest and then the smell of cars and exhaust washed over me as I neared I-90. I crossed the overpass and not far after, at the next road crossing, ran into TRAIL MAGIC trash... there were cans and bottles around an empty cooler, a disappointing sight. I crossed the road and found TRAIL MAGIC in the form of a banana in a bag hanging from a tree. Much better.
From the road the trail headed back up into the woods and I started my only major uphill of day. About halfway up a light rain started... at first so light that it didn't even make it to the ground before being caught by the trees. Eventually however, the trees reached capacity and stated dripping on the underbrush which had me soaked in no time. I passed a couple of small ponds, normally still but now reflecting the multitude of reason drops hitting them as I walked. Only a couple ducks were visible as I passed by... I'm still hoping to see a moose one of these times. 
Continuing on, I was soon able to hear occasional cars pass on a nearby road, however it took almost half an hour to actually reach the road. At the road I walked down a short way to the home of the Cookie Lady and refilled on water and had a quick lunch since the rain had stopped. Nobody appeared to be home but I knocked anyways and was greeted by the Cookie Man who I talked with for a short while and who gave me a couple of cookies. Yum.
Their house is also a working blueberry farm but the berries weren't quite ripe yet, but they'll be spectacular when they are. Continuing on, the terrain was flat and covered in soft pine needles to cushion my steps. I crossed Bald Top Mt (I'll give you one guess as to if it was bald...Nope!) and then headed down into Dalton, MA. Walking along the street I was looking for a house with trekking poles in the front yard, who Lauraelae had tipped me usually let hikers sleep in their backyard. I came across it and found a couple of hikers hanging around, including my first SOBO! The owner of the place, Tom, came out and he was happy to let me stay, so I setup my tent. Tom had a couple of bikes for hikers to use to get around town, so I borrowed one and rode down to the community center to take advantage of their showers.
The shower was wonderful... days of sweat, mud, and dirt coming off and leaving me refreshed. I stopped at a local cafe and got a  salad and smoothie for dinner and used some of their WiFi to update my trail entertainment before heading back. When I got back Tom informed me that he had decided up cook dinner for everyone tonight and a couple minutes later we all sat down to a delicious meal of pasta, meat sauce, bread, and salad. I had second dinner and then after a couple of us walked down to the gas station and got pints of ice cream which we brought back and ate for dessert.
Tom mentioned that we should've asked about the ice cream... He would've brought us down to the food store where it's cheaper and I asked if there was a Walmart around. Next thing I know Tom had me in the car and on the way to the next town over where I was able to pick up a knee brace to replace my big, bulky, uncomfortable one.
We got back and the hikers started a game of BS with was cut short when it started to rain. Tom came out and hung 4 tarps in such a way that enclosed his front porch, turning it into a mini shelter, which 2 hikers ended up sleeping in. I retired to my tent and drifted off to sleep to the sound of the rain.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572079,"I, and I think probably everyone else in the church hall, were woken up at 5am when an early riser got up and started packing up. I had wanted to get an early start as well and so got up and moved my stuff outside while I consolidated it into my pack. 
Sidenote, one of the guys in the hall had one of the thermarest pads that I had debated switching to while I was home in MD. So glad I didn't. Those pads crinkle like no other whenever the occupant moves at all. 
I hit the trail at about 6, but didn't make it far before I headed down a road and made a quick stop at Dunkin Donuts to get 2 breakfast sandwiches. Those, along with the leftover fruit from yesterday made a great breakfast.
Back on trail, I started up the first ""real"" mountain on trail (in my opinion) since Virgina... Mt Graylock. Right at the trail head I found a cooler full of TRAIL MAGIC beer and I picked one up and packed it out to enjoy at the top of the mountain. I had about 2500ft of climbing to do, but the trail was well graded and at no point did the trail become extremely steep. As I ascended the terrain became more alpine, the deciduous trees giving way to coniferous, moss covering any ground-fall wood, and the soil becoming progressively muddier. I hadn't seen this kind of terrain since the Smokies, 1300mi ago, but it was good to be back in it.
As I usually do, I had doffed my shirt when I started climbing since there wasn't any use in getting it sweatier than it already was, but as I passed Mark Noel shelter and neared the summit I had to put it back on to retain some warmth from the cool air and chilly breeze. During the ascent the trail had become quite muddy, even though we hadn't reached Vermud yet, which I thought was false advertising since obviously Vermont is the only state that has mud on the trail.
The summit of Graylock is topped with a 93ft granite tower, crowned with a glass orb... quite a striking monument. I noticed that the lodge (located just below the summit) only served breakfast until 10, but there were some fun looking clouds blowing past the summit, and so I elected to go up and take a quick look around up top and then come back down to the lodge. The view from the top was incredible... The sun shown down from a blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds which constantly morphed into new shapes as they drifted by. Stationed in the cardinal directions were signs pointing out the sights which could be beheld from each direction, and mountains and landmarks from NY, CT, MA, VT, and NH were visible in the distance. Below I could see the lake that I had dinner next to last night in Cheshire, the hills I had traversed stretching off into the south, the sprawl of several towns in the valleys below, powerlines bee-lining into the distance, wind turbines continually waving hi to me, parts of the Catskills, Stratton and Glastonberry Mountains (which I'd climb in the next couple days), and the endless woods of the Northeast. I took in the view for a few minutes and snapped a few pictures before deciding that it wasn't going anywhere and that I could safely go and have second breakfast.
I got an omelette at the restaurant inside the lodge and ate with Immrum and chatted about the upcoming section of trail. Heading back out I ran into Lost chatting with Socks and then headed back up to the top. I was hoping to go into the tower to get an even better view of the surroundings, unobstructed by trees, however it was closed for repairs until July 2017... Wait a second... That's now. I didn't think arguing that point was going to get me into the tower, so, oh well.
I sat for a few minutes and took in the warm sun and enjoying once again, for the first time in a long time, being eye-to-eye with the clouds. Eventually though, it was time to get moving, so I saddled up and continued hiking. It took a few minutes to find a blaze amongst the labrynth of paths which criss-crossed the summit, but after that I headed down to the thunderbolt trail which the AT followed. This was the first, but certainly not the last time that the AT would take us along a ski trail.
I crossed a couple ups and downs and the top of William Mt (which didn't really seem like a summit...) before deciding to take my lunch in a quiet, shady spot. I enjoyed the beer I had picked up earlier and then got moving again and of course, not 10min later, came to a magnificent northward view that would've been a great lunch spot. From this vantage the town of North Adams (which we'd cross through) as well as an unbroken line of mountains and forest stretched northwards... The Green Mountains. I chatted with a few local day hikers before moving on and heading down the steep and muddy descent. This downhill in places rivaled the steepest trail I'd seen on trail and eventually broke into switchbacks, but not until most of the descent had been completed.
Emerging into town I found Socks again and we both decided that with only 7mi left to the shelter for the night we had time for a cold drink. We walked down a couple blocks to stop-n-shop and I picked up some drinks, fruit, and a new knee brace (I hate one of the ones I have... It's too restrictive to motion and is uncomfortable to wear for long periods). The store was right next to Papa John's, which offers 50% off everything for hikers, but unfortunately I wasn't nearly hungry enough to tackle a pizza. 
Back on the trail I headed up into the mountains, retracing my steps from last fall which had brought me down this mountain after 17 days on the Long Trail. It's interesting to look back on being so excited to be done and to get back to modern comforts after having had just a taste of the hiker lifestyle on the LT. So far I've been on the AT for ~6x as long at this point and am fully immersed.
I headed up a rather steep hill and then got waylayed by a GIANT blueberry patch on a sunny rock outcrop. Several other hikers came and went as I picked and ate for about 45min, not having come even close to exhausting the supply. Finally I pulled myself away, not wanting to get to camp too late, and continued on. 
It wasn't too long after that that I completed my 10th state, Massachusetts, and entered Vermont, the 11th! Good to be back!
The last couple miles to camp were uneventful, but it was interesting to see how different the landscape looked with all it's leaves still hanging. Last time I had been through here had been early morning with the sun casting it's rays through the sparse red and yellow leaves, coloring the entire forest. Now, dense green foliage surrounded the trail in the height of it's summer growth. 
I got to Seth Warner shelter, our camp for our last night on the LT last October. Just like last time though someone already had the fire going for us, this time Sherpa and SchholBus. Their trail cat, PackCat (guess where he gets to ride...) was napping in preparation for his nightly work as I setup my tent (and realized that I had forgotten to dry it out after Dalton, whoops).
We all had dinner and chatted throughout the evening as the sun set the sky aflame behind us. While I was hanging my bear line I managed to severely stub my big toe, hard enough to draw blood around the periphery of the nail and making it painful to walk around. So that was dumb...I probably really should have closed toed camp shoes. Hopefully I get to keep the toenail...
Tomorrow Socks, Lost, and I are heading to Glastonberry fire tower with the intention of camping there to get sunset, sunrise, and maybe some stars, so that should be fun. That's 21mi from here, but combined with going into Bennington to get my package and resupply, it should be a busy day.","Cheshire, MA
",Seth Warner Shelter,"Jul 09, Sun",21.10
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572080,"I awoke to the sounds of Sock's laughter eminating from the shelter and echoing across the campsites at 530 which finally motivated me to get up. I packed up my stuff and my tent and then relocated to the shelter to make breakfast and socialize.
At 6am Socks proclaimed that he was late and finished packing up and headed out, with Lost not far behind. I took another couple minutes to use the privy and finish packing before following them. I caught up to them after the first mountain, first hearing distant voices and bits of conversation before finally closing to where I could join in. We chatted throughout the morning about various topics, fire fighting, forestry, and other trails... things that Socks had done and was knowledgeable about, since he's the main talker. He seems to be an interesting person, having done all these adventurous things.
We passed a pond created by a beaver dam, the beaver swimming around in his personal swimming pool right up until Socks got his phone up and running to take a picture at which point he dived under. A little while later we came to another gorgeous pond which the trail skirted on a series of boardwalks which seemed to actually be located below water line, the water held back only by the engineering ingenuity of the industrious beavers.
Lost was mudblazing for us, showing Socks and I every path which would lead to wet shoes before finally just giving up and walking straight through the pervasive mud. Socks and I continued our dance behind her throughout the morning, doing our best to avoid the worst of it. This section, the only section of the LT I have not hiked seems to be the muddiest of all, though it's hard to tell if that's because of the trail or the different season.
To explain, I hiked the Long Trail (LT) last fall, but about 2 days before HeavyD, BA, Faceplant, and I had reached this point my finger began to swell. And turn colors. Colors that a finger should not be. Like green and black. By the time we got here my finger was double it's normal size, painful to the touch, and colorful, and I decided that I needed to be looked at faster than I could finish the trail, and so I got off trail at Rt9 and went down to Bennington to the urgent care. By the time my finger had been drained, antibiotics prescribed, and my medical supplies picked up it was too late in the day to get back to the trail and hike this section, and so I yellow blazed to the road crossing just before Seth Warner shelter to catch up to the rest of the group, leaving this 9mi undone. Well, now I was back and finishing the LT to become an official End-to-Ender.
We took a rest at Cogdon shelter and Socks  shared some of the 2lbs of twizzlers he was carrying, which he had picked up 2/$3 at the store yesterday. I didn't stay long, striking out solo go try to get to town and back at a reasonable hour. Socks, Lost, and I had all discussed sleeping up at the fire tower on Glastonbury Mt tonight, so I'd meet them there later today. I skirted through a ton of mud on my way up to Porqupine Ridge and enjoyed a nice view of Bennington and it's large stone obelisk. Along the way I was startled by a grouse erupting from the underbrush and taking to the sky, which had yet to happen to me on the AT but had been all too familiar on the LT. Guess it's a VT thing...
After a steep downhill I reached the road and set about finding a ride. After about 20min I manged to get one, from a woman coming back from a cigarette buying trip to NH (which has no sales tax). While waiting I did have one false alarm after someone pulled into the parking lot that I had stationed myself ahead... he was only coming to hike for the day, and asked me if this was the Allegheny Trail. I informed him that this was in fact the Appalachian Trail, and he thanked me and offered me a ride if I was still there when he returned, which I was glad I wasn't.
I headed to the post office, picked up my package containing my next months supply of contacts, a new dry bag for my food (13L isn't cutting it anymore,  especially on the first day out of town and definitely wouldn't work for the 100mi wilderness, so I got my 20L), a refresher on earplugs, and a cable to replace my headphones which had been on the fritz recently (due to internal damage to the wire from minimum bending radius violations from inside my hipbelt). After that I picked up another day of food (to get me to Manchester, VT), and some gause for my toe. Every time I'm in Bennington I end up buying medical supplies to take care of my digits, this seems to be an unlucky city for me...
After that I headed to the Two Brews cafe, where I got lunch and hung out for a while to charge my phone. I picked up some new headphones and a four pack of 16oz hard ciders for tonight at the fire tower before heading back to the cafe to repack.
Back in the cafe a mother and daughter had taken over my table so I joined them and got to talking and they were super into my hike and gave me TRAIL MAGIC of $20. While I had never directly received money as trail magic before, I didn't see a way to politely refuse their offer, and it would pay for half a week of food, or my lodging through VT, etc, so I thanked them before heading out.
Back on Rt9, I hadn't even reached the edge of town before I got a ride. The guy driving explained that he had someone do something nice for him this morning and was just passing it on. As we drove the 5mi back to the trail he revealed that he was interested in doing the trail someday and we chatted about my experience thus far. Before leaving I promised to pass on the good deed, which I think the cider I'm packing for Socks and Lost will count for.
I powered up the steep hill from the road, remembering my frantic pace down this the last time I had convered this ground, which had been in the rain. Last fall I had left the others at the last shelter and gone ahead to hitch into town with my finger painfully throbbing, preventing me from fully utilizing my trekking poles, and my knees aching. My experience this time was wholely different and much more enjoyable... though my knees are sore, they're holding up better than last time and my toe does hurt, especially when I stub it while hiking (which I've never noticed before, but it turns out I do regularly), but all and all I'm a stronger hiker (and perhaps person) now. Or I've invested more in this hike than the LT and am stubborn... Take your pick.
The hill leveled out and turned into a gradual uphill, my favorite terrain. Despite the roots and rocks I crushed it, catching up to AlreadyStinky and LuckyPenny at a stream..I chatted with them for a bit, since I had seen them a couple times in the past couple days, before continuing on.
I summited a wooded mountain, headed down for a bit, and then climbed up Glastenbury Mt. Being the end of the day, the hill seemed to go on forever and I didn't have much hindsight to navigate by since last time it was raining and foggy and I was distracted by my finger. I finally reached the stream right before the shelter and found Lost cleaning the mud off her feet. I filled up on water and Socks, Lost, and I headed up to the summit since the shelter was full of LT hikers. We joked amongst ourselves that us trail-hardened AT hikers would push on to the tower and leave the shelter for the LT hikers, but in truth we had been planning this anyways. 
We got to the top and found that the tower had no windows, which wouldn't be very pleasant since rain was expected. We tried to rig Sock's tarp to cover the western windows (where the wind and rain would likely come from), but we couldn't get it secured well and finally retired to the ground to setup our tent/hammock, settling on walking up the tower to watch sunset and sunrise.
Socks doesn't carry a personal shelter, he always sleeps in the trail shelters, so Lost agreed to let him bunkbed with her hammock, sleeping right under get to use her tarp for rain protection. As we setup we got swarmed with bugs so we quickly retreated back up the tower for dinner.
I had the cider and it turned out that Lost had whiskey, which we shared after dinner. If you had told me that I'd be half drunk in a Firetower on top of mountain with this kind of great people this time last year I would've called bullshit, but here I sat. I don't think any of us have laughed that hard in a long time as we did enjoying our time up there tonight.
Finally, we took a couple moments to enjoy the scenery, the mountains various shades of blue fading into the distance in every direction. Between their peaks, a scattering of ponds gleamed in the evening light and the forest stretched on forever in each direction. We had no sunset tonight as the sun ducked behind the clouds to the west and disappeared, but that was alright. Looking north, once again the horizon was full with mountains that we'd have to climb, a welcome sight after having been in the lowlands for so long through the Mid-Atlantic.
We headed to bed not long after, at around 8pm. I cleaned and bandaged my toe again... It's one thing to lose a nail, it'd be another to get it infected. We've got a couple days of rain ahead, which won't help the mud situation, but I'd rather have rain here than in the Whites, so hopefully we'll build up some good sun karma with this. Apparently there's a BBQ going on tomorrow, put on by Sunny, that we may or may not have a ride to, so we'll see tomorrow. If not we'll hike up to Stratton Pond shelter. I think I might try hike with these guys for a while, it's a good time.","Seth Warner Shelter
",Glastonbury Firetower,"Jul 10, Mon",21.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572081,"I had gone to sleep with my rain fly partially open (for ventilation) and had to close it during the night when some light rain started. I woke up this morning to the gentle patter of tiny drops on my tent as the trees offloaded their stored rain.
Lost had gotten a text from Sunny overnight and we had to get ourselves to a forest service road 11mi down trail by 1pm for extraction and transport to the party. 11mi would only take us about 4hr to hike, so it being 5am, we all rolled over and slept in a bit more.
We hit the trail at around 8am, Lost once again breaking trail for us through the muddy trail and wet underbrush. We chatted throughout the morning about various topics: kayaking, cycling, hiking, and the terrain wasn't particularly tough this morning (though not ""all downhill"" as we had been lead to believe). We took a quick break at  Story Spring shelter and were happy to get a couple minutes of sunshine poking through the cloud cover.
We reached the road at 1240 and hung out, waiting for our ride. Lost says she can smell us (and herself) so we must be getting pretty stinky. We also joked about how we could smell day hikers by their soap. 
A couple minutes after 1pm a car pulled up and out popped Sunny who immediately opened the trunk and offered us a beer or soda. We piled our packs in the back and hopped in (get it... hopped in? :P ) and soon we were flying over the dirt roads, twisting their way out of the mountains. 
It took about 45min to get to Manchester, only 20mi up the trail from where we had gotten off, and driving through town Sunny spotted a hiker walking and pulled over. His name was JustTim, an LT SOBO, and he commented how people don't usually pull over for him without him having a thumb up, and he was floored when Sunny offered him a ride and/or a soda/beer. Sunny explained that we were all hikers as well. JustTim passed on the offer, since he was getting lunch in town, and we headed up to Sunny's house.
Sunny's place (or rather, his parent's place) had 3 stories and he led us around to the front where a line of backpacks sat along the entire front porch. Hiker party! We stepped inside and were greeted by a bunch of cheerful, clean hikers and the three of us made a bee line for the shower so that we could feel a little more presentable while hanging out. We also threw our laundry in and so I put on my rain jacket so that I could wash my camp shirt... rain jacket laundry being a not uncommon sight among hikers.
Upstairs we were presented with a ton of fruit, veges, beer, and snacks and hung out until the 7 pizzas Sunny's parents had ordered arrived. We managed to restrain ourselves while a couple pictures were snapped and then we dug in, the 10 hikers devouring all but a few slices of the pizza. We hung out on the porch, enjoying the warm sun and view of the mountains towering above the valley spread out below.
Sunny was nice enough to drive us down to the Price Chopper down in town so that we could resupply. When we got back and started consolidating our food into our packs I realized that I had almost filled my recently acquired 20L dry bag. Just goes to show, if there's space it will be filled. I'm addition to my resupply I also decided to pack out the last 3 slices of pizza for dinner... probably unnecessary but it would be better than anything I had packed and would save me from having to cook.
At last the party was winding down and everyone was trying to get back to the trail or down into town to find a place to stay. Lost decided that she was going to zero tomorrow, so she managed to find a resident who will take in hikers and so headed off with them for the night. Socks and I, not feeling like we needed to and not wanting to zero here, got a ride back to the trail with Sunny. 
The ride back to the trail was wonderful, once again flying over the roads which wound through the mountains of Vermont. I sat with my window open, enjoying the feel of the wind in my face and taking in the sights. As we returned to the dirt roads on the final leg of our journey back up into the mountains the smell changed noticeably, the earthy scents of the forest clearly discernible as the temperature also cooled in the presence of the moist forest. To our right, the river tumbled downhill over the rocks next to the road, exposing massive boulders and having washed huge trees downstream along its course. We passed several secluded ponds, surrounded by dense fields of evergreen trees, some only visible for a second through a gap in the trees as we sped past. I'm trying here, but really, words fail to describe the beauty of Vermont. 
All too soon the ride was over and we were back where we had left off that day, a trail crossing of a small dirt road in the middle of the forest. As Sunny pulled away my ears seemed to ring for a while while they reacclimated to the silence of the forest compared to the roar of the car and the wind. We had 1.6mi to go until we hit the next road crossing, just beyond which I knew that there was some camping (from my last time through this way) even though AWOL didn't note any. The miles didn't take long, though the trail was exceptionally muddy, especially compared to our clean clothes. 
We found some TRAIL MAGIC... a bag of carrots... at the trailhead, but didn't partake in this unique gift because we had no way to use a carrot at the moment and were still pretty stuffed with pizza. At camp we found 2 LT NOBOs with their hammocks already setup and found a spot for ourselves right across the trail and next to a river where I erected my tent and Socks layed out his tarp and setup his sleeping bag. Our timing today had been just about perfect because we finished setting up in the fading light directly following the sunset and so we joined the LT'ers for a campfire. We had the fire going in no time thanks to some birch bark (its nice to be back in the part of the country where nature gives you the perfect fire-starter) and sat around chatting for a little while. I broke out the ciders that I had packed out, sharing one with Socks, and enjoyed my pizza dinner as we chatted. 
Eventually though, a little before 10pm, waaayyyy past hiker midnight, both Socks and I were having trouble staying awake and decided to hit the hay (or pine needles in this case). We hung our bear bag with some trouble, struggling to hoist the heavy food and overcome the friction of the rough pine bark before finally getting it up there.","Glastonbury Firetower

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572082,"Socks and I both woke up around 5am and through silent agreement rolled back over for another 45min of sleep. He was packed up quicker than I (since he didn't have a tent and had cowboy camped) and hit the trail a couple minutes before me.
I followed a couple minutes after, passing the LTer's, still fast asleep in their hammocks. The climb up the mountain was pleasant, the trail was well graded and not overly rocky as I ascended into a cloud. The sun started to peak through, sun beams piercing the fog and canopy.
At almost 4000ft tall, Stratton Mt is the highest point on the AT in Vermont (but not the highest mountain in VT, Mt Mansfield, which is on the LT north of where the AT splits off) and usually offers spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and ponds. Today however, I was treated to yet another panoramic view of a cloud from the top of the fire tower on the summit. Socks decided to head down but I lingered a few minutes at the summit, hoping the caretakers would come out of their cabin and chat (and maybe even offer an apple, as they had last fall when we chatted), but no such luck. Eventually I got up and shouldered my pack, breaking the pristine silence at the top of the mountain. and kept moving, heading down the mountain. Of course, as I descended the fog broke and soon enough a clear blue sky was visible above me, but I wasn't about to turn around and re-climb the mountain for the view. 
The trail down the mountain was as pleasant as the trail up had been, not too rocky nor steep, which made Stratton a very enjoyable mountain to traverse. Down at the bottom I came to Stratton pond and took in the undisturbed wilderness which bordered the pond, the smooth water marred only by the ripples of a gentle breeze, and the gray clouds boiling in the sky high above the pond. I stopped and took a break at the pond and chatted with a couple LT NOBOs and a couple of section SOBOs, taking in the scenery and allowing Socks a bit more of a lead on me. 
The next couple miles weren't particularly challenging, and I cruised over the relatively flat terrain, dancing around the mud puddles... I mean trail. I came up with a new candle scent as I hiked... muddy evergreen, which combines the sweet smell of the evergreen trees with the deep earthy tones of well trampled mud. I met up with Socks just before Prospect rock, where I decided to take lunch, overlooking Manchester Center where we had just spent the previous afternoon. The view we such that I could see individual cars driving along main street, just as we had to get to the Price Chopper we resupplied at yesterday. Socks continued ahead soon after and I chatted with a couple of NOBO LT sectioners who were just finishing up their trip at Manchester before I followed.
I stopped at Spruce Peak, an overlook that I had skipped last year on the LT because of fading daylight, but was disappointed to find it tree'd in such that all I could see was a dense wall of conifers. Back on the trail I passed a guy covered from head to toe... headnet, long sleeves, gloves, pants such that no bug stood a change at getting to his skin. We exchanged short greetings as we passed, and I found the juxtaposition amusing, with my lack of shirt and shorts. HYOH!
I crossed the busy road, VT-11, and passed a water jug with a note on it (that I didn't bother reading), planning to fill up at the shelter so as to save myself from carrying water father than I had to. The initial ascent of Bromley Mt was tame, gentle sloping and switchbacking up the mountain and crossing numerous mountain streams (and their associated mud). I came across Socks at Bromley Shelter and found out that he had left me that jug of water and note from some trail magic he had gotten... whoops! I filled up my water from the spring at the shelter while Socks admired its design and construction, with its 4 bunks and ladder in between, benches bordering the covered porch and picnic table, and pegs spaced all around for hanging packs. Everything a thru hiker needs!
The last mile up to the summit was steep, and the 3L of water I had taken on weighed on my back, making me glad I hadn't filled up at the bottom, trail magic or no. Eventually the trail dumped out onto a ski trail, which we followed up to the summit amidst a field of wildflowers and views of the surrounding mountains behind us. For a green circle ski trail, it was still pretty steep to walk up, but it passed quickly and we found ourselves at the summit and home for the night. At the summit of Bromley Mt the ski area maintained a warming hut for skiiers in the winter, but left it open for hikers to use during the summer and Socks and I joined LT NOBOs Bill and Julie in the hut. 
Though the bugs were out in force, we all enjoyed our dinner out on the chairlift which gave us a commanding view of the surrounding landscape... Stratton Mt (where we had been this morning) and its ski area clearly visible in the distance as well as Mt Snowe and a number of other un-named (at least to me) mountains. I found some wild strawberries a little down the hill and collected and ate those for a while, a great dessert! Part of the reason that we had chosen to stay here (apart from the view) was the fact that it was supposed to rain pretty hard tonight and a little before sunset the clouds started to roll in, so dense that at times the chairlift wasn't even visible from the hut. During breaks in the clouds we could still see over to Stratton, which had been once again wreathed in a halo of clouds which were streaming off the mountain in the wind, colored orange and pink by the fading sunlight.","Kelley Stand Rd

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572083,"Laying in my sleeping bag on top of the bench that I was using as a bed inside the warming hut, I awoke to the sound of a downpour hitting the roof of the hut. I was very glad we had decided to sleep here last night. We all got up pretty early but dallied in our morning routines, trying to delay our starts in the hopes that the rain would stop. I looked at the log book, which was from 2014, a very old log compared to most that you find on the AT.
Glancing through the pages I was surprised to find that my friends from middle school, RebelBear and Woodstock, were here last night?! I knew that they were on the trail, but had no idea where they were since they started in Boiling Springs, PA this year. I had been keeping an eye on the logs, but up until now hadn't seen any sign of them. Cool! Maybe I'll catch them today. 
Socks and I decided to wait out the rain since we weren't planning on doing very many miles today, and so hung out in the hut until about 7am when the rain had mostly stopped. Although the radar showed another band of rain coming our way, we didn't feel like waiting around for another couple hours when getting wet was an inevitability anyways, and so we headed out. 
We crossed the peak of the mountain, passed a huge concrete piling that used to counterweight the old chairlift, and then headed down into the woods on the north side of the mountain. Within seconds we were entirely soaked, the front of my clothes as wet as if I had just gone for a swim, from all the water that had accumulated on the leaves. We descended Bromley and the trail was generally pretty easy except for the humongous pits of mud which we seemed to run into every couple of feet. Last fall when I had hiked the LT I remember thinking that the mud was pretty bad and that I could understand why people called it Vermud... little did I know what real mud looked like, the stuff we now danced around and over, using rocks, roots, and logs like lilly pads to jump over the obstacles. 
Despite my best efforts, my shoes were wet immediately, both from the plants depositing their water onto my legs and from a few unfortunate steps onto a stable looking rock, or a not-as-slippery-looking-as-it-actually-was root. We went down, up, across (where we passed Bill and Julie, who had left earlier than us this morning), and down and arrived at Peru shelter, where we took a bit of a break. Though it was only 10am, I had my lunch since we were about halfway done with our miles for the day and there was no point in waiting until noon, after we were almost done for the day, to re-energize my body with food. Socks and I refilled on water, chatted with Bill and Julie for a few minutes after they arrived, and then headed out. 
We passed a lake and crossed several outflowing streams with boardwalks across them. Made of smooth wood, these boardwalks are just about the slipperiest surface that we've walked on, and so I pioneered a technique of taking a couple of windup steps and then surfing the rest of the plank, figuring a controlled slide was safer (and more fun, and cooler looking) than an uncontrolled slide. Back into the woods Socks and I separated a bit as our different paces allowed me to pull ahead until we reached the rock scramble which took us up over the top of Baker peak. While doing this scramble on the wet rocks (which were thankfully rough and uneven enough that we still had traction) we passed a group of young kids, apparently at an outdoors summer camp, and had convince their counselors that they didn't need to let us pass the kids in this precarious position, no matter what camp policy was. 
Past them we cruised the distance to Lost Pond shelter, which I had previously hiked in pre-dawn light last year having hit Baker peak at just about sunrise last time. We again took another small break here and headed down to the shelter and ran into 3 SOBOs who were getting a very late start today, hoping to wait out the rain. From my experience this morning I knew their goal to be hopeless, but in talking to them I got the impression that their hike had been pretty wet so far and so could understand their desire to stay dry. They headed out and a few minutes later we followed them, passing a tent and a hammock of two SOBOs who apparently had an even stronger desire to stay dry than the previous three. 
Socks and I followed Long Branch River for a while, and mused about how on a nicer day we would definitely be dropping our packs and hanging out here for a while and playing in the river. Today however, we'd pass, as the cool temperatures and moisture forced us to either keep moving or don some additional layers.
Crossing a road we hit a patch of beautiful trail... flat, with no rocks, and no elevation change for about a mile, which we enjoyed. After that however, the trail began following a river and quickly became rocky, wet, and muddy, the trail even merging with the swollen river at some points. We finally emerged at the pond and found the shelter, relieved to find the caretaker absent (we had heard rumors that they took days off during the week, and sometimes when raining) which meant that we wouldn't have to pay the $5 that the Green Mountain Club charged for this shelter. Socks was a little riled up about having to pay for the shelter, since he thought (and I don't disagree) that it sets a dangerous precedent for trail clubs to be able to charge hikers for the use of their shelters, which is very against the spirit of the AT), so I was happy that we got to avoid the problem/engagement altogether.
The shelter itself was great, 4 bunks which could each fit 2 hikers (3 if it was raining), a ladder, pegs for hanging packs, mice hangs for hanging food, benches around the periphery, a covered porch and a picnic table... this place had it all. Pretty soon after arriving I had to don my long johns, which I was very glad I has gotten mailed back to me in Bennington, and put on my puffy for the first time in a couple weeks. We had arrived at the shelter at about 230pm, and so now had the whole afternoon ahead of us to hang out, chill, and try not to eat all of our food out of boredom. This shelter had no cell signal and so without the distractions of the outside world I took a nap or two, journaled a bit, and relaxed. Bill and Julie arrived a couple hours after we did, making very good time considering the conditions, terrain, and the fact that they had less than 100miles under their belt so far. 
We headed to bed early due to the cold, quieting down before 7pm. A little bit after that LuckyPenny and AlreadyStinky showed up and claimed a bunk before making their dinner and heading to bed.","Bromley Warming Hut

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575195,"We got moving early this morning, before most of camp was awake, including Rebel Bear and Woodstock. Though we had technically entered the Whites yesterday (actually... I think we've been in White Mountain National Forest since just after Vermont, but whatever), today would be our first taste of the mountains. We headed up and out of camp, Lost leaving a couple minutes ahead of me while I finished packing, distance that I'd close as soon as the hill started. Just up the trail from camp I got waylay-ed by some raspberry bushes on the side of a short roadwalk and ate as many as I could find for a while. 
The bushes picked as bare as I could manage without wading into the thorny middle, I continued on, though had trouble finding the trail. I headed a bit farther up the road and then turned into a small parking lot at a trail head, but for the life of me I couldn't find a blaze. I ended up headed back down the road, back to the raspberry bushes, where I found a blaze painted onto the road directing hikers into the woods. I look up at the blaze just up the road, which I had followed, confused, before realizing that that wasn't in fact a blaze. I think it was just intended as a road reflector. But it was the right size and shape, and it was visible from the trail. Of course, had I been on the trail and not across the street picking raspberries I would've hit this first blaze before getting to the reflector blaze, but anyways.
Back on track the trail headed through some fields filled with tall grass and then into the woods and started climbing. I passed a junction for another trail which the sign indicated led to the summit of Moosilauke, but in double the distance. Guess which way the AT went? The steeper one. So up I went. I caught up to Lost shortly after and hiked with her as we pulled ourselves up the mountain. We put on my Disney playlist and tried to have a sing-along, to distract from the hill we were climbing, but with the climb won as it had taken all of our breath and we didn't have enough left to make sound that actually resembled singing. So it turned into kinda a talk-along. 
We climbed slowly but could see our progress by glimpsing back behind us through the trees as we first surpassed the surrounding mountains and then the lower peaks of Moosilauke. Eventually the trail met up with the carriage road, a wonderfully flat piece of trail which connected the two summits of the mountain (and presumably connected to somewhere carriage accessible down the mountain, but who knows). This was probably the best trail we had hiked in 500miles... wide, flat, slightly muddy but not deep enough that you actually had to worry about it, and with fantastic views out to our right side through the short trees struggling to survive up here. From our position we could see our goal up ahead, the summit of the mountain, and the trail that we'd take up there winding through the pockets of brush and trees which existed in sheltered hollows of the summit terrain. 
The trail up here was marked with carins, some taller than Lost, since the trees could not bear any blazes. The summit of the mountain was marked simply with a sign proclaiming the elevation, stuck into a crack in the rocks, and all around the landscape laid out before us. Wispy white clouds flowed through the steep-sided valleys which separated the titanic hunks of rock which jutted into the sky and on which we now stood. The sun shown and even on this calm morning the wind blew enough that we took cover behind one of the small rock snowball-forts that had been erected by hikers over the years in the same position as we. We enjoyed a snack and Lost joked that she couldn't show the summit picture to her friends at home because they, being from Colorado, would make fun of her and dispute calling a 4000ft peak a mountain at all. 
There were a couple of other hikers up on the summit on this beautiful morning, but thankfully not too many and everyone took in the scenery peacefully. We eventually got moving, having only a couple hours to get down the other side of this mountain before my friend was to pick us up. It was a little sad to dive back into the tree-line and loose the fantastic views of the Whites to our east and the flat terrain (at least compared to the Whites) to our West, but we kept moving downhill and started passing a ton of people heading up. It was obvious that it was a weekend from the sheer quantity of hikers this morning, and I was very glad we had summitted as early as we had and avoided the crowds which would be forming at the top. We passed a couple people and in a brief exchange they lamented how there was no warm up period for this hike... they left the parking lot and immediately started going straight up, which we found funny. 
Soon, the trail turned steep and we started descending in earnest, having to pick our steps carefully and use the surrounding trees for support. The trail followed a stream down which turned into waterfalls every so often but the water flowing off the mountain left the rocks the trail traversed wet and fairly slick. The trail maintainers had mounted wooden steps to some of the steeper faces by driving giant bolts into the rock, but using the slim steps with no handholds the descent still felt precarious despite their best efforts. 
On the way down I met a family on a day hike, sitting and enjoying a waterfall. I got to talking with them, while I waited for Lost, and they were super curious about the details of thru hiking... how did I get food, how did I not have to work, where my trail name came from, etc and I was happy to answer as the father tried to egg his son into saying he wanted to thru hike. They were fun to talk to and ended up pulling a beer out of the lunch they had packed and gave it to me, which I very much appreciated and Lost looked a little jealous of as she passed by. It pays to be friendly! And hike fast and take breaks...
The family continued up the mountain and I down it, but I instantly realized that I couldn't descend and hold a beer at the same time, not while walking down the widely spaced and somewhat slick wooden blocks that were serving as steps. I took a few more minutes to enjoy the falls, finished half the beer, dumped the rest into an empty water bottle, and continued down to catch up with Lost. She gladly accepted the rest of the beer, having not wanted to jump into the conversation with the family to try to get her own beer, though we both agreed that drinking beer from a water bottle was not the ideal way to consume it.
The descent ended up taking a couple hours, longer than I was hoping, but it all worked out because my friend ended up running into traffic and being late. Lost and I got to the road about 30min before she was expect to arrive and so walked down the road a quarter of a mile to a scenic overlook/pond where we laid our stuff out on a picnic table to dry. We both waded into the pond and washed off a bit, hoping to knock down some of the hiker stank before my friend arrived. The sun felt great as we dried off and we were intentionally oblivious to the looks from the day visitors were around for this, though a couple of them were familiar with thru hiking and joked about it with us as we waited. 
My friend said that she drove a Subaru, which turned out to not be a very helpful description as almost every other car that pulled into the lot ended up being a Subaru, but it was easy enough to pick her out when she arrived. We drove back to Southern NH with her, stopping at a grocery store to resupply and get ingredients for dinner. Once home, showers we had and she offered spare clothes to wear while we did laundry. Lost and I tried to help cook, but she had it covered, and whipped up some pasta and homemade, family recipe pasta sauce","Jeffers Brook Shelter

",Carter Notch Hut,"Jul 29, Sat",16.70
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574044,"As usual, all the thru hikers were up bright and early to get all of our gear packed up before any of the guests came back to the common area. I hopped back in the kitchen and began helping with breakfast preparations and taking care of some late night dishes from when we ate last night. This morning was pancakes, bacon, and oatmeal for breakfast, which kept the croo and I busy as we (but mostly they) prepared the food and I took care of all the dishes coming back from the tables.
At this point, since this replacement croo was short staffed (as they always seem to be), I had done all the dishes from a full day of hut life... a dinner and a breakfast essentially by myself as the other three croo members tried to keep on top of the meal itself. I think they should hire me...
After the meal had finished and we had had our fill (the remaining thru hikers polished off everything except for the oatmeal... which for me at least, is a last thing I'll voluntarily eat) everyone started heading their seperate ways. I took my time packing up, not in a huge hurry to get moving, and said goodbye to the croo. I got hugs from each one of them and a couple pieces of leftover cake to pack out, as a thank you for helping out so extensively. Honestly though, this was the best croo I've worked with... I always have a lot more fun when I actually earn my keep and especially when I can earn my way onto the croo by helping out.
Finally, I could delay no longer, and I hit the trail, immediately heading up a cliff towards Carter Dome. Though not quite as steep or long as the ascent up wildcat, it was close, but the beautiful day and the cool air being held in the shade of the ever-shorter trees made the hike pretty enjoyable for how much effort it required. I passed a couple people from the hut, a couple that I talked to about my thru hiker presentation last night before moving on, and eventually reached the top and was treated to views of my hike for the day, the summits of the Carter's and Moriah visible before me.
I didn't linger too long and headed down to High Mt, which although lower than Carter dome, offered panoramic 360deg views from its rocky summit. I enjoyed a piece of cake as a snack as I took in the sights, the Presidentials behind me, Maine just off to the East, Gorham visible down in the valley just a little ways north, and mountains stretching off in every direction as far as the eye could see. A couple of locals were up there having a snack and talked about their hikes on many of the surrounding peaks as we hung out.
Though beautiful, the wind on the exposed summit soon had me pretty chilly and I had to move on, heading down a couple steep scrambles. The trail crested a number of smaller peaks... definitely not mountains, but just ripples in the rock, but each poked back above tree line and offered another glimpse of the surrounding mountains from a slightly different vantage point and kept the hike interesting. 
Throughout the day I bounced up and down along the peaks, racking up quite a bit of elevation, or so my legs informed me. Finally I reach Mt Moriah and headed down my last hill of the day. A couple of SOBOs had said the downhill to town was all very easy terrain, but that definitely wasn't the case. A bunch of steep scrambles, steep trail, rock hopping, root hopping later, I finally got down to the Rattle River shelter, after which I was able to cruise the last 2mi to town. 
I finally got down to the traihead, tired from today's hike, and thankfully managed to hitch a ride into town with a guy coming back from buying a motorcycle fender for his bike. I don't know anything about motorcycles, but that was ok, he could hold the conversation with minimal prompting from me.  He dropped me off downtown and I thanked him before he continued to make his was back home in VT, and I walked the last little bit to The Barn and checked in. 
It turns out the Lost has decided not to hike today, electing to take a zero to give her cold another day to blow over, and so was happily sitting in bed when I pulled in. I flopped down on a bed, claiming it by exploding my pack onto it, and grabbed a shower, the first real shower in almost a week (though I had had a waterfall shower more recent than that). 
Clean and as presentable as I get, Lost and I headed down to the Saalt Pub, which had been recommended to me by a day hiker, and had a burger and beer. Afterwards I hit the gas station to pick up a pint of ice cream and we headed back to the hostel to watch Game of Thrones, although we ended up conking out before it came on.
I'm not sure what Lost's plan is for tomorrow... I need to hit Walmart (Last one on the trail!) to pick up a few things... hopefully a new shirt (this one that I've had since Perisburg, VA is getting a little beat up), a new knee brace (today the spring exploded out the side of one of mine), and some food items. I wouldn't mind a zero to recover from the Whites, but also wouldn't mind hiking out in the afternoon and doing at least a couple miles. We'll see what happens!","Carter Notch Hut
","Gorham, NH","Jul 30, Sun",15.20
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574045,"Last night I didnt sleep very well, I woke up a couple times during the night to the roar of a truck going by on the street just in front of the barn, and a couple times because I couldn't breathe very well... my nose had become stuffed over the course of the night and was dripping down my throat which would surely give me a sore throat by the morning. Alas, I was right, and by the time I got up at 630 I had a very uncomfortable throat and was still stuffed up, so I headed down to the gas station just down the street to try to get some medicine, but their sad selection didn't have anything useful and so I returned empty handed.
I roused Lost and she decided that she was going to hike onwards from Rt2 with me today and wanted to leave late in the day and only do a few miles, a plan which worked well for me since I needed to do laundry and visit walmart to resupply. My plan was breakfast and then walmart and so she elected to come along for the first part of the plan, which ended up being a dunkin donuts run. I had a hot chocolate (to try to soothe the throat), a breakfast sandwhich (for calories), and a jelly and boston creme donut (for sweetness... and moar calories).
My breakfast consumed, I hit the street in search of a ride to Walmart. I had brought my pack, stuffed in a fairly inefficient way with my lighter gear to give it girth, and my trekking poles, which I now took out and extended. Now looking the part of a hiker (not a hobo) I started slowly walking backwards up the street, thumb out and poles and pack visible. I hadn't even walked a block which a pickup truck pulled over and picked me up, the owner coincidentally also heading to Walmart.
The ride was short and I thanked and said goodbye to my generous driver at the door and headed inside. This Walmart was the last Walmart near the trail according the SOBOs, so it was a shopping trip which had to count. I picked up a new knee brace (to replace the one which had exploded yesterday), dayquill and a decongestant, new headphones (for when the ones I have inevitably die), and some sundry foods to round out my food supplies to last me a couple days.
 Bags in hand I headed back to the road and repeated the process. Only a couple of minutes later a familiar pickup truck pulled up in front of me and I hopped in... the same guy heading home now. We chatted about bee keeping on the ride, since he kept several hives of bees and sold the honey they produced. Once again I thanked him and walked back to the barn. There I put my laundry in, desploded my pack, and watched the newest episode of Game of Thrones with Lost (who never misses an episode, even on trail). I also did a quick repair on my gaiters, sewing the velcro back onto the gaiter where it had begun to seperate from the fabric.
Lost and I decided that it didn't make sense to leave town without eating first, so we headed down to Welch's, the local diner, for second breakfast. Neither of us walked in that hungry, but I did end up eating ""The Hungryman"", so yea...
Finally ready, we donned our packs and prepared to hitch back to the trail when a guy I vaguely recognized walked in. The guy, Soggy, was chatting with some of the other hikers and offered a ride to anyone who needed it, which we did! We hopped in his car and on the short ride back to the trailhead I realized that I had met him before in Erwin, TN at Uncle Johnny's hostel where he was also giving rides to hikers, that time to go get food. It turns out that he's a trail angel from PA who typically does this sort of stuff during the hiking season... small world to see him again.
He dropped us off, gave us each a Gatorade, and we were off on a short road walk. I popped a dayquil to soothe my throat as we crossed a small hydro electric dam and passed several groups of SOBOs heading into town. Back into the woods the trail headed uphill and didn't stop. Though long, this uphill had switchbacks, was decently graded, and wasn't very rocky... all of which were a welcome change from the terrain we had been hiking on for the past couple days in the Whites. 
The trail topped out on a rocky bald and I waited for Lost there, occupying my time with trying to eat every blueberry I could find. She came, took a short rest and then continued on and I lingered a few minutes longer, finishing up a couple more bushes before shouldering my pack and walking on.
The trail dipped down into a valley as distant thunder rumbled through the mountains and a few raindrops began to fall. I stopped and put on my pack cover before proceeding, but that process seemed to have dissuaded the would-be rainstorm from wetting us any further, though the thunder continued to sound from behind us for some time longer. 
We climbed and descended several rocky hills as we made our way north, my throat becoming progressively more uncomfortable as the afternoon wore on and my water supply dwindled. Finally we reached a campsite, the 7mi mark for us today, and confirmed our decision to move on to the next shelter, 5mi distant. I refilled on water and popped another couple dayquill and we moved on.
We passed several beautiful alpine ponds as we walked, lillypads flowering on the water surface and dense coniferous trees bordering the body of water. We also climbed a couple more rocky inclines, passing one with an overlook with a single tent site, a great place to camp if we had thought ahead and filled up on water. Oh well.
We passed a final pond, only 2.2mi from the shelter and continued on, crossing several boardwalks over the muddy and marshy terrain. It was about this time that the wheels started to fall off the bus, both of us tripping far more often than normal just due to tiredness. We passed a final, final pond and descended a steep rocky section before emerging onto the pond which the shelter overlooked.
The shelter itself was located at the outlet of the pond, a small stream escaping the pond through the beaver dam and down a narrow rocky cravase and down a long hill to the valley below. The shelter's front face was oriented to provide a wide view of the valley below and mountains beyond. We filtered water, ate dinner, popped a few more decongestants, and bedded down, both tired from todays hike and our sickness. 
Outside the moon, despite being only half full, brightly lit the landscape from above and the light spilled in the front of the shelter. A few bright stars were visible, dotting the night sky with more sure to come once the last echos of day faded from the eastern sky and the moon set late tonight.
Tomorrow we tackle Mahousic Notch, the hardest mile on the AT in that it requires extensive scrambling and climbing through boulder caves to navigate. Usual times for the SOBOs to navigate it are ~2hr... for that one mile. The notch is so deep that there's apparently still snow and ice at the bottom... should be fun! 
We plan to camp tomorrow at a firetower just past Speck Pond shelter, perhaps my last chance to sleep in a firetower on my thru hike, which I've been trying to do for hundreds of miles.","Gorham, NH
",Gretian Pond Shelter,"Jul 31, Mon",11.80
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574046,"Well, I woke up no better than I went to bed. Now I had a fully sore throat as well as not being able to use my nose for breathing. I had a couple of apple turnovers for breakfast, trying to eat my heaviest food first, as well as some hot coco mix (which has powdered milk in it) combined with a chocolate breakfast drink (which you were normally supposed to mix with milk), trying to stay hydrated while sick.
Of course, as soon as we left camp the trail took a turn upwards, which quickly had me breathing heavily due to my reduced lung capacity. On the uphill I had to keep taking little sips of water to wet my throat, which because severely irritated if I let it dry out from my heavy breathing. The trail dipped briefly and then started climbing Mt Success, capped in fog, which I headed up into.
Though I normally prefer to just enjoy the peace and quiet of mornings, today I popped on a podcast and listened as I climbed, a welcome distraction to the additional discomfort of being ill on top of the normal discomfort of hiking. Soon enough the trail emerged from the trees and started winding its way across rocky islands which poked up out of the seas of small, wind-swept tress and shrubs which filled the gaps of the alpine terrain. Every time I emerged onto a new island I looked around to figure out if I had finally reached the summit and every time a slightly taller group of trees and rock waited just beyond. At first, all that I could see was fog but as I continued to climb bits of the landscape below began to peak out in between the disbursing clouds.
Sidenote: Both Lost and I are pretty much masters of snot rockets at this point. Hey, what else are you going to do when the nearest tissue is miles away and even if you had them there'd be no place to throw them away?
By the time I reached the summit (or what I assume to be the summit, due to the lack of further uphill, but not obvious due of the lack of signage) the fog had mostly broke and individual clouds could be seen flowing from New Hampshire into Maine where they'd rapidly disintegrate as more and more of the landscape became visible. I took a VR panorama (a panorama that should be viewable with a VR headset, which I've never used but think could be a cool way to experience/share this view) and a couple of normal pictures and a soon Lost hiked up.
I really was disappointed by the lack of a sign indicating the top of Mt Success (which would be a perfect photo op), but we moved on and started heading down. The way down had more than a few rock scrambles down long and steeply sloping slabs of granite which made progress slow. These scrambles did their best, but eventually we came to our next milestone, the NH-ME border! Mt Success was a fitting last NH peak to climb... 13 states down, 1 to go. And this maniac is home!
As if to acknowledge this achievement the next bit of trail had a number of pretty good rock scrambles which involved tossing/javelin-ing our hiking pole to the bottom and then rock climbing down to them, packs and all. We once again popped up and began flirting with tree line again as I pulled ahead of Lost and crossed Goose Eye. Several sets of rebar stairs pounded into rock faces later, I had a great view from the top, the Presidentals looming to the southwest, Sunday River Ski area to the southeast, Gorham to the west, and countless mountains and lakes spread out before me in every direction. I took a break up here to admire the view but the sun soon drove me from the peak due to the lack of shade. 
By this point I was pretty much out of water... on a normal day the liter of water I had started the morning with would've lasted me this long with no problem, but I had been drinking more today to keep my throat lubricated and so was running very low. I rationed the last of my water as best I could but as I descended onto a rocky alpine plateau I ran out, still a mile or two away from the next shelter and its water supply. 
As I hiked I switched to breathing exclusively through my nose, which the decongestants had cleared out for me. Though not very comfortable, I found breathing through my nose helped preserve the last bits of moisture in my throat and reduced the severity of the soreness, though it was uncomfortable nonetheless. I hiked over countless mud puddles and I headed for the shelter, but nothing even close to a stream that I could filter for water.
Though I passed a number of blueberry bushes which had just began to bear fruit I didn't partake as I found that the small, tart berries didn't agree with my throat. After another steep downhill I finally came to the shelter, dropped my pack, and immediately headed to the spring where I quickly filtered some water to ease my throat.
Once again comfortable, I headed back up to the shelter, had lunch, and was joined by MuscleBear and a couple of other SOBOs. We chatted while I rested and waited for Lost, who rolled in in much the same situation that I had, out of water. We hung out until 3pm at which point we started heading for our next obstacle.... Mahoosuc Notch.
Listed in AWOL as the ""toughest"" mile on the AT, the notch is a literal boulderfield with car sized boulders stacked on top of eachother, requiring extensive scrambling, some climbing, and some splelunking to navigate. It had taken two of the hikers we had met at the last shelter 2 hours to navigate this one mile of trail. 
As we descended down into the notch the temperature dropped considerably... someone had turned on the AC and a light fog hung in the air in the lowest parts of the gorge, especially in the dark spaces which sank down between some of the boulders. We passed a hiker who had taken a full three hours to navigate the obstacle course, and we headed in. Though there are some blazes in the notch, they're more of a guideline than an actual rule, and there are usually multiple ways around an obstacle, usually a low route which weaves in between the boulders and a high route that hops along the tops of them.
Being pretty comfortable with rock climbing and rock hopping, I tended to prefer the high routes whereas Lost, who isn't terribly friendly with heights, tended to prefer the low route. Sometimes though, a well worn trail would climb up over, or around, or under a boulder and then dead-end in a cliff, wall, or space too small to squeeze through, so some care had to be taken to plan a route. The path that most hikers take, presumably the path of least resistance, was pretty obvious in most places and so we tried to stick with it as best we could. 
Partway through the gorge a river joined from the western wall and started flowing along the bottom, far our of our reach under the giant rock pile but audible at certain times along the way. This river allowed me to refill my water halfway through so that I could stay plenty hydrated as we worked our way through, alieveiating the concerns of this morning. All and all, I had a great time. I wouldn't call this the ""toughest"" mile of the AT... definitely the slowest mile, probably the most interesting mile, but not the hardest.
Lost, being 5ft tall, had a lot more trouble with many parts of this mile than I did... some obstacles that I could stride over she couldn't quite jump, some handholds I used were out of her reach, some footholds and rock faces that would hold my weight she couldn't generate the friction to stick to, so it was much more difficult for her than for I. A couple times, for the sake of expediency, I had to give Lost a boost or take her pack over an obstacle due to her small stature, but we made it through the labyrinth in a total of 2hr and 45min. I think coming back and doing the notch again, on my own, perhaps without a pack would be a lot of fun some day... definitely an interesting section of trail.
Back on (relatively) flat ground, despite the late hour (~7pm), we decided to keep to the plan and push on for the firetower at the top of Old Speck, which we were hoping would be pretty spectacular on a high as clear as this one. We started heading up Mahoosuc arm and ran into extremely steep scrambling up sheer rock faces, sometimes with only a couple of roots at the side for assistance. 
Though pretty fatigued from today's hiking, we managed to get up to the top just as the light failed us and we broke out our headlamps. Well, broke out my headlamp anyways, since apparently Lost's broke or has dead batteries. Lost, who was leading the way, got my headlamp while I followed behind, content to hike the light of the moon anyways.
By the time we reached Speck Pond campsite the only light coming from the sky was that of the moon. Lost had decided that the last 1.1mi up to the firetower wasn't happening for her tonight, and was planning on stopping at the campsite. I was planning on pushing on to the tower, eager for the chance to cowboy camp atop it.
 Having nearly circumnavigated the pond we stopped and took a rest on a rock, looking over the still pond, dotted with lillypads, and the sky, speckled with an ever increasing number of stars. We hung out there for a while and chatted, listening to the occasional croaks of the bullfrogs-bears which, along with our quiet conversation, broke the otherwise complete silence. While sitting and enjoying the celestial show we saw a plane or two, a few satellites, and a shooting star, but at last, with our lack of movement, we grew cold in the night air and decided to move on. By this point (10pm) my will to hike had faded, and so I decided to just stay at the campsite as well. As soon as we stood up and turned the headlamp back on, it illuminated the sign for the campsite, which we had unknowingly stopped just 20ft short of.
We headed into the campsite, designated ourselves a large group, and claimed one of the large group tent pads so as not to disturb the hikers sleeping in the shelter while we made dinner. Soon after we setup out sleeping pads and bags directly on the tent pad and drifted off to sleep under the blanket of stars above.","Gretian Pond Shelter
",Speck Pond Campsite,"Aug 01, Tue",14.70
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574047,"I woke up a few times throughout the night for various reasons... when my nose had filled up so that I could take more decongestants, to water the grass... and each time the stars shown brightly above, the milky way on full display in the heavens above, even some of the nebulae visible as dark splotches amidst the diffuse glow of countless stars. Alas, I woke up at around 4am to see the first light of the new day start to block out the stars and when I next awoke at 7am they had all disappeared save for the closest star.
We had decided that we deserved to sleep in this morning since we had been up until 11pm once dinner was all said and done. We lazily packed up and was visited by the site caretaker who we hadn't registered with last night since we had gotten in so late. This campsite, because its in a high use area, has an AMC caretaker and so they collect a fee for anyone who stays at the site. I was a little bit disappointed... I had thus far managed to avoid having to pay for a campsite on the AT and this is the last one on the trail, but oh well. 
Before hitting the trail I called and reserved a cabin for the night in Andover, ME since I wanted to get off trail for a night to be a little more comfortable while my cold ran its course and we were both game for a shower. We planned to do 14mi today to get to the first trailhead which led into Andover which would bring us the rest of the way over Old Speck and then over Baldplate Mt before hitting town.
We hit the trail at ~830am and climbed up the last 600ft to the summit of Old Spec Mt. The climb was fun... nothing like a couple scrambles up some sheer rock faces to wake you up in the morning. The actual summit of the mountain was 0.3mi of the AT, but I headed up to check it out. The top of the firetower was a small wooden platform, enclosed with handrails and would've been an awesome place to cowboy camp. Oh well... next time.
From the top the Whites were still visible behind me and the sheer rock faces of Grafton Notch, dropping hundreds of feet and shimmering as water dripped down then, were laid out before me. The full seven peaks of Sunday River ski area were visible but overall the landscape was relatively untouched by human activity, a welcome sight up here in the mountanous north as it had been in the southern mountains. 
I lingered for a while at the top, enjoying a couple snacks before heading down and back to the trail for a long descent. Again today I popped in some podcasts to take my mind off my sickness and cruised down the hill. At the bottom I waited for Lost at the crossing of Rt26. 
As soon as she arrived she asked if I wanted to find a ride into town. I had just spent the last couple minutes thinking about how much the next 10mi were going to suck to hike and how we probably wouldn't get to town until pretty late, so I was game. The only wrinkle was that we were deep down in Grafton Notch, didn't know which way on the road led to Andover, and had no service. We tried to flag a couple cars down but only managed to get a french canadian to stop for us, but she wasn't familiar with the area. We tried a couple of day hikers from the parking lot, but they were from CT and also weren't familiar with the area (and had no extra room in their car). 
Finally a dad and son emerged from the woods after completing their day hike and agreed to give us a ride in the direction they were headed. We hopped in and chatted with them on the ride... they didn't seem to be very interested in anything more than short day hikes and didn't seem to fully grasp (or be interested in grasping) what we were doing, but that's fine. They dropped us at the corner of Rt26 and Rt2, where they needed to head south and we needed to head East.
At that corner, as we were preparing to try to find another hitch for the next leg of our journey, we walked past and greeted a cyclist. It turns out that she biked here from Vancouver over the course of 40days for a friend's wedding, and her boyfriend was in the area and had a pickup truck, so she volunteered him to drive us the rest of the way. She had done the Long Trail a couple of years ago, and so as a backpacker and long distance cyclist understood our plight. She gave him a call, told him the plan, and he pulled up a couple minutes later with a bag full of fruit, which she took her fill of and then gave the rest to us. What TRAIL MAGIC! We piled our packs in the back and were off, zooming towards Andover many times faster than we could've hiked.
We chatted on the drive and he was much more interested in the lifestyle and our adventures on the trail than our last ride had been, and we had fun trading stories of his cycling adventures too. He dropped us right at the door of our hostel... man, what an awesome way to get around.
We checked in and headed into town... I picked up my package from the post office (containing some heavier clothing, which I don't think I'll need now that I'm out of the Whites, but oh well), got a burger at the restaurant/hostel, and hit the restaurant/store to pick up a couple of miscellaneous food items to round out my supplies for another couple days of hiking. As we were walking back we got rained on in bright sunshine... no cloud visible in the sky above us... strange weather.
It turns out the cabin we got wasn't in town, but was actually a couple miles outside of town, so we got our shuttle out to the cabin. At first I was pretty unimpressed with the cabin... the studs were uncovered inside and the siding was just plywood, the minifridge and hotplate plugged into a power strip which was the only electricity in the place (save a single hanging lamp which is the only light), and the bathhouse, while clean, wasn't anything to write home about. Over the course of the afternoon the atmosphere really made it work... it was quiet, just the noise of the wind and an occasional car going by broke the peace, and the cabin had no wifi or cell service, so no outside distractions were available. 
To pass the time I journaled, organized my pack, and just relaxed on the couch on the porch, a great afternoon. As evening struck Lost and I watched a couple episodes of Park and Rec on her ipad while we ate dinner. Towards the evening I was finally feeling better to the point where I didn't need medicine to stem the flow of mucus from my nose and so Lost and I finally split the cider that I had been carrying since Gorham but hadn't been well enough to drink... 1.5lbs off my back tomorrow!
All and all, today turned into an awesome day, chill and relaxed, just what the doctor ordered.
We'll head back into town tomorrow and I'm going to send a package home with a couple of spare gear items I don't need anymore... just a little less weight to carry for the last couple hundred miles. We'll probably get breakfast in town and then get a shuttle back to the trail and tackle Baldplate Mt. I think the weather is supposed to go downhill for the rest of the week with some rain in the forecast, but we'll see!","Speck Pond Campsite
",Grafton Notch,"Aug 02, Wed",4.60
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574049,"I woke up this morning a pretty stuffed up... about the same as I had one previous mornings, but at least the sore throat was gone. Hopefully this bodes well for hiking today. We got up at around 630 and lazily packed up in time for our 730 shuttle back to town. Lost didn't sleep well and her knees are still really bothering her, so she's going to zero today. We'll grab breakfast in town before I catch a shuttle back to Grafton to pick up where we left off yesterday.
We went back to the Little Red Hen for breakfast because it was the only place in town that had cars in front of it (all 3 food venues/stores in town are across the street from eachother). I got the Hungry Hiker, which it seems that every trail town has a version of, but was a little disappointed by the food which I can only describe as ok. 
After breakfast I had to head back to the hostel to catch my ride to trail while Lost stayed in town. We didn't say goodbye, but rather she promised to catch up and I agreed that I'd see her up the trail. Its hard to tell with how fluid the trail is, but I'm pretty sure that those statements are true, but only time will tell.
The shuttle back to Grafton Notch took the better part of 45min and wound over miles and miles of back roads and I was back on trail by about 945am. I crossed Rt26 and started heading up Baldpate Mt. The fact that I was climbing a mountain was immediately obvious as the trail climbed higher and higher. Today, as opposed to the past couple days, the exertion and heavy breathing seemed to help to clear my nose, drying out the remaining mucus, and my throat didn't worsen as I breathed through my mouth... maybe I am getting better! 
The trail followed stone steps up the side of the mountain in many places which must've taken an immense amount of effort by the trail crews to build. Personally I'm not a huge fan of steps... the trail crews do their best but when using the local materials the steps tend to come out pretty uneven, some requiring a huge leg lift to mount and some causing studder steps to hit, which breaks up the rhythm of hiking. I can understand that they help prevent erosion, which is definitely an advantage, and they're there, so I climbed them.
Eventually the endless staircase left behind the deciduous trees and ascended through the conifers, which gradually became shorter and shorter until I could see above them. The trail popped up onto the summit of the west peak and ahead of me I could see the rocky summit of the east peak, my next destination, and a couple of tiny figures working their way up its face. I passed a group of younger kids and chatted with them for a few minutes while I picked and ate some blueberries before continuing on. 
I climbed down a ladder and a bit of steep trail and emerged onto the large rocky faces which comprised the saddle between the two peaks and followed the rocks as they bent upward towards the east peak. The entire eastern side of the easter peak was a singe large slab of rock, inclined at at least 45deg, which I was able to scramble/climb up, but I was sure glad it wasn't wet otherwise this would've been seriously tough and alot more dangerous. 
At the summit I passed a couple of hikers enjoying a break and I took a couple minutes myself to take in the views. On their way past I finally made the connection as to why one of the hikers looked familiar at the same time she did... it was Marshmallow! I had first met her in the Shenendoah's where she had saved the day with some Pepto Bismol during my food poisoning and I had last seen her in southern PA. We chatted for a while, she had decided to flip up to Maine and hike south when she got to CT and had found someone to key swap with which meant that she got to choose which direction to do each section of trail and could slackpack every day.
Finally she had to move on to catch up with her hiking buddies and I lingered on the summit for a few additional minutes before a low rumble of thunder convinced me that it was probably a good idea to get moving. The descent involved many sloping rock faces, but since these were eastward facing and hadn't gotten the sun's warmth, were still wet. I slipped multiple times coming down even while taking this section slow and carefully, thankfully never bad enough to do any damage, but there were some slabs which simply didn't have anything to hang onto. 
Eventually the trail mellowed out and I came to Frye Notch Shelter where I took a couple minutes to snack and chatted with Dishes. She was doing the vehicle slackpack with Marshmallow but was thinking about quitting the trail, even though she had already done 1500+ miles. She just wasn't enjoying the hiking and this certainly isn't an activity for someone who doesn't enjoy hiking. I honestly found it hard to relate... all of the scenery up here is so stunning and even the terrain is more interesting and exciting that your average hiking trail. But I had also noticed that she hiked with 2 earbuds in and had kinda sped past Marshmallow and I at the summit of the mountain, so I could definitely understand how you could not enjoy hiking if you choose to block out everything that you're hiking through. To each their own... Hopefully she figures out what's best for her.
I continued down the mountain, and by that I mean that I climbed the next hill, at the top of which the thunder really started to rumble. Not long after a light rain began to fall and so I started to double time off the mountain as best I could as the storm rolled in. The rain intensified, but I already wasn't wearing a shirt and my pack cover was already on, so there wasn't really much the rain could do to me. Small puddles on the trail grew into bigger puddles, some several inches deep, and some sneakily camoflaged under a layer of leaves or pine needles to better blend in with the trail and trick an unsuspecting hiker into stepping there.
As the thunder rumbled all around the sun actually started to come out and I found myself hiking behind an ever-advancing rainbow, which was pretty magical. What interesting weather! My second sun shower in two days.
Just then a huge crack blindsided me from the left side and I dropped low to the ground out of instinct. I don't know where exactly it hit, but the ringing in my left ear indicated that it was much much too close for comfort. Being off this mountain had instantly become my top priority and so I started booking it down the mountain fueled with adrenaline. Even the summit of this smaller mountain had been wooded, and I had descended quite a bit since then, but I guess lightning can strike anywhere in a storm, and so I once again found myself running down a mountain in a thunderstorm (something that I honestly haven't had to do in a while given how often it had happened in the first couple hundred miles of my hike).
The streams were all swollen with the recent rain but by this point my shoes were soaked through anyways, so I just walked straight through them and after a few more ups and downs found myself at one of the trailheads for Andover. There I found Marshmallow and her car and I hung out for a while to dry myself and my gear off in the warm sun. I hung out for about an hour, occasionally rotating my gear to get it all dry, before finally getting moving again at ~4pm. 
The next couple miles of trail were a gradual climb over pretty easy terrain, which passed relatively quickly. Even so, I got rained on again, quickly re-wetting my shoes, pack cover, and me, but by the time I made it to the shelter the weather had passed. 
I arrived to find no one else here at 630pm, a likely sign that I'd be spending tonight alone. This shelter, being located between the two trailheads for Andover, does't seem to see much use. I debated moving on since I prefer to camp with at least a couple people around, but the next campsite was 4mi farther and involved a 1600ft descent, 1400ft climb, and another 1000ft descent. With the late hour and the upcoming terrain, I wasn't sure I could do those miles in the ~2hr of good daylight I had left and I had no desire to do it in the dark. The log book didn't indicate any problems with the area, so for tonight, this was home. For someone who started ""in the bubble"" with hundreds of other people around for the first couple weeks, it really is amazing to end up sleeping alone at a shelter.
I made dinner and did my camp chores while listening to a podcast. While I'm a fan of solitude, I found too much of the utter silence caused by the lack of wind, water, animals, or people a little unnerving. At dusk the local shelter mouse, which I had seen reference to in the log, came out. I really didn't feel like dealing with a mouse all night (or the bugs for that matter), so I managed to setup my tent in the shelter to give me a little privacy from them for the night.","Grafton Notch
",Hall Mt Lean-to,"Aug 03, Thu",16.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574763,"I took a litte while to get moving this morning. I was quite cozy in my tent in my shelter all night, no issues with bugs or mice. Part of my morning was communicating with Lost and Lookout. As of this morning, Lookout is about 40mi ahead of me, but is planning on zeroing in Monson and is looking to summit Katahdin on the 19th, so I think I can probably catch him before the 100mi wilderness and potentially summit with him (we both stood on the summit of Springer at the same time and both think it would be kinda cool to summit Katahdin on the same day). Lost is going to be getting back on trail in Stratton, about 62mi ahead of me and will probably be doing fewer miles than Lookout, but not zeroing. Either way, I think I can catch them in a couple days if I can crank out some miles. Today I'm planning a 21mi day which will involve a lot of elevation, but I'm confident that I can make it, one way or another.
There's nothing quite like getting back into wet clothing and this morning was about average. None of my stuff had dried overnight, but I slowly changed into it as I got ready, giving each part a little time to warm up to body temperature so as to lessen the shock of doing it all at once.
I eventually got rolling at 740am, probably much later than I should've for how many miles I'm planning on doing, but whatever, I'll make it. I immediately started heading downhill, dropping 1600ft of elevation. Though I expected some steep, rocky scrambles like I had grown accustomed to seeing in this kind of terrain, it never came, and the trail remained dirt (though still pretty steep) the whole way down. I crossed a stream and managed to slip in and (re)wet my left shoe, which was still wet from yesterday. 
Next, I climbed back up the other side of the notch, rising 1400ft through the foggy morning, passing an overlook or two but not bothering to stop to see the foggy sights. While steep, the trail crew had been pretty good about driving rebar steps and handrails into the rocky faces and so this section also was pretty manageable, even while wet. 
Finally I crested the hill and started heading down 1000ft to the road, which passed pretty quickly. Overall, I think that had I wanted to, I could've handled doing this last night, but hindsight isn't very useful in a decision making process and I ended up having a good night up at Hall Mt shelter, so no harm done. 
I crossed the road and talked with a SOBO, LoneWolf, who was getting off trail to get a toothache checked out, certainly not a good problem to have in the middle of the woods. I continued on after reading the info sign that I've found at all road crossings in ME, which explain the terrain in the following section, the water sources, and any shelter available, very good info for a hiker to have. The sign explained that this next section had about 3700ft of elevation gain in it, which added to the 1400ft I had already done would make this a pretty good workout today.
I now climbed up the other side of the gap that the road wound through and up the side of Old Blue Mt, which seemed to go on forever. I had been trying to keep moving pretty briskly today and I was starting to feel it, my legs requiring that I slow down on some of the steeper sections as the elevation started to take it toll.
I ended up having a quick lunch on the summit and watched as the clouds billowed by, a view in and of themselves to make up for the landscape they obscured. I didn't linger long and kept moving, heading for Beavis Mt. Along the way I started to get discouraged... I hadn't seen hardly anyone all day, all my clothes were still wet from yesterdays rain and today's plants, and I was trying to crank out these miles to catch up with my friends and was getting annoyed that I couldn't move faster even despite this tough terrain. 
Usually I enjoy hiking and don't mind if the terrain is a bit slow or if I stop to enjoy part of the trail... I have nowhere better to be generally and this hike is about enjoying my time on the trail, but today I just couldn't get into that mindset. I eventually decided that I had to abandon the goal of catching Lost and Lookout as soon as possible... doing miles too fast to enjoy them wasn't going to get me anywhere but into an unhappy state. In the end, at least a hike of this magnitude, is a solo endeavor and I decided that I didn't want to finish my hike running through the most beautiful state on the trail. 
I had made a similar decision after I had gotten out of sync with Lookout in PA, that I had to hike my own hike and see how things worked out, and just like then, suddenly things got a lot more fun. I decided that instead of blowing straight through Rangely tomorrow that I'd probably do a 10mi day and stay in town to dry off a little and get some good food. The sun started peaking out through the clouds. I ran into some blueberry bushes atop Beavis Mt and spent a looooong time eating my fill... and then some... actually, eating until I had given myself a stomach ache from them and forced myself to keep walking. 
I headed down off of Beavis and came to some TRAIL MAGIC right before crossing a dirt road, a couple of wooden benches with a cooler full of goodies! Well, actually, an empty cooler that just this morning (according to the note) had been full of watermelon and drinks and snacks. Talk about an emotional roller coaster, the excitement of seeing magic turning into crushing disappointment at missing things that I hadn't even been craving until I found out they were gone. TRAIL TRAGIC.
I crossed another stream and managed to slip again and soak my left shoe, which had almost dried out by that point. Wah Wah. I headed up towards Rt17 just as the rumble of thunder started to echo down the valley... just what I needed... The rain came just as I reached the road. I stopped briefly to pick some raspberries anyways, but was forced to move on as the storm crackled above me and the rain started coming sideways. 
As I crossed the road to my left a large lake glistened in the afternoon soon and to my right a huge wall of gray was slowly swallowing everything, including the mountains I had just come over. I scampered across the road quickly, not eager to be near the big metal guardrail for longer than I had to be, and headed up into the woods which gave me a bit of shelter from the driving wind and sideways rain. I again took a quick glance at the summary for this section of trail which was posted to a tree at the trailhead... the words ""there are no major mountains in this 13mi section"" may have been the most beautiful thing I've ever read.
The storm blew itself out as quickly as it had come it, only lasting about 20min, but the rain had been plenty to re-wet all of the plants, the trail, and me. The last couple miles to camp went slowly, but I still pulled in a little before 6pm, not bad timing for 21mi. I elected to stay in the shelter since it seems likely we'll be getting more rain. The water source for this shelter is a large pond, only about 100ft from the shelter... only in maine are the ponds nice enough to be used for water. 
Today was a bit of a rollercoaster, but overall wasn't bad. I'm going to try to make some extra miles where I can, but am not planning on trying to push it like I did today. We'll see what happens, I'm pretty confident that I'll catch Lookout and Lost one way or another, but either way, I plan to do it with a mindset that still allows me to have fun.
Like I said earlier, I think I'm only going to do 10mi into Rangely tomorrow and will stay in town for the night. Then it should only be about 1.5days to Stratton, which I probably won't stay in, and then another 2 days to Caratunk, where I'm meeting up with my uncle for the night. Then its just another 2days to Monson, probably 5-6days through the 100mi, and then I'll be at Katahdin.","Hall Mt Lean-to
",Sabbath Day Pond,"Aug 04, Fri",21.10
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574765,"I woke up this morning to my 530 alarm, turned it off, and rolled over for another 30min of sleep. The 6am alarm was enough to rouse me and I slowly began getting ready to get moving. As I did I chatted with Alias, who by the time I was packed up and saddled up had yet to emerge from his sleeping bag. He was thinking he might wait out the rain.
For the NOBOs we have a saying... ""No pain, no rain, no Maine"" which means if you don't hike through the pain, and you don't hike in the rain, you're not going to make it out of maine. I haven't decided if, for SOBOs, that last bit should read ""you're not going to make it out of Maine"" or if they should just go with ""No pain, no rain, no Georgia"". Either way, I was hiking today and I hit the trail just after 7am, walking back down to the pond and then heading north.
Just because a section doesn't have any mountains doesn't mean its flat. Not by any means. At least in AWOL, the scale of the elevation plot hides a lot of little ups and downs which don't feel so little as you're going over them. My morning had a bunch of those, interspersed with boggy/muddy regions which had me hopping from root to root. Of course, eventually I missed a step and my (still not dry) shoe ended up in a mud puddle, but at least I could look forward to getting dry in town.
I passed a group of girls speaking french and took a break at a campsite on a pond and called and setup my shuttle into town and hostel for the night. The last 4.8mi to the road came pretty easy and I was moving pretty fast, eager to get to town and a shower and laundry and eager to avoid the imminent rain. As I hiked towards the road I hit a beautiful section of trail... I don't mean that the scenery was beautiful, I mean the trail itself was beautiful (at least to my eyes). In what must've been a heroic feet of strength and persistence, the MATC trail crews had dug a drainage ditch along the trail and piled the soil up to raise the trail, in the process covering all the roots and rocks. For 100 glorious yards it felt like I was back on the nice flat, dirt trails of Virginia and I hit 3mph pace for a couple of seconds before that section ended and I was back to the uneven, root covered, muddy maine trails. It was nice while it lasted.
A light sprinkle did begin to fall in my final mile but my yell of ""Really?! 1/2 mile from town?!"" convinced it otherwise and the weather held until I reached the road. My shuttle was there waiting for me and I hopped in and off we went to town. The driver was a hiker who had hiked from CT to ME from February to June of this year and so he relayed some stories of the trail in the winter months, feet of snow, constant snowstorms, etc. 
Finally we arrived at a large farmhouse (appropriately named the Farmhouse Inn) and I was shown the packroom, my bunk in the bunkroom, the hiker kitchen and common area and left to my own devices. I did notice in the log that Lookout was here 2 days ago... I'm not too far behind!
I showered (as usually a little disgusted with the color of the initial water to wash off of me) and then hung out in the common area and kitchen, waiting for the 1pm shuttle to town. I ended up having some leftover hotdogs and corn from last night's cookout for someone's birthday and some cherries and strawberries that someone had left in the fridge for the hikers. 
The shuttle into town was pretty quick and stopped at the ice cream stand where I got out and headed to the library to use their computer to do a little planning for my finish. Spreadsheets are hard to manipulate on a phone... much easier on a computer. Next I headed up the laundramat to wash my clothes, and then up to the grocery store for my resupply. After shopping I headed out to the street and started hitching a ride back to the hostel, not wanting to walk with all my groceries. 
It didn't take long for me to get a hitch from a guy who apparently spent a good deal of his youth hitching as a mode of transportation. I didn't realize quite how close I actually was to the hostel since I had had a ride into town and had then walked to the grocery store... it turned out to only be about half a mile which I felt a little bad hitching.
I organized my new food into my food bag and then hung out for the rest of the afternoon, just chilling on the couches and enjoying a couple of the ciders I had picked up at the store. The bunkhouse emptied out as the dinnertime shuttles left for town, leaving just me handing around. Soon enough 501 and 2 other section NOBOs wandered in, apparently having just woken up from a nap. They had picked up spaghetti, sauce, ground beef, and garlic bread at the store earlier and had volunteered that anyone who pitched in some food could partake in the communal dinner, so I had supplemented what they bought with some extra (to feed more hikers) on my trip to the store.
In no time we had the pasta cooked, the beef browned and added to the warmed sauce, and the bread heated and dug in. We cooked basically everything we had bought and ended up with way too much (which was part of the plan), however all the rest of the hikers had gone into town to eat (which was not part of the plan), leaving just the 4 of us. We offered some to the hostel owners and the husband ended up taking us up on our offer and joined us for a bit. We stilled ended up with a ton of leftovers which we just threw in the fridge labeled ""free'... they won't last long.","Sabbath Day Pond
",Rangely,"Aug 05, Sat",9.40
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574766,"I had signed up for the early shuttle, which left at 630, which meant that I was up bright and early despite having slept inside (which usually ends up in sleeping at least a little later). I repacked all my gear and had a quick breakfast consisting of 2 breakfast essentials/hot coco drinks and a bowl of leftover spaghetti (I told you someone would eat it)...
We crammed 8 hikers and all our gear into the suburban and hit the road, heading back to the trail. The sky was gray and the temperature cool, but the forecast had predicted that it would clear, so overall it should be a pretty good day for a hike.
We got to the trailhead and I and a couple others grabbed our gear and went our respective directions. A number of the hikers were slackpacking back here tonight and so would be dropped off at another trailhead 16mi up the trail and I would pass them partway through my day today, so they hung around for the last leg of their shuttle. I crossed the road and headed into the woods.
As I did I came across another info sign stating that I was entering the 9th section of the AT in maine (its kinda cool how they're counting down to Katahdin) and that I would be crossing Saddleback, Sugarloaf, and the Carters in the next 32mi and to expect 9600ft of elevation gain over those miles. To put that in perspective, that's 1/3 of an everest. Gulp. Because these signs are unique to maine I haven't really been tracking how much elevation I've been doing, but that seems like alot. Here goes nothing!
The trail crossed a number of streams and was generally pretty wet as I passed a couple of alpine ponds. I passed Piazza Rock/cave/pond/shelter, which looks like a cool place to explore for a day when I have more time. The trail rose steadily but not too strenuously at first and I hopped over the roots and rocks to avoid the muddy and wet trail. As I hiked the sun seemed to threaten to break through, the world around me getting bright for a few moments before fading back to the ambient gray lighting of a cloudy day. I was hoping that the clouds would break before I hit the summit of Saddleback, which is supposed to have some pretty great views, but we'd see.
Eventually the trail took a steep turn uphill and the hike became a lot more like a climb up the moist and slippery rocks. As I usually do I stowed one of my poles on my side so that I had one hand free to grasp rocks and pull myself up and kept the pole in the other to aid in steadying myself on the rocks. As I rose the trees started to get shorter and I could hear the wind above me in the tops of the trees. I would say that the wind whistled or howled through the trees above me, but those would well describe its strength but mischaracterize its sound, which was more of a varying strength whoosh.
Nevertheless, I continued climbing, donning my windbreaker to better protect myself when I finally got above treeline. I passed a sign which prohibited camping for the next 3mi while above treeline and then I was up. The clouds flew past me, briefly opening to reveal a world far below enjoying a sunny day, but up here the sun couldn't reach me through the thick layer of clouds which veiled the summit (or which the mountain was creating...).
Coming up above treeline was a different world. The mountain side was uneven with large shelves of rock protruding from the side and every time I'd top one I'd find the wind even stronger than it had been below. A couple times some small trees had found purchase in a small area of the mountain and I stopped in those thickets to regroup and warm my hands. The morning had been chilly down at lower elevation and it gave the wind a strong bite. As I progressed towards the summit it drained all exposed skin of warmth and I had to keep moving to try to keep warm.
I finally reached the summit, a single, lone sign standing on a gentle dome of rock, paused for a quick picture, and then continued on before I lost too much warmth. Even the windbreaker wasn't fully protecting me anymore and I could feel a chill start to set in and had to keep moving to generate the warmth to combat it. I kept snacking as often as possible, whenever I found a slightly sheltered area, trying to make sure that my body had the calories it needed to generate heat and keep moving.
I continued down into the saddle which was sheltered from the wind a bit more than the summit had been, but at least at the summit the intense wind had scoured all the water off the rocks whereas down here they were all moist and slippery, making the going slow. I passed the Berry Picker's trail, which a sign explained was a trail that locals had been using to access the blueberries and cranberries which grew on the mountain, and was disappointed that I couldn't go explore it, but that would have to wait for another trip as I couldn't afford to spend more time above treeline with the weather the way it was.
Soon the trail headed back up onto exposed rock faces as I made my way onto The Horn and the wind returned stronger than ever. One gust took my hat off and I barely managed to spear it with my trekking pole before it flew off. After that I gave up on wearing it and attached it to my hipbelt since it wasn't really helping anyways. During the gusts I ended up having to use my trekking poles to brace myself against the wind which threatened to knock me over a couple of times. This was definitely not the 25-40mph winds that I saw predicted... this was more in the 60-70mph range.
I crested the horn and again didn't linger. The trail dropped precipitously after the horn but was thankfully better sheltered from the wind and I was able to take my time descending the steep and wet rocks and back down into the forest. I came to a campsite and, though it was only 930am, had some lunch to try to replenish some of my energy as I was pretty exhausted after just those couple miles. 
Next up I had Saddleback Junior which was thankfully below the clouds and not subject to as much wind. There were plenty of blueberries at the top, but I only stopped to eat a few on my way over and passed a couple of the slackers from the Farmhouse Inn who I warned about the winds at the top as I passed. I took another lunch break at Poplar Ridge Lean-to where i ran into a hiking group from the AT conference (which is being held in Maine this week) and one of them gave me TRAIL MAGIC in the form of their extra lunch food which was a homemade granola bar and an apple.
While looking at AWOL I noticed that the distance between Rangely and Stratton was only 32mi, not the 40 that I had thought it was. Since my uncle is going to pick me up from the trail tomorrow for a night at his house, that was going to make for a short day tomorrow once I completed the 19mi I had planned for today. Unfortunately, with the spacing of the roads I didn't really see a way around that unless I did 34mi today and another 16 tomorrow to get to the next road, which wasn't really feasible. Oh well.
I got moving again and headed downhill until I reached a river. Maine doesn't really believe in bridges over any river large enough that you can't step over it, and so fording rivers is one of the unique aspects of the AT in maine as compared to other states. The recent rains had swelled this river, covering the rocks that I'd normally be able to use to cross the river with 6in of water, so I had no choice. I didn't want to get my hiking shoes wet, as this was the first time in 3 days that they had actually been dry, so off they came and on went my camp sandals. After using the stepping stones to cross I reversed the process and in no time was back to hiking.
The trail for the next couples miles sloped gradually uphill, pretty much my favorite type of terrain (next to flat, anyways, but everyone knows that that doesn't actually exist), and I cruised. The climb up Lone Mt became steeper but then leveled off again all the way to Spaulding Ridge Lean-to. I got to the shelter, my intended destination for the night, a little before 3pm, which was a little early to stop for the day. I had done 19mi, but as I had determined earlier, my option was really to do another 14 or to stop here for the night. Eh... I could probably do another 14mi in 6 or so hours, which would only mean about an hour of night hiking...
Fiiine. I packed up and headed out, trying to move fast to maximize my use of the remaining daylight but also starting to feel the fatigue start to set in. I walked over the last mile of AT to have been completed in 1937 just past Sugarloaf and then started heading steeply downhill towards my crossing of the Carabasset River. If it weren't for this river cutting this mountain range in half the trail would've had a lot less elevation gain today, but alas it had, and so I headed down.
Someone had kindly provided a plank which spanned the widest part of the river and the rest was passable via rock hopping. In my infinite smoothness I dropped a trekking pole in the river while returning a wave from a girl who was lounging along its bank in the fading sun. Thankfully it didn't wash down stream. I headed straight back uphill on the other side of the river, re-climbing back up to my former elevation to summit another three mountains. While I initially questioned the necessity of climbing back up here, there were a couple of spectacular views of the Carabasset Valley with the sun starting to set that I stopped for a moment to admire.
By this point my legs were dead and I had to summon strength to help them climb the last peak of my day, thankful that the rest of my hike would be downhill. By this time I had popped in some podcasts and was listening to those to pass the time as I headed downhill towards the road. The downhill stretched on for what seemed like forever as the sun sank and began coloring the sky.
Just as I had resigned myself to finishing my hike for the day in the dark I found it. The 2000 mile mark! If I had to describe my feeling at the moment I would have to go with overwhelming tiredness with a hint of pride. Not only had I hiked 2000mi over the past 4 months, I had reached this milestone on what would be one of my longest days on trail. Go me!
I will say that I was a little bit disappointed with the marker, just a couple of small sticks on the ground to spell out 2000, but I continued on. And found the 2000 mile marker! Again! This time made out of birch limbs and a much more satisfying size. I took a couple more pictures with this sign, checked my GPS and confirmed that this one was actually in the correct place, and then continued on after switching out my hat for my headlamp. 
It wasn't long until I came to the road and crossed it and found another 2000mi mark! I finished the last 2mi to camp in full dark with my headlamp, arriving just after 9pm and completing my 34mi day, my longest day on trail so far which included 9600ft of elevation gain (~1/3 of an Everest), which is  some of the roughest terrain I've seen. Today was a good day.
I setup my tent next to a couple of others and had a quick dinner, enjoying the cider I had packed out of the hostel as I ate before drifting off to sleep under the full moon peaking through the canopy above.","Rangely
",Cranberry stream campsite,"Aug 06, Sun",34
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575190,"As usual, night hikes entitle me to sleeping in, so I rolled over when it started getting light outside, silenced my first alarm at 530, and begrudgingly sat up when my 6am alarm sounded. I made breakfast in bed, enjoying two apple turnovers and a breakfast drink from the comfort and warmth of my quilt and tent.
I had arranged to meet my uncle at a road crossing 16mi distant at 4pm, however I was crossing the Bigelows today, a total of 6000ft of elevation gain over rocky summits, which would surely impact my pace. As such, I decided that I should probably get moving as early as possible and was packed and moving at 7am. The other campers around me were just starting to emerge from their tents as I pulled out of the site. I caught a few words of what they said as they got up and they were speaking a mixture of french and english, presumably canadians down for a camping trip.
As I left camp I passed yet another 2000mi marker, this one more than 3mi off of the actual 2000mi mark for this year, and so likely older than the others I had seen. The trail began climbing almost immediately and wound its way up the side of the mountain, ducking in between a flanking ridge and the mountain and following the small valley which had formed between them up. The route involved a bit of climbing as the topsoil became thinner the higher I climbed. 
Every so often I came across a small dark hole in the ground which was lined with rock. It seems that the entire surface that I was walking on was actually a thin dirt layer held together by roots and covering a giant boulder field. In some places the boulders protruded and I climbed over them, and in others the thin facade was broken by these small caves, from some of which eminated the sound of water flowing in the rocky subterrainian. 
I came to the my first view of the day and admired the scene spread out before me, a small alpine pond nestled into a bowl carved out of the mountain in front and below me, just beyond it a high peak, to my right the ski runs of sugarloaf and all the mountains I had climbed yesterday, and to my left flagstaff lake covering an immense area. I climbed down and walked around the lake, coming to the lean-to. On my way in to check it out I met two thru hikers who introduced themselves as ""Lady"" (which I thought was a wierd trail name at first) and ""The Tramp"" (ooooh.... now it makes sense). They were NOBOs turned flip floppers when they realized they weren't going to make it to Katahdin in time for the winter and we traded some info on the trail ahead. 
This lean-to was actually two lean-tos, presumably to handle the increased traffic through this popular site, and I passed a caretaker's tent as I headed up the mountain (note that, while this site has a caretaker like some of the AMC sites, MATC doesn't charge a fee to stay here, which is nice). The ascent was steep but short and soon I was standing on the southern peak taking in the view and looking ahead to the western peak and little bigelow ahead of me. 
As I hiked over these peaks I passed a couple of additional french youth groups... apparently this is a popular destination. I had a lunch on Avery Peak (named for one of the men primarily responsible for the creation of the AT) again taking some time to admire the scenery. For the past couple years I've done some XC-skiing in the area and I could pick out the small airport that we started at and some of the landmarks that we passed on our way between the huts that we had slept in. 
The descent down from the Bigelows was also steep and not a ton of fun as I knew that I'd have to regain some of the altitude for Little Bigelow but the climb up Little Bigelow was actually pretty gradual and not too bad. I passed another group of day hikers from the AT conference and once again took in the sights from a viewpoint at the end of the range, looking back at all the peaks I had climbed today. 
I had about 4mi to cover and about 2hr to do it in, which should've been no problem, however my superpower seems to be finding berries whenever I have somewhere to be and today was no exception. I tried to limit myself to only grabbing berries while on the move but that proved ineffective in a number of cases where I found a bush just too full to pass up. 
Finally I had no choice and pressed on, cruising down the mountain and following the winding path worn into the lichen from rocky island to island. I came to Little Bigelow Lean-to and, noticing that I had a bit of extra time, threw myself into one of ""the tubs"", rocky basins that the stream flowed through, to try to get rid of some of the hiker smell before I got in a confined space with my uncle. The trail down to the road was wonderful, dirt and gently sloping, and in no time I was down at the road where my uncle and a car awaited.
I'm not going to describe the full visit here, but I got to use their outdoor shower (which actually had hot water), had a great steak dinner with my uncle and aunt, and had blueberry ice cream with blueberry cake for dessert. 
All and all, a great day. I feel inclined to point out that combining yesterday's and todays 9600ft and 6000ft of elevation gain brings my two day total to well over half an everest in the past 50mi of trail. On the upside, I don't have to climb any mountains tomorrow and get to hike past a couple of ponds... sounds like a nice break from the mountains.","Cranberry stream campsite
",East Flagstaff Rd,"Aug 07, Mon",14.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575191,"Unsurprisingly I was the first one up in the household so I just hung out for a while and chilled in bed, a relaxing start to the morning. We had eggs, sausage, blueberry bread, and english muffins for breakfast and then hit the road. We stopped at a small lakeside convenience store (which also had a dock so that boats from 2 different lakes could park) and I grabbed a box of granola bars for snacking and a couple of apple turnovers for breakfast on the trail. After that we were off, retracing our steps from yesterday on the hour and a half drive back to the trail.
I got back to the trail just after 10am and after saying goodbye to my uncle I was back on the trail, right where I had left off. The trail this morning started out pretty flat and followed the shore of flagstaff lake for a couple of miles. Of course the boardwalks over the muddy sections were wet and slippery and of course I ate it right in front of a dad and son hiking, but other than that the hike was pleasant. I passed the campsite I had picked out before I had made plans with my uncle and it was indeed a very nice site, right next to the lake and a couple of sandy beaches, but I think my accomodations last night ended up being a bit better.
I got my one hill of the day out of the way early, though I hesitate to even call it a hill it was so gradual. I passed a SOBO who said that from hear on out the hiking should be pretty easy, a welcome bit of advice, and I crossed Long Falls Dam Rd and another two 2000 mile markers. Back into the woods the trail varied between nice pine-needle covered dirt and a mixture of roots and mud, but either way it wasn't a hill or mountain so I wasn't complaining.
I had lunch at the West Carry Pond Lean-to, running into another ATC conference group and getting a handful of peanut M&Ms and a small bag of homemade cookies as TRAIL MAGIC. I sat and enjoyed looking out over the water for a few minutes, human civilization only visible in two or three places along the pond shore where a camp had been built. 
The next couple of miles were similar to the last with a couple of sections of really nice trail along the way, again leading to another pond. Here at East Carry Pond I found Pie and Otto splayed out on a small sandy beach, Pie half floating on his air matress and enjoying a nap on the shore of the lake. Being a little after noon, by this time I had realized that there was no way I could make the next 10mi before 2pm to catch the last ferry for day across the Kennebeck river, so there was no way that this was turning into a long day. In addition, the afternoon was beautiful, a few puffy clouds floating through the sky, the lake was peaceful, and only a light breeze disturbing its surface, so I took my shoes off and set my feet in the water to soak and enjoyed the sun.
I think I hung out there for about two hours... we built up a little crowd throughout the afternoon as other hikers came upon us and decided that they had time to take a break at this idealic spot. Only a couple made it past us without stopping and we had a great afternoon on the lake. Eventually, at around 4pm I decided that I should probably get moving and put my shoes back on and started walking, but I didn't make it far before running into a ton of blueberries on the trail around the lake and it took me a while to escape their clutches.
The trail to camp was pretty easy, but as usual this close to the end of the day, felt longer than the numerical milage would indicate. I finally came to a blue blazed trail to the west which headed towards a lake, and sure enough the shiny metal roof of the shelter was just visible over the rocky ledge. I headed down there to find the shelter already mostly full with a group of 4 older hikers doing a section, and though they offered I didn't join them, opting to tent tonight. 
There wasn't much flat ground to choose from, but I managed to find a mostly flat and rock/root free spot a ways down the shore and setup there, just a few feet from the water. After filtering my water for the night, cleaning myself up, and unpacking I headed back to the shelter to hang out with the other hikers. Not long after I got there an obviously non-thru hiker stopped in, carrying only a portable cooler. Could it be??? TRAIL MAGIC. The hiker, Wes, offered a selection of beer, an IPA, IPA, or an IPA, which just so happened to be my new favorite type of beer tonight.
Wes hung out and talked for a while and packed out most of the trash from his magic, except for mine because I was saving mine to have with dinner, which I was in the process of cooking. I ate and then headed down to Harrison's, just 0.3mi down a blue blaze. Harrison's is a privately owned hunting camp which offered a place to stay and/or breakfast in the morning. I signed up for breakfast the next morning and then headed back to camp by way of the waterfall next to Harrisons and ran into a ton of blueberries there that I stopped to eat.
By the time I got back to camp the sun was setting over the lake and after watching the spectacle we all drifted back to our shelters and off to sleep to the sound of a loon calling across the lake.","East Flagstaff Rd
",Pierce Pond Lean-to,"Aug 08, Tue",16.30
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578101,"I woke up at 6 and got up and started packing. AWOL and the sign on the shelter both said that Harrison served breakfast at 7am sharp, and I didn't intend to be late. I got everything packed up and thrown into my bag (I was still wearing camp clothes and so would need to reorganize later anyways) and headed over to the hunting camp. 
There, amidst the wonderful smell of sausage frying, I found Mr Harrison himself, a one man show in the kitchen, cooking eggs, preparing sausage, and making pancakes. Promptly at 7 he brought the food out, a huge pile of 12 pancakes per person along with eggs and sausage, which I dug into. These pancakes were by far the best I've had on trail... he called them patriotic pancakes which were filled with cinnamon apples, raspberries, and blueberries and topped with real maple syrup. I could barely finish all of mine, but I managed it, stuffed to the point of not wanting to move. 
A SOBO, Admiral, showed up 20min late and without cash (he only had a credit card) and asked if he could eat but quickly retreated when he was told that they obviously couldn't take credit cards here. I finished up, changed into my hiking attire, and packed up and headed out over the rickety packing pallet bridge that spanned the river where I found admiral eating his breakfast. He said he felt like he had gotten a wierd vibe there and I agreed. Privately, I thought it was obvious that the source of the vibe was the fact that he had shown up without money to a breakfast with posted prices and had arrived 20min late when they made an effort to say that breakfast was at 7am sharp, but I didn't feel like explaining and moved on.
The trail followed the outflow from the lake gradually downwards as it wore its way into the rocky landscape, forming a gorge. I passed multiple waterfalls and crossed several tributaries over the next 3mi down to the Kennebeck river. There I found everyone from my camp last night waiting on the shore of the river for the ferry to start at 9am. The only official way to cross the Kennebeck river (according to the ATC) is to use the ferry service they provide, which is necessary because the river is dammed both upstream and downstream of the crossing which means the water level often and unpredictably changes drastically, making fording the river dangerous. 
On the other bank I could see a man deploy a canoe into the river and start rowing over and it wasn't long until he was heading back with the first two hikers from this side of the river while his son was working through having the rest of us sign the release form. I was on the 4th trip of the day across the river and I got the front seat and therefore a paddle. The guide called me out on having canoed before and we discussed the Alagash river, a several hundred mile long river in northern maine, that we had both canoed before.
Safely on the other shore, I chatted for a few minutes with another group from the ATC conference, who were gradually making their way across the river via the canoe, about how the trip had been thus far and why I was out hiking. As their group size dwindled I moved on, walking along the river for a short distance before emerging from the woods onto a road. I crossed and, instead of following the trail, headed 0.1mi down the road to Caratunk House B&B, which I had been eagerly awaiting for the past couple days. There I got a milkshake, made in a real milkshake blender (like the kind you see at diners), though I opted to skip the pulled pork sandwich (which I heard was amazing) since I was still full from breakfast this morning. I hung out for a bit, journaled, and recharged my battery while I enjoyed my shake. Looking through the log, I saw that both Lost and Lookout had been through here only a day or two ahead of me... so close to catching them!
Pie and Otto showed up a little bit later and were planning on heading down into town to find the place with the hot tub, which sounded like a wonderful adventure, but I was so close to catching Lost and I had been hearing about the amazing blueberries atop the next two mountains for days and it was time to see what all the fuss was about. I hit the trail and headed gradually uphill, crossing several roads, and running into another ATC group coming down from Pleasant Pond Mt. Up on top of the mountain I did indeed find a multitude of blueberries, and stopped to pick for a while, leapfrogging a couple other hikers as we alternating picking and hiking-and-wishing-we-were-picking until we had to stop. Needless to say those were not very fast miles as I crossed over the rocky top of the mountain and then followed the winding moss-lined paths across the rocky ridge.
Perhaps because of the dallying in picking berries, the miles seemed to stretch on and it felt like it took forever to get down off the mountain. I took a short break down by a pond and had a kitkat before heading up my last mountain for the day, Moxie bald. As opposed to the balds earlier in the hike, this one didn't have a soft grassy meadow at the peak but instead had large rocky slabs that the trail was forced to take a very circuitous route to ascend, but in between and on top of almost every rock slab grew blueberry bushes weighed down with multitudes of berries. The sun was starting to head for the horizon, but even so I spent significant time up there just eating, taking a couple steps every couple minutes to get to a blue-er area to graze. I was joined by another two hikers who also stopped to eat and we all eventually pulled ourselves away as the sun actually started to set. 
The descent down the mountain to camp was pretty quick and even more berries lined the trail on the way down. Home tonight is right on the edge of Moxie bald pond... there were some guys smoking in the shelter and so I was perfectly happy opting for a campsite right next to the lake. I set my tent up in the deepening shadows and brought my food and cook-kit out onto some shore-side rocks where I washed today's filth off and then enjoyed my dinner as the pinks and purples faded from the surrounding hills. I retired to my tent but it wasn't long before the loons started conversing, generating quite the racket as one called out and a symphony of voices responded.
I'm only 19mi from Monson, so I'm going to try to get an early start and get there quick enough that I can spend the afternoon resupplying and relaxing before heading into the 100mi wilderness tomorrow with Lost.","Pierce Pond Lean-to

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578100,"I was up and on the trail before the sun this morning, taking my first steps just as the sun crested some low hills on the opposite side of the pond. Today was the day that I'd get to Monson, last town on the trail, and when I'd catch up to Lost. I cruised this morning, knocking off miles while listening to a couple podcasts but eventually just settling into listening to the sounds of nature. The morning had a number of water crossings, some with small bridges to span the stream, some with a loosely organized line of rocks which could be hopped, and some with no assistance save a rope strung across the stream to assist with balance. These tended to be larger rivers and for both branches of the Piscataquis river I removed my shoes, put on my flip flops, and crossed using the support of my trekking poles (the rope was a nice thought, and is probably useful for people without poles, but I found the poles to be a lot more stable). I passed a pond, traveled along some quiet woods roads, and otherwise enjoyed the trail, though I was still anxious to get to Monson as soon as I could this morning to give myself as much of a zero as I could get (at least having the afternoon off). Towards the end I threw on some music and soon enough arrived at the road and called for my shuttle.
Poet, owner of Shaw's hostel, arrived in just a couple minutes and we chatted on the way into town. As soon as I stepped inside he handed me a complementary beer and showed me around and I immediately availed myself of a hot shower. After finishing my beer I headed into town and got some lunch and a beer and the lakeside restaurant and texted Lost, asking if she wanted to join me. I finished up my meal, and not having heard from lost, walked around upstairs (in the hostel she said she was staying at) looking for her, but saw no sign of her. I made my way around town and picked up food for my resupply and spent most of the afternoon at the hostel, lounging and napping until I got hungry for dinner. I headed back down to the Lakeside restaurant, having enjoyed the steak and cheese I had for lunch, and again headed upstairs to look for Lost. Again no luck, but this time I asked around and was eventually directed to a small bunkroom where I found, vegged on her bed, LOST!! 
It turns out that, having AT&T, she has no service in Monson and so hadn't gotten my text earlier in the day, and had been chilling up here pretty much the whole time. We hung out on the couch for a bit with another hiker (who shared a couple of his beers with us) and watched the news (which happened to be on the TV) for about a minute before deciding that we wanted nothing to do with it. We headed downstairs to participate in the evening festivities... Lost had said there was karaoke tonight which sounded fun, but it turned out to be an open mic night (which is not the same as karaoke). The music was entertaining and we sat with a group of other hikers, SOBOs who had done the 100mi about 2 months ago and then had to get off trail, but were back to do some more.
All and all, a good night. While I've loved hiking solo and getting to move at my own pace and push myself for the past couple days, it is really good to have caught up with Lost. Tomorrow we head into the 100mi wilderness. She's going to get a head start while I hang back, get a couple last pieces of food, and mail a box of stuff home for her (so that she doesn't have to wait for the post office to open at 9), but I'll catch up to her before tomorrow night. 100mi wilderness, the final stretch, here we come!","Moxie Bald Lean-to
",Shaw's Hostel,"Aug 10, Thu",17.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578099,"The morning started off with the huge breakfast that Shaw's is trail-famous for: eggs, sausage, pancakes, orange juice... so good. After breakfast and getting packed up I headed outside. The weather was pretty gray and it had been showering on and off throughout the morning. Of course, the showers were on when I walked down to the post office. I put Lost's package in the mail, stopped by the store to pick up a couple more snacks and then headed back to Shaws. I was able to get a ride back to the trail with a couple of other hikers in just a couple minutes and soon enough we were back on the side of the road.
Just down the trail, out of sight of the road, was the sign. The ""there's nothing for 100miles so you had better have 10days of food with you"" sign. I obviously didn't have 10 days of food... I had 5ish, but that would be plenty. I grabbed a picture with the sign and then headed into the ""Wilderness"". Sidenote, its kinda amusing that the 100mi wilderness isn't actually a wilderness. A wilderness is a technical designation which applies to a piece of land in which motorized vehicles and tools are prohibited. The 100mi has several roads which cross through it and plenty of logging which happens near/in it, so it doesn't fit the bill. I'm still hopeful that it will be pretty remote. We'll see!
Anyways, I headed into the wilderness and walked around several larger ponds which reflected the gray sky above. The terrain was challenging, not so much in terms of elevation, mostly in its unevenness and rocky and wet everything was. The trail climbed up and over a number of rocky outcrops which criss-crossed the landscape and with my shoes as well-worn as they were, I didn't have much traction left on the slippery faces and ended up on my back a couple of times. The slick terrain made the going slow and it took a couple hours to make the couple miles to the first shelter.
I had lunch at Leeman Brook Lean-to, a little dismayed that it was already noon and that I had only done 3 miles so far. Lost had started at 7am, so I had a ways to go to catch her (again) and finish the 19mi that we had planned for today. While I ate 2 guys passed by SOBO, happy to be almost out of the 100mi wilderness and alerting me to trail magic about 12mi up ahead. That was all the motivation I needed and I hit the trail again, trying to move as fast and safely as possible. The trail wound around pond after pond, the water still and gray with the exception of the thousands of tiny drops falling into them. 
I passed a large waterfall and was amazed to see the rocks surrounding it. Geologists make, what they call, the assumption of original horizontality, which means that rocks are generally formed in horizontal layers whether by sediment deposition or other processes. So when you see a rock whose layers are something other than horizontal you know that something has caused them to bend/twist into that new orientation in the intervening years since their formation. Well, the layers in these rocks were oriented vertically. The long and tumultuous history of the Appalachian mountains had ended up turning these rocks a full 90deg, presumably as the mountains were compressed and uplifted. This waterfall had exposed some of the rock as it slowly cut its way through. Kinda cool. This also explains the terrain... the multitude of small ups and downs over rocky outcrops are what's left of these tilted layers of rocks, outlasting the softer surrounding rocks and jutting up into the sky and then being eroded away back to ground level.
Though the guide had shown no large mountains today, I was surprised at how rugged the terrain was as it seemed like I was either going up or down all day, which adds up. I kept hearing reports of the trail magic from the hikers I passed as I drew closer. Finally I got to the intersection of... well, it might be generous calling it a road, but a dirt path that could probably hold a truck, and found Lost! She was holding a beer and in the process of scratching ""Crusher"" and an arrow into the dirt right in front of the sign for trail magic. We set off down the road, heading the 0.2mi to the hunting cabin that housed the magic. I asked her what was going on up there and she related tales of the burgers and hotdogs, the coolers of beer, and the small grassy area in front of the cabin. It only took a ""so they let people camp there?"" ... ""yup!"" to set our plans for the night... 17mi was close enough to the 19 we had planned, we were done for the day. 
The cabin was situated on a small hill and the ""driveway"" had a view of Barren mountain, which we'd hike tomorrow. A small generator provided enough electricity to run some lights and keep some water running and a small privy was set off into the woods. Already there was a good group of hikers at the cabin, some of whom seemed to have been there for a while based on the amount of alcohol consumed. The guys who provided this magic, Scout and Birdman, also had a yellow lab that would bark at new arrivals a couple of times before deciding that they weren't a threat and going back to lazing around. After introducing myself I was handed a burger, a dog, and a beer and settled into hanging out with the others.
A group of NOBOs, Monkey, Silly Spilly, Pluck, Pudge, had also decided that they weren't going any farther than night and so we all hung out for the evening. Jam showed up as well as a couple of SOBOs, and they guys played cards while Birdman took the girls raspberry picking so that there'd be fresh berries for the pancakes in the morning. I really wanted to go, but there wasn't room in the gator, so alas I had to keep drinking and playing cards. We spent the whole night hanging out and drinking with good company, laughter echoing into the forest around the cabin.Not too long after dark we all started loosing steam and began scouting sleeping spots for the night. Lost had sent her hammock home (in the box I had mailed earlier that morning), since she had been sleeping in the shelters for the past couple weeks and needed to loose some pack weight to save her knees. So that left her shelter-less in a place that had no shelter. Turns out my tent is actually a 2 person tent as long as neither of the occupants has much of a personal bubble. 
Good day. Very much enjoying the ""wilderness"" so far. :)","Shaw's Hostel
",Long Pond Tote Rd,"Aug 11, Fri",14.20
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578098,"The morning started early as usual. It had rained overnight and so everything was wet but we relocated to the cabin's porch while we all woke up. Inside the smell of pancakes wafted out and soon Birdman plopped a large pile of pancakes and some real maple syrup down in front of us. We dug in and in no time the pile had been reduced to nothing. The raspberries that the girls had picked last night we a wonderful addition to the breakfast and we were all reluctant to move afterwards. 
Last night Birdman had been explaining that the road that ran in front of the cabin connected to another road which rejoined the trail in about 15min having bypassed the next series of mountains. Lost had been planning to road walk today to reduce the burden on her knees, but during breakfast Birdman generously offered to slack pack all of us up to the point where the trail crossed the road again. Everyone jump on the opportunity and I opted to not carry the majority of my food, keeping only a day's worth with me and packing the rest up into the back of the truck to reduce my load. Most everyone else emptied their packs, carrying only a bit of food, water (and beer), and a rain jacket, but I opted for the compromise. 
Lost decided to stay behind and help move the bags, agreeing to meet up at the pack drop point at the end of today and the rest of us headed out. We moved along, our packs light and spirits high from the magic we had been fortunate enough to receive. We chatted throughout the morning, the weather still gray as we ascended a mountain up into the clouds, the landscape disappearing below us. The mountains up here seemed steeper and the climb up to the top was short but steep. We took a short break up at an abandoned fire tower, marked only by the large metal supports protruding from the rock, its platform having been removed/destroyed. We only rested briefly because we quickly cooled down in the moderate breeze. 
The trail wound up and down, through another bog, over a series of treacherously slick rocky faces, and I let the others pull a bit ahead to enjoy the peace, solitude, and blueberries. I caught them not long after at a waterfall which crossed the trail and we took lunch there. I pulled ahead after lunch, meeting a couple hikers from a nearby AMC hut who were out exploring the numerous trails in the area and had wanted to come up to the AT so that the could say they hiked it (though they planned to omit how much of it they hiked). We chatted about my hike and they ended up gifting me the cookies from the lunch that the had gotten from the hut, a welcome treat on this rather dreary day. 
The afternoon stretched out, mile after mile, the main excitement coming from a steep scramble down from a rocky ridge, hopping from boulder to boulder, slick with mist and rain, and doing my best to not eat-it in a manner which would severely injure myself. The rocky ledges that the trail followed offered views of the expansive wilderness from amongst the scraggly pines which adorned the crest. For as far as the eye could see (which granted wasn't as far as normal given the weather) the forest stretched on over the undulating ridges, the depressions gouged by the titantic glaciers as they had retreated after the last ice age. Not a road, town, or structure in sight the land felt wild. A good feeling.
As the trail wound down off the ridge I started running into the occasional hiker, growing more frequent. A good or bad sign, depending on how you look at it. On one hand, it meant I was coming up to the road which meant only a couple more miles for the day. On the other, it meant I was going to have to pick up my food and carry it those last couple miles. In the distance I started hearing the low rumble of trucks (probably logging trucks) and soon enough I crossed a wide gravel road and continued down to the river. The trail followed the river for a bit before forking. I headed right, back to the road to retrieve my food, which had been hidden behind a log a ways into the woods, as agreed. Lost, was nowhere to be found though. Atop my pack I found a small note... ""Decided to stay at the cabin another night, will meet up tomorrow. I found fudge! - Lost"". 
I was not terribly pleased as I repacked my food... Lost was enjoying another night at the cabin, drinking beer and eating burgers, had somehow apparently found fudge, while I was stuck lugging this extra ~7lbs of food another couple miles to a shelter. I trudged back to the river, switched into my sandals, forded, and swapped back and continued on, eager to get away from the crowds. Cars had lined the road and there were a multitude of people on this section of trail. The next 2mi of trail were well groomed... flat and with most of the rocks having been removed for the benefit of the day hikers who wandered this path up to the ""Grand Canyon of Maine"". 
The AT eventually branched off back into the woods, returning to its normal rocky, uneven, self after that brief interlude. To further the contrast, the next section of trail had an unusually high number of blow downs, which slowed the last couple miles. By this time I was pretty ready to be done for the day and every upcoming flat section filled me with hope that I had finally found camp, only to be disappointed. Along the way I ran into Tropical and Sgt, who SOBOs-gone-NOBO that I had met in the Smokies and we chatted for a bit before heading our separate ways. After crossing another bog the trail started following a stream uphill and finally reached camp. 
The shelter was located on the side of a hill and only had a few spots flat enough to support a tent, so I grabbed a spot in the shelter. From there I ran through my routine... filtering water, changing clothes and relaxing as evening began to overtake the shelter. Two section hikers, friends from the crew team at college, Sean and ????, had been at the shelter when I arrived and made dinner as well, lamenting their sore and blistered feet. 
As I unpacked my food back for dinner I came across a large chuck of fudge, wrapped in wax paper. I certainly hadn't packed it, but Lost's note put me in a better mood now... not a taunt about her good fortune but a bit of magic. I savored the chocolate fudge after my dinner, its richness a perfect dessert after a long day of hiking. 
I didn't last much longer after dinner... Monkey joined me at the shelter tonight, the only one of the crew to make it, the rest having stopped somewhere back a couple miles probably. Tomorrow I've got a mountain or two... neither should be too bad, and then the terrain gets pretty flat for the rest of the way.","Trail Magic Camp / Long Pond Tote Rd
",Carl Newhall Lean-to,"Aug 12, Sat",21.70
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578097,"This morning I hit the trail early, getting moving while the other guys ate breakfast or continued to snooze. Before I left though, I got to watch one of the section hikers attempt to dry out his underwear. With his cookstove. It was all going really well... he was holding them over the stove with a stick and there was steam coming off them as the water evaporated until he decided they were dry enough and turned them over. In the crotch was a huge melted hole, the edges still steaming. He disappeared behind the shelter and came back with hiking shorts on, declaring the underwear to be still functional, but that my friends, is why you just accept the wet underwear and get hiking. Which I did.
I crossed another bog and then the trail turned uphill to cross a series of hills which constituted the only real elevation for the day. The morning was sunny and the air had a pleasant chill to it as I headed uphill, though the shirt still came off almost immediately to reduce the sweating.  I stopped and filled up on water at the tiny spring at Sidney Tappan Campsite, grabbing enough to last for the next couple miles of mountains. The trail was pleasant and I passed a couple other hikers during the morning as I made my way over the mountains. Finally I topped out on White Cap mountain and stopped and had a snack of summer sausage, cheese, and crackers while I took in the view. Some low clouds, below me, drifted over the landscape and I could see them dumping some rain just to the west of me... weather that would probably be coming my way. Supposedly there was supposed to be a view of Katahdin from here but it was hard to tell... there was a hulking shape in the distance, blanketed in clouds, which I supposed could've been the mountain, but alas my augmented reality mountain identifying app wouldn't show me mountains that far away (and didn't work particularly well anyways) so I couldn't confirm. 
I headed down the mountain, stopping again at a rocky overlook which stretched out away from the side of the mountain and poked out through the tall evergreen trees which densely packed the slopes. From there, now about eye level with me, I could definitely see some clouds, rain pouring out of their undersides, heading towards me. I took the downhill as quickly as possible given the switchbacks which wound through a lovely stand of birch trees, their white bark and emerald green leaves giving the forest a vibrant and cheerful quality despite the impending storm. The first rumble of thunder rolled past me just a little ways from the shelter and I resigned myself to getting wet... in typically hiking fashion, some unreasonably short distance away from cover. But this time luck was with me and I stepped into Logan-brook Lean-to JUST as the rain started coming down, quickly intensifying to a downpour. 
I didn't have anywhere in particular to be, so I set my bag down, pulled out my lunch, and sat inside and watched the water stream down off the roof and listened to the large rain drops make a consistent drum-roll on the metal roof. I caught up on the shelter log, seeing Lookout having come through here a couple days earlier, as well as a couple other familiar names, but enjoyed my half hour break as the storm passed. About halfway through a couple other hikers that I had seen earlier in the morning joined me, having not been so lucky in their timing of the storm, and we all waited it out. As the last rumbles of thunder were fading into the distance behind us the sun came back out and starting doing work to dry everything out. 
As I left the site I noticed two things... some SOBOs had told us that this shelter was COVERED in moose droppings and that we definitely shouldn't stay here, which it wasn't. And that the sun only dried off the plants on the half of the trail it was facing, meaning my right side was soaked while my left side was pretty much dry. The trail down off the mountain descended quickly but was great trail and so I moved quickly. After crossing a gravel road I walked through another forest rockfield, the rocks only visible in a couple of places where the moss and trees hadn't completely covered them yet, and heard some logging going on in the distance. In a couple of spots I found some small blueberry bushes, mainly growing in small sunny gaps between the trees, and soon came upon the next shelter. I didn't stop here, just popping in to check the shelter log, and noticed that Lost hadn't signed, which meant that she was definitely still behind me. It being 2pm and the next shelter only 8mi away I headed out, crossing over Pleasant river and heading back into the woods.
The trail headed up over Little Boardman Mt, little being the operative word, as it was only a 400ft climb and hardly seemed to deserve being called a mountain. I did get a bit of cell service at the top and was able to confirm that I'd have a ride back from Katahdin from TopBunk, which was helpful. Down the mountain, across a road, and to a beautiful sandy beach on the edge of a small lake and I was down. Sitting on the sand in the warm sun, looking out over the small waves which the light breeze kicked up on the water, and chatting with a SOBO who had decided that this was as far as he was going today... can't get much better. As we sat there a couple more SOBOs showed up, include Rowdy, who I had last seen in Franklin, NC, and her dog Steve. She had made it to Pearisburg, VA, got caught in a vortex for a while, realized she wasn't going to make it, and had flipped north, a NOBO-gone-SOBO flip flopper. 
Anyways, after the better part of an hour sitting at the beach I decided that I had better get moving and so reluctantly shouldered my pack and headed out... this really would've been a nice place to camp with the sound of the waves gently lapping on the shore. I followed the trail most of the way around the lake and then followed the lake's outflow off into the woods. I also had the realization that I REALLY should've signed the log at the last shelter... I had assumed that it would be obvious to Lost that I was heading for the next shelter, based on the mileage, terrain, and shelter spacing, but in hindsight I realized that that wasn't terribly obvious at all. Whoops...
The trail for the next 10mi was a gradual downhill and so wasn't difficult and I was moving along well. About 2mi from the shelter I caught a short glimpse of something on the trail ahead of me... definitely 4 legged, about the size of a larger dog, but which bounded off into the woods with superb grace and presumably scampered off, because I saw no more trace of it. I have no idea what it was... its grace and speed seemed feline, but that would be a BIG cat... like, mountain lion big... mountain lions aren't common up here but I had no desire to stick around and confirm a sighting either way, so I double-timed it to camp, every so often glancing behind me to make sure nothing was following me... not that I would've probably been able to pick out as stealthy and skilled a hunter as a mountain lion. 
I made it safely and found a small, mostly flat patch of ground to setup my tent on since most of the other spots had already been taken. I guess it must be a weekend because there are definitely more people out than usual, but my little space suited me fine and I brought my cook stuff out onto the rocks in front of the shelter to eat. The shelter sat up on a small rocky outcrop and just in front of it a river flowed past, forming a large pool right in front of the shelter and with tumbling cascades of water both upstream and downstream. I washed off, filtered water, and cooked dinner as everyone conversed about our respective hikes. 
And then guess who rolled into camp... Lost! And she brought wine! Five liters of wine! Holy crap! She had found a ride into and back out of town and an angel bought the wine for her to share with everyone at camp that night. TRAIL MAGIC. IN THE ""WILDERNESS""! The wine made dinner a lot more lively as 5L of wine is still a fair amount for the 10 or so people that were hanging around the shelter at the time. We all filled our cook pots with wine, the only cups available to us (and the epitome of trail classiness) and enjoyed our dinners and some extended conversation that lasted until a little after sundown. Lost had also brought more fudge with her, maple flavored this time, and between the wine and the fudge, I definitely couldn't hold a grudge for her ditching me for the past two days. But we agreed that next time I had to carry the wine.
Tomorrow we head to White house landing, which is apparently a hunt/fishing camp set on a lake that will come and get hikers from the trail via boat if you call. They have a bunkhouse and amazing food from what we've heard, so should be a good time. We're only 14mi away and we gain a total of 140ft of elevation tomorrow, so should be a pretty easy day.","Carl Newhall Lean-to

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578095,"We had a great breakfast this morning. The owners of the landing served coffee while the hikers lounged on the front porch in the morning sun, chatting and lounging before we began our hikes for the day. We managed not to rush the dining room but quickly took our seats as breakfast was served, enjoying the eggs from the owner's hens, bacon, and all-we-could-eat blueberry pancakes. The 8 of us went through two and a half trays of pancakes before finally running out of steam. We checked out, packed the last pieces of our gear, and then headed down to the dock to wait. 
Overhead the sun shone, dissipating the refreshing morning chill which hung in the air. The waves lapped gently on the dock as we waited and soon enough the low drone of the motorboat could be heard, finally emerging from down a deep cove. Lost, Snap, and I hopped on the boat and I scored the bow seat as we skimmed over the water. Must be pretty nice for the owners... live on a lake, get to take a couple boat rides a day to get hikers... not a bad existence.
Soon enough though we arrived back at the small dock that marked the trail back to the AT and watched the boat head back to pick up the next batch of hikers. After changing from our sandals into our hiking shoes we hit the trail, retracing our steps from the day before back to the trail. The trail followed one of the lake's tributaries, dipping down to its banks in places and slightly into the woods in others. At points the river widened almost into a pond and we kept an eye out for Moose or other wildlife which might be enjoying this morning at their pond as well. Disappointingly we didn't end up seeing any wildlife, though that probably wasn't helped any by turning on Lost's pump-up playlist as we ascended a steep bank/hill neighboring one of the ponds. In queuing up our morning entertainment Lost accidentally merged her pump-up and sad country playlists which yielded an interesting music mix for the morning, alternating between motivational and thought-provoking themes.
We had heard that there was a great beach on one of the lakes that we'd pass about 7mi into the day and soon enough we crossed over small dirt road, passed some small campsites, and emerged onto a sandy beach which looked down the length of Nahmakanta lake. The beach encircled the lake, narrowing in places, and we almost opted to follow it around the lake (which we knew the trail circumnavigated) except for a small portion of the coast along which it turned into a large boulder field. Even though we ever following the lake shore, the trail crossed up and down the steep hills which bordered the lake before we finally descended back to its shores and to our goal. Just off to the right a small spring filled a hole in the ground and following its outflow we emerged onto a beach. We walked the beach for a couple hundred feet before finding a small hideout complete with folding chairs, a straw hat, and a carpet. 
Packs down... feet up... ahhhhh. It didn't take long for us to end up in the water, swimming around the shallow sandy beach, trading glances with a couple of loons who swam farther out, diving occasionally into the deep. Lost's loon calls didn't seem to strike their fancy and they eventually moved on as we got out some lunch and lounged. I enjoyed the leftover pizza I had packed out of White House in my beach chair, the sole visitors to this peaceful lake save one small rowboat aways down. 
Monkey, Tiptoe, Silly Spilly, Pluck showed up in the early afternoon, having camped just a couple miles before White House at another lake-side beach that we had passed yesterday, and they joined in the lounging. Lost and Pluck blew up their air mattresses and floated around for a bit on the lake as Monkey collected a number of the freshwater muscles that grew in the lake and started cooking them into some ramen for lunch. 
It would've been super nice to camp here for the night, but alas, we were only ~20mi from Abol bridge and both Lost and I had people to meet there tomorrow, so mid-afternoon we reluctantly packed up and headed out. The next mountain kicked our butts as we dragged ourselves and our packs up it in the heat of the day, quickly drawing a sweat. So much for there only being one mountain left...
The view at the top made up for it and I waited at the overlook for a few minutes, admiring the sunlight shining off the water of the lake I had just swam in below, and Katahdin rising imposingly in the distance. The fully breath of the mountain was now visible, the deep green of the forests slowly giving way to the gray rock of the table-lands and summit and gray streaks down its sides marked rock slides which had cleared the forest from its flanks. The mountain seemed to stretch on, transforming into peak after peak as it faded off into the distance.
The descent from the peak was much easier than the ascent and we kept most of the elevation that we had gained. Not long after the trail came to another pond, this one sitting in a bowl carved out of the rock which surrounded it. I found one of the best blueberry patches I've ever come across along the banks of the lake and stopped to feast, enjoying the large tart berries, my favorite type. As I picked, not 20ft off the trail, I watched a large group of day hikers trundle past me, completely unaware of my presence despite my proximity. It wasn't until I happened to snap a branch while picking that one finally noticed me, giving a yelp as she mistook me for a bear momentarily. Lol.
The outlet of the pond had carved a deep gorge in the rock and the trail slowly descended to its banks as the gorge widened. The trail crossed on a logging road which bridged the river and we dove back into the forest once more. Not long after the trail met up with another river (presumably rainbow stream) and followed it until finally coming to the shelter. A large log protruded from the ground just outside the shelter and had been carved into a huge (somewhat creepy) tiki/totem

Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578094,"This morning I ended up rolling over to my first two alarms before finally being roused by the third. It was cold out there and warm in my quilt and I really didn't feel like moving.
I ended up getting all packed up and rolling by 530, 30min later than I had wanted, but I still hit the trail before anyone else in camp had moved. I ate a poptart on the trail as breakfast and kept rolling. My goal for the morning was to make it to Abol bridge as fast as humanly possible to sign up for one of the twelve spots at The Birches for tonight in Baxter. I knew there were a fair number of thru hikers ahead of me, but it was really going to suck if I had to walk 10mi into the park and summit on the same day, hence the early start today. 
I passed a pond, misty and with the ghostly echo of a loon's call still hanging in the air above the water, in the pre-dawn light and kept blazing on. The trail, though mostly flat, was not easy and mud, roots, and rocks made it feel like I wasn't moving nearly fast enough for the amount of effort I was putting in.
Finally the trail broke away from the pond and back up into the woods and the trail smoothed out a bit more. I didn't bother to head up to an overlook of Katahdin since the gray clouds overhead would more than likely be obscuring the mountain and kept moving, coming up to Rainbow Lake campground. I chatted with Jailbird there for a couple minutes amidst the multitude of tents setup in the surrounding area... most of their occupants yet to rise. I was glad of the decision to stay at the lean-to last night... Jailbird said that he had barely gotten here last night before the rain started and I think we had a much better time eating and singing along to Lost's playlist in the shelter than we would've otherwise. 
I didn't stay for long, and back on the trail I soon ran into (and passed) Jam who had just left camp. The trail followed the lake for the next couple miles, dipping down to the shore and then back up into the woods, adding a surprising amount of elevation for a flat section of trail. The roots, rocks, and mud came and went as I continued and soon enough the trail headed up and away from the lake for the last time and started climbing up into rockier terrain.
Though the sun had started to shine down on me as I hiked, the clouds had not yet cleared enough for a view of Katahdin from Rainbow Ledges and so I didn't linger there. It was painful, but I kept myself to only having a few blueberries up there, not wanting to get caught for too long and fall behind. I had been passing hikers sporadically throughout the morning and each one meant a better chance of getting my spot for the night.
The descent was pretty uneventful, I wrote a quick note in the Hurd brook shelter log as I moved through and kept pushing, making good progress. Finally, I reached a long section of bog bridges which signaled my proximity to the road and sure enough I could heard logging trucks in the distance. The last half mile of trail was wonderfully flat and devoid of roots and rocks and I cruised. I snapped a quick picture with the ""There is nothing for the next 100mi"" sign that marked the northern end of the 100mi wilderness and emerged onto the Golden Road. 
I crossed a bridge which had one lane for trucks and an entire seperate bridge from snowmobiles and stopped the admire the view of Katahdin from the bridge. Standing in the middle of the Penobscott River the rocky peak of Katahdin had finally freed itself of clouds and shown in the morning sun surrounded by crisp blue sky. The gray of the rocky summit yielded to various greens of trees on the mountains flanks which were interrupted in spots where rockfalls had cascaded down the steep slopes and left the path littered with boulders. 
I snapped a few pictures and finished crossing the bridge, coming to the store and campground. My watch read 10:15, which meant that I had covered the 14.5mi from camp this morning in just under 5 hours... not bad, not bad at all. I blew past the store and headed for the entrance to the park, eager to get my name on the list. After that I could go back, get some food at the store, and relax for a couple hours before doing the next 10mi up to The Birches. 
Before I got there I ran into Longjohn, the ""trail steward"" for the area who was tasked with dispensing info about Baxter to long distance hikers and to help them figure out their plans. He informed me that there were only 6 names on the list so far and that it was frowned upon to sign up to hold yourself a spot and then double back to hang out at the store. Well shucks... I figured as long as I kept a count of how many hikers passed me I could still get a spot and headed back to the store. I picked up a couple of items... a mini apple pie, a bag of chips, a bottle of orange juice, and a 6 pack of apple juice in a can and enjoyed them outside and chatted with a couple of other hikers who were hanging around. And I also got 2 scoops of muddy sneakers ice cream, cause why not?
Not long after the hikers I had passed on the trail started showing up, Caboose and Engine, Sarge and Pudge, Tiptoe and Honeysticks and Jam, but none of them were planning on heading into the park until the next day, so they weren't my competition. The store had no cell phone reception and the only way of communication was a satellite phone the store charged $1/min to use or a ranger's radio. And it turned out that LongJohn had one. As he does for hikers, he volunteered to call up to the ranger station and see if there were any campsites available for the night, which would mean that I wouldn't have to worry about a spot at the birches. After a couple minutes of back and forth on the radio, it turned out that there was a spot available at Abol Campground, which was 2mi down the tote road from Katahdin Stream Campground. I'd have to get myself down to the campground and back, but as long as I could get myself there tonight (and I was fairly confident in finding a hitch from on of the day visitors to the park) Topbunk could meet me there tonight, have a place to sleep, and then we could both drive back to Katahdin Stream in the morning and head up the mountain. Plans made, I not longer had to worry about getting a spot at Katahdin Stream and could spend as long as I wanted here. Having Longjohn here to help thru hikers is a super helpful gesture from Baxter, which is known for not being the easiest/most hiker friendly portion of the trail.At 11am the restaurant opened and we all sat down to get some beer and burgers. The waitress confused most of our beer orders, and I was super sad when she took back the 22oz cider she had brought me, dumped it out, and then poured another 16oz cider for me... what a waste of cider!! Not to mention that I would've taken the 22oz if she had given me the chance. The food was delicious, we all ended up ordering almost exactly the same thing... a burger with fried egg and bacon on top. Jam got the lobster roll, which the waitress somehow confused as spring rolls, which Jam jokingly pointed out was a somewhat stereotypical mistake to make on the only asian guy's order. After the meal I waited around for a bit more, hoping Lost would catch up, but everyone else started migrating off to the campsite across the street (they weren't entering Baxter until tomorrow) and the clock struck 2pm and I figured I had better get moving if I was going to make it before the ranger station closed at 7pm. I shouldered my pack, got another scoop of ice cream, and headed into the park.Besides immediately getting swarmed with mosquitoes, the 10miles up to Katahdin Stream were wonderful trail. Not too rocky, following the Penobscot river for a couple miles before running into a larger tributary and following that upstream, the sun shone and the trees provided shade and kept the temperature down. I enjoyed a can or two of apple juice on my way up, and realizing that I was going to make it with plenty of time (I was 3mi away by 430pm), I stopped by one of the rivers to hang out for 30min and take a swim, not unaware that these were my last couple miles of actual hiking.Moving again, I passed Dorsey pond, where a number of people were out in canoes, and followed the trail as it wound up and over some hills, the trail soft and gentle under my feet, perhaps as recompense for the past 500miles of rocks or perhaps lulling me into a false sense of security for the hard miles tomorrow. At last though, the trail popped out onto a road which I followed past a series of lean-tos (a shelter that you can rent... the exact same type I had been sleeping in/near for the past couple months, but all to yourself... what a (lonely) concept) and I emerged into a parking lot/small field which I recognized from the last time I had been here. Just past the bridge which spanned the unreasonably clear water of Katahdin stream I came to the ranger station and signed in, long distance hiker 1544 for the year and NOBO 372.1544 seems like a lot of hikers, and taking out the 372 NOBOs still leaves 1200 SOBOs, which seems like far too high a number, but its hard to draw conclusions from it since long distance hikers are classified as anyone hiking farther than the 100mi wilderness. Not that it was the goal, but I am pretty happy about my number... I was NOBO 1456 to start from Amicola, 655 to pass through Harpers Ferry, and now 372 to arrive at Katahdin, which meant I halved my position with each leg of the trip. And its pretty cool that they give you a little card (both as your permit and something to keep). I still had to find my was another 2mi down to Abol campground, which I really didn't want to have to walk, but it turned out that there was a ranger program about the history of the park and the trails going on tonight, and the KS ranger was pretty sure the Abol ranger was coming, so I decided to hang around for another hour and listen to the program and see if I couldn't bum a ride back down the road after. Worse comes to worse I have to walk it... I've done that. I setup my tent in the small field so that I could dry it out in the last of the afternoon sun, and got a number of looks from the day hikers which seemed to say ""you know you can't camp there?"" (which I was aware), but none of them had the courage to tell the dirty hobo that. I changed into camp clothes and started eating through that snacks that I wouldn't need for tomorrow while I waited. The ranger program was quite interesting... she talked about when the various trails were established and how they had been rerouted throughout the years. I also found it interesting how much work goes into trails... Baxter has at least 4 full time trail crews which are constantly working on the trails (mainly they handle the reroutes) as well as a bunch of volunteer groups (including MATC, which handles most of the AT within the park) and a lot of work goes into the park every spring to clear the blowdowns from the winter. One of the other attendees of the presentation was Snap's husband and was waiting on her to get to Katahdin and was going to summit with her, so I was able to inform him that I had stayed with Snap at White House Landing 2 nights before and that she should be here soon. The ranger was nice enough to give me a ride down to Abol campground (though she forced me to ride in the back of the pickup truck... park policy... oh shucks), and it was a lovely ride as the pickup flew down the road to the campground, the night air already had a refreshing crispness which seemed to foreshadow the coming of fall. I setup camp, grabbed some water from the spigot attached to the ranger's cabin (what luxury), and started cooking dinner while the sun set and I waited for TopBunk to arrive. About halfway through my dinner my stove ran out of fuel (talk about timing... 2more min of fuel would've been all I needed to finish the trail), so I let it continue to sit so that the noodles would soften. TopBunk arrived just before 9pm with the sun already set (what a difference... a coupe months ago it would've still been light out) and she setup camp while we caught up. We didn't stay up long though... it was past my bedtime and we had a long day tomorrow.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to
",Abol Campground,"Aug 16, Wed",24.90
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578090,"We got up at 450 (I overslept from my 430 alarm and I was TopBunk's alarm) and got packed up in the crisp morning air. The sun had yet to rise but by the time we were packed up there was enough light to see without a headlamp and we hopped in the car and drove the 2mi down to Katahdin Stream campground, the first car in the day-use lot. 
And then I realized that I didn't have my phone after searching my bag and the car. Well shit. We piled back in and drove back to Abol campground and ended up finding my phone on the side of the road just before the campground. I had taken it out of my camp shorts when changing into my hiking shorts and put it on the top of the car and left it there. It had fallen off as soon as we had accelerated out of the campground and was thankfully unharmed on the side of the road. Normally I'm pretty good at keeping track of my stuff, but normally the only place it can be is in my pack. The car is throwing off my routines...
Anyways, back to Katahdin Stream and we hit the trail at 610am, the second car in the lot. Though the rangers recommend taking a day pack up the mountain (and will provide one if you need), I opted to take my full pack and gear setup. I had a couple of reasons... 
1) since I had no food left my bag was super light and small anyways (at least compared to what I was used to, especially through the 100mi).
2) I had spent the last 2185mi optimizing my gear so that I had exactly what I needed to survive outdoors... I saw no reason to now leave some of it behind. 
3) I wouldn't say I fall a lot... but I fall often enough on rock and my pack is a great shock absorber. The more I had in it, the comfier it is to land on my back! 
4) I had carried this pack and my gear up every single mountain between here and Georgia, I saw no reason to not carry it up one more, dammit.
So we headed up the mountain in the early dawn light. The trail started flat and dirty but soon began pretty rocky and started climbing gradually. We came to Katahdin Stream, its aqua-colored mountain water cascading down a series of pools under the wooden bridge we crossed, and then to Katahdin Stream Falls, a larger set of falls which sent water shooting out into the air over a granite cliff. From there the climb began in earnest and we headed up a couple of rocky slabs. TopBunk groaned a bit as we hit that section and, drawing on my previous experiences with this mountain, I smirked to myself a bit... this was still the easy part.
The trail continued uphill amongst the trees, the walking punctuated by short scrambles which began more and more common until the trail was entirely rock hopping and pulling yourself up with trees. We both stowed a pole to allow for a free hand to grasp rocks and continued upwards, approaching the tree line over a series of progressively more challenging scrambles, some hard enough that several bypass trails had been worn into the mountain which offered a range of difficulty options in going around. 
As we hiked it was obvious that the wind was at least matching, but probably exceeding the 25mph gusts that the weather report had called for, and so I stopped for a moment to extract my windbreaker from my clothes bag and stow it in a more accessible location. We finally came to the tree line and emerged into a whole new world. As soon as I had mounted the rock face which jutted above the trees I was nearly knocked over by a gust of wind and had to duck down to stabilize myself. TopBunk was not far behind me and we scrambled from sheltered alcove to sheltered alcove, finding nooks in the rocks to duck into out of the wind for a moment of rest and to regroup.
I stowed my second pole, in full scrambling mode now, and donned my windbreaker and then shortly after my puffy under it (which I've never used while hiking before). The wind continued to tear at us as we climbed up the rocky flank of the mountain and each movement had to be planned to take into account the inopportunely timed wind gust which would inevitably hit and force me to brace on a nearby rock. The though that this probably wasn't the safest time to summit did cross my mind, but I hoped that this wind was just affecting this face of the mountain and the top might be calmer. Plus, I walked a long way to summit this mountain... and so we continued on. 
I even ended up putting on my long johns, which are only ever supposed (according to my rules) to be used in camp, to help me keep a bit warmer as we climbed. And that folks is why I personally don't like to slackpack. Had I slacked today, I would've left my camp clothes behind and would've been without the puffy jacket and long johns which were keeping me warm. Never know what you're going to need!
Eventually the trail wound to the other side of the ridge and provided us with a bit more protection from the wind. As we climbed the view around us was awe-inspiring, even compared the vistas I had become used to seeing along the trail. To our right hundreds of lakes dotted the landscape and eventually morphed into distant mountains and I could pick out several of the lakes I had walked by, including the one we had ridden across to get to White House landing. I could see Abol bridge that I had walked across yesterday to exit the 100mi wilderness and trace the rivers that I had walked along through Baxter to get to Katahdin Stream campground. To our left the other peaks in the area reached skywards, the huge, sheer cliffs of Owls Nest our equal for a time and four other peaks, standing watch over a huge forested highland plateau. Behind us and to the northwest an endless expanse of trees seemed to stretch to the horizon, only interrupted by a few lonely mountains. In every direction not a shread of civilization was visible amongst the sea of trees and water.
The Hunt trail follows a ridge which ascends a nearly-vertical looking ridge, a daunting piece of rock-work to gaze at from the bottom. About a mile of scrambling brought us to The Gateway, a transition from the steep rocky scramble and onto the flatlands of the alpine tundra. From here we could finally see the peak in the distance and a couple spots of color marked other hikers ascending the sloping rockfield towards the summit. Here the poles came back out, as we were back to walking, and we passed Thoreau spring, joined with the Abol trail, and headed for the summit. 
The ocasional mountain-induced cloud passed over us but overall the winds were much lower and the weather pleasant for us. As I drew closer I could pick out human figures amassed at the summit around The Sign, which grew larger with every step. And then we were there. The Sign. The northern terminus of the Appalachian trail. The iconic summit photo. Right there. The sign was surrounded by a several other thru hikers who had just finished and a number of day hikers, many of whom offered congratulations.
I tagged the sign as I walked up and took a couple pictures in various positions with the sign. Not ready to leave, TopBunk and I hunkered down on the south face of the mountain in a rocky nook that offered some shelter from the wind and had lunch and some celebratory apple juice from a can that I had carried up. From our dining location we admired the aforementioned views. I ended up lending TopBunk my sleeping bag liner to use to stay warm with while we hung out on the summit and ate, another item that I was grateful I hadn't left behind.
Finally, at about 11am we had finished eating and took a final look around, admiring the jagged peaks and precipitous cliffs of knife's edge which we had elected not to do today due to the winds. All the while we had been up at the summit more and more people had been arriving, those who hiked slower or started a bit later than us finally reaching the top, and by the time we left it was quite busy and there was a bit of a line for pictures with the sign. Not quite the same as the secluded mountain tops that thru hikers often get to experience, but what can ya do? Besides night hike...
The descent was pretty uneventful. The wind was still blowing on the scramble section but had calmed since our ascent and didn't cause any problems. We ended up hiking down the mountain with a new SOBO hiker (as of yet unnamed) who was just starting his hike and chatted with him for a while. Eventually we found ourselves back on the flat dirty section of the trail and I ended up a little ahead of TopBunk. The blazes already had a different feeling... I now knew, I had verified that they indeed led all the way to Gerogia. But now they were just leading me back to my car, not out into the woods in search of adventure, back to the real world.
We ended up taking a quick survey for a student who had setup camp at the trailhead and was offering free fruit snacks in exchange for a couple answers and then plopped back into the car. On the way out of Baxter we saw a guy walking along the side of the road and stopped to pick him up... time to rebuild some of my hitching karma. We ended up finding two more hikers at various stages of walking out of the park and picked them up too, my car now stuffed with smelly hikers (thankfully I still couldn't smell us) and gear. 
We drove them out to Millinocket and chatted a bit. The older gentleman had just finished his last section of the AT, a goal that he had been working on for a number of years, and had hiked from Hanover, NH to Katahdin this year. The guy and girl had done the PCT two years ago and had burned through the AT in ~100days and were already planning on doing the CDT next yet. They commented on how they had enjoyed the PCT alot more than the AT, which they found overcrowded and more difficult than the PCT, but, in my inexpert opinion, I could see how you'd think that after pushing as many miles are they were, probably not really stopping long to enjoy the hostels along the trail, and blowing past most of the other hikers out there too quickly to make friends. HYOY, glad they finished. 
We dropped them in Millinocket, got ice cream, and then hit the road, driving south along the Maine turnpike towards my uncle's house. I will say, I do prefer driving to being a passenger in a car nowadays... having no control over the 2ton hunk of metal flyign down the highway at 80mph just doesn't seem like a very good idea. New perspective from the AT, perhaps. 
TopBunk and I arrived there at about 7pm and took advantage of the shower and delicious home cooked meal before heading to bed. Still a long way to get back home.","Abol Campground
",Katahdin,"Aug 17, Thu",10.40
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578091,"TopBunk and I woke up this morning, had a delicious breakfast of eggs, bacon, pancakes, and pie, and then hit the road by 8am. We drove over towards Gorham, NH, passing the large windfarm that I had seen in the distance from several mountain tops along the trail and the sky opened up on us, sheets of rain pounding the windshield and turning the road into a river. I know that driving amplifies how intense rain seems, but this would still be pretty gnarly to be out hiking in, although as long as there weren't any large mountains in my path for the day I'd have already accepted the fact that I was as wet as I could possibly be, that the rain couldn't do anything more to me, moved on, and probably still had a pretty good day hiking.
We stopped at a small cafe in Gorham so that I could catch up on my journaling but the wifi didn't actually work so we ended up piling back into the car heading west. We did make a quick stop at mcdonalds (a hiking habit that I'm going to have to work on breaking) for lunch in town and then headed out, passing just north of the White mountains. I'm sure the Whites would be quite an adventure on a day like today... shrouded in swirling clouds whipping past in the wind, perhaps like the morning of the day that I summited Washington. From my vantage point I could see the clouds flowing around and between the mountains, their whispy tendrils emphasizing the contours of the land.
We got rained on many more times on the way over into VT but thankfully the weather cleared as we got to the Ben and Jerry's factory. We pulled up into a much large parking lot than I had anticipated, walked up to the factory, and were greeted by a veritable zoo of people milling about, an insane line of people waiting to get ice cream, a shorter line of people waiting to get tickets for a tour, and many more wandering around somewhere in between those activities. The TV behind the desk announced that the next tour with spots available was for an hour and a half from now...
And we turned around and left. Call it culture shock, but there were just too many people around for me to spend an hour and a half waiting for a tour, which in and of itself was much too long to spend in my opinion anyways. So we hopped back in the car and headed for Rutland, VT, getting rained on several more times along the way. 
At the state park in Killington I caught sight of a white blaze on the side of the road as we drove past and soon enough we passed the Long Trail Inn (the old AT/LT crossing) and then shortly after the new AT/LT crossing as we headed down to town. I was originally planning on spending the night at the yellow deli, but was talked out of it/decided it was a bad idea. Its hard to tell how much of the good time I had there was due to the people that I was with and how much was the place itself. More than likely I'd look for something similar to my last experience here and be disappointed when the good time I had this time didn't quite measure up to last time. I also didn't quite know how I felt about using a hiker amenity. 
For the past 4.5months I've identified as a hiker... a thru hiker, and that title and that identity gave me leave to do things that fit in the with hiker culture... grow my beard out, stay at hiker hostels, be dirty and not shower. But right now, though I still know all the slang and have had all the same experiences and feel like I still fit it, mentally I'm not a hiker. I finished my hike. I made it. Like it or not I'm back in the real world and have to adjust to that. And I'm not really sure what identity takes the place of hiker right now. At some point, presumably I'll go back to what I used to be... engineer, dancer, outdoorsman, but right now I'm neither there nor a hiker. It's a weird identity limbo that I didn't anticipate and kinda bummed me out most of the day.
Anyways, we made it over to Troy, NY, stopped in at the cookie factory (a local bakery) to pick up some treats and then headed downtown and got dinner at Dinosaur BBQ. TopBunk and I split some poutine and a pulled pork platter and then headed over to a cheap hotel we had found to veg for the rest of the night.
So that's that, the first zero of the rest of my life.",,"Troy, NY","Aug 18, Fri",0
Crusher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578471,"Little bit of a post trail adventure....
So Lost had taken a couple days off to go back home and see some friends and flew back to Reagan and since I live pretty close I went and picked her up. It was really good to see her again... trail friendships are a little weird, I had only known her for a little over a month, and there are people on the trail that I knew for even less than that, and yet you spend all your waking (and non-waking) hours with those people that you get to know them a lot quicker than you do with people you only see once a day, or once a week in normal life. Also, out on the trail, you see a lot of a person very quickly... when they're tired, dirty, happy, first thing in the morning, when they're hurting, etc, which also doesn't happen in real life in which you usually see people in pretty well siloed social circumstances (work or dance or friend, etc). Anyways.
It was good to see her again and we had plenty of time to catch up (from the past 7 days we hadn't seen each other) while we sat in DC traffic heading out to Harpers Ferry. We stopped in Frederick at Pizza and Pretzel creations and enjoyed calzones and a chocolate stuffed, cinnamon coated pretzel... prefect hiker food. We got to the ATC before it closed so that Lost could get her second picture in the logbook (which is common for flip floppers) and I got to flip through and see how long after Lookout and I all of our friends had come through. Done with that, we headed down to a grocery store for a resupply, which was also a little weird because my brain just automatically went into resupply mode and started scanning the shelves for hiker food... instant potatoes, ramen, oatmeal, etc, even though I wasn't actually shopping for anything. Well, I ended up leaving with some grapes to snack on.
The sun starting to set, we headed back to the trail so that Lost could get moving, and after repacking the food into her bag we hugged... and I graped her. I had never heard of it, but in the car she had explained that her and her sister used to do this to eachother, where you run up and squash a grape on the other person. And I had grapes. So... yea... she'll probably get me back for it, but what are trail friends for?
Anyways, a couple days later I got a text ""Soooo.... hiking the Shenandoah with your old pal, Lost..."" and not too long after that I was in the car headed out to Shenandoah. Call it a relapse, but I didn't have anything pressing going on at home, so why not? I met her at Skyland and she had already gotten a cabin for the night (since it was supposed to rain) and we ended up spending the night catching me up on the 3 Game of Thrones episodes I had missed since we had last watched (since I don't have HBO and apparently don't have any friends that watch GoT at home).",,Skyland,"Aug 28, Mon",0
