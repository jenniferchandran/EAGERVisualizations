Okie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552205,"I was born in St. Petersburg FL. Around 1973 I did a week hike on the A/T with three other friends. I retired from Florida and moved up to GA in 2002. I've done a small amount of hiking on near by trails and a little day hikes on the A/T.My wife and I are currently in the process of moving to OK and have purchased a house in Edmond, OK. I selected the trail name Okie due to the move but actually have more roots in FL & GA.Due to the duration and miles of the A/T being greater than previous hikes I will being adding information to this trail journal on attempting to go UL. My goal will be to obtain a pack weight of less than 30 #'s. My current body weight is 160#'s.","

Okie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557396,"I spent the day loading everything in my pack including food to get me easily to Neels Gap. Pack weight was 27 - 28 pounds including a quart of water. I also started entering much of my gear to the gear list. I then reviewed current hiker entries around the start of the trail. Hiker journals indicated they had hail during the last couple of days which devastated several of the hikers. Seems like the weather they are having currently is in the low 40's. My weather search for Dawsonville, GA. (By Amicalola Falls) shows 70 - 55 degrees with 40% scattered showers.",,None,"Mar 23, Thu",0
Okie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557955,Start my hike with Buz who retired from same job. Went thru Arches at Park opening at 8:39 right after breakfast at the lodge. We both had 28 pound packs. The steps we the falls was a great warm up challenge for the start of a possible 6 month thru hike. 8.2 miles landed us on Springer Mountain being the official start of the trail. After signing the log book we hiked 2.8 miles further to Stover Creek shelter and due to reported rain decided to stay in the shelter.

Okie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557969,"Decided we wanted to plan for spending time at Neels Gap which was further than we wanted yet for one day so we headed for Lance Creek. Still on and off with rain suits. Shortly after noon we hit Woody Gap where GA 60 crossed. As we crossed the large parking lot Buz headed for the out building and I looked over and saw two young ladies yelling and waving for me to come over. As I neared their table I realized we just came across our 1st trail magic. They opened up three pizza boxes and it did take but a second former to grab from the first box opened. Hot pizza, power aid, banana did not take long for me to consume. Our angles were Dana and Emma who completed their thru hike in 5 months and decided to offer trail magic to give back some of the hospitality they had received. We talked probably one error half hour picking their experiences and took off at a slow pace but happy. We hiked a total of 9.8 miles ending the day at Lance Creek set up for 6 tent pads. Well we were a little concerned because after setting up our tents I counted 17 tents. Buz waited until after dark, skinned his light on the outside of my tent and spoke in a very low voice ""Forest Ranger I need to see your permit for the non-equipped site"". Had me fooled for a moment we might need bailed out of jail. Tremendous rain,lightening, and thunder.","Justus Creek

Most hikers used Sawyer water filters which does not kill the virus. I carry the SteriPen ultra which uses ultraviolet light to alter the virus DNA making it safe to drink. I sent about 20 minutes treating many other hikers water. During the day we hiked Blood Mountain which is the tallest Mtn. On the A/T in Georgia at 4,457.","Neels Gap

Okie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558966,"Started the day early and packed our tents in the dry around 7:15. Started raining during hike. Hiked through canopies of trees and then hit Albert Mountain. I thought I was hiking but told Buz I considered going up Albert was more like Mountain climbing. The top of Albert had a Fire Tower. 2 tenths of a mile past the fire tower we hit the 100 mile mark. We continued on and met a couple that picked our minds for tips. Buz started hiking while I was showing them my Guthook phone app. By then I was a few minutes behind so I started to jog up the trail. While jogging I kept looking down and accidently took a side trail off the A/T. The trail about 200 yards later end at a cliff. Back tracking and now way behind. Took me approximately 1 hour to catch up. By around 2:15 we completed 12.2 more miles, reached a Forest Service Parking lot and met with a shuttle driver, David, 93 years old world War II vet who flew P-38 planes on the European front.
