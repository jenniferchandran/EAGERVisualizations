Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564891,Breakfast at Front Royal Diner with Pam than drove the hour or so to Harpers Ferry. Registered for my section hike and Dave dropped me off and drove away. Kind of a boring day. Lots of rocks already. Not a whole lot of big views. Ed Garvey Shelter is cute. Met Nemophilist there. She started her thru hike on the south side of Shenandoah. Went the long steep 0.4 miles down to water. Ugh but I needed water. Passed on through Gathland State Park and continued on all the way to Rocky Run Shelters. There are two shelters here. Arrived at 7 pm. My feet are having a hard time getting  used to my trail runners. Soaked them in the creek while waiting for dinner to rehydrate. There are several others here but all in tents. Too nice to be in the shelters. Nice day.,"Harpers Ferry WV

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565043,"Woke up at 5:15 and couldn't go back to sleep. Went and got my food bag and made coffee.  Made some scramble egg breakfast tortillas, packed up and on trail by 6:30! Hiked almost 2 miles and found a free shower at Dahlgren Backback campground. Also charged my phone and got rid of trash. Starting off to be a great day. Testing out my Swiftwick socks today. Love them so far. The trail is smooth today too. Arrived at Washington  Monument State Park at 9am. Met DoRag. He didn't even come 0.1 off trail to see the monument because he is doing the 4  state challenge and started at midnight this morning. Sounds miserable. I took my shoes off   and went up barefoot. Nice cold stones! Most of today was just kind of boring. Stopped at Annapolis Rocks. The elevation is just not high enough for me. Very hot today. I stopped more often and put my feet in water. Found a little campsite before the creek at Warner Gap Hollow. Hunters are out and have been shooting all day long. I am camped too close to them. Talked to Dave in the phone. He is home now. He could hear the shooting in the background. Hope I don't get shot tonight.","Rocky Run Shelters

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565195,"Hiked out at 7:30am. Uphill to an unknown rock top view. Continued on and met Linda, Phil, I think, and dog Scout. Collectively Bounders. They have two cars and bound ahead and hike south. Met some guys who started at Harpers Ferry on Sun and Mon and are thru hiking. Patrick and Permethius (fire god?) Got to a cool place called High  Rock by 9 am. Graffiti covered rock may have been old fire tower. Redleg took my pic for me. Also here was Wizard another I can't remember name. Deb and Colie, a mother and daughter hiking together found me at Pen Mar Park and gave me their leftover food since they were getting a package in Waynesboro. Trail Magic from a hiker! MD-PA border by 1pm.  After reaching the border it seemed like the miles just flew by. Next thing I knew I was going up from 1000' elevation to 1900' elevation to Chimney Rocks! Beautiful up there. I decided to go on in to South Mountain to what used to be the Tavern. Still there but called motel. Had a burger, fries and beer! They have an outdoor shower and said I can set up my tent but there is a drunk named Billy here and I haven't decided as of 9:30 pm. Well it is 10:30 and almost everyone has left. I will tent here tonight.","Warner Gap Hollow

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565264,I didn't get much sleep last night. Traffic went into the night and began in the weeee morning. I walked back to the trail at 7. Thought the 5 miles to town would be a piece of cake. Well it was some terrible boulder barf most of the way. I got to the road about 10 am and decided to call the Scottish Inn. Nikki picked me up and brought me the 3.5 miles or so. Shower and then breakfast at the Flamingo Diner! Will do chores and doctor my feet. Looks like rain tonight. I plan to head out tomorrow.,"South Mountain, PA

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565455,"Had breakfast at 6 am at the Flamingo. Packed up and found Nikki. She took me to the post office where I mailed home winter type stuff. Hope it's not a mistake sending home my long johns. Then she dropped me off on the trail at 9:15. Today's trail was so lovely. First was Caledonia State Park where the trail meandered on the edge of the park. Lots of folks out today with lots of dogs. It is the weekend and the temp is in the 60's. What a difference from yesterday's muggy hot steam bath. About 1 pm I arrived at the PATC cabin where there was a Boy Scout troop getting water. I ate lunch and talked a little. Later I met Tink and Think who are from Florida. Avid outdoor enthusiasts who have ridden their bikes from Florida to Oregon in one single trip! Wow! I find myself just a little envious of couples who do these things together. I also met a fun hiking group called the Wackos! They are from TX and LA. They started hiking sections many years ago and began another on the 17th. They are staying in a cabin while they do long day hikes. What a fun group. Thank you for the huge oatmeal cookie! I posted the picture with them in photos. Hope to stay in touch with them. When I arrived at Toms Run Shelter it was noisy with lots of folks out tenting for the weekend. I found a little stealth campsite 0.2 miles past them next to a lovely creek. Made stroganoff for dinner. Soaked my feet in the creek and then hung my food bag in a tree. I have not seen any bear scat but since I am so good at hanging my bag, thanks to Qinti, I might as well be safe. I will sleep better. It was really a perfect day today with lovely gentle trails. I hiked all day in my sandals. My feet are happy","Fayetteville

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565524,The hoot owls made noise all night long. Got up early and made coffee and a breakfast burrito and hit the trail. Immediately saw the halfway marker! It's on wheels so it can be moved as the trail distance is always changing. I arrived at Pine Grove Furnace at 8:15 am. Met Trippin here. She began in Springer back in February but has spent some time off trail. I had a chicken quesadilla with avocado from the store grill. Saved half for lunch. Found out the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel was closed. Happy I decided not to come all the way here last night. Checked out the AT Museum and signed the log. The trail was nice again today. I decided to go to church this evening and was able to send a message to Carlisle Church of Christ. Member and my trail angel Ann picked me up PA 94 at 4:30 and brought me to town. Went to Arby's first and then service at 6 pm. Such a wonderful congregation. Everyone was genuinely interested in my crazy hike! After church Ann brought me back to the trail after stopping at McDonalds first for a milkshake! Thank you so very much Ann for everything! I hiked just a mile in and found the campsite by the stream. There were a few other tents on the other side. Hung my food bag and soaked my feet. Still having a little trouble with my right pinky toe. I was able to hike in my shoes today without the insoles.  Might be sandals tomorrow though. There is a huge section of about 18 miles where camping is not allowed. From here it would be about 22. I don't think I will push it. I think I will break it up and head to Carlisle. We'll see.,"Stream past Toms Run Shelter

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565578,"I have decided to relax today. Did 8.1 miles in to Boiling Springs today. Today was kind of fun. I enjoyed the Rock Maze and then the gentle walk through the corn field. I messed up and didn't notice the trail to the view at Center Point Knob. This knob was the original AT midpoint. It took me 4 hours to go the 8 miles today but I took more breaks too. This is a really cute little town. I had a fantastic raspberry white chocolate latte and then a salmon ceaser salad. Was able to get in touch by way of message with a lady who has bunks for hikers with sheets!  Thank you Iceman for the phone number. I think my pinky toe needs the rest of the day off. Lisa from Buck Off Hostel picked up a bunch of us at the AT Conservancy. She has 5 bunks and others can tent. Beaker, Ringer and 1stSarge are here. Also is a young girl named Spitfire hiking a long section SOBO, and the mom and daughter team, Tenacity and CurlyQ. Sat around the fire while clothes washed and we ate hot dogs or grilled cheese. I am sleeping on the third level top bunk. Hope I don't have to get down and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.","Campsite at AT mile 1112.9

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565773,"I had a hard time sleeping last night. I think it was a combination of this hard thin mattress, the internet, the bright Christmas lights right outside, some snoring, and the fact there was really no sheets just a blanket and and old flat pillow. I used my sleeping bag on top of the quilt that was on the mattress. I need to go back into the woods for good sleep. I am writing this at 4 am while I listen to snoring with my earplugs in. And now the roosters have started crowing! I went ahead and got up about 5 and made some coffee. Waited for Shane to leave for work and jumped in his jeep for a ride to the AT conservancy. Had a great breakfast at Cafe 101 and was on the trail by 9. The trail was super lovely and flat meandering through fields and meadows for about 13 miles. I made great time. I met the Wackos again out hiking today. Lois called themselves that and it might stick with me but Francis wants a different group name. You guys are such an awesome group. Give me a new name and I will change it!  The trail went up steeply to Darlington Shelter. It was only about 2 pm so I continued on. Saw Early Bird and Thor again.   Got a pic with Thor. They drive up north and always hike south. I'm sure I'll see them again. I got water at the last stream before going up to Cove Mountain. I carried extra this time hoping to find a stealth campsite and not have to go to the Shelter but did not have any luck. I arrived at Coved Mountain Shelter at 6:30pm and tried to set up my tent I what I thought was flat. I had a hard time finding ground without rocks and my stakes just didn't work. I decided to just head to the shelter. There are 4 men here. A father and son team, staying in the Shelter and two others out in their tents. They are not hiking together but are all doing some sectioning. I have 4 miles to Duncannon tomorrow. I don't plan to stay there just eat and grab some supplies.","Boiling Springs

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565947,"Oh my, this man in the shelter can snore! I got off the bunk and went and reset up my tent at 12:30am! Finally got some sleep. Was on trail by 7 and about 30 minutes in, a young man named Dakota hiked with me asking me all kinds of questions. He lives in Duncannaon and just finished high school and comes up here all the time. At first I was annoyed because he hiked so close behind me but later found him to be good company. He told me all about the town. He took my pic for me at Hawk Rock. I wish so so bad I would have gone one more mile to the sweet campsite up there. We hiked down talking the whole way and at 8:20 I was in town. Time just flew by. I went to the Sunoco to clean up and he went home. Oh breakfast at Goodie's was super delicious. Met Splint here. He is raising money for Make-A-Wish Foundation. He is going north so I will see him again I am sure. The hikers I have met this year are pretty amazing. I am really enjoying this years hike. Feels like my first year again! I did not enjoy walking through town to get back on the trail. I did stop at The Old Sled Works antique mall. I thought I read they had ice cream floats but it was old fashioned sodas. I didn't get anything and walked the 0.4 miles back to the trail. The trail goes across the freeway bridge. Ugh! I felt like Dustin Hoffman in Rainman. The trail climbs straight up out of town. Great views. At Clark's Ferry Shelter I met NoRush, who is camping here tonight, ToughBroad, and her husband Bearsweatz here to get water also. They Hiked the PCT thru in 2016 for their honeymoon. They hiked on and so did I. The rocks were not bad today. The other fantastic view today was at Table Rock. The elevation was only 1333' but the view was amazing. Slightly overcast all afternoon. I arrived at Peters Mtn Shelter just after 6 and thought about staying inside but there were lots of stinky hikers and Halfway admitted he snores. I pitched my tent. Made some mac n cheese and talked with section hiker Hans. Also met Rattler who had thru hiked back in the 80's. Gave me some pointers about what's to come in the rest of PA. I love my tent spot tonight. There is a 90% chance of rain but not major rain. Hope it's just light. I will sleep well.","Cove Mountain Shelter
",Peters Mtn Shelter ,"May 24, Wed",15
Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566212,The rain began at 2 am. I still slept really well last night. Got all my stuff gathered up and went to the shelter at 5:45am. Halfway was already leaving. He doesn't carry a tent and he has to get to the shelter to grab space. The shelter was 18 miles away. Made coffee and eggs but put too much water in the bag so I drank soupy eggs. Hiked out in the rain. Not heavy rain but just steady regular rain all day. Today had a long steady 3.5 mile climb up from 550' to 1650' elevation. As I was hiking up a tiny fawn got spooked and ran up the trail about 30 feet. It was a very rocky area and that fawn couldn't have been but a week old. The longest skinniest legs I have seen on such a tiny deer. No views today. I can't say it was miserable but I was cold. My feet were just soaked. I have been hiking with no insoles for some toe space and I think it was great not to have soaked insoles. I love my Swiftwick socks. They are awesome in rain. This has been my first day in rain since I have been on the trail. I arrived at the sign for Rausch Gap Shelter at 4:30 but since I new I wouldn't be in the shelter I hiked on to the most incredible campsite on the trail so far. I feel like I am in Maine! It is north of the bridge at Rausch Creek. The rain had let up about 3 and when I arrive and set up I was able to hang things up to dry. Priority was washing the stickiest socks I have ever had. Rain just makes me stink. I made myself a huge pot of Knorr chicken pasta and rice and ate it all. I will head to Lickdale tomorrow. I need to resupply but I am getting a room. My clothes are bad. Oh the stench!,"Peters Mtn Shelter

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566214,"This morning is beautiful! It was an Amy Grant morning. This is my fathers world: I rest me in the thought, of rocks and trees of skies and seas; His hand the wonders wrought. Perfect words for today.  Left camp and found the cemetery. As I was walking back to the trail I was met by two hikers, Friendly Ghost and his wife Beatle. They are here from Copenhagen and both love hiking. The trail immediately went up to Second Mountain. As I came down I was in a beautiful field. This trail truly is just amazing. I crossed a couple of roads and arrived at Swatera Gap. There is a pretty iron bridge at the Gap. I walked about 1.5 miles toward Lickdale before a man and his father offered me a ride. They dropped me at the Comfirt Inn where there was not s car in the lot. The clerk told me they do not have hiker rates and because it is opening weekend for Hershey Amusement park they were very busy. Gave me a huge price and told me the room would not be ready until 4. It was 11:30am! I called the days Inn and they gave a better price. When I got there they gave me a room for $119.00. Best price in town. Better than the price though was a room downstairs with no windows. I loved it. Did the usual chores but can't find much hiker food. Got a pizza to pack out with me tomorrow.","Stealth campsite at AT mile 1176.2

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566350,"Met a man named Jerry and his wife Karen at breakfast this morning. We were talking about the trail and they told me they were from Virginia and were here to go to the outlet malls. I asked if they wouldn't mind to take me to the trailhead. Jerry dropped me off at 8:20 am. Thank you so much for the ride Jerry. Hope you had fun shopping! Later I reached for my Vapur water bottle and it wasn't there. It slipped out of my side pouch in the trunk of my trail angels car. Oh so so sad about this. I need that bottle! I still have a water bottle. I met Ultra right when I got on the trail. He started at Springer on March 23rd I think he said. Moving fast. The trail went up immediately and then was just all rocks all day long. Today was the toughest day I have had yet. Met Sideshow and his dog, What, taking a break on the rocks. He hiked half the trail in 2012 and the other other on 14. Several people are out for this Memorial weekend. Lots of beautiful views of the valley and farms below.  Arrived at Hertline Campsite area at 5:30 pm. My feet were just done. Sat up my tent and soaked my feet in the beautiful creek and ate leftover pizza. Then I went over and chatted with my neighbor, Carl, who was out for two nights. Found a great tree to hang my food bag. I notice many weekend campers don't do this. I really don't think there are any bears in PA. Haha right! I'm tired but I feel good. Enjoyed the day even with rocks. I hear there are rocks for the next 20 miles. Joy.","Swatera Gap

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566518,"I didn't wake up as early as usual but I was still on the trail about 7:30am. I waved goodbye to Carl and took off. Lots of rocks already. I met 70 year old section hiker, Intrepid, who has been at it for 20 years. She has a great attitude. I was getting close to PA 183 when I met a fun couple, HongKongPhooey and Dori who are from Seattle but homeless while on the trail. They are SOBO and started in Bear Mtn State Park in NY. She mentioned the trail magic ice chest! There was tons of goodies in the ice chest! Usually it is empty when I find them. I grabbed a strawberry protein drink and walked to the road. As I was standing there a man pulled in. It was Craig from Rock n Sole Hostel. He was taking some more trail magic up the trail. He told me a little about his place and that he had a little trailer I could stay in by myself. He is a retired PA State Police officer and gave me a special price since I am retired Houston PD. Sweet. Then he invited me to church. YES. It was absolutely amazing. It was just called Bethesda Church. Wonderful people. Lesson on endurance from Hebrews 12.    Two other hikers also staying at the hostel, Craig and Trout, previously Halfway, joined us at church. Oh and I met Clarence who had appeared on two episodes of Naked and Afraid. Haha great show huh? Not. After church the Hostel owners son, Chase, dropped me off on the trail and I slack packed 14.8 miles. It took me 5 and a half hours. The rocks were brutal. I also went 200 brutal feet on rocks on a side trail to Sand Spring and got the best water on the entire trail. I needed water and it was worth it. I called Craig to let him know was about 20 minutes out but it took me about 30 because of the steep downhill, I mean straight down, climb off the mountain. I went super slow and was thankful I had hiker poles. Also the rain had started coming down pretty good about 5 pm and the rocks and mud were dangerous. Chase was waiting on me in Port Clinton. On the ride back to the Hostel he told me dinner was waiting on me. What? Another major surprise. Dinner and breakfast are included! I don't want this day to end. Best day ever! After a great dinner and dessert I took my outdoor shower and went off to my trailer. It has not stopped raining and the sound is perfect in the trailer. Going to sleep so well.","Hertline Campsite

I got a picture with Odie, talked a little and said my goodbyes. It was drizzly all morning and turned to rain by afternoon. I stopped for water and Train Wreck passed by. I met him the other day. He left Springer in March. I hiked with him a few minutes but he is too fast for me. Then a kid from Chicago with hiker name Chicago passed by also. I hiked all day in rain and didn't take many pictures. I made a dumb mistake and didn't pay attention to my guide book and passed the road to where I was supposed to turn for Eckville Shelter. I started going uphill and knew that was wrong. I sat down and ate dinner. Maybe I needed some sugar because I couldn't think very well. I decided to go back. It must have been over a mile but I was tired of the rain. I got to the shelter and Crazy Tree was here. He is a friend of Just Daves and began in Springer back on February 4th.

I just wasn't in the mood for rain so I plopped myself on a chair and planned to stay in the shelter all day if need be. The rain stopped at 9 and Crazy Tree took off. I was hungry again so I made another breakfast and left about 9:45. About a mile later a man came hiking up kind of fast behind me and I moved to let him pass. It was a man named Sparky who started Feb16 and is from Johnson City, TN. This is his second thru hike. He did it in 2011. We hiked together all day. Caught up to Crazy Tree and met Napala at Allentown hiking club shelter. We all hiked out together in hopes of stopping at Blue Mountain Summit restaurant that was 0.2 off the trail. It was closed when we arrived. Ohhhhhh not what a hiker wants to see! So sad. We sat there in the nice breeze for 30 minutes, had a snack, got water at the spigot and hiked on. It was just beautiful this afternoon. The rocks were crazy though. We hiked over PA's Knife Edge. It was amazing. We passed Bear Rocks but didn't climb up them. Just too tired. We passed Napala who found herself a little campsite. Me and Sparky decided to go back and join her while Crazy Tree continued to the shelter. The camp spot was sweet. We ate and talked then hung our food bags and had a brilliant sunset! Really just a great day today but my feet really are tender from the rocks. And they just plain stink!

I asked a man named John if he wouldn't mind to take 4 hikers to the trail. Thank you John, our awesome trailangel! Out of Palmerton is a major rock climb up. Very very beautiful. This area has been deforested due to zinc smelting and we have been told not to filter water near the this. Along the ridge I met Pollenmoon and her fiancé Pigpen who started the same day as me, May 16th, in Harpers Ferry. I also met Chefboyardee who started at Springer March 16th. Today had a bit of everything from nice trail to rocks. Mostly rocks. I had stopped aon the trail for a quick lunch and when I got up I felt something bite my thigh. It was a tick! Uck. I couldn't believe I actually felt that. I had to pull it out. I did get the head out. I put alcohol and neosporin on quickly. I did as much a tick check I could do right then and there. Hate those little monsters. I stopped at Leroy Smith Shelter for water. Whew what a hike down to the beautiful spring. I made dinner at the shelter and hiked out carrying extra water so I could stay at a stealth campsite. I thought Hahns Overlook might have one but it didn't. I went maybe 0.3 past and found Chefboyardee. He told me there was a site up on the ridge. I found Sparky there. Found a flat area in some grass but it is all rock underneath. I had a hard time setting up this tent. Went over and talked with Sparky. He gave me another homemade brownie and oatmeal cookie that a friend had made and had mailed to him in Palmerton. Today was an absolutely beautiful day. The weather was perfect. Hope to sleep well. I think I will go all the way to Delaware Water Gap tomorrow. It is 16.3 miles.

Watch out for them snakes Jarhead! I also met Mike and Kim who are from a hiking club from Korea and have been hiking the AT for 10 years. So many people out hiking today. Oh, yeah, it's Saturday. I totally enjoyed hiking into Delaware Water Gap. It is amazing. I arrived at Church on the Mountain Hiker Hostel at 3:30. It is a donation Hostel. I took a shower and a few of us had Kenny shuttle us to Walmart in Stroudsburg. Got back and went to Deer Head Inn for dinner and jazz! Fun, fun, fun. I set up my tent on the church yard.

I went inside where several men were in the bunk room or on the couches and quietly got my food bag. Made coffee outside. I called Kenny at 8 to get a ride to Stroudsburg but he was already busy. He gave me Jungle Jim's number and he came and picked up me and Sparky. We went to a laundromat and while our clothes were washing  went upstairs to an awesome restaurant with a North  Africa flair. Owner is from there. Delicious. Jungle Jim joined us. When our clothes were dry he drove us to the Pocono Church of Christ. Great lesson from Galations 5. We were invited to stay for a luncheon! Candy was our trail angel and drove us back to Delaware Water Gap and dropped us at Edge of the Woods Outfitters where I got some Injinji socks to test. Got back to the Hiker Center, packed, and was on trail at 2 pm. 20 minutes later we crossed into New Jersey! The rain had already been coming down before we even got on the trail. New Jersey is beautiful also. I stopped at the privy at Douglas campsite. Nice to get out of the rain for this. Sparky hiked on and I hiked alone the rest of the day. Sunfish Pond was a sweet surprise. Watched as a beaver swam near the side but it went under when I tried to take a picture. The rain stopped just before I got to the top of Kittatinny Mountain. The pictures just do not do this justice. The clouds were breathtaking! I had to pry myself off the mountain. I was in a Thomas Kincaid painting. Just me by myself up here and a bunny that wasn't afraid of me at all. I wasn't going to make it to the Mohican Outdoor Center before it closed so I had called to let them know I was on my way and wanted a bunk. I called back 30 minutes later and cancelled because it is just too awesome not to stay in my tent. Why pay $34.50 to bunk in snore fest room. Oh found a sweet spot by the creek all by myself.

Got to Catfish Tower at 9:30 and took a 45 minute break. It was very very foggy today but eerily beautiful. Saw Splint and Mike with his dog Charlie. Saw my first bear at 11 am! The high view today was up at 1557' in elevation. Not real high but the rock ledges were really amazing. New Jersey has totally surprised me so far. There is a huge threat of rain all night and since my feet needed  some TLC I stopped at Brink Shelter for the night. I took a bit of a bath down at the lovely spring. Made a great dinner from a lady who left her homemade dehydrated food in the hiker box at the hiker center. At the shelter were Breeze, Rocksteady, Linda and Pete with dog Scout, Joker, Sierra Mist, Sleepy Bear, and Splint.  Sierra Mist has a little guitar with her and she sings beautifully. I sat up in the shelter but changed my mind because I know myself well and will not be able to sleep with any snoring.

Took everything in to the shelter at 6. Me and Joker packed up and hiked out together to go to Gyp's Tavern. They open at 11am. He started in March from Springer Mtn. He has been off the trail with shin splints. He lives here in NJ. We got to the road at 10 and found the fisherman store open. Stayed in out of the cold, cold rain looking at fishing gear. Went to the Tavern and, oh, the Tavern was wonderful. Kristin was the only staff on hand. Waitress, chef, busboy. She took care of us all. My beer and burger was fantastic and I got a pizza to go. While there Splint had contacted Mosey's Place and got the last bunk. I called her and she said I can stay on the futon.She picked us up and on the ride home I finally recognized her! WOW! She hiked her thru hike in 2015 and I slept right next to her in my very first ever shelter in the Smokies. Even got a picture with her. This is soooooo cool. I wrote about her in my 2015 journal. So happy to be at her place. Lots of us here tonight. Splint, Jack, Bonanza, Brutus, Perette, Ringer, Forty Four, and Lobo. We called in a huge Chinese food order for pick up. They were overwhelmed but got the order correct. Planning to slack pack South tomorrow!

I slackpacked South back to US 206 for 14 miles. Splint caught up to me when I took a break at Mashipacong Shelter. Then Brutus showed up. We found water in the bear box. That was nice. We all arrived around the same time at Sunrise Mountain. Elevation was 1653' and a a nice view. Brutus and I hiked together and reached Culver Fire Tower. We climbed up the tower but Splint continued on. I really enjoyed the conversation with Brutus on the rest of the way to Gyp's Tavern. Brutus didn't stay for lunch so I said my goodbyes and hope to see him again. He is going SOBO. I called Mosey and she picked me and Splint up at 5 pm. They dropped me off at the headquarters with my pack now and I hiked on north. Splint went back to Mosey's. During today's hike I met a mom and daughter, Wistful and Relentless, who are from Austin. Mosey said they are at her place tonight. I hope to see them again and get to know them some. When I was dropped off I got to a wooden tower and saw High Point Monument from a distance. I took the steep 0.3 side trail to the 220' high monument. It was awesome but not open to climb inside. It is the highest point in NJ. When I left there I was really tired and went about 0.2 or so past High Point Shelter and found a lovely creek and sat up my tent. It was 7 pm and I just ate leftover pizza not wanting to cook.

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567934,"What a great day. The birds woke me up before 5 so I was on the trail about 6:20. I slept great. The miles went by really quick. I past a cute pond and was in Unionville, NY before I knew it. I arrived at Horler's store at 9:45 am and resupplied. Had a breakfast sandwich and was almost finished when Walter, Flick and Crazy Tree showed up. I packed up and was off before 11. The trail went through Wallkill Reserve. It was amazing. The birds are beautiful especially the Red Winged Blackbird. It is very popular with the locals and I can see why. I had met Nutty Butter yesterday and today he saw me as I passed Pochuck Mtn Shelter. What a nut. He rambled on for I don't know how long as I went up and over several mountains. I couldn't shake him. It was truly a one sided conversation. At County Rd 17 he went to a hot dog stand and I lost him! I continued across the street and the trail became a boardwalk over the swamp. I loved it. Near the end is an awesome suspension bridge over Pochuck Creek. The trail crosses a cow pasture with cows in it before coming to NJ 94. I saw a sign for food. It was 5:30 pm so I went for a deli sandwich at the Heaven Hill Farm. All organic! It was really a garden center but also had some groceries. Oh, Nutty Butty showed up and spoiled it. He took off so I took longer than I wanted to so I could put space between us. The next section was up a mountain and is known as 'stairway to heaven'. I hiked up this mountain with Flick and Walter who now has a trail name, Shepherd, because he was herding the cows! I take some credit for his trail name. It also has a double meaning for him because he has joined the Air Force and will be at Shepherd Air Force Base in Whichita Falls TX. We got down to the stream and got water. I hiked on and found a super stealth campsite going up the next mountain before the shelter. Today I put in more miles than I ever have. 22 miles in one day!

Stopped at the creek past the shelter and washed stinky socks and shirt. Going on I ran into Fourty Four. We talked a bit as Bee passed by us. At 8:45am I heard the strangest sound in the woods. I thought it was a donkey but no, maybe a goose. Or could it be a hurt bear? Do they make a wired honking sound? It was close and kind of scary. I have to check that out later. Hiked on and English Detective caught me. He started Feb 9th. Arrived at the NJ-NY border and sat, took off my shoes, and celebrated with an apple and almond butter with maple syrup in it. I had no idea NY was this beautiful. Got to Prospect Rock and a found a flag up there and amazing views of Greenwood Lake. It is the highest point on the AT in NY. Then came what is known as The Ladder. Lots of rocks and felt a little like Maine with the rebar in the rocks. I met a lady name Dis sitting on the rocks. She warned me about several rattlesnakes. As we talked we found something other than hiking in common. She was military police in the army and police officer in Fort Knox and then Fort Hood. I caught up with Forty Four and we looked for the snakes but never saw them. I was looking forward to Bellvale Farms Creamery so I hiked on quickly. Got to the road and walked 0.3 miles to the best root beer float I have ever had. A bunch of us hikers here all lounging around. It was hard to get going again. I lingered for two hours but I did get to charge my phone at the hiker charging center. I took off about 4:30 and got water at Fitzgerald Falls. I took extra up the mountain and found a sweet stealth spot just before 7pm. Made stroganoff and crashed.","Stealth Campsite AT mile 1359.6

Red Beard and Old English flew past me not wanting to talk but I got their names. Had some drizzle but just for a minute. Little Dam Lake is so pretty. Got to a campsite and found a box on the tree. Trail magic with first aid supplies. How nice. As I was sitting there, Squire and his sons, Stretch and Remix joined me. I hiked and met James, who is from London dayhiking with Han who is from Vietnam. We talked as we climbed down the huge rocks just before NY 17. At that road was a huge charter bus that comes from NY City and drops folks off to hike the AT. Lots and lots of folks out on this Saturday.  Emma, from Maine, asked if this was the AT as we were standing right by a blaze. Reminded me of me when I first started. I had no idea what a blaze was! . I hiked part way up the mountain and just had to stop and eat. This section is Harriman State Park so lots of people were going up the hill passing by me as I ate. The next section is the Lemon Squeezer. It is a small space with two huge boulders and the trail goes right through it. Flick and Shepherd had to take their packs off. I had no problem with mine. The trail goes up from here to Fingerboard Shelter. I stopped at the top before the shelter. It is so very pretty up here with all the mountain laurels blooming. The rain has held off all day but the clouds make for nice pictures. As I was going down there was a long line of people going south. They are from the Appalachian Trail Club. I think that's what they said. They gave me a bunch of trail bars and gummy candy! So sweet. I didn't take names but when you all read my journal, thank you so much! I posted your pictures. I got to Brien Memorial Shelter and got water out of a well. It was sulfur water but that's the only water source. I decided to hike a little more because there were too many people here including Nutty Buddy. I hiked a mile and found a better water source. Decided to stay here and found a wonderful grassy flat spot. It is very warm tonight. Today was a hard day for me with the heat and all the ups and downs. Going to nero tomorrow. Maybe even zero.

I started out at 6am and went straight up Black Mountain to the awesome view of the NYC Skyline way, way off in the distance. You can see it in the picture if you zoom in. I got to the Palisades Parkway and walked 0.4W to the visitor center. It was only 7 am and it was closed. I was just hoping for a vending machine and bathroom. Oh well, I threw trash away. Back to the trail and up West Mountain where I had nice views if the Hudson River at 1221' elevation. I also took a picture of Perkins Memorial Tower from this side knowing I would be going right to it. Next was Bear Mountain. I loved it up there. Got a Gatorade from a vending machine but the machine didn't give me my Pringles. Will call about that. I went up in the tower for great views. Lots of people here. It was a serious 2 mile hike down and tons of rock stairs. I just couldn't believe how many people were hiking up in the 90 degree heat. I finally arrived to the recreation area at Hessian Lake and it looked like 4th of July. Hundreds of people out barbecuing. The smells were overwhelming. I went to the restaurant upstairs for a great burger with arugula on it. I called Bear Mountain Bridge Motel and Doug picked me up. I got a great little room and Ingrid washed my clothes in her basement. I tried calling churches for two days and left many messages but did not get any return calls. This is my first Sunday not going to church on my hike. I did listen to Ultimate Gospel from Elvis this morning though.

We went over the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge. So very cool! The Bounders were hiking south on the bridge. Arrived at US 9 and stopped at the 24 Appalachian Market.

While there I met Hats. He hiked on and when I arrived at RPH Shelter he was sitting in a chair outside. Looked like he lived there. Funny. Joker caught up to me here. We hiked on together and when we got to NY 52 I went east to the store while he went west to the post office. Had a great lunch at the deli. Joker showed up but had a ride back to the trail by Dis. The car was full but I wanted ice cream anyway. I walked back the 0.4 miles to the trail and the weather was changing fast. I hiked faster and when I got up to Mt Egbert at 1329' elevation I could see and really hear the storm. I got to the shelter in time to get water before the skies dumped on us. Several of us were in the shelter very thankful because the hail came with the storm. It came down for a while and when it let up several hikers took off. The second round came down thirty minutes later even harder. I waited about an hour and went ahead and set up my tent. There are way too many people here tonight. So noisy. On a side note there is a couple here hiking with a cat. It is kind of cool. They are in a tent. The cat seems to love it. I added pics of the cat to photo list.

I have not seen the others I met yesterday. I stopped at Mt Algo Shelter for a break and found the cleanest and cutest privy yet on the entire trail. Leaving the shelter I found the road to Kent was only .3 miles but I had to walk 0.8 to the city. I wasn't planning to stop but the tortillas I had were stale so I went to town. Cute town. I ate breakfast at The Villager and just bought a couple of extra corn tortillas from the restaurant so I didn't stop at a store. I was back on the trail by 10:30. I also walked back. Today was harder than yesterday's terrain. The challenge of the day was the very steep stone steps down to the Housatonic River from St. John's Ledges. I had my sandals on already because my pinky toes were just killing me today so the steps down were even harder. Down at the bottom was a gravel road walk so I had to put my shoes back on since sandals just don't work for me on any roads. A lady named Sally stopped and talked and told me she was going to check on the eagle so I joined her. The nats are terrible and Sally didn't have a bug net for head. They're driving me crazy even with me headband covering my ears and my net on. We hiked a couple of miles on the trail and talked and then she pointed out the eagle with its nest.  Very cool. She went back and I hiked just a little  more and decided to jump in the river. Awwww. Good decision. Washed my clothes and my stinky self. I went about 3 more miles looking for a flat campsite. Well it was difficult but I managed. I think I found a spring. Not much water but it is cold and delicious. I heard a loud noise not far away and I think I caught a glance at the behind of a bear running away. Did a good job hanging that food bag and smelly stuff just in case. Oh and today I felt the bite of the tiniest tic I have ever seen in my life! Ugh. Self tic checks are so difficult. It is warmer tonight but still a slight breeze. Keeping my tent doors open tonight.

There were lots of ups and downs all day and I had to hike in my sandals for most of it due to painful left pinky toe. I hardly saw anyone at all today.

I was up Becket Mountain 2180' then Walling Mountain at 2215' in no time and down to a gravel road and took my first break. While at the road I was met by 
Bambi Magnet who is from Finland. He is hiking super fast and started May 7th at Springer Mountain. Wow! As I hiked on I counted at least 7 piles of bear scat in about a one mile area just before Washington Mountain Rd. Same bear? Or was it a herd? Yikes. I walked over to where the cookie lady lives but the place looked deserted except for the eggs for sale in an ice chest. When I got to Blotz Road I ran in to Rob the Trail Angel with the Casper van again. His nephew was not with him this time. He loves doing this trail magic thing. We talked some about what to do in Dalton. Great information. I hiked on listening to the storm brewing. I met Gas who is finishing up his section of hiking the AT over 12 years. He just started Friday and plans to summit Katahdin this year. We had one more little blip of a mountain before getting down to Dalton. I got to Woods Road and heard someone behind me yell ""Ghosthiker"". It was Moose! I thought he was long in front of me. We walked to the Shamrock together where I already had a room. He was able to get one also. Then Gas showed up for a room. I took a shower and called Tom Lavardi who was going to an AT meeting. The town has agreed to have somewhat of a Trail Days in August. He picked me up and took me to Walmart. I resupplied and then Tom picked me back up after his meeting. Sweet man. I tried to give him money but he wouldn't take it. The trail passes in front of his house and he lets hikers tent in his yard. He has been doing this for 37 years. After putting my food away I walked across the street to Jacob's Pub and had the best pork chop I have ever had. Went back to my room, polished my nails, and crashed.","US 20 Mile 1550.1

I had a huge root beer float and the best turkey sandwich at Diane's Twist. A little deli shop right on the AT. I left there at 1:30pm and was at the sign to the shelter by 3:30 so I decided to go all the way up to Mount Greylock. It is the highest peak in MA and is a fairly steep climb. The hike up was breathtaking. I felt like I was in the Smokies! It started raining about 3:30 and it was mostly just drizzle but the fog was amazing. I arrived at the lodge about 5:30. It is so eerie and quiet. So happy it is a Thursday and rainy. I think these factors have kept tourist's away. There are just a few hikers here. Moose, Clover, Yogi, and Mountain Music. There is also a woman with her two kids and that is all. There are several empty rooms.  I got a private room. The showers are separate and the bathroom is at the end of the hall. The hiker bunk room has 6 bunk beds in it and only 4 hikers. Mountain Music had a couple of friends visiting from Vermont and I joined them. It was fun hearing his stories about the trail.

I went out for a walk around the war memorial. It is about 52 degrees out here. There was no view at all this morning. I made myself coffee in my room then sat in the great room and read. We could order breakfast at 8 am. I left the lodge at 9:30 am. There is a big threat of rain today. The trail was straight down to the town of North Adams. I didn't go to town. I decided that I would just hike to the first shelter out of town due to the coming storm. I was passed up by the twin brother and sister, Yogi and Clover. Then I caught up to them when they got to the MA-VT border. There is another hiker, Cory, out here today who is doing the Long Trail here in Vermont. Today is his first day. The AT and the LT are concurrent for 105 miles. Today wasn't too hard but there was one big climb up rock vomit. I don't think I ate enough today cause I have low energy. I feel great just very hungry. I got to the shelter and decided to set up my tent but leave my pack hanging in the shelter. I was going to stay in the shelter but I know well that I will not be able to sleep. I wasn't going to write this but the smell of Moose's feet stink very bad. I think he has a foot fungus. He couldn't believe that I wash my clothes and feet every single night. I can't imagine not washing your feet day after day and putting them in your sleeping bag! So down I went to a wonderful creek and washed my feet. Then I made some beef stroganoff and had Belvita cookies for dessert. I had a hard time finding a tree suitable to hang my food. There are weekenders out here that are not hanging their food so I moved away from them. I know, I know, I used to do that. I was just lucky back then. Qinti taught me how easy it is to be consistent with hanging it and I sleep much better too. I am a little concerned my bag isn't high enough. Say a little prayer.

I slept in...until 5:25am. The hanging food bags did fine, no bear. It rained all night but not real bad. My tent stayed completely dry. I talked with Cory and Bill this morning. Moose was gone early. Cory took off and me not far behind about 7 am. Very very muddy everywhere. I am actually okay about this since last year at this time it was 95 degrees and there was a drought in Maine. The sun came out about 11 am. The trail is very treacherous though. Had a very nice view of Bennington, Vermont from Harmon Hill. It was 1.4 miles down to the road crossing. Huge rocks and stone steps pretty much all the way down. Very very dangerous. It took me over an hour to go the distance. When I got to the road Steve, with his dog Jack, were doing trail magic! Beer, hostess cupcake, Gatorade, Mountain Dew, and an apple! Oh, and he took my hiker trash.  Sweet, very sweet. Thank you Steve so very much. When I left I went over a cute bridge and straight up the mountain. Not nearly as much mud as earlier and it was not climbing up rocks. I passed the sign for the first shelter at 4:20 pm so I continued on. I got extra water so I could camp up higher on the ridge line. I found a sweet spot up on Porcupine Ridge and set up my tent. I was inside it when the afternoon storm hit. Well I am happy it rained early because I had to move my tent due to a huge puddle forming right at the front corner outside the tent. I quickly moved to a higher spot in the same area. I hate when that happens. Reminded me of the flash flood in Maine when I didn't set up far enough away from the trail. When it rains hard the trails are usually small rivers. The rain passed and I had a small rainbow to look at. It is very pretty up here. I think the rain is finished for a couple of days. It is 60 degrees tonight and I love it. I had chicken and rice and my apple. I am still hungry but have to ration. I don't think I will be in Manchester Center until Tuesday. I think I am the only one on this entire mountain.

It's super hard hard to eat enough. Today is turning out to be beautiful. The sun is out before 9am. I made it to Glastenbuty Mountain fire tower by 11 and took a lunch break up on the top.

Met a family camping at Story Spring Shelter. They have a big 4 person tent. Enjoyed visiting with you sweet family. Also here was a SOBO, Falstaf. I hiked on and reached a nice looking footbridge over a pretty stream and was just tired of hiking in the mud. I decided to camp here and met 2013 AT Thru Hiker Slownsteady and her husband Bear Bob. He caught a cute little Trout and I took a picture. They invited me over to join them to eat and then I got a wonderful homemade bean burrito because Slownsteady couldn't eat it all!

AT hikers have no idea who this man was. I love the fact that I did the Benton Mackaye back in April of this year. You can find that journal and pictures as well on this site. I met Rainman and Sundance on my way up. Sundance did the AT in 2009. On the top I could see why Benton Mackaye had the dream. Very inspiring.

I went to White Rocks Cliff and had lunch. It was a steep 0.2 miles down off trail so getting back on trail was tough. Going down the mountain from there I met section hikers, Steck on a Trek, and Action Jackson with Dogs Daisy and Duke. They just started a section today heading to Greylock. I enjoyed talking with them. I hiked on and went up Bear Mountain and down and light rain started. As I was going down I kept sliding on everything. Then it happened. I slid all the way to the ground. What is going on? Then I noticed the bottoms of my shoes are completely flat and smooth. No traction at all. Wow. How come I didn't notice it when I was in Manchester Center so I could get new shoes? Now I have to have a change of plans. I got down to VT 103 and was able to hitch a ride by the sweetest Trail Angel. Barbara gave me a ride all the way to Rutland and even came in to the Mountain Traveler Outfitters with me. They had my shoe but not my size. She then walked across the parking lot to the shoe store with me where I found some Salomon Trail runners! Barbara took my old shoes!

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573962,"So a man came in at 10 pm and sat up his tent on the platform 5 feet away from me. Since he made noise that late I'm sure he wanted to sleep in. Nope. I was up at 5 making my noise and on the trail at 6. The sunrise was amazing. Pictures just don't do it right. The hike down took me 2 hours and 20 minutes. I took my sweet time. When I arrived at the parking lot I found Squire with his boys ready to head north. Funny how I have been in their bubble for so long. Great little family.  I walked 0.5 to The Lost River Gorge store and waited until they opened at 9. They were 10 minutes late opening. People were waiting around. I just wanted food. I was there an hour so I could fully charge my phone. It is going to be great weather for several days and I am going to take advantage of it to get across the Whites. I will be super stinky when I get to Gorham. The first mountain I went up today was Mt Wolf at 3478 elevation. I was a little warn out after this mountain. I wanted to camp past Eliza Brook Shelter because it was only 3:30pm when I got there. I could not find a stealth campsite today. So I just kept going hoping something would come up before I went up South Kinsman. Nothing. Well, no I have to go over the mountain and it's already 6 pm! Not good planning on my part. The climb was challenging. I tied my hiking poles to my pack and just rock climbed the mile up. It was worth coming up kind of late in the day because the sky was so clear and beautiful. The elevation is 4358'. My second 4000er in two days. I found a sweet super stealth spot on South Kinsman just before going down.  I decided not to cook and ate a tuna wrap. Made sure I have no smells on me and hung my food bag even way up here at alpine. It is so cold I am using a hand warmer and sleeping in socks and my down jacket and hoodie for the first time on this hike. I can hear fireworks but can't see them. I think Lonesome Lake Hut are doing them. It is amazing up here and I hope to wake up super early and see the sun rise.","Beaver Brooke Shelter mile 1798.3

I watched the sun come up over Mt Lafayette! All I could think was today is the day that the Lord has made. Rejoice! And be glad in it. I was meant to be right here to see the sunrise. Then I hiked 3 miles to Lonesome Lake Hut. I arrive at 8 am after the 47 people staying here finished eating I got to load up on leftover pancakes, eggs, oatmeal, pineapples and coffee! It was amazing. I washed my clothes in the running water bathroom sink. I asked a nice lady if she wouldn't mind looking at a sore spot on my back. She ended up being a nurse! I have prickly heat rash. She told my just to try and keep it dry! I wish I could. I stayed about an hour at the hut and did a lovely easy hike down to Franconia Notch and then right back up another mountain. I met a nice man named John and we hiked up to Mt Liberty 4291' together. It is 0.3 off trail but well worth it. Then we hiked Little Haystack Mountain 4800', Mt Lincoln 5089', and Mt Lafayette 5291'. These are the most majestic mountains I have ever climbed. I enjoyed John's company all day. We found a little stealth campsite for two tents with plenty of space in between so I don't hear him moving around in his tent. The sunset was another gorgeous one.

Went over a small bump and straight up Mt Garfield 4509' elevation. Then a steep hike down and across the ridge. Arrived at Galehead Hut at 10:30am but they did not have leftover breakfast. I bought coffee and snacks and then the girl brought out last nights leftover Hungarian Mushroom Soup! I ate two bowls with two huge slices of French bread. We  were there about a hour or so. Again washed my clothes and took somewhat of a bath in the bathroom sink. When we left there we went up South Twin Mountain. I am out of words to describe it all. Went down to Mt Guyot then to Zeacliff Cliffs. This was one of my favorite places yet. Sat for a while and pondered it all. While on the cliff we could hear the thunder rolling. Put my shoes on and went down the mile to Zealand Falls Hut to wait it out. It just sprinkled a little. While at the hut one of the workers came out and brought a huge pot of mashed potatoes to us thru hikers waiting out the possible storm. What a treat! We ate and decided to hike out so I could take advantage of an easy area and get some mileage in. This is where John and I part ways. He is camping just past where the AT and the Zeacliff Trail split. We said our goodbyes and I hiked another 5 miles or so. I found another super awesome stealth spot at the stream about a mile north of Ethan Pond Campsites. It was Avery long day in the Whites today. I hope to wake up feeling good.

Got to Crawford Notch at 7:45am and started the climb up the first mountain. Was on top of Mt Webster at 10 am. Then I went across the ridge to Jackson. I saw a beautiful reddish American Pine Marten slinking across the rocks. Didn't get a picture of this one. It was exciting to see it though. Got up to Mt Jackson by noon and a man named George with his dog Frisbee, gave me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and some organic almonds! Trail magic on top of a mountain. The 1.3 miles to Mizpah Hut seemed a lot longer than it was. I had a leftover pancake and some oatmeal. I didn't stay long. I went straight up to Mt Pierce, then a long ridge walk over so many presidents. Mt Eisenhower was spectacular. Then I went over Mt Franklin and the AT just skirted Mt Monroe. Most of the while I was viewing the top of Mt Washington. I have not used my hiking poles at all in the Whites. I find it easier to scramble up or down without them.  I also have not slack packed this entire time! I finally saw the Lake of the Cloud Hut! Yay. I was the first thru hiker here to ask for work for stay. I am not staying in the dungeon, it is moldy and damp. 
Several thru hikers are staying in it but they have to pay $10.00 without getting food. My timing was so perfect. I know I probably won't get much sleep tonight but I will survive. This week couldn't have been any more perfect so far! He most difficult hiking I have ever done. But perfect in every way! So after we ate very well I had to break down boxes and help wash the last of the dishes with Slumber Land. Such a bonding experience huh. Now I am waiting for lights out at 9:30pm.

I arrived on Mt Washington, elevation 6288', at 7:30. It was amazing up here. Only me and Slumber Land. No tourists in sight. I didn't wait for the Summit House to open at 8 because I knew there was a storm coming. I hiked down and watched the first cog train coming up. It is so amazing hiking from Washington to Madison hut. I did this section last year going Southbound. NOBO is the better choice. I arrived at the hut at noon exactly. I was able to charge my phone while I had some coffee and leftover oatmeal. I was only there 30 minutes because I wanted to get up Madison,elev. 5366', before the storm hit. I did good. It started raining while I was already on top. So thankful there was zero thunder or lightning. The rain was light and I only used rain gear for 10 minutes. He hike down was tough. Super tough. It took me 3 1/2 hours to go from the hut to the Osgood Cutoff 3.7 miles. I was whooped. It was only 4.1 miles to Pinkham Notch. I thought it would be a couple hours or so. Not! I was exhausted. I had a hard time finding the north trail. The trails have all kinds of different names through here and there are no blazes. I needed a break so I went the steep 0.1 mile up to the top of Lowes Bald Spot and ate. I know I have not had enough food today. I sat and watched the cog train going up this side of the mountain and also the big black cloud going over. The rain had to have clobbered Mt Washington but I never got any. I got down to the Notch at 8pm and, sweet, sweet trail magic. A room. A single room to myself at Joe Dodge Lodge! I missed dinner but guess what? They warmed me a plate, had a big fat salad and dessert! I must be dreaming. I took a shower then ate an entire pint of Ben and Jerry's and totally crashed!","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

It was an all you can eat buffet style! I organized my stuff and went to the other building and bought an ice cream sandwich so I could use the vanilla ice cream to make a root beer float. Can you believe they didn't have any vanilla ice cream in a pint? So I finished that and was on the trail at 11am. It was a beautiful sunny morning with afternoon storms in the forecast. I took the most amazing picture of Mt Washington when I got to the Lost Pond. After that I started climbing up, up, up! While going up Wildcat Mountain Peak E a major thunderstorm hit. I'm talking serious thunder. Serious! The rain hit good and I just stayed put. I think I waited about an hour and the thunder was going away from me before I started going up again. The sky lightened up and I literally took off my shorts on the trail, rung them out, and put them back on. Same with my socks. The rocks are so wet. I am such an old ghost when it rains. I was still hiking up when all of the sudden a family comes walking down the trail at me. Weird. I asked where they hunkered down in that storm because they looked perfectly dry. They said they came up the gondola. One lady had on a halter top and red skirt with no shoes. People from New York right here on Wildcat! I wish I took their picture. The Wildcats have several peaks to them and are super hard and exhausting. The rain of course just makes it worse. Peak E is 4065', peak D, goes down a little at 3990' and this is the one with the gondola. Then there is peak C, 4274', and then peak A, 4422'. There isn't a B. During all of these I kept hiking up and listened to storms all around me. After peak A it was a very steep descent to Carter Notch Hut. I got down to the hut just before 6pm and guess what? I got a bunk! I had to pay for it but it was sweet. I sat like a guest with several others at a table for dinner. See picture. Janice even offered me some wine with my dinner! Trail magic.

This is the crazy huge boulders for over a mile on the AT. It took me 1 hour and fifty minutes. It is still cool like I remembered it to be. Ice down in the bottom of some of the boulders. My hands hurt when I was finished though. Next was a steep 1 1/2 mile climb, 1500 feet elevation gain, the Mahoosuc Arm. The weather was perfect for all of this rock climbing. Nice and cool too for this time of year. Going down wasn't bad and Speck Pond is beautiful. From here I went up Speck Mountain and took the 0.3 mile side trip to the observation tower. It was absolutely worth it. I remember my camera not working last year. It is a strange feeling going north this year compared to last year. It feels like I am rewinding. As I was going down to Grafton Notch a man named Bloodhound with his two bloodhound dogs, Caroline and Beau Diddley, were doing trail magic! A cold PBR, a strawberry, and a full size Hershey bar!

I went up South Crocker Mountain and didn't summit. Then North Crocker. On the way down I met a young couple who are both pharmacist's. We had a pretty good conversation going down the trail to ME 27. I decided to go into Stratton and get a shower, wash clothes, and eat and get back on trail since it was only 1:30pm. I got a ride quick from Luke and was in town exactly 4 hours. Sea Breeze and Switchback flagged down a man named Jonathan in a truck when I walked away. They told him I was with them and he pulled over for me too and brought us back to the trail. Was going up the hill at 5:30pm and feeling good. I skipped Cranberry Stream Campsite knowing there were several other hikers there and besides the mosquitoes were pretty bad. I went up to Bigelow Range Trail and went the 0.2 west to Cranberry Pond. I think I have been here before but can't quite recall. I got to the Pond and there is a sign saying no camping past the sign due to giardia. Glad I brought extra water with me. I walked back towards the trail away from the Pond and found a sweet spot that feels super familiar. I will have to look at my last years trail journal. I didn't do that ahead of time because I wanted to be surprised again and it's working. My memory is not that great. And going NOBO feels very different. I had a great day today and so happy with my decision not to stay in town. Stratton is not that cute of a town and the motel sure needs a vacuuming! Couldn't hang my food bag and as I was trying to get to sleep some kind of little critter was going up and down a tree. Hope it's not a fisher cat!","South Branch Carrabassett River

Beautiful with big boulders scattered and lots of green moss everywhere. I just love this part. It's a cold but beautiful day for the Bigelows. As I go up the big Bigelow I just don't know why I don't remember it. It is amazing! I hiked to Avery Peak and I do remember this spot. It is so clear today I think I see Katahdin from here. Next was a long but nice hike down just to go up some to Little Bigelow Mountain. It felt like Thur ridge up here went on forever! The hike down on this part was beautiful. I arrived at East Flagstaff Lake at 7:30 pm and set up my tent. Walked in the lake, ate food and hung the bag. It's 9 pm and the couple in a tent about 20 feet away are talking and laughing.

Was on trail at 6:30 thinking I might make it to the Kennebec River ferry crossing before the last ride across at 2 pm. The AT Conservancy pays for the canoe service across the river. It is the official route and they don't want hikers fording because the current is unpredictable. I was moving pretty good until the rain began about 9. Now everything is so slick. I decide I might just ford the dangerous river if I don't make it. I can't say much about the trail but it is fairly easy but constant very cold rain. I got to Pierce Pond Lean-to about 1pm and had almost 4 miles to go. I knew it wouldn't happen. I saw a sign that said Harrison's Pierce Pond Camps. What is that? I looked at my AWOL guide and saw the word pancakes. I tried to call but no cell service. I decided to go check it out. I met Tim Harrison and he gave me the scoop. Wow. What a find! Bed, shower, breakfast and I got a whole little cabin to myself! I have to use my sleeping bag but I do get two pillows with pillow cases. This is so wonderful and I get to snuggle on the couch in the great room with a cute miniature poodle named Charlie. Dinner is not included so I cooked at my cabin but as I was sitting in the great room Tim brought me his homemade chicken noodle soup. Delicious. Sleeping very well tonight!

I got pretty much the only place to set up a tent. Calves and Nails kept going and Rambo is the only one inside the shelter. He was going to hang his food in the shelter until I told him about the big poo. He didn't see it. Immram showed up about 7 but decided to hike on.

It could have been worse if they were ore active. They stung me through my socks and that may have helped also but they sure pack a punch. So many of the hikers are getting a food drop in the woods. They have to time it just right and a few are having to wait several hours to get it and then a few may not make it to the drop in time. Not sure how it all works.

I stopped at the Picosin Cabin and got water from the spring. Very nice source. Water is hard to find. I got to South River Picnic area at 4 pm and ate my first dinner then went up the mountain. I had walked across the road and up the hill and hoped to get water at the stream but there was none. I had to go back 0.3 miles to one of the park entrances to get water from the spigot. I filled up all my water bladders and lugged it up the hill and found a very nice stealth spot about 6:30pm. I made rice for dinner and had chocolate for dessert. It's 8:30pm now and I am going to bed. And I did find a good tree for hanging the food bag.","Big Meadows Lodge

I had a hard time falling asleep and then starting at 1:20am I woke up every hour. 2:20, 3:20, 4:20. Then when I went back to sleep at 4:20, Teri and I climbed Mt. Katahdin! That was an amazing dream but it is still exhausting even in a dream to climb THAT mountain. I woke up at 6 and it was pitch black. I went ahead and got my food bag and made coffee. I began hiking at 7:30am. I don't know what the name of the mountain I was going up when I ran into Pitch Perfect. I had met her on June 14th when I was waiting to catch the taxi to Pawling to get to the train for NYC! So long ago. She said she got to Gorham, NH and was freezing all the time so she flipped down to Harpers Ferry on September 5th. We talked a little and took a picture together and I hiked on. I arrived at Pinefield Hut at 1:30pm and had lunch and got some water but it clogged up my filter. Will clean it when I get to the wayside. The terrain has really changed compared to the northern section of Shenandoah. I like this part better. It's more rugged and just beautiful. It is a little more mountainous feeling. I took the Ivy Creek Spring Trail to the Loft Mountain Wayside and arrived at 3:30pm. Had a turkey sandwich with French fries and a Mountain Dew and was back on the trail at 5. I passed Grandpa out here. I had met him somewhere in Vermont. He is hiking SOBO. I got near the Loft Campground and went to the bathroom and filled up water so I could stealth somewhere. Well, somewhere ended up being a ways off and I had to hike with my headlamp for about an hour. I am somewhere just north of Doyle's River Overlook. Found a spot probably too close to the trail about 8:15pm. Had a snack and hug the food bag. The bugs are super noisy out here. I think it's the cicadas but I'm not sure. I guess I will listen to music to drown them out. Hope I sleep better than last night.","Stealth 1283.2

Went down the long 0.2 mikes to Blackrock Hut to get water. The next source is about 13 miles ahead. Have to lug extra. Talked with a man named Dave who mentioned the small Stream is not a reliable source. He was there yesterday and said it was minimal water. It is so hot today and is suppose to go up to 85 degrees. Lots of ups and downs today with not a whole lot of views. I slowed down and decided to just get to Waynsboro tomorrow. Met a hiker named Mystical who was a flip flopper initially but it hurt before NH and went home, recovered and hiked in the south going north. I liked her and she was about my age. Hard to find a compatible female to hike with. To bad she's going north. When I got up high on a mountain I got cell reception and I was able to make a reservation at Ernies house.

Just Mary is a journalist and did a short interview with me and took my picture with her big Nikon camera. She is writing an article for a paper and will send me some more questions and a link to the article when finished! She is hiking with her friend Lucy.  Collectively they are called Two Ghosts! We talked while hiking for a bit, but I had to stop for a nature call. They hike fast and kept going. Made it to Rockfish Gap at 11:30 and of course got a hot dog with sauerkraut from the popcorn stand! Mary and Lucy were here when I arrived and got a quick hitch to Waynesboro. I went in with Mark and Grandpa. They took me to the Walmart and went to eat and came and got me and took me to the library. I walked to the YMCA to wash my hands and the lady told me I could have a free shower! Yes I did. Just had to leave my drivers license to get a towel. I got a message from Ernie who told me where to find the key. He has an air B&B and I am staying at tonight. I walked about 4 short blocks to his house and he arrived 30 minutes later. Great place. The house is over 100 years old and he has the entire upstairs set up for guests. We sat in the backyard and talked while I soaked my feet in a lively epsom salt bath.

He did a slack pack today. Why didn't I think of that? It was a long but not too rough hike up to Humpback. Water is very hard to find though and I went 0.3 to the Humpback picnic area one way for water. I got close to Cedar Cliffs and there is a no camping sign. I went ahead and sat and watched the sunset! My son called while I was up there. So nice to hear from him. It got dark fast so I knew I would be hiking in the dark.

I told him to pray for God's will in my life and he prayed with me right then and there! So amazing. He was so humble. Thank you Michael.

I was up for about an hour and I guess playing on the internet didn't help but I was trying to figure out where I could get a shower and wash clothes. I am really stinking lately. It seems after I had gotten in the Tye River my skin has a strange smell. I wonder if there was bacteria in that river. I don't have any rashes or anything, just stink. Was able to go back to sleep until 7am! So I will spend one more night tonight in my tent and get to Glasgow early tomorrow. I talked to Adam at Stanimals this morning about getting a ride. Hope it will work out. Finally on trail at 9:10am but knowing I am only doing about 15 today. Downhill to the road with slippery little gravel. Not my favorite. Got to the road and met Obsidian who started in Harpers Ferry and is SOBO to Springer. She said she is only going to the first shelter today. What? It's 1.8 miles. Hmm hope she has a good book. Met TNC doing another north slackpack at 11:45 am. So pretty today hiking along the Brown River. There was once a community out here. I can see why. Got to the Cascades hoping for water. There is a smidgeon of a trickle but no small pool for me to filter. Next water, I will be praying, is 3 miles ahead. There was water! So I filled everything and had to carry it 5.1 miles to get to the top of Bluff Mountain at 3323' elevation. My altimeter shows me camping at 3429' elevation. This was another super hot ending to the day. It was 82 degrees today and that slowed me down. I have been soaked in sweat. Got to the top of the mountain at 7 pm. Breathtaking up here.

I forgot to mention the room I am in is in a mobile home. It's very cute. I baked a lemon cake here in the kitchen. Yum! Chris and What A Load went to pick up some hikers and on the way dropped me and Red Beard off at Walmart.  I connected with a man named Doug, and his wife Laurene. I had met him the day before on the trail and we talked about Lyme Disease. I was so happy I got to meet her too here at Walmart. We talked a lot about it. I hope you two keep in touch with me. It was so nice talking to you. Back at the hostel I made some dinner and shared it with RedBeard. It is suppose to rain for the next four days or so but I will be hiking out in it tomorrow. We need the rain even if it is no fun to hike in. Can't wait until Tuesday. Going to bed about 9:30pm. I feel well rested.","

On the trail and just very light rain but beautiful puffy white low hanging clouds. First climb was up to Angels Rest and the view was amazing. I was up on the ridge line most of the morning. Met Tornado who will be finished when he gets to Roanoke area! It must feel good. I got to Sugar Run Gap about 2 pm and almost thought about going to Woods Hole Hostel but made myself continue on. There still wasn't any rain but the views were now socked in with the low clouds and fog. I passed two men and then saw Detour. It is his dad and brother out hiking with him and Ishmael for a few days. There are a lot of section hikers out hiking north. I met a man with a Vizsla named Little Ann. Cute dog. I arrived at Wapiti Shelter at 6 pm and there is nobody here. It is suppose to rain all night beginning about 8 pm. The wind is picking up. I ate pizza for dinner and a tortilla with peanut butter for dessert. Was still hungry and had some Belvita breakfast cookies also. I got a great picture after watching a big fat frog eat an inchworm! Yum. He looked happy. Hung my food bag but double bagged it in my Zpacks food bags knowing it will be hanging in rain all night. I have never had food in my bag get wet. I've never slept in a shelter alone. I feel more vulnerable in the shelter then I do my tent for some odd reason. I hope I sleep okay.

It rained very hard all night. So very thankful I was in this shelter. I had it all to myself all night so I took up all the space and slept at the back sideways because the rain mist was coming in at the front. I made the mistake of hanging my down jacket on a hook. It took in a lot of moisture. I ate pizza and had coffee and took my time getting on the trail. I got out at 8:30am. No rain just high humidity and water falling off trees. I skipped going the 0.3 miles one way to Dismal Falls. I have a great memory of going there with Just Dave in 2015. Instead I went the 0.5 miles one way to Trent's Grocery. I arrived at 12:30 and met Albert the store owners dad who told me about the murders of the two hikers over 30 years ago at Wapiti Shelter. Any connection to my strange uncomfortable feelings I had there last night? It was creepy. I had a big cheeseburger and fries and a fried cherry pie and hiked on at 2pm. I got to Jenny Knob Shelter about 6 pm. Two guys who I met at Four Pines were here. I think their names are Jose and Kelly. Also here is Sherry, a firefighter from Orlando area out hiking for a week. They all put their backpacks with their food on top of the shelter. I've never seen that before. The roof is low in the back and I think a bear can get up it. I ate some pizza and donuts and hung my food bag. This was the highest branch I have ever been able to throw a rock bag over. It did take three times but go me.

No rain this morning! I have 11 miles to get to Bland. Took a long break at the halfway point or so and Kelly and Jose caught up to me. Talked with Kelly until they got to their destination shelter for the day and I hiked on. I arrived at US 52 at 3 pm and found a restaurant! Yay. Called Dave to let him know where I am and got a burger and fries and a Mountain Dew. He got a bit lost and finally found me about 5:00 pm.

Dave brought me back to Bland and I was hiking by 10 am. Plans didn't work out for Gracie to hike a couple of days but we did some day hikes in Grayson Highlands. Had a lot of fun. Now I have some catching up to do. I hiked pretty fast for the first 6 miles or so. I got to Jenkins Shelter about 3 pm and found Mrs. Joy there. She was thinking about staying there due to big rain coming tonight. I ate a late lunch and decided to hike on. It seemed like I was going uphill most of the day. It wasn't too hot today but I needed a lot of water. I was going to camp tonight but there is just no water. The streams and springs are completely dry. There are some beautiful places to camp but since there is no water I called Saint Luke's Hostel. And of course, the big chance of rain being 100 percent. Hostel owner Mark picked me up and I could see the Hostel on the ride down the mountain. It is amazing. It is an old farmhouse over 100 years old on 100 plus acres. I have a room in the house to myself. No other hikers are here. Had an amazing dinner of lamb, roast pork, sweet potatoes, little white potatoes, green beans and rice!

My backpack was in the way of the view so I was able to see him and yelled for him to stop. He had quickly turned around. He is a thru SOBO hiker. He stayed at the shelter with Mrs. Joy and said it rained for several hours last night. Everything is very slick. Got to Chestnut Knob Shelter at 1:30pm and made some warm mashed potatoes and a coffee to warm up. Thought about staying but it is just too early to stop for the day. I hiked on still bundled up and about 4 pm I could take my outer layers off. The sun came out and it was beautiful. I called Mack at Appalachian Dream Hiker Hostel while up on the ridge at 5:30pm. I had 4.3 miles to go and he would pick me up at 7:30pm. Got to Knot Maul Branch Shelter and Mudflap was there for the night. I told him I was going to the hostel. He had read in the log book about the hostel so he packed up to go down the mountain. I got down to the parking lot at 7:15 and Mack was waiting. We waited 10 minutes or so and Mudflap arrived. The hostel is a sweet place indeed. Mack made us homemade vegetable soup and chile and pimento cheese sandwiches. I was so stuffed I turned down the apple pie for dessert.

Remembered it as soon as I walked up the hill. Then I talked briefly with Bushwacker who is out for 10 days. The weather is perfect today. Still a little chilly but there is just a little wind so it's not as chilly. Past the sign for the 1/4 Way Point. I say it is the 3/4th Way Point! I got down to Interstate 81 at 3pm and went to The Barn for a cheeseburger and fries. I got a surprise while in the restaurant. A trucker I briefly talked to paid for my food! Wow. Thank you to him. I don't have a name. That was trail magic! I stayed there until 4:15 pm and then hiked out. The trucker was still out there in his truck and I am guessing he may have wanted me to go by and say thank but I was a little bit uncomfortable that he was still around. I hiked on quickly and went another 5 miles before I thought about finding a camp site. I made it to Chatfield Shelter by 6pm. I had looked hard for a stealth spot but could not find anything. As I got closer to the shelter I heard a funny voice singing. It was a man named Chipmunk. He has his little tent set up on the far side inside the shelter. He didn't talk much, just hello and told me his name and asked me mine and went to bed. I sat my tent up by the fire pit in front of the shelter.

I called for the transit and they will be at Mount Rogers Visitor Center at 2 pm to take me to Marion. When I stopped I noticed I lost my coffee cup. So sad this is. It was one of my most loved and used items. I got to the center at 11:30am. What to do while I wait? A sponge bath and wash clothes of course. Chipmunk showed up. He was using the wall phone to try to make a dental cleaning in Marion. Hmmm. He is a character. He couldn't get an appointment last minute so he went to the Partnership Shelter for the night. He is only hiking to Damascus. I'm sure his 6 teeth can wait. His words, not mine. The man at the center told me about Jim who does shuttles. I called him and he showed up about 1pm. He was wonderful. His son Spark did the AT in 2014. Took me to Walmart and waited for me, I forgot a water so I ran in Ingles real quick, then Subway, and back to the trail by 2:15pm!

There were 3 ponies in the corral and a camping trailer and an SUV in there also. I hiked on and ShooBear ran up the mountain to catch me. He was huffing and puffing. I wanted him to go on so I paused a while. There are lots of wild ponies up here on the Highlands and I still have several miles to go before Grayson Highlands.

When I told him my name ha said he met a Ghostwalker going north and got her name due to her big poncho and looking like a ghost in the clouds. Hmmm? I think it was me. I got on trail by 8am. Was down at Hughes Gap by 10:40am and going up the last little hump of the day, Little Rock Knob. So far no rain. There were just light sprinkles when I first left the shelter. Mary Poppins and Rare passed me as I was going the knob. It got cold again as I went up and I had to put my down on. Then on the other side I got hot again. All day long, hot, cold, hot, cold. Then the sprinkles started again. I just used my umbrella. Arrived at Greasy Creek Gap at 1:15pm and went the 0.6 miles down to Greasy Creek Friendly. It’s a long walk down but I liked staying there in 2015 so I went again. Arrived by 1:30pn. I like Connie and I also wanted to be inside because there will freezing rain all weekend. Mary Poppins,Rare, and another hiker named Mooskie are here. I took a shower and had a hamburger. Watched a movie and soaked my feet in epsom salt. Connie took a the others to pick up their orders at the grill but I am tired of overeating. I had a small salad and bought a Ben and Jerry’s pistachio ice cream and only ate some of it. There is a leak in the room by my bed and a bucket to catch the water. It will bother me all night. It has rained hard for hours and has gotten colder. Tomorrow will be even colder. So happy to be in even with the leak. Bed for me at 8pm. Goodnight.","Roan High Knob Shelter

I waited until the sun was out for a while and got hiking at 11am. It was hard finding the trail back from Greasy Creek Friendly. Mary Poppins and Rare had left early and they also made a huge arrow in the snow pointing to the trail at a sharp turn. Thank you to them. There is a lot of snow up on Iron Mountain and I almost thought about going back. Glad I didn’t because the snow is disappearing quick. Had to take off long johns by noon. So happy to have an umbrella for another reason. Snow falling off the trees hurts. It really is beautiful today but I hope my toes don’t get frostbite. I got to Cherry Gap Shelter at 3 pm and made a tuna wrap for lunch. Mooskie arrived and planned to stay. I changed my socks and put umbrella bags over the dry socks and put my thicker wool socks back on over the bags. This worked great. I hiked up Unaka Mountain and my toes were not freezing. Just a little cold. There was a lot of snow up on that mountain at 5183’ elevation. I hiked fast and got to Beauty Spot at 6:20 pm and watched the most amazing sunset. There were about 6 other people up there. It is so windy up there I kept hiking hoping to go down where the wind would be blocked to set up my tent but it got worse and more snow on the ground so I went back up to Beauty Spot and sat up my tent where there was no snow. I can see the lights of Erwin up here. The stars are amazing and the moon is bright. It’s cold and windy but gorgeous. I think it will get down to 36 tonight.

It was so strong I thought my tent was going to rip. I got up at 6am and got out to pee. Oh, man, that was hard. It is freezing cold wind. I felt like I was going to blow away. The sun was coming up and so dark orange but before it came over the mountain, the Bald was instantly socked in. Big fog and mist all over my tent. I made biscuits and gravy and coffee and hurried to pack up. I slept in all my clothes and put my shoes and socks from yesterday in my sleeping bag with me. Good decision. I even put my shoes on in my tent. Got on trail at 8 am. Wish I would have kept going last night because within 20 minutes I found a nice campsite with very little wind. The fog has blown off quickly and I warmed up fast. It is going to be beautiful today. Stopped at Curley Maple Gap where there is an old house foundation and had lunch. The hike down went fast and the last mile to Erwin is beautiful. Got to Uncle Johnny’s at 1:30. Washed up in the bathroom and had a big lunch. Bought of few resupply items. One hour break and back on the trail at 2:30pm. Straight uphill with amazing views of the Nolichucky River.  I arrived at No Business Knob Shelter at 5:30pm and decided to stay here. There is no one else here. It is so quiet except for a couple of loud owls and I am so happy there is no wind. I sat up my tent and found a tree to hang my food.

I could hear the critters scampering about and kept thinking they are climbing my slick skinny rope to my food bag. From now on, earplugs. I got up just before 6 am. My food bag was fine. I tried a new breakfast food. Mountain House Breakfast Hash. I don’t think I will get it again. It’s okay just a little too spicy for me. Packed and hiked out at 7:15am with my headlamp on.  Got to a lovely water source in 5 minutes and took my time getting water. Was able to put the headlamp away. As I went up the hill and watched the bright orange light coming over the mountain, I had a big smile on my face. I NEVER get tired of it! Pictures don’t do it justice. You must come see this for yourself. It has been so quiet today and even yesterday. No hikers. Finally going up Little Bald I saw one hiker. Smoky is hiking north to Virginia. I got up to Big Bald at 2:30pm. It is a 360 degree view up there at 5516’ elevation. I hiked down out of the wind and stopped right on the trail and made some potatoes. I was so hungry for warm savory food. I had five miles to go and needed the carbs. I got to Sam’s Gap and called Natures Inn Hostel for a pickup. I rented a creekside cabin but when Taft picked me up he said I was the only one there and gave me the whole house for the same price. Awesome, awesome, awesome!

It takes a while to get packed up when everything is so damp. I made coffee and a burrito and had a delicious muffin provided my my neighbor, Vickie. Thank you Vickie! Packed and hit the trail at 8:15am. The fog cleared out about 9 am. I feel like I don’t have much to write about today. I went up Big Butt Mountain and there wasn’t much view. I got to Jerry’s Cabin Shelter and there were 5 women there. 4 are hiking together for several days going south and the other is hiking north by herself. There is s sign at this shelter showing 300.3 miles! I hiked 5 more miles since it was only 2:30pm. Beautiful scenery here. Lots of rocks though. Whiterock Cliff View was gorgeous. I found a stealth little spot near a bigger campsite. No one here but me. There is an amazing spring here. I made spaghetti and potatoes for dinner. Sat down at the spring and soaked my tired feet in the cold water. I miss my SpeedCross4 shoes. These GoreTex UltraX Salomon’s are stiff.

I hiked fast all day in light sprinkles. I put rain gear on for a little while but just got too hot and took it off for good. Finally got to Lovers Leap and could see the French Broad River but there were too many people and I just wanted to make it to the outfitters in Hot Springs before they closed at 5pm and it was 4:15pm already. While going down the hill I slipped and landed flat on my back. My pack completely saved me. I was not hurt at all but it could have been bad since it was a huge wood block step that I slipped on. Be careful would you, I tell myself. I made it about 4:30pm and got some Mountain House resupply. Then went across the street to the Spring Creek Tavern and had a burger and fries. Got a room at Iron Horse Station and finally a shower. I had to walk to the tobacco store for change to wash clothes so I went to the Dollar Store while I was out. There was no laundry soap at the laundromat so I put a few drops of camp soap in the machine. I am tired and my ankle is a little sore. I hope I sleep well in a bed with sheets.

I don’t like news it’s always something bad so I changed it to Dr. Phil. Just as bad. I walked to Smoky Mountain Diner at 6 am and had a huge breakfast. I wore my sandals and had my rain gear on. It’s raining hard. There may be a window of no rain from 11am until 2pm. I will make myself go. I stopped at Dollar General and had a Mountain Dew and some Cheetos and hiked up the mountain at 11:30am. The sun is out and it is wonderful but super muggy. I have been slipping on wet leaves, roots and rocks for hours so I decided to look goofy and wear the micro spikes I have been carrying since Saturday. They work great! I haven’t slipped for an hour.

Wildcat was the only female and she had on leggings and a long sleeve shirt but no rain pack cover and no rain gear. I know she has to be freezing. It is about 45 degrees maybe even a little colder than that. They are doing 25-30 Mile Days through the Smokies and hope to finish the rest of the AT in less than 10 days.

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580848,"Last night was so quiet. I didn’t hear any owls, critters, or wind at all. When I woke up at 4:30am I was freezing so I put my extra clothes on and my down jacket and went back to sleep until 6am. Got my food bag and made coffee and chicken and rice. I packed up and went to the shelter to meet the three from last night. Nadine gave me trail magic homemade granola. It is some of the best I have ever had. Thank you Nadine! Also here were Hiker Bob and CCHiker. All three are hiking together for just a few days. I was hiking by 7:45am and stopped just up the hill to get water. It was a nice spring with a cement box that retains the water. First mountain and view of the day was Wesser Bald Tower. So beautiful and a 360 degree view! Hiking on I met up with Detour and Ishmael again at Cold Spring Shelter at 11 am. I have not seen them since Bland, VA. I hiked on and they passed me. Then came Wayah Bald at 5342’ elevation and a pretty stone tower on top. The trees along this ridge after leaving the tower have all been burned. Not sure when it happened. It wasn’t like that in 2015. I continued on and got to the sign for Siler Bald Shelter but decided to go up to the Bald to camp. I got up on top at 5:15pm and met a former thru hiker, NoNickname, up there. He has his tent set up down the hill. We talked and watched another most gorgeous sunset and then I set up my tent. Made spaghetti and mashed potatoes and hung the bag in a tree.  It’s an early bedtime but that’s okay I am tired. It will be another super cold night. It was a lovely day today. Goodnight.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580884,"Woke up this morning at 6 am but I really tossed and turned a lot last night. It is 26 degrees and a little windy up here so I am sure the wind chill makes it colder. I am lingering just a little so I can see a sunrise before I leave. Made my breakfast and was hiking at 8:15am. Today was really very nice and it seemed like the trail was gentler if that’s possible. The big mountain of the day was Albert Mountain at 5250’ elevation. It was gentle on the ascent but super steep and treacherous going down and very rocky. There are so many leaves on the trail and they are so slippery when you go down a mountain. You better believe I am still wearing my spikes. They are not just for snow. So today after just a little distance south of is Albert Mountain, I reached 2091 miles! That means I have 100 miles to go!!!!! I hiked on to Carter Gap Shelter and found Mrs Joy here. What a nice surprise. She took a bad fall going down Albert. There are two others here who started at Springer not too long ago. I don’t know how far they plan to go. All three are staying in the shelter but I set up my tent. Had dinner and sat by the fire for a few minutes. Hung my food and going to bed by 8pm. It is much warmer tonight. Maybe even in the forty’s. Sweet dreams.","Siler Bald

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580904,"is my Birthday! What better way to spend the day but hiking! I slept better and it wasn’t as cold. Got up at 5:30am, ate, packed, and said my fair wells and hiked out at 7:15am. I can feel the rain coming. Got to Standing Indian Mountain 5478’ elevation at 10 am and took the side trail to the top. Beautiful but super cold wind. The trail today was a lot like yesterday. Going down to Bly Gap was a very steep descent. Got to the NC/GA border at 3 pm and met Scout and Clover there. They are sectioning going north. The rain started as I entered Georgia and it rained all the way up and over As Knob and all the way to the shelter. So happy it’s not real cold. I arrived at the shelter at 5:30pm and I am the only one here. The rain finally stopped and I went down and got water and made dinner. As I was eating, a cute little mouse, yeah right, ran across the side railing and just stared at me. Ugh. Then there was another and another. I went out and found a spot and sat up my tent. I put my entire backpack and food inside the food storage box. I did leave my clothes line with my stinky clothes hanging in the shelter. I don’t think, but not sure, that the mice can walk on my slick rope. I hope the rain is done for the night. It is a sweet, very quiet night here tonight. Looking forward to a nero tomorrow. It is only 4 1/2 miles to Dicks Creek Gap. I haven’t had a shower since Sunday morning. That will be nice. Goodnight.","Carter Gap Shelter

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580943,"Nice sleep last night but it did rain for a little while. Maybe an hour or so. Had some condensation on the tent but it was manageable. Got up at 5:40am and brought all my stuff to the shelter. Made coffee and a chicken and rice burrito. I lingered for a while knowing I was only going 4 1/2 miles so I didn’t start hiking until 8 am. The fog finally lifted about 9 and the morning was nice. I arrived at Dicks Creek Gap at 10:30 am and called Top of Georgia Hostel. Sir Packs A Lot picked me up and then we dropped off two hikers at Unicoi Gap and went to the hostel. Took a nice shower and relaxed. At 4 pm Sir Packs A lot took myself, Mrs Joy and another hiker, Sweet Monkey, to Hiawassee. Dinner and resupply. The Ingles Grocery carries Mountain House. I’ve never seen that before but I didn’t need any because I had Dave send me a box here to the hostel. When we got back there were several other hikers here. A few names are Sequoia, Camel, Smalls, Monk, Scar,  and Granola. Having a very hard time getting to sleep with all the talking in the other room. There is no door to this bunk room so the light out there is not helping. I had to go out to the kitchen area twice and ask them to please be quiet. The pizza smells at 10 pm were lingering for hours. I guess I’m venting. It got quiet at 11 but it was hot even with the window next to me open. Yes , I am writing this after 11pm. Okay I’m going to try to sleep now. Goodnight.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580947,"Tossed and turned in the worst way all night long. Got up to go to the bathroom at 3:30am and someone was hacking in there and then started the shower. I went outside to the port a potty. I slept well from 4 to 6 am. Got up and had to hurry for my ride at 6:30 am to Unicoi Gap to slack pack north back to Dicks Creek Gap. Jo and Sandy, two ladies doing a section, rode with us but they are going back to Dicks Creek to go North. I apologized for being cranky last night. They said they understood. Got on the trail at 7!  No hiking poles!!! Yay. My pack might weight 5 pounds, if that. I feel like I can fly. I flew over Tray Mountain and then I started seeing some of the hikers that were at the hostel last night. I apologized for being cranky. The steep climb of the day was Kelly Knob. I had my tuna wrap lunch before going up so I had good energy. I was about a mile before Dicks Creek Gap when I saw Detour and Ishmael coming up the hill. There was a really cute bench at a little waterfall and Ishmael took my picture for me. I got to the gap at 10 minutes before 2 pm and decided to just walk the 1/2 mile to the hostel. I went in and talked with Sir Packs A Lot and asked if he would take me back to Unicoi today instead of in the morning and he said sure. 20 minutes later he said he can’t because it would interfere with the Hiker shuttle to town at 4pm. Ugh. I hurried and practically begged him to take me now, please. He reluctantly did but softened up on the way there. Thank you so very much Sir Packs A Lot! I immediately went up Blue Mountain. What a big difference with all my gear. I got to the damaged sign that used to be a trail for water. There is a lot of blowdown from Hurricane Irma. Lots of damage. I carefully climbed down to get water and carried it to the tent site. Found a great spot up here all alone. The moon is HUGE. I called Dave and planned my pickup for possibly Tuesday. I am so excited. I only have 50 miles to go! Dinner is spaghetti and potatoes. Dessert is hot chocolate and Crunch N Munch. Bedtime 7:30pm. Goodnight.","Dicks Creek Gap

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580966,"What a great decision I made yesterday. I love this little campsite up here on the mountain. I am at 3500’ elevation and I watched the moon rise last night, and then I watched it set this morning while the sun was coming up. It was even bigger this morning and had a most spectacular orange color!  I only took a mental picture because pictures are not accurate. I videoed it for myself but again it is just not accurate. I slept from 8 pm until 5:50am. I still move a lot during the night, it’s just the nature of camping for me. I roll over, sleep, roll over, sleep, all night long, every night. The dead tree I found last night to hang my food in held up. Made breakfast, packed. On trail at 7:45am. There are lots of shotgun blasts this morning. I guess the hunters are out in full swing. A man asked if I was doing a section and when I told him I did all of the AT this year so far, he said “Whaaaaaaat?” Haha. Funny. I love the day today. The weather is perfect. I got up to Cowrock Mountain by 1:45pm. Beautiful. Then on my way down a man asked me about my hike. He said I could probably get to Neel Gap today. Um, I had 4 miles to go and it was 2pm. I got to the gap at 3:40pm. I had a Parmesan sandwich and a soda there and hiked up Blood Mountain at 4pm. It is probably the last hard mountain on the AT. It is a very rocky uphill climb to 4442’ elevation. I made it to Blood Mountain Shelter by 5:30pm and watched the sunset with several other folks up here just for that. Then I hiked on and found this campsite. There is someone down the hill camping here also. I didn’t feel like cooking so I just had peanut butter on a tortilla but also half of a Hershey chocolate bar. I’m also a little lazy and living dangerously by not hanging my food bag tonight. Tomorrow will be another good weather day but Tuesday has storms in the forecast but for the afternoon. I hope to get many miles of these last 28 done tomorrow so I can get to Springer Mountain early Tuesday. We’ll see how it goes. I feel good. Bedtime is 8pm tonight. Goodnight.","2140.6 Tent Site

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581010,"What a great night. I slept from 8 pm until 5:40am. I am ready to tackle the day! Oh and I survived with my food in my tent. Another awesome moonrise last night and as I write this, moonset! I tried to be quicker this morning but I just can’t manage that. After breakfast I packed and was on the trail only 10 minutes faster than yesterday at 7:35am. I am hiking pretty fast today though. I got to Woody Gap at 10:45 am and ate my tuna wrap since there was a garbage can and I could throw the stinky package away. It is very windy and a cold wind today. Got to Gooch Gap at 12:20pm. Speed walking! Lots of cars here but sadly no trail magic so I just moved along. Going up the hill I saw the people that were redirecting the trail. The man told me I would be the last thru hiker on the old section. I feel special. When I got up to Sassafras Mountain the Army Airborne Rangers were training. It was cool to see them! I got to Hightower Gap and not a car in sight. No trail magic again. I hiked up the hill and found a water source and filled up all my water bottles. Granola and Scar both passed me at the water. They are going to Hawk Mountain Shelter and I am going to keep going to get my last night of stealth camping in. I hiked just a couple of miles more and found a really sweet spot and I really don’t want to hike in dark. I set up and made beef stroganoff and potatoes for dinner and hot chocolate and Oreo’s for dessert. Took a sponge bath because I really stink. I really can’t believe I have just 6.5 miles to go!!!!!!!! Praying that the rain holds off until the late afternoon tomorrow. Bedtime by 7:30pm! Goodnight.","Slaughter Creek Campsite

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581045,"Last night was my LAST night on the trail! I can’t believe it! I will be home in my bed tonight. I fell asleep pretty fast but when I woke up at 4am I just couldn’t go back to sleep. I got up and made my LAST cup of coffee and my LAST chicken and rice burrito and hiked out in the darkness for the LAST time with my headlamp at  5:45am. The past two mornings I would have been hiking in the moonlight. This morning is pitch black out. I Put my rain gear on at 6:30am but took it off again at 7:30am. I had some great memories hiking with Qinti as I passed the first Benton Mackaye Trail sign. I can’t believe how fast the day is going! I arrived at Springer Mountain at 9:15 am! I didn’t think I would be emotional but I am. I am here alone in the mystical fog. It is magical indeed. I signed the log book that is kept in the rock then headed down the 8.3 mile approach trail to Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge where Dave is picking me up. It rained the entire way. I am so happy to be done! 
Thank you to everyone who has visited my journal page. Thank you for your encouraging comments and your prayers. 
Today is the day that the Lord has made. Rejoice! And be glad in it.
