Ynot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521392,"Hi. I am Tony. Or Ynot on trail. Just like to give a little background and introduce myself to the community. 40yrs young. Father of a 21 yr old son and 5 year old boy/girl twins. Grandfather of 2. Married x3...Divorced x3. I am learning. In a wonderful relationship with a woman that wholeheartedly supports me and my dreams. I am also a 14 year Honorably Discharged Army vet. I initially learned of the AT and thru-hiking only a few months ago and have been addicted to the idea since. I told myself it was something I wanted to accomplish within the next 5 years or by my 45th birthday. The more I researched and the more I read blogs of past, present and future hikers, I couldn't scratch the itch, so I moved that date up to the Ides of March 2017. The only reason I am not embarking this Spring is due to too little planning/preparation time and funds. I look forward to following several of you on your journeys and trials this year.",,Introduction,"Feb 18, Thu",0
