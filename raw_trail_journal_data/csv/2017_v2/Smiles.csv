My journey began in March 2016 when I started the AT with a goal to be a through hiker. My experience with backpacking and serious hiking was zero! Living in Florida, my training hikes were pretty much all beaches with a draw bridge thrown in here and there for a little hill work. My good friend Mark Jones and I went up to Springer Mtn for a planned 10 day hike to check out the gear prior to my start. I lasted 3 days...the AT was not soft sand and flat.
So after modifying my training program to include a lot of Stair Master work outs, I was as ready as I could be for 2016.
My trek was cut short due to a foot injury that required surgery. But I did make 760 miles in 8 weeks and learned a lot about pretty much everything. I now feel confident to refer to myself as a ""Hiker.""
I will be starting back at Springer Mtn in March 2017 with my good Friend Grumpy that I had met on the AT in 2016 plus my son Ben. Ben will rotate off after about 10 days and hopefully join back up with us later on the trail as his schedule allows. Grumpy will now be known as Sidekick...as he stated, how can one be Grumpy on a trail as beautiful as the AT.
Very confident with my equipment list that I will share later...pretty much all proven.
Really excited and looking forward to meeting the Class of 2017!",,First Journal Entry -- Happy 2017,"Jan 04, Wed",0
Smiles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552989,"Training is ratcheting up....hoping to be in decent enough shape to start and then let the 1st two weeks on AT be Boot Camp for my legs and endurance. Living in Florida has its perks of year round comfort weather but lacks any incline/declines.
Typical week:
Monday & Wednesday - 12 mile hike on beach
Tuesday -- Golf and LA Fitness working Stair Master and Weights
Thursday -- 12 Mile hike on beach with full pack
Friday -- 12 mile hike on beach; lunch; 10 mile hike on mixed paths
Saturday & Sunday whatever feel like...at least 1 hour of some exercise a day.
Everyday -- stretches and core strengthening.

Smiles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553378,"Just got agreement from my Hiking Team Mates to pull the Start Date up to March 2nd. We will stay at the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega GA on March 1st and then have them shuttle us to the Springer Trail Head on March 2nd. So feet on the Trail March 2nd. Really excited for the earlier start as the Stair Master is really getting old!! 
Hiking with Grumpy out of Colorado. Grumpy and I met each other on the AT in 2016 and I really enjoyed his company over several weeks. We both ended early (Grumpy logged over 530 miles) due to trail related injuries and we will start together for 2017. The third member is my Son (Trail Named TBD but he is a Fireman, so pretty sure that will be quickly rectified.) Really excited to have my Son for the 1st 10 days when he has to rotate off and head back to the city life; however, as a validated AT Section Hiker. 
One of the key benefits of starting with Ben is that I can bring multiple versions of gear, try them all, and keep the ones I like the best while sending the rest home with Ben...I know, kinda diabolical...",,Improved Plan - Excited,"Jan 16, Mon",0
Smiles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553564,"I agree...I am a bit of a data geek when it comes to hiking. They say that there are more than 5 million steps required to complete the trail. Could you track your steps taken? What would be your personal HR Avg over the course of a thru hike? How may feet +/- elevation change today? I know...a lot of pretty useless stuff, but if you are interested and can track with minimal effort why not?
I had two watches used primarily for hiking. Just added my third this week. They are:
1) Suunto Traverse (carried on my 2016 Hike)
2) Garmin 910XT
3) FitBit Charge 2
The FitBit Charge 2 just added this week.
The Suunto and Garmin are both great watches and provide a significant amount of data. They both require a HR Monitor Belt which is just not going to happen for a long distance hike. While both have excellent GPS functionality, that functionality comes at a heavy battery drain, so once again, not long trail practical unless you plan on recharging every night. Between the AT Guide and Guthook App, GPS is really not needed. I did really enjoy the Suunto daily log of Steps Taken and Elevation Gain/Loss. The altimeter on the Suunto was so darn accurate that you knew exactly how much elevation was required to go on the bigger summits. This is just fun data to have...not going to get you over that next ridge.
The FitBit Charge 2 does not have a GPS function on the watch, which is not a big deal. It does have a really accurate built in HR monitor, interfaces Bluetooth to my Samsung S6 with a slick GUI. The battery life is stated as 5 days, this has not been tested but 3+ days would be pretty sufficient. It tracks steps, HR, Calories, and elevation gain (stated in ""stairs""). With ability to track resting HR and Sleep Quality, may also give you another insight to your physical well being. I will be testing this watch through next couple weeks and will update my Gear List with final notes.
What do you carry and why? Comments appreciated by email or Guestbook.
See you on the Trail!",,Wearable Electronics,"Jan 20, Fri",0
Smiles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553608,"While I would like to go electronics naked...not going to happen. I have to have periodic contact with a lot of variables plus as stated earlier, I am a data geek. My only two carry items that require power are my Samsung S6 and watch. The Samsung combines a lot of resources into one unit. Phone, Camera, music, books, lists, Guthook App, Journal, town POI, etc. Standard smart phone kinda stuff.
To keep these devices charged between towns, I use a 10,000mAH power cell. Able to charge two devices simultaneously and pretty rapid recharge when in town. Have never really run it dry...so would say I can easily get by for 6-7 days between plug ins.
It is a Sharper Image Model TSI 781. Not sure if still in production as I bought it last year for around $35.
Deminsions are 6""x2.5""x1/2"". Weight 7.5oz.
Pretty simple, not ruggedized, and light weight. Can go lighter, just less charging capacity.",,Rechargable Power Cell,"Jan 21, Sat",0
Smiles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553759,"Really love ""The A.T. Guide"" by David ""AWOL"" Miller. Just received my 2017 versions. I buy the loose leaf version to carry only about 6 weeks worth of pages. While on the Trail, I like to use the pages to collect passport stamps and make notes. When in town, send the used pages home along with postcards to family and friends.
I buy two copies. The loose leaf version and a bound version. My Home Team keeps the bound version to help follow along and for trail contact info if needed.
Along with the Guide, I also use the Guthook's AT Guide App. Really a nice tool to have on the trail. By keeping my cell phone in ""airplane mode"" it minimizes battery drain while still providing GPS Updates to Guthook. Will really come in handy when you loose track of the trail or just validating you are still on the trail. Necessary -- No. Nice to have -- Absolutely. Benefit - takes up no space (already carrying your cell phone) and can provide close to real time updates on water problems, closures, etc.",,Maps and Guides,"Jan 24, Tue",0

Having experience now with the FitBit Charge 2, decision made to take it on the 2017 journey.
In my personal opinion:
The watch weighs in at a measly 1.2 ounces. Charging cord at .6 ounces. The watch can go at least 4 days between recharging, probably 5. And when you do recharge off your portable power source, it charges quickly and uses very little of the stored power.
The bluetooth interface to phone keeps all statistics and you only need to activate the phones bluetooth every couple days to upload data. Takes less than a minute. So minimal drain on phone.

Features I like best?
Heart Rate profile -- Shows avg for day/week; resting HR; how much time in cardio and peak; and feeds to the calories burned calculation. Why is the good data to know? If your resting HR starts to rise, could be a good signal that a zero day is needed.
Sleep Profile -- Shows how much sleep you are getting and the quality of that sleep. With Hiker Midnight, you will have no problem with the hours of sleep but if you are very restless while sleeping, could mean a change is needed in your setup. Bigger sleeping bag, warmer clothes, change in pad, etc. If you are getting a good nights sleep but constantly tired, then may just be adjusting to trail life. One young hiker may have a great insight...he stated that everybody he meets over 50 has sever sleep apnea and snores...:-) Your sleep profile may tell the story. 
Calories Burned -- will show your daily and weekly calorie burn rate based on HR and duration on elevated activity. Helps to justify the Pizza Hut Large Stuff Crust Pizza and full salad bar at your next town.
Steps -- Fun data point. When your city friends talk about their 5,000 steps a day, you can casually comment that your average day was 30,000 steps with 1/2 of them uphill.
Stairs -- Just another fun data point. FitBit tacks pressure changes and gives you credit in 10' increments. In FL, going over a 30ft draw bridge equals 3 flights of stairs. Not sure how it will track in the mountains.
What I do not do -- Do not run interface to your phones GPS for route tracking. Just burns up battery time.

Pack really feels good...no hot spots and sitting well on the hips. No meaning to advertise but really do like my ULA Catalyst.
Was recalling fond memories of 2016 and my 1st night on the Trail at Hawk Mtn Shelter. Set up my brand new Big Agnes Fly Creek 2 Platinum. Got up during the night and before getting back in, just had to stare up at all the stars. Got pretty dizzy and fell right on top the tent, of course this was about 2AM and camp site was crowded. Bent a pole pretty bad but luckily Big Agnes included a splice so was able to patch it up and used ""as is"" for next 4 weeks until swapping out for a ZPack Duplex.

When leaving Fontana Dam you enter the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. We had a great hike through the Smokies completing in 5 days. Weather was in 30s at night and 50s during day. Only 1 big storm at night but since we were in a shelter...no problem. It did make the trail from Clingman Dome to Newfound Gap (mile 206.8) real icy or muddy. Couple slip and falls but no damage other than pride.
On the north side of Newfound Gap, ice cleared up and trail views were awesome. Great overlooks and lot of high ridge running. Still cold in AM but with effort required on uphills was great hiking weather. One of the selfies is of icicles forming on the brim of my hat fro sweating...interesting to be submitted freezing yet heavy sweating when. Only wearing a light sweater.
Coming out of the Smokies met my Brother-in-law, John Gassler. Hiked out of the Smokies together to his car where he had Trail Magic for our group of 4 (Nuke, Stitches, Just Phil, and myself). Bananas, Apples, and Snicker Bars...real treat.
1st stop after the Smokies was legendary Standing Bear Hostel (mile 240.3) on March 23rd. Not much more than a hot shower, warm bed, and frozen pizza heated up...could not have been better.
Early out next morning at 7AM under threat of rain and thunderstorms all day but never materialized. Great day hiking that included starting the day with a 2200+ foot climbs out of the Gap and summit of Max Patch. Lot of uphill but end of day was a great downhill run into Roaring Fork Shelter (mile 255.5). An area full of waterfalls and creeks. Slept in tent with rushing Creek about 25 yes away. Great night sleep.
March 27 on the trail at 7AM with one primary goal...make the run to town of Hot Springs that day...an 18 mile run. Tough day with a lot of uphills starting out but made Hot Springs (mile 273.4) by 3pm. Stayed at Laughing Heart Hostel...real nice hostel and had a private room. NUKE and I will take 2 zero days in Hot Springs to rest up. Liz joining me on Tue and Wed at the historic Iron Horse Station.
Will be back on trail Thursday AM with next town Erwin TN about 6 days out.
