I had been retired for two years and it was time, bad knees or no. Soon after retiring I began racing vintage race cars, fulfilling a childhood dream. 82 Mazda RX7 and a 72 Datsun 240Z. Great fun.Last November during a race physical my Dr. advises that he didn't like the sounds my lungs were making. No problem we'll take steroids and antibiotics, thinking bronchitis. So now its April 7, 2014. Didn't make the hike. After months of x-rays, ct scans and finally a pet scan last Monday, I've been told I have lung cancer.Very early stage, and the prognosis looks good. Meet with my team at UVa tomorrow to decide on course of action.Going to try to go with surgery asap, because I would like to put in a new knee, and rehab, and get in trail shape before Feb. 2015.Thanks, Aleve",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Mon",0

Aleve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565021,Hi Everybody. After spending another night at Delaware Water Gap I was at the bakery when it opened at 8am. Their breakfast sandwich is pretty good. I walked through town and was back on trail at 9am. The climb up to Sunfish Pond was sedate and the views down the east side of the ridge were stunning. I arrived at the Mohican Outdoor Center at 3:30 and was told they had no rooms but tenting would be available and tenting under a pavilion would be acceptable. With cold rain coming down and temps dropping I stayed two nights.  The staff at the Center were outstanding. More later.,"Delaware Water Gap

Aleve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565023,"Hi Everybody.  I left the Center and was on trail by 7:30. Windy day and climbing the Catfish Lookout Tower was interesting. I tented at the Brink Shelter with Trail Snail, O Man and Old Growth, all flip flippers who started at Harper's Ferry. Water on the Trail in NJ is mainly murky pond runoff and bog water, my filter will need replacing soon. More later.","Mohican Outdoor Center

I arrived at US 206 at 9am and walked down to Branchville for breakfast at the Diner. The breakfast was great but the walk back up to the Trail was a bear.

Not much wind today so the bugs were more aggressive. I liked the High Point State Park with it stone work. The attendant at the HQ building gave each of us a free coke, tasted mighty good. The last few miles to Unionville were an absolute bear, straight up and straight down. I went directly to the Wits End Tavern,  and had a great burger and a beer and multiple glasses of iced water. I left and walked to the park just behind the post office to set up my tent. Later my friends and I went back to the Tavern where I treated them to dinner, Trail magic to my fellow hikers.

Aleve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565036,"Hi Everybody.  Very heavy dew this morning so I set my rain fly out to dry while I went to Horlers Store for breakfast and coffee. Horlers has a great assortment of bagels and doughnuts, not to mention ice cream. Moose Droppings at 7:30am, what a great way to start your day.  The temps today are approaching 90 degrees today and the hike, while short, is straight up and straight down for most of the day. I absolutely loved the boardwalks at Pochuck Creek. I arrived at the NJ 94 trail head and called the Appalachian Motel and they picked me up 5 minutes later. The rate at the motel is acceptable and the do your laundry for an additional ten. I ordered a pizza and am currently sitting here updating my page. Tomorrow will be into the 90s here and I plan on being back on trail by 7am.  More later.","Unionville NY

Hiked around the Wallkill Preserve perimeter, a wildlife sanctuary and the Pochuck Creek boardwalks and suspension footbridge. Beautiful countryside for sure. I planned to shorten my day and stay at the Appalachian Motel at Vernon and so said goodbye to Trail Snail as she was pushing on. O Man and Old Growth pushed on also. More later.","Unionville NY

I didn't hit the Trail til close to 10am as I spent most of the morning talking with REI about shipping a new knee brace and a few other things. I made the mistake of having the motel at Vernon wash my old one, it disintegrated. I will spend the next couple of days wishing I had one. The State of New York says hi in a big way with constant steep ups and downs. I arrive at the Bellvale Creamory an hour before closing at 9pm. Very busy place. I purchase a quart of chocolate ice cream and a few bottles of water and end up tenting at the trailhead. Long day.","Vernon Nj

The way I look at it, all the steeps now are getting me ready for Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Climbing up Bear Mtn, I was impressed with the stone steps. The top of the Mtn was chaos with people everywhere.  I stopped at a vending machine for a miniature can of Pringles and a coke before starting down to the park. Again, very nice stone work. No rooms available in town except for the Bear Mtn Lodge. Expensive stay. The next morning I walk to the post office but my REI package not there yet.

It's amazing how fast these people are. Hiked through old mining areas and walked on what I think was a small gauge railroad bed. From the guthook app I learned that pizza could be delivered to the RHO Shelter, I passed this into Luna and we were moving. When I arrived at the shelter the bunks and shelter were full so I tented. There were about 20 hikers there and pizza was ordered and beer run made, some had a very late night. More later.","Canopies Hill Rd

Aleve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577353,"Hi Everybody. I had trouble with the battery in my Galaxy Note 5 phone about halfway through this years hike, didn't want to charge after a system update, so I stopped updating here. I hiked from Fayetteville PA to Gorham NH and ended my hike there because of my right (human) knee. The Whites finally did the knee in, would liked to have been able to push on to Katahdin but could not and knee replacement surgery is scheduled for mid october. The left  (titanium) knee worked like a charm the entire hike and I'm amazed and pleased. So it looks like I'll finish the trail next year, not exactly the thru hike I envisioned last year but I'm not disappointed, I've met some incredible people and enjoyed myself greatly.Thanks for following, Aleve.","
