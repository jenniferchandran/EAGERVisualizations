Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519368,"Brew Ha is planning a 2nd attempt at the AT in April of this year. (Check out his 2011 journal entries.) This time, his bride will be joining him. ""Tonto"" and Brew Ha have done several long section hikes together and they have found they complement each other in many ways. She is the planner (thus her trail name), a realist, and open to change. He, on the other hand, likes to take things as they come and has been known to set unrealistic goals and then stubbornly work to achieve success. Despite their differences, they have been together for over 37 years so I guess they have learned to accommodate one other.They will begin at the NOC in North Carolina and plan to be in Harpers Ferry before the 4th of July. (Tonto and Brew Ha have section hiked the Springer to NOC section over the past couple of years.) They will leave the trail after Harpers Ferry for their annual Independence Day bash in Blairsville Georgia. After the bash they will either return to the trail or delay the 2nd half until next year. Tonto and Brew Ha are accumulating gear, dehydrating food, and planning for the hike while preparing for retirement, selling a house, and moving. If all goes as planned, their daughter and son in law will drop them at the NOC on April 15th and they will head up the mountain toward Harpers Ferry.",,I'm Back ,"Jan 08, Fri",0
Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525286,"Three days to finish a career that began over 39 years ago. Six employers. Tenure ranging from 60 days to over 28 years. Three days and we begin the first, ""go-go"", phase of retirement. The phase when, time, health and resources allow one to do the things in life that were not possible when employed, raising a family, or living on hot dogs and Kraft Mac and Cheese. Three days before we prepare to close on the sale of our home and move to the Georgia Lake House. The place that served us well over the past 12 years as our retreat. The get-away-from-the-city place where you can still sit on the back porch and listen to the silence. The place the kids love to visit to water ski, sit by the camp fire, and of course enjoy Mom's fresh-baked pies.Three days before we leap into the unfamiliar world where responsibilities and deadlines are self-imposed rather than part of our job descriptions. Stress, job travel, business meetings, placating Doctors, meeting objectives; a thing of the past.Three days before we begin the final preparations for our AT adventure. Food prep, equipment review, logistics, keeping pack weight in check. Then two preparatory weeks before we embark on our quest for Katahdin. Three days.",,3 to go!,"Mar 29, Tue",0
Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527471,"Two weeks will be plenty of time to tie up loose ends before we hit the trail. So we thought anyway. April 15 is still a go, but it has taken a bit more effort to git er dun than we anticipated.Brew Ha retired on April Fools Day as planned. Tonto attended a baby shower Saturday afternoon. We both enjoyed the musical Kinky Boots at the Fox Theatre Saturday evening. We finished packing and moving household items to the lake Sunday afternoon. We closed on the sale of the home Monday morning. Left the closing with a truck load of furniture and our 70 pound boxer, Schmodee, destined for our son's home in Charlotte. Unloaded Monday evening and then enjoyed a wonderful Italian feast on the patio. Up early Tuesday morning to return the truck and then we were on our way to Canton, OH to visit Tonto's mom. Completed honey do list, visited with Brew Ha's brother in Columbus and celebrated Tonto's birthday with a wonderful dinner at Bender's Steakhouse Thursday evening. Back in the car Friday morning headed for Charlotte and a second birthday dinner / celebration.Left Schmodee in Charlotte where she will be cared for during our time on the trail. Thanks Byron and EJ and of course, Copper (Schmodee's cousin).Got to the lake house Saturday mid day and opened the door to a complete disaster area. We had boxes everywhere--time to unpack. It is now Monday evening and we are 90% un-packed. We have packed our food in boxes and mailed the first two drops. Byron and EJ have the remainder of the boxed food and we will coordinate future shipments through them. Tomorrow we finish unpacking and begin assembly of our packs. Wednesday we visit our daughter, son in law, and granddaughter in Atlanta before heading back to Blairsville for our last night underroof. It has been nice living so close to Erin, Shephen and of course our little Bailey. We are now living two hours away and about to hit the trail for up to 6 months. Bitter sweet to say the least.The shuttle arrives Friday at 7:30 for our ride to the trailhead. It hasn't been easy, but we are gitten er dun!",,Gittin er dun,"Apr 11, Mon",0
Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528041,"Great first day, with 60 degree weather and sunshine. Climbed over 4000 feet in 6.5 miles. Got an early start after a taxi ride from the Lakehouse. Cashew butter tortillas for lunch and we decided upon lasagna for dinner.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528251,"We had a great dinner last night. Lasagna and a nice Black Box Merlot. Yea, it was worth the 16 ounces of additional weight. Got to keep Tonto ""happy"".It was a cool evening. When Brew Ha was making coffee it was around 38 degrees with a stiff breeze. Not whining, just the way it is. Got on the trail around 9:45 and immediately climbed to 5,000 feet and had a spectacular view across the valley. Cheouh Knob for those filling at home with a map. Tonto sets a mean pace, but she has not lost her partner yet. We enjoyed some nice descents into Stecoah Gap ( NC 143), were we enjoyed our first trail magic. Bananas and apples. Little did we know Jake was waiting just ahead. Jacobs Ladder was a killer. Elevation gain of 900 feet in about .6 miles. We just about had our first mutiny.Arrived at Brown Fork Shelter at around 4:30. Got to get busy with chores.Having a blast!","Sassafras Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528448,"So we got up and out of Browns Fork by 8:45 this morning. We are getting faster as we begin to get a routine together. Brew Ha spent several minutes looking for his bandana only to realize it was in his pocket. Like I said, we need a routine. Beautiful weather, in fact a little warm. Tonto wanted to pack sun screen for the hike, of course Brew talked her out of carrying ""the extra weight . After all, we are in the trees all day. Guess what? We were burned today in 80 degree sunshine. Hardwoods at 4500 foot elevation have no leaves yet. So, Bew agreed to a night in the Fontana Lodge as a peace keeping measure. Apparently it worked.We have met some interesting characters already. Today we kept running into Walmart. The poor guy arrived at Springer Mt. 3 weeks ago from Iowa. He expected to have outfitters there to furnish equipment. Needless to say there are no outfitters near Springer, so off to Walmart he went to supply for his walk. Not the best design he said, but he is getting by.A few blisters, sore knees, and tired muscles. Oh and add sun burn, Tonto says. However, we made to the Dam and are enjoying a shower, and real porcelain.","Browns Fork Shelter
",Fontana Resort,"Apr 17, Sun",13
Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528907,"Fontana Resort was outstanding. We enjoyed a shower, a fine meal, and received our first resupply box. Unfortunately the supplies added weight that we had to trudge up out of the valley. We got started fairly early at around 10:00. Had to weight for the shuttle and stop for denatured alchahol to fuel the stove. We had a beautiful view across the TVA lake that is 27 miles long with sever hundred miles of shoreline. The climb long and steady gaining 2100 feet in 4 miles. We had gorgeous weather, maybe a little hot in the high 70's.On the way we climbed a fire tower at 3800 feet called Shucks stack. Tonto lead the way to Mollies Ridge shelter. Many people at the shelter but one stood out. He is doing an 8 day hike through Smokey Mt National Park. We named him Spice Rack. Now this dude weighs maybe 145 soaking wet. His pack weight is well over 50 pounds. (Most try to be about 30 pounds). He had nearly any spice and flavor enhancer you could imagine including Sirracha. When he swung his pack onto his shoulders the earth shifted. So we enjoyed Spice Rack, who incidentally is a Sommelier studying Micro Biology. Enough said.I believe Tonto would have thrown in the towel if not for the vista views and the amazing wild flowers. We are hiking through Smokey Mountain National Park which required a hiker registration and fee. Tonto wonders where the money goes as the shelters do not include even the crudest of outhouses, i.e. Find a bush. The.price for a night of luxury I guess.","Fontana Resort

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529110,"Tonto spent a lot of time preparing dehydrated meals for our AT adventure. The meals are quite good and very light for packing. We generally get into camp, fire up our alchahol stove to boil water and then hydrate the culinary delight with boiling water. The food is in quart freezer bags. We then place the freshly hydrated food into a insulated pouch for ""cooking"". After 30 minutes the food is fully cooked and ready for consumption. We had shrimp and rice for dinner. The portions were healthy and Tonto offered her left overs to our camp mates. Deisel scooped it up in a second and proceeded to brag on the dinner which fed to an ego and brightened up Tonto's day. A win-win for sure.Now to say that today's hike was a challenge is being kind. The map shows rolling hills st 4000+ feet. Climbed over Rocky Top TN this afternoon. The song is not my favorite, and the SECteam that insists on singing it at football games is a rag-tag bunch of loosers but the views from Rocky Top were fantastic.The steep climbs and rocky decents brought out a beautiful set of blisters. A little mole skin and we were good to go.In SMNP you must stay in a shelter unless it is full. Some like sharing their sleeping chamber with 10 snoring,farting strangers and the pesky mice. Others prefer a private quarter to themselves. So when you arrive the wait begins. Who will hold out for a tent spot. If a Ranger happens by there is a fine levied if the shelter is not full. So far, so good. Brew Ha to date has personally endured Tonto's sleeping habits without sharing with others.The trail was tough today, but it seemed whenever the trail got tough we were provided a hillside of petite white and lavender wild flowers that at times looked like snow cover. Absolutely gorgeous. Flower power at it best.Living the dream!","Mollies Ridge Shelter
",Derrick Knob Shelter,"Apr 19, Tue",12
Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529124,"We got up early this morning, had a cup of Joe, and homemade breakfast energy bars (hence forth known as bowel bombs). We met some great hikers at Derrick Nob. Summer Breeze is a laid-back 20 something, long-haired great guy. He sleeps in a hammock, which is fairly popular with hikers. Google and Small Foot were recently married and reside in Cleveland GA. It is fun meeting people and following them day to day until someone jumps ahead or falls behind. This is especially true in SMNP because everyone must stay at a shelter.So the plan was to like 7 miles to Double Spring Shelter and then decide if we should proceed to Clingman's Dome (the highest point on the Appalachian Trail), and then 4 miles more to Mt Collins Shelter or stay put for the night. Some of us felt strongly that we should stay at Double Springs and when we arrived we agreed to call it a day.Then down the trail from Clingman's Dome came a news paper reporter from Knoxville with a photographer. He is doing a story on the increased number of hikers due to the recent movie, A Walk In The Woods. He asked us questions about our hike, our reasons for hiking, etc. He was surprised that only Tonto and I were at the shelter, he expected to interview 20 or more hikers. We talked and pictures were taken for nearly an hour. Finally one more hiker appeared and they were on him like white on rice. So about 2 hours in to our stay, the photographer casually mentioned it was supposed to rain tomorrow and Friday. Brew Ha looked at Tonto and calmly suggested they climb the mountain today rather than in the rain. That went over like a fart in church. Reluctantly, they agreed and up Clingman's Dome they strolled.This was not an easy climb to 6667 feet, the decent was worse with rocks and large step downs. We left at 3:00 and arrived at Mt Collins Shelter at 7:15. Brew Ha is praying for rain tomorrow, otherwise Tonto may strangle him in his sleep.We arrived at the shelter, pitched the tent, eat snack food for dnnet and crashed. It was cold and extremely windy, but we were snug and asleep by 8:30. Biggest mileage day yet, and we are off to Gatlinburg tomorrow. Oh, and be sure to read about us in Knoxville paper.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529225,"We entered an evergreen forest for the first time as we descended Clingman's Dome. The high winds overnight swayed the trees making an ocean-like white noise. We arose from our slumber at 6:30 and wanted to remain in the quilt and wait for the sun to heat up the air. When Brew Ha loosened the valves on the sleeping pads we rolled out of the tent and into the Tundra. The wind was viscous causing havoc with the alchahol stove and delaying Tonto morning treat, Starbuck's instant coffee. After a quick breakfast of hot cereal we headed DOWN the trail. We had good trail with a few climbs and some steps. Finally we heard traffic on US 441 and we knew we were close to Newfound Gap and a 15 mile hitch to Gatlinburg. The plan is to take a zero in Gatlinburg and watch it rain.In a parking area at Mewfound Gap a Baptist Church set up Trail Magic. Sodas, fruit, cookies, candy, and best of all, a free shuttle to Gatlinburg. We took advantage of all they offered and were checking into the Grand Prix Motel by 2:30. The Motel is clean, the owner extremely helpful, and they have a coin laundry on site. To be clear, this is not the Ritz. Laundry done we headed to Mellow Mushroom for pizza, salad, and beer. So good.For anyone not familiar with Gatlinburg, it is best described as the place Carnies go for vacation and retire. The town has lots of eateries and a fabulous outfitter. We plan to stay off our feet, lay around, watch TV, and plan the next week. By the way, it did not rain a drop today, but Tonto is very forgiving.","Mt Collins Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529813,"We had a very relaxing day in G-burg. Had a long quiet coffee time at Starbucks with several teenagers visiting for High School band competition. They sure know more about cell phones, coffee drinks, and relationships then I ever will. Quite entertaining. We then hit the local breakfast joint and enjoyed eggs, sausage, and home fries. We proceeded , in the rain, to the local outfitter to purchase a mirror and an over the shoulder boulder holder for Tonto. Then back to our luxurious accommodations at the Grand Prix. We claimed our drop box full of food we had shipped from home and packed the stuffs away in our food bags. The rest of the afternoon was spent watching TV. It rained nearly all day but supposed to clear tomorrow.Went to Melting Pot for dinner. Haven't been to a Fodue joint in years. Good and plenty.When we retiurned to the Grand Prix there were several local police officers questioning hikers. Apparently there was a call regarding loud and vulgar language. They termed it disturbing the peace. They got it sorted out and the excitement died to a quiet, peaceful abode. Early in the wrack as we have to catch a 8:30 shuttle back up the mountain to Newfound Gap and the pedestrian highway to Maine.","Gatlinburg, TN

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529816,"Up at 7:00 to shower, pack, eat, and walk to the outfitter to grab the 8:30 shuttle provided by the Baptist Church. These guys are true Angels. Free rides daily the entire month of April. Thanks guys!We arrived at Newfound gap and a fog bank, with strong winds. Most of us were dressed in shorts and short sleeve shirts. On went the winter jackets, hats and everything else easily accessible in the pack. He trail climbed 1000 feet over the next 2 miles. We were sure the fog would burn off and the wind would die down. Neither happened all day. Even with the climb out of the gap we never warmed up. Three miles in we stopped at Icewater Spring shelter and put on more clothes. The weather was poor timing as the vistas we were passing were supposed to be breathtaking. We will never know.   We intended to do 10 miles. However, we learned that a shelter ahead had bear activity and it was rumored that the Rangers were closing it down. That gave us little choice but to gut out 15 miles, not only today but tomorrow as well. If only we didn't have to stay at shelters, oh well. The day was long and the hills took their toll, but we crawled into the Tri-Corner Nob shelter at 7:00. We ate, set up the tent and crashed.Long cold day, and a very cold and windy night.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529975,"This was our second 15 mile day and we have the blisters to show for it. A lot of hills today both up and down. We got started at 8:40. This seems to be our magic time. We awaken around 6:30, after having hit the sack at hiker midnight(8:30). It takes about 2 hours to make coffee and a hot breakfast, break camp, pack up, and get on our way. Tonto has been nursing ( no pun intended as she is a RN) blisters on her feet the past 2 days. We are applying mole skin to protect the wound but the constant ups and downs throughout the day take their tole. We got to the shelter late, around 6:15, and there were no tent spaces available that were reasonably flat. So we climbed a small hill and found a spot. Upon returning to the shelter to cook dinner, Google informed us we had set up in the toilet area. Sure enough there was no privy so the Park Service designated a toilet area instead. Sure enough upon closer review, there was definite evidence that we set up on the mine field. No problem, we've slept in trashier hotels than this. We honkered down for the night and slept like babies.We had lasagna for dinner and believe me, Tonto out-did herself on this one. We were licking our freezer bags with delight.Living the dream in a field of poo!","Tri Corner Nob Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529990,"We bid farewell to Little Foot and Google this morning. We have been moving along for several days together and they are a lot of fun to see when we drag our sorry carcasses into camp every night. They are a young married couple from Cleveland GA who were able to get time from there jobs to do the trail. I told them we got time also, all the time in the world.The trail dropped800 feet over our first 3 miles. We left SMNP and soon crossed under I-40. A mile beyond the interstate is Standing Bear Hostel. We had planned to do a resupply at the hostel. We had been warned that the place had limited supplies and this rang true. We managed to scarf a couple sodas, a microwave Jimmy Dean biscuit, two packs of crackers, instant mashed potatoes, and TP all for $11. Not bad for a hostel in the middle of nowhere. We left the hostel and completed our 10.5 mile day into Groundhog Creek Shelter. The shelter is in a beautiful gap and the gnats rule the domain. We ate a gormet meal of instant tadors, Hamburg, and mixed veggies all combined together. It really is better than it sounds I guess. To top it off Tonto served hot tea.Tonto believes she saw her first bear. It crossed the trail in front of her and ran into the woods. Brew cannot confirm nor deny the sighting. By the time Tonto quit waving her arms and pointing while running behind poor Brew Ha the bear was long gone. I guess he took one whiff of the stinky guy and headed for the hills.We are both dragging a little due to the high miles we are logging. The good news is we may get into Hot Springs a day early. Not certain but a good possibilty. Maybe a soak in a mineral spring will do us both good. We go off trail this weekend for a wedding in Wrightsville Beach NC. The son of a life-long friend, Bryan Sherrick is getting hitched. Our son, an Internet sourced official, will marry them on the beach.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530161,"Tonto is funny about getting up in the mornings. I know she is awake but she tries to pretend otherwise. We really have a luxurious sleeping arrangement. Picture two blow up swim rafts connected by two elastic bands. Now place a fleece quilt around the bottom of the two rafts and then attaching to the two elastic straps. In essence it is a double mat, quilt bed. It allows for movement you don't have with mummy bags and is quite warm. Anyway, I pull the plugs on the mattresses causing Tonto to bottom out onto the tent floor. This really gets her going. It is high risk poker on my part, but well worth the verbal abuse.So ""we"" got up and out of camp at our usual 8:45 after a cup of coffee and a hot breakfast of grits, eggs, and bacon. Not too shabby. We have a 13 mile day ahead including a climb up famous Max Patch Bald. The climb up Max was brutal, complete with steps tall enough for a horse but not an aging couple with sore knees. Anyway, we get to the summit and there are families with young children, old codgers with cameras, dogs, and a women's hiking club. Tonto and I looked on in amazement, how did they get up the climb? After lunch and as we began the decent on the opposite side of the bald it became obvious. This route was as easy as the opposite approach was tough. We made good time the rest of the afternoon over mainly rolling terrain. We arrived early by our standards at around 4:30. Got camp established, fetched water, and devoured Szechwan Chicken dish Tonto had dehydrated. We are 13 miles from Hot Springs and there is rain forecast for Thursday. We may just hightail it into town and enjoy a bed, real food, and watch it rain. To be determined.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Not sure which got her going, but she was up first, chose to skip her morning coffee, and had camp down and packed by 7:30. It was a humid day and we harvested water twice to stay hydrated. Typical rolling terrain with 2 significant climbs and one monster downhill into Hot Springs. We arrived in town around 4:00, took showers, and headed for the Spring Creek Tavern for burgers and beer. As we enjoyed the fine dining a thunderstorm kicked up and we enjoyed watching the rain.We will do laundry in the morning and then catch a ride to Asville NC and pick up our rental car. We will drive to the wedding in Wrightville Beach and return to Hot Springs On Sunday evening. By then we hope the trail will be open. The Forest Service closed the trail due to fires in the area. We are told Monday will be the earliest the trail will reopen. They are shuttling hikers from Hot Springs and dropping them north of the fire zone.Today's hike was typical for this area. We have been treated with wild flowers over the past several days. Today we enjoyed Trillium, Spring Glory, Lady Slippers, and Trout Lillies.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530222,"Tonto and Brew Ha enjoyed a restful night at the IronHorse Inn in Hot Springs. The rooms were located above a restaurant/bar that had live music till 9:00, well past our normal 8:30 bed time. But the musician was quite good and the soothing sound helped relax us. We both wanted to go downstairs and listen to the music but we just did not have the energy to do so. The thunder, lightning and pouring rain outside made us grateful for a good roof over our heads last evening. Now the IronHorse is aptly named. For those who watched the movie, My Cousin Vinny, there is a scene where Joe Pesci is awakened from his much needed rest by a series of trains passing right by his room. Yup, we heard the Iron Horse go by at 12:45, 4:45, and 6:45. Quaint little inn but be sure to bring your ear plugs.We did laundry this morning and confirmed our travel plans with the outfitter in town (taking us to Asheville) and the rental car company. We are now enjoying some time in the local library catching up on the news. Later we have a one hour mineral, hot springs bath scheduled at the local resort. Tonto has her way of working these little pleasures into our trip.The fire remains an issue as more and more hikers pile up here in Hot Springs.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531474,"We have several updates for today's journal. The wedding in Wrightsville Beach NC, a game-changing decision from Tonto, and an unexpected set-back for the two of us.We caught a shuttle out of Hot Springs to Asheville, NC Thursday evening. They dropped us as the Quality Inn on Tunnel Road as requested. The Inn did not have our reservation and it was determined our room was booked at another Quality Inn further out on Tunnel Road. Of course our ride had left and so we caught the bus for a 3 mile ride to our hotel. No problem. Friday morning Enterprise picked us up (after they too went to the wrong hotel) and we were on our way to Wrightsville Beach. A long 6 hour drive later we were greeted by our son Byron at the rental house on the Beach. Within 20 minutes our daughter Erin, her husband Stephen, and our granddaughter, Bailey arrived. Byron's wife Erin would join us later in the evening. A quick walk to the beach and we all enjoyed watching Bailey's first beach experience. The beach wedding began at 10:45 AM with Byron officiating. (Registered on line as a wedding official) A nice, quick wedding with about 125 guests. Then off to the reception. We later grilled shrimp, grouper and mahi mahi for dinner and enjoyed a fine wine from our California wine trip in February. It was great visiting with friends we have known all our lives and rehashing stories from the ""glory years"". All in all a fantastic trip.Tonto has been having issues with a sore knee and finally ended up wrapping it the past couple of days on the trail and taking Advil. She has been a real trouper but has decided to leave the trail to heal. We do not want any chance of permanent damage and quite frankly she was not enjoying the hike as much as she had hoped. So, we will detour to Blairsville to drop the car and Tonto. She will drive Brewha to Hot Springs on Monday or Tuesday. Brewha needs to exchange tents, sleeping systems, etc. from our two-person configuration to a solo one. Monday morning at 1:53 it started. Tonto got the flu. All day Monday and most of Tuesday she was down and out. Finally Tuesday night she felt better and we decided to head to Hot Springs Wednesday morning. Not to be. Tuesday night, Brewha spent the evening hugging the porcelain idol. Wednesday he slept most of the day and Thursday he began to feel better. Bottom line, we anticipate being in Hot Springs Friday morning for Brewha to continue the journey. We had planned to be off trail for 3 days, but it turns out it will be 7 days if they can get out of Blairsville on Friday. On the bright side, it would have been a bummer to deal with flu symptoms on trail. If all goes as planned, Brewha will be walking north out of Hot Springs sometime Friday morning.

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532001,"The hike out of Hot Springs began at 10:40 AM after Tonto dropped me at the trail. It was bitter sweet starting without my sole mate, but one must do what one must do. It was a climbing day going from 1326 to 3538 elevation. Made good time and set up a sleeping spot in the shelter at around 5:30.The view back into Hot Springs and the French Broad River was spectacular. I heard, then saw a wild turkey fly into the woods. They are so noisy, he actually startled me. They fly poorly as well and this Tom hit more than one branch as he took flight. Later as I was trying to find a lunch spot it began to rain which ultimately turned to a hail storm. The ground was covered with pea-sized nuggets. Didn't hurt too bad. Lots of wild Trillium flowers along the way.If you recall, this section of the trail was closed due to fires when we left a week ago. The hike today went right thru the burn out and it was very wide spread. The trail maintainers were out doing repairs and found a log still burning. I was given a Snickers bar from one of the workers. Guess he thought I needed it more than he.I met a hiker at the shelter from Lima Ohio. He is a dentist and went to OSU dental school with my cousin. Small world.So I decided to set up in the hiker shelter. It looked like rain and I did not want to get the tent wet cause it's a haste to pack a wet tent. I generally fear snoring and other sleeping habits but decided to take a chance. We had mice invade the shelter and they chewed way sounded like a plastic container. It was loud and constant. Bottom line, not much sleep to be had. Furthermore, it was COLD!Still living the dream!

I got a late start at 7:30 and decided to do a cold breakfast of Pop Tarts. Two pastry treats and a couple swigs of water and I was off to tackle a 15 mile day. The route was to be challenging with several long climbs. The last 6.8 miles were rolling to flat according to my guide book. This is where I really miss Tonto. She would have said, you did a difficult day yesterday, and you are just getting over the flu, eat more food. Well needless to say, she was sitting in her recliner eating Bon Bons in Blairsville. Anyway, not more than 2 hours into my day I was feeling week, 4 hours in and I was bonked. No energy to climb even the reasonable inclines. It made for a long and miserable day. At the top of the major hill there appeared a sign. It was a lovely sign advertising trail majic at Jones Meadow. Just what this wonked hiker needs, hamburgers, hotdogs, and the works. Greenville TN hiking club put out a spread. In addition to grilled meats, they had banana pudding, posta salad, tossed salad, cake, popcorn, and every imaginable munchie. And, they had chairs! Eureka! I spend over an hour eating everything I could find. Best of all it was only 5 miles to my destination and the guide shows it as relatively flat. I waddled out of trail magic feeling stuffed. What I did not realize was the trail was steep ups followed by steep downs followed by a major rock scramble along a high ridge. My trail magic was now becoming a lead weight in my gut. Just can't catch a break today. AI stumbled into camp, pitched my tent, and crashed before 7:30. During the night we had extreme winds and light rain. No worry, I slept like a baby until daylight.

The shelter was on a ridge at 4,300 feet above sea level. We had some rain, but not enough to wet the ground. Got up at 6:30 and got the tent down right away for fear of more rain, but it never materialized, thank goodness. Prepared a dehydrated egg dish Tonto had created to energize my day. No more light, quick morning meals.The hike was enjoyable with lots of roller-coaster hills and one long climb. Made it into Hogback Ridge Shelter around 4:30 and set up the tent to dry. Headed to the spring for water. It was a mud hole with little flow. I managed to get 2 liters for cooking and the hike out in the morning. The harvest process is fairly simple. I fill a 2 liter heavy-duty plastic bag with spring water, attach a small cylinder filter 3 inches long and 2 inches in circumstance to the bag and drain the water through the filter into water bottles. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes. Filling the bag, which is fitted with a soda bottle-sized opening (think plastic coke bottle opening) can be challenge. I managed to fill enough in the mud pit to get me by.The privy was interesting as well. The pit had three walls no more than 3 feet wide surrounding it. The fourth side was open with a fantastic view across the valley. A very inspiring place from which to ponder the events taking place in the world today.Lasagna for dinner and in the rack, or should I say on the ground for a good night's rest.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Had a breakfast of instant mashed taters mixed with chunks of Spam. Now I know that may not sound appetizing to some, but it is really pretty good. It is a matter of taste. For example I watched a guy the prior night prepare a Ramen Noodle, hot source, peanut butter, olive oil, and cheese casserole that truly caught my imagination. He offered a bite, but I did not want to intrude on his masterpiece.This was one of those days that define what hiking the trail is about. It was a very pleasant trail with plenty of elevation gain, but we crossed over three balds with 360 degree views. Big Bald was at 5,516 foot elevation. I don't mind carrying my sorry butt up that hill when the views provide such a reward. As I was sitting in the grass peering out into the distant mountains I was reminded of friends at EIS, my former employer. At EIS there are a good number of bald-headed dudes. I wondered if a bug sitting on one of those bald heads had the same awe-inspiring feeling looking out from their perch as I did sitting on Big Bald. Time to move on!Today I enjoyed mile after mile of white flower filled wooded area. The small blooms provided a sweet treat for thousands of bees buzzing around collecting pollen. As I crossed a saddle I met a lady sitting on a fallen log enjoying her lunch. Her trail name is Mariposa (Butterfly in Spanish). She is from Arizona. She and her husband are hiking in a unique style. He drops her at the trail and then he drives 50 miles or so up trail. He drops the car and begins hiking south to meet her 2 or three days out. They then hike the rest of the way north together. She hikes the entire trail and he hikes both North ants Southbound for half the trail. She and I enjoyed eating dinner together at Whistle Gap.Tomorrow I arrive in Erwin, TN and if all goes well, Tonto will be there to great my smelly, grimy self and i will take a zero day to catch up, do laundry, and maybe even shower.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Again, going down steep inclines is not as much fun as it should be, in fact I may even say it is more painful than a climb. Not whining, but wow did my knees sing by the time I arrived in the valley.The beauty through this section continues to capture me by surprise. You just don't know what flower, waterfall, or gnarly tree might be around the next turn. In this remote area cell coverage is spotty at best. I had gotten a call through to Tonto a couple days ago with a rough plan for our rendezvous in Erwin. Now to be fair, Erwin is not exactly a major metro area, but basically I told her I will see you at Uncle Johnies around 1:00. But I could not get cell service for the past two days to confirm or alter the plan. At 12:30 I finally got service and called Tonto. She was enroute with a 1:00 ETA.

My destination for the day is a Hiker Hostel on Route19E where I had sent a resupply box. Think I will bunk up there for the night.Weekends bring out a lot of day hikers and short section hikers. I saw no less than 3 Scout Troups and at least 10 day hikers. The trail was tough, but the fierce winds continued especially at higher elevations. We crossed Jane Bald at 5790 feet and I finally shed my fleece jacket. It was sunny but windy. Just after lunch the skies clouded up. I was climbing Hump Mountain and it was so windy, cold, and rainy I thought sure I was in for a soaking. Just as I turned into an open field I saw the scout lying in a small ditch with an adult standing near. He was too tired to climb and the leader appeared to be exhausted as well. I offered them food but they had plenty. About 1/4 mile up the trail sat the rest of the troup waiting on their buddy. Two were headed back down to help. I guess they made it over the bald OK but not without teamwork.So it did rain just enough to get my rain gear out but most of all it was cold and windy. By the time I got to the hostel at 4:00 I felt like the scout lying in the field. Bad news...all bunks are sold in the hostel. Good news...they have one room with a king sized bed in the B&B.

The pinnacle was a fresh baked, home-made apple pie. Now I am talking crust, filling, that almost were as tasty as Tonto's famous Dutck Apple. I ate so much good food that I was able to hike all day with only one small snack. It was an apple of a day.The hike was perfect.

It was 36 degrees when I checked at 6:30 and again I was wearing every piece of clothing I had to stay lukewarm. It's one of those things where once you get moving you warm up, but that first step is sure a challenge. I broke camp, retrieved my food bag from the tree from which it was hanging, choked down a couple breakfast bars and some trail mix then headed north. The trail went uphill the first couple of miles and I stripped off layers as I climbed. By the time I reached the top (of this climb) I was down to my normal shorts and a tshirt.I crossed a road and entered Laurel Falls. This area is obviously popular with local hikers as the trail was manicured and well defined. The trail follows a stream for about a mile and then it drops below the trail and eventually you loose sight of it. That is when the fun begins. A steep decent on rocks leads to the falls. I would estimate a 50 foot drap or more. There are notices posted not to swim, but apparently folks in these parts don't read signs. Several memorials were sighted noted how people died from jumping the falls. Oh that testosterone rush! The trail skirted the river and at one point we edged along a stone cliff on a trail no more than 18 inches wide. A real stroll in the park.Finally I sighted a side trail to Hampton and a mile later found the brown Subaru waiting for me. I am digging this fine service Tonto is providing.

At one point we crossed a bog area that had 8 to 10 footbridges. Good thing cause without them it would have been a very wet trek. I descended from the woods and crossed TN 91 only to enter a cow pasture with at least 30 bovine chewing on the spring pasture grass. They were obviously used to hikers as they absolutely ignored us as we passed within inches of them. Later, I arrived at US 421 and decided to rest a spell at a picnic table located in a parking area. A truck pulled up and an older gentleman hopped out to ask about my hike and chew the fat about life in general. This was fine because I could clearly see a hill waiting for me when I finished my rest. He wished me well and went back to his truck. He returned with a bottle of water and two packs of crackers.

So, after a lazy morning of reading, we headed up the road to explore. The town has a number of antique shops, and some interesting eateries. We broused the downtown and had a late lunch at Fireside Smokehouse. Great BBQ and a variety of homemade sauces to complement the pulled pork. We then happened into The Martha Washington Hotel and Spa. The original building was a private home dating back to pre-Cival War 1800's. It then was used as a hospital during the War Between The States. After the war is was used as a Women's College before it was converted to a grand Hotel. If ever in Western Virginia, consider a night at Martha Washington Hotel.We finished our tour with stops at Wolfhill Brewery and then Damascus Brewery. Enjoyed beers at each establishment; a fine Pils at Wolfhill and s fabulous Stout at Damascus. We returned to Abingdon later in the evening and enjoyed dinner, watching it rain, at the Peppermill.During dinner we decided to take a break from the AT for at least a week.

It just so happens we would be needing a resupply about the time we were near Front Royal.  Justification enough, we booked a night at Woodward House and mailed a resupply box there.  We planned to get up and out hoping to enjoy our time in town.  Unfortunately, we had rain overnight that continued into the morning.  Wet tent and damp gear seems to slow everything down and our early start was delayed to nearly 9:00.  Even though we were wet, friends who stayed in the Shelter had a terrible night.  It seems a young hiker stoned out of his mind wandered in around hiker midnight(8:00) and proceeded to talk jibberish and smoke in the Shelter.  They in turn got a cheap buzz and no sleep.  In the morning the guy headed down the trail after we explained were he was and which way to go. We hiked through a rain cloud all day and arrived in Front Royal soaking wet around 3:45.  The proprietor picked Tonto and me up at the trail head and agreed to take our German couple along to town.  We checked in showered and headed to do laundry and eat.  The proprietor was kind enough to allow us to use his Mercedes to run errands.  We enjoyed a wonderful spaghetti dinner at a local establishment and were back and in bed by 8:30.Brew was bummed when he realized the Indians playoff game was not available.  After learning the outcome, he decided he was fortunate after all.Tonto is a very happy girl tonight!","Manassas Gap Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579612,"Great zero day.  We had to relocate to the EconoLodge due to lack of availability at the B&B.  We have chores to do today.  First and foremost, dry out shoes, tent, and equipment.  I am hiking in Goretex shoes.  Great for keeping water out, but very difficult to dry if wet inside.  After stuffing with paper towels and applying heat from the room HVAC we got them nearly dry.  We hung the tent over the hotel balcony until the Manager busted us.  It was so cloudy/misty ihey were not drying well anyway.  We hung gear all over the room.  By evening we were good to go.A quick meal at a local Thai joint and the zero day was complete.  My feet got torn up hiking 3 days in wet boots.  A day of open air drying and cleaning solved the problem.  Let’s hope for dry weather tomorrow.","Front Royal

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579635,"The hotel advertises shuttle service to the trail head.  Missy informed us that the shuttle leaves at 10:30.  Way too late.  We had finished breakfast and a new person was at the front desk.   It never hurts to ask again, right? She checked with the maintenance guy on duty and sure enough he agreed to shuttle us whenever we were ready.  We were at the trail by 8:30, way better.  
The 13.5 mile day began with a 1,800 foot climb out of the valley.    The forecast called for clouds and 60 degrees. Maybe somewhere, but not on the trail.  Another rain cloud day with no visibility at the vistas. Bummer.  At least our boots stayed relatively dry and it was cooler than before.  A good day for a walk in the woods. We passed a 4.5 foot black snake along the way but no bears.  Four miles into our day, we entered into Shenandoah National Park.  We will be in the park through out the remainder of this trip.  The trail is well maintained and we anticipate a lot of people on the trail this weekend.
We arrived at the Shelter around 4:30 and learned of bear sightings. Signs were posted suggesting people not camp.  Tonto was about to experience her first shelter sleepover. It is Friday night and as you might guess several folks came out for the weekend.  We met two past thru hikers, earplug and ?.  We also met a father-son team, and a family with 2 young girls.  Our German friends also arrived and quickly decided not to tent.  The Shelter was packed.  Between the  snoring, trouser barks, and air mattress noises it was a symphonic night with little sleep.  It was a wonderful group of people and we thoroughly enjoyed the camaraderie.
Let me say a few words about our food.  We enjoyed pasta, peas, ham, and parmesean cheese Tonto had dehydrated.  Previous meals included lasagna, spaghetti, mashed taters with beef and vegetables, and Szechuan Chicken.  All were cooked by adding boiling water and allowing the food to hydrate and cook.  I can’t express how good these meals taste after a long day in the woods,","Front Royal

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579659,"Brew awoke at some point in the night to an unfamiliar sight.  The moon was actually visible and cast light into the Shelter.  Perhaps we will finally walk out of the clouds today.
After a cup of Joe and a delicious hot oatmeal breakfast we headed up the trail.  We got a good jump on the day partly because we had no tent to take down and pack.  We saw several tame deer along the way.  They stood no more than three feet from us munching away on nuts and vegetation. We climbed 1,000 feet over the first 2 miles then gave it all back as we approached our first Waystation in Shenandoah.  Skyline drive weaves through the park and along the way are convenience marts with gas, groceries, and a GRILL.  We rolled into the Wayside just before noon and met our German Couple and two others from Gravel Springs Shelter.  A hot cheeseburger for Brew and a Turkey wrap for Tonto.  A delicious blackberry milkshake rounded out our feast.
Unfortunately we had 8 more miles to hike or we would have stayed for dinner.  Out and up, yes an immediate climb of some 800 feet.  The trail continued to roller coaster the rest of the day. However the sun shown and we enjoyed beautiful vista views across the valley.
Northbound hikers warned us that our next Shelter had no water.  The last spring was 2.5 miles from camp.  We loaded up with 7 liters of water.  Each liter weighs 2.2 pounds, you do the math.  We labored into camp and were welcomed by our Wayside companions.  
This was our nicest day from a weather perspective and the trail was well maintained.  Although Shenandoah is anything but level, the rock scrambles and boulder climbs are minimalized.
We enjoyed a wonderful meal of Spicey Spaghetti before crashing at 7:30.","Gravel Springs Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579725,"It is not like we are unsociable, but when the students from The Ohio State University showed up at 7:00 Tonto and Brew had just finished dinner and were ready for bed.  Oh to have the energy of a 20-something again.  The group of 5 immediately took over the shelter and any earlier conversations halted as we watched them buzz around teasing and spending energy most of us could only reminisce of possessing.  They were still trying to decide who would sleep where when we retreated to our outpost (tent), and fell asleep before 8:00.  We looked forward to watching them squirm in their sleeping bags as we prepared breakfast early in the morning.  Not that we would take joy in banging pots and talking a little louder than normal.  What a disappointment, by the time we made way to the shelter at 7:00 the young Buckeyes were long gone.  Only a few old geezers remained asleep in the shelter and we doubt they could hear us at all.
Today will be our test.  We need to hike 15 miles to reach Rock Springs Hut, otherwise we stealth camp.  The incentive is to reach Big Meadows Lodge Monday in time to eat in the restaurant before our shuttle driver arrives at 1:00.  Food, the great motivation.  Three climbs greater than 1,000 feet each must be conquered.  We are confident.
The day was gorgeous, sunshine, slight breeze, with temps in the low 70's.  Again we encountered many day hikers, including a group from Tonto's home town, Canton OH.  When we reached our second climb to the Pinnacle Peak we took a break and watched climbers repell down the shear cliffs and climb back up again.  Looks like fun.  Lots of rocks and hills take their toll on the body, but we reached our destination around 5:30.  Dinner included mash potatoes, corn, and beef.  Off to bed around 8:00 after spending time with Mark and Leda from Germany. We exchanged email addresses and wished them luck with their future endeavors.
During the evening, the wind howled up the valley making a noise of a freight train.  We were warned of temperature change on Monday but little chance of rain.  The forecast was 50% correct.  Rain stated around midnight and quit about dawn.  Oh my, did it get cold!  40 degrees with 15 mile per hour winds.  Thankfully we have a short 4 mile day to Big Meadows Lodge.","Pass Mountain Shelter

Tonto and Brew Ha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579755,"Yup, there’s a change in the weather coming the older gentleman informed us as we approached the shelter last night.  “No rain but it is going to cooler” he said.  We listened as the freight train winds howled off and on all night.  They seemed to pause only during the rain showers we enjoyed.  Great, our last morning and we get to pack up wet gear in “cooler weather “.  No worries, a hot breakfast of eggs, grits, sausage and steaming coffee will fend off the morning dampness.  Unfortunately we ran out of fuel before the coffee was made.  Tonto enjoys her morning coffee, kind of gets her going (if you know what I mean).  When she heard about the fuel situation it was no big deal.  After all we only have 4 miles until we reach our destination, and the Lodge has real coffee and PORCELAIN.We took camp down quickly, loaded up our packs and headed south.  The trail was moderate with two notable hills.  We remained in our jackets most of way as the wind was biting.  Finally about a mile away from Big Meadows we warmed up up enough to shed the jackets. We entered the Lodge around 10:45.  The front desk welcomed us and allowed us to relax in the Great Room.  The restaurant was no longer serving breakfast we learned, but they begin lunch service at noon.  Coffee, we asked?  Sure, was the reply, next door in the gift shop.  My buy, I remarked and made haste for the gift shop.We had just finished our cheeseburgers when “Strings” arrived at the Lodge.  We arranged a shuttle with him back to Harpers Ferry.  He was quite entertaining with stories about his hike as well as others he had shuttled.  100 miles later we were checking into the EconoLodge.  A long hot shower, dinner and off to sleep.  We will ride Amtrak back through DC and then on to Atlanta.  My college buddy, Gary, will join us in DC for a late lunch, before we make our ATL connection.Great day.","Rock Spring Hut
