Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555203,"I attended the May 9-13 Appalachian Trail Institute led by Warren Doyle. This weeklong class is designed to prepare people to hike the Appalachian Trail. For all but the first day we had class in the morning and did short hikes on the AT in the afternoon. I was fortunate in my choice of dates because all the class members live reasonably close to me. This means that we have become friends and have hiked together on other parts of the trail since class. I learned a lot in class and have learned a lot on practice hikes since then. The week of these first hikes, which were in northern Tennessee and near Damascus, Virginia, appeared to be the peak of spring wildflowers. We saw whole hillsides of mayapple foliage and red trillium in bloom. We saw white trillium, a type of yellow trillium that I'd never seen before, blue violets, yellow-eyed grass, pinxster plant (a beautiful orange wild azalea), wild geraniums, showy orchis, fire pink, dwarf crested iris, and some kind of flowering wild magnolia tree. The night before the first hike I was so excited I could hardly sleep.",,Appalachian Trail Institute,"May 09, Mon",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555216,"I signed up to go on an Appalachian Trail Institute Smart Hike in central Maine, from Rangeley to Monson. This is a hike supported by a van that carries the group's gear. Driving to Maine I was headed right through Allentown, PA, where my ATI classmate Paul Iobst (Big Dog) lives. I contacted Paul and asked him if he would take me hiking on the rocks in Pennsylvania on my way to Maine. Paul and his wife generously took me in for the weekend, helped me organize my food, helped me shop for more food, and took me up some impressive rocks. 
Paul and I headed to the pictured spot near Palmerton and headed up the rocks. It was about a mile to the top. Some of the trail required the use of both hands and both feet. By the time I got to the top I was lightheaded, I think from not eating enough breakfast. The trail at the top of these rocks was flat and through grassy fields - not a challenge - so rather than continue Paul took me back to his house, where we worked on figuring out what additional food I needed for the week. 
Paul has hiked 2000 miles of the trail, and his wife Haunani has spent a lot of time and effort researching dietary needs and how to fulfill them with trail food. They are both engineers, so they started a spread sheet listing all the food I had. From that we listed all the food I needed to buy and made a grocery list. Then we went to a grocery store to get everything on the list. We spent the evening packaging the food in convenient packages for each day, so all I would have to do in the morning was grab the Day 1 package, pull out the breakfast food to eat, and throw the lunch and snack food into my day pack. 
I left their house the following morning feeling considerably more prepared then when I arrived.",,View Entry,"Aug 21, Sun",0

This ATI Smart Hike was to go from Rangeley, ME to Monson, ME in 8 days. We were to meet at 8 PM the night before the hike at the trailhead on ME 4 outside Rangeley. Part of the group had gone back to the White Mountains for the day to make up a section they had missed the previous week. When they hadn’t gotten back by 9, the rest of the group picked 6 AM as a start time. I set my alarm for 5:30 and laid down to sleep in the back of my car. I woke to the sound of pounding on the car window at 5:15. Warren had planned a start time of 5 AM. So I quickly dressed, got my day pack out of the support van, ate a bit of breakfast. I headed out shortly after 5:30. 
This series of Smart Hikes covered the sections from the White Mountains to Mt. Katahdin in four sections. Everyone else in the group was doing all four hikes. Two were finishing section hikes, one after four years of hiking, one after ten, and one was finishing a thru hike he had started in February. I was the only inexperienced hiker in the group. Steve Bussey offered to hike with me for the day. Although his hiking speed was faster than mine, he stopped at each tricky spot to help me figure out how to get up or down. This was immensely helpful, as I’d had no experience with this type of steep, rocky, rooty terrain.
The hike was the hardest physical labor I’ve ever done. The entire day was a series of uphills and downhills, most of them quite steep. On uphills I held onto trees and pulled myself up; on downhills I sat on rocks and slid down, hanging onto trees to brake my descent. Near the top of Saddleback there was an enormous steep granite boulder with nothing to hold onto. Steve said to lean forward so the weight of my pack would help propel me up and just keep walking. It worked. At one place an iron ladder was leaned against a rock to help in the climb. 
The effort was definitely worthwhile. The views from the top of Saddleback Mountain (elev. 4120), The Horn (elev. 4032), and Saddleback Junior (elev. 3655) were astonishingly beautiful. We passed several pretty ponds and forded one stream. The day ended on a steep 2-mile uphill. By then I was exhausted. I concentrated on keeping a steady rhythm and eventually popped out of the woods at Perham Stream Logging Road about 7:30 PM. We had hiked 15.6 miles in 14 hours. We walked a mile and half east on the grassy abandoned road to reach our camping spot. By the time we arrived it was 8 o’clock and totally dark. Someone helped me set up my tarp, I grabbed something to eat, and was soon asleep.",,Perham Stream Logging Rd.,"Aug 24, Wed",0

It was still dark when I got up, and it took quite a while to take down my tarp, organize my other bins, and get ready to go. We left later because we were going a shorter distance, 10.5 miles. Our starting point on Perham Stream Logging Road is listed in AWOL’s guide as “not accessible by car.” The road itself is totally passable, but the entrance from the paved road crossing is blocked by boulders. So in order to get access to our gear in the van we had to camp near the road crossing. This required us to walk a mile and a half to get back to the trail. 
The hike was a steep 2-mile ascent to the top of Lone Mountain (elev. 3260), about 3 miles of relatively level trail, a steep ascent to the top of Spaulding Mountain (elev. 4000), a short steep descent and then a level section to Sugarloaf Mountain (elev. 3727), followed by a 2-mile very steep descent to the South Branch of the Carrabassett River. I started the day with big blisters on the inside bony part of each foot. Although I taped the blisters, they still hurt. I realized that my hiking shoes were too big. This caused the front part of my foot to slide around inside the shoe whenever my foot wasn’t level, which was pretty much all the time on this terrain. Fortunately, I had brought an old pair of hiking boots and was able to switch to them. I had to focus so hard on just getting up and down the trail that I hardly took any pictures. 
The vegetation atop these mountains was stark: scrubby short evergreen trees with taller scraggly evergreens that looked like they’d been blown to death by wind. Although the day was pleasantly warm, I could imagine how severe the weather must be to create such a landscape. From the top of Sugarloaf Mountain I looked down on the ski runs far below. On one of the more level sections of trail a plaque affixed to a large boulder honored the CCC crews who worked to complete the Appalachian Trail in Maine from 1935 to 1939. Near the spot where the plaque was located a group of them completed the final link of the entire Appalachian Trail in 1937. At the time the trail was 2,054 miles long. 
Coming down the steepest part of Sugarloaf Mountain I reached the top of the place in the picture. (The picture is from the bottom, looking up.) Earlier one of our group who was hiking south had told me there was a very steep section coming up. When I got there I was utterly terrified. It was all extremely steep, and there were no trees to provide a handhold. My first thought was, there’s no way I can get down that. My next thought was, no one’s coming to rescue me. Then, everyone else in the group got down; they figured out a way. I stood for what felt like a really long time figuring out a plan to get down. Finally, I picked a big granite boulder that was slanted steeply downward. I sat down, leaned back, placed my hands as far apart as possible, and gradually eased my way down, using my hands to brake, till one foot touched something and I could stand up.   
 Partway down, music started playing in my head. What I heard was “Lo-Slo Bluze”, a long track with Cat Anderson on trumpet, from the Newport in New York ’72 album. It had an amazing positive effect: it helped keep me calm through the scary place. So I’ll likely use this coping mechanism again. 
At the end of the downhill I came to the South Branch of the Carrabassett River. The water level was very low, so most of it could be crossed by jumping from rock to rock. A plank about 10 inches wide was balanced on two rocks on the only part of the ford that had water. Even days earlier I would have been scared to cross that plank, but after all the scary places I’d been in the past several days it was no big deal.
I got to our planned camping spot beside Caribou Valley Road in plenty of time to relax and set up my tarp before dark.",,Caribou Valley Rd.,"Aug 25, Thu",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555569,"Destination: ME 27, StrattonStart: Caribou Valley Rd.Miles: 8.8It rained lightly overnight. Despite the fact that my tarp was tenuously set up, I didn’t get wet.   Although we were hiking a shorter day, 8.8 miles, we still left early in the morning. This was so we’d arrive in Stratton with plenty of time to drive back to Rangeley to shuttle our cars forward. The hike was a 2-mile ascent to the top of South Crocker Mountain, about half gradual and half steep; an additional mile to the top of North Crocker, first a very steep descent, then a very steep climb; and finally a long gradual descent for about 6 miles to reach the trailhead at ME 27. I approached the top of South Crocker around 8:30, but as it was totally fogged in (see picture) I didn’t take the 50-yard side trail to reach the actual summit (elev. 4040). I made it to the top of North Crocker (elev. 4228) a little over an hour later. It too was fogged in. 
For a while there was intermittent light rain, but the temperature remained warm. So each time I put my raincoat on I became really hot and took it off. Finally the sun came out, and the day turned bright and beautiful. I got to the parking lot at ME 27 in mid-afternoon. There I experienced my first trail magic: a family was parked in the lot handing out ice-cold Powerade. Wow! That really hit the spot. 
Steve and I headed to Rangeley to pick up my car. My blisters were still hurting, so we stopped at an outfitter to get new shoes for me. After trying on quite a few, I settled on Keen low shoes. The deciding factors were that they had a large toe box and quite stiff soles. I figured the stiffer soles would be more secure when moving from rock to rock. (I want to avoid twisting my left ankle, which I sprained badly a few years ago. I may need to switch to higher boots in rocky areas.)
From there we headed to the Farmhouse Inn hostel, where we got showers for $5. I don’t think I’ve ever been so grateful for a shower. I’d been hiking really strenuously for three days in 80-degree temperatures, so I was very stinky — although probably not as stinky as my clothes. For the first day or so my shirt, made of synthetic material, just smelled like standard sweaty body odor. But after that it seemed like the bacteria creating the smell had fermented or somehow taken on a whole new life form. It was unbelievably rank. I too was filthy. My legs and arms were covered with scrapes, scratches, and dirt that had to be really vigorously scrubbed. It felt wonderful to be clean and to put on clean clothes. 
Next we headed to the Red Onion in Rangeley to get some real food. I wasn’t very hungry because I’ve been trying really hard to eat all my planned snacks through the day. Steve agreed to split a dinner with me. After that we caravaned in our separate cars back to Stratton. We stopped at a place where moose are sometimes seen, but we didn’t see any. 
The group met at 7 PM to plan the next day. Warren suggested a 5 AM start. The hike — over Bigelow Mountain, Avery Peak, and Little Bigelow — was the most difficult hike of this section, and it was 16.8 miles long. Warren bases his start times on his estimate of how long it will take the slowest person in the group to finish while it’s still daylight. His theory is that if you have to hike in the dark it’s better to do that in the morning when you’re fresh, rather than in the evening when you’re tired from hiking all day. I‘m the slowest person in this group. Looking at the AWOL profile and considering how long it took me to hike the first day, I thought I needed to start earlier, maybe 4 AM. Steve volunteered to start at 4 with me. Later we thought maybe 3:30 would be better. So we set our alarms for 3 AM and went to bed. I slept in my car again.",,"ME 27, Stratton","Aug 26, Fri",0

I got up at 3 AM, dressed, ate, and stowed my gear in the van. Steve and I donned our headlamps and headed out at 3:30. We crossed the paved road (ME 27), found the trail marker, and headed into the woods. It was a challenge to keep a normal pace in the dark. Not long into the hike I missed a turn and ended up off the trail. The trail in this section is well-trod and clear of undergrowth, so I quickly realized I was off the trail when I saw some scrubby undergrowth. When I got back on the trail I saw the reflectors on the back of Steve’s hiking shoes ahead of me. I continued on with Steve a bit ahead. Then I missed another sharp turn. Again I quickly realized my mistake and headed back. Again I saw Steve not too far ahead. 
The third time this happened I was off the trail a bit longer before I realized my mistake. When I got back onto the trail I didn’t see Steve’s reflectors ahead of me. I didn’t think anything of this though; I assumed he’d just gotten a bit further ahead of me. I continued on this flat part of the trail for quite a while. Around 4:30 I reached a paved road where a lot of cars were parked and some people were milling around. As I looked for the trail marker some people yelled, “Hey! Where are you going?” Focused on finding the continuation of the trail, I thought to myself, Why are those crazy people yelling at me? I found the trail marker and headed back up the trail.   
According to the AWOL guide, Cranberry Stream campsite was 1.8 miles into the hike. By the time I crossed the paved road I’d been hiking about an hour. Estimating my speed at a mile and a half an hour I figured I should see the campsite within half an hour. I started looking for it. A long time went by, and I didn’t see it. I began to wonder if I’d missed it or if I’d misjudged my pace. As the trail headed uphill I started to worry. I should have seen the campsite before the trail turned uphill. Gradually the sky began to lighten. As it did, I realized that the sun was rising on my left. Heading north, the sun should have risen on my right (east). It gradually dawned on me that I was heading south rather than north, and I’d been doing so for a long time. 
I sat down to think. I decided to keep hiking in that direction until I reached a trail marker to confirm where I was. By the time I reached the North Crocker Mountain marker, it was already far too late to go back to the starting point and head north. It was 5.2 miles back to ME 27. I turned around and headed back there. Near the bottom of the mountain I met two nice women from Massachusetts and stopped to talk to them for a while. I got back to the parking lot at noon. Words are inadequate to describe just how terrible I felt. I felt stupid, frustrated, embarrassed, and very disappointed at missing the day’s hike. The section we were to have hiked — over the Bigelows — is reputed to be some of the most spectacular scenery on the entire AT. Also, my budding confidence that I could follow the trail took a nosedive. 
My car was in the lot. I decided to drive to Bog Brook Road, where the day’s hike was to end, and wait for the group. This wasn’t as easy as it sounds. I didn’t have a Maine map detailed enough to show the small gravel road that was our destination, and I didn’t have any cell phone coverage to get directions from the internet. Finally I drove into Stratton and got directions from someone at the Stratton Motel. I got to Bog Brook Road around 3 o’clock. 
Not long after I arrived a hiker emerged from the woods. He introduced himself as Bruce. He said there was a lake nearby and invited me to go for a swim. We walked a short way to Flagstaff Lake and took a refreshing swim in water that was colder than I expected for this late in the summer. Afterwards we chatted about hiking. Folks from my group began arriving. The last person arrived around 5 o’clock. We sat on rocks at the edge of the parking lot and ate dinner. They told me I shouldn’t feel so bad about getting turned around, that it happens to everyone. Several people gave me strategies for avoiding it. The ones I remember are these:
Left off, left on/right off, right on: if you turn left to leave the trail for a shelter, etc., you turn left when you get back on the trail. This will keep you going in the same direction.
When leaving the trail, place your hiking stick on the ground pointed in the direction you’re headed. When you pick the stick back up, head in the direction the stick is pointed.
If you haven’t seen a blaze in 15 minutes turn around. I guess this would apply equally to reaching a landmark such as the campsite I’d been looking for. When I didn’t find it at the time I estimated, I should not have continued more than 15 minutes in that direction without turning around.
 On a positive note, my new shoes were great. They didn’t touch my blisters, so I had no pain while hiking. Not having improved in my tarp pitching skills, I again slept in my car.",,Bog Brook Rd./Flagstaff Lake,"Aug 27, Sat",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555643,"Destination: Road past Pierce PondStart: Bog Brook Rd./Flagstaff LakeMiles: 16.6        We appear to be past the most difficult part of the hike. The AWOL profile showed just a few small hills, the rest of the hike being gently rolling terrain between 1000 and 2000 feet in elevation. Because the hike was easier, I was able to keep up with some of the others in the group. I spent much of the day hiking with Ron Hall and Gene Anderson. Other than the first day when I hiked with Steve, I’ve spent most of the hike entirely alone and haven’t gotten to know the rest of the group. They hike so much faster than I do, and I’m too exhausted at the end of the day to do anything other than eat and pitch my tent. So it was a real treat to spend time with them. Ron, who lives in Alabama, does some kind of specialized surveying for a living. He’s been hiking the AT for 10 years now, using vacation time to hike twice a year. This is the end of his 10-year hike when he reaches Katahdin next week. He grew up in the northern panhandle of West Virginia, where his family has lived for generations. Gene is a retired business executive turned hippie. He moved from California back to Georgia, where he grew up, when he retired. He thru hiked the AT with Warren’s 2015 Expedition and is hiking from the White Mountains to Mt. Katahdin this year. 
 The three of us had wide-ranging conversation — dealing with elderly parents, genealogy, family dynamics, hiking, history, and George Washington. (Ron was reading a biography of Washington and has become a great admirer.) Gene told us he sometimes looks at items in stores and tries to figure out a hiking or camping use for them. He keeps a diaper pin attached to his backpack as a temporary fix for broken pack straps and the like.   
The places we passed through were interesting and pretty. The trail crossed several wetland areas, one of which has a brand new long boardwalk. We passed West and East Carry Ponds. A historical marker near there commemorates Benedict Arnold’s passage through there on his way to attacking Quebec City during the Revolutionary War. West Carry Pond was named this because it was part of Arnold’s route portaging between the Kennebec and Dead Rivers. The AT between Middle and West Carry Ponds follows the 1775 portage trail precisely. 
When we reached some suitable rocks we stopped to eat. Gene was able to text his hiking buddies from where we stopped. Ron showed me Guthook’s app, which shows the key landmarks on the trail and locates where you are in relation to them. It apparently can be used even when the phone is in airplane mode. I had no cell service there, as at most places on the hike. This made the Guthook app appealing. (I’ve been trying to estimate where I am partly by estimating my hourly pace and partly by checking the mileage on my Fitbit. I’ve learned that the Fitbit mileage is quite unreliable. By the end of a 15-mile day it will be 2 or more miles over the actual mileage.)
At one point the trail went right across a sandy beach. If I’d been by myself I would have stopped to enjoy the view, but I was so enjoying hiking with Ron and Gene that I kept going. Near the end of the hike the trail crossed a wooden dam across Pierce Pond. The wooden barrier felt rickety, so we crossed on the rocks behind it. 
We reached our camping spot in late afternoon, and I had my tarp set up by 6:30. This is the first time that the tarp has felt reasonably secure. All depends on whether I find two trees the right distance apart. I know there’s a way to use one tree and one hiking stick, but I haven’t been able to figure out how to do that.",,Road past Pierce Pond,"Aug 28, Sun",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555801,"Destination: Moxie Pond Rd.Start: Road past Pierce PondMiles: 15.5Today we crossed the Kennebec River. There are two ways to do this. There is a free canoe ferry that operates between 9 AM and 2 PM.   That’s the official route of the trail — a white blaze is painted inside on the bottom of the canoe. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the Maine Appalachian Trail Club strongly encourage hikers to use the ferry. A hydroelectric dam upstream releases water at unpredictable times, causing the current to increase and the water to rise to levels that make the river unsafe to cross. 
The other way is to ford the river on foot. Warren prefers this as the “traditional” AT route and says the river can be forded so long as it is done under safe conditions — that is, you begin before 8 AM, the rock bars and riffles 200 feet upstream are clearly visible, and you wear hiking boots/shoes to avoid slipping on the slick rocks.   Back at Flagstaff Lake he had surveyed the group as to which route each of us would take. He offered an incentive to those who forded on foot. The van would meet them at the road crossing on the other side with their dry shoes and clothing and take them to a place in Caratunk that has really good breakfast. He asked me first, and I said I’d take the ferry. (I don’t want to take any unnecessary risks. I’m old, and so far my body isn’t broken: no bad joints, no back injuries, etc. I’d like to finish the hike without any permanent damage to it. That’s why I want to hike the trail as a series of day hikes rather than carrying a heavy pack.) Steve immediately said he’d go with me. Ron and Gene said they’d ford, and Bill later decided to ford as well. They left at 5 in order to be at the river in time to cross before 8; Steve and I left at 6 to get to the river when ferry service started at 9. 
The trail began with a long gentle descent to the river. For several miles the trail ran parallel to Pierce Pond Stream, which was lovely and had a nice waterfall. These were the woods of my childhood — the same green mossy growth on rocks and fallen trees, the same plants (teaberry, bunchberry, clintonia/bluebeard lily), wildflowers, sounds, smells, and silence. I felt really at home and at peace. 
Steve and I reached the ferry crossing at 8:45 and sat down on a log to wait for the ferry. We saw Bill upstream, about halfway across, fording on foot. Then we saw him turn around and head back to this shore. He changed his mind when he realized that all the photos from his 6-month hike were on his smart phone and he would lose them if he lost his balance and got wet. The ferry arrived upstream from its usual landing place because the water was so low. I took the ferry with Bill, and Steve followed on the next one. 
From the road crossing in Caratunk the trail headed gradually uphill for 5 miles before becoming steep just below the summit of Pleasant Pond Mountain (elev. 2470). I reached it shortly after 2:30 and found Ron sitting on a boulder texting home. (Earlier I reached a sunny clearing and found him just getting up from an hour’s nap.) The view from the top was spectacular. It was a sunny day with a bright blue sky and puffy clouds that made shadows on the land below. I stayed a few minutes to enjoy the view and take some pictures. Most of the other mountain tops also have been very beautiful, especially Saddleback Junior, but I arrived at the top of them too exhausted to even think to take pictures. 
Ron left before I did and was soon far ahead of me. The rest of the hike was a gradual 5-mile descent to the road crossing where we were meeting the van. I was hiking alone and stopped to pick a few late blackberries, which were very sweet. After I’d been hiking what I judged to be 5 miles I started to get worried that I might have have missed the road crossing. I passed through a power line right of way, which I thought AWOL had located north of our stopping point. Then I came upon a woman who’d pitched her tent for the night. I asked her how far it was to the gravel road, and she told me it wasn’t far. Not long after, I reached our meeting place. I pitched my tarp between two trees, ate dinner with the others, and went to bed.",,Moxie Pond Rd.,"Aug 29, Mon",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555848,"Destination: Shirley-Blanchard Rd., MonsonStart: Moxie Pond Rd.Miles: 18.5When I woke in the morning both stakes at the front of the tarp had pulled out during the wind and rain overnight. The bottom foot and a half of my sleeping bag was wet. However, I didn’t wake through this and didn’t get cold or wet underneath the tarp. By the time I got up the weather had cleared. I stuffed most of my sleeping bag into its stuff sack and left the wet end hanging out, hoping it would dry in the van during the day.
Steve had a much rougher night. Ron got up to pee during the night. Steve heard Ron leave his tent and thought he’d slept through his alarm. He quickly dressed, took his tent down, and drank two energy drinks. Just then Ron came back and asked him why he was up at 1 in the morning! Steve set his tent back up but didn’t get much sleep because he was so buzzed on caffeine. 
We started early as usual. Although the hike wasn’t difficult, it was long — 18.5 miles. For the first 3 miles the trail went slightly uphill. Then there was a moderately steep 2-mile ascent to the top of Moxie Bald Mountain, followed by a moderately steep 2-mile descent.   The next 11 miles were very gradually downhill, with an uphill for the last half mile. 
I hiked with Steve to the top of Moxie Bald Mountain. On the way we passed through a place where boulders were piled on top of each other, and the trail went underneath the rocks. At one place we walked along a knife-edge big boulder following cairns, piles of rocks that are used as markers for the route of the trail. The top of the mountain had house-sized boulders and soft-edged smaller rocks with short scrubby plants and stunted evergreen trees. We reached the top just before 8:30. There we found Gene and Bill taking a break in the sun. We all sat down and had snacks, then took pictures of the views from the mountain and ourselves at the sign marking the summit. 
I was last to head out. At one spot I wasn’t sure where the trail continued north. I walked around on various rocks till I came to a cairn that marked the way. I reached Bald Mountain Stream at the end of the steeper descent shortly after 12:30. It was a lovely spot with bright blue sky, so I stopped to take a photo. I walked on a large dead tree to cross the stream and continued on the gradual downhill. 
 On the long downhill I noticed the my left foot had begun to hurt on the instep. It wasn’t rubbing such as causes a blister, but it was sore and had pangs of pain as though the shoe was touching a nerve. I’d heard that soaking sore feet in cold water would bring relief. So I stopped several times during the day to soak the foot — at Pleasant Pond near the lean-to, at the West Branch of the Piscataquis before fording, and finally in a small stream near the end of the hike. The cold water did relieve the pain temporarily, but it soon returned. 
For the rest of the hike I focused on keeping a good pace so as to arrive at our meeting place before dark. I met several southbound hikers on the way — a man hiking with his dog, a man taking a break at the West Branch of the Piscataquis River, and a woman setting up her hammock near the East Branch of the Piscataquis River. I stopped briefly to talk to each of them. Rounding one corner I came upon a man carrying full hiking gear but wearing only hiking boots and white men’s briefs. I did not stop to talk to him. (Later, back at camp, we discussed “underwear man.” Bill had asked him why he wore no clothes. The answer was “so I don’t get overheated”!)
I was looking forward to reaching the Piscataquis River because that’s my home river. I spent ages 5 through 13 in Dover-Foxcroft, and the Piscataquis runs right through it. It’s where I learned to ice skate and where I launched my first and only raft. The water level at the West Branch was very low. The rocks were slimy. A cable was suspended above the crossing so that hikers can grab it for support. I used my hiking stick to pull the cable down to where I could reach it, collapsed my stick, and started across with both hands on the cable. When I got about ten feet from the other shore I could no longer reach the ground. I wasn’t tall enough, and the combined weight of my pack and me didn’t weigh me down enough to reach. I had to pull out my stick, extend it, and carefully ease my way across the rest of the way without the help of the cable. The trail paralleled the river for a ways. There were high cliffs on the other side of the river. It was very pretty, but the bank was too steep for me to get close enough to take a picture. The second crossing was shorter, and I got across by stepping from one rock to the next. 
The last few miles of the hike seemed interminable. This was the farthest I’ve ever walked, and I was completely exhausted when I got to our meeting place shortly after 7. Warren picked us up in the van, and we headed into Monson to get some real food. By the time we reached our (illegal) camping place at the Lake Hebron beach it was totally dark.

It’s raining.” It was raining, but only lightly. Momentarily I considered just staying put. My tarp was covering my sleeping bag so it wouldn’t get wet. But then I thought of how wet I would get if it started raining harder. Ron set up his tent on the beach. I didn’t even try getting my tarp up. I have so much trouble in the daylight that doing it at night seemed way too hard. I gathered up my stuff and went to sleep on a wooden box in the van. 
Warren dropped us off at Shirley-Blanchard Road in the morning, and we headed north. It was a pretty and relatively flat walk. We passed two ponds, and we heard loons calling back and forth. At the top of the only hill we looked out on hills shrouded in fog. By the time we got to the trailhead at ME 15 the sky had cleared, and it was a beautiful sunny day. Warren drove Steve and me back to Stratton. Steve needed to shuttle his car forward, and I was leaving the group. 
Steve drove me to my car, which was parked at Flagstaff Lake. I was sorry to say goodbye to Steve — he’d become a real friend. Bruce, who’d earlier invited me swimming, had left a note on my windshield giving me his contact information in case I wanted to hike more in Maine. I was really tempted to call him to do the hike over the Bigelows that I’d missed. But I was due in Vermont the next day to visit my college roommate. I was at the end of the hike.",,"ME 15, Monson","Aug 31, Wed",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555882,"On the first day of my hike in Maine, my sister Diane posted a picture of me at the top of Saddleback Mountain to her Facebook page. One of her friends responded, “She'll return a changed person. Guaranteed.” I saw this and thought, a week in the woods couldn’t possibly make me a changed person. But in fact it did. 
The first three days of the hike were over terrain that was harder than anything I’ve hiked before. It required my complete concentration at all times just to move forward and avoid tripping over roots or falling on rocks. I had no time to think of anything except where to place my feet. Some days were a challenge because they were more miles than I usually hike: 15.6, 16.6, 15.5,18.5., these distances were a stretch for me: my normal exercise is to walk about 3 miles a day and a bit farther on weekends. 
The hike was a test: can my body stand up to the difficulties of the trail, and am I really serious about thru hiking? By the time I reached the top of Saddleback Mountain, on the first day, I knew I was serious about the hike. I was completely hooked on the spectacular views from the mountaintops and the peacefulness of the woods. By the end of the hike, I felt confident that my body could likely withstand the rigors of the trail. Although my whole body felt tired, nothing hurt and no old running injuries flared up. 
The last four days of the hike over easier terrain were wonderful. Most of the time I was hiking alone in the woods of my childhood — the same trees, plants, wildflowers, sounds, smells, and silence. Each day in late afternoon the woods became completely quiet — no bird sounds, no rustling of trees. I’ve never experienced such a silence. And I heard loons for the first time in many years. When I emerged from the woods at the end of the hike, my mind was quiet, and I had a profound sense of wellbeing and happiness. I felt refreshed and lighthearted, as though a huge burden had been lifted from my heart. I felt freer and happier than I’ve been in years. Perhaps having to concentrate so hard on a single task is like walking meditation. Whatever it is, I want to experience this feeling again.",,View Entry,"Sep 01, Thu",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555964,"Susan and Bill Hosaflook and I decided to hike the AT in Shenandoah National Park, starting at Rockfish Gap, about a mile south of the southern entrance. Our plan was to hike as far north as we could get in 4 or 5 days. Skyline Drive has many parking areas, and the AT crosses the road at many of these places. So it’s easy to hike sections of the trail by shuttling cars. We camped at Loft Mountain Campground and drove from there each morning.
We got to the park around 1 PM. I missed the intended starting place, Rockfish Gap, the southern entrance to the parkway.  So we started hiking at Mitchell Gap (Skyline 102.1).  The day was overcast and misty, the trail a series of small ups and downs. Skyline Drive generally runs along the ridge of the mountains, and this part of the AT parallels the Drive at slightly lower elevation. This means that most of the good views are at scenic overlooks on the road. So we looked forward to the road crossings. We hiked 6.8 miles to Sawmill Run Overlook (Skyline 95.3). Both Little Calf Mountain and Sawmill Run Overlook were fogged in, so our only view was at a power line right of way. 
After our hike we headed to Loft Mountain Campground. This is a nice facility. It has a store with food and supplies, a laundry room, and a room with coin-operated showers. There are bathroom facilities throughout the campground, with hot water. Once we picked our camping spot we headed back to the store building to get showers. What a treat at the end of a sweaty day! 
My hike in Maine using a tarp persuaded me that I’d rather have a tent. I never mastered getting the tarp up, and I hated dressing in a place where anyone could easily look in. So I borrowed a tent from my brother in law. It had a lot of stakes, and I kept hitting rocks, but I did get it up. It felt much more private than the tarp. Our campsite was very buggy, so I donned my bug net for the first time. We went to bed right after we ate.","Skyline 102.1, McCormick Gap (southbound)

It was nice getting to start the day with clean face and hands. The restroom facilities — and everywhere else in the camp — encourage careful disposal of all food waste. A sign in the women’s bathroom read, “ Do not throw food trash in this garbage. Bears will enter and be trapped inside the restroom.” There has been a big problem of bears coming to the campground to eat. We were very careful to dispose of our food garbage in the designated containers, but we also hoped to see some bears once we got on the trail. 
We aimed to be on the trail hiking by 8 o’clock, but we hadn’t counted on how long it would take us to shuttle the cars into place. We started where we left off, at Sawmill Run Overlook, and hiked a short way to Turk Gap (1.6 miles). Then we moved the cars into position to hike the section we missed at the south end of Skyline Drive. We started at McCormick Gap and hiked south to Rockfish Gap, just south of the park entrance (3.6 miles). Finally we picked a longer section and hiked from Skyline 84.3 to the trail to Loft Mountain Store (5.7 miles). 
The day started out overcast, and the woods were very misty. Occasionally there were places where the trail overlooked the valley and the next mountains, but most of these places were fogged in. Around 1:30 the sun came out. From there on we were hiking on smooth trails through light woods. We reached Loft Mountain Store in late afternoon. After we had showers we ate and planned where to hike next. We had hiked a total of 10.9 miles for the day, but we’d lost a lot of time moving cars. We decided to pick out a single hike of roughly that distance. We settled on Turk Gap to Skyline 84.3, which was 10.2 miles.","Rockfish Gap

Much of the hike was through lightly wooded areas on smooth, rockless, well-trod trail. The day passed uneventfully until we reached Blackrock parking area near the end of our hike. Not far from where the trail crossed the parking lot we came to an amazing sight — a huge pile of rocks above the trail. We followed the trail, circling the pile clockwise, till we came to a view overlooking the mountains to the west. This was even more amazing. The pile of rocks continued below the trail for a very long way. We stood and stared for a while, then headed on. We finished our hike for the day about a mile from there and headed back to the campground. A man in the campground store told us that the pile of rocks was a talus, a sloped area of broken rocks caused by repeated freezing and thawing. A truly impressive sight.","Skyline 94.1, Turk Gap (southbound)

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556507,"On our last day, we got some sunny, warm weather. While shuttling a car to Powell Gap we had a real treat. We saw a mother bear and two cubs. They crossed the road very close to the car. One of the cubs hesitated long enough at the edge of the woods for us to get a good look. They were moving too fast for us to get pictures though.
Each day this week we’ve met one or two southbound (SOBO) thru hikers, which surprised us.   Where we’ve been hiking is 840 to 900 miles from the southern end of the trail, so it seems late in the season to have so much trail left to go. These hikers will be getting into some quite cold weather in the mountains by the end of their hikes.   
The day’s hike was a series of small ups and downs in woods that look just like the woods at home in West Virginia. We started at Powell Gap and hiked through Simmons Gap and and Pinefield Gap. We’ve learned getting to a gap means hiking downhill into the gap and hiking uphill on the way out. We passed through one area that was extensively burned in the spring. The trail had been closed during the fire. In one area all the undergrowth had burned, and what remained was a ghostly forest of blackened tree trunks. Further on, where the area was more open the trail was surrounded on both sides by the types of weeds that grow in disturbed areas. 
We stayed together for the duration of the hike, chatting as we went. The hike sped by. We had time to stop at the Loft Mountain Wayside on the way back to the campground. I had a burger, and we all checked out the store. We left for home in late afternoon.","Skyline 69.9, Powell Gap

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556618,"This was the first prep hike I’ve done with the 2017 AT Expedition. We met at 5 AM in the trailhead parking lot at Turners Gap, Maryland. As the group is large, it’s subdivided into two groups. One group hikes northbound, leaving their cars at the starting point; the other group shuttles the northbounders’ cars to the end point and then hikes southbound to their own cars. Because the morning shuttle takes 30 minutes to an hour, the southbounders have less daylight hours to hike. Thus, the southbound group is primarily experienced hikers. Warren briefed us at the morning meeting at 5, describing the trail in general and telling us where our cars would be parked in Pen Mar park. The trail for the day was relatively flat, and we were meeting the van 23.5 miles away. This would be the longest distance I’ve ever hiked. 
We got on the trail around 5:30. It was dark, so we stayed together, hiking in a line until it got light. Not far into the hike we came to Washington Monument State Park, which had restrooms that were open. So we all stopped. The next landmark was Washington Monument. It was built by Boonesboro, Maryland residents in 1827 and later restored by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. It was still dark though, so we didn’t really get a good look at it. But we got a wonderful view of the town lights in the valley below. 
From there we passed into a wooded area where the trail was a dirt surface bordered by lichen-covered rocks on each side. Very nice easy hiking. There was a rustling wind like the sound just before rain. We were still walking together when suddenly we heard a loud crack. We stopped and looked up. Just then we heard a second crack very close by. I turned and ran full speed back down the trail. A large tree limb crashed on the trail right where I’d been standing! I had a delayed adrenalin rush of fear. I know each year a few people get killed by falling trees, but the number is so minuscule I’d never even thought to fear this. What’s the likelihood!?! As I hiked I calmed myself thinking, now that I’ve had my really unlikely close call, odds are that I’m unlikely to have another.
About 7 miles into the hike we came to a sign for Annapolis Rocks. Bill and I took the .2 mile side trail to check them out. There was a nice view overlooking the valley even though there were heavy clouds in some places. A large area on the south side of the trail was fenced off because of heavy environmental damage from overuse. On the side trail I came across my first composting toilet outhouse. Amazing! It didn’t smell. 
This part of the AT is near densely populated areas, so we crossed several roads, hiked through a residential neighborhood, and crossed I-70 on a pedestrian bridge. The AT crossed continuous fields of lichen-covered rocks farther into the hike. At the top of one hill we came to an unusual wall. It was about 4 feet thick, 4 feet deep, and 30 feet long. A notch was cut through it for the trail. When we got to the bottom of the hill we forded Little Antietam Creek. The wall’s proximity to it made me suspect that perhaps the odd wall was a battlement left from the Civil War. 
We got to Pen Mar around 7 PM. I found my car parked in the lot near the park entrance, where Warren had told us it would be. I ran into Scott and Arlene, and we headed to town for pizza. On the way back I stopped to get gas, so I lost track of where they went. When I got back to the parking lot it was empty. I knew this couldn't be right, so I drove up and down the road outside the park looking for the group. I didn’t find it. I had Arlene’s email address, so I emailed her. She didn’t respond. The only person whose phone number I had was Warren, so I called and texted him several times. He didn’t respond. So I settled down in my car and went to sleep.","Turner's Gap, US Alt 40

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556698,"I woke to the alarm, got dressed, and ate breakfast — really disheartened. I didn’t have phone numbers for anyone in the group, and it was clear that Warren wasn’t going to respond. So I figured unless I accidentally ran across the group I’d have to go to Caledonia State Park and miss the day’s hike. Shortly before 6 I drove out of the park and immediately saw headlamps in a field straight ahead. The group had car camped in that field overnight, but I never saw them the night before because of the dark. I pulled my car in and joined the group. Apparently Warren had told them an alternate place to park, in case the park gates should close, but I didn’t hear it. Arghh! I felt both stupid and angry. We again left in the dark. The profile for the day showed only long gradual ups and downs, nothing that looked too steep. The day was cool and misty, so we put our rain jackets on and took them off many times during the day. The first time we stopped it was still dark. I turned to my left and discovered I was standing on the Mason Dixon line. Had we not stopped to take off our jackets we would have walked right by. One of the hazards of hiking in the dark. While we were stopped Bill, Arlene, and I exchanged phone numbers. 
After a while Arlene headed out at a faster pace, and I hiked with Bill for the rest of the day. A substantial part of the hike was on a wooded ridge covered with rocks, sometimes in great piles and sometimes scattered around. The mist and the lichen-covered rocks reminded me of Matthew Brady’s Civil War photos of dead soldiers lying in places like this. It was eerie. 
Bill and I arrived at Caledonia State Park around 6. We found some cars from our group but no people. We figured they’d gone into town to eat. We both had plenty of snacks left from the day, so we sat at a picnic table and ate. As we were loading our packs into our cars a park ranger came along and told us overnight parking wasn’t allowed here. There was a place to park nearby, and he gave us directions to get there. Since we now had Arlene’s phone number, we called her to tell her where the group needed to go to park overnight. Bill and I headed out to look for it but had a hard time finding it. By the time we got there the rest of the group was there settling in for the night.","Pen Mar County Park

We were to end the day at Pine Grove Furnace State Park. This is the site of the half-gallon challenge: hikers try to eat a half gallon of ice cream to celebrate reaching the halfway point on the trail. None of us planned to do the challenge, but we were highly motivated to get to the Pine Grove General Store before it closed at 5. It’s reputed to have excellent burgers and milkshakes. I started off hiking with Bill and Arlene. Both had very sore feet from the day before. Before we reached the top of the initial hill Arlene told us to go ahead. Bill and I continued together. Two miles into the hike we passed Quarry Gap Shelters, right beside the trail. These have a caretaker on site and are decorated with hanging baskets of geraniums. Quite civilized. 
Half a mile further we came to a 5-way intersection of gravel roads at the top of the hill. Scott was there taking a short break. He planned to speed up so as to get to Pine Grove Furnace in time to eat at the general store. After some discussion I continued with Scott. Bill continued at his slower pace, saying he could hike with Arlene. Scott and I took off at a faster pace. It was not hard on this relatively easy terrain. We spent the rest of the hike talking and getting to know each other. We kept up a good pace and only stopped to take pictures once — at the AT halfway sign. 
Midday we came to a road crossing where Warren and Cam, a member of our group, were parked. Since Cam wasn’t hiking he had bought sub sandwiches, juice, and fruit as trail magic. Another meal of real food! So good! We got to Pine Grove Furnace shortly after 3. The burgers, fries, and milkshakes at the general store were every bit as good as their reputation. Rennie and Joe, both ultramarathoners, had had already finished hiking (south), shuttling their cars, and eating. They were sitting outside the general store in the sun. 
By 5 o’clock everyone except Bill and Arlene had arrived. We decided to get rooms in the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel. Thirty dollars there gets you a bed, shower, wifi, and breakfast in a refurbished elegant mansion. By 6 o’clock we had all showered and eaten, but there was still no sign of Bill and Arlene. We tried calling them, but cell coverage was intermittent and we couldn’t get through. At 7 it started raining really hard. Then it got dark. We began to get worried. At 7:45 Cam and I decided to drive to where the trail meets the road to wait for them. It continued to rain hard. I felt really guilty leaving Bill to hike alone. Finally, about half an hour later we saw headlamps approaching on the trail. Bill and Arlene were hiking together and were in good spirits despite being drenched. We offered them a ride back to the hostel (about half a mile), but they refused. Arlene said, “We’re already totally wet, and if we don’t hike it tonight we’ll just have to do it in the morning.” 
When they finally arrived someone in the group had gotten a room for Bill, who hadn’t been planning to stay there; someone else had gotten them both takeout dinner. I was really heartened to see the cooperative nature of the group. It seems like we’ll really work together as a team on our thru hike.","Caledonia State Park

The hike started with a 3-mile uphill, and the day was quite warm, so I was soon down to a single layer of clothing. Susan and I stopped to take pictures at Angels Rest. Approaching it we went through a big rhododendron thicket. There was still snow on the ground in a few places, even though the temperature eventually rose to over 60. At the top there was a beautiful view overlooking Wilburn Valley. We could see farms below with clear fields outlined in borders of snow and, in the distance, the next mountain. It was windy at the top, so we didn’t stay long. Sharon didn’t stop at all. I put my hat and mittens back on. 
After we got out of the wind we all stopped for lunch. Sharon had developed blisters on both heels, and Bill’s chronically bad ankle was aggravated. Susan and I went ahead at a faster pace. Coming up one hill through a rhododendron thicket I came upon three light yellow stinkhorns with gold-brown veils growing on dirt. Susan and I waited for Sharon and Bill at Docs Knob Shelter. From there Susan and Bill went ahead while I hiked more slowly with Sharon, who was in pain. After a bit Sharon suggested that I go ahead at my own pace and pick her up by car where the trail crosses the road so as to save her the half-mile walk back to the hostel. Susan and Bill finished the section at 4:00, I finished at 4:15, and Sharon finished around 4:30.

He decided to go the first three miles and then decide whether to continue. The plan was to have Michael drop us off where the trail crosses Sugar Run Road, we would hike northbound, and Michael would pick us up where the trail crosses VA 606. It was another warm day, already in the 40s when we started around 8 am.Susan, Bill, and I set off up the hill at a good pace. When we reached the top Bill’s ankle was doing fine, so he and Susan decided to continue on with me. The view from the top (elevation 3899) looking across the valley was interesting. We could see the valley below clearly, and wisps of fog were drifting up from low places into a big cloud that the covered the top of the next mountain. Above that the sky was blue with puffy white clouds. 
The trail continued along the ridge a ways, then descended steeply for about 3 miles and more gradually for the remaining 8 miles of the hike. Much of the way we hiked through forests of rhododendrons, which I really love. These forests seem exotic and make me feel like I’m in an enchanted forest in a fairy tale.         On the last part of the hike we crossed many footbridges. The AWOL guide, i.e., The A.T. Guide Northbound 2016, by David Miller, trail name AWOL, describes one point in this section as “the center of a one-mile stretch with at least 6 stream crossings by footbridge.” There were also numerous fords of smaller streams. We stopped counting after the twelfth bridge and remained clueless as to how far along we were. 
Then we crossed a woods road, and the habitat changed completely. We entered a forest of very tall deciduous trees, pines about 6 feet tall, and club moss as undergrowth. It was pretty and flat, and the trail was straight into the distance as far as we could see. For a long time we saw no blazes, but the path was very clear. Near the end of the hike we reached a side trail for Dismal Falls, but by then we were too weary to add another .6 mile to the hike and skipped it.
Michael was to pick us up at 5:30, but we realized we were quite ahead of schedule. So when we reached a high point with cell coverage we called him. He met us when we emerged from the woods at 4:00.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556911,"I met the other hikers at breakfast at 5:30. They were: Robin, a tall slim, friendly black woman in her late 40s; Vince, a short, muscular 73 year old from Massachusetts; Bob, a 40-something man from New Jersey; and Frank, a quiet 50ish man from Pennsylvania. They hike together often and are all working on section hikes of the AT. Vince has completed 1800 miles and Robin 1200. This should have been a clue that I was in over my head to hike with them. They planned to take their car to VA 621/Craig Creek Road, and hike north to VA 624/Newport Road, where Michael would meet them at 4:30. This was based on their estimate that they would go two miles an hour. I suggested 5:30, but they were all confident that 4:30 was about right. The hike consisted of a steep 2-mile uphill, a steep 6-mile downhill, a more gradual 5-mile uphill, and a steep 3-mile downhill.
I started off at their pace but was soon struggling to keep up. Not too far in Robin suggested that they wait for me at various spots. It was 34 degrees and very foggy. Nonetheless, I was soon down to one layer as I struggled up the hill. I took a 100-yard detour to see a memorial to Audie Murphy, the World War II war hero. The memorial is near where he died when his plane crashed into the mountain. I photographed the monument but only allowed myself to stop one more time to take a picture. I was in a hurry.
The second uphill had a lot of rock scrambling, and I had some trouble following the trail there. Sometimes the white blaze was painted on the top of a flat rock such that it could not be seen by either a northbound or southbound hiker unless they crawled up onto the rock first. It wasn’t hard getting onto and over the rocks, but finding the trail was. Coming around one corner I met a younger man with an older man and stopped to chat. The younger man had hiked the full Virginia part of the AT several times and was now helping his older friend do the same.
When at long last I reached the top, Robin and Vince were waiting for me. Around the corner was the downhill — a cliff with rebar and lots of carefully placed white blazes to direct exactly where to sidle along a ledge, slide down a rock, etc. The rocks were wet. As I carefully picked my way down, two young men, one carrying a boom box, came leaping down like gazelles. I was soon far behind the group again. There was a side trail to Dragon’s Tooth, but I couldn’t take time to see it because I was already going to make the group late for our shuttle pickup.
I caught up at the bottom because they were unclear whether Michael was picking us up at the road or at the Dragon’s Tooth parking lot. We eventually settled on the road and continued on. We arrived at the road at 5:10. Vince let me take the lead, and I hurried ahead to tell Michael that I’d pay for the shuttle in thanks for their being so patient with me. I felt terrible that I held them back, and having to hurry spoiled my hike. It made me too anxious to enjoy it.","VA 621/Craig Creek Rd.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556912,"I decided not to hike with the group. Instead, I did a shortened version of their hike, omitting the first 5 miles. Michael dropped them at VA 601/Rocky Gap, then dropped me 5 miles north at Sinking Creek/VA 42, and we all hiked to Craig’s Creek Road, where Bob’s car was parked. This was another warm (around 45) but very foggy day. My hike began with a 2-mile uphill. Not too far in I came to the Keffer oak. It’s the largest oak on the AT, a truly impressive sight. From there the trail crossed a cow pasture where, despite the season, I heard a bluebird singing and what sounded like chorus frogs. There was a steep uphill, then a 5-mile walk across the top of the ridge. There I heard pileated woodpeckers, flushed two wild turkeys, and saw 4 deer and a squirrel — the most wildlife I’ve seen in a single area of the AT so far.
About halfway across the ridge the terrain changed. The trail crossed some very scary rocks — slanted sideways at about a 30-degree angle with no handholds and a drop off to the right. The rocks were covered with pale green lichen which looked dry but was wet underneath — very slippery when stepped on. Every time I thought I’d reached the end of them more would appear. Picking my way across them added a lot of time to the hike, but I regard this as good training. While I was carefully crossing the rocks the sun came out, and I got a good view of the valley and the next mountain. It’s like the view you get from an airplane — long waves of hills like the inside of corrugated cardboard with side folds perpendicular to the top of the mountain — all very soft-edged. 
Finally despairing that I’d ever see the end of the rocks, I took a break, sat on a fallen tree, and ate lunch. Almost as soon as I resumed hiking I came to the north end of the ridge crest, which had a sign marking it as the Eastern Continental Divide. From there the trail descended gradually but with lots of rocks. I practiced rock hopping.
The last part of the hike was a gentle downhill on a pine-needled surface — very pleasant. I got to the parking lot at 2:45, having started at 8:15. It was altogether more pleasant not having to rush. I stopped to look at things and to take pictures all day. The others arrived about an hour later, and we drove to The Palisades restaurant for dinner. It’s an upscale eatery in an old hardware store. An old time band was playing. Frank was intrigued with it, apparently having never heard such music before.","VA 42/Sinking Creek

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556914,"This was the last day Robin and her group were hiking. Michael took us all to Rocky Gap, where they headed south. I left my car there, and Michael drove me to VA 635 at a bridge over Stony Creek. I hiked north alone.The hike was a steep uphill, 8 miles of small ups and downs along a ridge, a downhill, and a 2-mile steep uphill at the end. The trail started in a foggy rhododendron forest with moss-covered rocks and logs. I lost the trail one place where it took a 90-degree turn and I continued straight into a gully that I mistook for the trail. It took me about 10 minutes to find my way back to the last white blaze. Once there I looked down and saw timber log steps to my left where the trail turned. 
Much of the trail for the next 4 miles was on rocks.   Fallen trees and rocks were covered with bright slippery-to-walk-on green moss, and the woods were shrouded in fog. It made a dense silence: the fog and moss absorbed so much sound that I couldn’t even hear my own footsteps. At first this was peaceful, but after a while it began to feel eerie. Then suddenly I ascended out of the fog, and the day turned sunny and warm.         Just before I reached Mountain Lake Road I met Robin and her group of hikers coming in the opposite direction. Vince told me I’d be pleasantly surprised by how nice the trail was from here on. Indeed, when I reached where the trail crossed Mountain Lake Road the trail became a wide and even path through tall trees. It was sunny and warm there so I sat down on a rock and ate lunch in the sun. 
Shortly after I entered the Mountain Lake Wilderness there was a view to the west. Standing on rocks I saw the very top of the next mountain, but the entire valley was obscured by fog. The trail continued through tall trees in the sun. When it began to descend I practiced taking advantage of gravity to lean forward and tread lightly and swiftly downhill. According to Warren this will help avoid knee injuries form the constant pounding of down hill. Also, putting weight on the hiking stick transfers some of the impact from the hip and knee to the shoulder. I’m starting to get the hang of this and am now able to descend long hills with no knee pain, so long as the hill isn’t too steep, rocky, or rooty. It feels almost like race walking. The goal is to skim over the trail with little impact. 
I reached War Spur Shelter at the bottom of the hill about 3:30, later than I expected. The remaining two miles were steeply uphill, so I knew I’d be slow. Hoping I could hike a mile and a half an hour I estimated I’d reach my car around 5:00. I set off at a reasonably fast pace and soon came to a place where many trees had burned. Charred remains were littered all around. I took a few pictures and continued on, walking faster uphill than my usual pace. I was soon breathing heavily and stopping occasionally to drink water and catch my breath. 
These last two miles felt like five. Even though I was hiking fast I could see that it was a long way to the top of the mountain. Every time I rounded a corner I could see a higher part of the mountain. Then the trail turned into another mass of mossy, wet rocks. I had to slow down to avoid slipping. Five o’clock came and went, and I was still carefully picking my way up the wet rocks. 
It began to get dark. Darkness here comes around 5:30 at this time of year, but of course it comes earlier in the woods. I began to fear I wouldn’t reach my car before dark. Then I heard a gunshot, and another. I stopped instantly to put on my headlamp. I didn’t want to be mistaken for whatever animal the shooter was hunting. I became really scared.
At long last I heard the sound of a car, so I knew I was close to the road. (This in itself was surprising because the road was a fairly remote gravel road.) When I finally popped out of the woods at the top another car was parked there along with mine. I threw my pack into the car and took off, grateful to finally finish this long hike.","VA 635/Stony Creek

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556918,"I still needed to hike the section from Bland to VA 608, a distance of 18½ miles. Even through the AWOL profile makes it appear relatively easy, that distance is a stretch for me — given the number of daylight hours at this time of year and the late start time caused by shuttling my car. Michael suggested splitting it into two roughly equal days. We dropped my car off at VA 611, and Michael dropped me off the north end of VA 612.It was drizzling when I set out, so I made sure my down vest, hat, mittens, neck warmer, and fleece were carefully stowed in the plastic bag inside my day pack. To start I wore my wool base layer and my rain jacket with the hood up. Even though it was in the 40s, the fog and rain made it feel colder. I soon put on my hat underneath the raincoat hood.
The trail was relatively easy, with small ups and downs along a ridge top. At first the valleys on both sides were filled with fog. But after a while the valley to the east cleared, while the valley to the west remained fogged. As the terrain was relatively easy I was able to hike 2 miles an hour, and finished the hike around 1:30. 
I headed into Pearisburg to make some contact with the outside world. I don’t get any AT&T cell coverage at the hostel or up in the mountains. So I had a big lunch at the Mexican restaurant, checked my email, posted some pictures to Facebook, and called Diane.         I bought a tuna sandwich and some milk to bring back to the hostel for supper. After I ate I settled on my bed to write about this hike. My plan is to have written entries about each of my practice hikes so that Diane and I can get my Trail Journals blog set up when we get together at QuiltCon in Savannah, Georgia in late February.","North end of VA 612, Bland

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556923,"We left my car at VA 611, and Michael dropped me off at VA 606. All week we have left in the dark so I can start hiking as soon as it’s light. Every day I’ve driven my car to shuttle it’s also been foggy. Today for the first time it was clear. I started up the hill in sunshine. At the top of the ridge it was sunny and clear. Clouds above the valleys made interesting patterns of dark and light spots. Because it’s winter the sun was low in the sky with that special intense light. The trail was mainly small ups and downs on top of the ridge. It was easy terrain so I made good time. I started at 8:15 and finished at 1:15. The trail followed the ridge, which was narrow and wooded. There were great views of the valleys and farmlands on both sides of the mountain, although I was looking through a scrim of tree trunks. Had it been the normal hiking season the trees would have been leafed out, and there would have been no views at all. I’ve heard a lot of pileated woodpeckers this week, but today I also heard chickadees, nuthatches, and hawks. 
When I set out the temperature was in the high 40s, but it was quite cold on top of the ridge. There was a steady wind, especially in places where there were pines. When the trail descended even a little it was a wholly different feel — sunny, spring in the air, wildflower foliage coming up. The wind gave me a taste of what it must be like atop that ridge in normal winter weather — cold and very dangerous. 
I lost the trail again today, this time for nearly 10 minutes. I was hiking down a slight hill and came to Jenny Nob Shelter. Momentarily I thought it strange that the shelter was located so close to the trail. I set my hiking stick down with the tip facing north (one of my strategies for avoiding getting turned around when taking a break) and headed to the privy. Afterwards, I picked up my stick and headed in the direction to which it was pointing. I quickly came to a blue blaze. A trail marked with blue blazes is a side trail to the AT and not the official trail. So I was headed the wrong way. I went back to the shelter and saw another trail. I tried it and soon came to another blue blaze. Finally I oriented myself in the same direction as when I first saw the shelter and headed back up that path. It too had blue blazes, but I thought maybe it would take me back to the last place where I’d seen a white blaze. And it did. 
After about 100 yards I arrived at a signpost with mileages to the next road north and and the next road south. I headed in the direction of the road north and quickly came to a white blaze. I had taken a 90-degree turn, missed the sign, and missed the blue blazes the first time because the trail to the shelter was so well-trod that I had assumed it was the trail. 
Each time I do this I resolve to be more careful to follow the blazes rather than what appears to be the pathway. I always have a pang of fear when I realize I’ve lost the trail, but I don’t panic. Each time it happens and I figure out my mistake I become more confident in my own skills. 
Partway through the last descent the woods disappeared on one side, and the trail opened onto a wide open field. I stopped a minute to sit on a tree stump to enjoy the warmth of the sun. When I continued I saw hoof prints and cow flops on the trail. Cows are using the trail, too! A short way past this I heard the sound of rushing water, and the trail brought me to a substantial suspension bridge. It was sturdily built, suspended by thick cables. I could barely feel movement as I crossed. At the end of the bridge the trail continued to a a road. I walked about 50 feet and came to the small pull off where I’d left my car. 
I drove half a mile west to Trent’s Grocery for a hamburger, then headed to Pearisburg for some communication. I sat in the my car in the sun in the Food Lion parking lot and thawed out. I checked in with Diane, called Sharon to update her on the progress of the hike, and posted some pictures on Facebook. I was craving fruit, so I bought an orange and a banana to supplement my leftover snacks for supper. Then I headed back to the hostel. It’s a little lonely here as I’ve been the only guest for several days, and I spend the whole day hiking alone. Most days I don’t see even a single hiker all day.","VA 611

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556996,"This was another bright, clear, sunny morning. We left my car at VA 635/Stony Creek, and Michael dropped me at VA 461/Cross Clendennin Road. The first 2 miles were uphill through rocks but mostly not on them. From there the trail followed the ridge for about 10 miles through open fields with many pretty views, descended for 4 miles, with an additional 2 miles of small ups and downs along the creek. It was a beautiful hike. When I started around 8:45 the light was low and bright. At the top of the mountain there was a stile across a barbed wire fence and a large open grassy field. This ridge appears to be the border between West Virginia and Virginia. The view to West Virginia was of several ranks of mountains separated by farmland in the valleys. The trail continued through this open area, eventually coming to a nice view of the Virginia mountains to the east. After a time I came to an area that was still open but had widely spaced trees. It appeared to be an old abandoned orchard. I sat down on a rock and ate lunch. There were not many landmarks in AWOL’s guide so I wasn’t sure how far I’d gone. 
At 1:20 I came to a sign: Pine Swamp Branch Shelter was 5.2 miles. I calculated I still had 7.4 miles to go. I decided I should pick up the pace and headed downhill. Partway down I met Bob and Mary, who live nearby and are hiking the AT in sections. They plan to complete 100 miles per month and hope to do much of it without camping. I stopped to chat with them. They were concerned that I was short of time to make it to where my car was parked at Cherokee Flats and offered to come pick me up from a side trail if I wanted. I continued hiking down the hill at a brisk pace.
Near the bottom of the hill the trail passed through a rhododendron forest beside a stream with several places that had to be forded. I didn’t reach Pine Swamp Branch Shelter till 4:30. I estimated that I would get to my car around 6 if I maintained a pace of 1½ miles an hour. Not far past the shelter the trail reached the road, but a stream with no bridge separated the trail from the road. AWOL’s guide showed that the trail continued another 2 miles up and down small but steep hills before finally reaching the road crossing. These last two miles seemed to take an eternity: I was tired, darkness was falling, and I was anxious to avoid hiking in the dark. When I finally reached my car at 5:50 it was almost completely dark.","VA 461/Cross Clendennin Rd.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557210,"As of this morning, I had three more short sections to complete the 117-mile section of Central Virginia. Since they're short -- around 5 miles each -- I planned to have Michael shuttle me to two of these today. I awoke to a downpour that had been going on all night. Michael suggested that I just do one section, and I agreed. I've been away from home for 11 days, and I'm anxious to get home. The remaining 10 or so miles can easily be done later. We parked my car on VA 634 in Pearisburg, and Michael took me to VA 461/Cross Clendennin Rd. It was still raining when I started up the hill but not very hard. Not long after, the rain stopped, but the sky remained dark and threatening. After a short uphill the trail descended about 3 miles to a stream. A sign warned hikers not to drink the water because of the nearby landfill. The trail ran beside the landfill for a ways, separated from it by a chain link fence. About half a mile further the trail emerged from the woods at US 460, a major highway. Arrows painted on the pavement and white blazes on telephone poles directed me underneath the highway bridge, up some steps, and around to a pedestrian walkway across the bridge. From there the trail entered a scrubby area overgrown with kudzu vines, past a very old cemetery, and eventually out to Pearis Cemetery trailhead. Crossing the road I continued through a pasture and into the woods. I stopped for a while to talk to a local hiker who was taking advantage of a day off. The last part of the section was a steep uphill to VA 634.When I finished my clothes were stinky; my hiking boots and pants were muddy and wet. I headed back into Pearisburg. When I reached a Dairy Queen I pulled in. I got dry, clean clothes out of the car, went directly to the women's restroom, and stripped. Getting into clean dry clothes felt wonderful. As I changed I realized I'm getting used to the hiking life. It seemed totally natural to change my clothes at the first opportunity to preserve body heat.   After a quick lunch I headed home.I feel really fortunate to have had such unseasonably warm weather during the time I've been here. Most of the days it was in the 40s and 50s although humid or drizzly. It's really easy to get chilled -- even at these relatively warm temperatures -- if you take more than a short break from hiking. It's been an opportunity to learn just which layers to wear in these conditions. I've also been lucky not to have to walk in much rain. It rained all but one of the 11 days I was here. But most days it rained overnight or before or after I hiked. I spent only about 20 minutes hiking in rain during this entire time, and I hiked 107 of the 117 miles I came to do.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557747,"I drove to Narrows, Virginia yesterday to finish the remaining two short sections of the AT between Bland and Catawba, Virginia that I missed in January. I’m staying at the MacArthur Inn, a 1940s-era hotel named after General MacArthur. It now operates more like a bed and breakfast. On Thursday nights it serves dinner, and locals gather for an old time music jam. I arrived in time to attend. A man eating at the same table told me he’s a retired dairy farmer from Monroe County, West Virginia. It turned out he’s an excellent mandolin player. About 20 people played — guitar, bass, mandolin, fiddle, banjo, piano, and ukulele — and lots of folks listened. Today was a lesson in taking the trail as it comes and not having expectations of it. The weather forecast was for sun and 70 degrees. I had my mind set for a short, sunny, easy hike. A local shuttle driver took me to VA 42, to the footbridge at Sinking Creek. Everything we passed on route 42 looked familiar, but the parking place didn’t. Neither did the trail on either side of the road. My first thought was to check my AWOL pages to make sure I was at the right place, but I had left it on the night table at the hotel. So I left my car there and had the driver drop me off on VA 601 at Rocky Gap. I started up the hill a few minutes before 10. It was 45 degrees and overcast.
This was the same hill with wet mossy rocks that I’d been hiking in January as darkness descended and someone shot a gun nearby. The continuation of the trail across the road, however, was a wide, smooth dirt trail that was not very steep. I headed up and got to the top quickly. I was trying out some new gear: new hiking boots, new lightweight carbon trekking pole, and new daypack. In less than a mile the right boot started rubbing the top left part of my ankle. I stopped to untie and tie the boot several times, but nothing helped. It hurt. 
The trail at the top of the mountain alternated between small rocks and smooth dirt surface. I passed through areas with large lichen-covered boulders, bare deciduous trees, and occasional mountain laurel. About a mile into the hike there was a side trail to Kelly Knob. From atop a rock outcropping there I saw receding ranks of steep mountains to the left and a high, completely flat, long mountain ridge to the right. 
From there the trail started to descend. About 10 minutes later I noticed that the basket on my new trekking pole was gone. I turned around and headed back up the hill to look for it. I decided I’d only go as far back as Kelly Knob because I’d set the pole down there.   I figured I would have noticed the basket’s absence when I picked it back up. About half way back I found the basket and screwed it back on. I realized that I’d only screwed it halfway on when I put it together at home. 
I tripped and stumbled several times as I continued on. Then, as I was moving quickly, I stepped on a pebble that slid out from under me. I fell very hard on my hands and right knee, and both water bottles flew off my pack. I felt a strong pain that left me momentarily breathless. I sat there for a minute to collect myself. The fall left two scrapes on my knee, but they were clean because I was wearing long pants. They didn’t seem to be bleeding, so I got up and continued on at a slower pace. Soon I felt blood trickling down my leg, so I stopped and got out my first aid gear. I swabbed the scrapes with alcohol wipes, smeared on antibiotic cream, and covered them with bandaids. While I had the stuff out I put some tape over the place on my ankle where the boot was rubbing. By then I was feeling really out of sorts. I wasn’t getting the warm sunny day I’d been expecting, my right ankle was hurting, and everything about the hike was turning out to be difficult. I decided to take a break to see if I could dispel the terrible mood I was in. I sat on a log and ate a pear. 
At 12:30 the sun finally came out, and I sat down on a log to eat lunch. While I was eating I saw a hawk and a really tiny chickadee, and I heard chainsaws. Not too far past there I came upon a side trail to Laurel Creek Shelter, where two men were working with chainsaws. I didn’t stop to see what they were doing but continued on. I saw my first butterflies of the year — an orange one and two blues. About 2:00 I emerged from the woods, and the trail took me through pastures, with views of neat farmhouses and black cattle. I reached my car at 2:30. 
I crossed the road and walked up the trail a bit to see if it looked familiar. It didn’t. Momentarily I considered hiking on until I came to something familiar, then turning around. But I didn’t know whether it was one mile or ten. So I got into my car and headed back to the hotel. I took a shower and looked at the AWOL guide. I had indeed gone to the wrong road crossing. I should have ended at VA 630. The missing section of trail was .9 mile. It was only 5:00 so I headed back to where I’d just come from, parked the car, hiked the .9 mile to the next road crossing, then turned around and hiked back to the car. I got back to town at 7:00 and headed to a restaurant to eat. By the time I finally got back for the night I was absolutely exhausted.
What a difficult and frustrating day! None of the things that went wrong was very important, and all of them were fixed in the end. But my expectation that the day would be pleasant and easy colored all that happened. In the end, it was my own mind that made it such a hard day.","VA 601, Rocky Gap

I got up at 7:30, ate in my room, packed up my car, and headed for Four Pines Hostel in Catawba around 8:15. I had arranged a shuttle to take me to the trailhead parking lot at VA 311. It was an hour and a half drive to the hostel. When we got to the trailhead, the parking lot was completely full. So we dropped my car back at the hostel and me back at the trail where it crosses VA 624. I got on the trail at 10:15.  I had already shed my windbreaker by the time I headed up the hill and soon shed my fleece as well. Coming down the other side of the hill a runner passed me headed in the other direction. At the bottom of the hill there was a stream. AWOL’s guide said there was a footbridge there, but there was no sign of one. There was also supposed to be a stile, but that too was missing. Instead, there was the first of several V-shaped gates. These appear to be common in this area. They have no actual barrier. Instead, there’s a slot, a turn at an acute angle, and a second slot in the opposite direction. Humans can make the sharp turn, but livestock can’t. The trail followed alongside the stream, through a well-grazed pasture, across Blacksburg Road, and across a footbridge over Catawba Creek. From there it headed uphill through more pasture. In the middle of the hill two white blazes on a utility pole marked a turn in the trail. I looked uphill, and a black cow was gazing at me. I heard a rufous-sided towhee.
At the edge of the pasture the trail entered the woods and continued uphill to the top of a narrow rocky ridge. The rest of the hike followed this undulating ridge. It was a warm sunny day, and in open places I saw lots of early spring wildflowers in bloom: heal-all, corn speedwell, a tiny chickweed, lesser pussytoes, and a small yellow flower that we later identified as corydalis. When I stopped to eat lunch I was swarmed by some kind of bugs — a sign of real spring. I met three young hikers who had started past Tinker Cliffs, had already been to McAfee Knob, and were headed to Dragon’s Tooth. In the last mile of the hike there were lots of hikers headed south for afternoon hikes. 
When I got within view of the parking lot I called the shuttle driver to be picked up. He took me back to my car, and I headed toward West Virginia. I had gotten a cell signal on the ridge so I texted my friends Susan and Glenn in Lewisburg and headed for their house for a visit on the way home. We got out their wildflower books and identified the corydalis.","VA 624, Newport Rd.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559322,"This is my first night trying out my new camping gear and my first night blogging from the trail. We 2017 Expedition members are having our last prep hike before we start out in Georgia on April 29. I left my car at Pine Grove Furnace State Park and car pooled with my friend Paul to the trailhead at PA 325, our starting point for tomorrow.  I'm not an experienced camper. Before this, my only camping was in our VW poptop camper. It had beds, a refrigerator, a small sink, and a stove with two burners. This is definitely different!  I agonized over what equipment to buy. Till now I've been using a borrowed tent and sleeping pad and sleeping bags I had from about 25 years ago. I didn't want to be one of the folks who prepare for the trail by buying a lot of gear and then quit after just a few days. So I waited till I'd hiked enough of the trail to feel confident that I could do it before buying anything.
Tonight I pitched my tent for the first time. It went up fairly easily and seems securely up. It's a Tarptent Moment double-walled tent. The inside wall is a frame of mesh to keep bugs out. The temperature now is about 45 degrees, and it's raining. So far, so good inside.
I picked a Thermarest Sol Lite sleeping pad. It's closed cell foam with a silver-colored reflective surface. It's supposed to reflect body heat back to the camper's body and is very lightweight. When I sat on it to work on getting my sleeping bag zipped up I could definitely feel warmth. Again, so far, so good.
Everyone advised me to get a synthetic-fill sleeping bag. Synthetic bags insulate even when wet, whereas down bags don't.   But I wanted something really warm, something rated at 15 degrees, and I couldn't find any synthetic bag that warm.   (I know these ratings must be taken with a grain of salt, but even so. If they don't even claim to be that warm, then they probably aren't.)  Then I saw a survey at the Appalachian Trials website of what kinds of sleeping bags AT thru hikers used in 2016. About two-thirds of the hikers used down. About a third used natural down, and another third used down treated to make it more water-resistant. So I settled on a treated down bag from Sierra Designs. I call it my purple sleeping bag named Eleanor. I'm sitting in it now and am quite warm.
My other new equipment to try out is a bluetooth keyboard. My husband bought it for me years ago to use with my iPad, but I never created documents with the iPad and so never used it. I thought it would be way easier to have a real keyboard for writing my trail journal. And it is. It's a real luxury. Now I need to make a padded waterproof case to keep it in.
Last weekend I tried out my new hiking boots. The right boot rubbed the left side of my ankle and hurt. This week I took the shoe to a running shoe shop. They looked at it and said the gusset on the left side of the tongue was sticking inside the shoe at an odd angle. They suggested pulling the material to the outside and stitching it in place there. I did that and walked around in it for a few hours. It seems to be fixed. I'm going to try it on tomorrow's hike, which is 18.9 miles. I may stick a spare pair of shoes into my pack, just in case. 
Tomorrow will be a more substantive day, but I expect to be too tired to write much.","PA 325, Clarks Creek

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559324,"The group was set to meet with Warren at 6 AM and start hiking by 7, so I got up at 5 to eat and take my tent down. It rained most of the night, and it was hard packing the wet tent in the dark. I decided to give my modified new hiking boots a try. Warren wanted the group to detour to a Pilot truck stop once we reached Duncannon so as to hike together to our camping spot. Warren refers to this area as a ""safety zone,"" but what he really means is that it's a danger zone. Paul and I started hiking at 6:50. The hike started with an uphill, so we quickly warmed up. For the first three hours there was just a light mist, and we started thinking this wouldn't be bad at all.  
But then it started to rain and got quite cold. The trail was rocky ups and downs along a ridge, requiring us to proceed very carefully. When we reached Peters Mountain Shelter Paul and I stopped for lunch. Scott and Terri were there finishing their lunch; Bill, Arlene, and Lizzie arrived shortly after we did. We checked the temperature on the thermometer I have hanging off my pack. It was 35 degrees. No wonder we were so cold! My mittens were completely saturated and very heavy, although they still kept my hands moderately warm. I used the privy, which was very nice -- one of those composting privies that don't smell. Bill, Lizzie, Arlene, Paul, and I decided to stop for our next snack at the next shelter, Clarks Ferry Shelter.  
The five of us leapfrogged back and forth. Once while I was carefully picking my way across some wet rocks I saw Lizzie ahead. She had her hiking stick in her right hand not using it, and with her left hand she was cracking pistachio nuts. Generally I don't feel old, but this was a stark reminder that the 30 years age difference between us makes quite a difference in our hiking prowess.  
The five of us stopped when we reached the side trail to the next shelter. We were all so cold and anxious to reach our destination that we didn't go to the shelter. Instead, we stood at the trail junction and ate our snacks. Lizzie was fantasizing about drying some of her clothes using the hand dryers in the bathroom at the truck stop; I was hoping there'd be a laundromat where we could dry all our clothes. We hurried along. The trail turned steeply downhill into Duncannon. Much of the trail was just puddles, but occasionally there were places where a stream ran down the trail. The entrance to Duncannon was unpleasant. At the bottom of the hill we had to cross three railroad tracks, a highway with fast-moving traffic, and then cross a bridge that was about a mile long. The traffic noise from all this was very loud, and we could hear it long before we were anywhere close to Duncannon.  
The road we crossed to reach the truck stop was a five-lane highway with no median strip, just a turning lane. We waited quite a while to get halfway across. Then a really kind woman took pity on us and turned on her flashers so we could cross. Paul and I got to the truck stop at 4:15. The faster hikers had been waiting there since 1:15. Bill, Arlene, and Lizzie arrived about half an hour after us. The truck stop was a washout in terms of drying our clothes, but it had a Subway so we were able to eat real food for supper before continuing on our way. After we ate we got back on the trail, which runs right through Duncannon, and continued another two miles to our camping spot.  
The camping spot was a nice open field not far off the trail and relatively quiet. I pitched my tent, then realized that I'd forgotten my ground cloth. I took the tent down, and pitched it a second time with the groundcloth underneath. Once we got set up Warren took the folks who'd left their cars left at PA 325 back there to shuttle their cars to Pine Grove Furnace State Park, our end point.   While he was gone Scott, Paul, Lizzie, and I walked back to a laundromat we'd seen in Duncannon to dry our clothes. I took off all my outer layers and threw them in a dryer. This left me barefoot but with my wool long underwear top and bottom on. Once the outer layers were dry, I crouched down behind some washing machines and took off everything else. I threw the rest of my clothes in the dryer and put on my now-dry outer layers. I put on my warm long underwear once it came out of the dryer. (Later I learned that I'd undressed in front of a security camera. But getting into the dry, warm long underwear was definitely worth it.) There was a convenience store on the way back to our tents, so we stopped in there to brush our teeth and get ready for bed. I was settled into my sleeping bag starting to write a journal entry at 8:30 when we were interrupted by an unpleasant incident that I won't discuss here. I eventually got back to bed at 10:30. By then I was far too tired to write.  
Being cold is one of my top two fears for the hike. I feel like I passed quite a big test making it through the day in reasonably good spirits despite being very wet and cold. Doing this hike alone would have been utterly miserable, but doing it with a group made it bearable.","PA 325, Clarks Creek (southbound)

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559369,"I woke to my alarm at 5, then realized that our start time was 7, not 6. Paul and I decided that since we were already up we might as well go back to the gas station and have breakfast there.   We dressed and broke camp, all except taking down our tents. I left my mittens on my tent floor to give them a few more minutes to dry out. I put my toothbrush and toothpaste in my pocket, and we headed out. At the gas station I bought a large coffee (heavenly after days of cold coffee or none at all) and a 2-pack of Pop Tarts. After we ate and brushed our teeth we headed back to the campground. We took our tents down, stowed them in the van, and were on the trail hiking before 7 o’clock.  The forecast was for an overcast and cold day, and the day turned out as promised. The climb out of Duncannon was steep. The hillside was littered with rocks, and the stone steps that were the trail were barely distinguishable from the surrounding hillside. By the time we got to the top of the ridge we were warm. The trail followed the ridge for about 5 miles, then undulated in small waves for the next 5 miles. We reached Darlington Shelter, about half way, around 1:30. Not long after, Bill, Arlene, and Lizzie arrived. As soon as we stopped moving I became cold. I needed my mittens and remembered that I’d left them inside my tent when I took it down. We ate lunch and tried to warm up. Lizzie had some hand warmers and gave me one.  The five of us left around 2:00, headed downhill. I clutched the hand warmer in my left hand, and my hand gradually warmed up. As soon as my left hand got warm, the right one did, too. I’m not sure how this works, but it’s good! The sun peeked out from behind the clouds for about 15 minutes.  Momentarily I felt lighthearted, but then it disappeared again.  Paul and I decided to pick up the pace to take advantage of the downhill and flat sections. We wanted to reach US 11 at Carlisle in time to eat at a diner that was .3 mile off the trail. This part of the trail was not pretty. In places we crossed lots of rocks. Other sections were in narrow, scruffy corridors of woods through residential neighborhoods. Several sections were road walks near busy and noisy highways. There was an elegant underpass for one of these, a pedestrian bridge over another. But on another we had to cross a bridge in the breakdown lane of a busy road. Scary! We also passed through lots of farm fields - very pleasant. And we saw several types of wildflowers in bloom or nearly ready to bloom — cut leaf toothwort, Virginia bluebells, buttercups, and round loped hepatica (white, rather than the blue I see in West Virginia).  We reached US 11 around 4:45. We sat on the edge of the pedestrian bridge to calculate whether we had time to go to the diner. Reluctantly, we decided we didn’t. We still had 4 miles to our planned stopping point. While we were stopped, the faster hikers — Rennie, Patti, Terri, and Scott — arrived from the diner. They reported that the food was good. Paul and I finished our snacks and continued at a good pace through farm fields. In the corner of one field, at the edge of the woods, was a very old cemetery. The death dates on the grave markers predated 1810! We didn’t stop long but continued at a good pace.  Emerging from a section of woods we saw the white van pull away at the other end of the cornfield. Scott was waiting for us at the AT parking lot and kiosk at Trimble Road, our planned stopping place. Considering the previous night’s difficulties, Warren had decided that it would be more discreet to continue to Lisburn Road to camp, a location where we’d be shielded from view of the road by woods. This was another mile further. By the time we got our tents pitched at Lisburn Road it was 8 o’clock and totally dark and cold. I took some food from my bin and ate inside my tent in my sleeping bag. I got out my spork but immediately lost it. So I ate my tuna and lemon pudding out of the containers by squeezing them into my mouth. I was way too tired to write a journal entry.","Sherman Creek Rd., Duncannon (southbound)

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559379,"This hike was long — 22.6 miles — and the most difficult of the three days of our last prep hike. So we got up at 5 and left at 6. It was very hard dragging myself out of my sleeping bag. I was cold overnight from not wearing enough layers inside my sleeping bag, and it was 35 degrees when I got up. I ate three of Tony’s breakfast biscotti and then packed up. I couldn’t bring myself to drink anything because it was so cold. (I was already somewhat dehydrated from not drinking enough the day before for the same reason.) I wore a lot of layers — underwear, wool long underwear, long pants, fleece, down jacket, rain jacket, wool hat, and mittens — basically, everything I had. Scott, Paul and I left together and were soon joined by Rennie and Patti.  The first part of the hike was through farm fields. As dawn approached I heard lots of birdsong: my favorite, the white-throated sparrow, rufous-sided towhee, and lots of other songs I didn’t know. At one point when we were in light woods headed toward a field I saw something dart across the field in front of us. It was large but too dark to be a deer. When we got closer it stopped and faced our direction. Scott said it was an Eastern coyote. It was so big I would have taken it for a wolf. (I’ve only seen coyotes in Arizona, where they’re typically scrawny and about the size of a fox.) It ran ahead, stopped one more time, then darted into a wooded area in the middle of the field.  About 4 miles into the hike, the trail passed through the town of Boiling Springs. Scott, Paul, and I detoured to eat and take a bathroom break at a convenience store. We drank our coffee outside at a picnic table where three locals, one the mayor of Boiling Springs, were also having coffee. They told us some of the history of the place. An iron foundry made cannon balls for the Revolutionary War there, and a house in town was a stop on the Underground Railroad. As we left one directed us to “the Bubble,” one of the springs for which the town was named. From there we joined the trail beside an office of the Appalachian Trail Conference. The trail in town overlooked a body of water, on the opposite side of which were colorful old restored buildings. It was the first day of fly fishing season, and folks in waders were trying their luck. For once it was sunny. Hallelujah!  The men at the convenience store had told us that there was a good store for sandwiches at Hunters Run Road, 10.8 miles ahead. We decided to go there for lunch. The trail in between, however, was slow — continuous ups and downs with no overlooks, in trail terminology PUDs (pointless ups and downs). At some point Scott got ahead, and I was again hiking with Paul. The temperature quickly warmed up, eventually to 60 degrees, and I began shedding layers and adding them to my day pack. The last to go was my wool long underwear bottoms, which I took off right on the trail. At this time of year there are no leaves anywhere, and except at shelters there’s no private place to change. So Paul just walked ahead while I changed.  Around 1:00 we reached a place called a rock maze. At the top of a ridge, the trail was marked both in blazes and arrows. It directed us over and around rocks and through some very tight places. At one point we had to jump down about 5 feet, and I smacked my right knee quite hard on a rock beside where I was slithering down. We finally reached the crossroad to the store around 2:30. We were really dragging by then, so we walked the .3 mile there to try to rejuvenate ourselves. A burger, fries, and a Mountain Dew, although junky, hit the spot. We left the store at 3:00 feeling quite refreshed. We still had another 8.8 miles to go, so we hurried on the downhills and tried to keep the best pace we could on the uphills. In the last few miles there were more sections of rocks that we had to be cross very carefully.  We arrived at Pine Grove Furnace at 7:30 and headed for the Ironmaster’s Hostel. This is a nice old mansion that’s been restored and is used both as a hiking hostel and for weddings and other events. For $25 you get a real bed, a hot shower, and breakfast — awesome! A shower never felt so good! I was clean and in bed asleep before 10:00. I later learned that Bill, Arlene, and Lizzie arrived about 11:10. I can only image how tired they must have been spending so much time out on the trail.","Lisburn Rd. (southbound)

We made one stop at Walmart because Bill forgot his jacket, and he wanted to buy a gardening trowel for digging cat holes.Tonight most of the group members had dinner together at Shenanigans in Dahlonega.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562474,"It was a great first day.  We met at a Baptist Church near the Forest Service road that leads to the top of Springer Mountain.  Although our meeting time was noon, most of us were there early, so we got an earlier than planned start.  
What a great hike!  The day was sunny and lovely, and it's spring.  On the way to the top of Springer, the starting point, I saw dwarf crested irises, blue violets, white violets, and painted trillium (see photo), which I've only seen once before.  I heard scarlet tanagers, phoebes, and wood thrushes.  
At the top of Springer Mountain we took a lot of pictures and had a short meeting. Then we set off on the trail.  After we crossed the Forest Service road we walked through some truly lovely places -- an area with very tall pine trees (see photo), streams surrounded by rhododendrons, and a beautiful waterfall, Long Creek Waterfall (see photo).  At one point we came around a corner and Maria, Arlene's mother, screamed with excitement when she saw a pink lady slipper.  She recognized the flower from seeing it in quilts!  
We stopped at the footbridge at Three Forks, took off our socks and shoes, and soaked our feet in the water.  It was very cold or, as Maria said, refrescado.  At Long Creek waterfall Bill started wading out with all his clothes on.  Once there, he was overtaken with a desire to get completely submerged.  He sat in the water with the heavy flow landing on his head.  Because we were only hiking 7.2 miles (6.2 official trail miles plus a duplicate mile up to the top of Springer to the start), we had plenty of time to stop and see the sights.  We left the top of Springer at 2:15 and arrived at our stopping point shortly after 7 PM.  There's a picnic shelter at the cemetery, so we're sleeping inside the shelter tonight.  Since we had no tents set up for privacy I headed into the woods to do my little spit bath.  I'm hoping to stave off extreme stinkiness by cleaning up with wipes every night and wearing mostly wool clothing, which doesn't retain odors like synthetics do.  It's now 9 o'clock, and I'm headed off to bed.  It was a fantastic first day!","Springer Mountain

I had left my breakfast biscotti out on a table, and some critter, a mouse I guess, ate about half of it.  I didn't figure this out until after I'd eaten the rest, so let's hope the critter was healthy. I was on the trail at 6:35.  The day was very foggy.   Although it didn't rain, so much water blew off the trees that, although we had on full rain gear, we still got quite wet.  But it was about 70 degrees, so we didn't get cold.  It stayed very foggy all morning, but it was still beautiful.  Eventually the sun came out around 12:30.There were many beautiful wildflowers, including Catesby's trillium, wild columbine, wood betony (aka lousewort), toad lily (?), yellow-eyed grass, plus all the flowers I saw yesterday.  In several places there were large masses of flowers -- pink lady slipper, columbine, wild geranium, and a hillside of mayapple.  I also saw one flower I'd never seen before (see photo).  I ran into a ridge runner and showed him the photo of it, but he didn't know it either.  The most spectacular sight was wild azaleas (pinxster plant) that were bright orange and were trees rather than shrubs.  They were especially striking against the gray fog (see above photo).I hiked with Lizzie for most of the day.  She likes snakes and identified a tiny black snake as a ring neck.  We also saw two tiny red-spotted efts (see photo).  The hike was on relatively easy surface --  mostly dirt, hardly any rocks or roots. The whole day was a series of ups and downs over several mountains and into several gaps, none of them very steep or long.  We passed through or went over Hawk Mountain, Hightower Gap, Horse Gap, Sassafras Mountain, Cooper Gap, Justus Mountain, Gooch Mountain, Gooch Gap, Lisa Gap, and Ramrock Mountain.   I got to our camping spot about 4:30 and have now set up my tent.  After I finish this I'll fix something to eat.  Most of my food is pretty unappetizing.  But tomorrow the trail goes right through a town, so we'll be able to go to an outfitter and get real food for lunch.Another really great day!","Hickory Flats Cemetery pavilion

Scott, Rennie, and Terri from our group were already there.  Scott had had atrial fibrillation all the way up and down Blood Mountain, so he was waiting for a shuttle to take him to hospital.  Terri had ordered a pizza, and she shared it with us.  Then I bought some warm dry clothes to wear back out into the wind -- a wool long underwear top, a fleece pullover, a pair of wool socks, and a fleece hat.  Then I hit the snacks and bought a ham and cheese sandwich and a banana to eat for supper.  We were at the store for quite a while.  When we came out we were relieved to see that the sun had come out.  Within the first quarter mile we started putting some of our wet clothes back on to dry them out.  After Neel Gap, there were only 7.2 more miles.  They were difficult ones, though.  We went up and down one mountain after another finishing the day with a very steep one, Wildcat Mountain.Once the sun came out our spirits lifted considerably.  There were masses of trilliums, and the woods we walked through were lovely.  It was light woods with lots of tall green plants and flowers on either side of the trail.  We got to our stopping place shortly before 7.  I'm now organized to go for tomorrow and tucked into my purple sleeping bag named Eleanor.  It's still very windy and cold.","Woody Gap, GA 60

Our group leader Warren is always talking about how it's safe to drink spring water if it's located in places that are likely to be unpolluted.  So at the second spring we bottled water and just drank it.  We refilled our bottles again at a third spring.  Lizzie is very heat-sensitive, and we both wanted to find a stream to soak our feet in.  But we had a lot of miles to do, and each time we came to a marked water source it was .5 mile downhill.  So  that would add an extra mile to an already long and difficult hike.  Terri finally decided to go ahead, and Lizzie and I finished together.Today is a town day.  We went to town to get groceries, ate real food at a restaurant, got showers, and are now settled into bunks at a hostel.  I have a top bunk, which I'm much too old for.  If I have to get up in the night I may kill myself.  Tomorrow we have an even harder day.  Although the terrain doesn't look difficult from the profile, we've learned that looks can be deceiving.

We've seen several different kinds of salamander -- a plain orange one, a plain black one, and an orange one with many spots.  We've also seen one wild turkey, and I saw a squirrel today, the first of the hike.  These first 85 miles have been beautiful, but there have been massive amounts of poison ivy.  Much of it is fresh and shiny with lots of irritant oil.  I've been trying to avoid it.  Yesterday Lizzie and I realized that we've been petting dogs who may be covered with it.  I've had a change of heart.  I'm going to get into my dry bedclothes and get into my sleeping bag.  I think part of the experience of thru hiking the AT is getting up and putting on wet clothes.  Warren, our leader, says that thru hiking the AT can only be done if you embrace the inherent difficulties.   Tomorrow I'll embrace the difficulties of hiking 20 miles in the cold and rain.  Any of you out there with a direct line to the weather controller, please send a request for some dry weather soon.","Dick's Creek Gap, US 76

Then I remembered that I completely forgot to eat any dinner, so I had no calories in me.  My left hip was hurting from the cold, but my ibuprofen was in the van.  Finally I got out my space blanket and put it over the sleeping bag.  It was almost instantly warmer.When I got up it was cold, but my tent had dried out from the wind the night before.  And it was sunny.  Warren had offered to meet the group 3.9 miles into the day's hike to take us to breakfast and shopping in town (Franklin, NC). We were able to hike with no packs, and having real breakfast was a huge motivator.  We got to the road crossing at Winding Stair Gap around 9:30 or so.  Bill drove us to Shoney's for the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet.  I ate an amazing amount of food -- so much I felt sick.  I get hungry about every two hours, and I try to eat each time I'm hungry.  But it's been so cold that I've missed my morning caffeine.  I was mixing powdered milk with instant coffee each morning and drinking it cold.  But when it's really cold I find it hard to drink cold liquids.  So it was a fabulous treat to have hot coffee and real food. We all ate a lot and then bought sandwiches to go.  About an hour later I was hungry again, but I didn't stop to eat.  We were again racing to beat a rainstorm, and again I wasn't fast enough to beat it.  I spent the last three hours hiking through rain, wind, and intermittent hail.  I was completely miserable.  When I got to the top of the bald I had trouble finding where we were parked, so this added more time.  By then it was back down to 40 degrees.  We are 5292 feet in elevation, so it may also be windy.Only one of us is staying in a tent tonight: we've all just had it with cold and rain.  Arlene and Terri are sleeping in the front seats of Randy's car.  Bill is sleeping in the women's restroom at the trailhead.  I'm sleeping in the back of the van.  Lizzie is sleeping in the car of a friend who came to visit.  Only Rennie is in his tent.  When it's cold and wet it takes all my mental energy just to get the bodily functions done - keep warm, eat enough calories, drink enough fluid, etc.  I'm really not fully in my right mind because I so fear and hate being cold.  I'm hoping I can start enjoying hiking again soon - stopping to notice the sights instead of always hurrying to avoid rain.  Tomorrow it's supposed to clear and be about 55.  That sounds fabulous.  Let's hope it happens.  It was nice long enough for me to see a junco and a beautiful waterfall.","Rock Gap

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563646,"When I woke the temperature was just above freezing, a record low temperature for this area, but sun was forecast.  Wayah Bald is supposed to have spectacular views in all directions, but all we saw was fog.  Soon, however, the fog started to burn off, and the day got warmer.We spent much of the day above 5000 feet walking along a rolling ridge, with a long descent at the end of the day.  In one place we saw a whole hillside of fiddlehead ferns. I guess this must have been the north side of the hill because we've been seeing many small new ferns elsewhere.  I also saw a another junco, a rabbit, and a small garter snake.Much of the trail we hiked today had been recently burnt in wildfires, and the devastation was massive.  Previously we've seen thickets of rhododendron burned, but this was fully mature forest with large trees.  When we got to places where we could see a view of other mountains there were whole mountains that were burned.  We also got our first view of the Smokies -- with snow atop them.  Lizzie and I hurried today because we wanted to get to Nantahala Outdoor Center in time to have a restaurant meal.  We actually smelled the food coming down the trail.  Tonight we did laundry and are trying to decide whether to day hike or backpack the Smokies.  If we day hike, there are two days that are over 30 miles a day.  I'd like to avoid that.  But if the weather is going to be cold, I don't want to be carrying a heavy pack and sleeping in the cold.  Tomorrow we have a relatively short hike (13.6 miles) that starts with a 5-mile climb out of this gap.  One thing I've noticed about the trail in Georgia and North Carolina is that the gaps are named and marked with signs, while the mountaintops are not marked.  Where I've hiked in Maine the mountain tops are marked with signs and the elevation is marked.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563819,"Our hike today was relatively short, but it was substantial.  We stayed in a four woman bunkhouse at Nantahala Outdoor Center - Arlene, Lizzie, Terri, and I - with Bill sleeping on the floor.  I got a really good night's sleep, and in the morning we had breakfast and coffee at the restaurant before starting our hike. It made a huge difference having eaten real food and drunk two cups of coffee. Lizzie has a stove with her, and we're thinking of getting up earlier so we can start the day with coffee.  (We currently get up at 5:45 and start hiking between 6:30 and 7:00.)The hike started with a 5-mile uphill, which I attacked with caffeine-fueled vigor. Lizzie and I have similar paces, so we've been hiking together.  We're working at getting a rhythm that will allow us to hike more efficiently.  That way we could spend more time seeing the sights and enjoying sensual pleasures such as soaking our feet in the cold streams we pass.  I lead the uphill portions, and Lizzie leads the flat and downhill.  She does this to a song playing in her head; I do it playing ""King's' Special"" by BB King  playing in my head.Once we hiked out of Nantahala Gorge we were at high elevations all day. There were fewer wildflowers and lots of rhododendron thickets.  As it was hot, we stopped in the shade of the rhododendrons many times to drink.  We've taken to drinking from springs at these high elevations without treating the water.  My hands have gotten very sunburned.  I don't like putting sunscreen on them because it gets my hands all slimy, and we don't get much opportunity to bathe. Today at one of the springs Lizzie took mud and smeared it on her knees and the backs of her hands both to cool her off and to protect herself from the sun. I put mud on the backs of my hands, and it did provide some protection.  I think my long-term solution will involve some kind of lightweight gloves.The highest point of the day, both literally and figuratively, was Cheoah Bald. It's a grassy clearing high on a mountain with views of many ranges of mountains.  Swallows were swooping overhead, and we also saw another junco.  We heard red-breasted grosbeaks but didn't see them.  We continue to hear scarlet tanagers but still haven't seen one.  We stopped at Cheoah Bald to take in the view and also to take off our socks and shoes to air out our feet.  It's amazing how ten minutes of fresh air can rejuvenate one's feet.  We also stopped to soak our feet in a cold stream.  Very nice.Tonight we're camped on a birding trail in Stecoah Gap.  It's quiet and peaceful, and I expect to sleep well in my cosy tent.   More adventures to come tomorrow.  Stay tuned.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Today we weren't able to get our act together to start any earlier than 7.  We started with a long uphill and then stayed high on a ridge for most of the day. We ended the day with a long descent to Fontana Dam.  Again what looked like a relatively easy day turned out to be harder than expected.  Tonight we're camped right inside the entrance to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, which is in Tennessee.  The trail goes right over the dam.  This dam was a flood control project that was built by the TVA.  Lizzie, who has kayaked here, says that when the water level is really low in winter you can see the town that was flooded below.The wildflowers are starting to be fewer in number.  We're no longer seeing hillsides of trilliums and pink lady slippers.  Mountain laurel is just starting to bloom, and we're still hearing lots of birds.  I especially enjoy hearing the wood thrush.Tomorrow will be our first backpacking night.  We had an option of doing a day hike from here to Clingmans Dome, a distance of 32.4 miles, or breaking the hike down into two days and camping at one of the shelters.  This morning only two of the group were planning to backpack, but as of this evening we all planning to.  It was a really hard day for us all, and we couldn't see doubling our mileage tomorrow.  I'm waiting for my phone to charge and then am headed off to bed.","Stecoah Gap, NC 143

My pack isn't very heavy by thru hiker standards, but it was heavier and bulkier than I'm used to.  The hike was also ambitious - 15.2 miles of nearly all uphill.  It was hot, and we were slow.  It took us close to 12 hours to hike the 15.2 miles. At lunchtime Lizzie and I found a shady spot under a tree right off the trail and had a picnic.  Arlene came along, and it was very pleasant.  I've been having trouble eating enough, and everything left in my food bin is unappealing.  Today I took some flour tortillas and a small package of sliced hard salami.  I'm not a fan of that kind of meat, but it doesn't have to be refrigerated until opened.  We tried to eat the whole pack at lunch and came close.  I managed to eat three hearty sandwiches and found them delicious.  I want to avoid losing any weight, but I'm often either too tired to eat or too disgusted by the options.  Tonight we're sleeping in a large shelter in the loft.  Our food is hung on cables high in a tree to avoid bear incursions, and our packs are hung on hooks high in the shelter.  We'll get an early start tomorrow because we have another hard day - 17.2 miles of all uphill again.The mental and physical effort today didn't allow me much time to look around, but I noticed some gray beardtongue.  Many of the higher parts of the trail were lined with fresh unfaded bluets.  Although the physical part of this hike is difficult and exhausting, the mental part is even harder.  The mornings usually speed by, and suddenly we'll check and discover we've already gone 5 or 6 miles.  But starting around 3 things start to drag.  The miles seem long, and time moves very slowly.  This is the hardest part of the day.  Another hard aspect of doing the hike supported is that we have to arrive at the designated ending site in time to set up our tents, pack our packs for the next day, and eat before going to bed.  This doesn't leave any free time to just relax and think.  Keeping this journal uses all of my free time and energy.  I don't begrudge the time, however, because it's my way of preserving the memories of what I see and do on the hike.  The time seems to be flying by.","Great Smoky Mountains National Park, southern boundary

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564295,"Last night was our first time staying in a shelter, and it was quite nice.  The shelter had room for quite a few people, with an upper loft.  Since we got there late we got the loft accommodations.  The shelters are reputed to be overrun with mice, but this one wasn't.  I heard a pair of barred owls calling before I went to sleep, so maybe they're keeping the mice population under control.Lizzie and I planned to leave at 6:30, so we got up at our usual time.  I got started at 6:40, and Lizzie caught up with me within the first mile.  The terrain was challenging: long uphill, much of it steep.  For the first five miles we leapfrogged with Bill and Arlene.  Then we got a bit ahead.  When we stopped for lunch at the first shelter we heard that Arlene had fallen and hit her head. The wound bled a lot, and a hiker had stopped to provide some first aid and bandage it up.  The next hiker who arrived said she was back up on her feet and in good spirits, so we continued on our way.The day's hike was very difficult and seemingly unending. For the last few miles Lizzie had to nip at my heels like a sheepdog to keep me going.  I felt like getting down on my hands and knees and crawling the last several miles.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564428,"Today was a busy day but not just with hiking: it was a town day.  This means that we had a short hike followed by doing various chores in town.We started at Clingman's Dome, where we had stealth camped.  The weather was cold and blustery, and I spent the night in the driver's seat of one of the Expedition guests.  I took only my sleeping bag liner rather than my sleeping bag, so I was cold.  I didn't get much sleep.  I was so tired when I got in yesterday that I didn't take any pictures of the fabulous view from the top of the mountain - rank upon rank of mountains and a beautiful  sunset.  This morning it was foggy, so there was not nearly as nice a view.  Our hike was through some distinctly different forest from what we've been hiking in.  Until about the last five miles of yesterday's hike we've been in Southern hardwood forests, with lots of light spilling through the just-budding leaves.  Today we were in evergreen forest that was dark and full of moss-covered downed trees. It reminded me very much of parts of Maine.  The feeling in it is wonderful.  It's quiet and peaceful, and it smells good.  It's nice walking on beds of evergreen needles.  In one place we came to wild boar containment bridges.  These were ramped bridges that allow hikers to cross wire fences designed to exclude wild boars from an Appalachian beech forest. According to the signage, the boar, who are a non-native invasive species, destroy many of the indigenous plants in that environment.I recently turned my right ankle, which I have taped using a figure eight ankle wrap, and have blisters on my right heel and one toe.  So I decided to take an easy day and not try to hurry.  I hiked with Arlene, the slowest person in our group, who is a delightful person.  Yesterday I wrote that she had fallen on some rocks and cut her head.  After finishing her hike she went to the emergency room, where they cleaned her wound and gave her five staples. She didn't get back until 3 AM.  But she was up and ready to hike at the usual time.  Talk about sturdy peasants!After everyone was finished hiking around 12:30, Warren drove us all in the van to do our errands.  We first went to the post office to pick up mail, then to a laundromat to wash clothes, then to an Italian restaurant to load up on carbs for our next few days' hike.  I struck it rich at the post office: I had 5 packages.  I should be the most popular person in the group because I have lots of goodies to share.  My friend Tony sent me my summer clothes, homemade bread with raisins or craisins, his special homemade protein breakfast bar, and delicious chocolate chip oatmeal cookies.  My college roomie Meggie sent her special Meg bars, a purple merino wool beanie to wear to bed at night, and hand and foot warmers.  My friend Sharon sent me my medications and threw in chocolate covered espresso beans and Girl Scout cookies.  And my friend Joan scrounged a variety of conveniently-sized plastic bags at my request.  After our errands, Warren asked whether we wanted to stay in a hotel in town (Gatlinburg, TN) rather than stealth camp in the rain and thunderstorms that were forecast (and happening as we did our errands), and we all agreed immediately.  So now I am well-fed, freshly-showered, wearing clean pjs, and writing from the comfort of a real bed.  I've never been so happy to be staying at a Motel 6.  Life is good.Even though I spend virtually all my time being ravenously hungry, I still could only eat about half of my spaghetti and meatballs at the Italian restaurant.  I brought the remainder back to my hotel room and plan to eat it for breakfast tomorrow.  I also bought a big piece of fried chicken and an avocado to eat for dinner tomorrow night.  Maybe the hiking will go better with some calories in my stomach.  Tomorrow we set off for another two-day backpacking trip to finish the Smokies -- about 15 miles each day.  It is supposed to rain for part of the day tomorrow but clear later.  It's been a huge morale booster to hear from so many readers and friends.  Thanks to you all.  We've now completed 206.8 miles of the trail in the 14 days we've been hiking.  And I feel ready to go on.","Clingman's Dome

It rained until 2 PM but remained completely foggy until nearly 5 o'clock.  We were at elevations ranging from 5045 to 6216, and the vegetation was unlike much of what I'm familiar with.  There was a small trillium with olive-colored leaves, a small alpine-looking flowering bush, and an aromatic minty-smelling plant that Bill really liked. It was too cold and wet to stop and take pictures.I hiked the end of the hike with an interesting young man, trail-named Mr. White.  The conversation helped pass the time of another long, wet hike.  Now I'm tucked into my sleeping bag trying to get warm.  The Smokies have been a lot of work for not much reward: lots of hard hiking but few opportunities for the spectacular views the Smokies are known for.  I'm ready to be dry and warm and hike somewhere that I can see something.  Tomorrow we'll finish the Smokies.","Newfound Gap, US 441

There is a parking lot where the van could park .3 from the top.  Warren told us to go to the top first on the AT, then come down a side trail to pick up our gear from the parking lot.  We didn't do that, which totally aggravated him.  Instead, everyone except Lizzie camped near the parking lot so that we can get an early start on our long day tomorrow.  After we got our tents set up we returned to the Appalachian Trail to cover the section we'd missed and went to the top of the bald to watch the sunset.  The view from the bald was astoundingly beautiful -- rank upon rank of mountains in all directions.  I ran into Mellow and Mr. White, two nice young men who appear to be covering about the same mileage as our group, and Terri took my picture with them.  After a time Warren came up and pointed out the mountains by name, showing us where we'll be hiking for the next three days.  Everyone except Rennie stayed to watch the sunset.  It was a very pleasant day.  Tomorrow we're hiking 19.8 miles to Hot Springs, NC.  We hope to arrive in time to bathe in the hot springs and get some calorific treats such as hamburgers and milkshakes.  We're staying at a campground that has showers --what a treat!","Green Corner Rd.

She can use it so long as she has started and has momentum, but each time she stops it's extremely painful for her to start again.At the tops of mountains we slowed down to check for cell service, and once we found we had service.  Terri, who has Verizon, was able to call her husband.  My AT&T only allowed me to send some emails of my journal and a few texts.  It didn't remain long enough for me to get answers to my texts.  I'm starting to feel quite isolated.  My only direct communication with the outside world is writing this journal, which obviously is a bit one-sided.  I often go two or three days without cell service except for the occasional signal at the top of a mountain.  Then I hit the send button.   Once in a while I get service long enough to have a 5-minute call with my sister Diane.   It's all quite frustrating.  I enjoyed the first five hours of the hike very much.  We got on the trail at the top of Max Patch Bald just as the sun was rising and took a moment to enjoy that.  Then the trail took us down into rhododendron forests and across many streams.  The bird sounds at that time of day are loud and make the forest seem very peaceful.  Terri has a good eye for seeing birds and creatures, and before long we got a close look at a rufous-sided towhee.  Later while filling our water bottles at a spring we saw a small gray bird delicately sipping water from the same stream.  Terri thought the bird might be a vireo; I had no idea what it was.  I've forgotten to mention that for the last several days we've been hearing the veery's song.  I have no idea what that bird looks like, but I remember the song because of how pretty it is.  One of the frustrating things about having no cell service is being unable to look things up. I continue to see flowers that I don't know, but today I didn't even take pictures because we were in such a rush.  We got to town at 5 and headed straight for the diner, which is on the Main Street of Hot Springs on the AT.  I ordered and ate most of a huge dinner of pork roast, mashed potatoes and gravy, dressing, green beans, and a huge glass of milk.  Very satisfying.  The only thing missing was a cold beer, but by the time we reached the tavern we worried we'd be unable to muster the energy to get to the campground if we stopped.  We're staying tonight at a nice campground, so now I'm showered and clean.  Being clean is one of the parts of ordinary life I really miss out here. I wish I had enough energy to walk back to the laundromat: the clothes for the laundry are stinky and started to mildew.  Tomorrow we have a shorter day (16.3 miles), so we're going to proceed at a more leisurely pace, stop and soak our feet in cold streams if we come across any.  I'll also stop and take more pictures.  The last part of today's hike we went through a lovely thicket of mountain laurel in bloom.  I hope to see more tomorrow.  Dear Readers, please forgive me for not responding to your notes in the guest book.  As I said, my cell phone service out here is abysmal or nonexistent.","Max Patch Bald

We continue to see flowers that I don't know and can't look up because of lack of internet.  The best-smelling flower of the day was cow parsnip, which was just starting to bloom.  We walked through some very fragrant places today. We also heard several strange birds that I don't remember ever hearing before. Often at the end of the day we have a downhill to our camping spot and come through some very  pretty woods.  Today was another of those days, but we found it hard to appreciate because we were so worn out from the hike.  Even though the hike was not overly hard, we've hiked 289.7 miles in the last 17 days, or 17 miles a day, without a break and are getting tired.  This weekend we're going to Trail Days in Damascus, VA.  Trail Days is an annual festival celebrating the trail and hikers.  Many hikers use the event as a reunion.  Our group will have two days off from hiking.  We're all looking forward to this with great anticipation. Today for the first time in several days I got cell service strong enough to make several phone calls -- one to my sister Diane and one to my friend Susan.  And I also was able to check my email.  I'm so grateful for all the encouraging messages people sent me in response to my recent text about feeling isolated and lonely.  Thanks so much to Cassie, Dennis, and my bestie/sister Diane and all the others who have sent messages of encouragement when I needed them.","Hot Springs, NC

The hike started with a 5-mile uphill which ended in a fabulous view at Big Firescald Knob.  On the way we saw a small cinnamon-colored toad and lots of lovely white flowers.  There was a patch of wild lily of the valley, which I've never seen before.  It took some rock scrambling to get up there and more to get down.  While we were admiring the views Lizzie arrived.  We all ate lunch at this high spot.  Then Lizzie went scrambling down the rocks like a mountain goat.    It took Terri and me a long time to get up to the knob, and we were concerned that we might get in quite late if we didn't pick up the pace.  So in the afternoon we avoided stops and kept a steady pace.  She's still being very careful with her right knee.  My dodgy right ankle appears to be cured now.  When we had about 5.5 miles left I took off using the glissade method of making the descent. I arrived at our road crossing at 6 PM - 15 minutes short of 12 hours.  That's quite a good time for me, between 1.5 and 1.75 miles per hour.  Terri arrived about 15 minutes later and Lizzie shortly thereafter.  We're still waiting for Arlene and Bill at 8:15 PM.Not long after I got to the road crossing a torrential downpour started.  There's space for two people to sleep in the van, and the rest of us have set up our tents.  Mine got thoroughly soaked because I had not put it together freestanding before and had problems.  It's now stopped raining but has gotten colder.  I'm in my wool long underwear but will not use my sleeping bag tonight: it's made of treated down and could be really damaged by getting wet.  I have a new space blanket that I'll use instead.  Tomorrow we only have to hike 8.5 miles and then will go to Damascus for Trail Days.  I'm looking forward to sleeping indoors.  I wrote this entry hunkered down in the van in my dry clothes waiting for a break in the rain to set up for the night.  Although I dread it, I think the time has come.","Log Cabin Drive

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565339,"Today was a short hiking day because we were going to Trail Days in Damascus.  Rennie, in the tent beside mine, started to stir at 5:10, and soon everyone was getting up.  I was the next to last to leave at 6:20.   For the first several miles of the hike the trail was wet, but once we reached the other side of the hill it was completely dry.  We passed a beautiful waterfall and got to one high rocky point with a great view of the receding mountains.  Everyone was done by noon, and we left for Warren's place, the Appalachian Folk School.We all took our bins out of the van and put them on tables in the picnic shelter. The plan is to go through them all and send home a lot of stuff we don't need.  I also set up my tent in the shelter so it could dry.  Warren gave Arlene and me a key to his car so that we could come and go to Trail Days.  Terri's husband picked her up to go home for the weekend.  Lizzie was picked up by a friend and is gone tor the weekend.  Bill's girlfriend Jan met him at the Folk School so they could spend the weekend together. Arlene and I then headed off to shower.  Arlene enjoyed her ""Hollywood shower"" (navy slang for a long and luxurious shower). Afterwards we laid down for 20 minutes to nap before heading downtown.   We met Bill and Jan for dinner at the Old Mill Inn, a restaurant overlooking a small but broad waterfall.  Randy and Rennie joined us for drinks.  Then we walked to the Methodist Church to hear Warren's presentation about his 40-year love of the Appalachian Trail.  We didn't get home till 11:30 and were totally exhausted.  That's way past our bedtime.  More Trail Days tomorrow.","Devil Fork Gap, NC 212

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565718,"We are back on the trail after a two-day break to attend Trail Days in Damascus, VA.  My feet feel amazingly better - enough so that I notice how my knees feel now (not great).  There were many interesting presentations, but the event I liked best was the Baptist Church's washing and massaging of feet.  There were about 10 volunteers who dealt with a steady stream of hikers.  The service was free, with only mild proselytizing.  The weather forecast today was for  thunderstorms clearing in early afternoon. So Warren didn't rush to get us to the trail.  We were going over Big Bald today, a large open area that would not be a good place to be during an electrical storm.  We arrived back at Sam's Gap and started hiking around 10:40.  By the time I got to Big Bald about 180 degrees of the view was clear; the rest, to the west, was still clouded over.  Nonetheless, we got a wonderful view.  The rest of the hike was uneventful.  This was the first day that I've hiked alone.  Lizzie had spent the night at a friend's house in Asheville and was to meet us at 10:30.  She arrived early and thought she had missed us, so she started hiking about 20 minutes before we started.  I was never able to catch up with her.  She's going to spend several more nights at her friend's house (likely rainy nights), so I may be alone more this week.  Terri took all her gear home with her on Friday and informed Warren that she was staying home for a while to rest her knee.  I fear she may decide not to come back.One of the people who signed the guest book asked whether that was a bruise she saw in a picture of me.  The answer is yes.  All of us are bruised, abraded, or injured in some way.  It's part of the process of hiking.  The day I got the horsefly bite I realized that I had contusions or injuries on both legs, both arms, both hands, and one of my feet.  This is normal for the trail, I think.  One of my more colorful falls came while hiking in perfect weather on an easy trail. A tree had fallen across the trail.  Instead of cutting out the part of the tree that obstructed the trail, the maintainers cut a notch into the tree, making a sort of step.  I saw Terri step carefully over the log and decided I'd use the step instead. While I was thinking this I tripped with my left leg.  Realizing that I was going down, I grabbed for the edge of the notch/step.  This caused me to do a complete somersault.  I landed in a patch of stinging nettle with my head partially wedged underneath the rest of he dead tree.  I was on my back with my pack on, so I could hardly move.  Then I started laughing.  I was like an overturned turtle trying to move using my arms and legs but weighed down by my shell/pack.  If Terri hadn't been there to help me right myself it would have taken me a long time to get up.  Once I was up I sat on the step for a moment to assess whether I had injuries.  I looked down on my pants and saw blood on my left leg.  Then I noticed that I had a small cut on my left forearm.  I got out my little first aid kit to clean and bandage the cut.  In the meantime though Terri noticed the blood on my pants and insisted that I pour water on it immediately to keep the pants from staining. Only after that was done did I clean the cut and put on a bandaid.  Fortunately for me I didn't have that much skin contact with the stinging nettle, so I was relatively unscathed.Just a few days ago Bill had his first fall.  I've fallen a bunch of times, including once today on stepping stones across a creek.  I've concluded that my bones are strong because they haven't broken in these falls.  Arlene fell twice today on some slippery wood steps at the Appalachian Folk School but also is fine. Anyway, we are a conglomeration of injuries that so far haven't held us back.  It's all normal.Our schedule for the next two weeks is ambitious.  Tomorrow we are hiking 19.5 miles to Indian Grave Gap and the day after tomorrow 21.1 miles to Hughes Gap.  In all we have six days in the next two weeks with hikes more than 20 miles long.  I think I'm ready.  I've been working on trying to keep a steady consistent pace uphill and down.  Today my speed was 1.75 miles per hour.  I want to be able to hike this fast or faster so that I have more time to stop and see the sights along the way.","Sam's Gap, US 23, I-26

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565832,"Yesterday we lucked out and didn't get all the rain that was predicted.  Today our luck ran out.  I got up at 5:30 to get an early start.  It rained overnight but only lightly, so my tent was only wet on the outside.  I was able to pack it up so that the inside  layer of mesh and floor remained separated from the outside and stayed dry.  It wasn't raining when I left at 6:40, but it started drizzling shortly into the hike.  All morning it stayed warm and only rained lightly.  It was a pleasant hike through spring forest and lots of rhododendron thickets and mountain laurel in bloom (see photo).  I got a boost from my experimental new caffeine drink, Starbucks canned double shot espresso.  After a while Sue and Maggie, members of the 2015 Expedition who are visiting for the week, caught up with me.  I hiked with them until we reached the first shelter 5 miles in.  We stopped there and had substantial snacks/lunch.  While we were there Lizzie caught up.  After we ate, the four of us headed out, but I soon fell behind.  Lizzie is still staying with her friend in Asheville and was hiking fast.  My left knee was hurting, so I didn't try to keep up.  About 12 miles in, I reached Uncle Johnny's hostel.  This is a funky but nice old place right on the trail near the Nolichucky River.  There are bunk rooms, some microwaveable food, a good selection of camping gear, wool socks, resupply items, all (except the bunks) in a space about 15 feet square.  Sue, Maggie, Lizzie, and Randy were sitting in a sheltered place outside eating snacks.  I went in and got a Klondike bar and some coffee.  About 12:30 the rain increased to a steady downpour.  I had good cell phone service, so I called my sister Diane.  I waited a while to see if the rain would slow down, but it didn't. At 1:20 I headed out, just as Arlene and Bill were arriving.  Spurred on by my coffee I set off into the downpour.  The temperature was in the 60s, so it wasn't cold as long as I kept moving.  But I couldn't stop for any breaks.  I got to our stopping point, Indian Grave Gap shortly after 6 PM.  By then there was a torrential downpour.  Rennie had his tent set up, but there was no sign of anyone else.  Rennie said that Sue and Maggie complained of being cold, so Warren took them to town.  As it turned out, Warren took them back to the Folk School to stay.  They'll be hiking south for the rest of the week and leaving their cars at the north end of the hike.Today was the last day of Randy's visit and his final day on the AT.  He's been hiking southbound on our hikes for the past two weeks to complete his section hike of the AT.  Today was his last section.  It seems anticlimactic to end hiking alone in the rain.  To celebrate he got a hotel room in town.  His plan was to run a big hot bath, perhaps with bubbles, and drink a beer while soaking away the grime.  He's bringing us out breakfast sandwiches and coffee in the morning before he heads home to Illinois.  I had intended to start introducing the members of the expedition, but by the time I start writing I'm sometimes too tired.  Maybe tomorrow, but don't hold your breath. Our hike tomorrow is 21.5 miles, and it's supposed to continue to rain.  So, a slogging through the mud day.  Arlene, Bill, and I moved all the bins out of the van and are sleeping inside.","Spivey Gap, US 19 W

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566027,"Bill, Arlene, and I slept in the van last night.  We had a long day scheduled, and it was supposed to rain again.  We got up at 5:30 and got ready to go.  Randy stopped by shortly after 6:30 to say goodbye and brought me some real coffee. Bill, Arlene, and I left about 6:40.  Rennie, as usual, left at first light.  Lizzie was staying with her friend again and was to be dropped off.  The beginning of the hike was quite pretty.  For the first several hours it didn't rain.  We ascended the mountain through thickets of blooming mountain laurel. Because of all the rain, streams were flowing rapidly.  We passed over several footbridges.  The temperature was in the 60s, but it was quite foggy.  I walked with Arlene for a while and then went ahead.  We passed through a large grassy bald called Beauty Spot, but the fog obscured any view.  About 4 miles into the hike Lizzie caught up with me.  We hadn't gone far when we came upon a strange sight: a tree hung with eggs, balloons, laminated notes, solar-powered lights, and other decorations (see photo).  At first I took it as a surprise for the hikers passing by, but when I got close I saw the sign on the tree.  The decorations were a memorial for someone named Max.  There was a plastic box with a book and a pen inside.  The sign on the tree asked folks to take a picture and post it on Facebook so the family will know that their memorial is being seen.  I would like to have looked at the book, but we had to hurry on.  Not long after, Lizzie took off at a high speed.  She's meeting her friend again this evening and needed to finish the hike in time to be picked up.  For the rest of the day I hiked alone.  When I reached a high spot I checked for cell service and was able to get a weather report.  Rain was not expected until 2 PM.  So I tried to make good time before the rain.  It was very windy and cold up on the ridges.  About 1:40 I reached a road crossing at Iron Mountain Gap -- 9.5 miles from our end point.  A shuttle driver was there picking up two sets of hikers.  The hikers warned us that rain was coming.  The shuttle driver added that there were tornado warnings.  Almost exactly at 2 PM it started to rain.  Although it didn't rain hard, the strong winds propelled the water off trees and drove it into me.  This lasted several hours and made the trail treacherous.  The trail became even more muddy than it had been before.  Although I started the day in wet socks and wet shoes, it still felt bad to slog through continuous mud.  My feet stayed very cold all day and are still cold now.After about an hour the storm abated, and the sun came out briefly.  I took off my hat and poncho and started to feel like maybe the storm had passed. Moments later there was a downpour which lasted for the remaining 6 miles of the hike.  On my last uphill I heard thunder.  This really frightened me, and I took off as fast as I could go to get to the downhill part of the mountain.  I arrived at the van shortly after 6 PM, which makes my speed for the day 1.75 miles per hour.  Arlene and Bill arrived about an hour later.  We're now settling down in the van for the night although the rain has stopped.  It was a long and hard day.Tomorrow is a shorter day: 12.7 miles.  The weather is supposed to be similar to today's, followed by a cold front.  I'm starting to worry that I shouldn't have sent my warm clothes home.I apologize for writing so much about the weather, but when you live outdoors it is a factor that overwhelms all else in life.  I'm starting to get a feel for what it must be like to be homeless:  always cold, wet, hungry, and dirty.","Indian Grave Gap, TN 395

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566153,"Today was a shorter day, and we had no detailed weather forecast except that a cold front was coming.  We knew that as soon as we stepped out of the van because it was noticeably colder than it has been. It wasn't raining when we left, but I had four layers of clothes on top: long-sleeved synthetic shirt, wind-resistant fleece with hood, rain jacket, and poncho.  We're now to the point where we're grateful for long uphills in the morning because they keep us warm.  Our aerobic capacity has increased to the point where we no longer dread them.  I started out with Lizzie, but she was on a fast track today so I soon fell behind.  I was moving slowly.  Arlene soon caught up, and we hiked together for several miles.  It was windy, and the woods were completely engulfed in fog.  At the top of the big climb there was a large bald. Momentarily we got a view of the mountains, but then the fog moved in again.  While we were on the first one it started to rain again.  The rain continued for the rest of the hike, sometimes with substantial wind.  I had taken off my rain jacket on the uphill, but now I looked for a place to put it back on.  About a mile from the end I came to a shelter and put it back on.  We hiked about a mile off the trail to camp at a road where the van could park.  Rennie, the toughest of our group, tried to put up his tent, but it died.  So tonight we are all sleeping in the van --  Bill on the box, Rennie in the front seat, and Arlene and me on the floor in the back.  (Lizzie is again staying at her friend's house.) Some of Warren's musical friends, Bob and Patty Tatum, came by about 5:45 and brought treats: hummus, carrots, apples, bananas, a mystery fruit (looks like an apricot, tastes like a plum), cupcakes and cookies. We were already  hunkered down in the van, so they joined us inside along with Warren.  We had a little party of sorts.  It was a wonderful treat to have fresh fruit.  We all had a fun time.  They said tomorrow is supposed to be sunny, then more crummy weather for the next two days. This county is on track to set a record for rain for May.  I'm sorry I had to be part of it.  Now it's time to get ready for bed, and we're waiting for a lull in the rain to go pee.  I found a plastic container with a secure lid in the garbage, so I can brush my teeth without going outside.  I'm tired of this awful weather.  I HATE cold!","Hughes Gap, TN 1130

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566289,"We passed the 400 mile mark today, and we left North Carolina for the last time (see photo).  The trail north of Georgia follows the North Carolina/Tennessee border closely and just wanders back and forth.  Today we stopped wandering and planted ourselves firmly in Tennessee.  
More importantly, the sun finally came out!  We started the day out in cold, foggy, windy weather and headed up the hill to pick up the trail at Yellow Mountain Gap.  This is the site of a 1780 Revolutionary War battle in which the Yankees routed the British.  There's a nice historical marker there.  
We headed uphill to go over two high balds: Little Hump Mountain and Hump Mountain (see photo).  Warren expected the hike to be ""interesting"" because of the high winds.  It was.  As I approached the open area the wind caught me full force from the left side and nearly knocked me over.  These two mountains looked like what I picture a moor in Scotland to look like -  grassy, foggy, with a few rocks and stunted trees here and there.  I timed the walk up Hump Mountain.  It took me 45 minutes to fight my way up .9 mile.  The wind was so strong that it blew me sideways to the right.  I had to bend forward to make my body a bigger mass to resist the wind.  It was hard and cold work.  Once I got to the leeward side, the sun came out, and I actually saw some lovely views of the mountains.
From there I passed into woods.  The hike from 6:40 AM till 12:15 PM was very muddy and wet -- quite treacherous, even though there was a long downhill that should have been easy.  Going down one tricky place a young man in a fluorescent yellow shirt gallumphed past me saying that Lizzie was behind me and would catch up soon.  All the way up the mountains I'd been seeing shoe prints that matched her trail runners, so I had assumed, erroneously, that she was ahead of me.  
Lizzie did catch up with me, and we chatted for a bit till we reached the road crossing  at US 19, the halfway point of the hike.  Warren was there checking in our group, as there was no one hiking southbound today.  He gave me a Coke, and another man who was there doing trail magic gave one to Lizzie.  She calculated that she had hiked nearly 2.5 miles per hour that morning, even with the fight against the wind up the Hump mountains.  I sat and ate my pumpkin seeds and realized that I hadn't brought enough snacks for the day.  Lizzie gave me a packet of cheese crackers which I kept for later.
After lunch I crossed the road into a different world.  The woods there were not nearly as muddy or treacherous, and it was normal hiking in sunshine up and down hills.  At one point the trail crossed several grassy meadows, bordered by large shade trees.  At another it followed along a ridge.  It was former farmland and had a very pleasant domestic feel to it.  It reminded me very much of the ridge behind my old house.  I slowed down to enjoy this part but would like to have stayed there for hours.  There were lots of blackberry bushes in bloom, emitting a lovely fragrance.  There was also a lot of multiflora rose which, even though a terrible invasive species, was also giving off a delightful smell. 
 I decided to take the time to note what wildflowers I saw here.  (As we're getting farther North spring is not as advanced as it was farther south.). Here's what I saw: yarrow, milk vetch, red clover, golden ragwort, buttercup, butter and eggs, hop clover, chickweed, bluets, phlox, dandelions, wild geraniums, mayapples, sweet pea, yellow hawkweed, gray beardtongue, clintonia lily, Queen Anne 's lace, mountain laurel, rhododendron, and jack in the pulpit.  
I thoroughly enjoyed walking through these woods.  I heard rufous-sided towhees, red-bellied woodpeckers, pileated woodpeckers, and veerys.  I got a close look at an indigo bunting that flew right in front of me when the trail emerged from the woods and followed a river through a grassy meadow.  I continue to hear the bird that sings, ""to-wheat, to-wheat, to wheat-e-o.""  I've been trying to remember what it is for two weeks but still can't remember.  
As always on these long days, the end of the hike took forever.  Even though I passed several beautiful waterfalls I was ready to be done for the day.  The final several miles was uphill.  I sometimes hear the Cole Porter song, ""Siberia"", when coming up hills.  It has just the right tempo for the pace I go, but it has become an earworm.  I need a replacement for it, wonderful as it is.  
I'm finally camped out again in my own cozy tent.  It has dried out, as have my rain jacket and poncho.  Just in time for rain tomorrow.","Yellow Mountain Gap

This is in keeping with my new efficiency rule: no single purpose stops.  To save time, when I stop I drink water, eat a snack, pee, clean hands, put more snacks in pocket, add or subtract clothing if needed, and check for cell service. AT&T service remains poor here.  I can usually get enough signal to email my journal entry but not enough to send texts or make a phone call.The rain was not due until 3:00, and I estimated I could reach our stopping place at 2:45.  I did.  Arlene and I were planning to go to a hostel tonight, but we've now pitched our tents here at the trailhead.  I walked up to a hostel .2 mile away, but it seemed disorganized and dark.  So I opted to tent instead.  It's now 6:30, and it still hasn't rained.  Maybe our luck has changed!The nature sightings for the day were few.  I saw a large black snake sunning itself on the trail, a box turtle using the trail for travel, and a red-spotted eft.   The grassy field I passed through at the end was full of daisies, the first big cluster of them I've seen.  There are lots of people out camping and hiking for Memorial Day weekend.  I met several large groups of campers today -- all ages.  One, a boy of about 7, was clearly excited to be doing such a grownup activity.  I'm not used to sharing the woods with anyone at the end of the day, so it's a little disconcerting to have so many people around.I forgot to send thanks to the folks who sent me goodies at Erwin, TN, our last mail pickup.  Thanks to Tony for the baked goods.  I share them with the others in the group, and we all enjoy them.  Thanks to Diane for ordering my purple suspenders (new plan to hold my pants up without having pins on both sides). And special thanks to my former coworkers at the Attorney General's Tax Division.  They sent both cookies and a card with all kinds of encouraging messages.  And ongoing thanks to all who sign my guestbook each day.  When I email my journal entry to Diane to post, I check email, so I do get your words of encouragement.  When you sign the book, please sign your name.  Sometimes the message arrives with a note that the email address is invalid, so if you don't sign I don't know who wrote the message.  Like the one I got the day before yesterday, which could be from Randy or Gene, both of whom hiked with me in Maine.Yesterday I got a note from Scott, our member who had to go home to deal with a heart fibrillation issue.  His surgery is Tuesday, May 30.  He hopes to join us when we reach Waynesboro, VA (best case scenario) or Pine Grove Furnace, PA (worst case scenario).  He has spoken to Terri, our other member who is home nursing a hurt knee.  It appears she may join us when we get close to the White Mountains (NH).  Tomorrow is a short day (8.6 miles) and maybe a town stop.  My most recent shower was last Sunday.  You can imagine how I look and smell.  I'm hoping for a shower, laundry, restaurant food, and grocery shopping.","Walnut Mountain Rd.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566611,"Today was a relatively short hiking day but a long day altogether.  This was a town day in Mountain City, TN.  We hiked 8.6 miles, then drove the van to the Appalachian Folk School (where Warren lives), stopping along the way to eat at a Mexican restaurant.  When we got to the Folk School  we unloaded our bins and packs and headed back to Mountain City to do laundry and buy groceries. Although we finished hiking around 12:30, we didn't get to sit down and take a break till about 8:30 this evening.We'll be staying at the Folk School for the next few days in a bunkhouse and being shuttled to the starting point of the hikes each day.  It's a terrific advantage because we can get a shower each day and have some real (restaurant) food.  Tomorrow we're leaving at 5 AM to allow us time to eat breakfast at a restaurant along the way.  My hikes go so much better when I've had a substantial amount of food and coffee before starting out.  In my real life I made a double espresso each morning, and I miss coffee terribly.  Today was the first day I got off the trail by accident.  Those who have read my journal will recall when I was hiking in Virginia in January I got off the trail about once a day, but up to today I had a good record here.  About a mile into the hike I came to a place where a trail was cut through high rocks.  I went straight ahead.  About half a mile past there I saw Bill heading toward me.  He said we were on a blue-blazed trail.  I looked and, sure enough, there were no white blazes, just blue ones.  (The AT is marked with white blazes; blue blazes are side trails such as trails to shelters and the like.)  We turned around and headed in the opposite direction till we saw a white blaze.  We had missed the double white blaze, indicating a turn in the trail, so I missed the turn downhill to Laurel Falls (see photo above).  The trail was a set of steep stone steps down to the Falls.  The falls were beautiful, and the trail continued along rocky ledges for quite a while following a river.When I got about halfway up the mountain of the day I checked for cell service and found that I had 5 bars.  Immediately messages and emails appeared. The first was one from a quilting friend saying that she understood one of my quilts had won an Award of Merit from the National Association of Certified Quilt Judges.  She wanted to know whether the group could have permission to post a picture of the quilt on the NACQA website and publish a picture of it in their journal.  I hadn't even known I'd won the award.  This was the first instance of my two worlds colliding.  It felt strange to be hiking up a mountain trying to figure out how to print out and send a photo release.  The last news of the day is that I had a shower.  I hadn't had one since last Sunday, 8 days ago. You can't imagine how clean I felt when I got out.  Sometimes when we go into restaurants in town we just marvel at the pure pleasure of sticking our hands in the sink and having hot water to get them clean.  Tomorrow another hike, another restaurant meal, and 20.5 more miles.","Dennis Cove, USFS 50

For the next 1600 miles it is about one-third up, one-third flat, and one-third down.  This was our first day hiking in this terrain, and it was noticeably less difficult than most of the places we've hiked so far.  Lizzie is now staying with the rest of the group at the Folk School so we all started hiking at the same time.  We left at 5 AM to allow time for a breakfast stop.  I haven't eaten breakfast at McDonald's in many years, and I was amazed at the high calorie count for the menu items.  I had a sausage biscuit and orange juice for about 600 calories - good for me because I'm trying to keep up my weight but pretty bad for a person of normal physical exercise. Even so, I was ravenous after only three hours.  Rennie told me last night that he'd hike with me today.  We started out with Lizzie also.  I had had a substantial amount of coffee, not to mention real food, so I started out at a faster than usual pace in the lead.  (I'm the slower hiker, so if he wanted to hike with me he had to go at my pace.). The hike first followed the shoreline of Watauga Lake.  This is a flood control lake built by the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s.  Because it was created by flooding, the shoreline is irregular and winds around quite a bit.  Then the trail crosses one of the dams and heads uphill to a ridge.  The rest of the hike was along a ridge that was mildly undulating up and down.  Lizzie and I made a number of stops early on, and by mile six Rennie gave up on us and went ahead.We kept up a good pace, occasionally stopping to look out over the lake. Because the trees are fully leafed out there were not many places where we could get a view of the lake.  Around 10 o'clock we reached a shelter that was up high and had a nice view.  We were both hungry, so we stopped and had lunch.  I had a much more substantial lunch than usual: whole wheat tortilla with pepperoni and cheddar cheese wrapped in it, baby carrots, and a Heath bar.  I had many more snacks with me, but I didn't eat them all.  This distance is still a challenge for us, and I was fading, so Lizzie took the lead and we churned out the miles to the end.  We were in altered states.  Lizzie says she just zones out and goes.  I think my mental state is similar.  Toward the end nothing matters but finishing.  We did see one interesting landmark, Nick Grindstone's Monument (see photo). Apparently Nick finished out his life, after earlier disappointments, atop the mountain with his pet dog and pet snake.  The monument is the remains of a brick fireplace.  On what would have been the open side there is a gravestone with his name and dates.  Below that is the epitaph, ""Lived alone, suffered alone, died alone.""  Guess he didn't think much of his dog.  In front of the monument is what appears to be a big cement crypt.When we arrived at the end I recognized the trailhead as the place I very first set foot on the Appalachian Trail just a year ago.  The first several miles of tomorrow's hike will cover that same ground.  I remember last year's hike as being at the peak of the spring wildflower season.  I'm a week later this year, but I still expect it to be lovely.  Tomorrow we hike 21.5 miles and finish the state of Tennessee.    
By the way, Rennie thinks I'd look just like Ma Kettle if only I had a corn cob pipe.  My poor hat got tossed in the dryer by accident and is permanently rumpled.  My suspenders hold up my pants when pockets are filled with snacks.","Watauga Lake, US 321/TN 67

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566892,"Today was another long day.  Although Warren listed the mileage as 21.5, the current distance according to AWOL is 21.7.  I think the discrepancy may be because Warren is using a 2015 Data Book.  Some sections of the trail have been regraded to provide more switchbacks, which adds length.  We started an hour later than yesterday because Warren said it was an easier section.  But really, once you've gone about 17 miles, every additional mile is hard, no matter what the terrain.We started in an open pasture, then went through a fence into a field full of cows.  There were lots of one- or two-month old calves that were cute.  They were curious about humans but ran when we got close.  Lizzie got very excited and exclaimed that getting to be with the cows wiped out all the bad parts of the hike that came before.  She claims that cows are her spirit animal.From there we passed into some woods that were much like the previous 400 miles, and we walked in them for 20 more miles.  Boring!  We missed the peak of the spring wildflowers.  There were just a few late-blooming geraniums. In various places honeysuckle was in bloom, and that scent was lovely.  I also saw an interesting bird that was gray-blue with white underbelly.  I'm wondering if it's the Tennessee blue warbler.  Yesterday near Watauga Lake we saw signs that we may see large equipment being used to create/recreate habitat for this warbler that's becoming scarce.  Although I started with LIzzie, she sped on after a few miles.  At 1:30 I reached a shelter and stopped for lunch at a picnic table in the sun.  After a few minutes Arlene and Bill arrived.  I calculated at that point that I was maintaining a pace of two miles an hour and estimated my finish time as 6:40.  This turned out to be just about right.  The trail was located along the spine of a high ridge that we hiked on all day. Even though we were up high, there were no places where we could get a view.  The one interesting sight of the day was an old disused shelter (see photo).  I had planned to have lunch there, but when I arrived it was too creepy.  It was small and dark and littered with the remnants of a partially torn up Sue Grafton mystery.  A pristine Ziploc bag was filled with religious tracts, each in its own smaller Ziploc.  The outer bag had a note, ""Read here or take with you.""Late in the afternoon I finally reached the Tennessee/Virginia border.  This was an altogether more satisfying marker than those at the previous two borders. There was a nice wooden sign and an actual physical line made of piled up stones (see photo).  Shortly after passing the border it started to rain.  Fortunately this was just a light shower, not the downpours that we've previously experienced, and it passed after 45 minutes.  So I arrived in Damascus weary but in good spirits. The trail in Damascus goes through the city park and right down the main street of town. I'm glad to have finished Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.  This all seems to be moving so fast.  We'll be in Virginia for the next 550 miles.  We talked to our absent member Scott tonight for a long time.  He had his surgery today and seems in good spirits.  Tomorrow he meets with his doctor to make a plan for recovery.  I hope he can come back before too much time passes. Tomorrow we have a very short day: 5.6 miles.  This will give us time to do some errands in Damascus and Mountain City.  I'm looking forward to some rest.","TN 91

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567036,"We were all looking forward to our short hike this morning - 5.6 miles, then breakfast in town.  Arlene wasn't hiking because she's already hiked this section, but the rest of us were.  Warren dropped us at the trail north of Damascus, and we started hiking south at 6:40 AM.  Rennie suggested we all hike together since it was a short hike, and we all started out together.  Lizzie soon got antsy though and took off ahead.  I was ahead of Rennie and Bill.  When I stopped to take off my fleece the two of them went ahead.  I hiked till I got to a T-intersection at the top of a hill. A sign there said Damascus 4 miles to the left and Iron Mountain Trail to the right. There was no reference to the Appalachian Trail, and I didn't see white blazes in either direction.  I hesitated but finally decided to turn left in the direction of Damascus.When I got higher on the hill my phone dinged for a text message.  It was Lizzie, wondering if she was on the wrong trail because she didn't see any of us behind her.  I told her where I had turned and had her describe the route she had taken. She had turned left at the very beginning of the hike at a place where a metal AT marker indicated Damascus south.  I realized I'd missed this crucial turn.  I called her and told her I was turning around and heading back to find the turn that I'd missed.  I headed downhill and arrived at the turn a few minutes before 8 o'clock.  It was exactly one-tenth of a mile into the day's hike -- meaning I'd just spent an hour and twenty minutes off the trail.  I headed up the hill on the turn.  This was yet another instance of missing  a double blaze indicating a turn.  It was a 90-degree turn, so it was easy to head straight forward onto Feathercamp Trail.  Lesson: always be looking for blazes instead of just following the trail.  I'm not sure how many times I'll have to learn and relearn this.  About 20 minutes after I headed up the hill I met Rennie coming downhill.  He and Bill had gone all the way to where Feathercamp Trail intersected with the Appalachian Trail and only then realized that they'd gone astray.  Bill followed shortly thereafter.  Altogether my failure to note the double blaze cost us an hour and a half in extra hiking.  I finally got to town at 10 o'clock and went into Mojo's Trailside Café for breakfast.  Rennie and Bill arrrived not long after.  I ordered a bagel with lox and cream cheese, a big glass of milk, and coffee.  This was major food that made me very happy.  I didn't get hungry till five hours later.  In the afternoon we scattered to do our various errands.  I spent several hours at the Johnson County Public Library printing out the release form I need for the NACQJ publication, finding directions for my friends Kathy and Frank to pick me up next Tuesday, and updating my phone software.  Bill went to Walmart to get hiking shoes.  Lizzie took her car to Johnson City to meet her brother for lunch and shop for a smaller backpack.  Rennie stayed at the Folk School.We cooked dinner together at the Folk School: pasta with marinara sauce and mushrooms, meat to add in for the non-vegetarians, garlic bread, and ice cream and strawberries for dessert.  Afterward we watched ""Circle of Dreams"", a documentary film about Warren's 1990 AT Expedition.  This was a ""circle"" expedition in which the participants pledged to each other that all would finish the trail.  It was interesting to see what these hikers said about their reasons for hiking the trail and what they got from doing it.  The filmmakers interviewed them at Springer Mountain, in Virginia about 650 miles in, and the day before they finished at Katahdin.   One man said the trail had given him the most clarity of mind he'd ever had.  One said it taught him to slow down, live in the moment, and enjoy what's happening.  Another said he'd learned that you have to give love unselfishly in order to receive love.  The ages of the participants ranged from 22 to 68.  Very interesting.  I am hoping to be able to have a quiet mind and to relax and enjoy some of the wonderful places we see.  But somehow I'm still rushing.  Sometimes I have an earworm, music playing in my head in the background, and thoughts on top of that. I definitely don't have the quiet mind I aspire to.  In fact, my mind was quieter at the beginning of the hike -- maybe because it took all my effort just to accomplish the physical work of completing the miles.  When I start in the morning, especially on a sunny day, I feel so fortunate and grateful that I have this opportunity to be in the woods each morning and spend my day walking through beauty.  Bill says he's never felt so free in his life.  
Tomorrow we hike 18.4 miles over a beautiful bald called Whitetop Mountain.  It will be only Rennie, LIzzie, and me.  It should be interesting.","US 58, Feathercamp Branch

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567070,"Today was a hard slog, but I'm recovering now.  We were to leave the house at 5:30 AM, but I couldn't find my hiking stick.  I had last seen it in the white van, but I couldn't find it in the dark.  Warrren, aggravated, went to the van and got another stick for me to use.  He dropped Rennie, Lizzie, and me at Elk Garden, and we headed south.  Lizzie took the lead, and Rennie said he'd follow me.  I don't do well with this setup.  Although Rennie can slow his pace to mine, he never takes a break and doesn't stop to take pictures.  So I felt inhibited to make stops.  The pole that Warren lent me was terrible.  It was collapsible, and each time I planted it in mud one joint came completely apart.  Each time I had to stop to put it back together.  There were a lot of muddy spots, and I had to stop repeatedly.  After about 100 such stops (not an exaggeration) Rennie unrolled some duct tape from his pole and taped over the bad joint.  The repair was only partially successful, and I continued to have to keep pushing it together. Finally, about 6 miles from the end it snapped at the joint, and I was left with no stick.  I walked a few miles keeping my eye out for an appropriate tree limb, but most of what I saw was either waterlogged or rotten.  Finally Rennie found a heavy but serviceable long stick for me to use.  All of this woe was compounded by my decision to go without ibuprofen for the day and my twisting my left knee after tripping over a root.  Ever since we started doing the 20-mile days my knees have been sore.  I've been taking ibuprofen round the clock.  Yesterday after only hiking 5.6 miles my knees felt fine without the medication.  I decided to go without ibuprofen for the day to see what kind of shape my knees are actually in.  They did fine for the first five miles, which were uphill, but once the downhill started they really hurt.  I was having a klutzy day and tripped and stumbled a lot.  In one mud hole I tripped over a root.  My gyrations to avoid falling resulted in twisting my left knee.  I had just spent a week babying it after a previous twist.  Now I was back at the beginning again.  Not all was misery, however.  We crossed over Whitetop Mountain.  At Buzzard Rock there were 360-degree views of the mountains around us (see photo).  It was a clear sunny day, and it was beautiful.  The wind was blowing quite hard, so we didn't stay long.  Most of the rest of the hike was through woods -- mostly rhododendron, but occasionally tall evergreens.  Part of the trail coincided with the Virginia Creeper Trail, a rail trail that's heavily used by bicyclists.  In this section there were two elaborate footbridges, which I'm sure were very costly to build.  Near the end of the hike the trail followed a rushing stream.  We've been staying at the Appalachian Folk School all week.  This is Warren's organization.  We've been staying in bunkhouses in real beds and having access to real toilets and showers.  Tomorrow that ends, and we'll be back to camping.  The weather forecast for the next several days looks good, so maybe we'll have some enjoyable time in our tents.  One last note about the Folk School: all week a scrawny black cat has been hanging around interviewing for an owner.  It's universally friendly and sweet, so Bill has been feeding it.  At first it was aggressively friendly and spent a lot of time trying to get into our food bins, but over the course of the week it has learned not to get into the bins and not to go into the house.  Even Arlene and Lizzie who dislike cats have weakened.  Lizzie, who named the cat Go Away, fed it a whole carton of milk this evening.  Tomorrow we're headed to the Grayson Highlands, where the wild ponies live. I'll be taking Ibuprofen.","Elk Garden, VA 600

Warren chastised me for trying to keep up with Rennie and Lizzie, saying that going too fast is the cause of injuries.  (He also lent me a double strap knee support to try on my left knee.)  I told Rennie I was uncomfortable hiking with him behind me, and he went ahead.   Lizzie left while I was in the bathroom (fancy trailhead parking lot!).  I set out up the hill through a pasture filled with cows and cow manure.  The day was quite cold , maybe 50, and I had not brought my fleece.  I looked in my backpack for any extra layers and found only my fingerless gloves that I use to prevent sunburn on my hands.  I was moving really slowly because I hadn't had enough sleep and hadn't had any coffee.  And I was cold.  After a while I caught up with Lizzie, who had waited for me.  At the end of an hour we had only gone 1.2 miles.  I stopped to rummage in the snack section of my backpack for the fruit gummies that have 50 milligrams of caffeine per serving but didn't find it.  We plodded on.There were nice views on the way to the shelter four miles in.  Right after the shelter we saw our first wild ponies.  The Grayson highlands were bald when the settlers arrived there, and they continued to keep the land open by burning and by grazing livestock there.  In the 1960s ponies were introduced in order to keep the vegetation down.  At six miles we entered Grayson Highlands State Park.  Everything in this park was well-marked and well-kept.  The next animals we saw were longhorn cattle -- quite a surprise.  Right across the trail from them were several mares with their foals.  They were handsome animals, much prettier and healthy-looking than I'd expected.  These ponies seemed indifferent to us, although one came close to the trail and allowed Lizzie to pet her.  They didn't seek food though.The highland was rolling hills with low vegetation, some rock formations, and lots of rhododendron just starting to bloom.  There were also dark stunted evergreens. On one hillside they were one-sided from the wind always blowing in the same direction.  There was some rock climbing, and we went  through a passage called Fatman Squeeze.  The park was a really lovely place with bright pink blooms contrasting against gray rock formations (see photo).  I stopped many times to take pictures.  Then we rounded a corner and came upon yet another group of ponies.  These were much more interested in people.  One of them approached me, smelling the snacks I had in my pocket, and started to bite through my jacket.  I backed away.  A group of Amish men and women were headed up in the other direction.  We saw quite a few family groups out hiking today.  We passed the 500 mile marker, and Lizzie and I sat down to have lunch in the sun.  We continued to see groups of ponies: mares and their foals under a tree, a stallion drinking from a stream in the woods.  The terrain also changed as we hiked on.  On the other side of the mountain there were a lot of cinnamon ferns and other low-growing vegetation.  Then we came upon a large thicket of flaming azalea (pinkster plant), glowing orange against the bright blue sky.  Although my left knee hurt some in the morning, it felt better as the day continued. I took ibuprofen and tried to use the knee cautiously.  By the end of the day I felt quite good.  This was an amazingly nice day - perhaps the best one of the hike so far.  Tonight we are at last camped in our own tents.  Tomorrow we head to Mt.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567350,"Thru hiking the Appalachian Trail certainly has its ups and downs.  Yesterday was probably the best day of the whole hike, and today I'm in a slough of despond.  The thought crossed my mind today - for the very first time - that I may not be able to finish this hike.  I'm not thinking of quitting, but I've had so many falls and injuries I'm beginning to wonder if my body can hold together long enough to do it.  Before I started, I told myself that if the hike began to do me permanent bodily harm, I would have the good sense to quit and go home.  Tonight I gave up that good sense.  I've already done more than 800 miles, more than a third of the trail.  I'm not going home unless I can't move.  I know this is a bit crazy, but it requires a certain kind of craziness to do a thru hike.  I had my tent packed up and was on the trail at 6:30.  There was a long uphill, which was good because I didn't want to strain my hurt left knee.  I walked carefully, almost gingerly.  At the end of an hour I had gone 1.7 miles, which is decent.  I put the knee straps on for the long downhill, and my knee felt fine.  About eight miles in I started thinking about ways to prevent further injury to my left knee.  Long ago, in my running days, a sports podiatrist told me that my left leg is a quarter inch longer than my right.  Because of this the left knee and hip hit the ground harder than the right and are prone to injury.  He remedied this in the context of running by putting a quarter-inch lift in my right shoe underneath the orthotics.  Rennie had suggested that if I hiked with my stick in my left hand maybe my arms and shoulders would absorb some of the shock that would otherwise go to my knee and hip.  I decided to try using my hiking stick in my left hand.  I was trying this out when my left leg tripped over a rock, and I went flying.  I landed hard on my left wrist, and my right foot landed outstretched upside down.  It hurt so much I gasped.  Then I carefully righted myself and sat on the ground for a moment to collect myself.  I checked my right knee, and it was again scraped up.  My left wrist hurt a lot. I got up and continued on.Less than a mile later I reached a road at Dickey Gap, where hikers Gin Gin and Gadget were doing trail magic.  They were giving out Powerade, yogurt, bananas, apples, donut holes, and cinnamon rolls.  I took a break there and chatted with them while I ate.  They were getting ready to leave for the day and urged me to eat or take as much as I wanted.  I cleaned up my skinned knee and put a bandaid on.  Gin Gin wrapped my wrist with athletic tape to stabilize it.  A large knot had started to form between my thumb and my wrist.  They offered to drive me to my end point for the day, but I needed to finish the miles.  When I got back on the trail at 12:30 I had 13.9 miles left to hike.  Two miles past there I met Lizzie headed south.  She was headed to her car and could get ice for my wrist.  She suggested we look at it after we iced it to decide whether I should go to the emergency room and that I sleep in the van to save time on setting up camp.  We have another very long day tomorrow: 23.4 miles. I knew the remainder of the hike was going to take a very long time, and it did. Later on my right ankle and leg really started to hurt also.  I pulled up my pant leg and rolled down my sock but I didn't see any injures.  The front of the ankle is very tender.  I think I've pulled muscles or tendons in my right ankle and sprained my left wrist.  Now that the tape is off I can see that the wrist is very swollen.  I didn't get to the road where the van was parked until just before 8:00.  Lizzie was headed back out on the trail looking for me as I arrived at Partnership Shelter, right before the place where the van was parked.  She and Rennie helped get me situated in the van for the night.  Lizzie bought ice in town and made an ice pack for my ankle.  I'm sleeping on the box. Rennie and I are planning to leave at first light.  Lizzie will again be hiking south and has a lot of car shuttling to do.  One good thing about the day: when I got to a ridge close to the end I was finally able to get cell coverage and talk to my sister Diane for a few minutes. This is the first cell service I've had for two days.  Keep those good words coming.  I need them.","Fox Creek, VA 603

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567559,"I set my alarm for 5:15 this morning to be ready to leave at 6:00, but Rennie's went off an hour earlier.  No problem - I went right back to sleep.  The plan was for Warren to take Rennie and me to the endpoint, Garden Mountain, to hike south for the day.  This made much of our hike downhill.  The primary motivation, I think, was to avoid taking the white van up the mountain.  The road was so rutted in places that it was almost impassible.  On the drive Warren scolded me for not eating enough and losing too much weight.  He's noticed what I eat and it's way too healthy to have enough calories.  I must make friends with Little Debbie and eat a lot of ice cream.  I'm all on board with the ice cream, but we've had very few opportunities to indulge. And he's right that I need to eat a whole lot more food.  It was about 60 degrees and raining when we started at 6:40.  I had brought a rain jacket and a poncho.  Warren said the first five miles were the hardest, so I decided to wear the jacket to avoid the billowing poncho getting in the way of my view.  We started in drizzle, but then the rain got heavier.  We were completely drenched within 15 minutes.  It turned out we walked 10 hours in the rain.   There were a few intermittent periods of drizzle and of downpour, but most of the day was just a steady moderate downfall.  I proceeded very cautiously for the first five miles because there were lots of rocks and muddy places.  After that the terrain was easier, and I was able to go at a normal speed, taking into consideration all the mud and slippery places. As always I was afraid of being cold, and I had no extra layer with me for when we stopped.  We stayed warm till the first stop, and then we both got cold.  Everything is more complicated because of my sprained wrist.  Because of it I can't squat down and hang on to a tree to poop in the woods, so I had to wait 7 miles to get to a privy.  Because my pants won't stay up without suspenders I have to nearly undress to use the privy.  By the time I was done I was thoroughly chilled.  For a while we hiked through pasture, where it was windy. Momentarily I succumbed to fear that the wind would make us even colder.  I stopped and put on my poncho over my thoroughly wet rain jacket.  That made me a bit warmer, and I put my left arm inside the poncho to make it a bit warmer.  Eventually we got to an uphill, and I warmed up.  It was not fun, however.  Water was dripping from the end of my nose and rolling down my face.  I started drinking the water that reached my lips, and it was quite good.  Sometimes pieces of music would play in my head.  One that goes, ta da DUM ta da DUM ta da DUM ta da DUM, DAH DAH DAH DAH, da da da da DAH da has been floating through my mind for days now.  I finally figured out that it's part of the score for ""The African Queen"".  Where did THAT come from?  Then my brain switched to Cole Porter's ""Two Little Babes in the Woods"": ""they have found that the fountain of youth is a mixture of gin and vermouth..."". I used to worry about all these strange musical interludes, but I've decided to just regard them as entertainment and listen or not as I prefer. Diane says I'm living in an alternate universe, and that's probably true.  Tomorrow will be my last hike with the group for seven days.  My class reunion at Middlebury College is this upcoming weekend, and I'm going to go see my old friends and my roomie Meg who's been so supportive and who makes the best cookies.  In order to take this break I had to hike the scheduled miles in advance.  That's why my mile counter is higher than the mile of the trail we're on.  There are lots of general trail things that I've not had time to write about, so I may write some entries while I'm gone.  I hope to see one of my classmates who thruhiked about 15 years ago and who was one of my inspirations for this journey.  And I plan to have my wrist x-rayed to make sure it's not broken.  (My right knee and ankle are doing better; one more day of an ankle wrap and I should be fine.)Tomorrow 17.4 miles and then a well-deserved break!","Garden Mountain, VA 623

I got a good look at a chipping sparrow today and also saw a red-spotted eft, and a toad of some kind.We finished the hike a few minutes after 3 o'clock.  This puts our pace somewhere between two and two and a half miles per hour.  Warren asked Rennie this morning whether we had to use headlamps to finish yesterday, and Rennie told him we came in at 4:20.  I think I'm starting to get some street cred with Warren.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568420,"Although I had planned to write several entries while I was off the trail resting, I found that I was too busy having fun to write.  When my friends Kathy and Frank dropped me off last Tuesday night a wave of real happiness washed over me as I came in my front door.  After weeks of being in the woods, grungy hostels, and cheap motels my house seemed so clean, so beautiful, so serene.My main task the next day was to get my wrist checked.  I got up early, took a shower, and headed to Med Express.  It was a clear warm day in Charleston, and the city looked radiant to me.  My positive reaction surprised me because I often think I should leave Charleston.  But that day the city just charmed me.  I felt so happy to be here.The Med Express x-rays showed something, but the doctor wasn't sure it was a break.  He referred me to a walk-in orthopedic clinic that was open that afternoon. I arrived at the clinic half an hour before the posted hours, and the waiting room was crowded and noisy.  A television was playing loudly, and the waiting patients were talking more loudly to be heard over the sound of the television. Nearly every seat was taken.  Three toddlers in casts were playing boisterously and occasionally crying.  The noise level was overwhelming - especially in comparison to the woods where I've spent most of my time lately.  Finally, after waiting an hour and a half, I escaped to an examination room.  A nurse interviewed me, then took my x-rays.  Shortly thereafter a physician's assistant came in and told me I had a ""nondisplaced fracture of the left distal radius.""  I would have to be in a short cast for three weeks, then in a splint for three more weeks.  I chose a pretty shade of purple for the cast.  It was actually a relief to get the cast because it's now clear that the wrist can't be used right now, and the cast prevents me from even trying.  Also, my wrist is somewhat protected from further injury.Much of the day I felt unbearably sleepy and yearned to lie down to take a nap. I never got the chance.  Getting a haircut, having dinner with my friends Susan and Doug, and packing for the weekend took the rest of the day.On Thursday I got up at 4:30 AM to get an early flight to Vermont.  My college roommate Meg picked me up at the airport in Burlington.  It was the first warm and sunny day of the spring/summer in Vermont.  We took advantage of it by heading to Splash!, a restaurant at the boathouse on Lake Champlain.  The food was excellent and the view superb.  From our table beside the water we saw a long breakwater, a small lighthouse, big beautiful boats, the lake, and the Adirondack Mountains on the other side of the lake in New York.   After lunch we headed to Meg's house in East Montpelier.  We had a relaxing evening there with her husband, and I got to bed early.  I didn't wake up till 8:30 the next day.  On Friday Meg and I drove to Middlebury, stopping at an outfitter along the way to look for a sunhat to replace the one that got permanently wrinkled and melted in the dryer.  No luck.  We arrived at our class reunion registration headquarters in time for our shift as greeters.  While we were there our classmate Moore (trail name Morph), who through-hiked the AT in 2003, arrived.  We talked about the trail, and he taught me the thru hiker's prayer: You keep lifting them up, I'll keep putting them down.  From there we went to our friend Cecelia's house.  Cecelia married one of our professors right after college graduation and has lived in Middlebury ever since. Even so, she hasn't attended reunions, and we haven't seen her very often. She invited her old roommate Ruth, our friend Grace, Meg, and me to stay at her house.  Ruth and her husband came, but Grace couldn't.  We figured we hadn't all been together for 30 years.  We had a long dinner that night and got caught up on those missing 30 years.  Saturday was another perfect  summer day, warm and sunny.  Meg and I went to the Middlebury Museum of Art to see an exhibit of Sabra Field prints.  They were wonderful.  Then at 11:00 we met Moore and several other people to hike up Snake Mountain.  This was a gratifying hike.  It's neither long nor difficult, and the view from the top of the mountain is beautiful.  The mountain overlooks the neatly-divided fields and farms of Addison County, a scene of pastoral loveliness, with Lake Champlain and the mountains of New York in the distance (see photo).  We sat at the top and ate our picnic lunches.  There were other activities that day, but the hike was the highlight.Yesterday Meg and I stopped at the Vermont Book Shop on the way out of Middlebury, and I bought several books that seem like candidates for bedtime reading on the trail.  So far I haven't had enough time to read in bed on the trail, but I'm hoping that as I get more skilled at hiking I will have time.  Not having enough energy to read before I sleep is one of the worst things about being on the trail.  I've been reading myself to sleep ever since I first learned to read around age 7.  On the other hand, being so sleepy that I fall right to sleep and don't wake all night is one of the best things about the trail.  I had an uneventful trip home from Vermont today.  Tomorrow I'm headed back to join the Expedition members in Catawba, Virginia at mile 708.3 of the trail. After nearly a week not hiking I feel well-rested and ready to go again.  On Wednesday my friends Glenn and Susan will join me for the hike up to McAfee Knob.  They'll be the first of my friends to hike part of the trail with me.","East Montpelier, VT

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568549,"I came back to the trail today and will hike tomorrow.  My time off has really benefited my physical condition.  When I walk nothing hurts - no knee or ankle pain.  I feel rested.  We have three consecutive 20-mile days coming up, so let's hope I can hold onto this state of pain-free relaxation.My friend Susan M-M picked me up at 10 o'clock this morning and drove me to Lewisburg, WV.  My other friend Susan M fixed us lunch there.  Then she and her husband Glenn drove me to VA 311 in Catawba, Virginia.  This will be our starting point tomorrow.  Tonight we're staying at Howard Johnson's in Daleville.  It's a town stop, and folks are getting showers for the first time in many days.  We plan to stay here tomorrow night also.  The weather forecast for this area is for thunderstorms all week.  I'm all for avoiding camping in the rain.  When my friends Kathy and Frank picked me up last week to take me home Kathy was full of questions about group members: Where are Bill and Arlene? Are they still in the group?  You haven't written about Lizzie, where is she? Why were just you and Rennie hiking?  It was almost like she was asking about characters in a book.  So, at long last, here's an introduction to the cast of characters:Warren Doyle, organizer of the Expedition, has hiked the AT from end to end 17 times.  He believes that the best way to hike the trail is by doing day hikes rather than carrying a lot of gear and backpacking.  He started the Appalachian Folk School, where he teaches classes in how to hike the AT and hosts contradancing dances.  He's been active in the long-distance hiking community for many years, is a founder of the Appalachian Long Distance Hiking Association (ALDHA), and is a legend of the trail.  For more info, check out his website at www.warrendoyle.com.  Arlene Rios (Staples), age 40, is from San Gabriel, California.  She is newly retired from the U.S. Navy, which she joined at age 17.  She's a few credits short of a degree in Human Resources but isn't sure that's what she wants to do.  She's a city person and had never gotten close to a cow before the hike.  She may be the only person in history who hoped to hike the entire AT without seeing any wildlife.  She sees the humor in every situation and laughs a lot.  Difficulties don't faze her.  She's calm and determined.  She's probably the kindest person in the group.  She's at a transition point in her life.Lizzie Vinson, age 38, grew up in Florida but has spent most of her adult life in Asheville, North Carolina.  She has a degree in sociology and has worked at many different jobs.  She has been director of a Girl Scout camp and has worked at a locked facility for troubled teenagers.  She quit her job to do the hike.  She likes snakes but always wants to see them before they see her.  She identifies the snakes and lizards that we see on the trail.  She'll go out of her way to avoid stepping on a bug but named a friend's cat Stupid.  She is curious about a lot of things and sometimes ponders which things she'd eat if stranded on the trail.  The 3-inch-long millipedes that are dark maroon are prime candidates, she thinks.  Once when we came upon a baby mouse that was dying she gave it water.  She has a very active mind and will happily split a quart of milk at any time.  Bill Shelton (Pilgrim Billbones), age 59, grew up in eastern Kentucky and has spent his life in the tristate area (Portsmouth, OH; Ashland, KY; Huntington, WV).  He has a degree in electrical engineering and just retired from working in the quality control lab of a steel manufacturing company.  He's witty and funny and loves telling stories.  When he laughs you can see the gap between his two front teeth.  He once told me that what he'd most like to do after retirement is get a Ph.D. In mathematics.  He usually hikes with Arlene and never skips any side trails that promise something interesting.  He says he's felt more free on the trail than at any other time in his life.  Rennie Marisa (Lost Sole), age 66, grew up in eastern Pennsylvania but now lives in Holiday, Florida.  He is retired from the National Guard, where he maintained and repaired complicated equipment such as Blackhawk helicopters.  He has a hearing loss as a result of time spent driving tanks on active duty.  He is an experienced mountain climber and long-distance runner and is very fit.  Hiking the AT is not on his bucket list; he's just hiking to get out of the house.  He's done everything he wants to do in life, has no bucket list, and would be satisfied if he dies tonight.  He leaves in the morning as soon as it's light enough to see without a headlamp and hikes without stopping until he reaches the endpoint for the day.  He doesn't stop to look at views or to eat or rest.  He usually arrives at the endpoint several hours before the rest of the group.  He doesn't go to bed until everyone has reached the end of the day's hike. Charli Fulton (Sturdy Peasant), age 67, grew up in Dover-Foxcroft, ME and Brookfield, WI.  My undergraduate degree is in American literature.  For most of my working life I practiced law in various do-gooder positions: consumer protection at the WV Attorney General's office, criminal defense at county and federal public defender office, special education and mental health law at the WV protection and advocacy agency.  For the past 30 years I've made quilts.  I mostly design my own art quilts that are meant to be hung on a wall rather than used on a bed.  I'm particularly interested in fabric dyeing using shibori methods.  I love being in the woods and have studied wildflowers and birds for much of my life.  Group update:  I talked to Scott Grabe yesterday.  His final follow-up appointment with the doctor is on June 26.  He hopes to join us on the trail on June 27 and start hiking the next day.","home

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568712,"It was so good to get back to the woods.  We met in the breakfast room at 6 AM and were to be shuttled from the hotel in Daleville to VA 311 in Catawba. Warren told me he had my pack and hiking stick outside, that I should pick them up.  When I got outside he had the wrong stick.  By the time I walked to the white van and got my stick everyone was gathering to leave.  So I left my half-eaten breakfast, my hat, and my coffee in the breakfast room.Susan and Glenn hiked to McAfee Knob with me to get a flavor of the hike. They are the first guest hikers to join us other than alumni of previous expediitons.  The temperature was pleasant, and the trail was dry.  We started hiking at 7:00 and reached McAfee Knob before 10:00.  When we got there Lizzie, Arlene, Bill, and Randy were there.  We took a lot of pictures and were ready to leave at 10:00.  Glenn had brought a wildflower book and was planning to hike back to VA311 at a leisurely pace checking out flowers.  It was nice to spend some time with him and Susan and get caught up.  Susan, who is an accomplished birder, identified a whole lot of bird songs that I didn't know.  I asked her to provide a list of what she heard, and it is impressive: Carolina wren, cardinal, bluejay, scarlet tanager, peewee, blue-headed vireo, yellow-throated vireo, red-eyed vireo, chestnut-sided warbler, worm-eating warbler, black and white warbler, hooded warbler, ovenbird, red-bellied woodpecker, white-breasted nuthatch, great crested flycatcher, field sparrow, raven, rufous-sided towhee, wood thrush, indigo bunting, chimney swift, tufted titmouse, and Carolina chickadee.  The view from McAfee Knob was lovely,  but it was overtaken later in the day by the fabulous views from Tinker Cliff (see photo).  Susan and Glenn headed back to their car when we were ready to leave McAfee Knob, and I continued hiking with Arlene.  We walked along chatting and enjoying the sunny warm day.  As we proceeded we saw several kinds of wildflowers that I'd never seen before.  That was a treat, even though I had no way to look them up to identify them.  We walked through various pleasant floral fragrances throughout the day.  I looked around as we smelled each new fragrance, but I couldn't see what was in bloom.  About halfway through the hike we arrived at Tinker Cliffs.  The trail there goes along the edge of rock outcropping for about half a mile.  The view is of a farming valley running from left to right, several ranges of mountains to the left of the valley, and several more ranges of mountains to the right.  Clouds overhead made shadows on the mountains below.  It was really beautiful.  About 4:45 it started to rain - slowly at first, but then quite hard.  There was a lot of thunder and lightning - some of it quite close to where we were hiking along the top of the ridge.  There was nowhere to take shelter, and the storm continued for an hour.  After it let up we came upon a place where we saw clouds filling the valleys.  At one place along a power line right of way fog/cloud was blowing up the mountain and dissipating.  We got quite wet, but it wasn't cold out so it wasn't bad.We didn't finish till 8:30.  Today was a mail pickup day.  I received two packages from friends.  Lisa sent me a nice note and a package with several lightweight ponchos, hand warmers, and a box of KIND bars.  Lynda sent me a freeze-dried lasagna dinner.  Thanks to both of you for your words of encouragement and for the goodies.  I feel fortunate to be so rich in friends.  Bill and I walked across the street to Pizza Hut and had pizza and beer for dinner.  Tomorrow is another long day: 21.6 miles.  It starts with a meeting in the breakfast room at 5:30 AM.  It's going to be a short night.","VA 311, Catawba

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568837,"The day started with a group meeting at 5:30 AM.  Warren is going to be gone for three weeks starting tomorrow.  The meeting was to clarify how things will run while he's gone and to recruit one or more of the hikers to serve as the van driver.  Arlene was not in the running because she's the slowest hiker; I was not in the running because my broken wrist precludes my moving the 5-gallon water containers around.  In the end Rennie and Bill agreed to split the duties, and Lizzie and Patti agreed to help as needed.  I volunteered to hike with Arlene today.  One principle of our group is that the person who's last doesn't hike alone.  Bill has been hiking with Arlene all the time, and I thought this would give him a break and allow him to finish earlier. (Ironically, he finished about half an hour after us because he took a wrong turn.)  I set a pace of about one and three-quarters of a mile per hour.  This is my normal pace, and I thought Arlene would be able to keep up.  Also, I didn't want to be tempted to go faster: I want to preserve my pain-free knees for a while longer after my rest. I noticed when I hiked with Arlene and Bill yesterday that they take a lot of short breaks.  I hoped to get Arlene to finish earlier by setting a steady pace and limiting breaks to multipurpose ones.  The beginning of the hike took us through a farmer's field.  It was cloudy/foggy, so visibility was limited.  It felt strange, as though we were in a fairy tale.  We took our first break at Fullhart Knob Shelter,  about 5 miles into the hike.  In keeping with our multipurpose goal, we used the privy, ate snacks, drank water, texted/emailed, took our shoes off briefly, and socialized with the couple who was staying at the shelter.  Sherlock and Darwin started on March 9 - about 7 weeks ahead of our group - and are behind us as of the end of today.Arlene has been having a lot of foot pain, part of what keeps her moving slowly. Our whole group has hiked about 120 miles in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only Rennie is going to rehike these miles.  The rest of us will have 6 days off - to rest, hike ahead, or go home.  Arlene is thinking of going to Philadelphia for the break to try to get some shoes that don't hurt her feet.  I remembered that I know a hiker who lives in that part of the state.  I texted Robin and asked whether she or any of her hiker friends could recommend a sports podiatrist who could see Arlene during the week of the break.  As soon as I sent the text I lost cell service, so I don't know whether she can help or not.We decided to do a break at lunchtime and soak our feet in a cold stream.  I was hoping that this might help Arlene's feet.  We got too hungry to wait for an appropriate stream, however, so we sat on a log and ate lunch.  Then at the next stream we filled our water bottles and soaked our feet.  This was very refreshing, and we continued on in somewhat better shape. We continued hiking from one landmark to the next.  Late in the afternoon we reached the Blueridge Parkway at mile 97.  The AT stays near the parkway for about 100 miles, mostly parallel to the road either higher or lower than the road.  The main scenic views are at pulloffs for cars.  The trail crisscrosses the parkway at these locations.  The views were nice, indeed.  The weather forecast was for rain, with chances fairly low until noon then gradually increasing.  We hoped to get as far as we could before the rain started.  At one viewpoint the sky in the southwest and northwest showed rain. Even the view to the East showed rain.  Fortunately, we managed to hike in places that didn't get hit by rain.  We started hearing thunder around 4 o'clock, but the storms didn't seem close.  We managed to outrun the rain for the reminder of the hike, which we finished at 7:30.  We also got our tents set up before the rain started.  There's been intermittent rain since  8:00.  I hope it stops early enough in the night that our tents will dry out overnight.We continue to see lots of wildflowers, not whole hillsides of them but small clusters.  In addition to the ones I didn't know I saw daisies, wild roses, fire pinks, Deptford pinks, yarrow, trumpet creeper, and a cream and pink-colored vetch that I've never seen before.  Susan M, who hiked partway with us yesterday, says I need to include the butterflies I see.  Unfortunately, I haven't learned many butterflies, so I won't be adding them on this trip. Tomorrow is another long day, with rain predicted.  Here's hoping we get lucky on the timing of the rain again.","Daleville, US 220

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568944,"I woke this morning about 5:00 and discovered that my tent had collapsed on me during the night.  The condensation on the mosquito netting was getting my sleeping bag wet and didn't feel too good on my face either.  When I set my tent up last night I picked a place where there was a cushy bed of moss. Unfortunately the moss was on top of a rock, so I couldn't drive the stakes in very deep.  In the past I've gotten away with some loose staking, but last night my luck ran out.  I hauled myself out of the tent, put it back up, and went back to sleep till 5:45.This is the third consecutive 20-mile day, and I was very tired from the start.  I hiked the first half of the day with Arlene and Bill.  We stopped at a nice stream to soak our feet.  I hope this will become a daily event.  The cold water feels so good a few miles into the hike -  almost like starting fresh.We've seen quite a lot of wildlife in the past two days.  Yesterday in late afternoon Arlene and I came upon two deer - yearlings, I think.  One, a male, had velvety antlers about a foot long.  Both were in full summer color.  They let us get within 20 feet and stood looking at us.  Then they turned and walked slowly up the trail ahead of us before darting off.  We also saw several rabbits, box turtles, a toad, some snails, and a tiger swallowtail butterfly (one of the few butterflies I can identify).  We passed through some interesting land today, but the physical effort of the hike left me with not much energy to write about it.  In one place we passed through a corridor of waist-high vegetation, mostly stinging nettle (see photo) with some cow parsnip hovering above.  Wild columbines were blooming here and there along the edge of the trail (see photo), and I saw some spiderwort that was pink rather than the usual purple color.  There was a light floral fragrance in this section.  Later I walked through an area that was a hillside piled high with moss-covered boulders (see photo).  Still later I passed through rhododendron thickets, then out onto a meadow where a strange golf ball-shaped FCC tower was placed.  Much of the hike today was uphill.  This combined with the mileage made me late finishing.  I got to the endpoint at 8:15 and was just able to get my tent set up before the rain started.  Tomorrow our WOW (without Warren) days start.

She gave him all of her candy bars.  Turtle remembered having given him Gatorade the last time they met. Some things I've forgotten to write about:* Everyone in the group except me has seen a bear on the trail.  Bill and Arlene are naming them like hurricanes.  So far there are Artemis, Barry, Chuck, Dougie, and Everett.  The next names up are Forrest, Gump, and Harold.  I'll get to name I, J, and K.  * The day Arlene and I passed through a pasture in the morning clouds Lizzie hiked south.  She arrived at that same pasture at the end of the day during a ferocious electrical storm.  Lightning struck on the other side of the pasture. She huddled, terrified, under a tree at the edge of the field and considered quitting the hike.  * Arlene was hiking beside some 6-foot high rocks in the sun one day when suddenly two large black snakes tumbled off a rock onto the trail in front of her. She theorizes that the snakes were having sex and got carried away.  * Two days ago I ate the first ripe blueberry and blackberry I've seen on the trail.* Today I heard the first cicadas on the trail.* Yesterday I smelled my first skunk on the trail.* Two days ago I taught Arlene how to identify poison ivy.  She used to say that all plants look alike.  Now she looks down and says, ""That's not poison ivy, that's not poison ivy, that's not poison ivy.""  * One day in May Lizzie took her clothes to an Asian laundry.  The owner approached her, ""Dirty hiker, you late.""  Lizzie responded, ""What time do you close?""  Owner: ""Dirty hiker come April.""  *One day climbing up a long hill I said to Lizzie, ""Sometimes this makes me feel like an old woman.  I know I am an old woman, but I don't usually feel like one."" Lizzie, who is 38, replied, ""Sometimes it makes me feel like an old woman, but I don't dare say that in this group.""  (Check ages of group members in the entry on the cast of characters.)When Turtle and I arrived at the trailhead parking lot where he was parked he took me to a nearby town and bought me a spaghetti dinner.  Then he dropped me back at the trailhead, and I hiked the remaining mile to where the van is parked tonight.  There is no suitable place to camp here, so Bill, Arlene, Rennie, and I are sleeping in the van.  Lizzie is off somewhere.  Patti is sleeping in her truck.  Once again we finished hiking without being rained on.  Tomorrow we hike 20.7 miles.  I'm hoping all the spaghetti, salad, and garlic bread I ate in town will make tomorrow's hike a little easier than the other 20-milers we've hiked this week.","BRP 76

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569157,"Today was such a mixture of things that it's hard to know where to start.  We started hiking at 6:00 AM so we could get an extra hour hiking in the coolest part of the morning.  We passed several interesting historical markers, saw some interesting plants, ate our first substantial amount of blackberries, and got rained on for about an hour. Beast of the day: copperhead snake (see photo).  I was walking along a narrow part of the trail when suddenly I heard a loud startled movement.  I turned and saw a snake newly coiled.  It wasn't moving or flicking its tongue, so I zoomed my phone camera to get its picture.  Lizzie, our snake lover, later identified it as a copperhead.  It was quite beautiful.  I'm glad I didn't know what it was at the time - it was scary enough just hearing its startled movement.Wildflower of the day: wild rose.  On our long ascent up Bluff Mountain we saw lots of wild roses, most of them humming with bee activity.  They're a favorite of mine from my childhood in Maine.  It was wonderful to see them growing in profusion.Ottie Cline Powell memorial: At the top of Bluff Mountain there was a monument to a four-year-old boy who died atop the mountain in November of 1880.  A teacher at his school sent several students out to hunt for wood for the stove.  Ottie wandered off and could not be found despite great community efforts.  His body was discovered in April of the following spring atop the mountain, seven miles from the school.  When I Googled his name lots of articles came up, causing me to conclude that he was pretty famous for a dead four-year-old.  Lizzie thought that should be the title of today's entry.Brown Creek Community: Near the end of today's hike we passed through an area that had been settled by emancipated slaves but abandoned around 1900.  The historical marker said to look for signs of the abandoned community for 1.4 miles, but I didn't see any signs that the place had ever been settled. The hill was so steep in this area that I could hardly imagine building there.  Culinary highlight of the day: Blackberries and blueberries!  On the way up Bluff Mountain we came upon lots of blackberry bushes with ripe berries (see photo).  Bill, Arlene, and I stopped to eat lots of them.  A little farther along I came upon a blueberry bush with a handful of ripe berries.  I ate them.  Our tents are set up in a grassy area between the parking lot and the road.  We figure we're not supposed to camp here, but there's no sign prohibiting it.  My tent was thoroughly mud-spattered and drenched from several days of rain.  I hope to get it dried out tonight.  My pack is starting to smell really bad from being set down on wet rocks, in mud, etc.  My hiking shoes are holding up pretty well after more than 900 miles, but they smell disgusting. While some of those miles were pre-hiked, this week we passed the 800 mile mark for the hike this spring. Tomorrow we have a short day - 8.5 miles.  We're going to leave at 6:00 again. I hope to finish before the rain starts in the afternoon and hitch a ride into town to get ice cream.  I'm going to try out my other low pair of hiking shoes since it's a short day.","VA 812, USFS 36

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569309,"Our hike today was short.  The 8.5 mile distance was chosen, I'm sure, to provide a rest after the four 20-mile days we've hiked in the last five days. Even though it was a short hike we still got up early and were on the trail by 6:15.  I didn't take my daypack but instead used a fanny pack that just had room for my snacks, hand sanitizer, and toilet paper.  For the first time in days I felt rested and energized in the morning, perhaps because I had real food last night.  (Lizzie had cooked some couscous with tuna and olives in it for dinner.  She offered it to me warning it was ""watery and terrible.""  I devoured it and found it good.). I tried out my Merrell shoes, which I haven't worn much before.  The first thing I noticed was that my toes felt like they had more room than in the Keens.  So I'm going to keep wearing them for a while.  The experiment with the small pack didn't work out so well.  When I got to the top of the highest mountain clouds blew in, and the wind picked up.  I would like to have stayed longer, but I had no extra layer of clothing to put on. So I had to keep moving to get down from the bald.  I finished at 11:30; Bill and Arlene arrived a bit later.  We had talked about going into town to get showers and a real meal.  Arlene had one bar of coverage on her cell phone and was able to reach a shuttle driver.  Piney arrived about 40 minutes later.  While we were waiting the sky clouded over and threatened rain.  We all pitched our tents so that we wouldn't be stuck doing it in the rain later.  (When we got back, the tents were still standing and not wet inside.) Our trip to town was more interesting than the hike today.  Piney has been shuttling hikers since the 1980s and has ""seen, heard, and done just about everything.""  He informed us that Wednesday was Hike Naked Day.  He says it was very popular in the 1990s but not so popular now.  He claims that Bill Bryson, author of A Walk in the Woods, was the stinkiest hiker he's ever shuttled.  He kept up a running narrative for the whole ride into town and the ride back.  He has a pronounced Virginia accent that sometimes made it very hard to know what he was saying.  He asked Arlene if she was ""maad"", which I took to mean mad.  But he was actually asking if she is married.  Piney took us to the city park in Buena Vista, and we showered for free.  It's been seven hot sweaty days since I've had a shower.  The feeling when I got out of the shower was unbelievably good.  (When I got back to where we're camped I hated to kneel down to get into my tent because I got my knees dirty again.)Next he dropped us at an Italian restaurant.  It turned out to be closed, so we walked to Lewis Grocery, which is reputed to have great burgers.  We ordered burgers and wandered around buying snacks while we waited for our food. Shortly before it was time to leave there was a downpour.  We still needed to go to Hardee's to get coffee for Rennie.  It was eight blocks away, and we had no rain gear.  We decided to wait 15 minutes for it to let up.  While we debated what to do Taren, the woman running the store, offered to drive us there as soon as her grandmother arrived to take over.  She told us she likes to help out hikers, and she certainly helped us.  Bill has lost so much weight that his shorts can pull completely down without being unzipped.  He asked whether the store had any twine he could have.  Taren went into the back and came out with enough twine for him to hold his pants up (see photo).  Wildlife sighting of the day: Bill saw a copperhead.Wildflower of the day: Canada lily.  I've only seen it once before today.  Tomorrow is what looks to be a relatively easy day - 17.0 miles and no rain predicted.","Long Mountain Wayside, US 60

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569440,"Earlier in the hike, probably during the days of rain, cold, or hail, one of my sister Diane's friends asked her, ""Is Charli stupid or crazy?""   I've been thinking about that.  I'm crazy but not crazier than the other people in the Expedition.  I think a person has to be a bit crazy to complete this hike.   We're now in Virginia in the green tunnel.  Virginia has 558 miles of the Appalachian Trail.  The trail goes up and down mountains and along ridges, mostly through woods that obscure the views of what lies below.  It feels like we're working hard all day with no payoff.  This is a part of the trail where a lot of people quit.  Today I thought a lot about why our little group has not quit, and I think it has something to do with an irrational obsession, a sort of craziness.When I started the hike I told myself that I'd quit if the hike was doing permanent damage to my body.  The day I fell and broke my wrist I was in despair realizing  - for the first time - that I might not be able to finish.  I discovered that day that I no longer was willing to quit even if the hike were going to do me permanent damage.  I'm 900 miles in, and I can't quit.  Crazy.Arlene first became interested in hiking the AT when she saw a National Geographic program about it.  When she attended the Appalachian Trail Institute, the one-week class that Warren teaches, she was happy to find that that the other people there were just as crazy as she was: they all wanted to hike the whole trail.  She traveled from California five times, taking time off from work, to attend the prep hikes.  She has had plantar fasciitis since the beginning of the hike.  Her feet hurt almost every day.  Earlier this week, while we were hiking she told me, ""I'm really happy to be here, even though I hurt a lot and cry every day.""  Crazy.   Lizzie was closest to quitting when she was hunkered down under a tree during a ferocious thunderstorm.  Lightning hit the other side of the pasture she had to cross.  She huddled there crying and thinking about quitting.  Then she thought, I've just had my very worst day on the AT.  And she decided to stay. Crazy.I asked Bill whether he thought he was crazy to do the hike.  He said yes and no.  Yes because it's dangerous.  During one prep hike he was up on a bald mountaintop during a severe storm.  It was cold and wet;  the wind was so high it was blowing him sideways about eight feet with each gust; fog was coming so that he couldn't see the white blazes on the posts that were the only sign of the trail; he didn't know which road he was supposed to be picked up at.  For several minutes he feared he might die there exposed to the wind and cold on the mountain.  Eventually he saw headlights and realized he was at the pickup point.  The crazy part is that he continued after this experience and is still hiking.  The not crazy part is that he's fulfilling a goal that many people have and do not get to pursue.  He's pursuing his dream, which is absolutely not crazy.  Where I soaked my feet today: Cripple CreekNumber of times in the past 832 miles that I've stopped to get a rock out of my shoe: 3Happy West Virginia Day to all my fellow mountaineers!","Salt Log Gap, USFS 63

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569505,"Today was Hike Naked day, but it was a bust.   I only saw one person who approached being naked, a young man with a black and white shawl tied around his waist like a loincloth.  Later in the day he took off the shawl and hiked in his underpants.  Lizzie's theory is that hiking naked was much more popular before the cellphone era.  She's probably right.  The trail today was very rocky, hard to cross without the use of my broken left arm.  When crossing boulders it's helpful to use one hand to balance.  I had to go very slowly.  The climbs today were worth the effort though.  There were several rock outcroppings with wonderful views of the mountains we crossed yesterday and the farmland below.  Tomorrow is a town day.  First we hike 14.3 miles to Rockfish Gap.  Then we drive to Waynesboro.  Lizzie goes to the post office to pick up mail.  We check into a hotel and shower.  Then we do laundry and go to dinner.  It makes me tired just thinking about it.  But the good news is that I have Friday and most of Saturday off.  Last September my friends Susan and Bill hiked the first 39 miles of the AT inside Shenandoah National Park with me.  Since it is within the 12-month period for my thru hike I'm not going to redo them.  I'll skip the 22.3 mile day on Friday and all but 3.5 miles of the 21.9 mile hike on Saturday.  I hope to use my free time on Friday to find an orthopedist to check my wrist and take the cast off during the week of July 4.  I had hoped to write today about how we know where to go and how we know where we are, but I'm very tired and have a headache.  So I'm headed for my tent. Trail trivia: Often at rock outcroppings at high places I see several hikers texting or talking on their phones.  They're taking advantage of the cell service wherever they get it.  Several days ago one asked me whether I wanted to join them at the Internet cafe.   I couldn't because I had no service.","Tye River, VA 56

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569652,"Today we were headed to Waynesboro, VA to do our errands.  About every 10 days we go into a town.  This is our opportunity to stay overnight in indoor lodgings, get a shower, do laundry, and get groceries.  Most hikers take a day off to do this so they can get their errands done and rest.  Our schedule does not permit this.  We typically hike a substantial, but shorter than usual, number of miles and then cram in all the errands.   We started hiking at our new usual time: 6:00 AM.  Arlene, Bill, and I arrived at the van at 2:00 - just as Lizzie and Patti (the Southbound hikers) arrived in their vehicles.  From then on there was a whirlwind of activity that didn't let up till 11:30 PM.  First we went to the post office to pick up mail.  Then we found a place to eat and ate as much as we could get down.  While Arlene, Lizzie, Patti, and I ate Rennie went to the local outfitter to pick up a spare pair of hiking boots he had ordered.  When Rennie and Bill got back we all went to a little hotel for which we had coupons.  The rooms to which the coupons applied were all taken.  The owner, a nice East Indian man, was willing to make us a deal on two other rooms, but the place was a bit run down.  We decided to try Comfort Inn, for which we also had coupons.  There was only one room left there.  Rather than waste more time looking we took that room.  It was a standard size hotel room with one king size bed, a regular bathroom, and a separate room with a 3-person Jacuzzi.  The six of us started taking showers and doing laundry.  Because it had been ten days since the last town stop each one of us had a full load.  There was only one washer and one dryer.  It took us till 8 o'clock to get the laundry done. Arlene, Bill, Rennie, and I then drove to Walmart to get groceries.  By the time we finished shopping it was after 9 o'clock.  Then Rennie needed to eat (he had skipped the earlier meal).  We drove around looking for someplace that was open and finally found a Wendy's.  While Rennie and Bill ate inside, Arlene and I stayed in the van to unpack our groceries and fit them into our food bins.  Back at the hotel we gathered our clean clothes and packed them into our clothing bins in the van.  Then we settled into the room for the night.  Arlene and I got the bed; Bill, Patti, and Rennie slept on their sleeping mats with their sleeping bags on the floor; Lizzie slept on an improvised couch.  We finally turned out the lights a bit after 11:30.  What a long day!  Bill earlier joked that in town we rush around doing errands and have 17 minutes to relax at the end of the day.  Today we didn't even get the 17 minutes.  We all look forward to town days because we get showers, a treat of such great magnitude that only a hiker can fully comprehend.  But we also dread it because of the superhuman effort it takes to get everything done.  And it all has to be done.  If you skip laundry you spend many extra days wearing really stinky clothes.  If you don't buy the right groceries, you're left eating whatever food was so horrible you couldn't bring yourself to eat it before.  Only now it's ten days older and staler than it was.  Group news: Rennie has lost so much weight that he's worried about his health.  This afternoon he had us take a picture of him shirtless that he sent to his wife.  I have no idea what or how much he eats.  I've never seen him eat anything on the trail other than an apple.  He gets into camp so early each night that he's already finished eating when the rest of us arrive.  He typically eats just about everything that goes into the communal food box in addition to his own food.  He needs a whole lot more calories than the rest of us because he hikes so much faster and never takes a break.  I think he's also unhappy because he spends so much time waiting around for us doing nothing.  We don't dawdle, but we do stop at the places with good views and take pictures of flowers, snakes, etc.  And Bill, Arlene, and I usually stop to soak our feet in the cold water of a stream midday.  Rennie typically doesn't stop at all.  It must be a great frustration to him to spend so much time waiting around.  He's now talking about quitting because of us and says he's serious.  We all would hate to see him leave and are trying to encourage him to eat more.  He's also now considering taking off the six days in Pennsylvania that we've already hiked to rest up and eat.Other group news: Terri, who went home several weeks ago with knee injuries, texted Bill yesterday that she's coming back ""soon"", although she hasn't given us a date.  Scott, who went home with heart problems on the third day of the hike, has had his medical procedure.  He sees his doctor next week on the 26th.  Assuming all is well, his wife will drive him here on the 27th. Then he'll start hiking with us on the 28th, probably at a reduced speed and mileage.  Wildflower of the Day: wild raspberry (see photo)!  There were both blooms (very pretty) and berries.  I haven't seen any of these in years, so it was a real treat.Bird of the day: nuthatch, one of the few I've heard this whole hike.Beast of the day: cinnamon-colored toad about one inch long.  I saw hundreds of these in Maine last summer and have seen quite a few on this trip as well. Very small and cute.  When I get a good photo I'll post it and ask for help to identify it.  Beast of the week: Lizzie saw a water snake and got a good picture of it (see photo).  Historical ruins of the day: Toward the end of the hike we passed through a wooded place that was settled at one time.  There was a long stone wall similar to the stone fences in New England and a clearing with lots of gray flat stones in the ground.  On closer inspection we saw they were natural rocks meant to mark graves.  Most of them had no names or dates on them and were not shaped or embellished in any way.  Finally we came to a stone chimney and the remains of surrounding stone walls.  The place must have been abandoned for a long time: there was a fully mature tulip poplar growing right up against it. It amazes me that people actually lived in such inhospitable places.  The land is so steep and rocky that it's hard to walk over.  What hard lives these pioneers must have had!Send some good thoughts Rennie's way please.","Dripping Rock, BRP 9.6

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569722,"Today the group hiked the first 22.3 miles of the trail in Shenandoah National Park.  I didn't hike.  I had hiked these miles late last September with my friends Susan and Bill Hosaflook (see journal entries from September 19 to 22) as preparation for this hike.  I didn't count the miles then because I planned to rehike them.  Now, however, I realize I need all the rest I can get.  So I've gone back to those entries to add the miles and am taking today as a rest day.  While the group was hiking I stayed in town.  I succeeded in setting up an appointment with an orthopedist in Winchester, Virginia to get my cast removed on July 6.  From July 2 through 7 the schedule is to hike from Turners Gap, MD to Clarks Valley, PA (123.8 miles).  All of us have hiked this section during our group prep hikes.  Everyone except Rennie is planning to take this time off, either to rest or to hike some miles ahead.  Hiking ahead builds in rest days for later.  I'd rather have rest days spaced out rather than have six in a row.  My sister Diane is going to drive here from Wisconsin to help get me to the doctor's appointment and to shuttle me where I need to go to hike ahead.  Scott will be back from Iowa and wants to hike.  Arlene may also be interested.  We plan to pick some longer hikes, say 19 or 20 miles, and hike them in two days rather than one.  I spent some time trying to coordinate all of this.  Then I ate a leisurely, highly calorific lunch.  Now I'm at the outfitters waiting to be picked up by Patti, one of our southbound hikers.  One thing I like about hiking the AT: being on top of a mountain early in the morning.  The feeling of being in the woods early in the morning is indescribable - the freshness, the quiet, the beginnings of birdsong.  Looking out over mountains makes me thankful to be alive.One thing I dislike about hiking the AT: being filthy.  Within a half day of showering there is dark grime under all fingernails.  We touch trees and rocks to balance and pull ourselves up.  We kneel in wet places to take photos, then brush the dirt off our knees.  We crawl into our tents on hands and knees.  We set up and take down dirty wet tents.  We clean our hands with hand sanitizer. This kills germs but just moves the actual dirt around from place to place on our hands.  After one day our hands feel sticky.  We take bird baths in our tents at night using baby wipes.  This deposits more chemicals on our skin.  Now that the warm weather has finally arrived, we try to bathe in streams if there's enough time.  Even so, we feel constantly smelly and grubby.  We wear our clothing for many days between town stops or showers.  The shirts made of synthetic fibers smell of body odor after one day, really bad body odor after two days.  The third day the microbes have multiplied exponentially and create a massive stench.  We hate to put our clothes on in the morning because they smell so bad.  I have two lightweight wool shirts that are much less stinky than the synthetic ones.  I am lucky.Wildflower of the day: the pretty weed I found along the road while walking to the outfitters.  Can anyone identify it?","Rockfish Gap, US250 & BRP

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569848,"Yesterday I got a taste of what it must be like to be homeless.  I stayed in the hotel until six minutes before checkout time to get as much online research and phone calling done as possible.  I had left most of my belongings in the van, so what I had for the day was a double-bagged Walmart bag to carry my cherries and banana, my Bluetooth keyboard, my rain jacket, my book.  The hotel folks told me there was a bus that went downtown from Walmart.  I walked less than half a mile to Walmart.  I realized I'd put my toothbrush in the van, so I bought a toothbrush and toothpaste and went into the restroom to brush my teeth.  I felt very strange brushing my teeth in a public restroom.  Then I realized my double Walmart bag probably wouldn't hold the weight of what was inside, so I bought a sturdier reusable plastic grocery bag.  I waited about 45 minutes at the bus stop.  The bus was late, there was a major accident, and it took me two hours to get the two or three miles downtown.  Once there I found a restaurant and got lunch, then walked to the outfitter store about a mile away.  There I bought a few things and spent more time waiting around for my ride back to the trail.  It was a disorienting experience having no place to stay and no easy way to get from one place to another.  Today dawned cool and sunny.  I had previously hiked all but the last 4.9 miles of today's hike.  I rode north in the van, got out at Powell Gap, and hiked the 4.9 miles to today's end point.  I was finished by 9:15 in the morning.  A whole day off!  I didn't attempt anything ambitious but instead had a nap.  I was awakened by the telephone ringing (an unusual event because I nearly always have it set on airplane mode).  It was Scott calling to let me know that he has had more atrial fibrillation issues.  He still thinks he can come back, but he may be very slow on the uphills.  He's been walking ten to twelve miles a day, but they are ""Iowa miles"", that is, flat.  He sees the doctor on Monday and will text us to let us know how it goes.  In the afternoon I got out the schedule and AWOL (more on that later) to pick some days on the upcoming schedule that we could readily divide into two-day hikes.  I found two days that had road crossings near the midpoint - an 18.6 mile hike scheduled for July 13 and a 19.6 mile hike scheduled for July 17. Doing these in advance would give us two rest days spaced four days apart. We would have Diane drop us at the starting point, pick us up at the midway point, and take us back to wherever we're staying on one day, then resume the hike at the midway point the next day.  This would allow us to avoid two longer hikes and replace them with two rest days.  Rennie has decided he won't rehike the 123-mile section of Maryland and Pennsylvania that we've already done as prep hikes.  Instead, he'll take a break along with the rest of us.  He says he and Bill will drive the van to the endpoint indicated on the schedule each day, stopping to look at anything interesting and eating as heartily as possible.  How We Know Where to Go: We hikers have lots of resources to help us navigate the trail.  The basics are (1) the trail markings and signage, (2) the ATC Data Book, (3) The AT Guide 2017 Northbound (AWOL), and (4) the Guthook app.  Trail markings and signage: The trail is marked with 2-inch by 6-inch white blazes that are painted on trees, rocks, signposts, telephone poles, pavement, or wherever else is needed to indicate the route.  Double white blazes indicate a change, usually a turn.  The trail also has signs indicating mileage to shelters, road crossings, mountain tops, gaps, or other places of interest.  Typically they are found where trails intersect, in gaps, and at road crossings.  Blue blazes indicate a side trail, such as a trail to a shelter or a scenic overlook.  Most hikers have a rule of thumb about how far they will hike without seeing a white blaze, as absence of blazes may mean that you've gotten off the trail.  Hikers figure out where they are by estimating their pace and how much time has elapsed since they passed the sign.  The ATC Data Book: This book lists landmarks, mountaintops, and the like with mileage markers.  It lists the elevation of each entry and indicates which locations have water sources, groceries, restaurants, bathrooms, and the like. I haven't used it enough to say more.AWOL: This little book is worth its weight in gold.  It lists all sorts of features of the trail - streams, springs, mountaintops, gaps, trail intersections, places with good views, road crossings, parking lots, campsites, and shelters.  Each entry has a mile marker and elevation, and there is a profile of the elevation that runs vertically down the page so you can see how steep and how long each ascent and descent is. On the back of the trail pages there is information about the towns that the trail passes through - maps, hostel and hotel information, restaurant and grocery store information, shuttle info, etc. I use this to plan where to get water and sometimes just to keep me focused on a goal and moving from one to the next.   How We Know Where We Are: Guthook app: This is a wonderful resource.  My late husband would have loved this.  This app has maps of the AT, an elevation view showing water sources, road crossings, shelters, landmarks, etc. Click GPS and it puts a blue bubble at your location.  Click on the blue bubble to get your exact GPS coordinates and your mile marker on the trail.  Click on a landmark, and it tells you how far you have to go to reach it or how far you've gone past it.  This feature is wonderful when you get to the end of the day and just really want to know how many miles are left and where exactly you are. From this you can figure your ETA based on your pace.  We have three long days coming up: 19.9 miles tomorrow, 19.4 miles the next day, and 18.7 miles the following day.  I'm ready to get back to hiking.","Skyline Drive mile 84.3

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570007,"Today we had a long hike, but there was a prize at the end: dinner and beer at Big Meadows Wayside.  We just had to get there before it closed.  We weren't sure when that was.  So we got on the trail by 5:45 AM.  I started with Arlene and Bill and stayed with them for the first four miles or so.  They took a break at a shelter, and I went on ahead.  The day was sunny and breezy.  It never got warm, so I had to put on my windbreaker every time I stopped hiking.We are in Shenandoah National Park.  The main road through the park is Skyline Drive, which runs along the top of the mountain ridges and has many scenic view pulloffs for cars.  It's also popular with bicyclists and motorcycle riders: the road is hilly and curvy, and no big trucks are allowed on it.  The AT generally parallels the road not far away, so even though we were in the woods we could hear cars and motorcycles for much of the day.  It made for a strange hike.About nine miles in I reached Lewis Mountain Campground.  Guthook said there was a store there with food, so I got off the trail to check it out.  The store turned out to be just .1 mile from the trail.  I was dazzled by the opportunity to eat real food.  I bought a ham and cheese sandwich, an ice cream bar, and a large bottle of ginger ale.  The store manager threw in free coffee.  I was in hog heaven.  The only thing better would be if there had been milk.  I sat outside on the bench and ate.  I couldn't finish the ginger ale so I didn't get the full 800 calories I was hoping for, but I was too chilled to drink anything cold.  Just as I was leaving Bill and Arlene arrived.  We decided to try to reach Big Meadows Wayside or Lodge for dinner.  The manager at the campground store told us it was open till 8:00 so we figured we could make it in time.  We agreed that I'd wait for them to catch up when I reached Hazeltop, a high point where I expected to get cell service.  I could check email while I waited.  I didn't have to wait long.  While I was reading texts and checking email another hiker arrived and sat on a rock next to me.  The last time I came upon a group of people using their phones at a high rock outcropping they invited me into their Internet cafe.  So I invited her into mine.  Then Arlene and Bill arrived. They decided to avoid further breaks so as to finish the hike early.  Our goal was to arrive by 5:30.  We arrived about 5:00, which put our pace around 1.75 miles an hour.  We were pleased to finish a 19.9-mile hike in less than 12 hours.  When we got to the endpoint everyone except Rennie piled into Patti's truck to get dinner at Big Meadows Wayside.  The menu there had calories for everything on it. I ordered a fried chicken dinner with mashed potatoes, gravy, coleslaw, and a biscuit - about 975 calories.  To that I added a beer (150 calories) and blackberry cobbler with blackberry ice cream (650 calories).  I was able to eat every bit of this without feeling too stuffed.  We left there feeling happy and satisfied.  We're now settled in for the night.  Yesterday I retired my wool long underwear top and bottom that I've been wearing as pajamas to my clothing bin, thinking I wouldn't need them for a while.  Today I took them back out and am now wearing them.  Tomorrow our hike is 19.4 miles, and there will again be a chance to eat real food.  This makes me very happy.Best excuse of the day: Bill, ""I'm going really slow this morning because I just put on clean clothes, and I don't want to get them sweaty.""  (The sad part of this is that it's probably true.  Once we get clean clothes or take a shower we try really hard to preserve that clean state.)Wildlife sighting of the day: Arlene and I came upon a doe that was eating vegetation about three feet off the trail.  When we got to within 12 feet I started talking to the deer, warning her not to let humans get near her.  She looked up and continued munching.  We were so close I could see the flies on her back. When we got to within about five feet she turned and walked about five feet back into the woods.   Then she turned around again, looked at us, and continued eating.  Completely unafraid.  Wondering why we were on her turf. She didn't turn to leave until I stopped taking pictures and bent forward to pick up my walking stick.  Skyline 66.7: At Lewis Mountain Campground there was a large poster at the main kiosk with the history of the camp.  It was built at a time when racial segregation was still mandatory in Virginia.  Harold Ickes, who was Secretary of the Interior at the time, was a civil rights proponent.  He pressured the National Park Service to create a campground exclusively for the use of African-Americans.  Later he pushed for integration.  Interestingly, some easing was already started.  The cook at Lewis Mountain was so good that white folks started asking to eat there.  Very interesting place.","Skyline 66.7

The disease is in some parts of the park but not others.  They're trying to prevent the spread of this disease.  About six miles into the hike we came to Skyland Resort and Restaurant, just a tenth of a mile off the trail.  Arlene and I went in for breakfast, and Bill caught up with us in the dining room.  I ate an enormous breakfast - malted waffle with blackberry syrup (1129 calories!), an order of bacon, a 16-ounce glass of milk, and coffee.  I'm trying very hard not to lose any more weight, so I take every opportunity to eat real food.  I left the restaurant so full I almost felt sick.  I dislike overeating, but that food held me over for nearly four hours before I got hungry again.  I also bought a large ham and cheese sandwich to eat later.  I hiked with Arlene.  Although we didn't dawdle we stopped at each overlook. At the last one, Mary's Rock, we stopped and ate our sandwiches.  The view here was spectacular. We watched hawks soaring and catching thermals below us.  We left there at 5 o'clock with five more miles to hike.  At Thornton Gap we got off the trail to make a bathroom stop at a rest area.  Lizzie was driving by, saw us, and stopped to say high.  She put our packs in her trunk, so we hiked the last miles without our daypacks.  We arrived at the endpoint shortly after 7:00.Berry report:  We saw lots of wild raspberries in bloom, lots of blueberries not yet ripe.  We ate some wild blackberries which are just becoming ripe.","Fishers Gap, Skyline 49.3

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607888,"Today was another lovely day to hike - cool, sunny, breezy, with a bright blue sky and low humidity.  We were again hiking along a ridge with occasional rock outcroppings (see photo) and spectacular views.  I always take a lot of pictures from the top of the mountain, but I rarely use them for my journal: no photograph could convey the actual beauty of the real life view.  Yesterday the park ranger named all the valleys and the four mountain ranges we could see.  The farthest range in the distance was in West Virginia.  Today there was a place where we saw several more mountains in front of them.  We have seen so many beautiful places that we sometimes are blasé about what we're walking through.  This morning Arlene and I were walking through a section of woods that was blanketed with ferns as far as we could see, with trees interspersed among them.  The morning light was backlighting the bright green of the ferns.  It was truly lovely.  But we were just cruising along forgetting to pay attention to where we were.  Had I seen it this place before the hike I would have told all my friends what a spectacular place I had seen.  Today I was just making time.  Arlene stopped to take a picture, but I didn't.  I had already photographed a similar place.  About five miles into today's hike we reached a store that had a grill.  We got there at 8:30 and had to wait till 9:00 for it to open.  We waited though because the prospect of real food was irresistible.  My sister/editor Diane says that my early journal entries were all about how cold I was and all my current entries are about how hungry I am.  I think that's the way of a hiker's life.  By this time in the hike, 965 miles in, we have all lost weight and are continually hungry.  Bill, Arlene, and I can all pull our shorts and pants down without unzipping them.  (See the picture several days ago of Bill holding his pants up with twine.)We had some bad news today.  Our member Scott, who went home to Iowa because of atrial fibrillation, will not be rejoining the group.  (We had been expecting him to arrive tomorrow.). He has had more incidences of fibrillation since the medical procedure.  Although the doctor said he could come, it's now too late for him to complete a thru hike.  And he has family considerations as well.  We're all disappointed that he won't be back, but we completely understand why he would make such a choice.  Tomorrow is a town day.  We'll pick up mail and packages in Linden, VA and will get groceries and do our laundry in Front Royal.  What we hear in the woods: - our feet hitting the trail,- our hiking sticks hitting the dirt, rocks, or roots of the trail,- the songs and calls of songbirds,- the loud crack a tree makes before it falls, - the crash a tree makes when it hits the ground,- airplanes (including low-flying military aircraft),- trains (occasionally), - cars and trucks (often), - motorcycles (lots of them in Shenandoah National Park),- the crashing of bears in the underbrush, - the chattering of squirrels and chipmunks, - the song of the whippoorwill at night,- the hooting of owls (mostly barred owls), -the sound of other hikers talking, and- utter silence.One thing I like about hiking the AT: it has cured my caffeine addiction.  The second day of the hike I had a caffeine withdrawal headache, but after that I was free.  One think I dislike about hiking on the AT: No coffee!  I love the taste, smell, and everything else about coffee.  I especially like the little lift in mind and body that a cup of hot coffee gives me in the morning.  Bill says my trail name should be Caffeine.  *Editor's note: At times the photo of the day will appear rotated on mobile devices but not computers.  This is a Trail Journals issue and cannot be helped...yet.","Beahms Gap, Skyline 28.5

Ordinarily we'd get up earlier than usual and be on the trail at 5:30 instead of 6:00 for such a long day.   But staying somewhere other than the starting point of the hike means shuttling both the northbound (Arlene, Bill, and me) and the southbound hikers (Lizzie, Rennie, and Patti).  This would mean a later start than usual on a really long day.  And this is the day before we all go on a six-day break.The hike today was not as spectacular as the previous two days, but it was sunny and pleasant.  I saw a pretty yellow wildflower that I don't know.  We met some Jehovah's Witnesses at a road crossing who were proseletyzing and giving out cold water and granola bars.  We saw a lovely shelter, the Jim and Molly Denton shelter, that had day lilies, a solar shower, and a separate picnic shelter.  And we ended at a spot where road repair was going on, and one of the workers had been a thru hiker years earlier.  This hiking life is so full of interesting people and things.  I feel really fortunate to be hiking the trail and seeing, smelling, tasting, and hearing this path.","Compton Gap, Skyline 10.4

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570398,"Today is our two-month anniversary of being on the trail.  We're at mile 997.1, so we'll cross the 1,000 mile mark early tomorrow.  It's hard to believe that we're this far along already.  In some ways it seems like we just started; in others it seems we've been doing this forever.  I feel strong and happy.  I know this isn't real life, but I'm enjoying it while I can.  The hike today was through woods and fields and over piles of rocks.  In the morning the trail was in woods much like we've been hiking in for several weeks.  There we met Kirsten, a trail maintainer from the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club.  She was trimming both sides of the trail with a string trimmer.  She's one of hundreds of volunteers from various hiking clubs who maintain the trail. Each section of the trail is maintained by a specific club.  Kristen is responsible for a one-mile section that includes the AT and part of an intersecting trail. Since I was with Bill, the ultimate people person, we talked to her for quite a while.  She times her trimming so that the trilliums that grow in her section have had most of their growth for the year before she cuts.   We passed through Sky Meadows State Park (see photos).  Some of the meadows were open with trees at either side.  Another meadow had trees interspersed, which provided shade on a hot day.  Another section was being overtaken by various shrubs and bushes and lots of wild grapevines.  I find all of these places very appealing.  
We've been seeing some huge trees recently, and I stopped to take pictures of some.  At one place I heard the cracking sound of a tree about to lose a limb or fall.  I ran past it and yelled back to Arlene to warn her.  Bill passed the tree later and said it was moving.  We met a hiker who had hiked the Camino de Santiago in Spain last year and was out preparing for another such hike.  We saw a small black snake, a ring-necked snake, I think.  The end of the hike was the first several miles of a place called the Roller Coaster.  This is a 13.5-mile section of PUDs (pointless ups and downs).  Lizzie opined that it had to be given an imaginative name because the trail there is so boring.  This part of the trail has some relatively steep sections with rocks to negotiate at the top of each one.  I got off the trail at one such rocky place but quickly got back on.  It would not be a place to hike at night.  I arrived at the endpoint shortly after 6:00.  There our trail angel, Nancy Lake, had set up to provide us some wonderful snacks.  She brought hummus, guacamole, chips, crackers, deviled eggs, cheddar cheese, salsa, carrots, cookies, and a cooler of cold drinks.  Lizzie, Bill, Arlene, and I sat around a table eating and hearing stories about previous Expeditions. Nancy was a member of the 1995 Expedition and has been providing trail magic for other Expeditions ever since.  We laughed a lot and ate a lot.  I'm now settled into my little tent for the first time in many days.  Lizzie is going to hike northbound with us tomorrow so we can cross the thousand mile mark together.  I'm looking forward to it.","VA 725/VA 55

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570528,"Last night I slept in my tent with both vestibules open.  It allowed some air movement, but it also gave me a view to lots of fireflies.  One got into the space between the mesh layer and outer layer of the tent, which was lovely.  We've crossed the 1,000 mile mark and are poised to leave Virginia for good.  We set out at 6:00 AM to hike the Roller Coaster.  The hills looked neither steep nor long on the profile in AWOL, but they were harder than they looked.  There was a lot of rock hopping.  When we arrived at the 1,000 mile mark, we realized we were only going one mile an hour.  There were ten miles of this. At noon we still had more than ten miles to go.  This was also the first really hot day of the summer.  It was about 85 degrees and humid.I would like to have stopped at Bears Den Hostel for coffee or ice cream.  Lizzie called to find out the hours of the store.  It was only open till 9 AM, so we skipped it.  Later Skittles and another hiker passed.  They had stopped at the hostel and gotten ice cream.   Once we were past the Roller Coaster the terrain changed.  There were fewer rocks and smaller hills.  In mid-afternoon Lizzie caught up with me.  She had been ahead but had stopped at a spring on a side trail to get water and wash herself.  I hiked with her the rest of the way.  What fun!  I've missed hiking with her.  She wonders about so many things.  Do all pit vipers reproduce by live birth?  Did the striations around many of the rocks we saw come into existence at the time of the rest of the rock or at a later period?  She says Terry Gross's podcasts of ""Fresh Air"" are going to get her to Katahdin.  We crossed the state line into West Virginia, but we haven't left Virginia for good yet.  The trail meanders back and forth between the two states for a while.  When we got to West Virginia there was a refreshing breeze.  We used this to push ourselves into a faster gear.  We finished a few minutes before 7:00.  It took us 13 hours to hike 20.4 miles.  Very slow.  When we got back to the trailhead parking lot Nancy Lake was again waiting for us.  She had rented High Acres for us to spend the evening and overnight.  This is a Victorian House that has a beautiful view overlooking the Potomac River.  Two of Arlene's friends, Marie and Lucy, met us there.  We had a nice dinner and talked and laughed until way too late.  It's now 11:30, and I'm just about to get to bed.  I'm utterly exhausted.  Tomorrow we get up at 4:30 so we can be back at the trailhead by 5:30.  It's another long hike, 23.7 miles.  But at the end of the day my sister Diane will arrive to pick me up for a six-day break from the trail.  These days are the sections that the group hiked in practice hikes, and none of us is rehiking this section.  We're all taking a break to eat, sleep, and rest.","Morgans Mill Rd., VA 605

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570725,"Our stay at High Acres was so enjoyable (see photo)!  The house is old and has no air conditioning.  So we slept with all windows open.  A lovely breeze blew in and kept us cool.  When Arlene got up in the middle of the night moonlight was shining on the Potomac outside our windows.  Even though staying at High Acres caused us to have a very short night of sleep, it was worth doing. Our high mileage schedule causes us to rush through places and miss things we'd like to stop and see.  So getting to spend some time off the trail in a nice place with like-minded people made us feel like we got to have some fun.  (Make no mistake, hiking 15.7 miles a day is way more like work than like fun.  Rewarding work, but nonetheless work.) We got up at  4:30 and were back at the trailhead at 5:30.  Nancy stopped at a convenience store on the way so we could get coffee.  By the time we'd eaten breakfast (two donuts and a pint of whole milk for me) it was 6:00.  Our plan was to hike fast enough to get to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Center when it opened at 9:00.  The distance is 6.3 miles.  High Acres is connected to the trail by a rock staircase and a short walk through a cemetery.  Nancy offered to drive us to the ATC Center to save us some walking time (the regular side trail is longer).  We hiked fast - more than two miles an hour - and got to the Center just after it opened.  The ATC Center is the psychological halfway point of the trail.  Hikers register there, have their photos taken and entered in a yearbook, and are assigned a number.  (I was the 1309th northbound hiker to register this year.)  Arlene, Bill, and I had postcards made from our pictures and then had the ATC photographer take a group picture of us.  Arlene was so happy to have made it this far that she got teary-eyed.  Lizzie sat outside on the steps and declined to register or be photographed.  We later learned that she was having heat problems and was trying to keep from vomiting or passing out.  Nancy took us back to High Acres, and we all had cold soft drinks and leftover pizza before we continued hiking.  The trail took us right through downtown Harpers Ferry, past the site of John Brown's raid (see photo), across a pedestrian bridge beside the railroad bridge, and onto the C & O canal towpath along the Potomac River.  I had never been to Harpers Ferry before and didn't realize that basically the whole town is a national historic park.  (Failure to sightsee here is an embarrassment: I've lived in West Virginia for 37 years now.). The trail along the canal was nice - flat, easy walking, and pretty.  There were nice views of the Potomac along the way.  At lunchtime Arlene and I went down a path to the river and ate lunch sitting on a log under a mulberry tree (see photo).  We picked mulberries and ate them for dessert. Afterwards Arlene said, ""Today I ate lunch beside the Potomac River sitting under a mulberry tree.""  We speculated that this might be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  We're trying to appreciate the wonderful parts of this journey and hold on to them.After lunch we reached a part of the trail where there is still water in the canal.  It was algae-filled and looked like a solid hard green surface.  When we looked closer we saw lots of big turtles sunning themselves on logs (see photo).  Some looked to be 10 or 12 inches long.  After the trail turned uphill and left the woods we saw lots of trumpet vine in bloom.  We're starting to see the full summer wildflowers; the spring ones are nearly all gone.There was a long rocky uphill and, after that, a long walk along a ridge.  The temperature and humidity were high.  Sweat rolled down my face and dripped off my arms.  I constantly wiped my face with my bandanna.  I caught up with Lizzie; she was hoping for rain.  She got her wish.  A rain shower started slowly and built to a downpour.  I got out my plastic bag and rubber bands to cover my cast, which is not waterproof, but didn't put on any more rain gear.  It felt good walking through the rain.  I like drinking the rain that rolls down my face.  Once the rain stopped our clothes gradually dried.  Arlene sent us a text that there was a hiker feed at Gathland State Park.  When we got there a group of hikers, one of them Nancy, were set up serving hot dogs, chicken, various salads, cantaloupe, watermelon, soft drinks, brownies, cake, cookies, etc.  We stopped and ate.  Nancy was there and told us she was considering hiking with our group for a while later in the summer.  We've met so many nice people during this hike, and it's fun having some of them hike with us for a while.  It was late afternoon when we got back on the trail.  Bill, Arlene, Lizzie, and I all started out together.  We had 7.5 miles left to go, and it was nearly 5:00.  The rest of the hike felt very long. My sister Diane texted that she had arrived at the endpoint at 5:00.  I told her to go eat, that we wouldn't be in until 7:30 or 8:00.   The ridge was quite rocky for the rest of the way, and we had to pick our way very carefully.   Lizzie and I hiked together and got in at 8:00.  Bill and Arlene were about 10 minutes behind us.  It took us a while to get ourselves organized, but we finally got loaded into the car.  Bill was meeting a friend in downtown Boonsboro (MD), so we dropped him there.  Arlene was going to Philadelphia by Amtrak for the break.  We brought her back to the hotel in Shepherdstown (WV) with us.  It was a really long but satisfying day.  We're now more than halfway done.  We've completed six states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland.  When we resume hiking on July 9 we'll start at mile 1164.9 - with only 1024.9 miles to go.","Keys Gap, WV 9

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570874,"Diane and I have been doing errands since she arrived.  It's been a lot of driving after her 17-hour drive from Wisconsin.  Sunday in Shepherdstown (WV) I got a spa pedicure.  This was the ultimate in foot care - cleaning, trimming nails, exfoliating dead skin, massaging feet and calves, lotion, hot towels, etc.  When I left I felt like I had a pair of new feet!  Since then we've accomplished the following:
 - Bought Crocs (in Martinsburg, WV) to use as camp shoes (my sneakers had gotten very stinky from all the days of being continuously wet); - Exchanged an AT t-shirt for the correct size (in Harpers Ferry, WV); and - Bought new bigger hiking shoes (in Reading, PA).  Today I hiked the 11.5 miles that is scheduled for next Wednesday.  It was rocky for much of the way.  I stopped at the top of the first uphill at Dan's Pulpit, a rock outcropping with a view of Pennsylvania farmland below.  A hiker named Chili Dog  was there talking on his phone.  I chatted a bit with him, and we hiked together for a while.  The next viewpoint, Balance Rocks, required a climb up a pile of large rocks.  By then Chili Dog had gone ahead.  I started up the rocks but then had second thoughts.  The view was on a side trail and was not a required part of the hike.  And the rocks were challenging to get up with my useless left arm.  Suddenly I realized that there was no one coming behind me to know if I fell and hurt myself.  I turned around and came down so as to avoid any risk of further injury.  I heard a bullfrog;  I caught a quick glimpse of a pileated woodpecker; I saw a beautiful green frothy-looking flower; and I saw a mass of day lilies at the edge of the trail.  Diane had planned to walk out to meet me on the trail when I got close to the end.  I texted her when I was 1.8 miles out.  She started hiking, then realized her car was in the wrong parking lot. She went back and moved the car.  Then she started out again.  After quite some time she texted me that she had hiked north instead of south and was turning around.  She had been thinking about how some people hike north and others hike south and was picturing seeing me come down the trail when all of a sudden it struck her: she was supposed to be headed south.  A novice's mistake.  By the time we met I was just a few hundred feet from the endpoint.My friend Paul/Big Dog, who lives in Allentown, was going to meet us but was not at the parking lot when I arrived.  We drove to meet him at a Burger King to talk about his joining the group for the last part of Maine.  Then he invited us home for dinner.  We had a lovely meal with him and his wife Haunani - perfect trail magic for a quiet Independence Day.  
I broke the glass screen on my iPhone today.  I dropped the phone at Dan's Pulpit, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't broken then.  Several photographs later I noticed the screen was shattered.  I think maybe I smashed it up against a tree when I was coming down from  Balance Rock.  So getting a new phone with a sturdier case is now added to the list of chores for tomorrow.
Tomorrow we're also working on figuring out how to improve my nutrition and buying food.  Thursday I have an orthopedist appointment in Winchester, VA to get my cast off.  Hooray!","Hawk Mountain Rd., Eckville, PA

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571109,"Today was the day of my appointment at the orthopedist in Winchester, VA.  I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get the appointment, and I was hoping that it would be the last one. The original doctor said the cast would need to be on for three weeks, then I'd wear a splint for three more weeks.  That was four weeks ago.  Today's x-rays of the wrist showed that the fracture was not yet completely healed.    The physician's assistant gave me the option to take the cast off but said that she recommended it stay on for two more weeks.  I'm being cautious at this point so I opted to keep it.  I could keep the same cast or get a new one.  My purple cast was dirty and very stinky, so I decided to get a new one.  An assistant came in and sawed the purple cast off.  My skin underneath was shriveled but otherwise okay.  I flexed my wrist, and it hurt.  A lot.  The new cast is day glow yellow, a bright color to cheer me up.  Not getting rid of the cast was a major disappointment.  The next step is to see another orthopedist further up the trail in two weeks.  I looked ahead on the schedule and determined that we'll be near Monroe, New York in two weeks.  I looked up orthopedists there and called one.  In order to get an appointment I have to send all my medical records first.  This is not as easy as it sounds.  I have to sign a medical release and fax it back to today's doctors so they can forward the records to the next doctors.  I photographed today's x-rays on my phone so I can email them.  The hotel we're at tonight wouldn't print out the release form until the manager gets in tomorrow morning.  So I anticipate half a day tomorrow just trying to get the medical records sent.  After the doctor appointment Diane and I went grocery shopping.  I've been trying to locate UHP milk, which is shelf stable, since the beginning of the hike.  I want it to increase my protein intake and also to get more calcium to help heal my broken wrist.  We finally found some at a grocery store in Winchester today.  The store had 26 three-packs of individual servings, and I bought them all.  Milk is a staple of my diet at home, and it pleases me greatly that I'll now have some on the trail.  Occasionally Lizzie or I have bought a quart of milk to split, and we've drunk it all in a single sitting.  Now I'll have a steady supply for a while.  Yesterday Diane and I shopped for more hiking shoes and for some shorts that fit.  We found some mid-height hiking shoes and two pairs of shorts that fit at an outfitter in Winchester, Virginia.  So nearly all the tasks I intended to do this week are complete.  The only one we didn't get to was cleaning my pack.  I was hoping to do that because it's now getting stinky.  Most of the group is back in Harrisburg.  Terri is supposed to be here somewhere with her husband.  Bill, Arlene, Diane, and I are sharing a room.  Bill gets to sleep on the floor.  Diane is headed back to Wisconsin tomorrow morning.  We have to find our way to Duncannon to meet Rennie with the van.  Lizzie is planning to meet us tomorrow night at the campsite at Clarks Valley.  I'm looking forward to starting hiking on Saturday.  It was good to have a break from hiking even though I never really got to relax.","Winchester, VA

She's my closest friend, and I've really missed her this summer.  We didn't get any real rest time, but my body got a break from hiking.  Today's hike: We now have only one vehicle, so shuttling the van has taken more time than usual.  We didn't get on the trail till about 7 o'clock.  Bill, Arlene, Terri, and I started out together and stayed together most of the day.  After a long initial climb we stayed up on a ridge all day. There were no views.  The temperature was about 70, and occasionally there would be a light breeze - perfect hiking weather.  Some of the trail was rocky; some was muddy; but mostly it was not very difficult.  We hiked 16 miles at about two miles an hour.  Toward the end of the hike we passed through a very pretty meadow that had lots of butterfly weed.  There was a stream right near the end that had a place to wade.  We stopped to soak our feet in the cold water.  A large fallen tree served as a bridge over the stream.  It was slick when Rennie crossed in the morning, but by the time we got there it was dry and easily passable.  We ended the day in Swatara State Park, which does not allow camping.  We found some good camping spots up the trail and set our tents up.  We hoped to get them dried out from last night's rain.  We were just settling in when a ranger came and rousted us.  We called Rennie, and he drove us to a nearby Days Inn.  The Expedition camps at a lot of places that are borderline illegal or outright illegal.  We try to be discreet.  But this is only the second time we've been thrown out of a place.  It's not a good feeling.Group news: Terri McClure, who left the group about three and a half weeks into the hike, is back.  She left because of a knee injury, which turned out to be bursitis.  While off, she hiked the 118 miles between Bland, Virginia and Catawba, Virginia to rehab her knee and get prepared to come back.  I used to tease her about wearing lipstick on the trail.  She's now wearing mascara as well.  I've given her the new trail name Lipstick.  Lizzie is not bringing her car back.  Her friend Patti is bringing her to hike today.  Lizzie texted to say she wouldn't be finishing till late.  Belated Terri McClure (HYLO, or Hike Your Legs Off, or Lipstick) profile, about age 60, is from Salem, Virginia (near Roanoke).  She is newly retired from a big railroad company, where she did something related to taxes.  She has a degree in accounting and is a Certified Public Accountant.  Like Bill and Arlene, she is a U.S. Navy veteran.  She's been hiking since college, when she took a course in hiking and backpacking, and is a fast and proficient hiker.  She and her husband have climbed quite a few of the over 14,000-foot mountains in Colorado.  She has a good eye for spotting birds and small mammals and frequently notices insects.  Quite a few times she has stopped to watch insects at work or play (i.e., mating) and caused us to notice them, too.  About a month after she started dating her husband she bought herself a wedding dress, having figured out that they would be getting married, even though the groom didn't yet know!  She is generous and often buys salty treats for the group in the form of various types of chips.  She's stubborn and determined to finish: she came back to the Expedition even though she knew she would have to make up 500 missed miles after reaching Katahdin.  She's at a transition point in her life.Wildflower report: The summer wildflowers are here!  We saw butterfly weed aswarm with butterflies and bumblebees, masses of purple coneflowers also covered with butterflies and bees, and day lilies near every road crossing.  We also saw some white-blooming rhododendron - very pretty.Bear sighting: We drove to a campground not far away to a restaurant for dinner.  On the way back to the trailhead a large black bear ran across the road in front of us.  This bear is mine to name, something beginning with I.  I'm calling it Irene.What we smell on the trail:  - wet earth after rain, - mushrooms after rain, - honeysuckle, - multiflora rose, - many light floral fragrances whose source is hard to identify, - sycamore trees (unpleasant) - pine trees and other conifers, - vague manure-like smell under large thickets of rhododendron, - skunk (occasionally), and - day hikers' deodorant, shampoo, soap, and other products.  We can usually smell them from about five feet away.  Tomorrow we will cross the 1,200-mile mark.  This means we'll have less than 1,000 miles left to hike.  Amazing!  The hike is racing by.","Clarks Valley, PA 325

Arlene, Bill, Terri and I started out together.  Although Bill sometimes went ahead we hiked together most of the day.  Later Lizzie caught up with us, and the five of us hiked together.  I love these people; they feel like family.  It's hard to believe that they won't be in my life forever.For most of the day we walked along a ridge.  We walked across a beautiful old bridge (see photo).  In several places the earth was covered with ferns as far as the eye could see.  We saw fairy wand (see photo). There were rocky places where even the really large rocks tilted under our feet.  There were rock outcroppings from which we got panoramic views of farmland below and the next range of mountains beyond.  There was a cooler of ice cold drinks at a road crossing. There were trail angels at the next crossing giving out all kinds of food: yogurt, hummus, protein bars, lemonade, Gatorade, candy bars, pudding, dried fruit, packets of tilapia.    (Applejacks, one of the trail angels, thru hiked the trail last year.)

Her knee has a deep dirty gash that curves to open as a flap.  We're urging her to go to a doctor tomorrow to get it really cleaned and maybe stitched.  Still later Terri fell while crossing a stream on rocks but didn't appear to be hurt.  We didn't get in till about 8:30.  The next few days we have shorter hikes, mostly 14 or 15 miles.

It's probably the only big thing she's ever done just for herself.  It makes me sad to even think about it.Just yesterday when we passed the 1,200 mile mark we seemed so strong and confident.

The last mileage listed was Katahdin 965 miles.  Every time we realize that the remaining distance is under 1,000 miles we marvel again at how far we've come.  We all still remember that heady feeling of reaching 100 miles.  That seems both really long ago and also just yesterday. It's probably hard for readers to imagine, but our 15.7 miles per day pace seems really fast to me.  We reached our endpoint, Hawk Mountain Road in Eckville, around 5 o'clock.  That gave us some time to set up our chairs and talk at the end of the day while we packed our food for tomorrow's hike.  So far we haven't had many such short days, so we relish the times when we can relax a bit before going to bed.  There's a shelter a quarter mile down the road with flush toilet and solar shower, but we all opted to camp here instead.  The shelter itself was already full when we arrived, and about eight people headed to the tent camping space after that.  So we passed up showers in favor of quieter, more private space.  A tough decision.  Tomorrow's hike is 11.5 miles.  It's the section that I hiked last week when my sister Diane was visiting.  So I won't be hiking tomorrow.  I wish I could say I'll be lounging around reading a book, but I expect it will take me all morning to get an orthopedist appointment scheduled for Monroe, New York.  That's where we'll be in two weeks when my cast is due to come off.  Since it's a short day today, the group is planning to go to the movies to see Wonder Woman.  And, fingers crossed, I'll go with Warren to pick up Lizzie from the hospital.  Thanks to all who sent good wishes to her.  Morph, she says she does not blame the rock, she blames gravity.","Port Clinton, PA

As I had feared, this took all morning to set up.  I've been working on this since last Friday with no success.  Yesterday I received an email from medical records telling me they had received all my records and I could now call the main number to schedule an appointment.  I called the main number, and the scheduling person insisted that I couldn't possibly have received such an email because the practice doesn't send emails.  And they didn't have my medical records.  Argh!  I was so frustrated I felt like crying.  Today the doctor who is CEO of the practice called, and he couldn't have been more accommodating.  He gave me an appointment for the day and time I needed to fit into the hiking schedule.  The hike today was relatively short (11.5 miles), but it was rocky.  This is the section I hiked last week so I didn't hike today.  I recalled that there were some rocks, but I told the others it was similar to yesterday's terrain.  On their return they informed me that it was much harder than yesterday.  I guess the week's time lapse caused me to forget just how rocky it really is.  In the afternoon we took the van into Allentown to see Wonder Woman.  There were some very funny parts near the beginning, and we all laughed hard.  Arlene has a hearty and infectious laugh, and she sees the nuances of humor in every situation.  Being with her has caused the rest of us to laugh more often and to laugh harder.  What a great thing!  After we started laughing the whole audience started laughing, too.  It made the whole movie better.  When we got back to the campsite Lizzie was there, and we got to say goodbye before she left to recuperate.  Big Dog was also there and had brought us bananas, apples, and gooey chocolate cupcakes.  It was another very full and very good day even though I was not on the trail.For a preview of tomorrow's hike check out the photo in my August 21, 2016 journal entry.","Blue Mtn.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571975,"It was a long and strange day.  I climbed a steep rock face dripping sweat in early morning, climbed over a steep place called Knife Edge in a downpour in the afternoon, and am now in my tent in my wool long underwear for the night.  And I got kicked out of a bar for the first time in my life.  
The hike today had several rocky, dangerous places to climb.  The steepest climb with the biggest potential fall was at Lehigh Gap, about five miles from the end.  Warren shuttled us to do that section first while we were fresh and the day was not yet too hot.  The climb up the rock face there was difficult, and I needed both arms to pull myself up in some places.  I tried to use the left arm mostly to balance, but I had to pull myself up with it several times.  
Once we reached the top the trail ran along a grassy ridge with nice views of the Lehigh Valley.  (This section of the trail is a detour to avoid a Superfund site where zinc smelting from 1898 to 1980 caused deforestation.). There were lots of blackberries and some blueberries.  We stopped to eat some of each (later realizing that probably wasn't such a good idea).  There were also some ripe wineberries and lots of wildflowers: thistle, salsify, hop clover, bladder campion, sweet peas, Deptford pink, milkweed, yarrow, crown vetch, white clover, red clover, and bleeding hearts.  There were several wildflowers that I hadn't seen before.
After we finished that section Warren shuttled us back to Lehigh Gap so we could hike south for the rest of the day.  This was also along a ridge.  We found lots of ripe blueberries, and I had my first ever huckleberries.  Several sections required climbing over big rocks.  We were over the first difficult section when it started to rain (sometime after 3:00).  It rained hard for several hours.  When we got to the Knife Edge it was still pouring.  Bill, Arlene, and I were so scared we took a pee break before we started.  We all just peed on the rocks where we were standing.  We were already soaked to the skin by then, and I started to get chilled.   We stayed very close together while we pulled, pushed, and scooted ourselves over the narrow edge of slanted rocks.  I was far too focused on each move to take any pictures.  After that there were several more miles, some with rocks.  We finally got back to where we were camped about 7:00.  
There was a restaurant/bar nearby, where we hoped to get dinner.  I grabbed some dry clothes and headed there.  I hoped to change into the dry clothes in the restroom.  I stood beside the sign that said please wait to be seated.  I still had on my wet poncho.  After a minute the owner came out from behind the bar and asked me what I was doing there.  I said I wanted to get dinner, there would be three of us, and could I please use the restroom to change into dry clothes.  He said, ""No, you can't bring that stuff in here.  Take it outside.""  I went out to the van and undressed there.  I couldn't find my dry pants, so I went back to the bar in a dry top but my wet shorts.  We got dinner.  The owner kept asking everyone what they were doing there and seemed to be in some kind of argument with the waitress.  He was quite drunk.  We were glad to get out of there and back to our tents.

The weather forecast was for rain all day.  We started the day putting on our wet clothes, shoes, and socks from yesterday.  Not my favorite thing.  It was foggy when we started, and it remained foggy all day.  We hiked through mud puddles and then up a big field of rocks.  It was steep but there were steps going up part of it.  (In some really steep places on the trail flat rocks are moved into place to form staircases.  The stairs are irregular in size, but they're easy to stand on because they're flat.  They help quite a lot in really steep places.)  We were anticipating more rocks through the day, but most of the walk along the ridge was not challenging.  Even though it wasn't raining at the start I wore my poncho.  I hoped to dry it out by wearing it. By mid morning my clothes were nearly dry.  My underwear and shirts are all wool, so they provide warmth even when wet.  My body heat eventually dried them and my nylon shorts.  Arlene, Bill, and I hiked together and talked about all sorts of things.  Bill posed two questions for discussion.  (1) What would your perfect day be?  (2) Who would you invite to be house guests if you could have three people - one for a weekend, one for a week, and one for a month.  We all pondered this for a while.  It was interesting to see the different approaches. Arlene immediately thought of a person to cook for her and to teach her how to cook and an entertainer who would make her laugh.  I was thinking about world leaders.  Bill just pondered but didn't offer anything.We stopped at a shelter for lunch and chatted with several hikers.  By the time we left, around 1:30, it was raining moderately hard and starting to get windy.  I stopped to put on a heavy fleece underneath my poncho.  After several hours the rain stopped, and I again started to dry out.  We finished hiking shortly after three.  Since it is a town day, we had made a reservation at a hotel.  Arlene, Bill, Terri, and I are sharing a room.  We've now had showers, done our laundry, eaten large amounts of food at a diner, and shopped for groceries.  I'm very sleepy.  (The time I spend writing this journal comes out of my sleeping time.).  Tomorrow is our last day in Pennsylvania.  Sunday we'll cross the border into New Jersey.

For the past several days we've been seeing - and eating - this kind of berry.  The ones we saw today grew on very short bushes, and the berries were nearly on the ground.  We also met a nice ridge runner named Master Splinter (see photo).  (Ridge runners are hired by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to patrol the trail to encourage hikers to obey the rules that apply to each section of the trail.  Various sections restrict or prohibit camping in areas that have suffered environmental damage from overuse or are being reforested.).

As we finished Terri got a box so she could take her macaroni and cheese for lunch tomorrow.

The rocks of Pennsylvania continued into New Jersey, and we picked our way carefully across them.  It was a bright sunny day with blue skies.  There were lots of people out hiking, including one Japanese group of perhaps 30 people.  We hiked alongside Sunfish Pond and admired the stone sculptures at the north end.  These ""sculptures"" were actually rock cairns made in many shapes and forms.  Farther up the ridge we stopped at a powerline crossing, where a turkey vulture was perched airing out its wings.  The rocky crest of Kittatinny Mountain afforded beautiful views on two sides: on one side the Delaware River, on the other a reservoir (see photo).  Some miles into the hike we reached a road and turned left for the Mohican Outdoor Center, a facility run by the Appalachian Mountain Club.  We had lunch there - delicious sandwiches made from mozzarella, hummus, roasted red peppers, etc., chips, orange juice, and ice cream bars. There were lawn chairs in front of the building, and Bill talked to a woman who was there on a retreat with her quilter's group.  He sent her over to me, and I stepped momentarily back into my normal world of quilt making.  I also talked to a woman who was just finishing her first year of retirement.  She had spent it driving around the United States visiting her friends and relatives from all parts of her life.  What a great idea!Much of the hike was over grassy, lightly wooded areas with lots of blueberries.  We stopped often to eat them.  One powerline right of way had fields full of bergamot, black-eyed Susan, and thistles.  We didn't get to the endpoint until 6:30 because we stopped at several viewpoints along the way.  It was an extremely pleasant day.  At the endpoint we cut open the watermelon Lizzie had bought before she got hurt and left.  I got a text from Lizzie that she may be back as early as Tuesday, the day after tomorrow.  Hooray!","Delaware Water Gap, PA

Wiping the sweat off my arms and face made me feel clean.  (We're never really clean out here, just more dirty or less dirty).

Bill and Terri set up their tents, but I decided to chance having to put it up in the rain later and didn't set up.  While we were in the restaurant eating the rain came down very hard.  When we got back to the road crossing where we were camping the rain had stopped, and the ground wasn't even very wet.  We were able to pitch our dry tents in dry weather.  This makes up some for the many days when we hurried to beat a storm but got drenched very near the end of the hike.  Highlights of the hike: We finally came to the end of the long rocky section that began in Southern Pennsylvania.  We walked through some very pretty fields and saw many wildflowers: Queen Anne's lace, bergamot, thistles, Deptford pink, milkweed,  and others that I've forgotten(see photo). We saw a touch me not that was a golden yellow, unlike the orange and lemony yellow ones I see in West Virginia (see photo).  One section went through a wetland via a long bog bridge (see photo above).  There we saw cat tails, skunk cabbage foliage, arrowroot, and swamp rose which had a delicate sweet smell.  I also saw two tall purple flowers that I've never seen before.  This section of the trail wanders along the New Jersey-New York state line, sometimes crossing, at other times approaching, and at still others running along the border.  Tomorrow we'll be crossing back and forth; on Thursday we'll leave New Jersey for good.  Tonight we're camped off the trail in Unionville, New York.  I'm set up on a cushy bed of moss.

More.When we started, early, the trail passed through farmland that was shrouded in fog.  As the sun got higher we started to see lots of wildflowers - horse nettle, deadly nightshade, bladder campion, Black-eyed Susan, moth mullein, thistle, spotted touch me not, and masses of bergamot (see photos).  There was a section of road walking where we saw lots of chicory just starting to open.The trail then entered the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge, where it followed the perimeter. We arrived before 8:00 AM, when the dew was still on the ground.  There were two large marshes with cattails and tall grasses at their edges.  Red-winged blackbirds were perched on the cattails.  A great blue heron flew off into the distance.  We heard bullfrogs (which Arlene can now identify even though they don't say ribbit).  On the land between the two marshes we saw a snail, a monarch butterfly feeding on a milkweed flower, and Canada geese.  The trail turned right and headed up Pochuck  mountain.  At the top we looked out over a valley to the next mountain range.  At the top of that ridge was the obelisk that was the veterans memorial at High Point State Park.  This is where we were yesterday.  It looked so far away that it was hard to believe we had walked from there in just a day.  We looked up the word ""Pochuck"" and learned that it's a Lenape Indian word that means out of the way place.  Descending Pochuck Mountain we came to the boardwalk that the woman at the state park had told me about yesterday.  It was elevated about three feet above the wetland.  This was a wonderful place full of cattails, wildflowers, and very tall grasses.  The boardwalk meandered here and there, through woods, back into the open, across a stream, and through more woods for about a mile.  We stopped to look at the first stream and saw turtles and beautiful purple arrowroot flowers.  At the end there was an impressive suspension bridge across another stream (see photo).  It was an altogether delightful place.By now we were about 11 miles into the hike.  We came out onto a road where there was a garden center. In addition to plants and gardening supplies this place sold fresh produce, ice cream, and cold drinks, had a restroom, and had a spigot for hikers to fill their water bottles.  I had lunch: fresh cherries, almonds, a pint of whole milk, and a scoop of coconut chocolate almond ice cream.  Now that's my idea of lunch!From there we headed up to the Staircase to Heaven, a steep climb up Wawayenda Mountain over rocks.  Some massive engineering must have gone into this part of the trail because there were many stone staircases.  Although I call them staircases, they are quite uneven and often require stepping up 20 inches or so.  They are a help, but the climb was still difficult.  We were rewarded at the top by a view of two valleys and two mountain ranges that we had crossed on foot since yesterday.  Amazing!Tomorrow is shorter mileage (13.1) but will be a lot more rocky and difficult.  I'm anxiously awaiting my appointment with an orthopedist.  I hope my wrist is sufficiently healed that the cast can come off.  I need the use of my left arm and need to start getting prepared for the White Mountains.","Lott Rd., Unionville, NY

We try to keep three points of contact before moving a foot, but that wasn't always possible.  At some places I couldn't get my foot up and instead put my knee up and pulled myself with my right hand, with a little balancing help from my injured left.  In places with very slanty rocks I leaned into the rock and used my right hand on the rock to balance.  In some places coming down I sat down and scooted on my bottom till a foot touched down.  It wasn't stylish or pretty, but I got up and down all the rocks safely.  We hiked over Prospect Rock, Cat Rocks, and the Pinnacles.  From one of these it's theoretically possible to see the New York skyline, but today was too hazy to get that view.  It was very hot - the hottest day we've had so far - and we tried to minimize the amount of time we spent in the sun.  In these high open spaces there were lots of blueberries.   They were the sweetest blueberries I've ever eaten.  At 8:15 AM we reached the New Jersey-New York border.  The paint on the rock was behind a boulder, and it would have been possible to miss it entirely.  We stopped to take pictures.  I took a picture for a hiker trail named The Austrian and one for another hiker whose name I didn't get.Around 12:30 we reached a road crossing where hotdogs and ice cream were available.  We skipped the hotdog stand and headed straight for the creamery.  This farm has been around since 1824.  I had a large root beer float and liked it so much I had a second.  The place was very hiker friendly - had an outdoor spicket for filling up water bottles, lots of picnic tables outside, and a hiker guestbook.  The owner actually chased us down as we were leaving to get us to sign.  StaPuff told us he's seen three bears in New Jersey and showed us video he took of a porcupine waddling along the trail.Great news: Today was my orthopedist appointment.  They cut the cast off and took X-rays.  In the x-ray room I suddenly felt dizzy, as though I were about to pass out.  I put my head between my knees and asked for a drink of water.  I think this was sheer panic that the bone might not be healed, and I wouldn't be ready for the White Mountains in time.  But the news was good.  The bone is clinically healed but will take six more weeks to be fully healed.  The x-rays showed big white areas where new bone is being made.  But I have to continue to avoid weight-bearing activity for six more weeks.  I was advised that I shouldn't lift anything heavier than a coffee mug.  (As Charleston lawyer Matthew Victor would say of that advice, I'll give it the attention it deserves.  I've already been using the wrist more than that and will continue to do so.  Cautiously.).  I'm supposed to wear a splint most of the time but can take it off in the shower and in bed.  And finally, I should have one occupational therapy appointment to learn the exercises I should do.  We'll be starting the White Mountains in four weeks, but I should be ready by then.  It's a really good day.","Warwick Turnpike

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572740,"Today we pulled ourselves up over lots of rocks, just as we did yesterday.  Late in the afternoon we came to a place that was a wall of rock about seven feet high (see photo).  The photo, having no human in it for scale, does not do justice to just how challenging a place it was.  There was a blue-blazed trail that was marked ""Easy Way"", but we are not blue blazers (blue blazes are side trails, not the AT).  Terri and I scoped out the rock and decided to pull ourselves up by some tree roots, with a left foothold on a rock below.  Terri did it after a few tries.  I, however, could not get my left foot up high enough to put it in the foothold.  Momentarily I considered the right side of the rock, where there were many handholds and footholds.  But I didn't find a low enough foothold to get started there either.  Finally Terri took the ""easy way"" back down to help me up.  First we moved several smaller rocks in front of the rock to be climbed.  This got me about six inches higher, but I still couldn't reach the toehold.  Finally, Terri offered to give me a boost from below.  With that, I managed to reach the toehold and pull myself up.  If I'd been there alone, I'm not sure how I would have gotten up.  Not long after, Arlene and Bill came along.  Arlene couldn't get her foot into the foothold on the rock, and she was unwilling to let Bill give her a boost.  So Bill came up next.  While he was struggling to get started, Arlene walked over to the right side and pulled herself up there while no one was watching.  There were more events in the day - more blueberries, more rock climbing, more walking on boulders in high places, hiking through lovely grassy fields with trees interspersed on high places in Harriman State Park (see photo), and trail magic in the form of water and cold sodas at nearly every road crossing.  They were similar to yesterday, only more difficult.  Tonight my newly-splinted left wrist is sore from the two efforts of pulling myself up on rocks.  I hope tomorrow will be less hard on it.  I don't want to reinjure it or slow down the healing process.  Tomorrow's hike takes us to Bear Mountain State Park Museum and Zoo.  The AT runs right through it, and there are white blazes to guide us.  We have to arrive between 10:00 AM and 4:30 PM to get in, or else we miss that section of the trail.  We have to hike 14 miles to get there, so  we're starting early at 5:30.  I'm headed to bed early.  Note to Pam: thanks for warning me that my wrist would look like a chicken wing when the cast came off.  It does indeed look like a chicken wing, but so does the other one.  It's just that the other one is more sunburned.
Later note: Shortly before noon Arlene, Bill, and I came to a beautiful campsite.  It was a flat spot shaded by pine trees and cushioned with fallen pine needles.  A trail angel had affixed what appeared to be a permanent trail magic box to a tree.  The box was full of first aid supplies - bandaids, ibuprofen, antibiotic cream, etc.  We ate lunch, then spread our ponchos on the ground to take a short nap.  It was one of the most peaceful and relaxing times I've had on the entire trail so far (see photo above).  Although I didn't fall asleep, I rested comfortably.  I got up feeling totally refreshed and relaxed."," Lakes Rd., Monroe, NY

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572811,"Today the trail provided us an urban experience totally different from the rest of the hike.  We left early, at 5:30, because it was a 20.8-mile day.  The Appalachian Trail in this part of New York goes through through Bear Mountain State Park, one of the earliest New York parks built for city dwellers to use.  The white blazes took us past an exhibit about how trails are designed and made, a concession stand, a large picnic pavilion, picnic grounds, an inn, a lake, a museum, and a zoo.  A statue of Walt Whitman celebrated his ""Song of the Open Road.""  There was also a sad little zoo with two foxes, two bears, and a bobcat which I didn't see.All these areas were overflowing with families and children picnicking and swimming.  The crowd was predominantly Latino, and all kinds of Spanish language music was playing (Arlene in particular enjoyed the music).  This is not the demographic of the trail, which is overwhelmingly white with a smattering of Asians.The trail went right past the swimming pool, which had so many people in it that there was no room to swim.  Everyone was just standing in the water, spaced so as to be separated from the adjacent people.  Part of the reason we got up so early was that the zoo is only open from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  Since this is the official route of the AT, arriving outside of business hours means hiking an alternate blue-blazed side trail that goes around the museum and zoo. Consequently, you don't get part of the trail completed.  We had 14 miles to hike before getting there, so we left early.  The hike itself was long and difficult.  It featured lots of uphill climbs, some steep descents, and lots of confusing blaze markings.  One of the things that made yesterday so hard was that the trail was poorly marked.  In many places there was a blaze, with no apparent trail leading to it.  So some people went one way, and others went another.  This created two trails, with no indication of which was the actual trail.  Apparently the trail is so heavily used here that mistaken routes can quickly become equally as prominent as the real trail.  This was also true of the trail today. In addition, there were significant rocky ups and downs, so we arrived at the end point utterly exhausted.Tonight we're camped on the baseball field at Graymoor Friary. The Franciscan brothers here allow hikers to use this area to camp and have provided Portapotties and a cold water shower. There's no electricity or roof at the shower, and it's quite buggy.    I'm trying to decide whether it's worth the trouble to rig up my headlamp so I can see to take a shower.  Not only am I stinky, but I've got dirt all over my legs from kneeling to take pictures and taking the occasional fall.  I no longer wipe the dirt off my knees because that transfers the dirt to my hands.  Life out here can be glorious, but it's also really, smelly and dirty.","Arden Valley Road

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572917,"Tonight our tents are set up near RPH shelter.  This shelter is very near a road, and there is a persistent sound of traffic from the Taconic Parkway.  According to AWOL, the trail will pass underneath it .3 mile from here.  One of the strange things about hiking near New York City is the number of times the trail crosses major highways.  The sound of these highways is very loud and travels upward so as to be heard from quite a distance.  Yesterday from the top of Black Mountain we could hear steady traffic noise.  As we descended the mountain we came to a place where the slight decline became steep.  As we crossed the lip of the plateau the noise instantly became much louder.  By the time we reached the bottom it was roaring.  Hikers here cross a very busy four-lane divided highway with no traffic signal.  There is a wooded median strip, so we only had to cross two lanes at a time.  We waited till there was a clear space between cars, then raced across the lanes to the wooded median.  Then we repeated the process crossing from the median to the north side of the highway.  At another point we had to run across four lanes of traffic.  And at the exit of Bear Mountain Museum and Zoo we crossed another busy highway to get to the pedestrian lane of the Bear Mountain Bridge.  We walked in places that are clearly meant to be traversed by cars, not walkers.  It's one of the strange features of the trail - the footpath in the wilderness that crosses superhighways.  For about a week now we've been traveling at the same rate as a group of hikers: Scrambler, StayPuff, JK (for Just Kidding), and Blue Smurf.  They are younger and hike faster than we do, but we get started earlier. So we usually end up at the same place at the end of the day.  Recently we all met up at the creamery in midday; last night we ran into them at a deli close to our endpoint; today we all stopped for lunch at a road crossing where there was a water source.  It's been fun getting to know people outside the expedition group. This afternoon I hiked with JK, a 41-year-old woman, for several hours.  Her company got bought out, and she got a buyout package.  This left her free to hike the trail and think about her future life.  Like most of us, she's here at a juncture in her life - taking a step back from everyday life to clear her mind and decide what to do next.  We talked about all kinds of things, and I felt like we were friends by the end of the afternoon. When we got to the shelter, close to a road, we ordered pizza together.  Tomorrow she heads home for a few days for a break, and we continue hiking north.  I expect to see her somewhere up the trail.  Although the hike is still about the trail, it's also about the people on the trail that have become part of our lives.","Graymoor Friary

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573060,"Last night was one of those hot nights when I opened my sleeping bag and just used part of it as a blanket.  I woke at 5:00 to the sound of light rain.  Terri and I were on the trail an hour later. Shortly after we started hiking the rain became heavier.  For the next six hours we hiked in a steady hard rain - up over wet slippery rocks, through puddles and mud and down the same terrain.  It was painstaking work because there were lots of rocks to be crossed.  When rocks are wet they're slippery.  If they have moss or lichen on them they're even slicker.  Since I'm now painfully aware that just one wrong step could end my hike, I proceeded very slowly and deliberately.  It took us three and a half hours to hike the first five miles, less than one and a half miles per hour.It was 65 degrees when we set out.  I wore shorts and a short-sleeved shirt, with my poncho on top. Usually I wear my sunhat over the hood of the poncho, but it  hadn't rained in so long that I'd forgotten why I needed it.  Once on the trail the need became apparent: without something on top of the hood to hold it in place, it falls down over my eyes and also obscures my peripheral vision. For the first several miles I constantly tried to adjust the hood so that it didn't fall in my face.  No luck. Finally Terri remembered that she had a sun visor that I could put underneath the hood to keep it from falling in my face.  We slogged on like this for six and a half hours.Here are some things to know about hiking in the rain: - No matter what you wear, you will get soaked to the skin. - Within half an hour of hiking in the rain, your fingernails will be sparkly clean. - Once your feet are wet there is still strategy for approaching puddles. - If the temperature is high and the rain is warm, hike through the puddle. - If the temperature is cold, try to avoid the puddle.  The water already in your shoes will have absorbed some of your body heat and provide some insulation.  If you step in the puddle the partially warmed water is displaced by the cold water in the puddle.   - Rainwater tastes good.   - Once your shoes and socks are wet, water will squish out the top of your shoe when you step on a rock.   - If you have to start out with wet shoes, it helps to wear wool socks.  Even when they soak up water from the shoes they still provide insulation and warmth.Around 12:30 the rain finally stopped.  We were very wet and chilled.  We decided to stop at Morgan Stewart Shelter to take off our wet ponchos for a bit and have lunch in a dry place.  The shelter was completely full of hikers who were just waking up. They had decided to wait out the rain.  So we stood by the picnic table and ate lunch.  One of them told us the latest news on the trail.  A skunk followed a section hiker for a mile and a half, got into the vestibule of his tent, and sprayed him.  Rumor is that the hiker went home.Eventually we warmed up and picked up the pace.  During the last part of the hike we saw the Dover Oak, the biggest oak tree on the AT.  We met Crayola there and talked to her a bit.  The last part of the hike passed through a large wetland on a long boardwalk.  At the end of the boardwalk Scrambler caught up with us.  He'd been at the same shelter with us last night and had waited out the storm.  He started hiking at 11:30 and arrived at the endpoint at the same time we did - five and a half hours faster than our time. We stopped to take photos of the Appalachian Trail train stop. Then he headed off to walk an additional .7 mile to get to a deli.  We're now set up in a field beside the trail, Crayola having joined us for the evening.  I have once again retrieved my wool long underwear to wear to bed.  Apparently it will never be sent home for summer. Tomorrow we hike 18.2 miles, then head into Kent, Connecticut to pick up mail, get groceries, and do laundry.","RPH Shelter, Hortontown Rd.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573167,"In law school we learned the principles of primacy and recency: jurors remember best what they heard first (primacy) and what they heard most recently.  I've realized writing this journal that my mind works that way when I look back on the day.  I usually remember the beginning and the end vividly, but I sometimes forget things that come between.  For example, the day I saw my first rattlesnake on the trail I saw a bear near the end of the day.  I was so excited about seeing a bear that I completely forgot to mention the rattlesnake in my journal.  Today was like that: I remember the beginning and end of the day well, but much of the hike in between is a blur.  We got on the trail shortly after 6:00 AM in Pawling, New York.  The temperature was in the 50s, and it was foggy.  We crossed a road and got on the trail by climbing a stile over an electric fence.  On a hill to our left we saw a strange wooden water tower on a farmer's land.  For the first mile or so we walked through quiet pastures in the early morning mist.  The sides of the fields were bordered with bergamot flowers blooming in profusion.Shortly after we entered the woods it began to rain.  I opened my pack to get my poncho and discovered that I had left it in the van to dry overnight.  I rummaged around for the disposable plastic poncho I keep for an emergency and remembered that I'd taken it out when I decided to always carry the other poncho.  This struck a pang of fear in me because it was still in the 50s.  Fortunately, the rain stopped after just a few minutes.  (The temperature didn't get into the 60s till afternoon.)Today's hike was through woods very similar to those of the last few days: some rocks, some mud, some uphills, some rocks at the tops of the mountains, some down hills.  The highlight of the morning was crossing the state line, leaving New York and entering Connecticut.  Very gratifying.  We're hiking about 100 miles a week.  In the bigger states (Virginia, Pennsylvania) one week of hiking is just a small fraction of the state, but in this part of the trail 100 miles can mean completing several states.  We've started seeing southbound thruhikers, one yesterday and two today.  We finished the hike around 6:00 and are now in Kent, Connecticut for the night.  Arlene, Bill, Terri and I have an expensive but nice room in town.  We rushed to get groceries before the store closed at 7:00, then got showers in the room.  We couldn't go out to eat because most restaurants close at 7:00 PM.  It's now 10:20 PM, and we're sitting in the laundromat waiting for our clothes to finish drying.  Tomorrow we get to sleep in till 6:00 because the restaurant doesn't open till 7:00.  Wow!As always on mail pickup day I'm grateful to my wonderful friends for remembering me with goodies.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573305,"We woke up in our comfy hotel room this morning at 6:00, an hour later than usual.  The restaurant we found for breakfast didn't open until 7:00, so we told Warren to pick us up at the hotel at 7:45.  He had told us yesterday there was no rush in the morning because today was a shorter day.  We had big breakfasts and lots of coffee at the restaurant.  When we got to the van, however, Warren told us we needed to get ready as quickly as possible so that the southbound hikers wouldn't be too delayed.  Suddenly we were frantically putting stuff away: putting our clean clothes into our clothes bins, putting our groceries into our food bins, and packing our food into our daypacks for the day.  These are tasks that we normally do at night so that in the morning we can just pack up our tents, grab our daypacks, and go.  We finally were ready to leave at 8:45, nearly three hours later than usual.The first part of the hike was through pastures still wet with dew and bordered by Queen Anne's lace and bergamot (see photo).  The sun was shining, and the temperature was pleasantly cool.  There was a long climb that ended at a large rock outcropping.  We stopped to look at the view.  While we were there a hiker wearing a kilt came along, and we had an interesting conversation about how to get home from Katahdin (see photo).  Gourmet, so named because he cooks homemade dehydrated meals, is from Georgia.  His mother wants to drive to Katahdin to meet him at the end of the hike, but he's thinking he'll need some reentry time.  He's planning to drive to Portland, ME and take a train home from there.  What an interesting idea. About noon we reached a steep descent called St.Johns Ledges.  It had very steep stone steps down to the Housatonic River.  This was one of the steepest and scariest downhills we've had so far, and it took us a long time to pick our way down.  At the bottom, there was a long section that was on flat road and flat trail following the Housatonic River.  It was easy and pleasant walking with constant views of the river.  About halfway through this section we stopped at Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter.  We joined Blue Smurf, Gourmet, and Ranger Rick for lunch.  Blue Smurf had cowboy camped near the visitors center in Kent last night but had gotten no sleep because it was so cold.  (I'm not sure how cold it was, but when we walked to the restaurant this morning I wore my down jacket.). He wanted to hike slowly and offered to set a pace of two miles an hour for us.  This may be slow for him but is fast for us on anything but easy terrain.  Arlene and I took off and stayed with him until we reached the end of the long flat section.  Then Blue Smurf and I continued.  I ended up hiking with him all afternoon, and his pace helped me finish the day earlier than I would have otherwise.Blue Smurf is from Taiwan but has a green card.  He speaks perfect English from having lived in the United States.  In Taiwan he makes a living appraising jewelry.  He decided to hike the AT because his older brother had done it; before starting he had not hiked at all.  Where other than the AT would I have met a person from such a different background!  When I arrived at the endpoint Lizzie was back!  We've really missed her.  Her knee wound is not totally closed, but the part that went clear to the bone is.  So she's going to try hiking with us tomorrow.  While she was gone she drove up Mt. Washington in New Hampshire.  The day she was there it was 42 degrees and foggy with winds of 30 to 40 miles an hour.  Another day recently the temperature was in the 20s.  We hope it will be better weather the day we hike it.  This evening we had time to set up our camp chairs, eat together, and relax.  A friend of Bill's from his navy years 35 years ago joined our little party by the side of the road.  From listening to his funny stories it was obvious why they were friends.  They both have a well-developed sense of the absurd.  Connie, you asked whether Rennie was still with us.  He is, but he starts hiking so early (around 5:00 AM), finishes so early, and goes to bed so early (8:00 PM) that we hardly see him.  It's almost like he's on a different hike.  Morph, Lizzie says to tell you that she's having a hard time getting back into hiking because she's crusty.","CT 341, Kent, CT

There was a long gradual uphill at the beginning.  The first viewpoint we came to was Hang Glider View, from which we saw - and heard - a speedway.  Cars, maybe formula 1 cars, were racing around a curvy track.  It was very loud.  We heard it a long time before we could see it and continued to hear it long after it was out of sight.  For much of the morning we were on rolling ups and downs atop a ridge.  Then we descended to hike several flat miles through the town of Falls Village.  The welcome sign said it was incorporated in 1737.  This part of the country was settled long ago, and the woods are full of rock walls, which the New Englanders call stone fences.  The sheer number of these fences reminds us that these mountains have been settled for a very long time.  We crossed the Housatonic River, passed Housatonic Valley Regional High School, walked along a road with lots of wildflowers in bloom (chicory, goldenrod, bergamot, Queen Anne's lace, red clover), and reentered the woods.  When we emerged again we hiked across an iron bridge and on a road that took us to a large waterfall. There was a small building at the top of the falls, giving me the impression that these falls must have been used to generate power in earlier eras.

There the trail ran for more than half a mile along rocks that overlooked a beautiful valley.  The vegetation on top was different from any we've seen so far.  There were no tall trees, just varieties of pine and oak that are short and dwarf-like.  We saw many types of mushrooms, all fresh after yesterday's rain.  It made me think I should go back to learning about them.  Lizzie has now been back hiking two days and appears to be doing very well.  She's taking very good care of her wound and seems like her old (but young) self.  It's good to have her back.Tomorrow we have a short day (12.9 miles).  I hope this will allow me to get to bed earlier to catch up on sleep.","CT 41, Undermountain Rd.

We did go up some rocky hillside, but there was relatively little rock scrambling.  Coming down the last hill we came upon Ice Gulch, a deep gorge where snow and ice sometimes last through the summer.  (There didn't appear to be any today.).

Wilcox Arlene and I came upon Bill.  He was sitting on a rock at the edge of Benedict Pond.  When he got up he told us he'd been contemplating the nature of existence and had figured it out, ""The ineffability of God is in the quantum signature.""  This can't be known epistemologically but only ontologically.  Well!  My cup of McDonald's coffee didn't get me nearly as far.   Maybe I should have had a large.  I sat by the pond briefly but didn't contemplate the meaning of life or the universe.  Instead I thought how much the pond reminded me of the lake in Maine where our camp was during my childhood.  It felt really good to be there and to remember the happy times I spent there with my family.  We continued on as a group, with Bill talking about quantum mechanics.  From there he told us a story about Niels Bohr.  A young scientist came to visit Bohr and found him in his yard doing household chores. The young scientist noticed there was a horseshoe hanging on the house and asked Bohr if he believed that hanging the horseshoe on his house would bring him good luck.  Bohr replied, ""They tell me they work whether you believe in them or not.""Our next group stop was at a pond on top of Mt. Wilcox. There were dead trees in the pond, and we speculated on how they got there.  Then Terri noticed some nearby trees that had been gnawed by beavers and two beaver lodges.  We surmised that the pond had gotten deeper from the beavers' damming up the stream at the outlet of the pond.  One particularly large tree had been gnawed a lot but had neither fallen nor died.  Bill said the beavers had it on a 5-year plan.  We wondered: how big are bullfrogs?  What do beavers eat?  We continued hiking through evergreen forest.  In some places there were large patches of ferns, with at least three different kinds.  It was quiet in the woods - no birdsong, only the muffled sounds of our own feet on the pine-needle-covered ground.  We passed magnificent huge pine trees, some three feet in diameter. The temperature was perfect - neither too hot nor too cold, with a light breeze.  When we emerged from the woods the trail took us across neat pastures under a deep blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds.  The low humidity made the air clear, and everything looked fresh and clean.  We also passed through wetlands on boardwalks and bog bridges.  We stopped to talk quite a while to a local couple out hiking with their cute bulldog Hazel.  Merry, the wife, had thruhiked the Pacific Crest Trail.  This led to a discussion of where we all would like to hike: the Camino de Santiago in Spain, the Te Araroa Trail in New Zealand.  I want to hike the Allegheny Trail, which runs the length of West Virginia in the mountains.  (It would be shameful not to hike a substantial trail that's in my own backyard.). Arlene has decided she's not a long-distance hiker: she doesn't plan to hike anything longer that 45 days in the future!?! Merry is planning to hike the Trail du Mont Blanc, which is in France, Switzerland and Italy, next September and is looking for people to go with her.  We exchanged contact information.  About a mile from the end we crossed a paved road with a snack stand in someone's yard.  It was a closet-sized shed containing soft drinks, chips, cookies, Poptarts, etc. that you pay for on the honor system.  It even had books to exchange like a little free library and a picnic table in the shade.  We stopped there for a drink and chatted with a hiker called Spider Man.This day had a little of everything - varied terrain, beautiful weather, encounters with interesting people, coffee before the hike, and spare time at the end of the day to relax.  It's not the perfect day, but it's the perfect hiking day.","MA 23

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573767,"Today was a long hike, 18 miles through the woods.  The day began unseasonably cold again, probably in the high 40s. Terri headed out first; Arlene, Bill, and I followed. The day began with a long climb, so we were soon warmed up.  There was not much variation in the terrain today.  The highlight of the hike was passing two pretty ponds and swimming in one of them.  About seven miles into the hike we came to a historical marker for a large chimney.  The plaque memorialized the Mohhekennuck Club, which was incorporated in 1909 and had a lodge on the site for the next 72 years.  In 1982 the club conveyed the land to the National Park Service to be used as part of the Appalachian Trail.  Just past the chimney a short trail led down to the shore of Upper Goose Pond.  The pond was shallow there and had a sandy bottom.  Several feet out there were some large boulders and a sudden drop off.  It was still morning when we arrived and not particularly hot, but the sandy bottom looked good.  Bill and I decided to swim.The water felt cold when I first got in, but I got used to it quickly.  I swam out to the middle of the pond and yelled back to Arlene on shore, ""I'm clean.""  And I did feel clean for the first time in many days.  (Out here the term clean is relative.  It actually means less dirty, as opposed to more dirty.). It's been a long time since I swam in a clear New England lake or pond.  It felt wonderful.  If we hadn't had so many more miles to go I would have stayed longer.  After we swam the three of us ate lunch, each sitting on a separate rock.  It was 11 o'clock when we resumed hiking. Not long after lunch we came to an elaborate pedestrian bridge that took us across the Massachusetts turnpike. Peeking through the chain link fence, we could just see a sign on the overpass identifying the bridge as the Appalachian Trail.  The rest of the day was uneventful.  For the past few days we've been seeing different plants, trees, and flowers.  We've been seeing teaberry plants with their white berries, bunchberry plants with their red berries, and purple vetch.  We've also started seeing birches and aspens.  It feels like a prelude to reaching Vermont.Tomorrow we hike 18.9 miles.  At the midpoint the AT goes right through the downtown of Dalton.  We plan to stop for lunch there before doing the second half of the hike.  It's amazing how having a belly full of real food makes the hike go easier.","Tyringham Main Rd.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573881,"Today was another one of those unassuming but wonderful days.  The plan was to hike 10 miles to Dalton, MA, where the trail runs right through town, have lunch in Dalton, finish the remaining 8.5 miles of the hike, then go to Walmart to resupply.  It could have been a total rush and stressful, but somehow it wasn't.I left first shortly after 6:00.  I hadn't gone very far when I heard a white-throated sparrow singing.  This is my all-time favorite bird song.  It's pretty, and I remember hearing the song in the evenings in summer in Maine when I was a child.   So hearing it always makes me happy.  This is the first time I've heard  the white-throated sparrow on the hike.  It started my day off on a positive note.  Terri soon caught up with me, and we headed up the first big climb of the day.  Warren had told us that the hike was less difficult than most and that we'd have time to have lunch in Dalton and still finish in plenty of time.  I had set off at a quick pace and found the terrain much as described.  There was a flat section (!); the uphill was gradual; and the muddy parts were covered by bog bridges.  I felt like I was flying.  When we got to the top of the first peak Arlene caught up with us.  She felt like Warren had misled us because she had found the hill difficult.  However, when checking how fast she'd made it up the hill she changed her mind. The three of us hiked together for the rest of the day.We got to Dalton around 11 o'clock, which meant a pace of two miles an hour.  Dalton is a very pretty old town with some quite grand old houses, all immaculately maintained.  The trail followed the main street into town.  We went past a very old New England-style factory beside a dammed river that likely once was a power source for the factory.  On the sidewalk a large flowering of tansy dominated the weeds beside the road.  We passed a pretty house that had a sign over the front porch, ""Appalachian Trail, GA 1545, ME 639.""We had lunch at a sub shop, Angelina's, outside at a table with umbrellas.  A local woman stopped to ask us about our hike and to wish us luck.  Other hikers were sitting at the next picnic table, the group we saw yesterday with the little dog that looks like Asta (the dog in The Thin Man series).  We appear to have fallen behind StaPuff and Blue Smurf and are now with a younger group that's traveling about our pace for now. Now that we're this far along there's a new camaraderie among the thru hikers, almost as if we've recognized that we're all in it till the end and are likely to make it to Katahdin.  By the time we got up from lunch it was 1 o'clock.  We headed to Cumberland Farms, a convenience store, for ice cream.  There another woman stopped to ask us about our hike.  We left Dalton with an impression of a pretty town full of friendly people.  On one of the first uphill sections we stopped to figure out where the trail went over the rocks.  Arlene suddenly said, ""What's that creature over there on that rock?""  Terri and I looked over and saw a small brown mammal with a long body and short legs.  The animal ran over several rocks, then disappeared under another rock.  A moment later it emerged and looked at us before again running inside.  It did not appear to be afraid of us.  We guessed fisher cat, otter, and ferret before giving up and going online to search for it.  Our search for ""small mammal long body short legs"" pulled up descriptions and images for weasels.  Sure enough, that's what it was.  Terri and I were very excited to see a weasel for the first time.  Arlene, a city person, was less impressed.  Later in the afternoon we heard several pretty and interesting birdsongs which none of us could identify   I recorded some of them with the video camera on my phone so that I can look them up later.  We arrived in Cheshire at 6:00 and stopped at an ice cream stand for maple walnut cones.  We did go to Walmart to resupply.We're camped tonight on the back lawn of the Catholic Church in Cheshire, MA.  The church allows thru hikers to camp here and to use the restrooms in the church until 8:00 PM.  Tomorrow we're headed up Mount Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts.  Although the mileage is only 14.5, I expect it to be difficult.  One good thing though, there is a lodge at the top where food is served.","Pittsfield Rd.

The trail wound through the outskirts of Cheshire before taking us through a cornfield.  The rest of the hike was a long ascent to the top of Mount Greylock, followed by a long descent to Williamstown.  The trail winds through several streets here as well.I heard another white-throated sparrow, and I saw lots of turtlehead flowers.  Terri saw another small mammal that she couldn't identify - black with lighter fur on top and quite large.  Mount Greylock is the highest peak in Massachusetts.  Henry David Thoreau visited there and wrote about it.  There's a rock carved with his thoughts on it.  At the very top there is an interesting Art Deco style war memorial built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s to honor the dead of the Great War.  The Corps also built Bascom Lodge, which has rooms (for a mere $40 per night) and a nice little restaurant.  The style and furnishings of the lodge are Craftsman style, comfortable and pleasing to the eye.  Arlene, Bill, Terri, and I arrived at 10:45 and stayed for about two hours.  We wandered around the memorial, climbed to the top, looked over the mountains, and then had lunch in the lodge.  While we were looking out the top of the memorial we saw Lizzie and Patti arrive southbound.  They didn't stay long but continued on their way.Lunch at the little restaurant was very pleasant.  There was no air conditioning.  It was not very hot out, and the windows were open, letting in fresh air.  This was a real treat compared to most places where air conditioning is turned on whether or not it's needed.  The food was good.  After eating a hot ham and cheese sandwich, potato salad, orange juice, and coffee I went to the freezer to get an ice cream bar.  What appealed to me though was a lime-flavored popsicle in fancy dress clothes.  It was delicious.  When I finished I read the wrapper and said to Arlene, ""This has no fat and hardly any calories.  I don't know why I even bothered to eat it.""  We both laughed.  It's a new way of considering food for us.  The afternoon hike was uneventful.  Toward the end we heard thunder, and a threatening wind arose.  We arrived at the endpoint around 4:15, just minutes before a downpour.  This evening we did laundry, ate, went to an ATM, put our clean clothes away, and packed food in our packs for tomorrow.  We're staying tonight at a very interesting bed and breakfast, River Bend Farm.  It's in a house that was built in 1770 and has been maintained in nearly original condition.  It has been operated as an inn since it was first built.  It has electricity and other amenities but is otherwise like a museum of that time period - a really lovely place.  The floorboards in the kitchen are 15 to 24 inches wide.  Imagine the trees they came from!  I wish we had more time to hang out here and enjoy the place.  The owner is getting up early tomorrow to feed us breakfast at 5:00 so we can be back on the trail by 6:00. Tomorrow we hike 18.4 miles, which will take us to Bennington, Vermont.  Farewell, Massachusetts.  It was great!","Church St./School St., Cheshire, MA

It was green on top but had a yellow underbelly and chin.  This is the first bullfrog I've actually seen.  At one road crossing there was a poster explaining the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department's effort to reintroduce martens to this area.  The creature was described as brown, about 2.5 pounds, and about the size of a house cat.  The picture showed a small creature with alert eyes, rounded ears on top of its head, and a long slender brown body.  Arlene said it looked like a cat-monkey.  We did not see any martens or any cat-monkeys.At one point I checked my mail and found I had a message from my guest book.  A reader named Alan wrote that he has been following this journal and the one by Terri, another expedition member.  He has been inspired to start dreaming about a hike of his own and has mailed some off-trail magic to the group at Hancock, New Hampshire.  I continue to be amazed at the generosity and kindness of complete strangers.  When we were about 2.5 miles from the end of the hike we started hearing thunder.  It wasn't frequent, but it sounded close.  We geared up to thunderstorm speed and kept hiking.  The last half mile was a very steep downhill, with some stone steps - very scary.  Our goal was to get there and get down before the rain started.  We were lucky.  We managed to finish the hike, pitch our tents, and get our packs ready for tomorrow's hike before the rain started.  It has now stopped and is predicted not to resume until tomorrow morning after 7:00.","MA 2, Williamstown, MA

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574316,"I started the day thinking I'd lost my hiking stick.  This was a very bad thing: Vermont is full of mud, and I need that third leg to help me negotiate the mud and wet rocks.  We were just hoisting our packs to leave when I discovered my stick was missing.  Rennie had already pulled away in the van.  I ran down the road waving my hands and yelling, ""Stop, stop!""  With some difficulty I managed to flag down the van.  I opened the door to look for the stick where it's normally kept.  It wasn't there.  Rennie said he'd take all the sticks out of the van.  I headed back wondering where I could find a suitable  branch to use.  We headed to the trail.  Chili Dog, a hiker I first met at Dan's Pulpit the day I hiked alone in Pennsylvania, was leaving at the same time.  He called out that there was a stick right on the trail.  It was my stick.  Then I remembered that I'd set it there last night when I arrived because I desperately needed to pee.  I peed against a tree and accidentally left my stick there.   The weather forecast was for rain around 1:00, so we tried to make good time in the morning.  The beginning of the hike was an ascent of Stratton Mountain.  There is a fire tower there that has good views in fine weather.  By the time we got there the mountain was fogged in, so we didn't climb the tower.  There's a small white building there that we wondered about.  It turns out that the building is the residence of Just Jean and her husband Hugh, who are caretakers of the tower and the land around it.  The Green Mountain Club employs them, and they live there from May to October.  They've been connected to this place since 1977, when they were hired by the state of Vermont to be firespotters.  Just Jean told us that yesterday a southbound hiker arrived saying, ""I need to sit down now before I faint."" He was very weak and sick.  Jean, suspecting Lyme disease, took the hiker to the medical clinic at the Stratton ski resorts be checked out.  This was a major event in their caretaking routine.Stratton Mountain didn't used to be part of the Appalachian Trail.  However, the mountain plays an important part in hiking history.  It was here in 1909 that James Taylor conceived the idea of a ""long trail"" that would extend from the Massachusetts border to Canada.  While the Long Trail was under construction, Benton McKaye conceived the idea of a trail that linked all the mountaintops of the entire Appalachian range.  The idea of the Appalachian Trail was born.  The AT was rerouted to include this location once this was known. Before the AT passed here, Jean saw about four hikers a year. Will hike for ice cream: When we met Rennie headed south he told us there was a ice cream and snack stand about half a mile east of our end point.  From that moment we were in a race to finish hiking in time to eat ice cream before the stand closed at six.  We took almost no breaks for the rest of the hike and picked up the pace for the last four hours.  We succeeded in getting there before six, then learned that it didn't close till eight or whenever the food ran out.   I had a grilled cheese sandwich and two scoops of black raspberry ice cream, which I turned into a float by pouring lemonade over it.  Bill and Terri each ate four scoops of ice cream in addition to other real food.  We had our first ethical trail dilemma today.  We were hiking along when Bill heard a noise.  He discovered a garter snake had captured a frog and had one of the frog's back legs in its mouth.  The frog was squealing piteously.  Bill wondered whether we should try to help the frog escape.  Terri immediately responded, no, we should let nature take its course, the snake had to eat.  I responded yes, because the frog was in terrible pain.  Bill wondered whether we should kill the frog to put it out of its misery.  Finally Arlene caught up and responded, ""This is the wilderness.  We're only visitors here.""  Argument over.  We could all understand this and moved on.  I think that's what Terri had also been trying to say, but Arlene captured it so succinctly that it ended the argument.  We slogged through a lot of mud today, and we got rained on for several hours, but it was a much better day than yesterday.  I mixed an instant coffee packet into my UHP (Ultra High Pasteurized/shelf stable) milk this morning and got my caffeine dose. This put me in a much better frame of mind.  Perhaps my headache and lethargy yesterday arose from caffeine withdrawal.  Tomorrow we hike over Bromley Mountain.  It's supposed to be 72, with no rain.  I'm looking forward to it. My feet are so wet, and I'm running out of dry socks.Grace, I thought of you when we crossed a road called Stratton-Arlington road and when we looked out over Manchester Center from Prospect Rock.  Meggie, I think my mystery bird might be a hermit thrush.  Morph, what makes Vermont have so much mud in high places?  Mel, thanks for the cowboy breakfast cookies.

Surprise number two: the building that contains the chair lift equipment for the Bromley ski resort looks like it just landed from outer space (see photo).  Really cool 1950s or 1960s space-age design.On our way up to the next peak Terri and I met yoyo hiker Norm.  He started at Springer on March 15, has already finished at Katahdin, and is now headed back to Springer.  He averaged 23 miles a day northbound but is now hiking about 18 miles a day southbound.  While we were talking Arlene caught up with us (see photo).  When she learned about his yoyo hike she exclaimed, ""I'm done!""   Norm didn't look emaciated or seem crazy, but doing a round trip hike on the AT is, by definition, fairly crazy .  At Styles Peak there was a large rock facing the sun, and we sat down to have lunch.  The rock provided shelter from the wind, and the rock itself was warm.  Here we met Happy Hour, a hiker in his 20s.  He has already thru hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and was comparing that to the AT.  According to him, the PCT has easier terrain but is harder to plan logistically.  This is because there are fewer services that cater to the needs of hikers, so way more planning is needed for resupply.  He recommends Craig's PCT Planner, Yogi's Guidebook, and Guthook's app.It was windy when we continued after lunch.  For the first time in many weeks we heard trees creaking and making sounds suggesting they might fall.  We saw some moose poop beside the trail, and we started walking as quietly as possible in hopes of seeing a moose.  We came to  Griffith Lake and sat down to watch for moose.  We were soon too cold to sit and started hiking again.  The third big surprise of the day was Baker Peak.  There were huge rocks to scramble over to get to the top (see photo above). The view from there was stunning (see photo).  We could see 180 degrees down a valley with farms, a town, mountains, and a large white area that we couldn't figure out.From there it was both literally and figuratively downhill.  For much of the remaining hike I stumbled and kept losing my balance.  I fell three times, each time getting a new scrape on my right knee.  I also managed to scrape both legs.  This worries me.  I think this is all because I'm tired, but there are no rest days scheduled. Tomorrow we have a shorter day (14.6 miles), but the following two days are 20-mile days.  I hope I'm ready for the Whites when we get there.","VT 11/30

(My  new plan for morning coffee is to mix a packet of instant coffee and UHP milk in a bottle.).  We headed out shortly after 6:00.I was in a black mood.  For the past two weeks I've had some kind of small slip or fall every day.  But for the past two days I've fallen three or four times.  This has made me lose confidence in my hiking skills.  Before the last few days I was feeling strong and well-prepared for the Whites, but now I'm not so sure.I headed out alone to have some time to think.  Thinking didn't help.  It made me glum.  After a few miles I reached Little Rock Pond.  The sun was just rising above the trees.  Mist was rising over the water.  Four ducks were swimming, just far enough from shore that I couldn't get a good look.  I was hoping for loons, but what I think I got was coots.  It was quiet except for the sound of a distant woodpecker.  There was a big rock to sit on, but I passed it by.  The trail continued to follow the shoreline.  Eventually I came to a small beach and sat down on a rock.  I looked at the pond for a while, then wrote an email.  Terri came along, and I told her what was troubling me.  She reminded me that we've been hiking long miles, and a few days ago raced through the last ten miles to get ice cream.  She said I was just tired and shouldn't get discouraged.  A few minutes later Arlene came along and gave me a similar pep talk.  I got up and continued hiking.After a while we came to a place with a small flat spot that had four or five massive boulders resting on a bed of soft pine needles.  People had picked up rocks and made sculptures all over the boulders, in between the boulders, even in the trees (see photo).  It was so peaceful and beautiful we decided to sit down for a snack.  While we were there Heat Wave and Snacks came along (see photo).  We spent quite a while there, and Bill made a sculpture to add to the collection.  I started to feel better.  Not long past there we came to a similar rock sculpture garden, but this didn't have spaces between the rocks, and it felt cluttered.  There was no place to rest the eye.  A side trail there took us down to White Rocks Cliff (see photo).  We sat on the cliff for a long time enjoying a wonderful view of Rutland, its airport, and more mountains and trees (see photo).  A young couple was there, and we talked to them.  In a great quirk of fate Bill finally met Roscoe G. Tanner.  For several years Bill has been thinking that if he got another dog he would name it Roscoe G. Tanner.  When he meets a dog along the trail he always asks the owner whether the dog is Roscoe G. Tanner.  Of course, the owners say no and think Bill's a bit simple. Today we met a southbound hiker with a brindled pit bull mix dog.  When Bill asked him whether the dog was Roscoe G. Tanner, the owner said, ""He's Roscoe.  Who's Roscoe G. Tanner?""  Bill explained that this was a dog name he was saving, but this Roscoe could have the name if he wanted.  The owner replied that he liked the sound of it.  Bill said, ""You can do whatever you want with the G.""  We talked for a bit with the hiker and then moved on, Roscoe having acquired a new last name.The last overlook of the day was a rock from which you can see the Rutland airport.  There I got a text from Terri that Warren would take us to town when we got back.  We immediately started thinking of food and hurried to finish the last mile of the hike.  Warren took us to Denny's, where I ate a gargantuan dinner.  Once my belly was full I felt a great sense of satisfaction.  It's hard to eat enough calories out here to cover the calories we burn hiking 12 hours a day. Today, for once, I felt like I didn't end the day with a deficit.  The next two days are 20-mile hikes, our last two.  On Friday we'll be in Hanover, NH for a town day, only hiking 10 miles.  My college roommate Meggie will be meeting me there. I'm really looking forward to this.","Danby-Landgrove Rd., USFS 10

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574664,"Yesterday was a very hard day.  We started out slow because I was nauseated and tired.  By noon I felt better, but we'd already lost a lot of time.  We spent a lot of time talking to southbounders, and we spent time at lunch getting to know Carmen San Diego and Waterboy, two NOBOs we've been seeing for several days. Soon we were very behind schedule to get in before dark.  We ended up finishing at 9:30, having hiked the last hour in the dark.  It was a very long day, lots of climbing - no views.  It was scary hiking in the dark.  Today was another very long day.  We had resolved not to spend time socializing since we had 20 miles to hike.  Even so, we took a break almost right away.  Warren said there were no views, but he was wrong. Not long into the hike we arrived at Thundering Falls, a very high set of cascades with streaks of water flowing down many different places (see photos).  Then there was a nice boardwalk through an area full of Joe Pye weed, goldenrod, and other late summer flowers (see photo above).  From there we headed up Quimby Mountain, where we found some trail magic.  Someone had left a bag of big juicy oranges. Bill, Arlene, and I sat down and each ate one.  Farther up the mountain we came around a corner and saw the top of an extension ladder sticking up above the top of a rock promontory (see photo).  The thought of having to descend backwards down a ladder leaned against a rock wall prompted me to use some very bad language.  This made Arlene laugh because this is quite uncharacteristic for me.  Much of the rest of the day was just hard slogging up hills .  In late afternoon we reached a side trail for a place called the Lookout.  Just as we started up toward it rain came up suddenly.  We put on our ponchos and continued toward the top.  There we were surprised to find a completely enclosed cabin, with a ladder to a platform high on the rooftop.  We sat inside with several other hikers and waited out the storm.  It's the first time we've ever been at a place where we could take shelter when a storm came up.  We felt really lucky. After the storm had subsided we went up on the roof platform to see the view.  There were clear views in all directions - well worth the extra effort to get there.We left there about 5:15 with 6.8 miles left to go.  We hiked fast.  Even though the ground was wet, the terrain wasn't difficult.  We got in around 8:15.  Warren had bought pizza, and Terri had bought a blueberry pie to celebrate our last 20-mile day.  Tonight we are camped in a cow pasture adjoining the trail.  I tried to set up where I'd avoid the cow manure, but as there's plenty of it elsewhere in the field my tent is still smelly.  Tomorrow we have a short day, just 12 miles. I hope to finish early enough to get some extra sleep.","VT 100, Killington

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574774,"Today was to be a short day.  Warren billed it as 12.6 miles, but it was actually 13.3. (I counted this as 13.1 because somehow my cumulative mileage in the journal was over by .2.).  We regarded this as an opportunity to relax and sightsee on trail.  Warren offered to shuttle us to Hanover at the end of the day so we could get some of our town chores done early.  (Tomorrow is the official town day after a 10-mile hike.)  He noted when we left that all of us would likely finish by 3:00 or 3:30.  The hike was a pretty one through varied terrain.  After one long climb at the beginning, we spent the rest of the time hiking up and down short hills.  We passed through pastures, piney woods with no undergrowth, birch woods. For nearly a mile the trail was on an old dirt road with tall stone fences on each side.  Large trees were planted at regular intervals on the right.  This place felt like the setting for a fairy tale.  We saw a lot of mulberry bushes in the pastures.  I stopped several times to eat mulberries or raspberries.  These were short stops: although there many berries, most were not yet ripe.  We also saw a lot of wildflowers in the fields we crossed.  We decided to go to a farm market for lunch when we reached it about halfway through the hike.  We also wanted to make it to the end in time to take showers at the Hanover (NH) Community Center.  The Center closes at 5:00, so we figured we needed to reach our endpoint in West Hartford by 3:30.  We allowed ourselves 20 minutes for lunch, and that was plenty of time.  It was a short walk along a pretty country road to the market, which was located in a house. We ate our sandwiches on the front porch looking across the road to fields of wildflowers and a bright blue sky with puffy cumulus clouds.  When we resumed hiking we picked up the pace so as to average two miles an hour.  Terri and I arrived about 3:15; Arlene and Bill arrived about 10 minutes later.This is when we learned that Warren had planned to have a meeting about our strategy for hiking the Whites.  He also told us that last call for showers at the community center was 4:30, so we were likely too late.  This caused major dissension in the ranks.  Both Bill and I told Warren that if he had wanted us to finish by 3:00 he should have said so directly.  We could have finished by then if we'd known.  We were very displeased that we might not get showers.  In the end, we rushed to Hanover, and we all did get showers.  However, there was only one shower there, so this took a long time.  Once I got under the hot water I didn't want to leave.  Everyone else had the same experience.  We told Warren we didn't want to meet tonight.  Arlene, Bill, Terri, and I had dinner at Molly's downtown.  The food was good, and we had time for a beer.  It felt very good to sit on the patio and eat a real meal.Wildflowers: bergamot, goldenrod, Deptford pink, Black-eyed Susan, daisy, orange hawkweed, St. Johnswort, red clover, spotted and yellow touch me not, thistle, Joe Pye weed, yarrow, Queen Anne's lace (see photos).Tomorrow we'll be shuttled back to West Hartford to hike to Hanover.  We'll cross back into New Hampshire and start hiking our next to last state (that's penultimate to you, Diane).  It's another short day, so I should be able to do all my chores and still have time to spend with my old friend Meggie, who'll meet me on the trail. I'm really looking forward to seeing her.","VT 12, Woodstock, VT

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574878,"Today was a short hiking day but a long working day.  We hiked from West Hartford, Vermont to Hanover, New Hampshire - a distance of 10.5 miles.  We camped in Hanover last night, so Warren shuttled us to the starting point.  We stopped en route to get coffee and take-out breakfast, so we were well-fed when we started hiking at 6:45.  There was a road walk of about a mile at the beginning and a road walk of about two miles at the end. In between the trail wandered up and down over pine-needle-covered paths.  My college roommate Meg was to meet me in Hanover.  She parked at the Food Coop and hiked south to meet me.  The two of us got to the end point at 12:10 PM.  Bill and Arlene arrived somewhat later, having been lured away from the trail by the aroma of coffee wafting from a business downtown.  Bill has a tooth with a filling that is coming out and was able to get a dentist to make him a temporary filling.  Warren had told us in the morning that he wanted to meet to discuss the Whites as soon as everyone got in but no later than 3:00.  When we arrived, people had scattered to do their errands, and Warren was very angry.  The meeting at 3:00 was mostly about the logistics of who was staying in the huts in the Whites, how people are getting home from Katahdin, etc.  He surveyed us as to who were planning to ford the Kennebec River and who was planning to take the canoe ferry (the official white-blazed part of the trail).  He criticized those who planned not to ford as being fearful.  I'm not tied to any macho goal of taking unnecessary risks.  I have fallen enough on rocks, wet and dry, on land without having to ford a river whose bottom is covered with slimy river rocks.  The reason the official trail was changed to include the ferry is that the Kennebec is dammed upriver, and the dam is opened at irregular and unannounced times.  If you are fording when the gates are opened you may be drowned by the rising water.  Warren claims that you can time your crossing to take place when the risk is low and views any other approach as cowardly.  After the meeting there was a flurry of activity to pick up mail, do laundry, shop for groceries, etc.  There is no laundromat in Hanover.  The senior center has a single washer and dryer, which makes laundry a drawn-out affair.  Fortunately, Meg had lived in West Lebanon, the next town, some years ago and knew her way around.  She took Arlene and me there to do laundry and run our other errands.  While our laundry was washing Arlene was able to get a haircut, something she has been wanting to do for weeks now.  I got a new dry sack at LL Bean.  We both got groceries.  And the three of us had dinner at a nice local pub in Lebanon.  Many thanks to Alan S for the bag of ginger lemon cashew bars.  I shared them with the group after the meeting was over.  Tomorrow we hike 18.9 miles, our first full day in New Hampshire.","VT 14, West Hartford, VT

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574975,"It rained overnight, but it was not raining when we set out at 6:10.  We walked through mist/cloud for much of the day.  The woods were quiet for long periods of time.  It was a lot of miles with not many views expected or seen.
At Moose Mountain South Peak, about the halfway point, Arlene and I sat down to eat lunch.  Fog was moving up the mountain to where we were and dissipating.  Pretty soon Bobby Joe arrived, headed south; Lizzie and Patti arrived also headed south; and Bill arrived from behind us.  We all ate snacks or lunch, then headed back out.  It was a rare occasion when most of us were in one place on the trail.Later in the afternoon we came out to a road crossing and discovered trail magic.  Marsha and Dennis, sweethearts and hikers, were in a parking lot serving hotdogs, potato chips, and cold soft drinks.  Terri was sitting in a folding chair talking to them.  Arlene and I joined her and fixed ourselves hotdogs.  By then the sun had come out, and it had turned into a pleasant day.  
It was nice sitting in a chair and getting to relax with local folks.  Marsha and Dennis both had strong New Hampshire accents.  Arlene has been eagerly anticipating hearing real Maine accents, so she enjoyed hearing the New Hampshire version of a New England accent.  We asked what the likelihood was of seeing a moose.  They were not encouraging.  The moose population in New Hampshire has declined by 60 % in recent years because of an infestation of ticks.  The ticks attach to the moose young and take so much blood from them that they become too weak to escape predation from black bears.
We got into camp shortly before 7:00. I made it through today's hike with just one minor fall, but on the way to setting up my tent I tripped over the stones to a diversion ditch and fell hard on my left hand and right knee.  The two middle fingers on my left hand were bent back the wrong way and are now very sore.  My knee was scraped up.  My legs are a catalog of scrapes, cuts, and scratches.  Sometimes I look at the younger women hikers and marvel at their flawless uninjured legs.  
Tomorrow is another long hike, 18.8 miles.  I'm finished with my chores at 9:00 PM, so I may actually get to bed early tonight.  That would be heavenly.","NH 120, Hanover, NH

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575095,"Today was another long hard day.  We climbed two big mountains, Smarts Mountain and Mount Cube.  Both had substantial sections of rocks and roots and some steep sections.  I was moving slow in the morning.  I'm not a morning person, and physical exercise first thing in the morning just about kills me.  I don't know how I've managed to do this all summer.  It's really hard.  This morning I had no form of coffee before starting and was particularly slow.I forgot to mention that yesterday we had our first section that had rope set up for us to use.  I tried it out, even though it was in a not particularly steep section.  It was helpful.  Today we had a steep section that had three consecutive types of assistance: a log ladder (see photo), followed by stone steps, followed by rebar set unto the rock to make a ladder.  At the top of Mount Cube we saw our first cairns.  These are piles of rocks placed to indicate where the trail goes (see photo above).  They replace or supplement white blazes and are meant to be helpful in foggy conditions when low visibility would make it hard to locate the blazes.  We started the day in fog, but by the time we got to the top of Smarts Mountain the fog had cleared.  It turned into a bright sunny day, neither too hot nor too cold.  Terri and I stopped to have lunch at Eastman Ledges, a rock outcropping on Smarts Mountain with good views.  We planned to limit the break to 20 minutes because we knew it was a very long day.  I planned to take a 10-minute nap, then eat my breakfast concoction that my old roomie Meg made for me.  (It has granola, almonds, powdered espresso, and powdered milk in a Ziplock bag.  I add about half a cup of water and have a powerful breakfast - 460 calories, 16 grams of protein.). But then Bill and Arlene showed up, and our 20-minute break turned into a 45-minute break.  From then on I knew I needed to hurry to make it in before dark.  When we met Bobby Joe going south he told us about the omelet man.  This man has set up a camp near NH 25A and serves free omelets, juice, and bananas to thru hikers.  Terri and I decided to try to make it there before he stopped serving at 5:00.  I soon realized that I couldn't hurry down the mountain: there were way too many slippery rocks and roots. Terri went ahead and got her omelet.  I didn't get there until after he had closed down the grill.  Apparently I could have gotten juice and a banana, but I was in a real rush.  I continue to see lots of locals out using the trail - walking their dogs, running, taking walks.  It's nice that the trail gets so much use.  This afternoon I met a couple who had really unique walking sticks (see photo).  The husband made both sticks out of tiger maple that he got on Mount Cube.  The sticks were painted in bright colors and looked like folk art.  We chatted for a bit, and the woman paid me a big compliment.  I had told her I was exhausted; she told me I looked in really good shape for having hiked so far.  Maybe I don't look as haggard as I feel.Tomorrow we hike over Mount Moosilauke.  We're going to hike the first five miles, to the next road crossing, without packs.  Then Warren is going to shuttle us to the north end of the hike for us to hike south.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575204,"Today was our first day in the White Mountains.  First we hiked about 5 miles northbound.  Then we shuttled north and climbed up and down Mount Moosilauke southbound.  This was 9.3 miles and took us 8 hours and 45 minutes- barely one mile an hour.  We hiked south so as to do the steepest part going uphill.  Most of the ascent was masses of boulders and was very steep.  For much of the ascent we were beside a very long set of cascades (see photo).  Before we started up, we saw a sign warning inexperienced hikers that this part of the trail is too dangerous and telling them turn around.  In some of the steepest places there were aids such as wooden block steps and rebar.  There were many places where the trail was beside a steep drop off to the cascades.  We spent about 45 minutes at the summit of Moosilauke and took a 10-minute (timed) lunch break.  Other than that we hiked continuously.  We saw Blue Smurf  at the summit and were surprised that he's not far ahead of us.It was all worth it when we got to the top.  It was a bright, clear day.  We could see many ranges of mountains in all directions, and we got our first look at Mount Washington.  The summit of Moosilauke is above tree line and is a gently rounded hill.  So it felt like we were standing in a big field at the top of the world.    It felt like we were seeing the curvature of the earth.  A plaque there commemorated the gift of the summit land to Dartmouth College in 1920.  This blew my mind - the thought that this magnificent place could be the private property of two individuals.  When we got to the bottom Bobby Joe took us to get dinner and ice cream on the way back to where we'll resume tomorrow.  Patti took me aside to tell me that I, and everyone else, need to eat more.  I'm doing the best I can.  One of the best things about getting to the end of this hike is that I'll be able to stop force feeding myself.We passed the 1800 mile mark today.  Tomorrow is another long day with more difficult terrain.","NH 25 C

When we got to the tree line it became very windy and cold.  We stopped to put on more clothes.  I added my heavy fleece, windbreaker, fleece hat, and sock mittens.   We decided that we should all keep in sight of each other until we got back below the tree line.  At the top fog was blowing across the mountain gusting about 30 miles per hour.  This felt very cold.  It was okay so long as I kept moving, but stopping for even a moment made me cold.  Several times when it looked like Bill was about to engage in conversation I told him we didn't have time to talk.  I also frowned on taking pictures.  It was scary up there: we could have been blown off the ridge onto rocks.  I wanted to get off the exposed section as soon as possible.  When we were partway down Mount Lafayette the wind started blowing the clouds off the mountaintop, and suddenly we got great views all around us.  I took a few pictures and then hurried on.  Once we got below tree line, we stopped at a sunny place to eat.  Going down the backside of Franconia Ridge was way more difficult than coming up.  There were lots of boulders and difficult places to get down.  Each of us fell several times.  Once when I fell hard on my bottom Bill waited till I got up, then said, ""There's a consolation prize.  When you hit the ground the slug that was crawling up your sleeve flew off.""  Yuck!The last few miles were awful.  They were very steep descents and then at the end very steep ascents.  I arrived at Galehead Hut utterly exhausted.

But I spent most of the day focusing on getting the hike finished early so as to avoid hiking at night.  I never know what kind of terrain to expect so as to estimate how long it will take.  It's incredibly stressful.  New Hampshire is beautiful.  I'd like to come back sometime and hike from hut to hut at a relaxing speed.  That would be so much more enjoyable than racing through.It was nice staying at Galehead Hut.  The public area of the building was a large open area with picnic tables for dining.  There were bookshelves with nature books and games to play.  The sleeping quarters were bedrooms with bunk beds - three high, reached by ladders.  The bathrooms had some kind of composting toilets and sinks with cold water only.  The ""croo"" that staff the place announced last evening that the lights in the public area would be turned off at 9:30 and they would come around and wake us up with something musical at 6:30.  Coffee would be available at 6:30, and breakfast would be served at 7:00.  I slept really well, turning out my light at 10:00 and sleeping until 6:30.  I was able to dry out all my sweaty clothes, including socks, by hanging them on the hooks in my little sleeping compartment.  The wake-up presentation was a guitar and the croo singing ""You Are My Sunshine.""  It was really pleasant to wake up to that rather than to an alarm.  I hiked alone for most of the day.  I started out with Lizzie but fell behind when she got into high gear.  I missed Arlene and Bill's company and made almost no stops.  Tomorrow we hike up Mount Washington to Lakes of the Clouds hut, which is about a mile and a half below the summit.  This is a total of 11.5 miles - all uphill.  We're leaving at 6:00, which should get us to the hut in time for dinner at 6:00.  I'll be walking with Arlene because Bill is hiking south from the summit of Washington.","Galehead Hut

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575681,"Our little group went back and forth about whether to stay for breakfast at the hut.  We were concerned about how much hiking time we'd lose by waiting: we're usually on the trail by 6:00, but breakfast isn't served till 7:00.  It's a hearty meal: oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, maple syrup, juice, and coffee.   We finally decided that starting the day with these extra calories (and caffeine) was worth the cost in hiking time.   Staying for breakfast, we didn't start hiking till 8:00.  We ended up hiking for over 12 hours to reach our endpoint, with just a 20-minute stop at the top of Mount Washington and a 12-minute timed break at Madison Springs Hut.  It was a very hard and long day.This morning, as the croo member was reading the weather report for intermittent clouds and visibility at 1/16 of a mile, the wind started blowing the clouds away, and suddenly the area surrounding the hut became visible.  It was a beautiful sight.  The hut is nestled in a low point overlooking several lakes and surrounded by rocks and alpine vegetation (see photo).  We stepped outdoors and found that the temperature was already warm.  There was only the lightest of breezes.  This was a huge relief!  The Mount Washington summit has some of the worst weather in the world.  Apparently it is located where two prevailing wind patterns collide, so it gets weather that's extreme.  Temperatures as low as -47º F and wind speed as high as 254 miles per hour have been recorded there.  There has been measurable snowfall in every month of the year, and people have died of hypothermia and exposure even in summer months on days that started out sunny and warm.  Near the top of the mountain there is a warning sign: ""This area has the worst weather in America.  Many have died there [sic] from exposure, even in the summer.  Turn back now if the weather is bad.""  I stopped to photograph Arlene/Staples there in her Annie Smith Peck pose (see photo).  Peck, the 19th century mountaineer, suffragist, and feminist, is one of Arlene's heroes. 
The hike up Mount Washington was a steady but gradual climb.  When we got to the top there was a line to take pictures with the summit sign.  However, the line moved fast.  We got our pictures taken at the summit sign, spent a few minutes looking at the views, went to the rest rooms, got snacks, and took off again.    The hike along the ridge took us from cairn to cairn over rocks, mostly large ones.  It was difficult terrain to cross, and we realized we'd be lucky to maintain a pace of one mile an hour.  We passed over Mount Jefferson and Mount Madison.  After our brief stop at Madison Hut, we climbed a very steep area that required the use of hands to ascend. We continued on for many miles.  At one point we got a view of a row of cairns stretched from left to right along the ridge that was the upcoming trail.  Each time we came to a cairn we hoped it was the last one, but we were disappointed over and over.  The day went on forever.  By the time we got down to more level terrain, it was dark.  We turned on our headlamps.  While picking our way carefully through the dark, I tripped, dropped my hiking pole, and landed standing on top of it.  It snapped near the place where it telescopes to a smaller length.  This is the pole I ordered to use in the White Mountains, and I've only been using it since Hanover.  It lasted a mere 8 days.  Fortunately, Bobby Joe was using two poles and was able to lend me one until we got to the end of the day's hike.  When we finally emerged from the woods at Pinkham Notch Visitors Center we learned that a Forest Service ranger had kicked out all campers.  As we had been planning to camp nearby, we now had no place to go.  We went inside the center to kill some time while other plans could be made.  I comforted myself with two ice cream sandwiches and another pair of Darn Tough wool hiking socks.  
While we were waiting, we ran into Blue Smurf.  He became hypothermic in the rain yesterday and had to be taken to an emergency room.  He was caught in the rain in his down jacket and got drenched to the skin.  (Down loses all its insulation property when it gets wet.)  A while after he left Mount Washington, he realized he was too cold to continue.  He turned around and headed back to the Mount Washington Visitor Center.  Fortunately, one of the employees there noticed him looking not quite right and called for emergency help.  We're now stealth camped at an undisclosed location.  Tomorrow we're hiking up Wildcat Ridge to Carter Notch Hut.  It's 5.9 miles, but Warren says it will likely take us 8 or 9 hours to hike.  More hard work.

Today's hike was 5.9 miles up Wildcat Mountain.  It took us a little less than eight hours to do.  In the morning Warren drove us from our secret camping place back to Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, with a stop at a convenience store on the way to pick up breakfast (mini donuts, whole milk, coffee).   The Visitor Center has a hiker room downstairs with restrooms, coin-operated showers, and vending machines.  We all got showers and started hiking around 8:30.  It's an amazing feeling taking a shower after ten days without one.  We left with clean bodies and full bellies.  The ascent up Wildcat Mountain was very steep and rocky.  We put our hiking poles away and propelled ourselves up rocks using both arms and both legs.  (I still had my original noncollapsible hiking pole that I had been using before we reached Hanover.)  It was very slow going.  Sometimes I slid backwards, which was very scary.  Sometimes my left leg wouldn't reach up to a rock, and I had to push/pull myself up onto both knees and stand up from there.  I can't rely on my left wrist/hand/arm because the broken wrist is still not fully healed.  I'm especially cautious going downhill.  When in doubt, I sit and scoot my butt down till I get to a foot placement.  Sometimes this is on wet rock, which causes the slide to get out of control.  In the shower this morning I discovered I have calluses on each side of my tailbone from so much scooting down rocks. Making me a hardass as well as a badass.I've fallen many times in recent days and have many scrapes and bruises.  There's a huge bruise on my right hip and leg.  It hurts to sit down, so I guess there's a bruise on my tailbone as well.  There are eight scrapes and cuts on my right knee and four on my left.  My pants are abraded and have two holes in the right buttock; there's a tear in the right knee from a fall yesterday.  My knees have started to hurt enough that I need to take ibuprofen to get through the day.  (Until the last few days I hadn't taken any regularly since early July).  My feet have some awful condition (trench foot?) that seems to have been caused by too many days of continuously wet feet.  Despite all this I feel incredibly fit.  My ankles are very strong.  When I land wrong on a rock I'm able to correct it instantly.  I haven't twisted my ankle since Tennessee.  My legs and hips have the most amazing configuration of toned muscles.  This is what hiking up and down mountains for 15.7 miles a day has done to me and for me.  We're only a little more than 300 miles from the end.  Later this week we enter Maine.  It's hard to comprehend that we've walked (and climbed and crawled) here all the way from Georgia.","Pinkham Notch, NH 16

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575816,"Today was a lot harder than it looked on the AWOL profile, and it took me eleven hours to hike the 15.3 miles.  We had another hearty breakfast at the hut and left together at 8:00.  We had planned to leave at 7:30 because we knew it was a hard hike.We climbed Mount Hight, Middle and North Carter Mountains, and Mount Moriah.  Most of these ascents were not too steep, but the descents were quite steep and rocky, requiring a lot of care.  It was a sunny, mild day in the mid-60s, with just a little breeze.  This terrain was close enough to regular conditions that we abandoned our recent practice of all hiking together.  I hiked with Bill and Arlene till about 12:45, then stayed at my own slow but steady pace without stopping.  I didn't want to end up hiking at night again.  On Mount Hight we ran into Heat Wave, a woman in her late 20s who had been keeping a similar pace as our group.  She had a banged up knee and a blackish eye from falling hard on rocks.  She had taken two days off and hiked neros (very short, near zero hikes) on two other days.  She was just getting back to her normal pace/mileage. The most exciting part of the hike was at the very end.  When I was about a tenth of a mile from the endpoint, I saw a large black object crashing through the woods toward the trail from the left.  I kept walking till I realized it was a bear.  About the same time the bear saw me.  It stopped and looked at me, then continued running across the trail into the woods.  It was only about 75 feet away, so I got a good look.  I'm so happy to finally see a bear!  In our group naming ritual this one calls for a name starting with M.  I'll ponder this to pick a good one.There was an eclipse today, but I was in the woods and didn't really see it. 
Another gear problem: When my new hiking stick broke two days ago I didn't worry about it. I still had the nice stick I've been using since we started at Springer Mountain.  Today, however, that stick broke.  It snapped about 14 inches from the bottom when I leaned on it hard.  It lasted 1900 miles, which I guess is pretty good for carbon fiber.  However, I'm now left without any hiking stick.  Arlene has offered to lend me one of her spares, since she bought a new pair at Pinkham Notch.  
Tonight five of us are sharing a family room at a hotel in Gorham, New Hampshire.  Tomorrow we have a day off!  After doing laundry and errands I hope to hang out in the cafe/bookstore and also find an ice cream parlor.","Carter Notch Hut

The area ahead has the worst weather in America.  Many have died there from exposure, even in the summer.  Turn back now if the weather is bad.""  We were fortunate to have good weather through most of the White Mountains, but I always had a nagging worry in the back of my mind when we were at high elevations or above the tree line.  Rennie, who is a very experienced hiker and mountaineer, had several close calls that left him shaken.  Once he slipped and started running to try to catch his balance.  He stopped just before the edge of a cliff.  Another time he fell and slid on his belly about 20 feet, coming to a stop just before a tree branch hit him on the forehead.  None of the group had any major injuries, but we all fell many times and had bumps and bruises.  I don't mind difficult climbs and descents, but I don't enjoy the dangerousness of it.  I'm not a thrill seeker.  In the group, we're mostly relieved to have finished the Whites.Rest Day: We spent much of our ""rest day"" doing errands to prepare for the hiking days till our next town stop.  We got groceries and did laundry.  In between, some of us got ice cream and ate at the local cafe/bookshop.  I got a pedicure/foot massage to pamper my poor feet.  I don't think it helped them, but at least they're clean (free of the mud that was ground under the toenails) now.Thanks:  Once more my friends, family, and former coworkers sent lots of goodies on mail day.  Thanks to Will for the eclipse cookies and miscellaneous other goodies (Janice was right about the fruitcake); to Tony for the Easter bread and cookies; to the AG's tax folks for the snack packs of cookies and nuts; to Meggie for the almond M & Ms; and to Morph for the letter helping me regain perspective on the journey.  You guys are the best!Tomorrow we'll be hiking across more mountains, starting at 5:30, getting ever closer to Maine.","Gorham, NH

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576140,"Today was our last full day in New Hampshire.  We started hiking the Mahoosuc Mountains.  The hike was 15.2 miles on the AT plus 2.5 extra to reach where the van was parked.  The trail was not particularly difficult, but there was just lots of it - lots of uphill, rocks, mud, steep downhills, etc.  Lizzie was tired and stayed with me today.  It took us nearly 12 hours to finish.  Warren picked us up at the hotel at 5:00 so we could be hiking by 5:30.  He was not going to stop for coffee, but Lizzie started questioning him about what was so difficult about the trail that we needed to start early. Then Warren remarked that I was very quiet this morning. I said that I liked to ease into the day and not talk till after I've had my coffee.  ""If I don't get any coffee, I could stay like this all day.""  He relented, and we got takeout coffee.It was a clear pretty day, and the views from the mountaintops were beautiful.  There was a lot of deep mud on Mount Success, and I had no success avoiding it.  In trying to get around a big mud hole I completely missed the solid land and went into the bog ankle deep.  The mud came over the top of my shoes and soaked my shoes and socks.  So even though there was no rain I'll start tomorrow with wet shoes.  Lizzie and I amused ourselves by figuring out who would play the characters in the Expedition in a movie. Terry Gross would play me, and I would play her interviewing me.  Arlene would appear as herself.  Katie Couric would play Terri.  Warren would be an animated character.  Bill Nye the Science Guy would play Bill. I can't remember who we picked to play Rennie.  We didn't cast the Lizzie part.Guest hiker: We have a new guest hiker.  Randy is a retired school principal from the Lexington, Kentucky area and is section hiking the AT.  For the past several years he's been alternately hiking for two weeks, then going home for two weeks.  (This seems like it would be a really difficult way to do it.  He's probably just starting to get fit when he leaves for home and loses the fitness he gained before returning to the trail again.)  He's going to be with us till Rangeley, ME.  When we were packing our food for tomorrow he said, ""You guys are really fit.""  I reminded him that we just hiked 1900 miles worth of mountains to get that way.  Guest hiker: We also have an 82-year-old man, Grey Beard the Adventurer, who's trying to set a record as the oldest person to thru hike the AT.  He has about 700 miles left to do and is starting to doubt that he can finish.  He stays and travels in a van outfitted with a bed and storage space.  Hiking with our group alleviates the need to locate people to shuttle him to the trail or his van.  He joined us the day we started up Mt Washington.  Guest hiker: Bobby Joe, who is about 66 or 67, is a retired Delta pilot from the Atlanta area.  He's been hiking for many years, having started when his son was in Boy Scouts.  He's tall, has long legs, and hikes fast.  He started the trail very early this year intending to do a thru hike, but he broke his ankle in February and had to go back home till it healed.  He returned to the trail with his truck but generally spends nights in a hammock.  He joined our group in Hanover, NH.  He generally hikes south with Rennie.  He intends to stay with us till we reach Mt Katahdin, then go back to make up the miles he missed.  Today we passed the 1900 mile mark - actually three of them.  I'm not sure which is correct, but I photographed the one on Wocket Ledge because it had the best view (see photo above).  Tomorrow we cross into Maine, our last state.  We have less than 300 miles to go.","US 2, Gorham, NH

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576141,"What a glorious day!  We are in Maine at last!  Although we hiked only 8.4 miles on the trail, the actual hike was 4.5 miles longer.  We had to hike 2.3 miles up Success Trail to get to the AT in the morning and 2.0 miles to get to Success Pond Road this evening.  In between we had a fun and beautiful hike.  There were many places where we had to climb up or down very steep rocks.  Sometimes we were able to get up by the use of handholds, footholds, or tree holds, but there were several places where the trail goes up a sheer rock face.  In these places the trail maintainers had installed rebar hand and foot holds to create ladders.  In other places there were actual ladders.  In one very boggy, very hilly place there were bog bridges with steps on them.  I have really come to enjoy rock climbing, but I still don't like the descents.  Last August I hiked for a week on the AT in central Maine and was overwhelmed with how beautiful it was. I've been wondering whether I'd have the same reaction now that I've hiked 1900 other miles of trail and seen many beautiful places.  Well, it still looks just as beautiful to me.  The air is clear, and the mountains look lush, rather than stark as they did in New Hampshire.  The highland bogs and scrub vegetation are unusual and beautiful in their own way.  I'm so happy to be here.  Maine has made me fall in love with the AT all over again.Tomorrow we hike through Mahoosuc Notch, which is either the most difficult or most fun mile on the trail.  It is a mile of boulders the size of houses and cars that we must go over, under, or around to follow the white blazes.  I'm looking forward to it.","Success Trail

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576157,"Today we hiked three of the four hardest miles on the Appalachian Trail (we hiked the other at the end of yesterday's hike).  We hiked a total of 10.3 miles, and it took us 12 hours.  We started the day by hiking two miles up to reach the AT and then started into Mahoosuc Notch.  This is a jumble of boulders in between two mountains.  The blazes for the trail are painted on the rocks, and the hiker must go over, under, or around the boulders.  We crawled through three cave-like places.  I leaped over one gap that wasn't too far but had a 10-foot fall.  Randy, our newest guest hiker, said he gasped because I then tilted backward as though I were going to fall into the hole.  I am sticking to my plan to maintain as low a center of gravity as possible and to try to have three points of contact at all times.  This was a challenge and required great focus.  It took us three hours to get through the one mile of Mahoosuc Notch.  From there we headed up a mountain called Mahoosuc Arm.  This required a lot of climbing up rocks, which I enjoyed.  I'm getting the hang of using every part of my body to propel myself upward, and it's very satisfying.  It's slow though.  Although none of the individual climbs were too difficult, there was a huge number of them.  By the end of the day I was totally exhausted.  Tonight we're staying at a hostel called The Cabin, a very interesting place. The owners, Honey and Bear (trail names) have been taking in hikers since 1984, when they hiked from Springer Mountain to Clingmans Dome and started inviting people to stay at their cabin.  They have hosted Earl Shaffer, the first person to thru hike the trail (in 1948) and other hiking celebrities.  We're going to stay here as our base for three nights, so we don't have to pitch our tents or fix meals.  We arrived around 7:30, and Honey served us a wonderful homemade meal: roast beef, gravy, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, salad, dinner rolls, brownies, ice cream, and lemonade.  I ate heartily.  After eating I had a shower and got out clean clothes for tomorrow.  We're sleeping in till 6:00 tomorrow. Breakfast is at 7:00, and Warren will shuttle us back to the trail at 7:30.  We are hiking 10.3 miles that should be less difficult than the ones today.  I am so enjoying Maine.  It's beautiful and difficult but not life-threatening.","Mahoosuc Notch Trail

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576237,"Today was another beautiful day in Maine.  The group hiked over Baldpate Mountain.  The weather was cool and clear, the views spectacular.  From the top we could see mountain ranges in all directions, receding into blue in the distance.  Arlene, Bill, Graybeard, and I hiked south, while the rest of the group hiked north.  The hike up Baldpate was long and mostly gradual.  Near the top there was a long stretch of rock slabs to be crossed.  They were dry, and they were granite, which has a rough texture.  Consequently, they were not too difficult.  Even so, it was slow going.  Lizzie said her goal for the day was to go one mile an hour. Everyone managed to do that.  I'm very impressed with the way the Maine Appalachian Trail Club has maintained this section of the trail. There were bog bridges everywhere they were needed.  There were stair series in many places that were appropriate for us short people.  In one place there was a perfect stone path through the mud (see photo).  All the stones were flat, a rarity, and evenly spaced.  It was a pleasure to look at and to use.  A plant I didn't know was along many parts of the trail.  It had red berries.  I photographed it and asked the hostel folks what it was.  It turns out to be hobble bush viburnum.  The berries are edible, and they are eaten by moose.  (This is the plant that I saw immediately upon entering Vermont but didn't know.)It's nice to be staying at a hostel rather than camping.  Honey, the wife of the couple, took a bus to the top of Mount Washington, hiked down to Lakes of the Clouds, and hiked back up to celebrate her 85th birthday.On another note, Lizzie has taken a trail name, What Hill?, Jr.  it comes from her dad's always saying ""What hill?"" when they ran together.  I had tried to name her MG because she's small and fast like a little red sports car, also agile like a mountain goat, but she didn't accept it.I haven't fallen in two days, but tonight I gashed my arm on a door mechanism, tearing a small rectangular flap.  Lizzie has given me some of her cleaning supplies and wound medication to take care of it.  Warren has suggested that I skip the six days of hiking that I've already done.  I hope not to do that.  The dates of those hikes are outside the 12-month period for my thru hike, and so would convert this to a section hike.  Having come this far, I want to complete a thru hike.  Also, that part of Maine is very beautiful.  Tomorrow we have another short but difficult hike."," East B Hill Rd., Andover, ME (southbound)

Although we were not pulling ourselves up with our arms, it was still very hard.  In the first hour we hiked 1.3 miles, which was not bad for the terrain.  Then Arlene and I came across Bill sitting on a rock trying to figure out how to use Guthook.  We spent about 15 minutes there and ate some snacks.  We continued on with Bill in tow.  Soon he decided to stop to eat again.  At the top of the first mountain we stopped for lunch.  By the time I left it was 1:38, and we'd just gone four miles.  As we started at 8:00, this was less than one mile an hour.  I began to panic.  At this rate we wouldn't get in till 7:00.

Yesterday Terri wrote in her journal about the power of imagination to create and exaggerate hard places in the trail.  One of the scary places she had imagined was a place with a large slanted slab of granite that I had described as really frightening.  Last year I stood a long time at the top of this place before deciding to sit down, spread my arms and legs wide, and gradually let myself down.  I thought yesterday's section was the one with this place and was waiting to arrive at this place.  I never did.  Looking back, I recall a slanted slab, but it was apparent to me that the best way to get down was to go down the steeper but smaller rocks on the left.  The place is still there, but having hiked 2,000 miles in the interim I'm no longer the same hiker.
My sister/editor Diane says my journals have had a sequence of themes: first how cold I was, then how hungry I was, then how tired I am.  Now it seems I'm headed back to the theme of being too cold.  
We passed the 2,000 mile mark today.  We now have less than 200 miles left to go.  Two weeks from today we'll be climbing Mount Katahdin.  It's hard to believe the journey is coming to an end.Note to Readers: Several readers were disappointed there was no picture of my sequined Wonder Woman patch.  I have now changed the photo of one day to show the patch.  You can always find more pictures by clicking on the Photos tab to the left of the entry.  Each day I post four or five photos, but the Trailjournals format only allows one picture to appear with each journal entry.  There are lots more photos in the Photos section.","Caribou Valley Road

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576899,"We had a cozy night at Stratton Motel/Hostel.  Instead of camping out in the wind and cold, we had two rooms at the hostel, which is an old motel.  I shared a room with Terri; Jeff Emmons, a guest hiker, slept on our floor.  We got up at 4:30 to be picked up at 5:30.  I was on the trail by 5:45.We had a hard hike across the Bigelow range.  We crossed South Horn (elev. 3831), Bigelow West Peak (elev. 4245), Avery Peak (elev. 4090), and Little Bigelow (elev. 4010).  There were a lot of ups and downs, much of it rocky or rooty.  It took me 13 hours to hike 16.8 miles, and that's with only the shortest of breaks. I hiked the second half with Lizzie, which made me go faster.  I'm completely wiped out and find it hard not to doze off while writing.  Warren says this is the last of the very difficult days, for which I'm grateful.  He says the next days will be much less wear and tear on our bodies.  Tomorrow we hike 16.6 miles, and there are no mountains.  Author's Note:  I was so worn out last night that I neglected to write the highlight of the day: the view from Bigelow West Peak was the most spectacular view of the entire hike. At the top, which was rocky, there were 360-degree views of range upon range of mountains.  To the left lay (west, by AT convention, even though it might not be compass west), Flagstaff Lake with all its wooded islands.  To the right were views of valleys, more mountains, an airstrip.  Straight ahead was the rounded shape of Avery Peak and, farther ahead, the oblong shape of Little Bigelow, the next mountains to be climbed.  Behind we saw the mountain we'd just crossed, South Horn.  I tried but failed to take a panoramic photograph.  I would like to have stayed a while, but the peak was crowded (it being Saturday) and the wind was quite strong and cold.","ME 27, Stratton

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576900,"Today we didn't cross any mountains.  It was cold when we woke.  Rain was predicted to start around 4:00 PM, so we all hurried to reach the endpoint before the rain started.  The trail followed the shoreline of Flagstaff Lake for a few miles.  I stopped at one beach just to enjoy the quiet of the morning.   Someone had collected driftwood and used it to construct a clamshell-shaped shelter.  Very interesting and enticing. The trail wandered up and down small hills (nothing steep), through several large bogs, and over rocks and roots.  However, there were several places where the trail was an actual dirt path covered with evergreen needles.   We passed East Carry Pond and West Carry Pond.  The names come from a historical incident in 1775, when Colonel Benedict Arnold led an army of about 1000 to capture Quebec.  The group passed through this area and used these ponds as part of the portage of their boats from the Kennebec River to the Dead River.  The route of the AT between the two ponds precisely follows their path, according to the historical marker.  About six miles from our endpoint the trail crossed a sandy beach on East Carry Pond. Last year when I was here I was hiking with two faster hikers, and we blasted right by without stopping.  I was determined to stop for at least a few minutes this year to enjoy the place.  It would have been a nice place to swim, but it was only 55 today.  (Last year, hiking a week earlier, it was 80).  I sat down on a rock and got out my chocolate mint cookies and my can of Starbucks espresso and cream.  While I was eating the wind came up, and I put on my hat and a heavyweight fleece.  I felt the temperature of the sand with my hand, but it wasn't warm enough for me to take off my shoes.  After this break I took off at high speed.  Arlene and I finished hiking at 3:15 and were able to get our tents up before the rain started.  We all got into the van and packed our food for tomorrow from inside the van.  Then Arlene, Lizzie, Terri, and I killed some time waiting for our phones to charge.  It's so rare that we have any free time, and we spent it laughing and joking.  There are a lot of moose droppings where we set up our tents, so we teased Arlene about what we all would do if a moose stops by to poop on her tent.  (My role is to take the picture).  Sometimes in this group I have a feeling of freshman year in college in the women's dorm - lots of free-ranging discussion and laughing, with no topic off limits.  Since we had all this spare time I rummaged around in my Miscellaneous bin and found the little book of Thoreau essays that my friend Donna sent.  I'd like to read the one on Katahdin before we climb it.  We've had so little free time I'd about given up hope that I could do it though.  It feels good having some down time.Tomorrow we cross the Kennebec in the canoe ferry.  This is the official white-blazed part of the trail.  Warren disdains this and has taken two guest hikers, Bobby Joe Smith and Jeff Emmons, to set up to stealth ford it early tomorrow.  Despite Warren's pressure to ford on foot, all of the Expedition members are taking the ferry.  Because the ferry doesn't start until 9:00 AM and it's only 3.2 miles away, we can sleep in and not leave until 7:00.","East Flagstaff Road

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576961,"We camped last night in a moose privy.  There were about a dozen piles of moose droppings, and we hoped we'd see a moose.  No such luck.  Arlene and Lizzie heard a loud crash in the middle of the night.  Arlene immediately suspected a moose, but it was just a large tree limb falling (fortunately not near us).  
It had stopped raining by the time we got up, but somehow the foot of my sleeping bag got wet.  It's gotten damp from condensation before, but this time it was quite wet.  I put it about halfway into its stuff sack and left the wet end out to dry on the box in the van.  When I got in tonight it was dry.  
The hike was pleasant.  We got to the Kennebec River a few minutes after 9:00, the time the canoe ferry starts service.  Rennie and Grey Beard were the first passengers to cross.  There is a white blaze in the bottom of the canoe, indicating that the ferry canoe is the official trail.  
It was a pretty but variable day.  To the right the sky was full of dark threatening clouds; to the left the sky was blue and sunny.  All of the Expedition members took the ferry.  As planned, Bobby Joe and Jeff E forded.  The water came above Bobby Joe's chest, which means it would have been up to my neck.  I would have to have swum.  No thanks.  
The mountain of the day was Pleasant Pond Mountain (elev. 2570).  The ascent was mostly gradual, with a mile of steeper terrain near the top.  I reached there about 2:00 and sat in a place sheltered from the wind to have my chocolate mint cookies and espresso.  I discovered I had cell service and took the opportunity to send my pictures and journal entries for the past two days.  
The woods we passed through were pretty.  In places everything was moss covered, making scenes of intense green, almost like a rain forest.  We're no longer crossing granite stones, which have a coarse textured surface that is easy to grip.  The replacement is slate, which is very slippery when wet.  As it had rained last night we had to be very careful on these rocks and on the tree roots.   
Wildlife sightings:  Today I saw a small creature dart quickly then stop.  It was a small golden tan creature that looked just like a field mouse.  I later talked to a Mainer who confirmed that it was a mouse.  I didn't recognize it because the mice in West Virginia are gray.  Lizzie and Rennie both saw red-spotted efts, which we haven't seen since Vermont.  Terri and I saw a small garter snake, the farthest north we've seen any snakes.  Two days ago Rennie and Bobby Joe saw a moose.  The rest of us are still looking and hoping.  
We are camped tonight in some nice woods at a trailhead.  The moon is orange and full or nearly full.  I feel grateful to be out here poised to complete the trail.  As of today we have 139.3 miles left to hike.  There is a palpable feeling of excitement in the group.  We're really going to do it!  Tonight Rennie told us that all the women are doing excellent work and he's proud of us.  This is quite a compliment coming from him.  At the beginning of the hike I think he regarded most women as decorative but not very competent.  When I first injured my wrist but didn't yet know it was broken he chided me for asking for help putting on my pack and poncho.  His attitude, at least toward us, has definitely changed.
Tomorrow we're fording the east and west branches of the Piscataquis River, the river that runs through Dover-Foxcroft.  This is the town where I spent my formative years (ages 5 to 13).  Although I no longer have ties there, I still have a special fondness for it."," Road past Pierce Pond

Later Lizzie caught up.  The four of us hiked the rest of the day together.  We spent much of the afternoon walking alongside the western branch of the Piscataquis River.  It was full of slate boulders and was quite fast running in places.  At one place there were tall cliffs on the other side. At the fording place, I took my socks off and waded across in my hiking shoes.  After I was across I put my dry wool socks back on.  They kept my feet warm and absorbed a lot of the water from the shoes.  The ford of the East Branch was much easier.  We managed to cross on stones and a beaver dam. Tonight we're settled into beds in a bunk room at Shaws hostel in Monson after having a wonderful dinner at the Lakeshore House Dining and Lodging.  I had scallops in a white wine sauce, rice, salad, four-berry cobbler, and two beers.  It's nice to be sleeping indoors on a very rainy night."," Moxie Pond

We started hiking late so that we could eat breakfast first.  We ate a huge breakfast.  The blueberry pancakes were great, but they were served with fake maple syrup.  I consider this a sin in a state that produces a lot of real maple syrup.  It wasn't raining when we started, but water was dripping off the trees from all the rain overnight.  I decided to wear my rain jacket, which isn't really waterproof, until the rain started, then switch to my poncho, which is more waterproof but sometimes too hot.  I never realized when the rain actually started, so I was drenched to the skin before I realized it was raining.  Bill remarked it was too bad we didn't have cell service: he could have called me to let me know it was raining.  It was a quick hike.  We started at 8:30 and finished by 11:00.  Warren then took us to Greenville to get groceries.  I got very chilled in the grocery store until I discovered I could buy hot coffee.  When we got back to the hostel we headed downtown to get lunch at Pete's Place, a really nice bakery.  I had an excellent grilled cheese sandwich made with oat bread and Swiss cheese.  Bill, Arlene, Terri, and I hung out there for quite a while relaxing and talking.  I ordered a peach split made with a one scoop each of blueberry, strawberry, and black raspberry ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and peanuts on top.  Bill, Arlene, and I shared it, then ordered and ate another one.Later we all got showers and did our laundry.  I got on a scale for the first time since Harpers Ferry and discovered I weigh 110 pounds.  I'm very bony and no longer have much fat, but I'm also muscular, dense, and strong.  So I'm not going to worry that I don't weigh much.  We're now fortified and ready for our last nine days of hiking.  At the end of tomorrow's hike we'll have less than 100 miles to go.  Mileage note: We actually hiked 6.3 miles today, but somehow the mileage count is short by .3.  We've finished 2075.3 miles and have 114.5 left to hike.","Shirley-Blanchard Rd., Monson

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577862,"Today I had several opportunities to be seriously injured or killed, but I managed to fend them off.  Just barely.  It rained steadily all day yesterday, overnight, and this morning, greatly increasing the water flow in the streams we had to cross.  In normal conditions we would have had two streams to ford.  Today we had five.  The first was not more than halfway to my knee, and the current was not very strong.  I tried to arrange my backpack to minimize the risk of getting things wet and carefully picked my way across. The second was another story entirely.  It was deeper, up to my crotch, and running very fast.  Lizzie and I scoped it out, and I went first.  There was a place where a rope had formerly been fixed; there was another place directly across from the trail on the other side.  I picked the second spot and set off.  Once I got to the deeper water it was very hard to keep my footing.  After several near falls I finally lost my balance and fell in.  I tried to get up but couldn't and was swept downstream.  Not being able to control where I was going was frightening.  But I remembered what I'd been told about getting caught in a riptide: swim diagonally across the current.  I aimed my feet so the current would take me diagonally toward the other shore farther downstream.  I eventually was able to grab a rock and pull myself back upright. From there I was able to walk to the other side.All my clothing and just about everything in my pack was soaked. My phone, in its Lifeproof case, was fine.  The sun came out momentarily, and I stripped down to my underwear.  Lizzie had a dry pair of sweatpants, and I had a dry fleece that I put on.  We continued on.  The next to last ford was at a waterfall that was raging.  It was a really dangerous long chute with lots of rocks.  A southbound hiker had told us that he went upstream three ledges to find an easier place to cross.  We decided to do that, too, as the water was quite deep at the falls.  We started upstream, and I slipped and fell in twice just trying to get to the easier place to ford. At one point I need to pull myself up onto a rock, but I couldn't because I was so wet that I made the rock slippery.  Somehow we finally made it to the third ledge.  Her the river was much wider and calmer.   Once we started across I was fine.  The last ford had a rope to hold onto, and this was definitely helpful.  The water was very cold at all of these streams, but I was so focused on getting across safely that I only noticed once I was out.  After the last ford we hiked .3 off the trail to get to our meeting place with the van.  It took me some time to take everything out of my pack to repack into my bigger backpack (the one I'd used while backpacking in the Smokies). While I was doing this and packing my lunch for tomorrow, a man drove up to kick us off his land.  He does not allow camping.  Somehow Warren talked him into letting us stay, but the encounter was distinctly unpleasant.   Tomorrow we have a day that Warren characterizes as difficult.  I hope it's not as dangerous as today.  Crossing these streams when the water is so high is solely a function of our hiking on a schedule: Absent the schedule I'd just wait a day for the water to go down before fording.  My friend Morph has suggested that I take the remaining days of the hike in the 100 Mile Wilderness to meditate on all the things I've been through on the hike.  It's a good idea, and I'm going to give it a try.  I know that as soon as I reach Katahdin life will become a whirlwind of activity that will preclude such thinking.  I'm going to turn off my phone for the rest of the hike.  (This is somewhat theoretical, since I don't have service anyway.)","ME 15, Monson

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577880,"Today was short but full of hard work.  We started by fording the West Branch of the Pleasant River.  Unlike the other streams we've crossed recently, this one was shallow (not deeper than mid-shin), with not much current.  My shoes haven't dried out from the fording we did two days ago, so I just slogged through in my socks and hiking shoes.   The water was cold, and my feet stayed cold for a long time.  Bill forded in Crocs.  Arlene forded barefoot in order to avoid another day of wet feet.  Partway across she realized what a bad move this was: if she cut her foot on a rock her hike might end - less than 100 miles from the end.  Not far into the hike we came to a sign that Katahdin is 83.9 miles away.  We stopped to pose at the sign (see photo).  We continue to be amazed at how close we're getting.  This project that we started more than four months ago is nearing completion.The rest of the hike was a long ascent, followed by several more short climbs and descents.  We crossed Gulf Hagas Mountain (elev. 2681), West Peak (elev. 3178), Hay Mountain (elev. 3244), and Whitecap Mountain (elev. 3650).  There were magnificent views facing north and south from Whitecap.  Looking north we saw Katahdin.  The space in front of it was engulfed in a rainstorm, and the light made it look like a rainbow.  Atop one of these we saw huge amounts of moose droppings.  In one place they covered a place about twelve feet wide (see photo).  Our hopes rose that we might see a moose, but we didn't.  We stopped at the next clearing to eat a quick lunch, and Chops came through.  He was very excited - he'd just seen a moose.  He said the moose was walking on the trail.  ""There wasn't enough room for both of us on the trail, so I stepped off.  The moose looked at me and walked on.  Then it turned to look at me again."" We decided that we were making too much noise to see a moose. So for a while we continued on in complete silence.  Still no moose.  Arlene, Bill, Lizzie, and I hiked together most of the day.  It was nice to have all four of us together.  Lizzie and I took off ahead of them from Whitecap and then started rushing because we heard thunder that sounded close.  It rained sporadically but not very hard.  Lizzie and I got in at 5:00, and Arlene and Bill arrived about 15 minutes later.My shoes are still drenched tonight.  I slipped on a rock crossing a stream and completely submerged both feet again.  I'll put on dry socks tomorrow to start the day, but there's another ford just a few miles in.  Depending on how it looks, I may try fording in Crocs.  My long-sleeved shirt and lightweight fleece are still wet from falling into the water two days ago.  I hung the fleece on the back of my pack today, and it dried some.  But it'll take another day for it to be fully dry.  I've given up on the socks and will just throw them in the dirty laundry bag, even though they will mildew in there.  One of the pleasures of civilization I'm looking forward to is being able to start each day in dry clothes.","Katahdin Ironworks Road

We stopped to talk with him and Crayola's dad and had beer and snacks.  Next we found nice camping spots nearby and set up our tents. When we got back to the parking lot to pack our food, Warren had taken everything out of the van and thrown it on the ground.  He said that since we got in so early we could use the time consolidating all our stuff so we wouldn't have to do it at the end. We spent the time we'd hoped to relax organizing all our miscellaneous stuff.  I asked Warren about the schedule for the last several days, specifically about Wednesday.  The schedule shows that day hikers do 18.5 miles, and backpackers do 4.5 miles that day and 13.4 the next.  His response was, ""Everyone will hike 18.5.  The other schedule was for people who like the out of doors, which this group isn't.""  It often seems he goes out of his way to belittle and offend us.  I'm really tired of it.  It's now 6:45, and I hope to be able to retire to my tent and read for a while.  Tomorrow we hike 15.2 miles of what appears to be flat trail.  I hope we don't finish too early.","West Branch Ponds Rd.

Arlene had cell service, so we were able to look up the berry-bearing  bush we saw at the first beach.  It turned out to be elderberry, the first I've seen.  About two miles past that we came to another wide sandy beach. We basked on a driftwood log there until we got almost hot.  Bill decided to swim, and I decided to wade.  The water felt so good though that I changed my mind about swimming.  I took off all my clothes and waded into the water.  Before I got completely submerged Rennie and Bobby Joe, our southbound hikers, came by.  The water was cold so I didn't stay in long - just long enough to get my hair thoroughly wet.  I felt clean and totally refreshed when I got out.  When I got dressed I zipped off the legs of my pants so that I was in shorts and a t-shirt.  This felt wonderful after weeks of bundling up in so many layers of clothing.  We ate lunch.

We managed to draw the day out to a one mile an hour pace by sightseeing at every pretty spot along the way.  The AT follows the shoreline of Nahmakanta Lake for quite a ways.  Our first stop was at a gravel beach not far from where we started.  The sun was shining brightly.  Bill, Arlene, Lizzie, and I sat down on rocks, basked in the sun, and ate our first snacks of the day.  Not far past this beach was another beach, this one large and sandy.  We sat down at a picnic table and had more snacks.  There were some beach chairs, and Arlene settled into one in the shade.  There was a canoe there available for public use.  Bill, Lizzie, and I took it out for a short ride.  We saw five ducks with red heads swimming near us.  We stayed there for 45 minutes or an hour enjoying the sun and warmth.  The one mountain of the day was Nesuntabunt, which is only 1520 feet in elevation.  We stopped at a side trail there to see a view of Mount Katahdin, just 16 miles in the distance.  There I got cell phone service and called Diane.  There have been complications in my plans to get home, so I wanted her help in exploring options.  We ate lunch here.  My last stop of the day was at a rock slab that formed a sort of beach at the west end of Crescent Pond (see photo above).  I sat and ate the last of my snacks for the day.  I left when the wind started cooling the place.  I've been reading Henry David Thoreau's essay on climbing Mount Katahdin.  His trip was on September 9, and he noticed (and ate) a lot of blueberries and mooseberries.  I've been wondering what mooseberries are. This morning it came to me: they are the berries of the hobblebush viburnum, which we've been told are a favorite of moose.  I'm finishing this entry shortly after 8:00, so I should have time to finish reading the essay tonight.  Tomorrow we hike the final part of the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  It's 18.1 miles, and we're highly motivated to finish before 7:00 PM.  There are showers at the campground at Abol Bridge, and we'd love to get clean.  There might also be a restaurant where we could get real food.  Out here we live like animals.  Our biggest thoughts are of keeping warm, getting food, and getting clean.","Nahmakanta Lake

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577889,"We walked out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness this afternoon shortly after four o'clock.  The road we came to had a campground, store, and restaurant about .3 mile away.  We dropped our packs, gathered our shower gear and clean clothes, and headed to the campground to get showers.  On the way we ran into The Patriot, who was again doing trail magic.  This time he was set up in a tent with chairs.  We sat down and had beer and potato chips and talked to the Patriot and Crayola's dad.  Then we headed to the campground.  Taking a shower at the campground cost $5.00 for people not staying there.  It was worth that and more.  I felt amazingly clean afterwards.   There are no words to express just how grimy we are after eight days of hiking.  We do vigorous physical exercise 10 or 12 hours each day, touch trees and dirt constantly, and occasionally spray ourselves with bug spray.  We actually have to scrub ourselves to get the dirt off.  (In Kent, Connecticut I used a white washcloth, and the cloth turned brown with each swipe.)Today also had an element of the sublime.  We just spent two hours on Abol Bridge looking toward Katahdin for Northern lights.  Several photographers were set up there because apparently conditions were right for them to appear.  We didn't see any, but we got a clear view of the Milky Way.  Today's hike took us past many parts of Rainbow Lake.  We made a few stops along the way to enjoy the sights, and we had a relaxing lunch at Rainbow Ledges.  I saw a beautiful green frog (see photo), and we heard a coyote howling and loons calling.  It was a sunny, pleasant day again - another summery day.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  
Tonight is our last night tenting.  Tomorrow we hike 10 miles into Baxter State Park, where we will camp at two four-person lean-tos.  We have only 15.4 miles left to get to the top of Katahdin and finish the Appalachian Trail.  I can't quite believe it.","Pollywog Stream

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577890,"We're sitting at a picnic table at Katahdin Stream Campground watching our fire - the first campfire we've had.  Katahdin Stream is babbling beside us.  This is our last night together, and we're in a lovely place after spending an excellent day hiking together.  Earlier we went to the warden's office and got our permits to hike up Katahdin.  I am number 804 for northbound thru hikers (I was 1309 at Harpers Ferry).  It's hard to believe that in 5.2 more miles we'll be done.  The trail ends at Baxter Peak.  After that we'll still have to come down some steep and scary places.  I've read that this is the most difficult section of the whole trail.  Grey Beard, who's already hiked it, said that it's no worse than lots of places in the White Mountains.The trail today started in a beautiful birch forest (see photo) and followed the West Branch of the Penobscot River for several miles.  Lizzie and I stopped at a beautiful cascade to wade.  We spent a long time there picking up small stones made smooth by the action of the rushing water.  While we were there Arlene and Bill caught up.  Bill waded for a while and then stretched out on a rock in the sun.  We stayed there quite a while and ate lunch.  Later we took another long break at Little Niagara Falls (see photo).  We walked by rivers and ponds all day.  At one stream a group of Americorps workers were building a bridge over a stream, and I stopped briefly to take a picture (see photo).  The weather continues to be warm and sunny.  The thermometer on my pack read 80 degrees at one point.  We even heard cicadas.  I so enjoy this.  Tomorrow's forecast is for more sunny warm weather for our climb up Katahdin.","Abol Stream

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577892,"We were up early on our big day and on the trail by 5:50.  When we woke we found Warren asleep on the ground near our lean-tos.  He had been planning to go up Katahdin with us but changed his mind at the last minute.  This was a relief for the group: we were concerned that he wouldn't be able to make it up and back. At least two of the hikes he did with us he cut short and had to be picked up at road crossings before the endpoint.  There is nowhere to bail out on Katahdin, and a rescue is a very big deal.  (A sign on the trail said rescue may take as long as 24 hours.)The first part of the hike was nice trail, uphill but not too rocky or rooty.  However, there was a long section that was constant rock climbing.  I've gotten pretty good at this and have learned to use all of my muscles - legs particularly - to hold myself in position to make a move.  In places, small pieces of rebar were strategically affixed to rocks to serve as hand- or footholds.  I could not have gotten up without these. I am five feet, five inches tall, and my hands and legs simply can't reach far enough to get up these places.  This part was difficult but fun and, in places, scary. The next section was a long rocky ridge uphill, above treeline, without much actual rock scrambling or climbing.  This lasted about one mile.  Finally we crossed into the Tablelands, a place that looked like a moonscape and was less steep.  A large open space was littered with low boulders. Between the boulders low, mostly red-leafed, plants grew, with an occasional short yellow-leafed plant.  This was a starkly beautiful landscape.  I took many photos, but none captures the exotic feel of the place. Finally we reached the top - Baxter Peak.  The Expedition members and guests who had finished ahead of us greeted us with hugs.  I even got a big hug from Rennie, who just shook my hand after we finished the Whites.  There were a lot of people at the top - probably 20 other thru hikers and 15 day hikers.  We ate our lunches and took group and individual pictures on top of the famous sign.  We arrived around 12:30 and left about an hour later.  It was way too crowded to spend much time there.   Before we left I spent a private moment at the large cairn on the peak.  Many years ago I promised my dad that after he and Mother were both dead I'd mix their ashes together and scatter them at Sebec Lake.  They both considered the years they lived in Maine some of the happiest of their lives.  With this in mind and their love of mountains, I took a small amount of their mingled ashes and left them near the cairn on top of Baxter Peak.  I was numb at the sign at the peak on finishing the trail, but leaving their ashes there made me cry.  We took the Abol trail back down the mountain.  It's a bit shorter than the AT trail (Hunt), but it has a very steep section.  It had been closed because of a rock slide but was newly redone and reopened.  The ranger told us that the steep section was about three-quarters of a mile long.  Well.  The downhill section was extremely steep and treacherous - a rocky descent.  We had to carefully plan each step, just as we had coming up, only it was more dangerous going downhill.  Also, because the trail is newly made it's covered with scree about the size of cat litter.  I slipped on this and fell twice on the way down.  We made no stops going down, and it took forever to get past the steep rocky part.  It took us three and a half hours to go a bit more than four miles.Once we were past the rocks I noticed a sharp pain on the top of my right foot. Several times in the past few days I've experienced this pain when I've twisted my foot a certain way on rocks.  It happened once on the way up the mountain.  And occasionally at night in bed I've had an excruciating sharp pain in one of my toes.  Now the pain was constant.  I'm not sure whether it got worse or whether I just started to notice it when I could ease up my focus on the rocks. I took some ibuprofen and limped to the end of Abol trail.  I discovered that I could alleviate the pain somewhat by walking with that foot flat-footed and not bending it at all.  Bill, Arlene, Rennie, and I have completed our hikes.  Lizzy has a 331-mile section left to do from when she was home with her injured knee.  Terri has about 500 miles left to do from when she was home with her injured knee.  Guest hiker Bobby Joe also has several hundred miles left to do.  He's headed south to meet up with Grey Beard to finish his remaining miles.  Grey Beard has about 500 miles left to go.We had some blueberry pie and soft drinks, then headed to Millinocket for a last dinner together.  Afterwards we went our separate ways.  Terri left with her husband Reid and her son Scott (who hiked up the mountain with her).  Bobby Joe left to take Rennie to Bangor for a flight home.   Bill has agreed to drive the van back to Tennessee for Warren, and I'm riding along with him.  Lizzie and Arlene are headed to Lizzie's family cabin in New Hampshire and will ride along with us to Gorham, NH tomorrow.  It seems strange that my long walk is over.  I'm both happy and relieved: for the last few weeks I've walked on eggshells for fear of injuring myself and being unable to finish.  I can now go back to treating my body with ordinary care rather than as a potentially breakable vessel.  Note to readers: Please take the time to look at the photos of the hike up Katahdin.  It's an impressively difficult piece of trail, and we managed to get some good photos of most of our group climbing.  I still have some leftover subjects I planned to write about.  I hope to do a few more entries on these topics and on my reentry to posthike life in the next few days.  I'm curious to know who followed my journal.  If you are one of these people please hit the button to sign my guestbook.  And a million thanks to all of you who signed the guest book and sent words of encouragement.  You will never know how much this helped in the difficult parts of the hike."," Katahdin Stream Campground

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578235,"My transition to post-hike life has had a complication: I have a broken right foot.  I’ve gone from walking all day to walking only short distances with crutches and not driving at all.  This is not how I hoped things would be when I got home; however, it gives me an excuse to do some intense resting.    And I am very tired.  
After our final group dinner, Bill, Arlene, Lizzie, and I got a hotel room in Millinocket.  In the morning we stopped for coffee at Dunkin Donuts before getting on the road.  There Lizzie looked under the van and discovered that the muffler wasn’t connected to the exhaust system.  Several days earlier it had come loose, and Warren had wired it up with a coat hanger.  Apparently he just wired it up so that it wouldn’t fall off but didn’t reconnect it to the exhaust system.  We headed out with all the windows rolled down so as to avoid gassing ourselves with carbon monoxide.    
The first sizable town we came to was Dover-Foxcroft, the town where I lived from ages 5 to 13.  We tried several places to get the muffler repaired, but it was Saturday morning and places were about to close for the weekend.  Finally we stopped at an auto parts store.  We bought some pipe and clamps, and Bill used them to reconnect the muffler to the exhaust pipe.  The auto parts store folks were very helpful and lent him all the tools he needed.  (One had grown up near where I live in West Virginia and moved to Dover, while I started out in Dover and ended up near where he lived in West Virginia.)  While Bill was working, Lizzie and I walked toward downtown.  It felt very strange to be in my old hometown without having human connections there.  We didn’t walk far because my foot hurt too much to do much walking.  We bought sandwiches and chips at the grocery store so we wouldn’t have to stop for lunch.  By the time we were back on the road it was already noon. 
It was a sunny, beautiful day, and we enjoyed the ride across Maine.  The maples were turning red, but most of the other color changes had not yet begun.  We were to meet Lizzie’s dad in Gorham, New Hampshire, and we got there right on time at 3:30.  We’d been fantasizing about having ice cream at the little ice cream stand beside the moose statue, but it was closed.  So we went to a convenience store and got ice cream there.  It was an odd experience going into a convenience store and not being obligated to buy high-calorie snacks.  I realized I was now free to just buy a cup of coffee and leave.   My first step into post-hike eating - no more force feeding myself.  (At the breakfast in the hotel that morning I realized that I now can go back to picking one thing to eat instead of taking one of everything.)
We loaded all of Lizzie’s and Arlene’s bins and gear into Lizzie’s dad’s car and said goodbye.  I cried saying goodbye to Arlene.  Lizzie will likely end up in Asheville, NC, which is within easy driving distance, but Arlene is headed home to southern California, a long way from my home.  She’s facing some difficult problems, and I feel bad that I won’t be there to provide moral support.  Bill and I continued on, making a short stop in Hanover, New Hampshire.  We had planned to get to Waterford, Connecticut that night to visit some friends of his, but we only made it as far as Brattleboro, Vermont.  
The next day, we arrived in Waterford at 11:00 AM, planning to leave at 2:00.  We went out for lunch, and Bill’s friends took us on a driving tour of Waterford’s downtown and waterfront on the Thames River.  It was 2:00 when we got back to their house. Bill wanted to spend more time with his friends.  I was overtaken by a strong need to sleep.  I laid down and napped, and we didn’t get on the road till 5:00.  Several hours into the drive, in New York, the transmission started slipping (which it’s been doing all summer).  Then we heard a screeching noise and smelled something burning.  We pulled into a rest area for Bill to look under the hood.  When he was done, the van wouldn’t start.  We called AAA and Warren and decided to sleep in the van for the night.  When I got back from brushing my teeth, the van was running.  We went to the next exit and got a hotel room for the night.  
In the morning Warren came and traded vehicles with us.  He had been hiking in New York and was not far away.  Bill and I headed out in the red van.  We got to Abingdon, Virginia a bit before 11:00 PM, where Bill’s girlfriend was waiting for him.  In the morning we delivered the red van to Warren’s house and headed home.  Bill and Jan live in Portsmouth, Ohio, so it was only about half an hour out of their way to travel by way of West Virginia.  They dropped me off at my house around 3:30.  
The next day, Wednesday, I went to Med Express to get my foot x-rayed.  It was still very swollen and sore.  The x-rays showed a physeal (growth plate) fracture of the third metatarsal of the right foot.  That’s the long bone that connects the hind bones of the foot to the phalanges of the toes.  The doctor put a splint on it, gave me crutches, told me not to drive, and referred me to an orthopedist.  Looking back, I can see that this injury was in the works for a while.  For probably the last month of the hike I occasionally had a breathtakingly sharp pain when my foot twisted a certain way on rocks.  The pain was bad, but it usually went away after a minute or two.  And it was infrequent, maybe twice a week.   Occasionally I had a similarly excruciating pain in that toe in bed.  Coming down Katahdin after finishing the hike, we came down a large, steep boulder field.  On one rock that was high, I had to let myself jump two or three feet after letting myself down with my arms as far as I could reach.  I landed quite hard on both feet.  I now think this is what finally pushed the injury over the edge into a full-blown fracture.  I’ll see an orthopedist either today or Monday and will know more then.  
My sister Diane and her husband Dave are coming to visit today and will stay for a week.  The plan was for us to hang out and them to pamper me.  The pampering will be a lot heavier duty now that I can’t drive.  My friend Morph advised me to do nothing but rest for two weeks.  It looks like I have no other option.",,Home,"Sep 22, Fri",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578884,"I’ve now been home nearly two weeks, and I’m still adjusting to post-hike life.  It took Bill and me four days to drive home from Millinocket.  The changes started before we even got in the car.  
Eating: The day after we finished, I began reverting to my healthy pre-hike eating habits.  At the hotel’s breakfast bar, I poured juice and and coffee and selected one thing to eat, cold cereal.  During the hike, I would have eaten one of each food on the bar: juice, waffle, eggs, bacon, fruit, cereal, etc.  Next we went into Dunkin Donuts to get coffee, and I realized I now one have a one-donut limit.  But since I’d already eaten breakfast and wasn’t hungry, I didn’t get a donut at all.  
Further on, we went into a convenience store.  I wanted a soft drink.  All summer I’ve been drinking full-sugar drinks - think, real Coke — amazingly refreshing when you’re hot from hiking.  I reverted to Diet Coke.  I took the first sip and could only taste chemicals, very nasty.  When I got home I wanted a cold drink, and Diet Coke was the only thing in my refrigerator.  I opened one, and it tasted totally normal, not full of chemicals.  I can only attribute this change to my brain realizing that I’m now home and this is what I drink in my non-hiking life.  How amazing the brain is to make this transition!  
Changes to my appetite happened almost immediately.  The first day after the hike I got hungry every two hours, just as I would on the trail.  But the next day that phenomenon started to fade, and I now am hungry only at mealtimes.  There were some glitches. One night I woke at 3:00 AM ravenously hungry.  I no longer keep snacks in my pocket to eat the minute I get hungry.  
The cravings for fresh fruit and vegetables that I had on the trail have not disappeared.  Buying real tomatoes and fresh sweet corn at the farmers’ market gives me a feeling of wellbeing, and eating them makes me unreasonably happy.  I expect this to last for a while.  I’m really enjoying not having to rush through every meal.  On the trail I nearly always had to hurry to finish the miles for the day, so I had to eat very fast.  Now I can take my time and enjoy the food I eat.  And when I feel full I can stop eating, instead of forcing myself to eat more.  
Sleeping: On the trail I fell sleep as soon as I laid down and slept, mostly without interruption, until the alarm went off in the morning.  If I woke, I rolled over and went back to sleep.  I did not get up.  At home I wake more often, sometimes get up, and sometimes have trouble getting back to sleep.  Going from 12 hours a day of exercise to no exercise obviously has affected my sleeping patterns.  Even so, I sleep better now than before the hike.  I sleep till I wake up, not setting an alarm, about 8 or 9 hours a night.  
Living indoors/being home: Being home in my own house feels peaceful and wonderful.  It’s so clean and light-filled.  Showering whenever I want still feels truly luxurious, as does washing my hands in warm soap and water.  Having a toilet is great.  Sleeping in a bed is also nice. But I’m not as settled at home as I would have expected, mostly because of my broken foot.  I’ve only slept in my own bed once and showered in my own bathroom once.  
When I went to a doctor, the day after I got home, he put my broken foot in a splint, gave me crutches, and told me not to drive.  The splint precluded my showering.  Not knowing how long this would last, I moved clothing into the first floor bedroom and toiletries into the first floor bathroom.  I gave my sister Diane and her husband my bedroom and bathroom upstairs when they came to visit.   We spent last week doing my settling-in chores: cleaning my camping gear and putting it away, doing laundry, redirecting my mail, restarting the newspaper, getting groceries, dealing with my accumulated mail, getting enough library books to last me a while, and replacing my iPhone (which I smashed and drowned on the trail).  This was not restful.
On Tuesday I finally got to see an orthopedist.  The news there was all good.  The fracture is not displaced enough to require surgery.  I got a boot, rather than a cast.  I can walk, not overdoing it, of course; I can take the boot off to shower; and I can take it off to drive.  So I can now go back upstairs to sleep in my own bedroom, work in my quilt studio, and shower in my own bathroom.  And I won’t have to inconvenience my friends, who’ve already been doing errands for me for five months, by asking them to drive me around.
Reintegrating with friends:  I’m gradually catching up with my friends.  My book group had a welcome home dinner for me the day I got home.  Other friends have stopped by to say hello.  This weekend I’m staying with friends at their camp on the Greenbrier River.  (This has been very relaxing.  There’s nothing here that I’m tempted to jump up and do.  We’ve eaten good food, read, and gone to the Road Kill Cookoff in Marlinton.)  I’ll see my various quilt making buddies on Monday and Tuesday.  And another friend is having a welcome home party this upcoming Friday.  After that, things should quiet down — to the extent that they ever do.  
Photo of the day: The photo of the day is the work of Pam Bell.  Isn’t it nice?  Pam is one of my sister Diane’s quilting/art friends who I’ve come to know in my visits to Wisconsin.  She followed my journal faithfully (she was the one who asked Diane, “Is Charli crazy or stupid?”).  She mailed her artwork to me the day before I went up Katahdin based on Diane’s assurances that I really was going to finish.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579271,"Abrasions:  Three weeks after finishing my thru hike, my body is nearly healed.  The scabs have fallen off all the cuts and scrapes on my knees.  The large bruises on my right hip and leg have disappeared.  The u-shaped flap of skin that I tore on my right arm is now a faded small pink triangle.  The places that I skinned on my right elbow are healed, although there is still a large hard knot on the bone.  The two sores on my clavicle where the sternum strap fasteners hit are almost healed.  The calluses on my buttocks from sliding down rocks are gone.  My bruised tailbone is healed.  The sunburn on my arms and legs has faded and peeled.  
Feet and knees:  My knees still will not allow me to get into a full squatting position, but they’re better than they were and don’t hurt.  (They stopped hurting sometime after we got past the Pennsylvania rocks, except for on long downhills.)  The middle finger on my left hand, which I sprained in a fall, is not quite back to normal, but is close.  Both feet have large thick calluses on each side of the heel and on each side of the forefoot.  These don’t hurt and would be useful for hiking purposes, although dry and ugly, if I were going to hike soon.  
Broken wrist: Probably my only permanent souvenirs will come from my two broken bones, one in my left wrist and one in my right foot.  The wrist was immobilized in a cast for six weeks and in a splint for six weeks after that.  The splint was due to come off in Monson, eight days before the end of the hike, but I decided to protect the wrist a little longer.  I kept the splint on till I was down Katahdin at the end of the hike and left it off the next day.  The wrist hurts a bit several times a day and has lost some, but not much, range of motion.  The musculature of that forearm is still somewhat atrophied.  I will get some occupational therapy and do what the therapist tells me to do.  
Broken foot: My right foot has  been immobilized in a boot for a bit more than two weeks.  I will see the orthopedist after it’s been four weeks.  The foot has not hurt at all since I got the boot.  I continue to drink milk three times a day, as I have since I broke my wrist.
Overall: I am stronger and more aerobically fit than I have ever been in my life, although that is diminishing now that I’m not exercising 10 to 12 hours a day.  I have well-defined muscles in my arms, legs, abdomen, and buttocks.  I have ridges of muscle in my abdomen like those of men in ancient Greek statues, although mine aren’t as pronounced.  The day after the hike was over I was so tired I could hardly sit up to ride in the car.  For the first two weeks I felt like going to sleep every time I ate a meal.  I’m not quite so tired now, but I’m still sleeping 8 or 9 hours a night.  I’ve gained 3 pounds but seem to have stopped gaining weight.  Although I’m only 5 pounds lighter than my normal pre-hike weight, I’m much smaller than I was.  My body is more dense and compact.  All of my jeans and shorts are one size too big.  I’m starting to want to go for a walk or a bicycle ride. 
State of mind: I feel happy, relieved, and proud to have completed the hike.  I’ve definitely gotten the AT out of my system, but I’d like to do more long distance hiking.  When I first got home music was still playing in my head, but that has stopped.  I can summon music to mind, but it doesn’t come unbidden.  I no longer have crazy thoughts like my feet being named 105 and 106.  (That’s so strange I probably didn’t mention it before.)  I now have energy to read.  After experiencing so much kindness from so many people on the trail, I’m stunned by the amount of violence I see in the news every day.  Lots of public places like restaurants seem unpleasantly loud; however, driving a car seems totally normal.  Life seems to be returning to normal, but I’m not the same person I was when I started the hike.

Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580030,"On Thursday, October 26, my friend Dale Sanders/Grey Beard became the oldest person to thru hike the Appalachian Trail.  He is 82.  He started hiking in January, completing 100 miles before resuming hiking in April.  Along the way he met many hikers and hiked for various periods of time with different hikers and groups.  Our Expedition group met him at Mount Washington in New Hampshire.  He hiked with us from there to Monson, Maine.  He's a really good athlete, and I couldn't keep up with him for very long.  
Grey Beard planned to finish all but but the last mile of the trail by late October, have his family meet him in Harpers Ferry, rest for a day or so, then finish the last mile on Thursday, October 26.  He invited hikers who had hiked with him along the way to hike the last mile with him, and quite a few of those hikers took him up on his invitation.  Bill/Pilgrim Billbones and I drove to Harpers Ferry for the occasion.  Bobby Joe Smith, who hiked with our group for the last several hundred miles, came from Georgia.  Gene Anderson/Papa Bear, one of my earliest hiking friends, was also there.  They all hiked, while I waited at the ATC headquarters (because of my broken foot).  
Around 11:00 Greybeard reached the sidewalk in front of the ATC headquarters, where several television news crews and print reporters were waiting to film and interview him.  He gave a short speech thanking all who helped him along the way, particularly his wife Miriam.  At a low moment when he was thinking of going home she had told him he had to finish.  Then his wife and grandchildren posed with him for pictures.  Miriam gave a short speech about how all of us do small things, but together we can do big ones.  
Then the crowd headed indoors for refreshments.  Grey Beard disappeared into an office to give an interview to a reporter for the Washington Post. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2017/10/26/an-82-year-old-man-hiked-the-entire-appalachian-trail-then-he-danced-a-jig/?utm_term=.1abba36592f4.  The atmosphere was festive, and it was great to be surrounded by so many hikers.  
While I was waiting for Grey Beard to arrive I talked to several hikers and people who were thinking about hiking.  I met a woman from France who had just finished a week of hiking the trail.  She told me about the Tour de Mont Blanc, which has beautiful views every day and can be hiked from hut to hut, i.e., without carrying a heavy pack.  I met a couple just returned from 12 years in China and encouraged them to pursue their dream of thru hiking.  I talked to a woman in her early 60s who was concerned that hiking alone might be dangerous.  I so enjoyed being around so many people who share my interest in long-distance hiking.  
Bill and I left for home about one o'clock.  It was great to spend time catching up with him about how things are going with his re-entry into post-hike life.  We are going through many of the same thoughts and feelings.  Recently when he was facing several stressful and difficult decisions he yearned to go away to be alone in the woods for several days.  Then he realized, he had just spent four and a half months in the woods without being able to decide and realized that a few more days were probably not going to be the solution.  
Broken foot update: I've graduated from wearing a boot to wearing a post-op shoe. X-rays show the broken bone to be healing well.  In two weeks I can start transitioning from the post-op shoe to a sneaker.  I am not to engage in any athletic endeavors until six weeks after that.  I'm anxious to get back to the woods to hike before the weather turns cold, but I'm not going to rush things.  I hope to have more years of long-distance hiking ahead of me.",,View Entry,"Oct 28, Sat",0

“What if they tow the van?”  One day Warren parked the van, which contained all our tents, sleeping bags, food, spare hiking shoes, and the like on a paved country road in New York - right below a No Parking sign.  We knew when we set out for the day that the van was parked there.  Arlene worried that the van would be towed and impounded, leaving us without any camping gear or food.  In Southern California, where she lives, towing is standard operating procedure.  “What if they tow the van?” she remarked several times through the day.  Bill kept reassuring her that this was unlikely.  When we got to where the van had been parked it was still there, although there was a $50 parking ticket on the windshield.  Warren, being Warren, ripped it up and threw it away.  A day or so later, Arlene wondered aloud if she had Lyme disease because she was so tired.  Because we’d been hiking some high-mileage days, there was good reason for her to be tired.  Bill fired back, “What if they tow the van?”  After that, the expression “what if they tow the van?” became our group response to any type of worrying.  A
The cost of our hotel room in Kent, CT: About every 10 days we had a town day to pick up mail, buy food, do laundry, and take a shower.  We hiked on these days and then were driven to town in the van.  We arrived tired, stinky, and bedraggled.  At most of these stops we made reservations to stay in a hotel.  Warren doesn’t approve of staying in hotels.  His philosophy of hiking the AT is that you should be able to hike it for next to nothing.  This is fine for him, but he tries to impose his philosophy on the group members.  And he makes fun of people for spending money.  At age 68 I resent someone telling me how to spend my money. 
When we approached our town stop in Kent, Connecticut we decided to book a room at the Fife and Drum Inn.  Arlene, Bill, Terri, and I booked a room together and split the cost.  The Fife and Drum is pricey but nice, and it’s on Main Street directly across from the only supermarket and laundromat in town.  That morning before we started hiking Warren asked, “Can I ask how much a room at this hotel costs?”  Arlene replied, “No.”  The next morning Warren asked Terri how much the room cost.  She replied, “My lips are sealed.”  Warren responded, “This is the first time any expedition members have ever stayed in that hotel.”  Arlene riposted, “Then you can add that to your book.”  
Call and response: Bill, who is cold-natured, loves summertime and everything about it.  Early in the hike, when we were learning how to follow the trail, the person in front would call out, “White blaze!” when she saw one.  Bill would call out, “Summertime!”  This was both an acknowledgement that he had heard and also an expression of happiness that summertime was here.  This became a call and response for everyone in the group. 
Are you still crazy? The night that Lizzie was admitted to the hospital our group was camping in a big public park in Port Clinton, PA.  Warren called us all together for a meeting.  He noted that our group has had way more injuries than any other expedition he has led.  In this context he told us that Lizzie wasn't coming back.  What?!?  Arlene, Bill, and I were stunned.  We just couldn't believe that she would quit.  We were extremely upset.  We decided to call her in the hospital to see if she really was going to quit.  We called and put her on speaker.  We talked for a while, but we were afraid to ask if she was quitting for fear that it might be true.  Finally Arlene bit the bullet and asked, ""Are you still crazy?""  What she meant was, are you still crazy enough to do the thru hike?  Lizzie answered that she was definitely still crazy, and we heaved a collective sigh of relief.  
Foods associated with each group member: Most nights Lizzie, Bill, Arlene, and I ate dinner together, and the whole group always shopped for food together, so we became really familiar with each other’s food preferences.  After a time I began to associate certain foods with each person.  I still think about them when I see these things in the grocery store.  Here are a few: Almond Joy bars - Lizzie;  red Twizzlers - Terri; dried mangos (which I’m now hooked on) and Takis - Arlene;  mint chocolate chip ice cream, mint chocolate M & Ms - Bill.  I have no idea what Rennie ate because he’d already eaten, brushed his teeth, and gotten ready for bed by the time I finished hiking each day.  I do know that he drank prodigious amounts of coffee and ate most of the food that the rest of us deposited in the communal food box.  
I miss living with my trail family, but we communicate almost daily by text, Facebook, or phone call.  Bill, Lizzie, Rennie, and I saw each other at Trail Days several weeks ago.  And most of us will be hiking the Allegheny Trail together the second half of June.  Stay tuned for my Allegheny Trail journal, coming soon.",,Home,"Jun 02, Sat",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592863,"Partway through my hike I prefaced a remark to my friend Moore, a previous thru hiker, with “when things get back to normal.”  He responded that things will never get back to normal after the hike.  At the time I thought he was exaggerating, but he was right, of course.  I learned so much from the hike, and I changed.  It’s not that I’m a different person.  I’m more the essential me than I was before: I’m more like the person I was at age 18 than the person I was at age 50.  My life is open to all sorts of possibilities that I never would have considered before.  My life feels large, open, and expansive.
Obviously, I learned a lot of hiking and camping skills: how to plot a way up steep rocks, use my knee as the first foothold and crawl up a rock when the lowest foothold is too high, use all parts of my body, even my head, to brace myself into position for a climb, use a tree to help get up or down a steep place, etc.  I can also set up my tent in no time and take it down just as fast.   I now have the presence of mind not to panic when I’ve lost the trail.  And, much as I hate being cold or wet, I now know that I can tolerate either for quite a while without losing my sense of humor. Recently I was hiking in the woods with a friend and came to a stream to be crossed.  There was no easy way to get across without just wading in.  My friend agonized for a long time trying to figure out a way to cross without getting wet.  I quickly realized that I’d be home and able to get dry socks and shoes in a few hours and just waded in.  Before my AT hike, I would have been on the bank with my friend trying my hardest not to get wet.  
But the most useful things I learned were things about myself.  I discovered that I’m far stronger, both mentally and physically, than I ever imagined.  I’ve overcome some of my fears of hiking in steep places, but the most important thing I’ve learned is that I can do things that really terrify me.  Knowing that makes life easier because it makes fear less important.  
I now look at my body in a whole new light.  Whereas before my body image was based on how I look, I now care more about what my body can do.  I love my feet and my legs - they're so strong and work so well.  I no longer automatically put on makeup in the morning.  And, unless I do something that makes me sweaty or stinky, I generally shower only every other day.  
Before I started hiking the AT I had no aspirations to be a long-distance hiker.  I only wanted to hike the AT.  I thought that achieving this goal would get it out of my system.  But it didn’t.  It made me want to do more long trails.  I started thinking about the Pacific Crest Trail.  I also want to hike the Allegheny Trail in West Virginia and the Camino de Santiago in Spain.  Being on the trail with hikers in their 20s and 30s made me acutely aware that the length of time in which I can do difficult hiking is limited.  So I plan to hike the most difficult trails first, while I still can, and save the easier ones for later. 
Hiking with the same small group of people - in essence, living with them - for the whole trail gave me the feeling of being in a family.  It was a real wrench to leave them at the end.  Leaving them made me realize how much I’d like to live near my own family.  So, after spending 38 years in West Virginia I’ve decided to move to Madison, Wisconsin to be near my sister Diane and her husband and children.  This is probably the most surprising fallout from my thru hike.  I’ll miss my friends and the mountains terribly, but I now know that I can make a new life elsewhere even though moving scares me.  Because I’ll be  leaving West Virginia soon I’m hiking the Allegheny Trail as a farewell tour.  Starting day is June 13.  I'll be journaling here.  Check it out.",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Sun",0
Sturdy Peasant,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608982,"Arlene's chingona earrings: Arlene comes from a long line of strong women.  These women are from a part of Mexico that has a design associated with it.  Arlene wore earrings of this design on the trail to remind herself that she too was such a strong woman.  She called them her chingona earrings (chingona means ""badass"" in Mexican Spanish).  One day when we were atop a mountain in an electrical storm, in a steep rocky open place that had to be crossed, I noticed that she didn't have the earrings on.  I asked her where they were.  She replied that she didn't want to tempt fate by wearing them in an electrical storm: it would be too ironic if lightning struck her badass earrings and killed her!
My AT soundtrack: For much of the trail music played in my head.  At first it came, unbidden, at times when I was hiking up a steep mountain or making a scary rocky climb or descent.  But after I learned how helpful it could be I started deliberately playing music in my head to help me remain calm and focused in challenging or difficult circumstances.  (I have a lot of music on my phone and could have played the music using earbuds, but I found it was just as easy without them.)  My dentist says I was using biofeedback techniques.  Here are the main songs: ""Siberia"", a Cole Porter song from the Cold War era musical Silk Stockings; ""Two Little Babes in the Woods"", another Cole Porter song; and ""King's Special"", a B.B. King song with a train-like beat, helped me keep a good rhythm when hiking up long or steep parts of the trail.  ""Lo Slo Bluze"", from the album Newport in New York 1972, helped keep me calm and focused when I had to climb or descend steep rocks using hands and feet.  I played George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" in sunny and celebratory moments.  Sometimes songs I don't know well, or even like, played, such as ""The Devil Came Down to Georgia"" by Charlie Daniels or ""Go Away, Little Girl"" by Bobby Vee.  And for several days the instrumental theme for the boat going down river in The African Queen played as an ear worm.   Where did that come from!?!  Sometimes it was troubling that my mind produced so much music when I didn't even want it but, on balance, it was helpful.
The difficulty of mental perseverance when the end is in sight: During the last hundred miles, and especially during the last week of the hike, it became extremely hard to get out of bed in the morning.  When the alarm went off I'd let out a groan of dread that I had to get up so early again.  I was so extremely tired, and the nights were so cold.  (Once I was up, I enjoyed hiking because this was the part of Maine where I grew up.)  I think the sudden dread was because the end was in sight: I could start to imagine that I soon wouldn't have to get up so early and work so hard every day.  For some reason this made it extra difficult to get up and do it again.  This lasted till the day we went up Katahdin.  That day we were so excited we were up early ready to go.","
